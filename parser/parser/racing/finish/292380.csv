												Racer 8 is...To be honest I can think of very little to say about Racer 8. It's so devoid of any identity that playing it hardly felt like I was interacting with a game at all. It's anonymous in the way that leaves you bored and begging the question why you ever decided to boot it up to begin with.The gist of what you'll be doing is rotating road tiles to guide your little race car through checkpoints and finally the end marker. And that's pretty much it. Levels roll into each other with the presence and distinction of an antisocial mouse, meekly existing until you grind your way through to the next one which seems to be almost identical to the level you just played.I'll come out and say that I wasn't able to keep myself awake long enough to play through the entirety of Racer 8, so take this review as coming from someone that's only tasted a portion of the game. But if what I didn't see is anything like what I did, then I'll rest easy knowing I got out early enough before my brain melted from prolonged exposure to extreme doses of monotony.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												Racer 8 is a casual, racing puzzler where you rotate the race track, which is divided into tiles, to reach the end of the race. There are a few constraints presented that make this task more difficult, like a fuel meter, changing weather patterns & tiles that change on their own, albeit with prior notice. There are power-ups that you can obtain that will benefit you along the race, like mitigating your rate of speed & granting more fuel. There is also a shop where you can purchase useful boosts at the beginning of each race, with the coins granted from winning races.Racer 8 does nothing particularly well. The graphics, gameplay & sound are all very generic. There isn’t anything to hold your interest longer than a couple minutes at a time.The only thing going for Racer 8 is that it is unique in the Puzzler genre, at least on the Steam platform. There isn’t anything remotely similar to it.			",445,200,8,42,22,2,33

												I like my racing games and I enjoy my puzzle games. Racer 8 is a budget shifting tile puzzle game where you must ensure that your racer makes it safely through a checkpoint and to the finish line. Each course is a mix of different tiles, curved tiles, three way turn tiles and a few crossroads. Think of a train on a track that can only go forward and rather than being the engineer, you're the one that ensures the track is laid out properly. If there's no track ahead, then you crash and need to restart the course again.I'll start off with the good. The game has pleasing, cute, simple almost cartoon in a way graphics. Everything looks sleek and uniform. You can purchase more cars and different paint jobs for them with the points you earn for racing. Each vehicle has its own stats for acceleration, deceleration and whatever 100% scr is. The game's help system could be a lot more informative than telling me what all of the menu icons are. Its all nice stuff that adds to the longevity of a game with at least fifty courses. Its sad that once a course is done, its done. There's no going back.Before you get to challenge those courses, you face a practice map that's like the others. You do this before anything else in the game. Its best to jump in head first and there's nothing difficult at the start. Once you're done with that, you get to go into the main menu.Since Racer 8 has a rally car theme, its a race and that consists of fuel, speed, a checkpoint, a finish and what amounts to jewels to collect on your way. Once you've been on the track for a while, the checkpoint will spawn and you'll need to rotate tiles to get the vehicle through the gate. With that done, after a few more seconds, the finish line will appear. You'll need to mind your fuel though.While I enjoy puzzle games, these tile puzzle games are among my least favorite, but it takes more than a bad genre to make a bad game. Its the glitches here and there. Things as simple as using the menu. I can click on leader boards, settings and stats to see them, but the problem is, there's no way out of them without closing the game. There are interfaces that look like they should slide up or down. They have arrows indicating it, but there is no mouse wheel support, but more surprising than that, clicking the up or down arrows does nothing as well. Trying to purchase a new vehicle for 200 points when I had 200 points told me that I did not have enough to make the purchase.Then there's playing the game, you click a tile to rotate it left, your right click to make it rotate right. That's simple enough, but to make things more challenging, certain tiles go under construction, making them a wildcard, because they can turn into any different tile. I'm fine with that, its part of the challenge to avoid them, but there are other tiles that shift without me telling them to. There's no warning that they will shift, it just happens. Worse than that, there are a few times when the vehicle has been on the road, about to leave the tile to a road that's connected and it just crashes as if it was driving down a highway with no turns, no cars and then slams into an invisible wall.There are no hot keys and to pause the game, you'll need to mouse click it. To control the racer's throttle, you'll need to click and drag it left to go slower or right to go faster. While faster might get you where you're going, it just takes your mouse away from the tiles it needs to be at. Tapping with a finger would be much better, but even then, you risk a tile rotating when you're busy messing with the speed. The further you drive, the faster the racer seems to go.Trees can obscure your vision of the course and tiles. Could you imagine if Tetris blocked out part of your screen? The game's camera is cumbersome. You need to click the camera icon and mess with a slider. The slider raises or lowers the camera and you can click and drag the camera around. It will always continue to look down on the map like its a chess board. Racer 8 is a touch screen for sure. A top down perspective would have been advantageous, but it would have taken away from the style the game has.Everything culminates in a bad game. A budget title with menus that force you to close the game, a less preferred genre in general with a problematic camera. Its difficult to recommend this game to anyone but tile puzzle lovers on touch screen devices. Even then, there are still issues to contend with.			",1122,324,51,104,96,15,167

												Racer 8 is a mobile-port puzzle game. The basic premise is this ""puzzle"" - a racing track - where the car moves around and you turn tiles to make a path to the finish line: not overly exciting, but a good time waster to have on your phone and are somewhere, waiting, and terribly bored. But that’s about all this game is, and it should have stayed as a phone game. The game’s graphics are decent, kinda cuteish, but definitely… generic. There’s nothing special about them, and it looks exactly like every other mobile game with cars.The splash screen forces you through the tutorial even when you've already played the game and clearly don't need it (there is a skip button, but in mine it wouldn’t work at all). So you go through the tutorial, start playing, and then get 100 pop ups telling you the exact same thing the tutorial screen just did. Ugh! Interrupt my gameplay why don't you?After the first round alone it gets boring and repetitive, which you could have kind of guessed it was, though I had somehow hoped it might be a bit more exciting and that the levels would provide a bit of a challenge further on. Not quite so. There are no graphic options, no sound options, not even volume options. In fact, there are NO options whatsoever. Even if it were to be a basic hi/low, on/off setting, you HAVE to have options in your game!To top it off, the music was pretty awful (and it was super loud), so I had to mute my entire computer to play. Way to go.Definitely steer clear from this one, unless it’s free again.			",753,484,13,105,82,9,90

While this costs 5€, which is ridiculous! You're just getting one map and what? 2 soundtracks? That's it, the only thing that changes is the weather. They could at least make it more entertaining and make more maps, add hazards to the map, vehicle upgrades, etc... They could really have made something entertaining to play while downloading something, but they gave us this instead. DO NOT BUY			",111,26,2,3,7,2,8

Racer 8 Review - Rating: 2.4/10General ImpressionRacer 8… this game has “Racer” in its title, meanwhile it isn’t even a racing game at all. The graphics and the textures are decent. The atmosphere varies a lot in terms of day/night or natural phenomes.  However, all the maps look almost the same. Just the way of twisting the tiles look slightly different. The audio and the music are both boring, and bad in my opinion. The gameplay is really boring, all you have to do is to move some tiles, meanwhile the car is moving. Oh, did I mention that the difficulty of this game is frustrating? It’s damn annoying to keep up with the fast car. Meanwhile the title says it’s a “racing game”…  It’s also a very boring and repetitive game. The user interface isn’t even existing almost, you don’t even have options for the game. The controls are clunky, I don’t like them. The engines are alright, I haven’t found any haven’t met any bugs, crashes, screen freezes or frame drops. The mechanics are meh, there’s nothing special about them. They are too repetitive as well. Overall, Racer 8 is a poor mobile port game which should be Free To Play, but I highly recommend skipping it.Positive PointsDecent graphics and texturesPretty stable enginesDecent mechanics Trading cardsLeaderboardsNeutral PointsSome more additional designs would be niceThere should be more music soundtracksSteam achievements would be a nice featureNegative PointsRepetitive atmosphereBoring audio and musicBoring and repetitive gameplayAlmost no existing user-interfaceClunky controlsMisleading titleA very high price tag ",649,156,18,43,60,10,68

												Are you dying for a car themed version of Pipe Dream? No? Well, that's not surprising, I doubt anyone else is either. Anyway, You click the parts of the race track to rotate them so they can turn where they need to go. The only part that is actually a challenge is that pieces of the track will frequently change to different pieces while you are playing so while you may think you actually have a connected course, nope, you don't. There seems to be powerups you can buy that make things trivially easy. You can crash and then... I am not sure if there is actually any set back to that. It says you have to buy repair but I am not sure what happens if you don't. Bottomline is, there is nothing terribly innovative or new about this Pipe Dream with a face lift. There is really no reason to get this game.			",209,76,6,38,27,4,62

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Puzzle (Im not kidding) game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere is no fullscreen mode.You are forced to play in windowed mode.You can't change you resolution Size.Music is bad and repetitive.There is a music and sound slidebar.Graphics are bad.About the game.This is a puzzle game. Yes believe it or not, This is a puzzle game. Yiou are not racing. The only thing what you are doing is switching puzzle pieces of Road together so that your car (which is driving automatic) is able to ride on it. If a road is not connected it will Crash because the driver is stupid enough to keep driving forward in his slow pace. Which means you have to restart over.Graphics is bad.Music is bad and annoying after awhile.Camera is bad.Able to pause the game.Only left mouse button is required.Other things.Highscore is totally hacked. Wow! this is the first time right? Just a big no. This isn't a racing game. This isn't worth your money, This isn't worth your steam badge. Just don't buy it.-------------------I Give this game a 2/10 ",469,170,6,45,49,1,62

												TL;DR This game is repetitive, easy and boring.Higher levels are supposed to be harder but the clouds that occassionally block your sight and the increased speed of changing tiles is obnoxious at best. Especially since you can buy an auto pilot after about level 4 or 5. Other than that each and every level is just like the previous one.I'm glad that I got this game for free, and I do not recommend picking it up for any price higher than that.Luckily, Steam lets you hide games from your library.

												Fundamentally flawed.Being a mobile port, its a very simple concept and it is as expected interface and graphics wise. The idea behimd this game is that you click on tiles to turn the track so your rally doesn't hit a dead end and crash, instead keep the car going along until a finish line tile eventually appears. The problem however is that while you have the typical straights, curves and four way junctions, there are tiles that split in mutliple directions, for example one where you approach and can go left, right or straight and one where you go left or right. You have no control over which way the driver will go at these tiles. None. He will randomly go left or right or straight on a whim without any indication from the game as to why that direction was chosen. He'll frequently follow to the left and instantly crash rather than follow and complete path you made to the right. Without the co-driver bonus, you don't even know which way he will go until he actually does it. The only control, the only gameplay element there is in this tiny, single concept game doesn't even work, leaving the game with nothing of value. How did the developer not notice this? Its the only thing in the game for christs sake and its bust. And if they did notice that a left/right/middle button is needed then they didn't even bother to do something. The developers should be ashamed of this game. More unnecasary crap on steam. More unnecasary crap on mobile.0/10			",197,52,12,22,45,1,6

There are obviously worse games in existence but to fail so spectacularly on every conceivable level at what is essentially Pipe Mania with a twist...Where do I even begin?-It deliberately obfuscates your view so you cant see whats happening with the track. (because what puzzler isnt improved by putting a load of crap in the way?)-The game will change tiles around which would be only a minor annoyance if it didnt constantly change the tile your car is just about to enter which just straight up kills you. (At one point it marked the very next tile for change so I had no choice but to go in to it and hope, I thought Id get across it before the change, but the tile switched while my car was wholly on top of it instantly destroying me...)-The shop contains items that largely do nothing but attempt to mitigate the terrible design choices of the main game.-You can buy new cars but the differences are barely noticable and the stats make no sense. -It has a variety of odd bugs like music tracks playing over each other, menus locking up, and periodic hangs. -Navigating the menu is an unresponsive nightmare in the first place. (Im not using a tablet you clowns, optimise your damn game if you want to sell it at four times the price on PC to subsidise your mobile crap.)-There is no aerial view in the camera angles and it resets the angle every game. -The list of your statistics are all wrong. (0 refuels? Not quite right...)-Try to get a better view of the course and it actually starts fogging out parts, which is apparently a feature.-If you run out of fuel as you get to the finish line the game doesnt know what to do with itself.-If you crash a huge crash logo comes up blocking your view. (Given the way it has a tendency to screw you up by changing tiles itd be nice to actually see what cheap crap the game pulled on you this time.)-25 levels in and they are all basically identical. It changes only in how many dumb things are getting in the way of you seeing what the hell is going on, and how long you have to put up with the frustration of playing the game.-Several times I collected every fuel icon that came up promptly and still ran out before the end. -Blue tokens you use to buy the upgrades that make the game at all playable are accrued at an insanely tedious rate while each upgrade can be lost in an instant setting you back dozens of games worth of collecting them each time.-Instant setting back dozens of games? Yeah, because all your upgrades are taken away the moment you crash for any reason including all of the unavoidable broken crashes Ive already mentioned.-In game power up items like fuel are sometimes trapped by the random way in which the board changes so you drive around for the next minute or so hoping for the board to change in a way that will let you collect it while slowly and inevitably leading up to you breaking down.-When I bought auto driver and changed some tiles to build a route to go down it switched the route already laid out causing the car to crash instantly. (It did actually give me a bit of a laugh, but I cant give the game a pass for being literally laughably terrible.)-Even though I had the tokens and some of the shop items are only available in the game, at no point would it let me buy them. Not while playing, not after a crash, not after running out of fuel. Sometimes I could, sometimes I couldnt.This is not an exhaustive list; I could go on (Scoreboard is messed up), and on (About page has broken overlapping text), almost every aspect has a half dozen levels of awful to get through. The entire approach appears to be 'Make the game as frustrating and broken as possible, then have them retry it dozens of times in order to buy ""upgrades"" that return the game to a semblance of playability.' This game type was perfected almost 30 years ago. This demonstration of how badly you can screw it up is almost impressive.At full price youd have to be profoundly masochistic to purchase this, but in case you see it on sale. I got it for 39pence, and part of why Im writing this review is because I think everyone involved in this game still owes me the satisfaction of ragging on this trash for having the gall to think they could sell it at any price...Im not a fan is basically what Im getting at. Stay well, well away.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's like the water pipe game just a really stupid version. I got it for free didn't like it then idled to get cards. 10/10 earnt myself a few cents from this would get it for free again. The game idea is okay but the controls are really buggy which makes the game crap. But this game should either be free or non existent. It's worse than some free mobile games which have entertained me on the toilet which this probably wouldn't do. 2/10 not a vroom vroom game			",195,19,7,25,6,2,26

												Racer 8  is neither a step forward or a step back when compared to its legendary original. It is in some ways better than the first and in some ways worse. It is really up to the player to determine if it is as up to par or even better than the first. I'll sum it up quickly in a PROS and CONS list.PROS - Amazing soundtrack as usual. Not as iconic as the first but definitely more versatile. - Slick retro graphics that are slightly improved and more vivid than the first. Soldier's missions also throw in a more hazy variety. And the last level...prepare yourself.- Cleverly written and delivered story that isn't shoved down your throat. In some ways it is open to interpretation, but it is more focused and clear than the original's narrative.- Interesting and engaging characters...whether you hate them or not (screw Manny Pardo though. You'll know why once you play the game). - Core gameplay itself is as slick as ever. Nothing new as the system was good to begin with.- Upcoming level editor for near endless replayability and experimentation. - GOTTA GET A GRIP!CONS- Some levels have very annoying level design with an abundance of windows. Level design is NOT the same as the original. It is one of the key break-offs and differences actually. Maps are significantly bigger and that is bittersweet. You will die a lot more times by a road off-screen that you couldn't see. This may also be because of slightly smarter AI and I believe field of vision.Overallscore: 14/88Score: 8/8			",40,4,3,0,2,0,3

												I want to slam this game for outright false advertising. I’m mean “Racer 8”? The thumbnail image is a collection of Micro Machine like cars plastered on a huge logo that looks like it’s right off a shelf at Toys R’ Us. Everything about it gives the vibe of a Micro Machine knock off. So what is Racer 8? It’s a tile rotating puzzle game.Was it my fault for judging this book by it’s cover and booting it up for the first time without looking at even a single screenshot? Absolutely. But I don’t care, this game was an outright disappointment. Not because it wasn't what I expected, I can learn to enjoy a lot of games regardless of my personal expectations, but even as a puzzle game Racer 8 is dreadful.Being a driving/racing themed game it needs speed; contrasting this is the fact that a puzzle game of this nature need to be slowly paced in order to give the player a fair chance at being able to think through and solve the board. When you bring these two things together it just causes a train wreck. I would love to see a game bring such opposite concepts together in a very natural and appealing way. Racer 8 is not that game.			",296,131,12,29,48,4,47

												This is not a great game. I’m not going to pretend it is. Anyone who reads my reviews and sees my game library knows that I’m an optimist and that I like to support dev’s with their kooky ideas.  But it’s unique, they decided to mix two of the randomest genres and see how it works and now we know the answer: not very well… To be very honest I’m rather surprised it sold as well as it did (I mean look at how many reviews it has!)Nevertheless, I am still going to give this a positive review. Why? Because despite the fact that the game is rather mad, it is playable and you can see the effort behind it. I had a rather good go at it and you can see the love the dev’s had for it, no matter what a poor idea it was!Maybe not a great game for adults (who are now the main customer base for dev’s) but perhaps it’s simplicity and repetitive nature may suit a child better.

Product received for free
												A good concept to bring back all those Pipe Dream/Pipe Mania games back to life, nice references to old rally cars from the 80's, the ingame money comes at a balanced pace and easy to complete trade cards collections.That's basically the only good things I can think of this game.On the other side, there were not a single effort to port this game on a computer correctly, the controls are stuck on this cluster♥♥♥♥ that is the tablet handling, I mean, I have a whole keyboard next to my mouse, a keyboard I could use to move that damn camera and change the car's speed without clicking on some random tile I wouldn't move, and even without the keyboard, my mouse have TWO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ buttons, why the hell these two buttons turn the tiles the same way? When did you guys though it would be a good idea to make a Pipe Mania game with only ONE way to turn the tiles?Also, the other thing that lacked effort is the soundtrack, the menu BGM is correct while being a bit loud, but the ingame soundtrack, the one the player is going to hear the most, is rather plain, boring and repetitive. First of all, one music for the gameplay is definitely not enough, especially if the game contains up to 50 levels; you guys could have hired some musician to compose something decent or even take some royalty free music somewhere, it's hardly a luxury.But not only the music sucks, the sound effects sucks as well! I usually don't really care if the powerup sounds like a grating fork on a chalkboard or a Super Mario sfx ripoff even if nowadays there's free softwares that could make ten time better, but the main problem is when the sound is playing. You don't put the same sound when a powerup appears as when it's collected and expect the players not being confused, it's like basic game design.On top of that, the game lacks finition, there is a bunch of bugs or incoherences that really feels like I'm playing some kind of open beta, simple things like not being able to buy anything if I have the exact same amount of money than the shown price, how the repair/refuel bonus works and how they definitely don't help, how scoring works, how only the first paintjob on cars has stickers while the other are plain paint...Okay so personnally I love Pipe Mania games, they are a good alternative to quick thinking gameplay (like Tetris); this game could have been a good game, there were the material, the graphism isnt so bad, the challenge is here, it has a start and an end. But there were not enough effort to make it a good game. Devs expected to give the exact same thing than their mobile game and get away with it. There is not even achievements to make me at least want to actually finish the game, the global high scores are broken but I still can't tell if these people cheated or if they're no-lifes that finished the game from level 1 to end without dying.On a last neutral note, I'm a bit surprised that the scoring counts how many tiles I've been through but not how fast I finished the level, I mean, it's also a racing game right?

												This is a direct port of a game made for mobile phones and tablets. As such, there is no keypad support, no fullscreen; only one mouse button and the option to connect to facebook. I mention the lack of keypad support because as of this moment, after traveling a mere 26 tiles (most of which were in a circle) my car has been stuck between two tiles for the past forty minutes, spinning its wheels endlessly as the map continues to change around it. Without an in-level menu screen my only options are to exit the game entirely by closing the window or to wait until I run out of gas. The latter seems like it's going to take a while, and having already left to make and subsequently eat breakfast, I figured I could write a review while it runs in the background.Racer 8 is a clone of the classic game Pipe Mania (or Pipe Dream in the US), only instead of using sections of pipe to redirect sewage (or ""flooz"") to a designated point, you click on sections of raceway to direct a small car around a map towards where you think a checkpoint or the finish line might appear; and unlike Pipe Mania's unobstructed view of your handiwork from above, Racer 8 gives you an isometric view of its cluttered, constantly-shifting raceways. And they are cluttered; part of the difficulty of these ""puzzles"" is that the game doesn't want you to see them, and even without rain, snow, and night driving, you'll have plenty of trees, penants, and banners obstructing your view. Clicking the Move Camera icon pauses the game and lets you get a better view for a few moments, but it won't let you get the best view for this kind of puzzle, that being from above and without so many stupid trees in the way.Even in those levels where you can see the road, any kind of planning or strategy is impossible. The goal of the game is to drive your car through the checkpoint tiles and, eventually, the finish line tile, but those tiles don't actually spawn at the start of the map; they show up at some prespecified time in a part of the map you have no way of knowing you should be heading towards, which makes the directions to ""head to the finish"" a bit of a cruel joke on the part of the developers. After that you have Men at Work signs, which section off one specific tile and change it into a random tile type. This isn't a problem when it chooses a tile a ways away from you or behind you, but it can instead choose to turn the tile directly in front of yours into a straightway facing the wrong direction and cause you to crash instantly. It might also turn it into a two- or three-way fork, which give no clear visual indication of which way the leadfooted elderly person driving your car is going to turn. Knowing which way Ardy Leadfoot is going to turn outside of the tutorial requires either some degree of prescience, or the unexplained Co-Driver upgrade, which at least gives you two tiles of warning.It was after buying the Co-Driver upgrade that I realised I had enough for the Auto-Driver upgrade. You would think you already had one, what with the car being beyond your control, but what it really does is rearrange the tiles in front of you so you don't crash, doing so at speeds beyond human ability. Yes, essentially you can upgrade the game to play itself, which I take as a sign that even the developers knew nobody would want to play this buggy piece of garbage.Pick it up for free if you can, farm it for the cards, then never touch it again.

												All you have to in this game is to change the road tiles so your car drives through the finish lines and pick up powerups. A game like this has been done before with water pipes or something like that, just not with cars (as far as I know). You can buy new cars or upgrades but overall the game is pretty boring.Racer 8 is and feels like an iOS game and would be ok on mobiles or facebook just not on Steam.			",1619,636,54,225,180,17,281

												First of all, there are way more creative names to give for a puzzle game. Yes, this game is actually more of a puzzle than a racing game. You basically rotate roads so that your car can move through and reach randomly generated bonuses, checkpoints and the finish line. This game will more likely frustrate you rather than make you enjoy it, and the reason for me seems that it is because of the road textures. It is not easy to recognize whether the road you rotated will make your car go left or right, except if you buy the ""power-up"" to have a second driver and then it will tell you of the path. There's been a lot of hate about this game, but I think it's an overall good puzzle game. The reason why I do not recommend this is because it could be better, for a game that is not entirely 3D or anything. There are trading cards for this, and this is one reason to just play (aka idle) the game. If you had a chance to take it for free, then go ahead and try it. As for you who wish to buy it, there are better puzzle and/or racing games.			",224,54,9,46,21,1,32

												Racer 8's interface was designed with mobile devices in mind, and it shows it.  You scroll through over-sized menu items by dragging the box up and down, ignoring the arrows which appear only to indicate you can.  The game starts windowed, and while a standard Alt+Enter grants you a less messy-looking fullscreen option, this only makes it harder to find the close window option, which you will want shortly after your first level.The game itself gives you a puzzle, ala Pipe Mania (circa 1989), except where your little car needs to travel is not clear from the start.  In fact, you have to mess around waiting for objectives to appear, so planning in advance is an option available only to better games than this.  As far as I can tell, there are no differences in the levels (I admit to not having played that many, wishing to retain a semblance of sanity in order to write this review) although it was raining on one level which I'm sure was nice.A special shout-out has to go to the Auto-Pilot ""upgrade"", which makes assumptions about you wanting to hit walls and fail, so changes routes for you accordingly.As a special treat, you can connect this game to your Facebook account.  The developers are clearly in touch with the demands of modern gaming, and should of course be applauded.Full disclosure: I got this game for free, though still feel a little over-charged.

												In general - it is a nice looking and kind of fun simple game. Of course the fun is only like 2-4 levels, then it starts to get boring, even if levels are harder to go. Unfortutanetlly 30 seconds wait for the first checkpoint to appear in the beggining of every level is pain in♥♥♥♥♥ Basically you have to keep your car moving circles until checkpoint appears and after that just reach the finish. It is a very monotonic game, all levels are barely changing, only something new is added. For example a track changer,which appears randomly and can duck (if you know what I mean) you up if you are not ready for it.  I really don't think this is a life changing game, not even a time skipping game. More likely this is one of those games, who appear on the Google Play shop - PlayForFree - with ads while you playing, but game itself just sucks. So here is the same completely smarthphone game, except you pay 4.99€ for all the ads you would get if you would play this on your smartphone. 3/10			",685,233,25,60,75,8,94

												A game so awesome that it sets the volume on high and won't let you get to a menu until after the tutorial.  The actual game is a new version of the pipes game from windows 98 with a bit of RNG to waste your time.  If you want a game that will actually make you question if you are more annoyed or bored then this game is for you.			",162,31,2,30,21,3,45

												This is not a racing game. This is a puzzle game.The car follows the track, and you can click to rotate each of the track pieces. Randomly, one piece will mutate into another one. And that's the entire gameplay.Why am I giving a negative review? Because...* The camera angle is terrible.* It would have been better if this game was a 2D game instead. Instead, by making it a 3D game with a fixed camera angle, the game gets artificially more difficult and more confusing. (actually, you can slightly change the camera height by clicking on a button at the left side of the screen, but the angle is still terrible)* The extraneous graphic elements, such as trees and even clouds, serve no purpose other than trying to look good and instead obscuring your view.* There is no animation for the track rotation. It just instantly rotates 90 degrees.* You can only click with the left mouse button. So, you can only rotate tracks in one direction.* There are no options. It runs in a window with a fixed size.* It has built-in coins to implement some kind of progression grinding. For what? For more cars! And for paint jobs!* It has some kind of Facebook integration, but it does not work.* The music gets annoying pretty fast.* It looks like a mobile game that was quickly ported to PC without much thought. Heck, even as a mobile game it is not good.* The game progress is saved at the Windows Registry.* It is boring.The PC Gaming Wiki lists some command-line options to change the resolution.I like the core gameplay concept, but I dislike this implementation. Avoid this game.			",612,229,21,38,55,9,66

												Laggy, boring, bland, and uncreative Racer 8 is anything but a racing game but rather a puzzle game, that while having potential has poor themeing, terrible music (that actually ended within 4 minutes of gameplay. Really, there's no looping music, but instead 4 solid minute of the same note that then suddenly comes to an abrupt stop.) and a tedious tutorial. Right from the start you are presented with a difficult puzzle tha discourages the player from ever progressing. One cannot even get to the main menu for options without passing this stressful ""tutorial"".			",116,16,5,6,5,2,3

												Racer 8 is a ground breaking new title from bethesda softworks, not only is it the only game in its genre it is the number one rated game on www.daddyhunt.com. I can not get enough. Not only does it fuel my need for masterbation it also doubles as a anti-depressant. This game is well worth the $69.99 I have not been able to pump more hours out of a single game in my abundant steam library. This game is better that badrats, the textures rival that of Super Mario 64. Sometimes you just have to sit down and pretend to be mission control of Columbia II, This game happens to allow you to do this with the all new NASA simulation mode. I would rate this game 10/10 Dartmans.			",10,0,0,1,0,0,0

												This game is BULL SHXT, pronounce with me again: ˈbʊlˌʃɪt. Basically I can't find an exit button on OSX version from the main menu, that's irritating. Typically I seldom give a fxck about bad games designed and sold on steam, with the exception of this hell which annoyed me a lot.And to this game, ahhhh I can't say please never buy it, but buy it ONLY in bundle from retailers like indiegala, even 90% discount in Steam is still worthless! Because after playing to level 10 I found it frustrating to get people looping in finding possible ways to the end without any meanings further, but not racing exactly! I'm fxcked up! Why should I be steeped into such bull shxt for trading cards! I'd play pipe connecting games instead of a load of so-called ""racer"" shìt! Game is amusing, at least make human beings fulfilled, or meat and drink to people but not let people do the same perishing action again and again, and who the hell want to get stuck in activity of redesigning faked roads? It's so devoid of freshness, yet badly supported on non-Windows platform.Hey producer, why don't you introduce in-game purchase of the shop for buying those virtual items? You can make much money! And your goal is, produce horrible games but earning much money!0/100 is the best figure for this!			",1017,359,35,129,134,6,191

												Really boring, but I got a free key, and it gave me trading cards.10/10, got 20 cents.If you want to know about the actual game, it's really boring. You switch which direction roads go in, while waiting for an incredibly slow car to go forward. And then that's the entire game.			",224,37,1,32,18,0,19

												WARNING: Kiss & 30.06 Studios were sued in an EU court for violating country trademarks.  The game gives an attribute to ""Creative UK.""  The court agreed that the game besmirched the reputation of the UK.  The developers were levied a sentence of no less than 10,000 hours of community service, barring any programming service.  The publishers were instructed by the court to remove the game from publication and remove all content from the hard drives of the innocent.  The publisher is embroiled in an appellate court with little chance of reversal; nevertheless, your rights as a consumer may be adversely affected if you purchase this game.TL;DR $0.24 is too much. Take for free, farm the cards. You cannot give this game away on SG because it was dispersed for free.I played this because I have time to burn on a terrible tablet game:1st, windowed in a 1200x900. 2nd, there is no map rotation except by dragging the mouse.  If you do not click on the narrow border, you will rotate a track tile or click off into a different application.3rd, tracks rotate only 1 direction--counter-clockwise.4th, the game has a mechanic of changing a track tile periodically to create panic.  This is a fine effect if warning were given 3 tracks in advance.  Instead, it warns you before you have a chance to change direction from the altered tile.  Then, the change happens 0.2 seconds before your car crashes on the changed tile.  If you are staring directly at your car, you have little chance of making a save.  If you are altering the path ahead of the car, there is no way to react to the  engine force-crashing the car.			",532,158,6,36,72,4,102

			Allahu Akbar		

(This game in a nutshell)Wow...that didn't last long....PLEASE tell me this was a school project....By the title, you'll assume, ""Huh...this will be a boring racing game"".   By that, you're half right, but also half wrong.  It's a boring puzzle game.  Didn't finish all 50 levels, but then again, why would I?   No achievements and all levels are pretty much the same thing.  (Stopped at level 11)You're essentially playing pipe dream, only with a single car, tiles that randomly change on you, and a fuel meter that acts as your time counter.  Expect to crash often and don't expect victory to be satisfying.Pros:Graphics look decent.May tickle the fancy of those who are puzzle fetishists.Card drops to sell.Not bugged.Cons:Monotonous.  (Same thing every stage.  Why have levels at all?)You're going to use a slow speed for most of the game, even though you can increase the speed at any given time.You click an option and the only way out is to reclick that same button (You'd think that pressing escape would be enough to back out...)Calling this game a ""Racer"" is false advertisement.Only real difficulty (That is...the change as you progress) is the gas limit (or time limit) and blindspots.No achievements (meaning no incentive for me to continue)As a project developed by 3 guys and tested by 6 people, there is not much here to be ""stellar"" about.  At least the game isn't bugged, so I can't fault the devs there.  But the imagination here is lacking.Personally, I don't really like it.    I only found it to be worth 18 minutes of gameplay (as of typing this review)....now to wait for the card drops....  But at least I got the game for free, so selling the cards will at least provide a profit.


Pretty much all this game is.  Don't expect to win... And when you do win, don't expect victory to be satisfying.

												MINIMUM: OS: Windows XP Processor: 486 DirectX: Version 9.0 Hard Drive: 30 MB available spaceRECOMMENDED: OS: Windows 7 Processor: i2 or equivalent DirectX: Version 10 Hard Drive: 30 MB available spaceTerrible specs.  I actually had no idea what a 486 processor was. I had to google to find out. It turns out it is an Intel processor, that was released in 1989. Cool!The i2 processor doesn't actually exist. And yes I did google it, just for the fun of it.DirectX 10 isn't needed, but at least they listed something that a)exists, and b)exists in the modern age.I'm fairly sure for the OS the train of thought was, 'huh, minimum OS...hmmm let's choose a random old OS....Ahh! XP! Perfect! Right, now onto recommended....hmm. Tough one. Let's choose a more modern OS....W7! Ah, perfect!""I say these things because the game is much like the specs. Not much thought given to the platform. From the start everything is 'touch', not click. The UI is classic mobile design. I don't actually know how to scroll down in the options. Clicking on the arrow doesn't do anything. WASD or the arrow keys doesn't do anything. The entire UI seems to be trial and error at times.As for the game, it's fairly okay when it's not glitching and the car just stops and doesn't bother moving again. It's a decent little puzzle game, it's a shame you are bombarded with annoying notifications about something appearing on the map. I can see that for myself, I have eyes!			",249,65,17,19,21,8,42

												I'm going to add to the multitude of already present negative reviews for this game.It's a mobile port, and it still is a mobile game. It's very boring. It's like those games where you make a path by switching tiles for some random thing (e.g. water, train, light, etc.)  but 3 dimensional. There's really nothing to the game. It still holds vestiges of it's mobile counterpart like the ""connect to facebook"" and that I still have to simulate swiping with my cursor in the store thing.Cards though so. . .

												Unpolished, broken, boredomContrary to the name, Racer 8 is a puzzle game (not a racing one). Gameplay is a mess. You start off with a car which you have to guide through checkpoints and then the finish line. Each level places you in a different course to play. After, going through the finish line the game will end, you will earn credits and be able to proceed to the next level. Credits are used in the store to buy new vehicles or change vehicle colour. The roads can be manipulated to change the direction the car is going. The car moves automatically and can't be controlled by the player. If the car reaches an unconnected road, it will crash and you will be forced to restart the level. You can choose to increase the rate the car is moving, although there is no point. The problem is that you have to manipulate the roads WHILE the car is still moving, with no option to stop it, so increasing the car's speed will hinder your efforts to manipulate the roads quick enough. Another problem is that the checkpoints and finish lines don't appear right away, so you are forced to 'juggle' the car before they appear. Another issue is that it is difficult to determine which direction the car will go at intersections as there is limited indication on the roads, therefore making it difficult to arrange. There are also a few menu issues as well as some menus require you to press on a different 'menu icon' to exit the current menu, while others require you to press the 'same menu' to exit. I wish there war an option to pause the game and view the map at the same time. Such an option would help the player to plan their road adjustments without the unnecessary pressure.Audio is forgettable. Music is isn't remarkable as the same title song is repeated in main menu. Gameplay music is quiet, but nothing special. There is no voice acting in the game.Graphics aren't that great. Terrain and vehicles lack texture detail. Models are simple as well.If you are looking for a good puzzle game, stay clear of 'Racer 8'.			",420,113,10,57,34,2,84

												Racer 8 is a casual, racing puzzler where you rotate the race track, which is divided into tiles, to reach the end of the race. There are a few constraints presented that make this task more difficult, like a fuel meter, changing weather patterns & tiles that change on their own, albeit with prior notice. There are power-ups that you can obtain that will benefit you along the race, like mitigating your rate of speed & granting more fuel. There is also a shop where you can purchase useful boosts at the beginning of each race, with the coins granted from winning races.Racer 8 does nothing particularly well. The graphics, gameplay & sound are all very generic. There isn’t anything to hold your interest longer than a couple minutes at a time.The only thing going for Racer 8 is that it is unique in the Puzzler genre, at least on the Steam platform. There isn’t anything remotely similar to it.			",59,11,4,6,8,0,1

												A simple game in which you flip the directions of road tiles to guide your car to the finish line.  The camera angle is not optimal, with trees on the tiles often obscuring your view of the car.  The tiles randomly switch their type, which provides an extra bit of challenge.  Unfortunately, this can happen directly in front of your car, with no time or room to prevent failing the level.  The aesthetic is almost cartoonish, but in a charming way.It's a nice-looking little time waster, but not worth  $5.00.			",112,15,1,9,5,0,11

I like cars and I thought this was like a cart racing game. But it turns out not to be. Hehe.I recommend this for ages 8-12 years old. This is a good game to stimulate brain fast thinking.

												It's fun except when your car is creeping along and the next tile starts flashing because it's about to change.  You just have to hope the car enters that tile before it changes or when it does change it'll continue to connect to your path.  Or it might not and you'll have a flash moment to rotate it into the correct position as your car crashes into it.Other than that it's pretty fun if you get it on sale.			",69,14,1,14,8,1,15

												This is a terrible mobile port. No options of any kind, so you have to listen to the terrible music loops, no way to accelerate the car, so you have to wait for ages, it randomly fails levels from what I can tell. My car crashed twice and as far as I saw it was not my fault, a block vanished under me and it was not marked as a block that was about to vanish. This game is embarassing. Not worth the 2 dollars I picked it up for.			",643,260,31,76,28,5,62

												I don't quite know what to say about Racer 8. It was free, and I couldn't resist, so I downloaded it. Frankly, so far the game's made me feel like I wasted my bandwidth. It's a boring point and click that's fun for the first few seconds, and drudgery after. If you need the trading cards, go ahead and get it for free on Indie Gala. A simple google search will get you the giveaway link. If you can't get it for free, don't get it at all. It's not worth your time.			",75,27,6,12,5,1,6

												This really doesn't suit me.Unless you like a game where the car drives at like 2MPH and all it requires you to do is click on a piece of track and it turns, then be my guest!The only feature of this game I came near to liking however was the Screens at the side of the Track which showed you a side-on view of the car. Otherwise, not much.Sorry, but I probably won't be playing this again.			",68,9,3,5,22,2,10

												I wanted to like this game, I really did.Unfortunately there are too many bugs to be able to recommend it.There is no ""Exit"" button, so you are using ALT-F4 to exit.There is no way to restart progress, even uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't do it.  (I assume I could hunt down the save file, and delete it, but that is honestly too much work for this mediocre game.)The help is not helpful.  For example, you can purchase a co-pilot, to show you where your path will lead several tiles out.  It worked for a couple rally's - 2 or 3 maybe? - then stopped, with no explaination of why, or if it was planned to be a temporary upgrade.The game shows promise.  I got it for free.  But if you have to pay for it my best advice is - don't.			",540,192,30,51,51,9,82

												It's based on a good idea but the implementation is inadequate. Very confusing and disturbing handling, mostly targets touch controls , probably because it's a mobile port. It features a very unpolished UI which doesn't even support 1920x1080 widescreen so you have to edit registry values to get it. NOT recommended (3/10).			",847,352,30,74,59,16,115

												I don't quite know what to say about Racer 8. It was free, and I couldn't resist, so I downloaded it. Frankly, so far the game's made me feel like I wasted my bandwidth. It's a boring point and click that's fun for the first few seconds, and drudgery after. If you need the trading cards, go ahead and get it for free on Indie Gala. A simple google search will get you the giveaway link. If you can't get it for free, don't get it at all. It's not worth your time.			",75,27,6,12,5,1,6

												Game is free and it drops cards. Those are the only pros I can think of. I know this is Indie game, but it looks like devs took no effort at all and attempted to create a game that is easy profit, easily sold to children. Cons:-Poor mechanics/gameplay - As one of the reviewers said, it's ""Water Pipes"" kind of game, but car instead of water and road instead of Pipes. You can't predict if the car will go where you want it to go (or I'm just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I need to say I tried to complete level 2 for few hours. No effect). Also the ""block changing"" mechanic in this game isn't any challenge. It's just frustrating.-Graphics - It was released on Steam in 2014. I think I don't have to say much more.-Price - In my opinion, 5 euros is too much to charge for such a ""game"". Maybe 0 euro is okay, but 5 is definiately too much. For comparsion, for 5 euros you can get such RACING games as: Carmageddon,Crash & Burn racing, Stuntmania reloaded and much more. You can also find better FREE games on browser. So, I can say it's not worth spending a dime on it. Get it for free as fast as possible, because no reason to spend money on it. Hopefully it will stay free forever or will become Free 2 Play.

												This will be a review for the game Racer 8 , it will cover and summerize every aspect of the game :It sucks.and no its not that the graphics or anything like that, the gameplay is very hard to control , the car moves in roads that can change directions , this has 1 problem , you almost never know if the car goes left or right and that will crash you and you will not go through the tutorial easly.

												Fails to capture the fun of rally racing immensely.It looks like a pipe mania clone with the pieces already laid out, where you have to rotate them into a ""track"", meanwhile you're aimlessly wandering around, waiting for the checkpoint and finish tiles to spawn. The game practically plays itself once the player gets the auto-pilot upgrade, and, judging from the way the menus scroll, it's a blatant port from a mobile platform.Worthless even as a free game, the only redeeming factor is the trading cards.
