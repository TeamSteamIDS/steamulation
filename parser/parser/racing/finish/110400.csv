												You run... you jump.. you shoot... you wall jump... you... do a lot of things in this game... its part racer, part platformer all... abstact awesome coolness as you race through landscapes that are once at home in the mind's eye as in grand old imagination land no texture edition. The tunes that accompany you seem quite well suited for the game as well.Just try it out, it's pretty fun both by yourself and with friends and the game has quite a skill ceiling. You just need a few races to get the hang of the game and its quirks but overall its a winner, especially at this low price point. The later tracks make the game more of a platformer than a racer but it's all good fun especially after you master them and can do them at a good clip. An overlooked and underrated gem.

												I really enjoyed my time with this game, but now that I'm at the point where I'm no longer likely to spend any more time with it I find myself being disappointed.  Let me explain.  This game handles speed really well and pulling off a flawless run feels great. There's a decent amount of content to keep you occupied, and there are some pretty well designed levels that are fun to play over and over. The core mechanics feel solid and are satisfying. Basically if you're into speedruning at all this should be right up your alley.   That being said there is certainly a huge lack of polish on this game. The game advertises multiple game modes but only one of them is really worth playing. The difficulty modes are an interesting idea but there certainly doesn't need to be as many of them as there are and some levels are (while all beatable) clearly not designed for the hardest one. Additionally its also impossible (from what I can see) to tell how many rockets you have left on the harder settings.   I really wish the devs stuck with this game a bit longer. While I am mostly satisfied with what I got. I can only imagine how great this game would have been with workshop support or even decent alternative game modes, but it looks like we wont be getting any of that.			",181,32,3,15,11,1,21

												I've had dreams like this game. If Oculus-Supported in the future, then a definite must-have. If anything, just freerunning in the Freestyle level.EDIT:Want this game to be easier, or Freestyle to be more fun? Play some AAAAAaaaaaaaaAAAAAAaaaaa!!!! (For the awesome) and learn how to fall (as in, learn how to aim your falls, especially at/beyond terminal velocity); and achieve the highest Ninja achievement in this game (the first level helps to learn), and it'll be a level you'll lose track of time in (didn't realize an hour passed while inside Freestyle until I wrote this review/recommendation, and saw the in-game clock).Being a 300/kph ninja that doesn't hit the ground? It's possible, and fun as hell. I can't wait for Oculus-Support for this. This is a pretty underrated gem.EDIT EDIT:As a suggestion to the developers (if still active), we need the ability to make maps. Although the vanilla set is fun and all, I want to check out other maps others would make, or come up with my own crazy♥♥♥♥♥parkour maps.			",507,102,23,37,48,4,78

												I want to like this game, but there are a few things holding it back:1) It just doesn't feel tight enough. Slipping at the same hurdle for the hundredth time is fine if you have a solid system where you can count your mistakes and rectify them--think Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy et al--but when you're slipping here and floating there it makes for a very frustrating experience.2) There's nothing to the single player. Honestly, it's not worth bothering with unless you're aiming to practice for multiplayer, because what you get is a set of empty arenas.3) They've made some strange graphical choices. In places it's borderline beautiful--a cross between Mirror's Edge and Marble Blast--and then you've got this horribly saturated collection of glares for an avatar.			",282,117,18,67,66,6,69

												inMomentum is one of those games that is a crebral feast of a platformer. Visually intensive as well as staggering in scale and scope. It makes you put every ounce of your capacity of lateral thinking into dancing and skipping across the massive, suspended maps in the fastest times possible, and punishes your dumb♥♥♥♥♥if you messed up a jump.This is a GREAT game. But sadly.......inMomentum is a huge disappointment.The game's trailer touts its 'Competitive First-Person Racing', 'Various Game Modes' with 'Over 30 Achievements'. But at time of writing the online multiplayer does not work, this in only one mode of play, and the achievements might as well as place holders because they have no funciton. Basically the game is not finished, and this almost throws me into a rage, because this is a FANTASTIC game, but if I can't play with other people Its nothing but a pointless time sink. I had bought this game with one steam friend specifically in mind who would go bananas for a game like this. But I can't play with them because the online is essentially broken. So until the developer fixes it, inMomentum is an awesome, paid beta.			",118,44,4,5,5,2,9

												I am not normally a fan of jumping games. I tend to get frustrated easily and don't usually have the dexterity required to be very successful at them. That said, inMomentum is a jumping game, but it shifts the paradigm somewhat in that the jumping is tethered to the mouse rather than the keyboard. Initially this seemed like a strange choice, but in reality, the game is so focused around jumping that it makes the most sense and gives the player the quickest control method. inMomentum features clean and bright Unreal engine graphics as well as a nicely made tutorial. I was especially impressed by the excellent soundtrack that matches well with the action without resorting to a pounding bass line. I liked the music so much, I would purchase this game just for the soundtrack. That said, if you enjoy games like Mirrors Edge or Prince of Persia where acrobatics take center stage, there is a lot to like in inMomentum.			",1051,328,48,158,114,10,216

This game handles amazingly and the controls seem so fluent once you get used to them, and the only thing that could make this better would be to have friends that had this :c None the less, I really recommend this game if you're itching for a new parkour-esque type game. What I recommend to the devs1. Level editor- I love the freestyle map, but I want to make a map with a flow of my style, get what I mean?2. Oculus Support- Ohgodyes that would just make the whole experience SO MUCH better.3. I know it might sound a bit weird, but weather effects. I would just like to see it be down pouring as I jump from wall to wall, running through the rain.8/10 would buy for friends.			",154,18,2,4,6,1,5

												The default controls are really awkward and difficult to get used to.  They can be customized, but there's just so many of them it is not really worth the effort.  Just expect a steep learning curve if you play.  This flaw could be easily fixed if the game just had controller support.Once you do learn the controls, you realize the game doesn't have much to offer.  There are only 12 levels and you do exactly the same thing in all of them.  The two solo game modes are literally identical, and the 4 game difficulty levels create no perceptible changes to the levels, so they might as well be identical too. The game clearly tailors to multiplayer races; however, no one is every playing multiplayer so the main source of content the game offers can never be accessed.Solo is boring.Multiplayer is impossible.inMomentum is an all-around failure of a game.

												inMomentum, a 1st person platformer based on running around a level collecting spheres. There is a large focus on speed, as you are encouraged to blast though the levels as quick as possible; as you are only fighting a timer. Unfortunately, the game feels very clumsy. While I'm sure you could master it in time, any time I tried to pick up any speed or do anything interesting I would fall into a pit (the levels are made of very small platforms and 90% pits). The only way to complete the level is to slowly walk though it in order to be careful, which in turn becomes very boring.Would not play again.			",1095,422,35,137,95,10,206

												I've craved this game for a long time, and when I finally bought it, I was left very disappointed.In a game where the gameplay it's uniquely about jumping and running around, if you built a physic engine that makes you feel as heavy and agile as an elephant, you did it wrong. Terribly wrong.If you like jumpmaze things buy DOOM2, then play the Jumpmaze mod with Zandronum; it's easier than you think, full of tutorials and, despite obvious engine's limitations, you can fill it up with HD textures and fancy effects so that even if it will never look as good as inMomentum, it will be an enjoyable jumpmaze experience. Definitely better than this.Average aesthetics, not remarkable, not despicable.+Sound Effects & Music-Physics Engine+Concept-ExecutionIf you need ratings: Graphic: 7Sound: 7Longevity: ?Gameplay: 24/10I am aware that a 2 is a very low rating but... As I've already said: if it's all about jumps and the physics are bad... They did it wrong. I recommend you to try the demo before buying it, if you like the game and feel comfortable with its physics, I guess that 10$ could be a fair price.Deadcore does what InMomentum tried to achieve, but does it right. Buy this instead.			",492,133,26,43,32,5,51

												If you expected a game similar to the Mirror's Edge Time Trial mode; prepare for (major) disappointment. The idea is there, it's just isn't executed in a fun way. The graphics are clean, which I like, Mirror's Edge used the same sort of style, but besides that it really can't be compared. Do like me and go play Mirror's Edge instead of wasting time and money on this thing. How many times have I used the words Mirror's Edge now ? Mirror's Edge. I lost count. Mirror's Edge ![Rating: 67/100]			",1657,631,69,221,194,16,225

												For such a basic game it really isn't as bad as I thought. The game focuses soley on movement and is great for training your patience and planning. It presents a new and interesting way of moving across an environment similar to Mirror's Edge with the exception of a few twists. It's very refreshing and addictive if you can get past the boring tutorial :P I'll be playing this one for a while.			",672,117,7,51,43,6,74

												The controls are awkward, unusual, inadequate, badly implemented, and nearly impossible to use properly. Even if you rebind the keys, there is simply no way to execute multiple commands while using both the mouse and keyboard to move about the game world. Sometimes it is necessary to use power-ups, and having five fingers in each hand is simply not enough for inMomentum. I am certain that after excessive amounts of practice, it becomes possible, but I am not sure if the trouble is worth it. There are barely any sound effects of any kind. You will hear the occasional beeps and bloops every once in a while, but that is all besides the continuous uninspired music. The game does not give you any indication that you are actually running around and jumping. There is no feeling involved with the movement and game physics. It is as if you are gliding from place to place, then floating, gliding some more, all with odd physics that do not blend well with the game's setting or anything that makes any sense at all. Timing your glides and floats so that you land on the platforms requires mostly luck, as the controls are incredibly imprecise, and do not allow for the player to develop any real skills or techniques in order to accomplish each level rapidly and properly. inMomentum does not have any story or introduction as to why you are doing this gliding and floating around on platforms collecting orbs and doing time trials. There is no campaign of any kind to speak of, and the only aspect of the game that provides feelings of accomplishment are found in online leaderboards for the two limited game modes available. The game is so bare bones, in fact, that you will wonder if it was actually finished, and if the developer should actually be expecting money for it. inMomentum is a cheap, unfinished, unpolished, bore. Play it every once in a while for five to ten minutes at a time in order to maximize your fun with it.inMomentum is mediocre.			",1292,339,60,143,147,16,197

												Won't lie I'm a little bit disappointed it's very multiplayer focused and because it's such an unrestricted game can only imagine the level experts completely destroying the noobs. On the plus side the time trial and general mode are great fun, really does cure a Mirrors Edge itch, it's also quite weightless and fast too when you gain momentum.			",158,151,3,5,8,2,15

												If only this game got some working on and more levels(plus a whole lot more recognition), it would've been an even better title! I absolutely love these kind of parkour games with high speed, lots of mobility, strong vibrant colors, etc.Basically what you do is try to get through a level as fast as possible in one of two different modes, time trail and sphere hunt. The game mechanics are built heavily around momentum and wall-jumping, which is most of what you do to chain throughout the levels in order to perfect your run times. The action takes place in a first-person perspective, but third-person can be activated by pressing G. Your in-game character can be customized with different colors and such, which is always a plus, especially for someone like me who likes to personalize along with my character. There really isn't that much more to it, so it's entirely up to you if you want to try the game or not.Like most games built on the unreal engine, the framerate is pre-capped at 62 FPS with vertical sync on by default, which can be changed in  steamapps-common-inMomentum-Engine-Config-BaseEngine.ini. There you can either change the maximum frame under MaxSmoothedFramerate(search for it with CTRL+F in your text editor), or remove the cap by changing bSmoothFrameRate=TRUE into bSmoothFrameRate=FALSE.For anyone interrested in a somewhat similar game that's a lot more recent, have a look into Celaria, which is a game on Indiedb that combines this with a lot more elements from Mirror's Edge! It's free since it's in alpha, but I think it so far has a lot of potential!			",164,15,4,7,12,2,7

Personally i just found the game to be really relaxing and i truly enjoyed running around the different maps. I could even have fun just cruising around the free roaming map in the game. I also adored the visuals in the game but i am a sucker for this kind of artstyle.			",554,123,25,77,58,3,63
