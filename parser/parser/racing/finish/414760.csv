												Good game, its fun to play.I like the gravity effect around the planet, you have to move smooth and accurate!Make sure to be patient at landings, if you go at to much speed your ship could crashWould be nice if they add some kind of trap that puts your ship in an orbit course, maybe this is already in the game, i will figure this out later when i play it again, but it was worth the review already!gg

												So far I am digging this game. The music and sfx are great. It is a little tough to get the hang of at first, but replaying and trying again are satisfying and it feels good to progress to new levels. I am using a keyboard right now but will try with a controller next time. The visual style is great. The combination of blue collar aesthetic and outer space remind me of the grittiness of Star Wars and Alien franchises, but with a humorous angle.			",26,2,1,3,1,0,0

												Blue-Collar Astronaut is a fun and challenging game. If you have hair, you have been warned as this tricky game will end up you pulling out all of it. Maybe wear an astronaut helmet so this does not happen... but I did enjoy it a lot and the graphics, music and humour are spot on. Give it a shot			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
