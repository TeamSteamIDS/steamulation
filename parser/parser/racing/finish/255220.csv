												Here are my neatly categorized observations about GRID Autosport (GA).►Controls:There are no dead zone options for my Logitec F310 gamepad. There are no options to reduce steering lag (speed of my joystick motion vs steering input). Several users report that a bug from GRID 2 has cropped up in GA concerning steering wheel support. You might have trouble getting your favorite wheel working with GA.►Physics: Sudden steering input does not result in under-steer as it should. The cars have a bias towards oversteer in almost every situation. Hitting debris such as broken car parts and cones has little to no effect. Everything feels like GRID 2 with more grip. The physics are not better than GRID 1.►Graphics:The graphics look pretty good; especially after installing the high rez pack. Frame rates are fast on my Nvidia 750ti. However, the graphics feel like a step back from GRID 2. The building models of Chicago look WAY better in GRID 2. Blur cannot be disabled in the cockpit. IncGamers review of GA speculates that Codemasters have retrofitted all of the car interiors from a free community mod from GRID 2. Also the RPM and speedometer needles don't move. XD►Voices:Teammates say the same thing over and over. If you improve your times on each lap he'll literally say the same thing ""thats the fastest lap this race"" over and over. This is a clear step back from GRID 1 and a FAR CRY from DiRT 2. ►AI:On ""very hard"" difficulty the AI becomes EXTREMELY aggressive. You'll get hit and spun worse than any EA title. At lower difficulty levels the AI does show some signs of personality and can be mildly entertaining. ►Online Gameplay:In online mode you (supposedly) can race with friends and compete on leader boards. You can also buy, sell and tune cars. Multi-player is dead; the lobby is always empty. I've spent 3 hours waiting. 1 Hour for Friday night, 1 for Saturday afternoon and 1 for Sunday morning. The result? Not a soul showed up. It probably has to do with the fact that there are so many reports of cheating. As for vehicle tuning I think its sad that a game like Gran Turismo 1 (from 1997) has a much more engrossing and detailed tuning system. The mods don't even feel all that effective. I tuned my engine, lowered the weight and adjusting my gearbox for a bit more acceleration (for a tight course). I'm a pretty good driver, holding several records on a few online racing sims. The result of my mods? Nadda. On average my lap times stayed the same. I call shenanigans!  ►Single Player Gameplay:Single player gameplay does NOT include buying, selling or tuning cars. This is a grave mistake considering the multi-player situation. In single-player you will drive what your team tells you to drive; like it or not. If you don't like open-wheel racers TOO BAD! You will drive open-wheel racers to progress the game; like it or not. All so you can earn XP to go on to more events. LAME. Sadly none of the team building from GRID 1 made it to GA. Too bad.►Summary:The game feels rushed and has poor production value. Models and program-code are reused from GRID 2 and possibly even ripped from free community mods. There is no motivation to race in single-player and there are no people to race in multi-player. All I wanted was to earn some dough, buy a car and tune it. And wouldn't it be fun to build a team and climb the charts? All in single player of course! I don't recommend this title on any level whatsoever. If you already own it I don't recommend buying the season pass. If you're looking for a great simcade grab GRID 1 or Need for Speed Shift (1 and 2 are both great). Heck, I'd even recommend Test Drive Unlimited 2 over this.Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Please push yes or no so I know if its helpful. :)			",271,49,59,19,50,1,64

UPDATED: 5th Sept 14 PatchThere is much emotion within the community in this latest instalment to the GRID series. It's been promoted as the ‘community's game’ with many of the new additions/changes from GRID 2 being done based on our feedback. Many love it & many despise it, with myself falling in the middle as I feel both viewpoints when I play. Although this may read as a negative (& long lol) review, let me state straight off the bat that GRID Autosport (GAS) is a solid racing game, its fast, challenging & fun to drive with a good selection of tracks (some new, some old), a decent range of balanced cars & various modes to choose from. At the end of the day that is what a good racing game should deliver & is why I give it a 'Thumbs Up' overall. It is easy to sink a lot of hours into GAS. That being said, although I do think this is a decent improvement over GRID 2 (and more closely aligned to GRID 1), it is still most lacking from being the definitive PC racing experience for me, so let me explain in more detail. One of the main disappointments for me was the Career mode. Actually, not really a Career it’s more an offline practice mode for your multiplayer career, as it primarily only a series of single events. Each series is a season (huh?), and you simply progress by completing each series in sequence for each racing discipline. Once you reach certain level, you unlock the GRID Tournament events which are larger playlist of all racing disciplines (with around 10 events). There are about 500 races in total which is approximately three times as many races as career in GRID 2, but this is basically it! It's boring!You cannot run your own team as in GRID 1, as in GAS you are a driver for hire, so no choice of car, livery or sponsors etc. Nothing to work towards collecting or unique events (like 24 Hours of Le Mans) to aim for, or other things you need to unlock... it’s just mindlessly follow the event list. Team co-op would have been nice to see in GAS, but obviously not setup with that in mind (focus clearly seems to be on Multiplayer, but more on that later). There is also no choice to specialise your career to say just Touring Cars or stick with one team, as you are forced to complete all disciplines & teams seem random based on the event. AI is an improvement to a degree, with much tougher competition to contend with from GRID1-2, which is a huge plus to the experience. They still suffer from being overly aggressive, will not honour racing line and will often cause you to have multiple restarts after the notorious first corner. Still with the improved physics, handling & damage models in GAS, it makes it less hurtful than getting hit by AI in GRID2, let’s say, but it remains a source of frustration. In the end it forces you to race aggressively too, rather than racing a 'proper' race.Likewise with the AI, it seems to have minimal randomness, from seemingly predictable lap times to the driving results. In offline 'ahem career' mode, your racing team mate will almost always finish last making it unlikely, even when you win every race, that your team will win the event. I also noticed some strange behaviour when team mate is winning all through the race & you overtake, he almost immediately drops position after position every time! Also a little odd, the AI seem to race faster than qualifying laps. You could be 6-8 seconds ahead in qualify, yet struggle to keep up in the race or find on some tracks the AI are always super-fast & others they are always super-slow; they seem predefined and not adaptable to your experience.AI get a boost at race start so you always play catch-up for the first few corners, which means you miss out on all the starting grid hustle or you start on pole and get taken out from behind! These sort of issues end up drawing your attention the more you play & end up breaking your immersion.Moving on from Career & AI, the Multiplayer online component of GAS has got more positive feature changes. There is a much longer progression curve, where you also level up your purchased cars to provide more modification. You can join a club (or create your own) & compete against your friends & the world. Clubs seem to be underutilised (no event creation, no group racing, no club vs club, limited in-game info/management). There is an improved Global Challenges with tough times & decent rewards. Overall, I have found the online racing experience to be much better than in GRID 2. Damage is more severe (& costly) although this unfortunately doesn't prevent bad drivers taking you out first corner, or any corner for that matter (Kick from game is improved tho :)). Matchmaking & finding games still needs much improvement. Online play is still region locked, which was a big issue in GRID 2 still not addressed for those outside of UK/US. It means for players like me in Australia, where online games are limited that I cannot race with others around the world without changing my Steam client region. This segments the community & is compounded by a lack of visibility of the games in progress to see what you might like to join. Matchmaking is good to have but not at the expense of manually finding games too; this is console-centric online play not PC in my view. You eventually give up trying to find a specific active game mode as it normally isn't populated with any active games anyways (& you don't know what is), so you just choose the Random playlist.It would have been great to also be able to create your own customised playlists in advance & save them for selection later online. So you can prepare as a host & setup some unique configurations for others to race.Most of these issues or limitations I have highlighted you can live with, although not as good as I expected, there is enough done decently to make it fun to race! Those that wanted the cockpit view however, may be disappointed as this is not much more than an in-car angle, blurry without a real cockpit functionality. Not an issue for me, but just to mention for others that might be an important factor.Omitted from the original release version due to issues was Time Trial mode. This has returned in the July 14 patch (in limited form). You can only choose the primary circuits (not the 100+ variations), no reverse tracks & selection is limited to the discipline. Still no friends times in career mode (ala GRID 2) nor any online times recorded. Great to have this feature finally to compete with your friends, but is lessened by limited implemenation. There are other artificial limitions throughout GAS, such as limited garage slots, limited custom cup events to 5, limited number of laps, or the extra long multiplayer grind. Rather than fixing some of these, CM instead brings out a XP Booster & Garage Pack DLCs for us to buy! These are a joke & are simply a money grabbing endeavor providing a solution to a problem they created. Shameful!Players from GRID 2 will also find a lot of reused components in GAS, such as cars/wheels/logos/livery patterns/tracks. This is not necessarily a bad thing to maximise the amount of content & customisation, but it does feel light on new content. I would have liked to see more of everything or at least some integrated modding support for community to create its own?GAS is still a blast but it's far from a perfect game. I think CM can do better which is why I feel disappointment seeing some of the corners cut in GAS (pun intended .. time penalty enforced!). The 4k UHD Texture pack brings GAS back up to code graphically, but still feels more like an expansion to GRID 2. Can't help but to feel its rushed & not well enough rounded (or refined) to be a real classic!If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!

												So, is it any good?Well, it depends on what you expect.But if you take it for what it is, you will discover a really good and enjoyable arcade racer!Nothing more, nothing less.It has good graphics, except for the blurry cockpit view, but with the dashboard cam I find it alright!Sound is alright too, and the tracks are nice and detailed.Even if some known tracks can be hard to recognize when you drive on them.The damage model is excellent, with cracked windows, scratches and dents, twisted metal, lost car parts and sparks!Your car will also be harder to drive and steer the more you crash / bump into things.There are many cars and championship events with thrilling, exciting races.10 hours in, and I have only scratched the surface of Modern touring championship and Open wheel, and tested some other modes.I do multiply the number of laps in options though.The AI is decent and somewhat competitive.They are agressive and will do some cheap blockings, but they just trying to keep their positions and I don't find them to agressive.What goes for the physics, I find it driveable and it handles better than Grid 1 did.So I think it will please many casual players!One thing I really don't like is the preprogrammed DLC!I also bought the Touring Legends pack, a good pack, but no download was needed after the purchase!..So they are already in the game, hidden away from us from the start!That is really, really low Codemasters!!So I say go for it!But don't buy the DLC, atleast not to full price, This kind of behavior from Devs should not be supported!!

												Grid Autosport Review.My 1st 15 hours with Grid Autosport.How did I get access to this you ask? Here's the shortish version.I'd just upgraded and sent my old parts to a friend who is currently out of work in Greece. Hi Miatakias He NEEDED to upgrade and no-one I knew wanted the bits. So off they went.He fitted them but after he installed his current GFX card drivers he got blank screen. Nothing we tried fixed it nor did any suggestions from these forums or others.Then I stumbled on an official 5 month old thread on their site saying a fix is still weeks away.Having 2 AMD 6970's on the go and a pair of replacements planned, I decided to send him one of my 6970's as well. For me it meant playing half speed for a while but at least I COULD play.Loore had sent me a message and asked me about Miatakias' problem, I told him the above story and that the GFX card was going soon. Miatakias was over the moon with the parts when we got them running and asked if I was going to buy GAS? if so he wanted to buy it for me as thank you for the parts I'd sent.I contacted Loore later to let him know all was now ok with the PC and how Miatakias reacted, I got this back.""Loore May 10Tell him not to buy your copy, I've got it covered  Consider it a reward for helping make the GRID community a better place.""Cool, a freebe for bein a nice guy and helping someone out To my surprise, when Loore contacted me again. He supplied me with a passcode for the game plus the access to the press preview levels and cars we've seen in vids. Stroll on!All hush, hush till now so here goes..A week with Grid Autosport.16 hours played and tested as I write this and upload some eyefinity vids.1st off. The big one... The handling, Is it any good? Did they listen to all the whining we did?Ooooohhh yes it's good VERY good, and yes again, they did listen to us fans of old and acted on it (or most of it so far?).FINALLY! After years of waiting, we get a trueblooded, direct descendant of Grids epic gameplay. Grippy cars on tarmac that you need to DRIVE to succeed. Slide any race car about like you had to in Grid 2 and you'll fail at the first corner.Driving Autosport right on the limits of speed vs grip round Istanbul Park intermediate and the old grey matter started fizzing again, those Grid ingrained responses to what I was seeing on screen and feeling through the wheel took over and the Grin was back.The assists are of the same style as Grid 1, where turning them off made every car soo much harder to control leading to slower lap times. Paradoxically though turning off the assists in GAS lead to the opposite, better times than I got when they were on. I might have been fighting with the stability control instead of letting it do its job here.Precise throttle control is critical for success but you reap the rewards for such restraint. so analogue controllers or wheels will do well, no idea regarding KB as I never had much in the way of KB skills to start with.Bear in mind this is press preview and not full release. Only 4GBs it's just the core game elements I'm playing with. I'm playing on this lot. AMD 9590 @5GHz, Asus Sabretooth Rev 2, 16GB DDR3 @2133MHz, Sapphire 8GB R9 290X all running 3 screens @ 5932x1080 maxxed out GFX, AA, AF settings etc with 50 fps as a minimum. Using my old and trusted DFGT wheel for the tricky bits.So Here's some vids of the basic career modes, All in eyefinity taken using fraps and saved using windows live movie maker. 1st up, Touring cars Istanbul Park Intermediate.The racing is just as much fun as the original Grid was for me. trading paint with a bit of shoulder barging here and there, got slapped by the corner cut system, so that works. The ""x5 race"" option made for same fun racing over 15 or 20 laps but be warned, In 1 event  I lead from pole and no contact with the AI cars, I lost 5th gear all the rest were fine this made the last 2 laps  somewhat interesting.

Like a tiny wee policeman pops up wherever you look saying ""Nothing to see here, move along..."" This has to be unfinished or the Modders got some work to do again....Again though, it's only the press preview surely it'll be better for launch dayhttp://youtu.be/bg79ms19tGoEndurance, be careful, this category bites.... No pit stops.Tyre wear in Grid? HUH? Well much as I wouldn't have missed it, it does add a big tactical element to your driving. In an 8 minute race grip dissapears like an ice cube in a volcano, I kid you not.1st try, I shot off into the blue, by the end of a lap I shredded 20% in less than 1:30 and had none for the end. You really neeed to nurse the tyres as on the 2nd try I used only 6% in one lap and still won the race albeit with 30 and 32% left of the rear tyres. Pit stops would help here but it's about tyre management instead of outright speed.http://youtu.be/mn1sr0ca4HIAs I said above it's the core of the game here and no where near complete, though with the way it handles, looks and plays right now I would be buying a copy without a shadow of a doubt.Ferreted about in the mp section and found a few gems when looking at tracks,You might wanna add to the confirmed track list RallyDriven http://forums.codemasters.com/discussion/289/grid-autosport-confirmed-cars-tracks-features/p1Autodromo Do AlgarveIndianapolisOkutamaHong KongRed Bull RingAutosport RacewayBarcelonaaaaaand SPAAAA!!!No other tracks/locations listed and no cars as a load is still locked in career mode or limited by it being in essence an abridged and unfinished version. If I find out there's more to it between now and launch I'll keep you posted while I work on some more vids.Post edited by SRS13Rastus1701 at 2:28PM			",18,1,11,1,1,0,3

												I like the game, but it's money waster, especially if you got GRID 2. This game looks like Codemasters looked at reviews and said ""Oh, they want cockpit view and proper physics instead of arcade♥♥♥♥♥♥we made in GRID2... Hmm, let's give them what they want. For full price. With Season Pass and 8 DLC packs planned. And won't make proper cockpit view. We're too lazy, we don't want to make detailed interiors - just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ textures without working dashboard and let's blur all that♥♥♥♥♥♥so players won't see how lazy we are""Seriously, even Watch Dogs has better cockpit view and it's not even racing game! Okay, so handling is a little better now - you can't just ""pedal to the metal"" and win the race - you need to use brakes more clever and watch your acceleration pedal/trigger. Yes, it's better than GRID 2, but it ain't deserve the rights to be new game and should be given to anyone who already bought GRID 2. Paying for this game is just... Worse than buying CoD every year, yeah.			",576,173,29,96,74,8,98

												Where to start...and keep in mind this is based on my singleplayer experience.The driving is awful. The cars wallow all over the place, the grip modeling is bizzarre, you have to brake at sim-like distances, though the AI does not--and meanwhile the AI's only goal is, seemingly, to wreck you at every opportunity, or at least shove you off the track or into the nearest barrier. They will honest-to-god plow into you at the startline if they can. It's like multiplayer with twelve-year-olds.The cockpit cam is pathetic. It's worse than the Grid 2 mod.No team of your own, no personal livery, no stable full of cars--just mercenarily jumping from sponsor to sponsor and racing whatever they have for you.The only reason I'd give this anything but a zero on a 0-10 scale is that it looks very nice, all things considered, and has a pretty interesting car list--that I will never fully get to experience because of the godawful nature of the basic game. It's a two at best.If you want an arcade racer, pick up the first game, or grab any of the NFS games. If you want a sim, Assetto Corsa is the answer. Reading through some of these other reviews, I'm boggled by the low standards and mean value to which people hold their entertainment dollar these days.			",56,13,9,8,2,0,0

												I feel that Grid Autosport is an unfinished game and therefore I would not recommend it.There's 5 disciplines in this game, Touring, Endurance, Tuner, street and Grid. The Tuner and Street disciplines are too similar and I feel it would have been better to have some sort of off-road discipline instead. Pros.Vehicle damage. From full on physical damage to progressive gearbox and clutch damage. Pretty visuals most of the time and everything outside looks clean and crisp. Good track atmosphere, planes, helicopters, crowds, pits and even tannoy announcements. Loads of cars on the track, gritty racing, when the A.I doesn't try and kill you. Neither good or bad.Driving physics, the mix of simulation and arcade isn't to my taste, it's more towards arcade than simulation and I would have liked it to feel more alive and direct. Often the cars feel like they float and you're not even connected to the tarmac.Disciplines, some people will think it's great to be able to choose ""5"" ""different"" disciplines for each season but if you don't like a discipline you still need to complete it in order to unlock the 5th discipline. There's no distinction in terms of race rules between the disciplines so they all feel so similar and that's my issue with them. Cons.The A.I is horrible, they just seem to follow a set path and totally ignore the player and as you might say they're on rails. Another issue with the A.I is their pace, they're extremely inconsistent, you can catch them quite easily but once you're in front of them suddenly they spring to life and you cannot shake them, unless they're Ravenwest Motorsport and once they're in front they're are extremely difficult to catch. The tracks. There's 22 full GP circuits, what CodeMasters have done is taken those 22 and then reversed them or used the Indy version of that circuit, basically the same circuit that has had a corner cut out to make it shorter and now CodeMasters claim Grid Autosport has 100 circuits. I guess CodeMasters are correct but the core aspect of the track is the same as all the others from that location and when you have 5 disciplines to create tracks for it means there's hardly any variations in each discipline. Loading times, I guess this will be improved in time with a patch but as of now there's a ton of loading times, even when you select a car you have to wait for the image of that car to load and it just seems so slow and clunky. Race seasons. You pick a discipline and take part in an event, it could be 1-10 races but for some horrible reason you have to race around a track, finish and then race the same track all over again just with a different grid order and it becomes boring very quickly. No pit stops! It's a game with full damage and without a pit stop there's no way to repair your vehicle so you're just stuck with the damage.Engine, cockpit and mirror visuals are non-existent, they are straight out of a PS1 game. Cockpit and mirrors are just blurred out so you can't see anything other than outlines and engines look like they were modelled for Minecraft. The disciplines all have the same race rules, full contact in touring cars is to be expected but it's also acceptable in Grid Autosport for full contact in open wheel events. No safety cars, warning flags etc Just T-bone the car in front and drive off without any consequences. No sense of speed, you could be doing 140mph and if feels like you're doing 30mph, it feels quite lazy and slow paced quite often. Online multi player is a mess, hordes of cheaters, clans who purposely crash in to you and constant disconnects.Grid Autosport has the makings of a great game but it's just not there, maybe CodeMasters bit off more than they could chew with this one, their previous game, F1 2013 which is just focused on F1 is much more refined, detailed, complete and if they had that kind of refinement in Grid Autosport it would have been an amazing game. Grid Autosport currently isn't average game but it's not a great game, I guess Grid Autosport gets a ""fair"" rating. 6.5/10.  ",82,7,6,10,14,0,10

												What a let down this game is.The career mode has left the idea of creating your own team, aquiring your own cars and teamates out in favour of the 'offer system' which was a fund saving option every season in the original GRID. By doing this you no longer have any personal attachement to the team, the car or your teamate who btw always seem to suck. The Ravenwest team is your constant rivals while leveling up, always one tier above the rest of the AI.  And whats your reward once you've jumped through all the hoops of said leveling? Driving for them of course! The team you've been drilled to loathe is suddenly your employer and youre supposed to feel proud? honored? pfffff.....The aquiring of cars and making your own livery is still present, but only in online modes.... which is divided between the challenges we know from previous iterations, sadly updated only weekly and only offering a single entry per class making buying a car kinda useless while starting out, since you'll most likely only be able to afford one car, the chances of getting to drive it are slim, since the challenge also needs to be for the right tier of vehicles.Or you could go for the other online mode - forced matchmaking...or wait no you can't because no one plays that.Mechanically the games is fine bar the rubberbanding which seems everpresent in all modes and the drifting which is horrible, gone are the linking up of high speed drifts from the original grid in favor of doing snail-paced burnouts while streering, easily doubling the score of the AI. In the race modes the AI are boring robots rarely doing anything out of the ordinary, no spin-outs, crashes or remarkable performances, every race will end with you first, then both Ravenwest drivers, then the rest of the field and lastly your teammate. It got so boring I spent and entire season just trying to run the Ravenwest drivers off the track... all i discovered was that the AI seem to have Scalectrix levels of front end grip.There are two bright points in the game however - Open wheel classes which have a distinct feel of downforce and good pace, and the managing of tire conditions in the Endurance mode. The latter should have been expanded to all modes and the pit-stops from the old TOCA games should have been brought back and this game would have been more than it is which is an incredible beacon of mediocrity 5/10.

												Where do i begin?-Physics-The Physics in this game are completely different from the past games, they are more like a simcadeIts not Assetto Corsa or Project Cars kind of simulation level but it still has a little touch as a Simcade game.-Cars-Haven't heard of half the cars in this game and didn't know they existed, surprised me a lot. just like Race Driver GRID back in 2008, full of surprises!And of course the detail in the cars is insane in terms of damage and such.-Tunning-I always wanted the customization at Autosport since 2008 and i finally got it!Finally i can set down force, suspensions, brakes bias, differential etc the way i always wanted!I can upgrade my engine, clutch and more stuff under my hood! insane!-Tracks-A huge amount of tracks in this game, all around Europe, Asia, Australia, America and more based on real life. as good as it gets they are big as well.-Graphics-Beautiful graphics, and my pc is not amazing and i still manage to run it on high with a 16:9 resolution and get a really good fps. so i'll admit, the game engine is as good as it is since always!-Car Sounds-Obviously not the only game which has really realistic engine sounds and definitely not the best one.But they are great and i love them, and they make me wanna boost my corsair all the way to 100% volume.-Multiplayer-Compared to GRID 2, this game finally brought back the wide space roads from GRID 2008 which means multiplayer is actually playable without having the whole lobby totaled at the first few corners.Match making is nice too, i can find races fast and easily without too much pain and also have a voice chat feature which is nice.Weekly/Daily multiplayer challenges are cool too.And i love the fact that i can buy whatever car i want again whether its a brand new car or a used car from ""ebay"". Just like the old days in GRID 2008!-Controller Support-Supports joypads, gamepads, wheel, keyboard and everything you can dream of.The game is also very balanced so its very playable with keyboard as well for a simcade.-Camera-Good to see the rewind feature is still here, very useful indeed!And the replay feature after finishing a race also has an option to hide hud and upload on youtube directly from the game. Also has various cameras positions which is cool as well.The only down sides of this game i could think of are:-A broken cockpit cam-Can't make my own team and hire my own team mates-No drifting mountains like the old days.But overall, i'm glad codemasters listened to the community and its requests and gave us most of the things we asked for.We were also introduced to Drag which is brand new to GRID which is cool as well! 8/10 from me, i really want those drift mountains.

YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: Grid Autosport 

			Views: 1,733		

			One year later Codemasters heads back to the track with Grid Autosport. Is this the game that fans of TOCA and Grid wanted last year or is it a quick and dirty cash in?		

 There are racing games for car lovers and there are racing games made for people that obsess with details of sending a car around a track as quickly as possible. Autosport caters to the latter. Those who enjoy buying, tuning and personalizing their dream cars should leave this game on the shelf. Grid Autosport offers very little theater, ditching the fictitious racing series and fake Sportscenter news clips in favor of no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t rubber on tarmac racing. Players will find that they are free to move between different touring car races, endurance races, open wheel racing, tuner events and street races. Players level up in each race type independently and in doing so they unlock new events and sponsors as well as Grid race series events. The freedom ends there however. Once an event is selected players are given the choice between two race teams who have pre selected cars and unappealing liveries. While certainly a realistic touch, it takes the joy out of earning your favorite rides and making them your own. Additionally, each sponsor has different objectives and tuning affinities. The higher their affinity for tuning the more settings players will have to tweak their machines so choosing a sponsor is more like choosing the difficulty of a series and additional experience can be earned by succeeding with an underdog team.  The realism continues once players are secured via five point harness behind the wheel. If you are expecting to be at the front of the pack then participating in qualifying is necessary. Forgoing qualifying laps mean fighting to the front of a dense 12 to 16 player field and contending with some seriously aggressive AI. An extensive damage model and strict penalties for cutting corners means that moving up a position or two is a bitter fight. It feels like an accomplishment to move through the pack but since most races consist of two or three laps aggressive racing is essential and often times you will find yourself crossing the finish line with a car that has wrecked steering and is not pushing as much horsepower as when the race started. Race ending collisions can occur and like Grid 2 the damage models set a genre standard. Unfortunately, qualifying means completing every race twice and qualifying isn't a possibility for certain race series. For those who don't have an obsession with cleaving a tenth of a second off of a lap time it's tedious.  Also complicating matters is the fact that most race events have you teamed up with an AI driver who helps determine your placement in the team standings at the end of a season. Perhaps I made a habit of selecting the wrong sponsor, but my teammates all seemed to be tailpipe fetishists who were content to follow the entire field. While it is possible to order commands for your teammate to drive more aggressively or hold their position it seems to have little effect other than hearing your partner spin out if you forget to back them off of the most aggressive behavior setting. Fortunately, the opponent AI also makes mistakes but all too often the work you put into capturing a podium finish is undermined by your teammate, ultimately costing you valuable experience at the end of the season. Gaining experience is essential to progressing through the career so it doesn't take long before the game feels like a grind. Variety is a hallmark of the Grid series and Autosport offers touring car racing, endurance racing, open wheel racing, street racing and tuner racing. Endurance races take place over a fixed time and the driver that travels the furthest in the allotted time wins. It's is possibly the most challenging race type since careful and consistent driving is required to stay at the front of the pack and protect the soft rubber that keeps your machine on the road. Open wheel racers are incredibly fragile and the threshold between cornering at max speed and being murdered in a nasty crash is thinner than a human hair. Open wheel racing in Autosport is not as complex as Codemasters' own F1 series since adaptive aerodynamics and the KERS system have been omitted but never the less offers a commendable and accessible experience. Tuner races are largely comprised of time attacks and drift events. Street races tend to be the most enjoyable events simply because the excise the game's long list of real world grand prix tracks in favor of the more detailed city based tracks. Finally, touring car events adhere to the addage of rubbing is racing by placing you behind the wheel of road cars tuned to unrecognizable specifications while you bump and bash your way through corners defending your position against a tightly knit field of racers. Sadly, togue events are absent from Autosport and the live route system—possibly one of the most intriguing features in a racing game in years is also absent. Additionally, players varying tastes means that some events will become a tremendous test of patience for some and leveling across all event types is essential to unlock Grid events. Once again the vehicle selection is slim but covers a tremendous variety of machines, including the platypus of the automotive world: the Aussie Ute.  Online is much the same in Autosport as it was in Grid 2 with both weekly challenge events and direct competition with 11 other drivers. Cars have to be earned one by one and leveling up each of the racing disciplines contributes to your overall level and unlocks more slots in your garage. Each car must be leveled up through use, unlocking tuning options and upgrades. This proves to be highly problematic however since it takes an absurd amount of time to unlock enough tuning options for the feature to be usable. Tuning is a delicate art—the kind of thing you would do with a scalpel and Autosport's initial instinct is to provide you with a jackhammer. Tuning options are controlled via sliders and the greater your affinity for tuning, the more settings available along the slider. Also the way vehicle availability is divided between race types and classes within each race type means that it's hard to dedicate yourself to using a single vehicle in order to upgrade it. All this comes together to make online play a grind of it's own. Autosport does provide an excellent assortment of tracks across it's single player and online suits, many of the tracks in Grid 2 can be found here as well as a large selection of new Grand Prix tracks—many of which are not found in any other mainstream racing games. The most exciting inclusion is the brand new Circut of the Americas with it's tight hairpins, long straits and winding sections. While Codemasters has included a number of details that liven up the real life Gran Prix tracks, races through the game's cityscapes is far more captivating and lively. Presentation wise, Autosport maintains the same high quality as Grid 2 but by popular demand a cockpit view has been added. Corners have been cut however with a depth of field filter that blurs the detals in the cockpit. utosport makes some strides toward addressing the issues that many TOCA and Grid fans had with Grid 2 but features enough quirks and questionable design choices to remain frustrating. It's a game that caters to serious race fans and shrugs off features that lend themselves toward giving players a sense of progression. You are simply a driver tied to a team that you are in no way invested in, who is, in turn, leashed to a corporate sponsor. It's a bit of realism that most gamers could do without. Autosport is a challenging racing game with perfect handling and tenacious AI but the dense racing fields and low lap counts combined with a rigorous damage model can irritate. Extensive plans for DLC also raise eyebrows and will likely cause would be wheel-men to steer around this entry.			",1843,697,76,250,218,18,319

												I'm only 5 and a half hours into the game, so take what I say with that in mind. I'm also an intermediate level racer.I like the ""sim-cade"" genre, I like Gran Turismo and Forza a whole lot. Unfortunately, Neither Sony or Microsoft would ever see those particular cash cows on the PC. GRID is one of the few options on PC. Okay, usual complaints that PC gamers have on console ports- Controller oriented UI. Still, not nearly as bad as say, SHIFT 2 was. Uneven graphics. Wierd sound stuff. (I noticed it most when driving an open wheel car, the wind sound would go away if I looked side to side or behind me.)On to the meat-Limited Tuning, you can't really fine tune the car, just move some sliders around.The team offers thing is wonky- yeah I get it, you only have so much choice in pro-level racing who you drive for and who's graphics are on your car. But it's a game. Come on man. Cars are extra, super, crazy tail happy- I expect this from a heavy, vintage V8 Sedan, NOT a super high downforce openwheel car. The opening level GT's are nearly undrivable in my feeling. The Dalara F312 has HORRID snap oversteer even when you click all those dumb sliders to what should be the most stable settings. It's an open wheel car, it has tremendous mechanical grip AND downforce, I expect it to get loose if I kill all that downforce but NOT when I'm at speed.The AI is set to murder- they don't do clean racing. They love to shunt you, cut you and generally drive like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Every race is a street fight in this game.It makes you Drift. Drifting isn't racing. Drifting is a hell of a show, but it isn't racing and I've never enjoyed it. (I prefer to get my drift on running tail-happy Sixties race cars or Rally cars in various other games.)Unlicensed/Fake cars. :(The pricing/amount of DLC is silly. I bought the Drag pack because of how poorly represented that aspect of motorsports have been in the game world... It does it half right at best. Staging is there but it leaves out the burnout box. It just doesn't feel right anyhow. Also, I bought the game on impulse, I broke my own rule- ""Don't pay Codemasters again until they FIX Dirt3."" I still want them to fix Dirt3.4/2/15 HEY THEY FIXED DIRT3 THATS COOL. STILL DON'T LIKE GRID. :D			",98,11,27,20,33,1,21

												Codemasters had a plan when they rebranded under the Codemasters Racing Studio banner. That plan was to have the GRID and Dirt franchises to release a game every other year in syncopation. This started with Dirt Showdown, followed by GRID 2. However, Codemasters have abandoned their plan after only a single iteration. Possibly in part to the release of the next generation of consoles and the learning curve required in developing for the new platform, but ultimately it can be put down to the fact that GRID 2 received such a mixed reception from the fans. No cockpit view? A story driven racing game? What were Codemasters thinking?So what is GRID Autosport then? Codemasters claim that the “time and technology were right” to release another version, only a year later than GRID 2 had graced our shelves. What the fans really think is that GRID Autosport is an apology for GRID 2. One thing is for sure, it’s a fine game.Codemasters went to a lot of effort in listening to their fans. One of the biggest gripes of GRID 2 was the lack of a cockpit view. Well GRID Autosport has two of them. Codemasters reason for leaving it out of GRID 2 made a lot of sense, saving on resources that could be better used making the rest of the game beautiful, something they definitely achieved. So while GRID Autosport has brought back in the cockpit view, it is relatively low detail, with no sign of dials or monitors anywhere on the dash to provide feedback to the player. This is still a bit of a sticking point, especially when the player is encouraged to play without any UI for an extra XP reward bonus each race.The difficulty settings are pretty much back to the way they were in the original GRID. You get a set XP reward from your performance during a season, and this can be enhanced depending on the difficulty settings you pick. Not just the level of the AI, but driving assists, forcing the view to cockpit only and driving with no UI all help raise your XP bonus. It is rather key then that with the low end internal view that Codemasters provided some further form of feedback to the player. This is done in terms of a race engineer. In previous games the race engineer came onto the radio when the game felt the need, start of every lap, after a bad crash etc. In GRID Autosport you can request information from him at any point. Your position, your team mates position, your rivals position and a damage report are all just a button press away. This works really well during races, but Codemasters have still slightly missed out here by not having it available during the timed events or qualifying sessions.A gripe of mine when it came to GRID 2 was the forcing of multidiscipline play. The GRID series has its origins set from the TOCA Touring Car games, and it has always been what they have done best. GRID Autosport goes some way to correcting this by getting rid of the whole story based driving idea and focusing a lot more on circuits over open road tracks. The selection of tracks is not huge, twenty two locations combine to provide over a hundred different track layouts. There are a couple of new tracks in there, but the majority of them are old favourites.You can race on these tracks across the set disciplines available in GRID Autosport. These are Touring, Open Wheel, Endurance, Tuner and Street. The set up is a lot more like the original GRID where each season you pick a discipline, then select an event from that discipline to race in over the course of that season. Each event category will give you a couple of driver offers to chose from, with season objects set and XP rewards in that discipline for completing them. Once you reach level three in all disciplines you unlock the first of the GRID Championships.If you chose to complete a GRID Championship season you will compete across all disciplines, but the season objectives will be challenging yet rewarding. These are probably the best way to boost your XP across all the disciplines.However, if you are like me then you will prefer one or two disciplines over the others. In fact, I see no reason for some of these to be in here at all. Tuner, for example, is mostly filled with Time Trial and Drift events. Who plays these? The Open Wheel discipline is nice, but all it does is make me look forward to the next F1 game. I wouldn’t be upset if these two categories were not in the game. Street is good, it has been a strong part in all the GRID games, though the loss of Live Routes is a shame, as it was easily the best feature in GRID 2. Endurance requires a lot of skill, with the minimum length of races being eight minutes and tire wear playing a huge part in each race. Endurance racing is very much about consistency, and it’s the discipline where you see AI mistakes more than any other. Touring is the bread and butter though. I’ve already mentioned that the GRID roots are in the TOCA series, and to be honest, I’d love to see Codemasters go back and make a pure TOCA game again, and I don’t think I’m alone.The multiplayer side of the game works off the same experience system as the single player, with every race providing you with XP in the selected discipline. To begin with you will be loaning a car in each race you enter, but once you own a car you can start competing with it if the right events show up in your playlist. Codemasters have gone to a lot of effort to make the online experience a lot more personal. You can customise cars you own in terms of livery and sponsors, but each race also earns the car XP which will unlock upgrades for it.Overall GRID Autosport has taken a step backwards, but in a good way. One big shame in single player is that you never form your own team like in the original GRID, picking the livery and sponsors. You are just constantly a driver for hire. The discipline system works well though, and if you are not bothered about the GRID Championships then you can just stick to what you enjoy.			",2249,864,87,235,309,22,348

												Well this is the third Grid game which is surprisingly long and giving much more motorsport than the second one. After playing Grid 2 i felt like playing the different version of NFS: Hot Pursuit because of the enviroment and the race types. With this game Codemasters give us a hope for a future realistic Grid games that may be possible to come out. Let's make a quick review with pros and cons.+Long and challenging gameplay                                        +Simple menu and racing menu interface+Good graphics and car details+Team radio is better than the other two games+Five different classes-I believe there is a hidden Dlc in this game called The Dumbest Teammate in this World. No matter which team you are racing for your teammate is an idiot.-After playing 30 hours or much game is just repeating itself.-You can't choose your teammate like in the first game.-This whiteline penalty...It is so sensitive and it doesn't show how many seconds you take the penalty.-I don't understand why there is a utopic team named Ravenwest Motorsport.Nevermind my cons review this game is good than worth buying. I recommend all for the Grid lovers.			",345,94,9,52,15,2,28

												+ Dazzling array of cars+ Great-sounding engine noises- Cockpit view is low-res, blurry, and the needles don't even move- Cars seem to handle like a barge. With wheels. That is aquaplaning. On the Moon.- AI seem to have two modes: religiously follow driving line; or swipe me off the track.- Damage modelling is rough. I only seem to pick up minor scratches, and then lose parts of my car. Damage model doesn't seem very realistic. In fact, it doesn't even seem to be satisfyingly unrealistic. Just bits falling off. - Game seems horribly unoptimised for my set-up. Alas.All in all, I would say that this game is a waste of £29.99. I'm glad I got it for free when I bought this PC, because there was no way I would buy this on sale. 11/10 - IGN			",96,18,6,6,8,0,2

												I'm playing this on Linux with a GTX 660 and the NVIDIA drivers. I'm usually not much of a racing guy, but I'm quite enjoying this game.Pros  No crashes or hiccups  Runs at 60 FPS Minimum on high settings at 1080p  Nice visuals and sounds, pretty UI, extensive options menu  Picked up my DualShock 4 controller right away without me doing anything  Currently the best racing game on Linux (there's really not that many)  Variety of tracks, modes and cars  Detailed difficulty settings, making it easy for players of all backgrounds to quickly feel at home  Detailed visual customization of cars in multiplayerNeutral  If you're using a less popular controller, the game won't save your controls. You can create a keymap with controllermap and paste it into this file: GRID Autosport/share/controllermapping.txtCons  Absolutely zero customization of your cars in singleplayer  Razer and Monster Energy advertisement plastered over cars and along tracks.Looking forward to more Linux ports of this publisher's games! DiRT Rally please?			",97,10,2,7,3,0,3

												After playing Grid 2 and having mixed, mostly-positive feelings, I was hoping Autosport would win me over. It did not. I'd definitely recommend Grid 2 over this game, and if you've already played 2, don't bother with Autosport.My biggest problem is with the driving physics (which are similar to Grid 2). I get that it's an arcade racer; that's fine. But the cars don't feel like they have 4 wheels contacting the ground. They're more than just ""floaty"". They are kind of like cardboard with a pencil stuck through the middle. When you turn, the car seems to pivot around its center (you can feel the rear wheels swing out). So I'll brake before a turn, start turning in, and keep traction through the turn. But while doing this, the car has pivoted and feels like it's drifting... but I have traction?... it's a bizarre sensation and just feels ""wrong"".As a comparison: Project Gotham Racing was an arcade racer that nailed driving physics. Even though PGR was arcadey, the cars felt weighty and had momentum. You could feel the road under the wheels and could tell when you made little mistakes. Very satisfying to master. Grid's physics don't have that magic at all.Beyond that, Autosport's career mode is dull. My experience with Grid 2 was that, in spite of the poor physics, the career's trickle of exciting tracks and cars kept me playing. However, I do not feel this in Grid Autosport. Your career progress is only portrayed through menus, and everything (everything!) boils down to filling XP bars. Gone is the illusion of building up a racing career, gone is collecting cars, gone is my garage. For the first few races I was actually confused: ""what is my GOAL here?"" It turns out: I don't need to win, I don't need to beat my rivals, I don't need to finish objectives. I just need to play enough to fill XP bars up.Couple that with the fact that most of the tracks are straight from Grid 2, and I'm left super disappointed. It's a shame because I've always liked Codemaster's Colin McRae and Dirt series. I want to like this game, but I can't.			",177,37,18,17,20,7,17

												Ok about time for a review, I have had enough hrs in this game to give a fairly clinical observationSure it will be biased but in the end I will as objective as possibleSo game play overall? let's just say with some tweaking once you upgrade your cars, you can have some serious grin timeNow let's explore this, you need to grind to upgrade your cars, and by grind I mean go online and compete either with real players or AIIt can get repetitive but don't let this fool you into thinking this game is shallowThe grind is arduous, I prefer not to race online as then you are forced to have your ""download"" set to UK servers which will cause latency issuesPeople who think otherwise, really don't understand how ""networking"" worksSo having left my ""downlaod"" set to UK, iI found my actual game downloads were notoriously slow, so make sure you return to your regional setting if not playing this online with real opponentsLiving in Australia gives me around 250+ ping to UK, so this kind of ruins any sort of gaming with others, which is this game's achillies heelThey ruined it by having so little servers populated that you are forced into a UK regionSo what next? there is always online events to participate in, and these rotate every 100 hrs or so, compete in these (grinding) with a bought car and this is how you can become more competetive if you so wish to play against real peopleOtherwise it's a fools paradise trying to compete with peopel who have already maxed out their resepctive carsThis should never been implemented in this game, everyone should have the same car, or similar in class So how does this compare with two other car games of similar context?Grid 2: GAS is muuch more realistic and has tunable cars once unlocked, and what I mean is once you meet level requirements, you can now adjust suspensin, diff, brakes etc etcMakes gaming much better and AI seem more behaved tooSo about the AI, something good in GAS make you realize that AI do not hap hazardly just RAM you, they can be aggressive, but it all depends where you are in the racing lineI spun out today, car behind me actually braked and would not try and go around, so not only was I not rammed, but I was given time to get back on track, good touch imoSo on the other end of the spectrum we have Project Cars:GAS does so much more, better and just with more reward, I'll explain.pC has ground breaking bugs where cars AI pass you on the greass, or you pit only to come out with flat tires, or crap where everyone is online and race starts but suddenly you lose ability to use your wheel?See pC is pretentious and gets so many things wrong than right, GAS on teh otehr hand is the underdog just prodding along and almost championing what it can do, but alas falls just short It's lack of specific tracks that ruin it for me, specifically NordsSo out of the 3 games, I prefer GAS based on: Quick play and rewardGreat graphics, but not as good as pCGood AI with challenging game playNice tweaking options of cars without being too complexDifferent styles of driving, ie drag racing, destruction derby, drifting to name a fewIs this the creme de le creme car game? no, does it offer a lot to kleep you occupied, yes but in small doses This game gets  a nice solid 8.5 based on what it does and does well, without all the BS involved with pC and more depth that Grid 2 offers:DTL:DR 8.5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unless you're a hardcore racing fan I don't recommend.The AI is too aggressive and the online multiplayer is dead.AI 'catchup' feature completely ruins the game, if the AI get's too far behind they get a stat boost to their car making them overpowered and just not fun or realistic at all.Otherwise the physics compared to GRID2 make it a completely different more realistic and fun experience, but its hard to have fun as the AI is so awful.

IntruductionI don't write much reviews, but I feel that this game needs one from me.I have followed the development of this game closely, and everything I read made me believe this was going to be a good game. So naturally I pre-ordered the game. I never have been someone who buys a DLC, though a pre-order bonus is something I usually take.First impressionFirst impression is that they did listen. This is a game with good graphics, and cars handle as they should. Not unlike in Grid 2, that if you learn how to slide in every corner, you are guaranteed going to be faster than everyone. I started doing multiplayer directly. I learned that like in every multiplayer game, the sooner you start with multiplayer, the easier it is, because you get access to the faster cars earlier. I started out doing streets discipline because that is what I loved from Grid2 most too.This worked for me. I like the cars and the tracks I drove were nice. It did seem the same tracks were in the rotational though, but on the forums they mentioned to do something about that. It immediately came to me that this game has a steep learning curve. Nothing you do will guarantee you to win and many things just don't seem to work and you have to figure out why. For that reason I wrote a beginners guide to Multiplayer with all the do's and don'ts. A lot of people are thankful to me because it answered many questions they had.If a game has this, that is not a good sign, but lets try and keep things positive. I mean, you learn how it works, and then it works.My first encounter with the AII started doing Open Wheels with a friend in custom lobbies with AI to fill up the spots. This is where I found out that CodeMasters made a big mistake with this game. The AI is badly programmed. They say they are very fond of how the AI is, and that it is very realistic. This is a lie. The AI really is AI (artificial) It follows the racingline, and if you happen to be there, they are happy to crash into you pushing you away. They'll get you to spin off the tarmac easily, and if you try that with them, they seem not to be harmed at all. They break early so you easily crash into them unless you take the inside corner and use them as a moving wall.Damage system VS AIGrid multiplayer has a damage system. Basically, when you damage your car, at the end of the race you have to repair your car which costs money. The real problem with this is that the AI does not seem to care and happily crashes into you, causing you to have a high bill to pay. There is also the impact rating that tells other drivers how clean you drive. Even if you attempt to avoid all contact, the AI easily can cause such accident that your rating becomes yellow, causing other players to think you are a bad driver.Racenet ChallengesThen there are the racenet challenges. They suffer the same problem: They included the AI in most of the races, and you start at position 12. This means that it is no longer a race to get the fastest time, but to find out how you can effectively take over 11 cars in the first 2 corners. The faster you do that, the faster your time is. Thats all there is to it really. CodeMasters has mentioned that they'll look into this, but CodeMasters also mentioned they really love the AI and are not planning to make any changes to it. Lets hope they decide to remove the AI completely.Single playerI did some single player too. I started doing Streets as that is what I did in Multiplayer too. I had to learn how to adjust to the AI. I basically learned that: crashing is good, do everything you have to do to get in front of the AI as quickly as possible trying to minimize the damage as much as possible, and you will guaranteed win. Of course, everyone else learns this too, and they take these experiences to multiplayer. Yes, this game has a lot of crashes and rammers in multiplayer too. You'll have to find custom lobbies if you want to avoid this.Good points vs Bad PointsThere are other issues too that are small problems and thus not worth having a section per item. I'll list them as good and bad points.Good points:- Good graphics- Physics of the cars are very good.- When you start a race, you get to see the map so you always know what the track is going to be like- You can enable raceline which helps greatly in learning the cars and tracks, both in SP and MP.- Most settings are shared between SP and MP.Bad points:- AI behavior vs you- AI in multiplayer vs repair costs- AI in Racenet Challenges, doesn't make sense, see above.- Keyboard players have a big disadvantage over controller players in Endurance (basically, forget this mode all together)- Big learning curve- Time spent waiting too long- MP, time before first race can easily go up to 10 minutes if you're out of luck, but on average it is 5 minutes or more)- Game says cockpit view, but it isn't really a cockpit view. No working dials, everything blurred.- Assists aren't really assists. Except for ABS, the rest makes you go slower and loose bonus points, giving a false sense of help.- Menu system is hard to navigate and reponds slow.- Quitting MP takes a lot of time, you cannot quit when you want to and have to wait for a certain moment before you can quit. ALT-F4 works, but you'll loose your progress.- Cheating happens in MP, even though CodeMasters are banning cheaters.End verdictLong story short... Grid Autosports on paper is this: the best things from Grid1 and Grid2 together. The actual outcome however isn't this. With a short development time for this game, yet a full price, it is clear the game is a quick job trying to generate money because of the negativity around Grid2.For who is this game? If you are very good at racing games and you want a bit of realism, yet you want to have a challenge, you'll love this game. If you are not very good at racing games, this game just isn't going to make you happy. Any other racing game will do it, just not this one. If you don't want too much realism in how your car drives, this game is not for you either. Grid1 might be, Grid2 definitely is going to be. If you have raced a lot in Assetto Corsa, this game is not gonna do it for you. If you race with keyboard and do not have/want to drive with a controller (gamepad or steeringwheel), this game is going to be harder for you. Can still be fun but you'll have a disadvantage in certain disciplines.If you want to get this game solely for multiplayer, I would not recommend it, because the racenet challenges are an important part of multiplayer, (gives you the most XP/money in a short timespan) and right now, the racenet challenges are crap.I hope this review helped you make a decision. I didn't made the decision lightly to write this review, but I feel I have to.			",38,4,10,1,8,1,8

												Overall:- A rushed production- If you're a GRID fan, DON'T buy it , it's not GRID 3, it's just GRID 2.5- If you're new to GRID, DON'T buy it, buy original GRID and GRID 2, they are way more better, and you won't miss any thing when you played thouse twoGood:- Overall graphic is nice- Sound is great, menu music is very good- The ""every-one-can-race"" driving style is preserved, that's good- PR team did hell of job, made me belive this will be like the original GRID, but better, so I pre-order itBad:- You need a gamepad, keyboard driving is no good(They are good when it back in orignal GIRD). I know I know, you have a steering wheel, but GRID is a fun-to-play racing game, if you try to play it as simulation game, you will dispoint.- Game design is rubbish, both singleplay and multiplay is messy- NO team management in the singleplay, you are a hried driver, you can't choose car, livery, upgraed, teammate, so I first thought maybe GRID:Autosport is focus on multiplay...boy was I wrong- Multiplay is lack of creative, finding new race is difficult, the only way I can play multiplay race is invite my friend...- The orginal GRID is great mostly becasue it's creative, back then, every race track in other racing game has only fixed time of day, so you can imange how amazing when we first saw LeMans 24 hours race in GRID with shifting time of day, and then you can understand how dispointed when you find out ""Endurance"" seriese in Autosport is just runing in a night version race track, when every major racing game has change time and weather as standard...hopelsee			",65,6,14,8,24,0,11

												It seems odd that we had to wait close to five years at an official sequel to Codemasters incredible Race Driver: Grid, and now only a year later, sitting with the series' third game. It tastes undeniably by a developer as well by the jokkede in the spinach, and therefore has worked diligently to together splitting the successor as the series' many fans had hoped for in the first place.Therefore, it is not surprising that the Grid: Autosport in style feels like an extended, graphic prettier version of the series' first game and never really manages to put his own stamp on the whole for fear of differ so radically from the original as Grid 2 did.There should not be many button presses to before is started with the first race, and actually Codemasters discarded part of the personalization that or has characterized several of their car racing. Five different race classes means that you can decide how you want to approach it all the way and is a welcome approach compared to some of the more restrictive structures you find in many of the genre's other games.Touring is the closest the new games come on the series' roots, so then Codemasters yet called the TOCA Touring Car Championship. Here it is on standardvognsræs with lots of horsepower, clashes and cars stretching from a Honda Civic to a Nissan Skyline GT-R.Endurance is a completely different size and is about ran over long distances, which means a completely different approach. If you want to see the finish line, let alone join in a proper location, so at all times make sure to treat the car properly and get the rubber of your tires to stretch as far as possible. It's a really exciting form of racing that few other games have had the courage to include and the right discipline requires that you have the concentration skills in order.Open Wheel is the game's fastest class and focuses on small, fast single-seaters, among other means of races in Ariel Atom, Dallaraa F312 and Caparo T1. If one before has been caught by developers F1 series, it is also where you will feel most at home, despite the fact that simulation trends obviously not Special focus.Street is by-race as in the first Race Driver: Grid and is definitely where the game most frequently shows its graphical muscles. It's also the closest race, and you are almost constantly surrounded by a whole field of other cars, making the class very intense.The last wild lass is Tuner, despite having its own qualities also seems like the least adequate in the game's complete package. Here is the following of ardent running competitions and time trial with everything from muscle cars to the tuner-favorites like the Mazda RX-7 and Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X.You have to take my hat off to the tremendous work Codemasters obviously put in to ensure that each of those five classes not only clearly different from each other, but also is relatively faithful to the racing classes from the real world that inspired them. If you are planning to transform yourself into the ultimate Grid cruise control, however, you can look forward to spending time in all disciplines, as it is the only way the game closes on all its content.To master race classes means that you will greatly be working to find the balance in the variety of cars and it is really encouraging to Codemasters have returned to a management that has far more in common with it from the first game than the powerslide-happy approach from Grid secondCodemasters has again orchestrated a controller that clearly lets you mark how far you can push the selected car before it goes wrong. If that kind of gets simulation alarms ringing in you, there is nothing to fear, for Grid: Autosport are just as motivated by arcade racing as its predecessors. Mixing balance is the developer's own, and again, they have hit the mark with something that works accessible, speed-filled and action-oriented without the chamber completely in Burnout territory.It is no secret that the development time on Grid: Autosport has not been very long, and despite a thoroughly solid game racing, it's something you feel in virtually all aspects of the game.The aforementioned inability from start to personalize the experience is just the first symptom of a game where there seem saved and reused in all the edges and looking where it has been possible. Most cars, tracks and race types have already been included in the series' previous edition, and the graphical difference from Grid 2 to Grid: Autosport is not enough to hide the problem.Saved there also seems to have been on the development of artificial intelligence, and Autosport offers the series' most unprofessional opponents to date most of the time does not seem to suspect that there are others on the field than themselves.Elsewhere must wonder a bit over the configuration of the various races, and even races in fast single-seaters can be boring when you are forced into a time around to run six to eight different tournaments where each race to be run twice before one again gets to choose another runaway lass.Graphic is also not much has happened lately, and though sometimes it still is impressive how many colors, effects and cars Codemasters manages to force the screen without sacrificing frame rate, it's a little disappointing that there is at least not been lavished little more for the PC version.Grid: Autosport is certainly not without talent. Whether you have played the series before or not the race is on the field still fun, intense and delivered with a really good management. However, it is without doubt those who do not have experience with the series, which will make the most of Grid: Autosport, for the rest of us will find it hard to ignore the clear taste of recycling.Thomas Blichfeldt Gamereactor Denmark			",293,83,80,28,41,7,38

												Dear fellow players. I have just bought this game recently and in my opinion it is amazing. The best thing to mention is that the game focuses on the player only, you do not have to go through a boring career method, you can freely do the events as you would like to.The game has really wide range of motorsport genres, you can find almost everything what you like, including drift, formula car series etc.The gameplay, with the RPG elements also fantastic. In online games, you will start the game with a loan vehicle, which are the slowest one. As you progress and earn money for racing, you can finally buy your first car and upgrade them through your online career. As soon as your car is leveled to the highest level, you will experience some really difficult and enjoyable races online.The online community is also good, the game has an “impact rating system”, which means if you make an impact with other players, your rating will be lowered and you will be temporarily banned from some of the events which has impact rating enabled. If you would like to improve your impact rating, you need to drive safe and look out for the other racers and stay away from impacts at all costs.The mixture of arcade and simulation style is also a good idea, it is not easy as an arcade game for example Need for speed series and it is not that difficult either. You need to have some skills, if you would like to finish in the top places, so the challenges will last long enough to play lot of hours.Only two negative thing to mention. The first is the blurry HUD, which is painfully awful. I do not even know, why codemasters did not do it perfectly (they do it right in the first GRID). Secondly, the silly AI is can be really annoying. The system did not even notice whether I am on the track or not.Altogether, a game which is really fun to play in my opinion and I will play many more hours in the future. Hopefully, the negative problems will be solved in the future through a patch or something. I am really recommend this game, if you are looking for good competition, it is an 8 out of 10 for me.I am really looking forward to see you soon in my rearview-mirror! :) ",36,2,2,5,1,0,2

												A diverse but inconsistent racer, while the graphics and easy and complete menus add to the strong side. It all comes crashing down when you actually start a race. The AI is very very dumb and this is in the realistic hard version, as a Gran Turismo Veteran, Grid's AI is not really an AI when you just feel part of a prerun race, the unresponsiveness and complete obliviousness of the AI to your every move, keeps me frustrated at how I have to adjust myself to the AI's position, yet they have no problem crashing into me EVERY time when I successfully clean overtake. I've never encountered such an unrealistic driving experience in Gran turismo, and Oh do I wish GT comes to the computer/steam platform.			",101,5,5,14,4,0,12

												I've been a fan of Codemasters since the original ""Dirt,"" enjoyed the original ""Grid"" (realizing it was arcad-y), and have loved F1 2012. I judge simulators among simulators and arcade games for what they are as well. This game was horrible. I got drunk and bought it for $40 one night. The next day, I start it... the car pivots around its center when you turn... Strange even for a less serious ""arcade"" style game. If you're into simulator style racing games, you probably aren't even looking at this franchise. If you want a fun, but less serious racing game, you should still stay away. I put three hours into it, forcing myself to enjoy, but failed. Luckily Steam refunded my money. Thank you Steam.			",46,1,5,2,4,0,0

TL;DR VERSION:GRID: Autosport is my favourite casual sim, with amazing physics (similar to GRID 1), good AI, great track selection, nice damage system, and beautiful graphics.Rating: 9/10Note: I recommend you read the in-depth review below and watch some gameplay videos!================================================================IN-DEPTH REVIEW:I'm writing this review with about 6 hours of play time logged, so keep that in mind.GRID Autosport is a great game. I has a few downfalls, but overall it is very enjoyable.Starting with the graphics/visual side, it has some great looking effects and beautiful lighting. Car models look a little on the low-detail side, but its not a very big problem.The in-car cameras, I have to say, fail. There's no working dials, and very low detail on the interiors. The mirrors don't work either. Depending on what your requirements are, this could be game breaking or just a 'meh' situation. I can live with it, because I'm not a hardcore sim player. It still needs fixing though, because sometimes it is a nice change to play inside the car.Physics wise, the game is super. It feels great with an Xbox 360 Gamepad, and absolutely jaw-droppingly amazing with a wheel (and I'm even using an old Logitech Momo wheel!). Haven't tried it with a keyboard yet. It's very accessable, but also quite deep. A very good example of 'simcade' handling, and a great improvement over GRID 2.My old Momo steering wheel worked fine first time, so thumbs up for old wheel support :)I don't know whether I like or hate the AI. I think maybe both. They are so damn agressive, it makes for some hair-raising, what-the-heck-how-did-I-pull-that-off racing, but also gets a bit rough, and can get on your nerves sometimes if you want to race clean. They'll grind and bump you quite regularly, so get used it it :)I haven't had a go at Online yet, I'll update the review when I do.Car list is good, ranging from the VW Golf, to the Bugatti Veyron and Koenigsegg (did I spell that right?) Agera. Like said before, it would be nice to have some higher quality car models, but it's not game breaking.There are a nice range of tracks, from Bathurst to the original San Francisco from GRID 1 (finally! I loved that track!).Performance is good, running it all maxed out at 1080p with a solid 60FPS on a GTX 980 Ti and i7 6700k.-------------------Pros & Cons List:Pros:+ Nice Graphics (eye candy, track detail).+ Jaw dropping handling (in my opinion).+ Supported my old Momo Force Feedback wheel.+ AI provide a good challenge, and make the races exciting+ Good car list, nice variety (all DLC included).+ Nice range of tracks (all DLC included).+ Good optimization, had no hitches getting it running.Cons:- The car models are not as high quality as I'd like (but lower quality models help with optimzation).- Interior views are lacking detail.- AI can get too rough.Overall: 9/10------------------Thanks for reading :)			",44,6,33,2,6,0,0

												In short? This has quickly become an absolute favorite of mine. If you enjoyed the first GRID, had fun with the second, or didn't play either but just like racing games, this is a fine investment. It plays relatively similarly to the first, leaning slightly more towards simulation, but is still accessible enough as long as you generally treat the cars like cars, so with the heavily adjustable difficulty and wide range of game modes, if it looks good to you, you can find something to enjoy here.The original GRID jumped around between many different racing disciplines, keeping things exciting as you could jump from open-wheel races to demolition derbies at will. GRID 2 was a more linear set of races; luckily, Autosport finds a middle-ground and divides the game into 5 main disciplines: Touring, Open-Wheel, Endurance, Tuner, and Street. Touring is basically classic bumper-to-bumper racing on circuits, Open Wheel is faster and more fragile, Endurance is night racing (in the single-player maps, at least) with time-accelerated tire wear, Tuner is a collection of extra modes like Time Attack and Drift with classic cars, and Street uses road courses and supercars. Outside of the single-player career, you can combine any car set with any tracks.There's a pretty massive selection of tracks, thanks in no small part to, well, the vast majority being ports from GRID 1 and 2. Those games' globetrotting feel was often hampered by going back to the same locations again and again within the same tours, but with (the majority of) their rosters combined, repetition happens a lot less (though still a tad often in longer seasons). Normally, I find circuit racing a bit of a bore in terms of visuals, but all the courses here are rather beautiful, and visually interesting enough to be distinguishable.I have bought a ton of racing games and played through a ton of career modes, so the structure of the single-player campaign struck me as a little odd; you're a driver for hire who picks a team contract and then works with that set of cars, sponsors, and teammates for the rest of the season, which is also a pre-set bundle of races (and between races, you can save and exit the season, returning to it later). Still, it feels pretty awesome to be the one they bring in to turn the tide; typically the contracts are from rival teams who pit you against whichever you didn't pick. In any case, these mean huge sets of events with points standings that run across them from beginning to end, which is hit-or-miss. Sometimes it's an intense battle, sometimes it just drags and you're slogging through more and more of the same thing. The GRID seasons definitely remedy this by hopping between all disciplines, but there's only three of them.The actual classic GRID 1 sort of experience - buy your cars, customize them, make paint schemes, and so on - is actually moved to the online modes, weirdly. However, you don't have to play multiplayer to make use of these. Every week, it generates six new weekly challenges, mixing and matching car classes and tracks to make unique events that breath a little new life into the game on a regular basis. As such, it's the one game I come back to every single week. It doesn't penalize you for not showing up; it's entirely optional and extremely fun.That's how I'd sum this up. Extremely fun. Despite anything else one might find fault with this, the handling is absolutely superb, the game is just forgiving enough to encourage genuine racing tactics without demolishing you for the slightest slip-up, and the massive amount of content makes absolutely no sacrifice of quality for quantity. This game makes my laptop run really, really hot, and I've gone the past few months with rather consistent burn marks on my legs because that's not gonna stop me from playing more of this. There is so, so much here that if you just want one racing game that will cover nearly everything, well... this is it. I can't recommend it enough.			",202,57,48,14,17,5,10

												Very disappointing.Not being able to create your own team, buy your own cars (like in the first Grid), had made this game meaningless. You are nothing more than a driver racing cars you neither picked nor own, for a team that's not yours. You have no stake, no affection with whatever you're doing at all. That drains away all the motivation to pick this game up and race again.And if you're saying that the racing expereince is all that matters, then I can name at least 5 other games which do that equally well, and on top of that, give you a sense of belonging to your beloved cars.

												What I've played so far, it is a great racing-simulator. Everything seems pretty realistic like physics, driving and so on. The only really arcade-like thing that I noticed is the well-known flashback function, which is helping out a lot.Personally, I like racing games with a little more to them than just racing. I'm more of an arcade racing-guy, and GRID Autosport seems to head down the simulator track this time. But if you're a fan of racing-simulators, I say go ahead. You might love this one!

												Nothing short of what i expected it to be. An amazing racing game. My only problem is that in the POV camera, it looks horrible, the interior design on the cars seem to not even be remotely textured. Other than that its very good. If I were to be honest, i dont think it could compete in the simulation/arcade, racing games such as Forza 5 or Grand Turismo. It does have its pros and cons as any game should, and its in its first release build, so its too be expected, maybe they will polish it in the future.			",63,3,3,2,4,0,10

												Change of review... (old one see bottom of this, hypocrite maybe)So, I did like this until Codemasters and a few of the devs on here mentioned they are working on a new engine. Then the placebo wore off. Then F1 2014 came out, nearly everyone complained it was a clone of 2013 and again Codemasters stated they are working on a new engine. So basically all we have here are 2 games, very similar to the last, with yet another price tag to pay.If you own 1 and 2 I would say save your money. The online mode is almost dead, the game hasn't delivered in fairness. You will still see the same cars winning above any other like the 4wd Golf etc. The crash system hasn't stopped fools having a laugh. The tracks are mostly the same, along with the darby races brought in as a ""free"" dlc (wish they brought more of Showdown into that dlc).And finally, my biggest problem, the real life physics. Disk breaks still only glow for a few second and don't ware, the handling is still too ""drifty"" and you get no sense of the car your driving from any other. Cars are all the same blah blah blah blah.Again if you buy this try and enjoy the placebo while it lasts. Otherwise wait for Project Cars this March or the next in Codemasters plans. Provided they give the new games the lift it really needs, not something that feels very very much descended from ps1's Colin Mcrae... 26th June, 2014YES YES YES! Thank you to all the team over at Codemasters! I never got early access, but read many reviews. Most good, but some talked about handling being well rubbish, wobbly, no grip. Obviously these people haven't taken a real car into a corner at 70mph. I would say its near spot on. Grid 2 I hated, you just turn full lock and floor it. This you think, you slow down and you gently turn into a corner. Just what a good racing game should be. I finally feel we are all out of this NFS arcade way of driving. Its very early days now so haven't really played the game enough to fully see how things go but one things for sure. Your not going to play online only to have one option of wining a race, Ie follow the sheep and only drive one car on each class. Just what racing games needed. I will give a better review in the coming weeks. And once again thank you!!!  ",75,11,15,7,19,0,5

												You want the truth, so here it is: I wish Steam had a stars rating system... I'd give it 3 out of 5.  This game is very good, and really is worth the purchase.  (At least until something better comes along.)Some will criticize it as being ""simcade"", harping on ""mediocre physics"", etc., and they're right that it's a simcade but not right about the physics at all.  So here's how it really is.  The physics are top notch, simulation grade.  However, great physics don't make a simulator.  True, great physics are a requirement of being a simulator, but a simulator is more than just a set of well implemented physics rules.  That is where such critics get confused: they tend to view physics and simulation as one and the same, but that's just not reality.  The handling and physics models really are quite good.  (The only aspect of physical simulation I think they could improve greatly on is the force feedback - it's good, but not great.)However, this game is a GAME, first and foremost.  What separates it from the likes of iRacing is not ""bad physics"" (again, they're quite good) but the approach to development, which is very game oriented.  For instance, many of the cars DON'T actually handle like their real world counterparts (for instance the GT-R is far more ""understeery"" than it is in real life)... however, they DO handle very much like *A* real car... just not necessarily the car being represented.  I believe the reason it is that way is because of lack of research - research I'd guess the developer didn't feel was necessary since the goal was balanced gameplay, and as long as they acheived balanced trade-offs within a given class of car, and it was approximately true to life, that was ""good enough"".  (However, in my opinion, it's NOT good enough, but I digress.)Another aspect that is very game-ish rather than simulation-ish, is the A.I. (computer driven) cars/players are extremely and frustratingly aggressive.  I read in the developer's blog how proud they were of their aggressive A.I., but I feel they missed the mark.  In real life racing, there is aggression, no doubt, but there is also a sense of caution... no pro race car driver will intentionally derail another driver into a potentially fatal crash - unless they want to be arrested for manslaughter.  Gently tapping/touching/etc. to throw another driver off their game, sure, that happens in real life (and is very controversial)... but repeated hammering until you spin out of control or completely T-boning your car is absolutely NOT realistic.  At times, Grid Autosport reminds me of the old game ""frogger"", where it feels like the point is to dodge speeding cars as you cross the road, cars that are actually trying to hit you (or at least don't care at all if they do.)  To make this worse, if you return the aggression, the A.I. cars are very difficult to disorient or make slide/spin, whereas they can feel free to derail you at will.  This is the most frustrating aspect of Grid Autosport.  To introduce this kind of A.I. logic is to add a layer of ""random chance""... a layer that is very inappropriate in a purely skill oriented venue.Frankly, I don't think that Codemasters (the developer) really understands their audience - we want the wonderful online gameplay and comradery (which is excellent by the way), great cars to drive (and they are) in an immersive and realistic environment (also quite good), but we don't want to waste our time on ""games of chance"".  Racing is a purely skill oriented discipline... there's no element of random chance whatsoever (not counting weather, which Grid Autosport doesn't have anyhow.)  We want the good aspects of ""gameplay"" with the best of simulation... because we want to believe that we're real live race car drivers... that's the illusion we want to buy when we give them our money.  This is where Codemasters really misses the mark - they don't seem to get that at all - they seem only to understand the ""rules of game design"" without considering what we the audience really, truly want: A racing simulation that keeps us immersed and believing that it’s real but gives us a sense of PROGRESSION and ACHEIVEMENT found primarily in games.  Ruining the illusion with random chance and puerile A.I. ruins the experience, and wastes our time and money.The bottom line is that the physics are excellent (if you can forgive inaccurate representations of specific cars), the graphics are excellent, online racing is outstanding, but the A.I. is horrible, frustrating, and hardly fun at all.  If it weren't for the great online gameplay, I'd say avoid this title, but on the whole, it's worth getting.			",65,1,8,5,7,0,1

												I spend almost 2500 hours in this game so I must say that Grid Autosport is a great game worth a lot of time playing.To make 2500 hours long story shorter I will simply just write down whats good and whats bad from my point of view  GOOD- great realistic racing,awesome gameplay- cars are nicely devided by classes,so whatever car you choose it is the right one and it gives you the opportunity for close racing- tuning cars is very effective,large possibility for improvement and setting the car according to your style- multiplayer is made very well,racing,leveling each discipline,leveling cars,racenet challenges,upgrades,tuning,repairs    and the whole online career is great- penalties for cutting the corner are made well and don't cause pileup crashes on multiplayer like on GRID 2- idea about racenet clubs is great- AI behavior and difficulty- great graphics,physics and car damage  BAD- worst career mode so far from a GRID series (playing just as a driver for a hire,long and boring progress,no money to spend)- some bugs that has never been fixed (racing line bug,AI stuck on multiplayer,save data corrupt which is the worst case scenario bug)- most of the tracks and cars are already seen and played in GRID 2- not enough room in multiplayer garage to have a car for every class- so-called ""riding the wall"" thing is yet again very possible- expiriance points system on multiplayer is very bad (same xp for a 1 lap or a 20 laps race)- same engine sound use 2 different cars (Ford Sierra and Lancia Delta have the same engine sound for example and some others like that)- THERES NO CORVETTE IN THE GAME!As a fan of a GRID series this game deserves a great 8.5/10 it's a great realistic racing game that most of us wanted at the first place after GRID 1,but on the other hand there is a big taste of this being just a very quick game build and a remake of GRID 2			",21,1,4,3,0,0,6

												So, after I bought this game for about 6 dollars on *steam censorship*.com, I thought about making a review about this.So, how does it drive?Actually, better than I thought. I expected some kind of GRID 2-ish handling, but it drives way more like DiRT 3 with more grip and only on ashpalt. Although it is pretty much realism-trimmed, It´s still very fun to drive, especially the Street Cars.And if you´re looking for the most realistic game of the GRID franchise, here you go.The Drift Races still suck tho.Content?Yes.How much?Very much. Most tracks are taken from GRID/GRID 2, but all of them are redone. San Francisco looks way better now. But of course there are multiple new tracks, a few city tracks and race tracks like Hockenheimring and Red Bull Ring (I think, read that somewhere)There is a huge range of cars, everything from numerous kinds of street cars, over classic japanese tuners, muscles and even damn racing trucks, to formula/indycars and touring cars.Grafficks?They exist. And it looks awesome for a game on an engine from 2006. And the difference in graphics between DiRT and GRID Autosport is like the difference between Battlefield BC and Battlefield 4.ayy lmao, dis no sim racur, dis no hev weel optiuns.You´re right, except you´re wrong. Codie´s fixed that in the meanwhile and if you got a Force Feedback Wheel, please try this, this is so much fun with a FFB Wheel.Multiplayer?Exists too. Haven´t tried it yet though.Overpriced?Actually not at all. GRID 2 is overpriced, I won´t pay 30 bucks for Tokyo Drift Simulator. But for the content this is actually wellpriced. Wouldn´t buy the DLCs though, not a fan of them anyway.Cockpit view?Yeeeeahhh-no. Something weird. You have a Dashcam and a normal Cockpit Cam, but the dash in Cockpit Cam is all blurred out for you, so you can´t see that Codemasters didn´t put an HQ Cockpit in your car or even the dials don´t work.Story?noone cares m8The End?Yes. Overall this is a Wellpriced, good looking, well drivable Racing Simulator. Get it. And if you´re a ch33ky♥♥♥♥♥n199a like me who doesn´t want to pay 40 bucks for a game, get it on *steam censorship* or *steam censorship* for way less money. Whatever it costs below 40 bucks, it´s worth it. Get it. NOW!			",136,7,33,3,5,1,5

												Do yourself a favor and buy Grid 1. This Grid:Autosport has a very sh*tty handling, VERY poor sense of speed, the cockpit view is blured like it' 1998. Sound of the cars is crap too. The sense of speed is so bad, I take a E92 M3 , corner it and 99% times I think that my car fully stopped (it's moving so slow) and the tacho shows 98 km/h. Race driver GRID (GRID 1) was an amazing racer. I still play it rather then this one. Better handling, better sounds, better cockpit .It's a shame, Codemasters had such a great franchise with Grid 1, Grid 2 was also bad, and now this one..			",49,2,9,11,1,0,1

												By far the best value in PC Arcade racers today. While games like Assetto Corsa and Project Cars concentrate on realizm and driving simulator game play, Grid Autosport balances nicely between Arcade and Sim racers. Course designs are easily familiar to the real world courses and course diversity is average. Custom Skins and the abilty to make groups is great but the online multiplayer sessions can be a bit confusing at times when you are trying to meet up with a buddy due in part to the cumbersome RaceNet interface which differs from regular online play.  The stoyline, while lengthy and appears to be full of diverse content, ultimately forces a driver to be all things to all forms of racing, which si not something that actually happens in the racing world. Graphics are 9/10, Audio is 9/10, Controls support 9/10 and content 8/10 (just because I am not into all the tuner and drift stuff). Overall I rate the game 85-90 out of 100 in total game ranking & is worth the on sale price.			",430,56,40,38,43,2,44

Only buy if you play Singleplayer or have a set of friends to play with in Multiplayer.I bought the game at its release and this is what's negative about it:CONS- Codemasters community manager repeatedly claimed that they would constantly improve and patch the game for at least a year after its release. He blatantly lied. - Online play is pretty much dead, you have to switch your Steam download region to UK to be able to find some players- Cheaters in multiplayer matches, cheats which their anticheat can't detect and exist since the release, the kind of cheats which slightly increase your grip or acceleration so beginners think their cars just have better upgrades. - Driving and body physics are fairly arcade-like and unpredictable at times, some cars feel clumsy, e.g. with a keyboard you can't corner as good as a gamepad driver due to steering angle problemsFor me personally it's an improvment towards GRID 2 but still a step backwards compared to GRID 1. So overall it's playable but still a disappointment.I recommend buying ""Forza Horizon 3"" instead.			",132,7,4,7,6,1,5

												I bought this game thinking it would be completely different than the other games in the GRID series. The ""authentic handling"" as stated in the description caught my eye as GRID 2 was all about drifting every single car around corners at crazy speeds. I was very disappointed to learn that nothing has changed. This game feels like GRID 2 with better graphics, the same drifty handling, and the same waste of money for someone looking for a, ""authentic handling"" or simulator experience. This brings me to the controls, I'm sure the game is manageable with a controller or even a keyboard and mouse, but with a wheel like a G27, good luck. The shifting, should you choose to use a manual transmission with a clutch and H shifter is horrid, cars pop out of gear at random times and most of the time you can't put the car back into gear because the game simply won’t recognize it. All in all, the game isn't what I was looking for and Codemasters has only given the series a new set of pretty textures and not much else. If you liked the other GRID games, by all means this is nothing different but if your someone looking for a sim experience I recommend you look into Race 07, and Asseto Corsa and not dump $50 on this game like I did.

75/100Pretty fun racing game!  I expected it to be more realistic when it comes to car handling, but it is in fact quite arcady and a bit loose. I am playing with a Xbox controller and the controls are not super responsive and direct when it comes to the steering with the L joystick, but it's acceptable. You might need to get used to it a bit in the beginning, after that it's fine.The game has a ton of cups and challenges to keep you busy for many many hours (enough content). Even with the arcady feel it is actually quite chalenging to drive against the AI! So far as I have played the amount of different tracks is quite low, I played for 7 hours and only driven half a dozen different tracks (and reversed), also the amount of different cars and classes is quite low. One really noticable quality gap in the game is the cockpit view. It is really low detailed in most/all cars and they made the cockpit on the lower part of your screen blurry to camouflage it. It is extra noticable, because basically everything else in the game is pretty solid and good quality. As for realism I think this game falls far below the racing sims on the market. Even Gran Turismo feels more real (direct/responsive) when it comes to car handling, but the AI in GRID is way more fun to race against and the races are more custimizable then in Gran Turismo. I also don't think that this game tries or was intended to be a realistic racing sim, but an enjoyable not over complicated racing experience. And that it does quite well. Overall I think this is a pretty solid and fun racing game and worthy to pick up during a sale.			",148,11,15,23,22,1,29

												Having over 600 hours in this game, having a lot of fun racing, having completed all achievements;I do not recommend this game!Here are the simple reasons why:A.I. online driver system is broken: It happens in online racing that A.I. drivers will not show up on the starting grid, or never leave at the start of the race. This results in them never finishing that race and all players being stuck in a lobby, having to reset the game.My savegame got corruptedSteam Cloud my♥♥♥♥♥(and i'm fairly confident that VAC is also falsely advertised). Anyway i lost my complete carreer, all my cars, all my cash. Which brings me to my next two:Chunks of money vapor from your bankaccount.Leveling system in cars. May have seemed like a good idea, but with this small community it's simply impossible to level max some cars. I'm not a fan. (Cheatengine helps here, ""c'mon Codies, don't ban me for this, you forced this upon me."")Keyboard input randomly stops for a splitsecond! Yes i am a keyboard racedriver, sorry... But seriously on random moments in a race my car will go straight on while already cornering and tapping my keys, they suddenly don't register anymore. Not cool at all and conciderably gamebreaking! Especcially uncool when it causes me to crash another racer offtrack. And NO it's not a hardware failure, i've had this on different systems and keyboards and heard others experiencing this. (sidenote, aside for this bug the controlabilty of the cars through keyboard is great!! no controler or wheel needed)Garage limitation. There is not enough room in the garage to buy a racecar for every racing class. There is DLC available for €7.- !!! to expand your garage with just 5 slots, still not enough to have a racecar in every class. Shamefull! I would even prefer to have 2 owned cars in some classes..Still.... bearing through all this, i DO ENJOY PLAYING THIS GAME, a lot! It's a great and fun racing game, looks great feels great plays great, a nice community, friendly fair, but unfortunatly thinning out. Don't be too surprised when there is no one to race against at 3.00 am on a weekday. Check the playercount yourselves, here: http://steamcharts.com/search/?q=grid+autosportConcidering all this, can i fully recommend this? No.  Will i myself buy the next Grid game? Likely yes, on a sale. If it has good reviews,Tip for the Codies: Your game installments could do well with a replay system of online races, like .demo files. Allowing your racers to capture races from playback. I.m.o. there is no better promotion than good YouTube coverage of your game.I would have uploaded tons of races if a had an option to watch and record a replay later.			",92,12,3,5,6,0,3

												The game looks very pretty, but the physics are just wrong..  If you are looking for an arcade game then this one is not bad.  But if you are looking for a sim to get on par with iRacing / Asseto Corsa/ RF2 Then look elsewhere.  The game's AI is pretty bland and dumb. and the controlls expecially the steering just feels wrong.  and the interface could use a drastic overhaul.The nice thing about this is they have an option to place a spectator view on a 2nd display which i think is great, however expect it to pretty much kill any system using that option.

												After Grid 2, I felt there was a lot of good things to be made in the next instalment in the GRID series and I was happy to find out that many were improved. I have invested easily twice the time when comparing to GRID 2 and there was a reason for this. The multi-disciplined Events offer you a lot more variety and it's great for those who are a fan of mixing different race styles. From Endurance races to Tuner and Street you also have Touring Events and Open Wheel as well giving you different tastes of what's available in the racing words. For me all were great aside of any Drift events. It's nothing personal but I love to race in all sorts of classes but when it comes to win by points in a corner by making good use of your handbrake the racer fan in me feels a bit bored. As you advance in all events you will get a chance of having better sponsors interested in you with more difficulty and challenging objectives to complete such beating a rival time, finish above 5th place, then 3rd place and so on.There is a clear effort in making this game a pleasant experience for the racing fans but even after so many efforts there is still much to be done. Endurance races are great but it lacks some proper tuning and the duration of most of them are not really what I would call endurance since the bigger ones are around 12 minutes long. Qualifications are back and it's a great opportunity to set a time to start on a better position. The audio is the best effort I've seen in the grid series. You really do not need any soundtrack or any other sound effect. You just need to remove all the hud in the game, increase the volume and you will have such a good time driving while pushing to the max to the next gear. There are also little things that did not go unnoticed. For instance, you can ask (with the D-pad) what is the current state of your car (gearbox, engine damage, etc) as well the position of your rival, team-mate and so on. If you are entering a tunnel and you ask for this info you can see there's a difference in the sound from the speaker since the signal may be weaker. These little things are always appreciated. One last thing regarding the sound: I loved GRID 2 main theme and it's a such a shame that I felt a downgrade regarding the tunes/themes in the menus (not to mention these menus are quite... bland). Then there are the community feedback that Codemasters did or tried to achieve with things like the Cockpit view. For many racing fans this view not only is a must but it's also the only view they play their racing games. So, in order to keep fans happy Codemasters implemented this view but to be honest this was the most poor effort I've seen in adding something that is a big request in these games. First I thought that my eyes were deceiving me because I've played and seen many recent games with great looking cockpit views like Driveclub and Project Cars so it crossed my mind I was not being fair to GRID Autosport since this game was released some time ago. Then I just remembered. Games like Dirt 2 or Dirt 3 do have a cockpit view and they are quite nicely done, if you ask me. So what happened here? Was no time to develop a better view and they just tried a quick solution? For those who haven't seen it, go check it out. It's a dark, blurry mess with no details at all. Seriously. This was such a wasted opportunity and I can see why so many fans were upset with all this.One thing I also liked was the Cups between the major events. This would be races without a team member and they had a great selection of either prototypes or older gems, something I'm fond of. But still, I wish I could have seen more of them.In the end, I had great fun with Autosport. I played more than 50 hours, I did more than 400 races, leveled up every single category to level 10 or above and finished all the major events, all cups with many qualifications as well. Side Curiosity: It is thanks to Ben Gouldstone, the Senior Game Designer of Driveclub that the racetrack from Algarve, in Portugal is a reality after he gave this feedback to the Codemasters team. It's great to see when companies are open to all sorts of feedback in order to bring more variety and content to their games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best experince for me on the road with super cars!Graphics are great even at medium settings, expect for the blurry cockpit view, but all the others are fine to me, and the game runs fine and stable even on onboard graphic cards like the Intel HD ones.Cars and the enviroment looks great, so detailed that i can see the the reflection on the car easily (medium settings).Great combination between arcade racing game and simulation racing game, not too easy to steer like Need for Speed, but also not too hard like F1 games, this will make lots of gamer happy, specially casual gamersDrive on 5 disciplines with many cars, so thrilling and exciting, test your driving skills at all 5 of them.10 teams, racing at the GRID Lengends series, join one of them and lead that team to victory, great move Codemaster =))The AI are a little more agressive than GRID 2, they will try to smash your car, try to make you out of the race, be careful! One things i don't like is the Multiplayer, still reigon lock, still no world wide multiplayer, still have to change download reigon to UK before playing the multiplayer, that really annoys me when i download a new game, have to change back to my country to download it, even though the multiplayer is good, you can join a team and race with them. That really interested me =))The game is great, if you're fan or would lilke to play simulation racing game (not too hard, for casual players), you should buy it.

												So yeah, another GRID game. Please note that my opinion is based on Linux version' experience.A bunch content from older Codemasters games. Apart from visuals and other whistles and bells, I feel that circuits like Istanbul Park or Hockenheimring haven't changes at all, for worse, and more importantly, better. They are just the same.Graphics are nice, although I suspect that Linux port lacks few effects. Handling is not arcade-like, but still makes you think sometimes that first GRID back in 2007 was more realistic. But the only REAL issue is that this will be probably another Codemasters' racing game you'll never beat -- there's so much old content that you'll probably get bored halfway.Nevertheless, thumbs up. There's very few racing games on Linux whatsoever, and this is definitely not a bad one.			",100,17,9,13,14,0,15

												Pros:Great sense of speed when driving (most important thing in a racing game)Large variety in gameplay modes even without the DLCGreat career mode loaded with car variety, race/event variety, sponsors and splintering objectivesOnline challenges even without a present online communityGreat graphicsCustom tailored difficultyCosmetic car damage including option to affect vehicle performanceFlashback option allowing for rewinds to retry certain moments as opposed to restarting an entire race (newbie friendly)Cons:Driver side view isn't in HD. Blurry, none of the meters work. Extremely limiting in viewRavenwest Team (Developer's team) is unagonizingly cheapPolarizing AI. Can create distance in some races, impossible to shake off in others (rubberband AI)Certain AI race on a track and will not stop even when you block them causing them to just railroad youOverall a great racing game with a varied career mode, great graphics, great style all around. Cars look gorgeous, races are intense and game is just fun overall.			",390,73,18,49,32,4,63

												This game is amazing if you like racing games, if you notice, all the bad reviews are from people with less than 2 hours of playing, and wanted an easy racing game, i honestly don't like the endurance races, but the rest is awsome, and every car feels diferent, and no, it's not like driving on ice, if you have a driver license, and drive a car daily, you will know the game physics are almost on point compared to real life.In my opinion, GRID Autosport took the best of the original GRID and made ir better, the only let down i had, was not being able to choose the teammate, because the one you are given, normaly suck, and the fact we cannot buy cars.But on the other hand, in online mode, we can buy/sell cars, and have alot of fun with other racers, so enjoy! :)			",48,0,1,6,5,1,4

												This is one of those ""rare"" PC games that can be discribed as ""done."". Hard to find these days.GRID Autosports is a content filled but not overburdened racer with various types of cars, tracks and gameplay.It runs smooth at rock solid 60 fps with no stuttering or hickup, even on mid class rigs and... it... just makes a lot of fun to play. ;) Slick menus, wonderful graphics and believable car physics with good headroom to dig into and master every aspect of the ideal racing line. If you like racing games done with passion and have a heart for devs that still take the pc serious: grab your copy now! ;)			",248,24,9,16,30,0,24

												Be aware that the reinstatement of the cockpit cam is not as excellent as it first sounds.  It's blurry, very very blurry.  Playing with hud off.  Clearly the steering wheels in the open wheel cars are designed to have info on them such has shift lights, speedometers or whatever.  But instead its a blurry mess with no useful information.  It wouldnt be so bad if the lights on my G27 were supported.Fix it codemasters. Not in a special DCL, not with a community mod, and you can have your positive review.This will make me think twice before buying F1 2014 which I was looking foreward to.			",137,16,12,7,16,0,30

												GRID Autosport is a racing game released by Codemasters in 2014. Similar to the Colin McRae Rally games, GRID Autosport takes us to the world of professional racing, on a variety of authentic tracks, with real cars from around the world. Not exactly a driving simulator, more like a racing career simulator, as you get sponsors, achieve objectives. I compare all racing games to Gran Turismo 2, which is arguably one of the best racing/driving sims ever made, and GRID Autosport does a good job of trying to live up to such high standards. Unfortunately, I found the lack of individual car customization to be a disappointment, and I wish that you could buy cars as you win races and earn money. This isn't the case however, as  you earn reputation and experience, instead of cash, for winning. Still a great game, lovely detail, the tracks are challenging, the AI is competitive, I think racing fans will enjoy this game.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												Despite the claim that the save game corruption bug was fixed, it is still there. So be prepared to lose all of the hours of gameplay you spent randomly at any given time.Happened to me, and my friend i was playing it with, within the same weekend. For a game where so much of it is based on your levels and progress, that is for sure a total mood killer!			",216,32,3,59,35,0,74

												One of the few realistic racing games compatible with Linux, GRID Autosport is a decent racing game. The AI is quite intense even on 'easy' difficulty, but the challenges are rewarding and the controls are quite responsive and intuitive. The small selection of maps can get somewhat repetitive however, but the online races make up for this. 7/10			",50,6,1,6,6,0,6

												For some reason everyone seems to be following the Forza ""smooth loading screen"" especially for racing games. I'm also not extremely well versed in the GRID series so I don't have any comparison reviews here. This is a ""hey look what I got for free with my GPU"" review. GRID visually is stunning. I like it, I like the fact I can race about any car (especially F1 cars). Maybe it's because I'm playing on a keyboard, the steering seems a bit stiff. Tried switching to a gamepad and still sort of found it the same. The campaign itself is nice, gratifying as you go along upgrading the car you drive or buying another. There is also a feature where if you messed up royally on a turn you can hit ""rewind"" and go back before the turn.GRID is simply another racing game to be honest. The graphics are unbelievable but so are many other racing games. The driving sort of feels arcade to me. Does it mean GRID is a bad game? Not necessarily no. But I wouldn't say it's worth $50.00. I would give it an 8 but it's another racing game in my eyes. I would recommend Need For Speed Shift 2 over this. Shift literally feels like your driving a car. Overall : 7/10Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B+ Sounds / Music B+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

												GRID Autosport is a good game... but it's not a racing sim. Not even close to being one. Handling certainly is more natural and realistic than in GRID 2 (in which drifting somehow gained you more momentum out of corners), but it's still pretty arcady. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but since this game was advertised as more sim-like racing game, I wanted to clarify, that it's not really true. It's still a good game though, if you don't mind somewhat ""floaty"" handling model (typical to all Codemasters games). AI is kinda fun to drive against, although they tend to ignore any clean driving rules, so you need to get used to that.Although to be honest, I wouldn't buy it for full price - definitely wait for a sale, hopefully GRID 3 will be better.Pros:+ Okay optimisation+ Well structured career mode+ On-demand radio communication+ Overall nice sensation of speed+ It's fun, yet somewhat challenging+ Dem nightrace graphicsCons:- Blurry cockpits- Races lack some depth, no pit stops, no weather changes, etc.- Seriously, no actual mirrors on cars in racing game from 2014?- AI is reckless, especially in first lap, flashback is a must on higher difficulty levels- Annoying control bug - sometimes I just lose throttle or steering wheel for no reason- Just handful of actual tracks (somewhat compensated by many variations of one circuit)- Multiplayer is almost dead by now (August 2015)			",93,12,4,6,4,1,9

												Well, what can i say?  I thought this maybe a return to the excellent days of TOCA but I was sadly mistaken.  If you are a fan of race sims and use a wheel then I'm afraid this game is a waste of money.  In single player mode the AI just smash the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you and it's even worse online.  The game is infested with joypad players who are just zig zagging all over the track and don't seem to realise that the idea of the game is to try and pass you fair and square.  However, what your sadly presented with is a community full of ""smash to pass"" players who don't seem to have any grasp of the words ""Gentlemanly Behaviour"".  I've done several online races now and there doesn't seem to be any penalties for contact but theres plenty of penalties for clipping a corner a SMALL degree (With two tyres still on the tarmac and inside the white line).  I'm sorry but this is just another GRID with the same old churned up♥♥♥♥♥♥♥with additional cars and tracks (Most of which have been produced for their other games such as  the F1 series) which has been produced for the chavvy masses to smash the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of each other.  Oh, the graphics are excellent but the interior views are all blurred out as they couldn't be arsed to go into detail....another♥♥♥♥♥♥part of this extremely poor game.   4/10 -  I've had more fun having teeth pulled out.

												I bought this game for the multiplayer games.That's the biggest mistake I made.The multiplayer is dead.No one plays it and you'll have to change your download region to UK in order to find matches.That's ridiculous.I think it's better if you wait for a little while until this game gets more popular if you wanna buy it.I wasn't really interested in the single player games,though.So I only played the single player for the first 2 races.To be honest,I'm not really worth it to not recommend this game since I only played for 1 hour.It's just totally disappointing that no one plays the multiplayer because my main reason for purchasing steam games was for the multiplayer expierence.And about the game's content,I'll say the overall is really great.Stunning graphics,cool cars,and the engine sound makes you wanna drive more and more.But with the dead multiplayer,I lost my whole interest in this game.

												If you like the type of a game where you want to throw your pad at the wall out of anger and then pick it up 2 mins later to continue playing this might be perfect for you.TL;DRIf you plan to get the game for some single player racing - don'tIf you plan to get the game for some multi player racing - don'tUnless you are a fan of GRID games and can get it for like 5$ max, you can buy it if you want to.Good things:1. Graphics and optimisation The game looks really nice, even compared to new games and it's so well optimised that a decent pc can run it at medium-high or high settings with 60+fps. Night races are good looking and occasional eye catchers like jets or baloons are a nice thing.2. Driving modelIt's not a simulator, but still, driving model is very nice and somehow addicting, it's just fun driving in this game.3. Multiplayer part 1If you can get few friends to play with you, the game can be really fun.Meh things:1. SoundsSound is okay-ish, cars sound good, there is also some music. Nothing too impressive, but not bad either.2. Career modeAt the beginning it's fun, but after some time it gets so boring and repetitive you completely space out when you want to do it. For the occasional races it's much better to create your own cup.3. Amount of carsWell, there are many known cars, both old and new ones, but still, feels like more wouldn't hurt and well...who wouldn't want more cars?4. RacenetSometimes connecting to racenet takes a while - it's not a super long time, but still few seconds. It can be annoying when you have to do it multiple times.Bad things:1. AIPeople responsible for creating AI for this game should be tied to a pole and hit with rotten tomatoes for every ruined race. The AI is just made to irritate the player as much as possible, it's the cause of failing like 80 out of 100 races. They block your line on purpose, won't let you pass on straights unless the track is wide, block you on the corners while they're slow as snails, block the hell out of the road on first corners, brake early, sometimes they crash with each other and they even ram you off the road. They feel like they have only two states - either you don't exist for them on the track, or you do, but they are so agressive it's ridiculous. Driving among them feels like defusing 5 bombs at the same time - you never know which one will do what. They can easily do the pit maneuver on you, but if you try to ram them out of anger, their cars behave like they weight at least 4 tons. It's worth noting that if you manage to pass an AI car, they seem to slow down. They also don't get any penalties...oh those penalties...2. Penalties So what about the remaining 20 out of 100 causes of faling the races? 6 of them are crashing the car or going off the track by yourself and ridiculous penalties you get for cutting the track are the other 14.Sure, there definitely should be a way to punish the player for cutting the track, but the system in this game...it's crap.Penalties slow you down to 50 km/h for a short duration, which is decided by how much you've cut the track...well that's all in theory, in practice you get 5 seconds of penalty for slightly-yet-completely-acceptable cutting when you go over the white line by few centimenters or sometimes even not go over it at all. That type of penalty completely ruins your lap or race and all the fun in trying to get the best time as possible by creating the fastest racing line by yourself. This penalty system was a failure from the very beginning, sadly there's nothing that can be done about it. A simple time penalty PROPERLY calculated would be much better.3. Weekly challengesWhile they are a good way to earn money in the game, it's extremely frustrating. In theory you can compete with other players in the world for the best time while getting paid for it - sounds nice? BAM, in reality you get the two problems from above and sometimes some ridiculous requirements for platinum. I'm 99% sure nobody checks if those times are possible to beat, just some AI(ugh) system sets it. I'm not the best driver there is, but good enough to be really fast with practice, and sometimes even when you practice one challenge over and over and over again until there's nothing that can be improved, you're still not getting that platinum. Weird thing is sometimes it's so easy to get platinum you can get it on the first try, even with some racing errors.4. Multiplayer part 2Well. we know how multiplayer racing games are - there are many good, clean racers and also there are the ones that crash other players and ruin the fun - this game is no different. Who knows, maybe those crashers are people who got angry at the AI? You can kick crashers if they get enough votes to kick...yeah, ""if"" is the keyword.There is voice chat, which people with always-on-and-over-sensitive microphones love. You can mute them, no problem, but only if you're in the lobby before the race. Yep, even while you've crashed or abandoned the race, all you can do is listen to whiny comments or weird music or some other sounds.There is no text chat, which should be available in a pc game, but when you think about it - maybe it's better you don't have to read about who did what with your mother, but then again, they can crash into you instead, so I don't know really.There is also a small problem with lags. Sometimes you will get pushed out of the track and the other person might not even know about it and vice versa. The only solution to this is to keep a safe distance. And while we talk about multiplayer races...5. ""Rewards"" from racing......or rather lack of them. If you are racing in an expensive rental car, it won't matter if you finish 1st or 8th - you won't earn anything, instead you lose money for repairs after every race. I call it investing in the races to get better and have a laugh about it, but really I'm laughing through tears.So in the end very few pros and many cons. Shame really, this game had potential to be really fun, but too many things are just bad. I wouldn't recommend buying it, there are so many better alternatives.			",31,0,14,5,4,0,4

												There seem to be many negative reviews of this game mostly by people who have tired it for 5 mins and found that unlike Need for Speed and other driving games aimed at children and the feeble-minded, there is a learning curve.. you need to MAKE AN EFFORT.. you cannot drive GRID autosport and watch TV or text.. you need to concentrate and get the feel of the vehicles etc.. which is actually very realistic and rewarding and just about the best intuitive and responsive car handling that there is in ANY PC driving game currently available. If you want to slam in to all the barriers and hit everything but not lose speed this is not the game for you.. go play My Little Pony or some other empty pointless rubbish which is suited to you.Some people (beginners) told me that GRID autosport is not accessible , what they mean is 'not totally and effortlessly easy'... why bother to walk and talk.. did you learn that instantly??Single player mode is VERY CRAPPY and boring.. but who cares because the real action is online multiplayer where you can race others and create/host your own sessions with your choice of settings, cars and tracksDO NOT pay attention to the negative reviewers who speak more of themselves than of the game.Try it for yourself and you will see GRID autosport is quite simply one of the BEST driving games currently available.. one of the best EVER (so far)GRID Autosport is an excellent arcade racer with superb vehicle handling, an intuitive and very responsive fun racer from Touring Cars to Open Wheel, there's something to please everyone... except feeble-minded My Little Pony lamers.. and sad losers who are used to having everything done for them and mummy holding their hands.. oh there there little baby did the nasty game make you angry.. mummy will kiss it better.

												Grid Autosport brings more dreadful physics to the Grid experience where Racing Cars cannot steer around bends at 40mph without sliding into barriers. The whole game is just a continuation of the abysmal physics from Grid 2. Cars with zero grip on dry roads at low speeds, handling that's indistinct and floaty.Just stop now Codemasters. Really just stop. You made one good Grid game, the first one. I would recommend that to anyone who will listen.Grid Autosport and Grid 2 should be avoided like the plague. Fortunately I received this game free. I'd be furious if I'd have had to pay for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Changed my headlight fluid, won at life.""  TEN'AH'TA'TEN! - BuckfugglyGamingGrid has and continues to be less of a simulation fans racing game for the sake of being more of an arcade racing game. And it does what it does as well if not better than it ever has before in Grid:Autosport. That being said, there is precious little telemetry and car customization and you're given little to no selection for what you'll be driving from one race to the next. And I hate that, I'm a sim-racing fan more than anything else. But I've enjoyed my time in Grid:Autosport for sure. You won't find bespoke graphical / mechanical car customization and selection in Grid, but  you will find lots of solid arcade (think ridge racer) fun.The HD textures (while perhaps one of my favorite optional free DLC offerings from devs of any game) causes what appears to be memory-leak crashes for me but the game is pretty enough in high-res mode for me to be fine without it. As for other visuals, I feel much more like I'm racing in particular cars than I have in other games, hatchbacks typically have some weighty body-roll thats ideal to pre-load going into a corner, and high-strung sports cars feel like their ""twitch"" is pushing your head around like it owes this game money.I have a few minor problems with the audio, but they're minor and can be completely overlooked unless you really care to hear them. The team radio announcer is a little bland most of the time and a bit uninformative. But I like the idea of having radio-comms to coordinate car condition and situational performance. I'd especially like it if more games swapped out some selectable or even voice activated voice checks for the typical HUD items that tend to litter most racing games.Split screen!!! Thank you! I wish more games tried a little harder to put/keep this in their PC games. I like online gaming, but few things are as satisfying as sitting next to the person you're stomping into a dirty mudhole on the track =)I really like the idea of a youtube button during replays for uploading them to youtube. A wonderful addition to a very pretty and exciting racing experience. And it has been pretty user-friendly (as far as reply controls go) for me to capture some decent footage for machinima things I do in my spare time. But the manually selectable camera angles are limited to the same ones you have access to during the race. So that could have maybe been better. Note* - the automated cinematic camera angles are on a loop, so if you're trying to get footage, it's easy to accidentally repeat the same exact camera angles over multiple takes.I've had zero problems using my cheapo (but heaven-sent) logitech gamepad with analog triggers with no in-game setup at all. Right outta the gate everything worked flawlessly. There's a lot to be said for that.I can't speak for the online play yet. But if I get around to giving it a shot I'll sure update my review accordingly.			",245,49,20,30,41,5,60

												Oh, Codemasters. I came into Autosport expecting nothing and I was still let down. Where do I start?The GOOD:-Nice overall detail-Tons of arcade(ish) fun!The BAD:-Horrible stutter-Floaty physics-Lackluster AIThe REVIEW:Being a longtime fan of Codemasters and their work (pre DiRT 2), I thought I'd give Autosport a try. I'd seen the horrible reviews that Grid 2 had recieved, and was quite disapointed, as I loved Grid 1. Luckily, I caught Autosport on a nice sale, and was quick to ignore the shoddy reviews because I'd caught it at such a steal. Boy, had I wished I listened. Oddly enough, Autosport proved itself fun in the start. While it presented itself as a hardcore racer for hardcore players, I was lied to, as Autosport's racing physics are at best arcadey, and at worst, unbearable. All cars felt like they handled the same- all that was changed was how much power they were capable of producing. Drifting F1 cars should not be possible.On top of that, the video stutter made a playable game unplayable. I've looked into this and have found that I'm not the only one with a stuttering problem. I've tried many fixes, but to no avail. The stutter comes and goes, however. Codemasters, why advertise a game as a hardcore sim when it's not even close?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I do recommend Grid Autosport with a few hesitations. The graphics are stunning, the car models are great and the game is for the most part very well optimized for most mid to high end systems. The controls are very well executed, they feel smooth and responsive. Unless you're a hardcore racing purest I'd say pass this one up since you have no ability to choose and customize your own vehicle, they're preselected for you based on the sponsor you choose before entering into a season. The other part that bothered me significantly is that when you are leading a race your opponents appear to gain a significant speed boost and they easily overtake you and speed off into the distance as if you're standing still. The only way to midigate this issue is to turn down AI difficult which will actually impact the amount of xp you earn. If buying through steam I highly discourage it since Grid Autosport is not worth $40+ instead pick it up cheap on sites like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥etc then I recommend it as a fun and addicting time sink for a few days until you grow tired of it.

												Great game overall. THe only thing i can think of that sucks is when you join a multiplayer game you have to wait till the game ends to do anyting, you cant watch the action to pass the time (and see what the potential competion is like).Tracks are good (add ons make it even better) - overall one of the best driving games i have purchaed The list is...GP LegendsGTRGTR2GTR EvolutionRace 07SimRacewayRichard Burns RallyCMR 2,3,4,5Grid 1, 2 and this..DIrt 1,2,3 (showdown sucked for me- it wouldn't recognize a logitec g27 wheel)F1 2010,2011,2012,2013Shift 2(and a few others that i cant remember)It would be nice if there were more players online, but the Racenet Series where you race against your friends asyncronously is a realy bonus.. It still feels like multi player, but you just are not racing at exactly the same time. You are posting times that your friends compete against.Overall though- well worth the money! Driving these cars is like the real thing (i drive a WRX) HAVE FUN - RACE HARD			",18,8,12,7,1,0,2

												Positives about the game:-So many cars so many track options, catergories like touring open wheel etc. contain a lot of cups opportunities to race on, and to level up both online and offline.-You can race, have a time attack or have checkpoint or eliminator races and also u have demilition derby, and of course drift events (there are dls which can give u something like drag racing too)Racenet challanges are rewarding, if u are in the top 30% of the leaderboards u can get like 45000 ingame money and by participating in one u can even level up.-You can make your own liveries which for me is a massive plus point with sponsors and what not, and the bigger money u have the better sponsors u can put on, which will earn you little amount of money after a multiplayer race.-Level system. in both career and online but especially online I like it, because we can sort of have an idea on who put a lot of effort into the game and good at the game and probably has upgraded veichles and who is someone with like 1 or 2 hours with level 1, in f1 games u have no idea about stuff like that until u go into the session. - Speaking of upgraded veichles, u can upgrade tune and as I said make your own livery for a veichle you own online, the more you race with it the bigger level it gets, for example after level 5 of ur car the brake bias tuning gets avaliable and etc u will get upgrades too which will make the can better as  I said. the biggest upgrade is at level 50-impact ratings: have u noticed in an online race there is a circle with a '!"" in it. know what that means? that shows the impact rating of a certain player I like that cause, for example if I see someone with an orange  I will try and be aware as it means that he is likely to crash into me, and white is ""super clean""- Difficulty bonus. in every mode u race in pretty much (there are exceptions) u will get difficulty bonus depending on how challenging u choose to race. for example lets say u are on 38% bonus with 3 flashbacks, now if u put them to unlimited it will be lower, by a lot actually, and the whole bonus will be based on how u choose to race, without tc abs or force inside camera and stuff like that - This game rewards you for putting the time into it and experience, as u need to build up your progress to higher levels in order to reach like sponsors or for example garage slots.- Damage model is cool, the car deformates in many ways- The game looks beautiful despite me having a bad equipment- Racenet clubs. u can make a group where ur friends join, and u can put on a custom livery for that club, u dont have to make a livery for every car, u can just quickly choose that livery and go with it (of course if u dont have time or don't want to make a livery)---Open for updates, I can update this review later---Slight negatives (these negatives don't make me hate the game but they can be annoying)AI- They sometimes have no respect to you they push you off track and in some cases crash into you that u get damage, I reccomend u to be careful in every mode with damage on also have like 1-3 flashbacks.- During online if u have a loan veichle, after a race u get ridicolous amounts of damage expences sometimes even after winning, like -8000 d.e. and like 3000 for everything else, its just not cool, and unfortunetaly I can't own every veichle on a low level obviously.- You can only race RavenWest in carrer after u won that season u can't start a new season with it which is a shame- Engineer speaking skills :D u are in practise in career u completed one lap.. now u are up in the 1st sector by 2.3 seconds and even improving in the second one and the engineer....: ""You are on avarage pace through sector 1"" ""...... avarage pace through sector 2"" ""....avarage pace through sector 3.""  I am like you are an avarage engineer lol xD.Also I improve a lap and he says ""you lost a bit of pace in that lap lets pick it up"" I am like, you blind ::::::: I improved by a second how is that losing pace :D but its more like facepalm than making me angry.- Distance of races online and offline make no difference, so a 12 lap race isnt worth more xp than a 2 lap this one isnt a negative or a postive: handling.. it is generally quite oversteery, especially open wheel but for example cat c touring has no wheelspin even with tc off (well not no but you know). In the past I didnt play the game cause of the handling but now I got used to it and I just deal with it however some endurance veichles are too slidey for me to control without traction which I prefer not Funny things about the game..Commentator: He is saying all sorts of crap, Peter and Dunken are very funny and can say technically stupid things or even when they dont say stupid things they can befunny for me..UUUUUH there was a naaasty crash.. Looks like somebody has lost control. xD and every times it happens they say it with the same sound xD.We got some of the world best drifters out there, xD And a bonus to the end (not a cracker or anything amazing)When I am in career mode selecting a contract the girls starts talking. ""Liqui Moly racing team are reqruiting for their team after ur performance... blalbla I am just talking with her and I know what she is exactly saying so I am saying the same line as her when she is supposed to say something new :Dthats all for now this will be updated in the future and will add more things which i noticed and will correct it			",3,1,4,0,3,0,0

												GRID Autosport is a masterpiece of the racing genre, everything that was criticized from GRID 2 was pulled back redone and tightened.  The overall product is a fantastic experience of realism of raw metal and rubber.  The controls are tight and beautiful and every detail that went into this game is there to catch your eye and heighten your experience that much more.  I give this racer a 10/10, it is a complete racing simulation that GRID 2 should have been.Video Review Below

												I'll preface this by saying that GRID Autosport is the most ""hardcore"" racing game that I own, so I'm not a simmer in any sense of the word. That being said, I play with a Track IR 5 and Logitech G25 on the ""manual H-patten + clutch"" setting on a 34"" ultrawide 21:9 display and it's very immersive. It's even possible to heel-toe downshift but sometimes it's a bit tricky since there's no feedback in the pedals. For a game, it's plenty of fun. The car selection is nice and the track selection is pretty good too. Generally I stick to GP circuits and play either open wheel or hot hatch since everything else just feels like a drift fest to me, but maybe I'm doing it wrong or something.Oh, and did I mention that it works on Linux and MacOS X too? I've played a bit on Macbook Pro running El Capitan with a Xbox 360 controller pad and the splitscreen works beautifully with full rumble support and everything. I've also got it running on Linux Mint 17.3 with my Logitech G25 with full force feedback and 900 degree support too.GRID Autosport has something for everyone and has great OS support and controller/wheel support. Get it!			",85,26,10,4,5,0,18

												The very first GRID was (and still is) my favorite arcade racing game. It had customizable difficulty, it had teams and sponsors and your really didn't have to be always first to win a championship (something that NFS Shift 2 had problems with). You could buy your own cars and customize it, so you can see how you progress through the game. And it was fun to play with AI, since it wasn't really good (i.e. cheating) or really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The game just really balanced between arcade and sim and did it really good.Now in Autosport you still have customizable difficulty and same championship system. And it's pretty much it. AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that would just crash into you giving no♥♥♥♥♥♥about it whatsoever. You can't buy cars (well, you can in multiplayer, but you'll be given a car anyway when you joing a race). Well, I know that you race with teams and sponsors just provide you cars, but come on, it's not a sim, it's 100% NFS-like arcade, so what's the point of that? You don't really progress, you just comlete one season to unlock another and that's it (it gets really boring very quick. You know, the AI and♥♥♥♥♥♥. Oh, don't forget annoying bugs with resolution and fullscreen mode. So after all I would not recommend Autosport (even on sale). Just grab Race Driver: GRID instead.			",52,3,1,5,1,1,10

												Well, it's exciting and in higher difficulty your opponents provide enough challenges. But it feels even more tilted to arcade side comparing to grid 1. Some times you can turn 90 degree sharp in a speed which will almost certain to cause slide. And when you slide, you can gain your control back without much trouble.Graphics are still decent by today's standards, but sky is static and a little distracting.			",71,4,2,6,4,1,13

												Its cool. The handling is pretty nice, the tracks are pretty nice ( while it misses some important like Laguna Seca) and overall it has very much variety in it races. While it has some things i dont like1. The Medium AIs are to easy while the Hard AIs are a bit too hard.2. You cant customize your cars in the career, you can tune the stiffness and stuff but you cant make your own liverys or changes wheels and stuff.3. Its getting pretty boring after you beaten the second GRID series ( there are 3 GRID series in the game)			",5,0,4,0,1,0,0

												I have played more racing games in over 20 years than I could ever remember. While not the worst racing game I have ever played, It is a long way from the best.  Controls and handling of the cars is not really an issue except to point out that keyboard players should expect to be at a disadvantage.The main problems are the AI, the lack of visibility and the atrocious in car view.The AI is following the same principle that has been used for a few years now. That is they are ""heavy"" meaning you cannot ram them and expect to see them suffer much. Unfortunately that the same does not apply in reverse, and you will often find yourself losing many positions or even out of a race after being hit by the AI. What make it worse in this game, is the AI generally doesnt see you or care. They will maneuver to overtake on a corner, then  switch into your lane after a few seconds, regardless of where you are. This only applies if your are not drift/sliding around the corner. In this instance you do not exist and that will blindly drive right into you. If by chance you get t-boned and stuck on the front of thier car, then race over. They will not stop to let you off, and will happily push you as far off the track as they can go before hitting a wall or running out of momentum.Visibilty in this game is not something you will notice much as the graphics are quite nice. The problem does become apparent on the more technical circuits though. The issue is you can see a lot of scenery, but very little of the road ahead. In many places the corners are hard to judge as you can not really see a far as you should be able to. It is like an artificial limit on the draw distance. Using the best line feature can help, but if you cannot see much of the road, you wont see much of a line on the road either.Now for the in car view. Its there.... partially. This is absolutly the worst view I have EVER seen in a car game. Not only do they further restrict your view by making you feel like you are to small to look over the dash, but the whole interior of the car is blurred W...T...F!!! Bonus xp for limiting views to incar only, but not worth it.People who played Grid 2 online are in for some good news. You can buy quite a few cars in this game without having to play online for 100hrs. Bad news is there are now something like 50 catagoeries, so you will still get stuck having to use loan cars until your 100hrs is up.			",1045,608,64,110,138,14,170

												Since I saw this game was on sale for $9.99 today I decided I should write a review for people looking at this game. First off, I don't think I have ever seen this game go on a 75% off sale, and for the record I got this game for free. GRID Autosport is probably one of the best racing games on Steam in my opinion. The graphics are great, and it runs well on my average PC.      The career mode is very unique, with you playing as a professional racer who drives across 5 different disciplines: Touring, Endurance, Open Wheel, Tuner, and Street. Touring is basically normal racing on tracks all across the world. Endurance is similar, but the races are a lot longer and require you to manage your tires by deciding when to put wear on them and when to hold back. Open Wheel features open wheel Formula 1 type cars. Tuner events are drift competitions set into heats, and also time attack where racers begin in a staggered moving start and try to set the fastest lap speed rather than the highest position. Finally, Street is racing on tracks made in tight city streets with many sharp turns and short tracks. As you progress through the different disciplines you unlock new Season opportunities and get closer to racing in the GRID, where all disciplines are tested in one competition. For events you do not get to choose the car you drive, which some people don't like but I am fine with. The game is structured into racing seasons where you pick one discipline and a season with preset races and cars. Seasons can also feature a special event where maybe everyone drives the same car or something. When a season ends you can choose a new season from any discipline. The game will save your progress between events so you don't have to play a whole season in one sitting. For each season you can also choose a racing team which gives different challenges or offers which give you bonus XP. For example, improve your lap time, finish above 5th position, lead for a lap. Also, for most racing events each racing team has two drivers. You recieve a teammate with a description and stats (however I do not think the stats really have a great impact on them). During the race you can order your teammate to hold their position, push for a higher one, or just have the default balanced approach. The racing itself is quite good, featuring a penalty system for infractions like going off track and gaining a position by way of that. There is also a replay feature, similar to Forza Horizon where you can rewind the last seconds where you may have crashed or made a mistake. For racers who don't like this feature, you can disable it, and you will receive an XP bonus. There are also other setting you can turn on or off that will increase your XP bonus or lower it. For inexperienced racers I would recommend turning on the driving line which displays the best path to take on the track and where to brake. Now, a lot of the times you can make big gains in races by way of road rage and muscling your way through the competition, I have to admit I do this some of the time. As long as you are on the track you receive no penalty, however if you take enough damage, your steering column, engine, or tires can be damaged. The multiplayer is fun, one thing is that you have to set your Steam download region to UK-London in order to find matches. From what I've heard this will not affect your downloads and it hasn't seemed to affect me so far. Surprisingly the multiplayer features the rewind function, however it will only rewind your car while everyone else keeps racing, so its really only for big mistakes. By racing in multiplayer you earn money and XP and can buy new cars. There is no customization and the cars you buy are just for multiplayer. All In all I think this is a great racing game and a steal for such a big sale. I probably would not buy this game for full price however, but if I didn't have it and saw it on this sale I would definitely grab it! Great graphics, good career mode, good multiplayer, nice music.NOTE: This game like most racing games is best with a CONTROLLER.			",101,10,1,7,8,0,8

												Not my cup of tea. It's neither a sim nor arcade. It's somewhere in the middle which honestly makes a lot of the vehicles behave chaotic. One moment you're taking a corner at 160 km/h and the next your car flies off the track at 30 km/h on a less drastic turn.Either make it a real sim or stick with the arcade. This hybrid doesn't work.			",55,14,6,8,8,0,8

												GRID autosport... what can really be said about this game? Lots, but long story short this game rewards driving skill.You have to hold the line, work the throttle, and have the patience to wait for the moment to pass. The bs drifting advantage is over. Only in select situations does drifting help. So far as I can describe through play, this game by design cuts down greatly on the demolition derby that was GRID 2. The A.I. is definitely challenging, but that may just be since the driving dynamics are different from other GRID titles so passing wouldn't be as familiar.The sound of the game has some notable improvements from G2. There are cockpit rattles in various cars. The engine sounds are satisfying, tires, exhust notes, radio chatter...blah blah. It sounds better.One aspect of the game I am enjoying a lot more are the RaceNet challenges. Again the driving dynamics make this particular game mode great, they take work to complete with platinum medals.Should you pick this game up? Depends if you're an arcade racer or not.

												Looks good. Has probably the most hateful AI in a game I have ever seen. They just smash into you. Their cars seem to knock you off track with the slightest bump, whereas if you hit them they don't budge an inch. Super-aggressive AI makes this game, which looks good and feels good, absolutely infuriating. Can't recommend it.Still it was on sale. And it WAS fun smashing into my friend in split screen mode. I suspect it would be better with a proper wheel and pedal set-up, but I'm not going to buy one just to be whacked about by the suspect AI in this game.I played TOCA 2 back in 1999 or 2000 on PSone. Loved it. Played it to death. Made by the same folks who produced this game I think. The AI in it were totally fine, perhaps not aggressive enough, but it WAS fun. How can 15 years go by and their game evolves to this? I'll probably sink a few more hours into it, see if it grows on me, you never know. If nothing else, the time trials aren't affected and I like trying to beat my own times round a track. Would I recommend it? -  on sale, perhaps. It hasn't made me want to look out for the next installment, that's for sure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

  Short: I rate this game a  6/10 as of January 2016 .Pros: Supports a lot of racing wheelsVery playable with a controller or keyboard Singleplayer with a lot of racesMultiplayer with Clans ( Racing teams ), custom lobbies Some car customizationCons:  Multiplayer is dead Support systems are perfect ( Can't improve certain things by using a wheel )  A lot of 500-2000h people that own all upgrades on cars and will always finish top places People with the most points always start first.  DLCs ( Yes DLCs are always a Con for me. ) Boring Singleplayer ( Stopped after the second season because it's basically: Choose a team, race , race, Choose a better team, race, race ) Read the full review for my salt.  Long: I owned Grid 2 before, been playing it with keyboard and controller, very arcady indeed.Preordered Grid Autosport when it got announced, played it a couple of hours on release, more of a sim-arcade game than just arcade ( Can't drift around corners anymore and be faster than others ). Now this doesn't have to be bad actually I liked it at first but I never really got into the game during that time, rather played different genres. I played it now and then and every time I had the same feeling and ended up playing other stuff again because of the following reasons:Grid Autosports has upgrades that you can install into your vehicle to boost its performance (Better acceleration for example), for these you need to have a certain level on your car (which you have to buy with ingame cash if you want to level up the car ). Basically this means if you play the game a lot you get better cars ( besides owning cars in the first place ).Again this is something most online games have, reward players that play the game.One problem with this is that the game is basically unplayable and very very very frustrating in multiplayer as a ""beginner"" as you can't theoretically drive faster than people that have upgraded cars, which means you can't, again theoretically (before you argue you can still do that by skill... ), do better than people with upgraded cars.As you get XP and Cash mainly based on your placement and the amount of players this means you're going to have hard times leveling up and buying new cars. (Cash problem can easily be solved by doing RaceNet-Challenges ).This problem also gets supported by the fact that the Multiplayer is pretty much dead ( EU-Experience ). You may get a full touring lobby on Sundays but then again you will have to race mostly high level players ( Talking about people with somewhere between 700-2000h in this game ).The ""reward people that play the game "" - system can also be seen at the start of a race: The guy with the most points starts first ( If you just sit in a lobby for long enough and play a lot you will always start on pole ). If you're lucky enough to find a full lobby with some low rank players you will have to start at the very back and probably get rammed out of the first turn. Now you could still have more driving skill than some high skill players, maybe you're thinking because you own a wheel you get advantages as you do in other games but I'm sorry to tell you that you're wrong.As I said earlier this game is somewhere between Arcade and Simulator, therefor it's easily playable with a controller or keyboard, multiplayer doesn't have any specific rules on game supports ( ABS , Shiftmode , TC , stability control, ... ) you can enable what ever you want. Enabling those also doesn't really give you a disadvantage ( you get less xp but that's not really noticible ), having TC enabled for example just saves you from accelerating too quickly but if you choose to fully accelerate you still accelerate perfectly. I am personally using a racing wheel ( T300RS ) and I feel like this is sadly the case for most settings. Manual shifting / sequential is worthless, just more work for your brain and automatic shifts perfectly anyways.Basically this means you can play this game just as well on a controller as you could on a racing wheel. Good if you own a controller - bad if you own a 300€ or more racing wheel and get no advantages.Conclusion:As reviews should tell people who are interested in buying this game if it's worth it or not I'm going to say: Probably not.If you're looking for an arcade game, don't care if you finish last most games and not play with a lot of players ( yes there are private lobbies ... sometimes ... if you're lucky ... so basically never (  let's be real )  ) or if you just want to play this game in singleplayer, go ahead and pick it up.If you actually want a racing sim, play a game where you feel like it's good to own a wheel and not get dusted by people who may be worse drivers than you but still win because they played the game a lot then don't buy this game.Personally I never expected this to be a racing sim but rarely finding lobbies and having to play people who play this game all day is annoying. Also I feel like you should be able to drive better if you own a wheel, support systems shouldn't do everything perfect so there's something to improve by using a wheel. ",59,16,7,13,24,1,17

												I don't know why am I even writing this review but I really want to. Have all grid titles including Grid and Grid 2 in my Steam Library but never touched them. Bought Grid AutoSport + Season Pass just because I had money to waste (and maybe to show off to others that I buy expensive games) and I think it is one of the beautiful mistakes I've made in my life. I was always an avid follower of F1 and thats why I love racing games. Played almost all newer NFS titles where you kind of get a supercar and blast through all the racer and get 1st , 2nd or 3rd place almost every time. Played this game and I got a reality check about what actual racing is. I selected the ""Easy"" AI Mode but after 4 races (15th Place , 14th Place , 9th place and 16th place *I ain't joking*) . I had to set the AI to ""Very Easy"" mode. Even after that , I've managed to get the podium 2 times ONLY (2nd and 3rd) even after playing almost 30+ races. If you think you've mastered racing games just because you can play NFS , play this game. I'm sure you'll love it. Although I understand that this game is frustrating at times just because the amount of complexity you'll have to go through e.g. In Online mode car damage will affect your car's performance and trust me when I say that I wanted to threw away my laptop just because I couldn't come 1st in a race just because my car's handling failed after getting hit by another car. I've only played like 2-3 games online so I dont know much about that but I'm really enjoying the Single Player mode.As of now , I've only tried ""Touring"" and ""Endurance"" disciplines but I plan to try other ones soon enough. And about the optimization part , I'm running this game maxed out in Intel HD 5200 and haven't encountered a visual glitch till now. Also , the visuals are really top notch. Somethimes when playing , I felt like I was racing in a real world (but I'm too much dreamy so you can ignore that part :'D ) This game also has a good set of cars and racing tracks ..... Well , to finish , I know I spoke too much in my review but if you can , buy this game. You'll have countless hours of fun like I'm having .... Thank You again for reading this length pile of garbage.  P.S. I never played Asseto Corsa and don't plan to. So , please don't tell me about how Asseto Corsa is better than Grid : Autosport even if it is !! Thank You :)			",414,101,17,52,49,2,57

												Basically it should have been a DLC for Grid 2, nearly everything is taken from it. The rushed interior view is a joke and the whole concept is tedious especially the Endurance races. Don't buy the DLC unless you intend to play online, it has no impact on the single player.			",223,41,10,29,18,0,15

												This is a racing game made for racers. People who genuinely love motorsports. People who have actually DONE motorsports before. People who know what racing really is like in real life. This review is written having only played the game with a G27 racing wheel and only manual sear shifting with all HUD's disabled for the most racing like experience. I've done my fair share of track days and i can tell you, think is the most realistic car racing game i have played. There's plenty of people complaining the game feels too slow, the cars don't grip in corners blah blah. Well guess what, those people have never driven on a track in their life. When on a racing track, unless you're in a ultra fast ferarri or koensigg or something, guess what, you feel SLOW. That's how it is. Your car is slow. People are so used to **** car sims that put so much emphasis on feeling like you're flying along or arcade racing games that let you go around corners at 400kph that they have no idea what it's actually like to race a car. So more on the good parts. The handling of the cars: Fantastic. Cars handle how they should. FWD understeers coming too hot into a corner, or if you put power down coming into a corner and you can even get the♥♥♥♥♥out with lift off oversteer when driving really agressive. All of that is true in a FWD cars handling characteristics and they are all spot on in the game. RWD cars oversteer if you power on too much mid corner, or over a crest. You can really feel the suspension working. Coming super hot down a hill into a banked corner? Your suspension will start to wallow like a real car trying to deal with sideways g-forces, and if not careful in a RWD car, will cause oversteer. Graphics: AMAZING. Holy **** The attention to detail is amazing. From the different exhaust outputs of the cars (some will be obviously running rich, some not, etc) to the in car view of the dash being out of focus (because you're looking at the track, not the car) but obviously having some type of MOTEC carbon fiber HUD in place of the standard cars one, to the general cars decals and body panels. The world around looks so gorgeous, beautiful lighting, amazing scenery, and really perfect track textures. Racing modes: The only thing the game is missing in terms of racing modes is drag racing and rally. Which is not a downside to me. Drag is always a short lived interest in racing games and rally is much a massive part of racing it really does require its own game. One massive thing to note is the different racing game modes all have different racing styles. Touring cars are mega aggressive, open wheelers really require you to be careful with damage on and time attack is like how time attack is with sporadic cars you have to deal with. Sounds: I love the fact you can hear the tyres gripping, the straight cut gears int he gear box and the pop from fuel injectors still being on when your changing gears, because screw fuel efficiency. Its the little things: To me what really makes this game great is the little things. Like picking a perfect line through a series of corners then coming out and realising you just shaved a second or 2 off your lap time. The spectators not being 2d, the clouds and lighting are so gorgeous and the cars look amazing. Even the simple and elegant UI still keeping perfect functionality. The fact you log in, and the game says with voice ""Welcome back (name here), there's some new events in the touring car championship, go check them out!"". You can really tell Codemasters have really put their heart and soul into this game. Summary: If you're a grown adult that loves racing, and has done it before, this is the game for you. If your some pimply teenager that thinks GTA and Need for Speed are racing simulators, this isn't for you.			",28,4,1,0,0,0,0

												I only recommend this game if you can get it for like 50%-75% off price. It's not worth the full price. It definitely don't deserve the simulation tag. All cars drive like a motorboat.They ignored the cockpit view detail and use super ugly low res road texture.  2 of the most important aspect in a racing game especially for simcade/sim.You need a good gamepad to enjoy this game, preferably an Xbox 360 controller or something similar. Buying a racing wheel for this game is a dumb move.			",77,13,7,19,9,1,9

												It looks nice but that is about it. The cars seem to have too much oversteer and it feels more arcadey than Need for Speed. I was lured in by the free DLC for the demo derby. I think I dislike this game because they completely missed the target on that. The demo derby mode is just like everything else in the game, cars are aggresively racing you to cross the finish line 1st. Its kind of a figure 8 race I guess? A simple youtube search would show you what a demo derby is. And to whoever gave this a ""simulation"" tag, go play an even numbered Gran Turismo, Forza or maybe Need for Speed Shift so you can see what a sim racer is.			",19,1,2,4,11,0,9

												Engine-wise, this is the most optimized game I've played in the last 10 years. Everything is super light and responsive with gorgeous graphics on mid-range PCs, and with acceptable graphics on low-end PCs.There is not enough diversity in cars, despite the many categories (even F1-like cars), but there are a lot of different tracks to drive on.Music is annoying and generic, and does bad job at complementing such a beautiful game.Car damage is realistic and affects driving in a major way - this is not the game to ram your opponents off the track.For me personally, in the age of games that struggle on quad core CPUs and 2+ Gb GPUs to deliver mid-res textures and questionable lighting, the biggest advantage of GRID Autosport is how amazingly beautiful and lightweight its graphics engine is. Definitely restores my faith in developers.I have not noticed any bugs so far, and I've played it way more than my profile shows, outside of Steam.Career is a bit boring, or at least it was to me. Driving aside, a race pilot's career is not very interesting to begin with. But it does provide an extra bit of addrenaline to the regular racing experience.			",78,11,4,6,6,0,11

TL/DR REVIEW: Pretty good.Grid Autosport is a pretty casual racer. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is looking for a simulation experience. It has a great car and track selection which kept me interested for quite a long time. The AI was OK I guess, I didn't really notice anything special in a good or bad way. I wouldn't expect too much from the online aspect, strangers will generally race dirty or be incompetent. All in all this game delivers a couch gaming experience while giving off a semi-realistic vibe. It's kind of like a poormans forza. I am happy I picked it up on a good discount, and recommend waiting for one.Final noteThis is not an in depth or complete review of the game. It simply sums up my experience with the game in an effort to help you make a more informed purchasing decision. ",84,1,10,1,12,1,7

												GRID is more detailed...not just the cars,but the environment.It's a good combination between simulation&arcade.Better optimisation and better graphics (minus the cockpit view).Project CARS does better at simulation,but it requires too much hardware for what it delivers in terms of graphics.I still play GRID Autosport on PC and Driveclub on PS4.I am waiting for Assetto Corsa on PS4.Cheers :D﻿			",55,6,12,1,7,0,12

												Fun game to pick up every once in a while. Looks great, runs great and if you're like me and you want the new Forza but you don't have an xbox one, this game is probably your best option. My only complaints are that some of the cars feel kinda floaty (for the lack of a better word) and I would've liked to see some regular street cars and maybe some older cars.			",132,18,35,9,23,4,8

												Game is lots of fun. Vast variety of cars and championship.I do feel like the Ravenwest guys are way too fast in comparising to the other AI. Especially in Endurance. It's weird having 2 Ravenwest cars on your tail for 10 minutes and have the 4th place AI gapped by 1500 meters.I also wish you could've customised your own car in singeplayer instead of riding with a pre-made livery.

												9/10 Pretty fun racing game! I expected it to be more realistic when it comes to car handling, but it is in fact quite arcady and a bit loose. I am playing with a Xbox controller and the controls are not super responsive and direct when it comes to the steering with the L joystick, but it's acceptable. You might need to get used to it a bit in the beginning, after that it's fine.The game has a ton of cups and challenges to keep you busy for many many hours (enough content). Even with the arcady feel it is actually quite chalenging to drive against the AI! So far as I have played the amount of different tracks is quite low, I played for 7 hours and only driven half a dozen different tracks (and reversed), also the amount of different cars and classes is quite low.One really noticable quality gap in the game is the cockpit view. It is really low detailed in most/all cars and they made the cockpit on the lower part of your screen blurry to camouflage it. It is extra noticable, because basically everything else in the game is pretty solid and good quality.As for realism I think this game falls far below the racing sims on the market. Even Gran Turismo feels more real (direct/responsive) when it comes to car handling, but the AI in GRID is way more fun to race against and the races are more custimizable then in Gran Turismo. I also don't think that this game tries or was intended to be a realistic racing sim, but an enjoyable not over complicated racing experience. And that it does quite well.Overall I think this is a pretty solid and fun racing game and worthy to pick up during a sale.			",132,35,10,18,5,5,10

Posted: April 12, 2015
												Yet another beloved Codemasters game saga. ""Race Driver"" games have been out there since early 2000, and although the name of the latest games has changed gradually to ""GRID"", the focus of the saga keeps exactly the same as in its origins nearly 15 years ago. I have got the 2002 ""Pro Race Driver"" and from it I could get a well-determined scheme of what the saga is meant to be like. First of all, the title says it all: Pro Race Driver. Yup, you are a race driver going from the bottom to the top of Motorsport, always on tarmac races. What we get then is a large variety of cars and circuits to make the ladder along the career changing and entertaining. Back in 2007, with ""Race Driver GRID"" being released (and in my all honest opinion, one of the best games I've ever played), the saga was brought back. Later in 2012, the game library grew with GRID 2 to finally lose the name ""Race Driver"" and pretend like it was a brand new saga. Now, after the release in 2014 of GRID Autosport, some say this may be the end of the GRID saga. As exposed before GRID is actually part of the Race Driver saga, so maybe the next tarmac-racing game by Codemasters may not be called GRID but will still be part of the RD line. No developer is stupid enough to let down one of their most successful sagas ever while it still sells well.After some context introduction, it's time for the actual review:At first sight this brand new game might look like a GRID 2 DLC. Visuals are almost identical to it, and as in the store page what you see from the game are screenshots, you feel convinced of your opinion. GRID Autosport shares a lot of visual features with GRID 2 indeed. But the game is directioned in a completely different way. First up, GRID 2 was mostly about street races with road cars. GRID Autosport is undeniably focused on circuit races. This may not look like a big difference, but it actually makes the game feel 100% renewed.I think I share the opinion that having to unlock the 75% of the cars in game sucks. Or that to race certain competitions you have to pass through the ♥♥♥♥♥est races in the ♥♥♥♥♥est circuits with the ♥♥♥♥♥est cars. At GRID Autosport they have broken up with that annoying tradition and you are completely free to start your career mode in whatever competition category you prefer. For example, if you hate street races you can always kick off the Endurance season if you fancy. A great kudos to Codies for that. Plus if you want to take up a quick race at any game mode you can race with any car in game. They are all available from moment you click the ""Play"" button on Steam for the first time.Another huge improvement in which most of the upgrades of this game are based is the graphics engine. 4K compatible and stable at 60FPS or more, which basically means that the game is ridiculously well built. If you don't own a top GPU which supports these new performance features, you still get a good bit with high FPS and affordable higher settings. GRID 2 was annoyingly bad in that way, with massive FPS drops and nonsense low FPS on any setting... Graphics are clear and textures are the summit of all Codemasters titles. Grass, tyres, tarmac trees are brilliant. Cars keep the trend of ""so-so"" quality though. Modelling is not extremelly accurate, but still decent.Physics were a huge problem in GRID 2. The 2007 GRID was much better in that field, and now these realistic physics are back. If you spin off the track and insane speeds and get onto the gravel, you are likely to end up rolling. Track bumps fit properly-made suspension works. If you go real quick on a staright and there's a steep lift on the track, you may take off the tarmac shortly. If you go full YOLO out of a turn and drive over the curb you can be sure to be going to lose control of the car. Just some remarkable examples of how well detaled this game is.Handling confirms that the latest addition to the saga is still an arcade. It would be better to say it is a mixture between a sim and an arcade. Handling is not at all precise. At any turn you'll have to make slight drifts to get hold of the car because if you just lock the pad axle on a single position the car is going to oversteer as if it had been kicked from the tail by Superman. This is common through all the previous games. If you get the purpose of this handling's characterictics you'll believe you're a pro racer saving the driving line with corrections. If not, you'll leave the game apart thinking it is unplayable. It's all a question of practice though.Codemasters warned that AI is so dirty in this game. They somehow managed to program an AI that is not dumb at all but behaves as any real online racer. It has personality... Plus the amazingly-superbly-awesome new feature of radio interaction with your trackside engineer. By pushing some buttons you can ask him for any information about race status and your car's damages and tyre wear. Also, you can tell your team mate to be more aggressive or to defeat his position. Real cool stuff.Sound field. I do think that at Codemasters they copy-paste the car sound files from one game to another. It is true that GRID Autosport has a wider range of hi-fi sounds like wind, crowd cheering and more accurate gravel and grass sounds when you spin off the track. Engines just sound the same, just a ridiculous high-pitched monotone sound. Of course it has some remarkable distinctions for some cars. Some Endurance cars sound just too badass, but the sound itself looks too simplistic.Cockpit camera was painfully missing in GRID 2 and now it is back. Interestingly there are two on board cams available, one nearer from the windshield than the other, more driver-eye like. At first sight you'll see a major difference from any other on board cam from any other game. I don't know if it is made on purpose to bring one of the best graphics effects ever on a racing game or a merely ridiculous attempt to hide bad work on the cockpits. The thing is that the interior of the cars are blurry and anything from behind the winshield is nitide. In my opinion it looks absolutely mega, but that's up to everyone's opinion.So does GRID Autosport stick to the scheme of the rest of the ""Race Driver"" games? Indeed. Career mode keeps the essence of being focused on you as a driver exactly as the 2002 game did. So many circuits with their variants and an impressive range of cars. It never gets boring.8/10			",81,10,13,2,6,1,3

												besides your top of the line simulater games like iraceing and forza and project cars, grid auto sport is up there with the best for sure. i have spent alot of time on this game on my xbox 360 and now i am playing on the pc and i still love it. the sound of the engines and tyres in this game are awsome and the pyshics and looks of the cars are awsome. havent found another game that has the aussie v8 utes in them and they sound amazing. great choice of cars to. definalty love playing this game.. the only downside is im useing the logitec g920 and the responce is a lil sloppy. when you turn the wheel like 5 to 10 degress to the left or right the car wont turn untill you go past that. so in other words the first lil turn left or right isnt responsive, but once u go past that its fine and works well. and that also is with all the settings turned up. other downside is there is  no calibration setting to calibrate your wheel if that setting was in the game it would fix this problem. other than that 10/10 for me on this game.

Gameplay is just right with gamepad, cars handle great, and you can switch between driving aids and even if you are only starting with it you will have fun.

												Great racing game. Lots of cars, tracks and disciplines. The cars handle very well; you have to learn how to drive them properly around corners and the game helps with the learning through visual assists.Touring cars remind me of Toca 2.The AI really fights for every inch of tarmac which adds a lot to the adrenaline and competitive atmosphere. I love that and I think I felt it most at ""medium"" difficulty.I noticed many times the AI cars follow the racing line religiously(mostly while cornering) and in some cases they'll ram you off the track because of it, but that usually happens when driving kamikaze style, not like a racer would. You'll learn to be aware of other cars.The game doesn't have a storyline to help drive progression like in Grid 1. Instead you feel more like a professional driver fighting to climb up the ranks. You can play only one discipline if you want to.It's nice you can choose to stick with a team for a few seasons before moving to another one.The commentators before the race are a nice touch :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												MY BIGGEST IN DEPTH REVIEW EVER! I previously reviewed Grid 2 and I will start with a familiar sentence those who read my grid 2 review will know. Codemasters, my dear old friend. I have been a loyal supporter since Colin Mcrae Rally 2.0, stretching from V8 Supercars 1, 2 (Xbox) to TOCA Race Driver 3 and even the Formula One games (My fave) Its only fair I review GRID: Autosport. In a nutshell, its an improvement over GRID 2. OK LETS GET INTO IT! Again I shall start with the cons.-ConsFirst the AI. Easy to catch, bloomin hard to keep them behind you. It seems there is a rubberbanding effect here where the cars behind get a performance boost when you pass, especially the top drivers (looking at you Westley). Rubberbanding provides a challenge to the player but it kinda makes it frustrating all your effort catching (even on hard difficaulty) suddenly goes to mud because the AI suddenly go faster. And on the subject of AI they REALLY get aggressive out there. For example in Open Wheel (more about classes in the pros!) It is supposed to be NON CONTACT. But they do not leave space, and I found myself getting spun when they slam into me in the breaking zones like im not even there or they re-pass on the inside and clip my rear wheels with their wing. THis is a long paragraph for a single con. -Damage. This is a pro and con. Its more about the AI damage. They don't seem to have any issues with damage. I went the wrong way, smashed head on into an AI at over 200kph and sent him flipping through the air. When his car righted again he just continued although he did have a lose wing and cosmetic damage... he finished 5th... SO work there needs to be done.-Multiplayer. Again... I cannot for the life of me find a public match. Inviting my only other friend who plays the game is ok, but sometimes hes not always avaliable to play. This needs to be fixed. It happened on GRID 2 as well.OK CONS ASIDE!! Lets get into the really great pros.-Classes. The best thing about this game. Different choice of cars. Its obvious not every one likes the same race series. I hate Nascar, I love Formula One. It is great to see you can choose 5 different choices, from Drift to Open Wheel to Touring etc. It is the best thing about this game, and it brings me back to my V8 Supercars years.-Damage. Much improved damage on this game, parts come off, or cause your car to pull to the left/right, even lose a wheel, and manage to keep on racing (Put this in F1 2015 pls? k thx) although some pit stops would be nice/-Career. A big con. The intro introduces you to the mechanics of the game with a 2 lap intro race which is good to get up to speed and you can select which class to start/end with maybe open wheel, or drift any category you want. -ONBOARD CAMERAS. YES. DRIVING CAMERAS. T-CAMS. ITS WHAT WE DREAMED OF. AND WE GOT.-Custom races. This is a great feature. Any class, any track, any team. Up to 3 events each with custom lap amounts, practice and qualifying and setups!!! Whats best is the first race can start from qualifying spot, but the second race can start from reversed 1st race position (finish 1st, start last, finish 2nd, start second to last.) Its great!!!-Graphics. Only one word Amazing!Overall a great game for any racer out there. Easy to use with my g27 wheel. HIGHLY RECOMMEND~~!!!			",82,14,12,8,14,1,4

												Just like Cities:Skylines seemed to be closer to a next-generation version of SimCity 4 was than Sim City 5, so does Grid Autosport seem to be the heir to the throne that was last occupied by DiRT: Showdown (D:S).It is a great half-way point between super in-depth racers from the PS2-era of GT2 and GT3 and the arcadey racers.  It has depth in what it refines.Does it let you race bajillions of vehicles?  No, just from playing the ""street"" vein of the game I can tell that only a small handful (under 10) are available.  But because each of those dozen or so vehicles vary so much in their physics, each vein yields new challenges to personal skills that might've plateaued if just left to rot in one specific type.But it does add some great advancements: ""rivals"" which seem like the next non-team guy in points above or below you is one of them.  Another is the flashback where you get -- by default -- five times during one race to rewind the action so that spin-out or incorrect judgement of the entry speed on a corner doesn't happen.Yup, car collection is still there but not a focus.

												If you're familiar with TOCA Race Driver 3 You'll find this game very familiar. Several racing disciplines you can advance in  either one at a time or alternating between. Sadly no prerendered cutscenes of your crewchief congratulating you or mussy haired race enemies berating you.Drives very much like a codemasters game - definitely not a sim and definitely a little floaty but the cars are a little more planted than GRID. I've only done a few of the GT races so open wheel cars or the upper end cars may be different.Runs very well on Linux and easily the best naitive running racing game available.

												I'm a long-time fan of the Race Driver series and played every single one of them.The classic Race Driver games (especially RD2 and RD3) were absolutely superb games. Then came the first GRID and just added to it. It was a great game with decent cars, decent simcade handling, good racetracks (especially those Japan Docks). GRID 2 was a disaster. To anyone who knows Codemasters and the Race Driver franchise it's obvious that they just lost track of their heritage on this one. It didn't have a monetary system. The handling was changed to something that can only be described as super-arcade. The sponsor system was terrible too - supremely dumbed-down. And the AI was irritating. Generally just a bad bad Codemasters racing game.I told myself I'd never pre-order again, then came GRID Autosport.Which I didn't pre-order and bought on sale.BUTIt's a good game. Not GRID 1 good, but it's eons ahead of GRID 2. The single player mode isn't quite where GRID 1 had gotten it so right, with a lack of a monetary system and no ownership of cars. The music is about as bland as it gets too. The multiplayer, however, is where the game really proves itself. Earn money, earn xp and build your garage. Track your stats on RaceNet. Create or join racing clubs. Race vs friends, strangers or just AI. It really has a nice balance to it. There are community challenges to keep you interested and leaderboards to work against. Generally GRID Autosport is well rounded with handling only marginally below that of GRID 1.GRID Autosport proves that Codemasters have not lost their touch with racing games.

												Perfect mix between simulation and arcade racing. Beautiful graphics, really low loading times and endless settings can be changed if wanted. You can play this game just with the standard settings from the cars or fine tune them yourselves.I do recommend a steering wheel with pedals or at least a controller. I'm saving up for a Fanatec wheel with pedals and now  racing with a Xbox 360 controller. I also tried lot of other racing games like Project Cars (to much of a sim for me), Test Drive Unlimited 2 (too big of an open world for me), Need for speed series (too arcade for my taste), but since I started playing GRID2 I was hooked. Thankfully that nice balance between Sim and Arcade is still there in GRID Autosport. If you think you're not an arcade racer, but also not somebody who want's to play it too hardcore like a Sim, this is the perfect game			",70,6,5,4,15,0,4

												There's a problem with the Steam ratings system, and that's that you have a binary ""YES"" or ""NO"" as to if you'd recommend a game.  I need a third category for GRID Autosport, a wavy hand, non-committal noise, a sort of shrug.I'm a big fan of racing games in general and have been buying Codemasters racers since TOCA Race Driver 2.  I’ve bought GRID and GRID 2 and enjoyed them both, I actually wrote a positive review of GRID2 on Steam.  But GRID Autosport is...*does hand rocking back and forward motion*.So what's wrong?  The biggest fault in this game is the AI.  It’s bad, not terrible, just pretty stupid.  AI cars really want to hit that racing line.  Quite often you'll find them piling up at the first corner as they all try to take the same line through.  A savvy player can avoid the melee and gain quite a few places straight away.  More annoying is when you're taking a corner and the AI clips your back end sending you spinning out.  Of course, this happens in real world racing but it feels all to frequent in GRID Autosport making the AI feel cheap and frustrating.  It made me wonder if the flashback game mechanic was implemented because they couldn’t be bothered to fix the AI and decided that the player could just rewind and take evasive action should they get rear ended and end up in a wall!  But because the AI behaves so badly you don't really care about smashing them up to get ahead.  This can turn races into something of a demolition derby and ruins the immersion somewhat.  Far better was the system in Need For Speed: Shift which rewarded you for a more passive (or aggressive) racing style, that way you could at least play a persona.  Also the less said about the total waste of an AI race partner the better.  There's also nothing new here.  If you've played the last two outings you've seen most of what this game has to offer.  I might be mistaken but I think all the tracks are recycled and they've ditched the point-to-point racing that was so much fun in GRID2 (though you can get it back as DLC, it’s not part of the main career mode).  Drag racing could have been new and fun (reminiscent of the ace drag racing from Need For Speed Underground) but again, that comes as a DLC and isn't part of the main career. So what's right?  Graphically it’s quite the looker.  The cars are detailed (and there are quite a few of them), the tracks feel alive and interesting (racing through the construction site that is Dubai is a particular highlight).  The car handling seems to have been refined from the previous outing and the multi-disciplined approach means you really have to focus on how you drive as you, for example, switch between the easy to drive, stable at speed Touring Cars and the fast but skittish GT Race Cars.  Moreover the number of disciplines keeps things varied and interesting.  You'll be bumper to bumper racing in Touring Cars, managing your tyre wear in Endurance, getting sideways in Drift.  That you don't need to be the best in a particular discipline to progress is neat too (mid table finishes still earn XP, albeit slower than finishing top).There's enough in this game to keep me coming back (and I will do until I finish it because I'm compulsive like that) so because Steam only gives me a binary choice I'll give a thumbs up.  But this is likely the last GRID game I pick up.  The racing marketplace is about to get a whole lot more competitive with the exciting Project CARS on the horizon, and I reckon the GRID series, without an overhaul, will end up languishing in mid-pack.

												First off, this is a great game, I would definetly buy it if I were you.The physics model is a perfect balance of arcade and simulation, much better than GRID 2, which was like driving on soap. That makes this game very fun and playable with w,a,s,d and arrow keys.The car selection is huge, you get everything in between hot hatches and formula 1. Touring cars, muscle cars, hypercars, you name it, they have it.The graphics are great, obviously not the best in the world right now, but still insane.The frame rate is very constant, I dont have the best PC ever, only 6GB of ram and a core i5, but it still runs at 40-50fps pretty much no matter what I'm doing. I cant say the same for games like need for speed.The track selection is immense, granted, some of the tracks are just variations of the same track, but it's still difficult to run out of places to race.Multiplayer is great as well, impact ratings keep all of the jerks out of the race and let everyone have fun without being killed by some idiot driving on the track backwards.However, there are some flaws. For example, when GRID autosport says you are going to drive formula A, or formula 1, it gives you an indycar instead. Indycar and F1 are NOT the same thing.Another flaw has to be the DLC, which has been a problem for all of the GRID games. There is so much of it, and none of it is free. You want an extra car? Better have $5 lying around. This also effects multiplayer, half of the time the party leader is using DLC that you probably dont have, and there is usually no other party to join.The cokcpit wiew is super blurry as well, not a big problem, but still something I want to point out.My final thoughts? Still an excellent game. DO NOT listen to the people who say you are better off with GRID 2, ive played the game before, trust me, you want this one. Although I do recommend buying it on sale, the GRID series tends to be on sale more than most racing games on steam, so I was able to get it for 10 bucks. Also, if you are looking for a racing sim, go buy asseto corsa, do not buy GRID.			",16,0,10,1,9,0,0

The best racing game on GNU/Linux... as of today.Until the day DiRT Rally comes out... if SteamDB is not wrong.So, after fans complained that GRID 2 was too arcadey, left cockpit view out of the base game and missed the real race tracks, GRID Autosport brings back what the sequel was missing, and rewrites the handling of the game so it stick closer to that simcade balance from GRID 1.In short, the game can be formulated as ""GRID 1's spirit"" + ""GRID 2's technology and assets"".The game may have its flaws, but it's ultimately a good experience filled with variety. I should also mention that it has split-screen multiplayer, a rarity on PC games (and even current console games).What differences this version from Windows' is that it performs worse graphically, so if the game runs flawlessly on Windows, chances are you may experience some frame drops (unless your computer is that powerful). As a reference, playing on Nvidia has the same performance as playing on Windows + AMD card. BUT, considering how GNU/Linux works, if the game freezes, it won't affect anywhere else on the computer, where Windows could freeze itself entirely.______________________________________________Oh, one last thing: if your country uses commas to represent decimals (0,3333..3 as in ""one third""), use this command on launch:	LANG=C %command%Otherwise the game may not even launch!

												This game is AWESOME. Physics are on the dot, the game has a good single player campaign, cars handle as in real life, at least with the Xbox One Controller. Its very polished and I love the racenet boards where you can set times and scores and see how you stack up in teh world, no cheating there that I have seen (not like NFS:Shift, and DIRT3, lol those have tons of fake times online) Furthermore, the game just seems uber polished, I also bought Project Cars to compare but havent played it much yet, as an overall package I have to say this is #01 numero Uno as far as PC Driving games and realistic physics as compared to real life, but hey everyone is going to have a different opinion.

												The game runs with 60+ FPS on Ubuntu 16.10 with GTX 970, ultra settings and full HD monitor. I have a Logitech G25 Racing Wheel and it was just plug&play (you just have to enable FF from the game menu, as it is diabled by default).The new Era of Ubuntu gaming is here.Btw, the game is really nice. Feels sim-like. AI is kind of bumbing into you, but in a fun way and car damage isn't that bad so you don't mind. Each car has unique handling and it doesn't feel like they pushed cars just to have more graphics. They dedicated time to this. Also, the drift mode is fun and feels realistic. The game is worth the money.			",23,3,2,9,0,0,0

												I really like this game. Keeping in the arcade-game line, they added features from simulations, which is big PLUS for me.After few hours I am really glad I got this title. Controls are very fine for me (unlike other reviewers... I am using X360 controller). Summarized - I like the game, online modes and the way the game feels. Most Welcome for me is ability to create Racing Club with your friends in game (applicable after driving YOUR car with Race Club livery). Honestly I don't use cockpit view, so wheter it is there or not, all the same to me :)I recommend this game for everyone, who wants simulation-like racing, but with arcade in it (Honestly I hate games where you can set your precise gear ratios, angles of wheels and such... I am no mechanic, I am player). This is my view and in my view this game is 8,5/10 :)			",309,62,11,39,37,6,38

												Good game, but not pretty. Cockpit cam is a desaster (Race Driver Grid is much better). CODEMASTER have to fix this game. No mirrors, Blur, no head movements. If you are looking for a game more realistic, try Assetto Corsa, Project CARS or similars. Don't buy GRID Autosport.			",86,15,16,5,16,1,11

												Was Super Excited to get this game. And after spending about 5 hours trying to rewrite code because the game continually crashed on start-up, I finally gave up. I just built a brand new computer, (and the game came with one of the items i purchased.)and I am even running an AMD R9 not a nvidia, where the problems seemed to be originating from. It would get to the inital menus and then just crash out as soon as I would try to open a menu. And it seems from looking around for answers on the internet and here in the forums, there is simply no fix, at all. I might revisit this again in a few months if there does happen to be a few patches for this game, but constantly freezing up the whole computer is just not worth the risk. Codemasters, I will not download or purchase another one of your games on the PC, ever. -1/10 ",9,0,1,4,0,0,1

												(Singleplayer only)A really fantastic looking arcade racer that fills my racing fix when I just want to put in a few races. I normally can't put in more than two or three hours at a time though. It can't hook me in to play longer. I just end up getting bored. The game is now almost two years old now and it's still $40. It's not worth $40. I got it in a Codemasters bundle I think. Got this and a few other titles for $15 (great deal!). I really enjoy the Touring, Open Wheel, and Street seasons, but I'm not a fan of this game's Endurance (AI don't suffer from wear) mode and I hate Tuner.With a decent gaming desktop, I can run many of the settings on ultra, but have to lower some settings to keep the frame rate from dropping at high-intensity moments (especially when drifting with tire smoke). Ravenwest are my sworn enemies. When I get there, I will only run one season with them to get the achievement. They can screw off after that.Overall, it looks great, the AI are decent (but not perfect), and can fill that racing fix for about two hours at a time. Get it on sale. 50% off or greater.Edit: accidentally said Tuner twice. Changed to Touring			",16,3,6,7,11,0,14

												I have to admit that there is fun to be found here, but the game is still floaty as hell.  I honestly don't know what Codemasters is attempting to do.  With the first game, I thought they were going for the Forza/Gran Turismo market, which... they didn't succeed at.  With Grid 2, I have NO IDEA what the hell they were thinking.  So that brings us to Grid Autosport, which still doesn't seem to go for that sim feel, although it's much closer than Grid 2 ever was.  So if that's not the goal, this doesn't really feel like an arcade racer, either.  It just feels like a very pretty, but ultimately not-great racing game.  The entire series has an identity crisis, as if it doesn't know whether to be a sim or an arcade game, and that just leaves it teetering in the middle where nobody is going to be satisfied.

												Nope!  This game is offensively too broken to justify spending even $5 on if you intend to be chasing any sort of game progression or steam achievements. Sure, the racenet site is pretty terrible, does a poor job of barely handling the minimal functionality required to support the features for which it is needed.  Sure, the AI and other humans are often out of sync between gamers in the same multiplayer game.  Sure, you will usually find multiplayer lobby empty unless you switch your Steam download location to somewhere in the EU.  That's all relatively trivial next to the known save game corruption bug that's wiped out my progress twice within 6 months.Twice now, the game has rendered my save data corrupt.  Both times, this was after normal quitting of the game through the exit option in the menu.  This is apparently not uncommon, and has happened with a number of others.  None of the online racenet progress is actually stored online in any way that can be recovered.  Nor, for some reason, is the Steam cloud being leveraged to recover one's lost progress. Some gamers have recommended  disabling Steam Cloud support for the game, citing repeated failures by codemasters to handle it properly in other games.  Further, it's been recommended that users go through the hassle of digging into their C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\Userdata\<steamuserid>\255220 to save backups regularly.After the first time it happened to me, I disabled Steam cloud support, and made a copy of the 255220 userdata folder on occasion.  I eventually got comfortable and a bit lazy, and had not backed up for some time, at which point it occurred again.Hundreds of online races, purchases, upgrades, and funds lost.  Hundreds of career races and progress lost.  No way to complete the missing achievements without first redoing all the lost effort to get back to where you were before your save game data was corrupted.I honestly think this game could be good if the publisher could be bothered to fix the handful of bugs plaguing it.   It appears the developer has no intention of fixing any bugs in the game at this point.  Though one could argue hours of fun racing did occur, resetting users' progress when they are halfway through the achievements... repeatedly... is absolutely not an acceptable situation.Most active developers update their games with bugfixes as the need arises.  Codemasters apparently feels this game is complete, bugs and all, and is focused on putting their efforts into releasing new paid-for content instead of fixing the glitches.I could say save yourself the money, but honestly, save yourself the wasted time chasing achievements, and save yourself the frustration and anger at a developer who took your money and doesn't seem to care that the game is broken.Trivial lackings in addition to the above* no choice of tires* no choice of weather* no choice of road surface (all tarmac)* limited online garage slots prevent owning all vehicles			",411,144,31,94,103,5,95

												I was hoping for some decent racing game as a good excuse to put the track IR to work, but I was rather dissapointed within barely an hour of gameplay. The exterior textures looks pretty good and the handling feels decent enough, but that's really where the positive aspects ends. No matter how many settings I turn up, the interior of the car has horrendously low quality and blurry textures in comparison to the rest of the game. And after looking it up, that's apparently just the way it is, which does not reallty make alot of sense. And speaking of settings, I cranked them all the way up, as one should with a 1080, but only to find the the game then runs at a solid 20 fps. Add some cheesy unskippable cutscenes and you're good to go.Would not recommend.			",242,22,18,38,59,2,85

												Where do I even begin.  First off there is a horrible memory leak in this title that can bring a GTX 770 to it's knees in a heartbeat.  I can't even really play this game unless I turn off the FFB because my Clubsport Wheel bucks like a bronco and damn near tore my finger off.  It ping pongs back and forth sitting on the grid!!!I would stay away from this title until Codemasters learns how to do proper input support and it's patched three or four times.  The developers are amazingly silent on the many complaints in the forum and every time they do pop in, they insult your intellegence with some remedial computer pointers.The game is actually fun to play, when you can play it.  However the techincal failures are too much for me to bear at this point.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite there are wildly different opinions on this game, I find Grid Autosport to be a fairly enjoyable game with it's accessible yet fun driving physics, great content and a throwback to Grid 1 or even TOCA series that should set the foundation for the next Grid game. Grid Autosport also brings back the rather enjoyable multidisciplinary racing aspect of Grid 1 and TOCA series where the game features cars from exotic hyper cars, Australian V8 Supercars, Formula 3 Open Wheel, GT3s, drift machines and so on. The career is serviceable as the whole team management aspect in Grid 1 was axed so you are very much a driver for hire now which is disappointing to me. Personally, I would still recommend Custom Cup (or commonly known as Quick Race in most racing games) where you can choose to race with any car and on any tracks to your liking, considering all the cars and tracks are unlocked once you boot up the game. There are some issues with the game such as the poorly implemented multiplayer mode, AI that can be too aggressive at times and a lot of recycled content that some might find it to be a bit lazy. Still, with a revamped and improved driving physics, driving on tracks such as the licensed race track, Red Bull Ring in Grid Autosport is certainly more enjoyable than Grid 2.I do recommend Grid Autosport to you if you enjoyed Grid 1 or TOCA series but was disappointed with Grid 2's direction. Or you are racing game fan who is looking for a fun, accessible simcade with tonnes of content. If you stumbled upon this review on a sale, I do recommend you to pick up this game along with the Season Pass as there are some really enjoyable content in the Season Pass.			",225,47,45,30,30,1,80

												0/10 for incomplete game and too much 'launch DLC'Limit on cars you can use in MP... BLOWS!!!!Multiplayer aspect is either non-functional or dead- started up the game to not be able to join ANY servers if ANY kind what so ever. Don't even try to blame user error. I'm not doing any stupid fix that codemasters should have done. Bottom line multiplayer DOESN'T WORK. If the game advertises that it does have MP functionality that is a straight up lie. Look up how many people can't join any servers and stupid fixes and let that speak for itself.Coming from a long time GRID 1 player (600+ hours) this game tried to address everyones outrage to how terriblke Grid 2 was. Welll... they tried but didn't listen to what the customers wanted. People straight up told them to copy Grid 1 physics and have a cockpit view. Guess What?They screwed both of those simple request up. Cockpit view is a half♥♥♥♥♥low quality job that is laughable by todays standards. Driving physics are bad.. not bad as grid 2 but they are not enjoyable like Grid 1. I enjoyed driving in grid 1, The cars feel off and are not anything like cars in Grid 1 were. Grid Autoport lacks the soul of its  predesessor, I feel ripped off they even put Grid in the title and tried to play it off like ""ohhh yea we understand Grid 2 was a big pile of steaming dog poo..

												GRID Autosport, a petrolhead must have. The game is really long and entertaining. There are 5 types of racing (Touring, Endurance, Open Wheel,Tuner, Street), but if you are like me, guy that loves cars, you will enjoy everything about this game. From powersliding cars in most badass ways, circuit racing, formulas and even drag racing, there is everything for everyone. Game is really fun and variety of cars is really good, from Retro Legends to Modern Machines, you have it all. Tracks are very good and very well designed. Graphics look amazing and cars look stunning. It has good career mode but I'm really enjoying multiplayer with my friends. We were having a blast. So all in all pretty great game, and if you like cars, what are you waiting for?Verdict: Amazing+ Good Amount of Cars+ Real Life Tracks+ Awesome Graphics+ All Kinds of Driving: Racing, Drifting, Drag... etc+ Tough Opponents+ Multiplayer+ Car Customization			",47,3,12,4,5,2,3

												Because I am a fair human being and prefer to judge off my own free will, I chose to try it out regardless of all the hate. Boy am I dissapointed. Lets start with the good. The car models are stunning along with decent sounds. That's all really. the bad,  The tracks lack texture and results in a track that feels like tarmac on ice. I don't feel bumps I don't feel the steering tug. It's too easy. Now the most annoying thing is the damn A.I. they are animals! On Touring you expect logical drivers battling without ruining either race. But this isn't the case...... They will dive bomb you, Turn into you, Rear end you.

												We waited so long to have a nice racing sim on Linux,Finally Grid made it onto our tux boxes,The Game is really nice, codemasters really made a good jobAlso the Feral Interactive port for Linux is in a nice state no lagsexcept the fact that i had to overcome the launcher to start the game on linux, but after a quick forum search problem was resolved.Graphics are fantastic, not as fast as on the PC version but i would say the linux port is not more than 20-30 FPS slower than the pc version.The netcode was'nt pretty good in January '16 but maybe there will bea update in future.Negative was also the removed possibility to exchange the team pilot,and the inside view of the car is very detail-less..But anyway a really good racing sim (8.2/10) Grab it on sale and you can't do anything wrong			",40,4,1,0,2,0,0

												The drifting is awesome, the multiplayer is brilliant (if played with the right people). The game it's self with everything considered, mechanics, modesl and graphics as a whole are pretty good but there is one thing ruining this game.The AI.Holy ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥ the AI are the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, inconsiderate, unrealistic, and just plain stupid ♥♥♥♥ers ever. They smash into you on corners, break early to make you slam into them and simply don't care for their car or rules of the race! Which aren't even enfored!If you plan to just play MP buy it, if not then don't. Simple as that.			",92,6,9,5,17,1,7

												I like the GRID series a lot, and I'm not really into racing games in general. This series always feels like a throwback game to a lot of people, myself included. It's a solid game, and certainly worth the price. I've played a lot of GRID 2, so I'm sure I'll enjoy this one as well. It's not a huge leap different from G2, from what I've seen so far. Buy it. You won't regret it, especially considering it's a bargain at this price.			",58,3,3,0,2,0,3

												GRID Autosport is a very good game yet there's something missing from it. It could be because we've seen it all before, as there's nothing majorly brand new to the series in this game, however it does feel more like the original GRID than GRID 2. Which is a good thing for the original GRID's fans. A lot of tracks are repeated from GRID 1 & 2, but that's not a bad thing as most of these are the 'good' tracks including the made up San Francisco and Chicago one's. There's a nice selection of cars in game which beats its predecessors, I think, by quite a bit. A nice bit of variety, but no way near the amount of vehicles that you'd get in Forza or Gran Turismo. Then again there isn't really any need for that many. The handling of the cars is more similar to the original GRID with that essence of both arcade and simulation (GRID 2's was arcade) however it does lean more on the simulation side a bit more this time. This game was made in about a year as it came out due to complaints from the original GRID's fans. Oh it also has in- car cam in it now, more about that below in the Pro's & Con's bit:Pro's:Nice variety of cars/ disciplines- Touring Cars- Street Racers- Open Wheel & more. Graphics- As always, great graphics from Codemasters. Sharp and shiny. Lot's of tracks- Whether they be made up or real life, you will find a track that you like.Online- Is (I think) better than the Career mode. You can look up or set up custom sessions. But if you can't be bothered looking through things let it plough you face first in to a mixture of races! You can also be in clubs and change car skins/ livery's whatever you want to call it. Menu- I like the menu'sHandling- I think it's pretty damn good, no more drifting in every single car like in GRID 2.Con's:Music- Lack's music. GRID 1 & 2 had more variety and had a big part in the games.In- car cam- It's there, it's just blurry. There's also a dashboard cam. I'm not too bothered about it, I just don't get why they would have a good one in GRID 1 and not its sequels.Repeat tracks- Only bad for people who have played the other GRID's and want something new. AI- This one was difficult, they're nice and aggressive, but you can't help but feel they have the upper- hand some of the time. It's difficult to spin them out, but it's easy for them to do it to you.Career- A bit bland the further you go in to it, plus having a teamate makes you not want to have one. Also you can't make your own livery's.			",23,0,10,1,3,3,2

												Wowww.. Simply the best Oculus experience you can have in a racing game. I just bought this game to check out the experimental Oculus DK2 support! So far this has been one of the best VR experiences ever.. I didnt expect too much of it, but i was very suprised the support is realy realy good. Altough I didnt felt immersively overwelmed, this is one of the few games i can play for hours without any headaches and also a very very great game. not all menu's are supported, but the racing itself is a really awesome. Direct to Rift and Extended mode works perfect. Hope the GRID Team will keep on supporting Oculus, as its a truly remarkable experience!			",97,8,7,4,8,1,9

												I wouldn't say this is in the same league as other sims like Assetto Corsa, Forza Motorsport, or GT, etc., but it is definitely a fun little racer. In fact this game does do one thing better than any other racing game I've played, and that's making me feel like I'm the racecar driver and not the car itself. All other racers I've felt like a sentient car born with an urge to go as fast around a track as possible. In Grid Autosport I feel like a driver racing for my team and trying to get the attention of better teams so I can further my career. It makes winning more satisfying and battling it out against rivals even more intense. Get it while it's on sale and you'll be pleasantly surprised.			",142,40,13,21,28,2,13

												I didn't want to do a review of this so soon, but I had the torrent of this and logged a good 20 or so hours into it before it went on sale on Steam, so I think that is enough to have a good enough idea and experience to do one.First off the presentation of GAS is very well done. The introduction, the personalization and the way everything flows is very refreshing. The racing scene is pretty deep with various disciplines to choose from, though you will eventually have to do every one of them to get into the GRID series.The visuals are absolutely spectacular, especially for a game that only came out for PC and last gen consoles. GAS really shows off the best the EGO 3 engine has to offer and what's is capable of, even if it was built and made for 360/PS3.The AI is much improved over GRID 2 and the ""hard"" difficulties are actually a challenge for once. Codemasters said this was wheel to wheel racing and that it is. Before I dwell deeper into the review, here is a breakdown of the pros and cons IMO;+Graphics/Visuals+Sound+Presentation+Multiple Disciplines+Teammate-Forced Drifting-Upgrade System-Teammate (yes both a pro and a con)-Lack of detailed in-car cockpit view -Forced to play all disciplines-Some disciplines not as well done as others-Lacking car selection-Team OffersOne of the stand out negatives you will be faced with, is the fact you are forced to play all disciplines and some of those disciplines are clearly inferior to others. Open Wheel, Street and Touring are very well done and thought out. However Tuner and Endurance is a joke. Tuner would of been great, if it wasn't the one buzz kill and sole aspect that completely ruins the discipline and that is drifting. Drifting in this game, as most other games that incorporate it are utter trash and more work than it needs to be. Codemasters stated that GAS was ""bringing racing and the series back to its roots"". However, drifting is not grass roots racing, nor is it really racing at all. It is an extreme niche and is more of an art form then racing, and should of either been taken out completely or been an optional DLC add-on like Drag Racing is. I liked Drifting, 10 years ago when it was a fad....Some other notable negatives to touch on is the team mate mechanic. Though the presentation and potential is there, the execution is not. Not sure what the point of them really are, as more often than not, they suck and almost always bring your team rating down. They give you the option to assign various driving mechanics to them while racing like HOLD, PUSH and ATTACK, but I’ve found that none of the settings really matter and even on PUSH and ATTACK setting they still more often than not, drop back in the pack. I hope they expand more on this in later titles and have more customization for the player to fine tune teammate(s).The last thing I want to mention are the team offers and upgrades. Team offers are somewhat pointless as the only differences between them are the level of tuning you can do, XP you can earn and simple pre-installed upgrades already applied to the team cars. Why offer any type of ""upgrade"" mechanic if the player has no control over them, other than to take them off? Better teams have more upgrades pre-installed, but it's a roll of the dice on which ones you get and it seems to be based on what difficulty you had set the previous championship. i.e. you have better team offers and pre-installed upgrades the higher you set the difficulty,  which this alone is counter-productive. I always tend to set my racing games to the hardest they can be, but I am not everyone.All in all though this is a great game. By no means is this a racing simulator, but I would rank it up with Shift and Shift 2 as not a full on sim, but not a full on arcade racer either. Though at least with Shift 2 you have an upgrade system lol.Stunning visuals and sound will leave you wanting more. Plenty of real world tracks and rendered cities to race in with a mediocre amount of cars, but good enough selection, though some choice as to what cars we race in would been better.In the end I give this a 7 /10 ",82,4,11,24,13,0,11

												OK So I am a GRID tragic, I played the first GRID right through career multiple times, got to Legend status online then started again multiple times, and thought there would never be as fun a simcade as GRID. So I had high hopes for GRID 2, eagerly awaited it while still churning out laps on GRID. GRID 2, put simply, was an abomination that Codemasters should be ashamed of. But then, to atone for their sins, along came GRID Autosport.It is everything GRID 2 should have been. I feel like Codies made this game purely to make up for the god awful retch of a game that was GRID 2. But Autosport delivers the original GRID experience, but expands upon it in so many new ways. Better models, tracks, detail, and racing. It is deep, challenging, and fun. I am playing through Career on Hard and though I get the odd win here and there, it is a struggle. Which means the learning curve and difficulty is almost spot on. The AI does not race like real racers do, however. They are way too aggressive, if you are on the racing line and ahead of them, they will hit you every time to put themselves on the racing line, often taking you out. It is a robotic AI, not so much a 'real racing' AI. But you have flashback, and once you become aware of how the AI drives and corners, you can work with it. It's not so bad as to become a real problem, plus as with all racing games, you can ALWAYS OUTBRAKE THE AI. I would love to find a racing game one day, where the AI throws caution to the wind and overtakes under brakes more aggressively than a human can. As with GRID Autosport, like most other racing games,  the game is won and lost in the corners, and who can outbrake the best. Once day, a racing game will realise this - and adjust to the way a human drives - or at least, combat outbraking by outmanoevering or using [prediction, as a real human racer does. But all in all... I love GRID Autosport. I use a Hyperdrive ockpit and Logitech MOMO Force wheel and pedals. Sometimes I will even put my motorbike helmet and gloves on to race. I'm that much of an e-racing Nerd. But I don't care. Thanks Codemasters, for delivering on the GRID Legacy. Just a shame you didn't also deliver it to next gen consoles.  Cause in a month or two, it's gonna be all about Project Cars and the Legacy of GRID will fade again. Until then, I'm still a Legend in my own Garage.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best [of the newest] racing games on the market. Has a nice mix of both arcade and simulation racing styles, mixes them together well. My only few problems with this game is how they have removed the option to create your own team in career mode, and you can only do this in multiplayer - which just insn't enough in my opinion. Also, dashcam/first person is absolutely awful.Other than that, a great racing game. In short, it's better than GRID 2 but not as good as GRID 1. More or less what I expected.7.5/10 - great fun none the less. Would recommend over other racing games on the market.			",80,15,9,6,14,0,7

												The game looks good cars handles well, my wheel drive force pro it instantly reconised and was easy to setup and customise, where the game fell short is the Ai and optimisation, Ai is a bit stupid and tend to follow its path (not finding it ) they push you aggresively in the tarmac if u get in their way wich tend to happen all the time since it is a race!it it true that my rig is very old, but i manage to run some similar games with ease, my gpu crash after 2 races often, even at the lowest setting possible, i know there is a handfull of cars in the race 16-20 to render but it seems like every car is a standalone object , even if they look the same and drive the same ( dunno if devs use instances). last, the cockpits views are just horrible. as for the multiplayer , did nt got the time to test it, not really a fan of having a bsod every now and then, and restart my pc. overall i recommand the game but only if u have the recommanded requirements, and certainly at a sale, definitely not worth the full price.

												I have to say this is one of the most fun racing games I have ever played (i've also played F1 and rally games). There are five disciplines to play, to provide quite a nice varriety of racing types. But what I like the most, and makes the game fun is the AI. The AI is very competitive, but acts somewhat human and not mechanical, it blocks when you try to overtake, goes for the inside when it's overtaking. It is also prone to mistakes. I've seen many times cars flip over, colliding between them allowing you to pass past them. I've read some people complining that the AI is to aggresive, and they are somewhat right, but that's how this kind of racing are. The AI is not that agressive that it's oblivious to you, but they do try to bump you of the road. I think CM have found a good balance for the AI. One other thing I like is night racing. Sepang or Circuit of the Americas is amazing at night. The game is not perfect, the tracks tend to repeat themselves, but there are enough not to get boring, and also there's not a huge selection of cars, but again there is enough so to give you plenty of hours to try them all. 30 hours in and I have still not played all the tracks and all the cars. Another complaint by a lot of players is the interior cam, which looks poor and is barely usefull, but it didn't stop me from enjoying this game so much. I suggest that if you like racing games, you owe it to yourself to play this game. It's one of the best.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												GRID Autosport > GRIDGRID Autosport > GRID 2GRID > GRID 2This is a proper Arcade Simulator from Codemasters. This game has proper handling, unlike the handling in GRID 2 which caused you to drift into every corner, and high tier cars were just uncontrollable. This is not a simulator like NFS Shift 2 or Project CARS for that matter, but you can get it very close to those. I do love the new championship mode, it is much more fun than before. I have no idea why so many people hate this game, perhaps because they suck at it, you actually have to break before entering the corner, not drift into it. Think of this game as a step-down from F1. I would definitely recommend this game over GRID and GRID 2.			",15,2,13,0,3,0,8

												Great game!Highly recommended by me! The point of the game is to win the race, earn money, buy new cars win races and etc. The multiplayer functionality works amazing! A downside is the interior view. It is blurred. They apparently blurred it so that when you race all you see is out the window and not the car. This is very good concept but it failed. Even when the car is stationary the interior is out of focus. The sad part is that they did spend time making the interior as it is HD from outside. I would have thought that because it failed they would remove it so that I would want to play First Person. Now I just use the hoods camera view instead.			",8,1,3,0,6,0,0

												GRID Autosport > GRIDGRID Autosport > GRID 2GRID > GRID 2This is a proper Arcade Simulator from Codemasters. This game has proper handling, unlike the handling in GRID 2 which caused you to drift into every corner, and high tier cars were just uncontrollable. This is not a simulator like NFS Shift 2 or Project CARS for that matter, but you can get it very close to those. I do love the new championship mode, it is much more fun than before. I have no idea why so many people hate this game, perhaps because they suck at it, you actually have to break before entering the corner, not drift into it. Think of this game as a step-down from F1. I would definitely recommend this game over GRID and GRID 2.			",15,2,13,0,3,0,8

												Overall rating: 8/10RACING:GRID Autosport is not at all like GRID 2. Drifting is slow where as a smooth and clean racing line gives you the fastest lap possible. The difficulty is perfect for me. I'm playing on the ""very hard"" difficulty and winning a race is really difficult which is why my win rate is like 15%. For me, this is great because winning feels like a great success and does not become normal.The AI fights with you around every corner. Oftentimes, they crash into me and all of a sudden I'm no longer 4th but last in the grid. That is very frustrating. Sometimes, it might be better not to fight too hard but just to let the faster car pass and savely drive at your pace. But fighting against the AI makes a lot of fun because they try not to let you pass and stuff.CAREER:The career is okay. It's dumb that you only earn XP. That way, you cannot really achieve anything. The only way you ""rank up"" is by getting XP and then competing in more advanced cups. Also, if you did good in a cup, team offers will change to more successful teams and the demands a team offers are higher.So actually, the only thing that I don't like about this game is that there is no real story to the career. But if you just want to race, it's a great game.I'm playing with a controller and it works just fine.			",4,0,1,1,1,0,0

												My experience with Autosport has been mixed, but mostly positive. On one hand, I enjoy the game. It's different than grid one and two being that it lacks customization and a sense of progression as a racing team. Rather, you're a driver for hire racing for multiple different teams. You don't buy your own cars, you don't customize them, you simply choose a contract and race a series for them. I can see how this would turn fans of the series off. However, the racing itself I found to be very well done and, despite some flaws, fun to play. It feels more like a racing sim such as project cars (albeit with assists and the signature rewind feature of Grid), yet still playable for casual fans of the genre and those looking for more of a easy-going racer. The thing I like about the racing is the ai. Whether you think it's good or bad ai, i still found it fun to play against. The reason being that the ai is more aggressive than a typical racing sim and thus leads to a more interesting experience. You find yourself dodging pile-ups, trying to powerslide around corners, and trying to avoid being taken out by opponents that are set on winning. That's a turn-off for some, so it's up to you whether you like that hectic style of racing. The game works great with my cheapo thrustmaster wheel, so I assume if you have a racing wheel it won't have much problem calibrating with it. The game is also optimized very well, and being that it's made for intel cards I assume it'll be perfectly playable on a standard computer without a dedicated GPU like Nvidia or Radeon. However, my particular model of GPU (Nvidia gtx 860m) gave me some issues with the game, which I suspect were from the windows 10 upgrade since it worked fine on windows 8. The game would crash after 15 minutes of gameplay on the nose with no error message. Apparently this is a somewhat common issue among Nvidia users. This problem never resolved itself until eventually I got a new computer with a 960m. If you have an 860m and run windows 10, be careful.If I were to rate this game out of 10, I'd say it deserves 7/10. It leaves a lot to be desired for hardcore Grid fans, yet might be exactly what you want for others. I for one enjoyed it for what it was.			",121,9,8,9,7,0,21

												If you're expecting a realistic racing simulator, or a relaxing experience, go elsewhere.Grid Autosport is very arcade-y, the career mode is well set up, and it's great fun to pick up and play, but it's not a detailed racing game for detailed racing game fans.The AI is absolutely crazy, full throttle full contact crazy. If you're on the racing line and they want to be on the racing line, you're going to have a bad time.The only way to get ahead is by forcing your way through. You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.All in all, a good fun game to play, but not for the serious racing game enthusiast.			",27,0,3,7,12,0,3

												Ok. Look, here's how it is. Grid autosport is a beautifal game. The racing is pretty fun and more challenging than I was expecting, which is good. Unlike most games you aren't expected to win first every time and 4th-8th is acceptable for most starting racing contracts. You start off racing small class c touring cars so Ford Focus, Honda Civics and the like and then proceed into other classes. I haven't got to them all so I won't comment on that. I guarantee one of the ones around this will have.And whilst the UI is beautifal and well the whole game is beautifal, this WHOLE game feels like an after thought. I mean for starters when I first opened the game it felt empty, something was missing. I don't know what to say about it really. It lacks immersion maybe? And one of the most shocking things out of the box was that you HAD TO MAP IN XBOX 360 CONTROLS! WTF CODEMASTERS!!Instead of a cockpit you have the cockpit kind of blurred out, and it's modelled horribly in there. No dials in there work etc. Honestly one of the worst things I have ever seen and I want to slap whoever at codemasters thought that was ok. Because it isn't. It gives a nice effect I get that, but at the same time it is horrible and i hope i never see it in a game EVER again. THAT is one of the biggest gripes I have ever had with a game.Apart from that it's pretty good, and seems to be sponsored by Intel HD Graphics weirdly enough so i am curious to see how well it might run on my new macbook air (in bootcamp obvs). Should you get this game though... well here's how I am going to lay this out. If you play A LOT of racing games you probably won't have an issue here. If you're like me who plays them occasionally you might enjoy it. If you like forza motorsport 4 and 5 well you will enjoy it but you cannot mess around and tune stock cars as much as you can on forza. This game needs to be taken seriously. And finally if you want this game as kind of SERIOUS simulator like i did save your money for project cars or assetto corsa. Don't get me wrong this is a nice game, but for some reason it's just not completely for me. No game has really come out for PC with the kind of arcade / simulation style of Gran Turismo and Forza and thats really starting to bug me. I like forza because if i dont want to play career mode, i can just buy cars, tune them and play online and set insane lap times (1.11.459 around top gear test track nissan GT-R, 7:49 nurburgring). Which is great because forza's career mode takes hundreds of hours to do, and I don't have that time. After all this though do I recommend it... Well... If you can deal with the crap I talked about then yes. Else, save your money. ",57,7,6,4,17,1,3

												8 out of 10Grid Autosport is a great return to series roots with much improved graphics and sound then other versions. featuring over 100 cars to choose from (including DLC), from cars like Nissan Skyline, Honda Civic, Mini Cooper through to the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 super sport, Lola B12/80, and the GT40 mk1 spanning several motorsport types from touring car, tuner, endurance (the races aren't that long), open wheel, street racing and party mode (which is basically demolition derby). from those modes they are split into different race modes including drift, JDM, unofficial V8 Supercars (Super Tourers) using only the VF Commodore and FG Falcon and unofficial Indy Car series (Formula A) using the  Dallara DW12 chassis.With 28 locations and 130 track layouts from street circuits and closed racing circuits (real and fiction) to choose from including, Spa-Francorchamps, Brands Hatch, Mount Panorama and Indianapolis. Also featuring day and night racing (night racing on selected tracks only). Unfortunately there is no Nurburgring or Circuit De La Sarthe.Features a new and improved damage system, enhanced physics and flashbacks. It is an overall solid action racing game but is still lacking in great and important features that would greatly improve the series like better AI, pit stops, dynamic weather, dynamic time of day change, rally racing, longer races and get rid of that dam cockpit blur. Overall I give it 8 out of 10 for the great graphics, car selection and the replay value.			",255,37,24,26,30,2,16

												Codemasters have done something good with this game. The tracks, the cars, the gameplay - all great.The different classes of race and cups, the simple increase of level of each class and the selection of sponsors give this game a good linear direction. Something which was missing in Grid 2, which was all over the place like a crazy woman's makeup.The upgrades on the cars are a bit restrictive, as it the setup on some sponsor cars, but having no control over that makes for good playability as you need to adjust your driving style for the car. And I like that.Graphics are nice maxed out, some dodgy 8-bit styling coming from building reflections on the cars.. But that's really just nit-picking. The engine seems to be a lot more polished and infinitely more optomised. A massive step up from G2.Where the game falls down are, in my opinion, the strength of team mates and the audible names. 3rd generation of Grid should at least have more names than the first. I mean there are completely bizarre names on there, but Doug is still left out! *huffs*All in all a great little game from Codemasters, but I just can't understand why they made this a full product and not just an epic DLC for Grid 2.

												I was surprised at how decent this was. Looks great, sounds good, and actually plays really well once you get used to the new handling physics. Handles more like Gran Turismo 4 than it does the original GRID, but that's not a bad thing, it's just different. My primary complaint is that all variations of every track are not open to every class of car in time trials. You can only drive hatchbacks on the Okutama Sprint Circuit, for instance. The Grand Circuit is not an option. The menus are nice and sleek, too. I'd rarely make a point of that sort of thing, but it impressed me a lot for some reason.It's a good game. So far, everything I've driven has been fun to drive, from Open Wheel, to Street, to Tuner, which I can't say for the original GRID (some of the EU and US events weren't very good). Just don't go into it expecting something which is exactly the same as GRID 2, or something that behaves like a proper simulator.			",117,13,3,17,3,0,24

												Purchased this game because it is available for Linux.   I have owned  and played Codemasters games (Dirt and others) in the past and was quite impressed, so my expectations were quite high...  Installation went well on Ubuntu 14.04LTS (Specs: I3, 3Ghz, 16GB RAM, nVidia GTX250 ""Dark Knight"" 1GB). nVidia 340 proprietary driver.Game started fine and I was able to access options menu and configure my Logitech G25 wheel.   BONUS! Started the first race with great expectations.....   Oops.   Black screen.   Sounds in background....  Crash. After some messing around,  managed to get the game working in very basic graphics mode using open source Linux driver.....  Game plays with minimal graphics at~40fps....Love the game,  but obviously the graphics need fixing on Linux.Later Edit:  Installed the game on a better computer (i7, 930, 2.8Ghz, 12GB DDR 1600 RAM, nVidia Gforce GTX 760 & nVidia Linux driver) and it runs very well.  Still can't run it on the highest graphics settings but am getting ~50 -60 fps on high.The good stuff:I like the variety of races, tracks and cars.  I like the idea of being offered a contract to drive for various teams and even though the choice is limited (2 teams at a time), but this is mostly a good thing as it makes the choice easy.  I like the graphics effects, dust, smoke, car parts flying around....  etc.  I prefer to use the internal camera view and like that there are two options.  Others have commented on the quality of the internal dash graphics but I can appreciate that if you are focussed on the road ahead, the dash would be out of focus and is not important anyway....  so it works for me.As mentioned above, my Logitech G25 is recognised and works well, including Force Feedback (a big plus on Linux!)...  more on this below.The not so good stuff:The AI drivers are very aggressive.  I have fought to gain a respectable position near, or at the front of the pack, only to be shunted out of the way on the last lap with no way to catch up again..... Frustrating!  Put it this way, if I ran a club and other members of that club drove the way the AI do in this game, I would kick them out of the club!I know there is a flasback option but I find myself using this more to 'correct' problems with aggressive AI behaviour than I do to fix my own mistakes.The game (Linux version) does not store or remember my Wheel settings, so I have to go in an reset everything everytime I start the game.   There is a preset option for Logitech G25 but it is all wrong for my setup?  OVERALL:I recommend the game to anyone who enjoys racing without the extensive tuning and tweaking required by some other racing games.  Just jump in a go.Be prepared to fight to gain and hold your postion.   The AI play rough!It works well on Ubuntu 14.04 (with appropriate hardware)....			",0,0,1,0,3,0,0

YAS Marina, COTA, Mt Tremblant, Istanbul park and more! i would have a few hundred more hours logged but this is the second time i purchased. played through it first on xbox 360. no replacement for tri screen Surround gaming on PC!!

												#dataloadfailedThis is an outrage!I truly enjoy this game, the graphics are amazing and even though I prefer Kirk Thornton's voiceover from the original Race Driver: GRID, still is an enjoyable experience. This isn't why I write this review.Why the hell can't we have normal savegames that don't break?! I had 30-something hours in my previous profile, that got corrupted. I said alright, it happens. Now I'm at 78 hours into the game, and all is wasted yet again! ""Data load failed.""This isn't right at all.EDIT:After hours of research, I found no clue other than disabling Steam Cloud altogether and backing up the saves manually. I've always been a fan of Codemasters Racing, but this is no reason for that. The first GRID is.			",91,9,17,4,3,0,2

												If you really MUST pick one between Grid Autosport and Grid 2, go for Autosport to avoid all those pile of SHXT arcade drifts.IN TRUTH THOUGH, even Autosport has less realistic handling physics than GRID 1 (acceleration/braking is better in AS though, without being exaggerated). Handling in GRID 1 was so good that it could rival the top ultimate sim games (e.g. rFactor) in not all but at least few aspects (despite it was never meant to be full-sim).  GRID AS, despite its richer content, failed to recapture the handling magic of GRID 1, and the driving experience is too detached and easy(simplified) in typical modern Codemasters way. (same for Dirt RALLY, yes people gonna hate me for saying this but it's FACT).IF SIM is what you have in mind, FORGET AUTOSPORT. At least GRID 1 one aspect close to sim level which makes it worth considering, but AS doesn't. I'm still waiting for GRID 1 v2 dear Codemasters.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Grid series is about fun. I haven't decided if Autosport is better than the original, but it's doing it right. The AI does some wonky things from time to time, but so do actual dumb people online. Where it counts, though, the Grid series is really satisfying.Grid—1, 2, and Autosport (among other Codemasters games)—are enjoyable, challenging, and compelling. That's what I'm looking for.

												GRID Autosport is by far the best racing game i've played. What I liked about the game:---------------------------------------The graphics are stunning, and can definetly be deemed as the best graphics to currently be implemented into a racing game. (Just don't open the car doors and you'll be fine!) -The sound is sharp and realistic, and really makes the game that much more enjoyable to play.-Multiplayer is a blast, and I have made alot of friends and had alot of fun in the meantime. Just watch out for drivers that don't know how to use the breaks when reaching corners.-The singleplayer/campaign is recommended by me as it gets you to grips with the game, and gives you an experience that you will never forget! Heres some tips for those critics out there:---------------------------------------------------------Don't like the interior ""blurry"" view? Don't use the interior camera then.Don't like the game overall? Go complain to a community that actually cares and go back to playing Mario Kart. WE LOVE AUTOSPORT! <3  Honestly I love this game, and I can't wait to see what else Codemasters brings us in the near future.			",108,7,10,13,6,1,2

												I like this game. First, I'm so exited that i can finaly tune my car! My favorite type of race in the game is the Street Race and after the Touring race, and I find these twe the most exiting part of the game! The gameplay is very good and compined with the tuning part it's getting even better. I would be happy if there was a way to do my one team later on the career instead of racing always for other teams. One thing that i don't like it's the way that the replay shows too much copkit view, the hud view and the rear spoiler and it shows less from a view that you can see the whole car and the other cars around you! Also, I really think it should have more manufactures and more cars like Subaru Impreza WRX STI, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, Porsche, Lamborghini, Toyota Supra, newer models of Camaro and Corvette, Haven't played much multiplayer yet so I can't say much but all the times i had played with others there was no lag and we were more that 10 people in one race! I personaly believe this game is worthy and it's a very good racing game but always alla of us willl have something that we don't like in any game like i mentioned before the things i don't like and the things i like!

												ok, this is not an average review. i will not mention other grid titles. i am reviewing this game as a game in its own right. this game is not a simulator. if you want a sim get a sim. this isn't an arcade racer though either. it cuts a happy medium. the handling is somehwre between assetto corsa and nfs: shift2 unleashed. its very accessible, but very rewarding and has subtleties and nuances that will have you clenching♥♥♥♥♥cheeks and leaning in your chair. the racing is great. the AI isn't bad. a bit ruthless at times, but then so are you. the amount of different races is fantastic. plenty to do. the graphics are excellent, and it runs really well. no hitching or stuttering. no obvious glitches. menu system is great. joypad integration is faultless, and the cars handle perfectly well without having to fiddle with deadzones and gamma. you'll see no twitchy driver hands here thankyou assetto corsa. the cockpit view which seems in contention is fine. press the view button enough times and you get a set back view where you can see the steering wheel. its fine. overall i would rate this game a 9 out of 10.

To the people that complain about the driving mechanics and the poor quality of interior views - youre wrong. That's all I have to say! Great game, physics are well done and work to replicate realistic high-performance driving, and the interiors work because youre focusing on where your car is going, not whats on your dash. Good job Codemasters!			",131,4,4,16,9,0,29

												It's a very good game indeed, not worth 50€ though, maybe 35€ or 40€.The stupid drifts from GRID 2 are gone! (Yeeaah!)This game is now closer to the good old GRID, but forget the handbrake lad, you won't be using it as you would on GRID :)GRID Autosport's assist are VERY well done, in my opinion. The old GRID assists would allow you do ""derp"" around with the handbrake, allowing you to go into a corner at full speed and just go around it with a perfect powerslide.Now Autosport's assists are an ""assist"". They don't give you the power to ""derp"" around and win, but they limit your car, in a way newer drivers would be able to feel how the game is, and drive around, but not to get good lap times.When you get rid of those assists (don't get off ABS so soon though :) ) you'll be able to really get into Hot Lapping, and getting the drifty feel around a corner and therefore going around it faster.ABS should be the last assist to get rid of. Why? After letting your car oversteer all it wants, getting the brakes to lock isn't a very good idea, so, get those oversteers controlled, and then you can get into the brake locking, and being your own ABS.Without ABS you'll be able to lose speed faster on a smaller amount of space, and time, therefore improving your lap times.Now, let's get into the game, not the driving itself.The career, I found it a bit boring, but that's because of another factor we'll talk about later, and you won't be able to make your own livery ( :( ), but you'll be able to race with real sponsors, and choose the one that you want to race with.Each sponsor can have a different car, but they have different rewards on XP. You won't need to buy a car, since the sponsor gives you one, or several if other vehicle is needed on the event.Sponsors also give you different possibilities in terms of vehicle setup and parts to install to improve your car's performance.Okay, I said the career was a bit boring because of the... Car color :( Nah, the Artificial Intelligence (A.K.A. AI).This is where the juice gets sour.The AI is a bit dumb, let's say. I've only raced it on very hard, but I think they act the pretty same on the other difficulties.I've experienced ramming, pushing you out of the track (into the grass, dirt, W/E), dumb lines on corners, and other ""derpy"" movement.The AI is VERY aggressive but at the same time dumb and suicidal (who knows why...).On the first races I had I found it very hard to get past the Ravenwest guys, their cars are a bit overpowered comparing to yours, and if you don't get them at the correct time, you'll have a VERY hard time, or you'll even lose the race.AI fails reacting to braking, even to other AI driver's braking, and it's a damn ramfest at the first corner.Once I saw a Focus Touring car at the Hockenheimring just going straight past a hairpin, and flipping on the gravel (spooky).So, biggest fail? AI, definitely.About the online.Now, here starts the fun. Racing people worldwide! Now that's amazing :)I'm a HUGE fan of online racing, but not on Sim Racing games, GRID Autosport IS NOT A SIM, it's a sim/arcade as people would call it, and this game fits me perfectly!They have done a really good thing, so you can point out who's a rammer, and who's going to keep their line and race with the minimum contact possible.Followed by the online name of the player, comes a plain circle with an exclamation mark in it.It goes from Orange to White and can have 4 colors.Orange - Avoid this guy!Yellow - Contact is commonGreen - Contact is possibleWhite - Contact is avoidedYou'll start with a yellow circle, but don't worry, you'll get that to green or white in no time, if you race properly :) (Not like the A.I. ^^ )I've experienced some lags, like ramming the guy that was in front of me, but I didn't even touch him, but hopefully that's going to be fixed, also my connection isn't a big deal.Now, on the online you can create your own ""Club"", and people can apply to join it.You can create your own livery for your club, just like how it was on GRID 2 :) You can change and paint wheels as well.But, you'll have to buy your own cars. Don't worry if you don't have it, you'll be able to race anyways, but with a car that isn't your, therefore you can't change it's setup, install parts or repair it. (We'll get there very soon :) )When you buy your car you'll be able to level it up, and higher the level, you start unlocking setup packages, that allow you to change your car's setup. The higher the package, more freedom on setting it up. Level also unlocks parts to improve your car's performance, but everything will cost you GRID $, but not that much, a race or two can pay those :)After a race, you'll have to repair your car, because it was worn. It's called condition, and it's measured in percentage, the higher the percentage is, the best the car will react on an impact (more durable), and better it's performance, so keep it always on the 100% :)The online prices are very good and equilibrated, you can also buy used cars, that are cheaper, but they have more mileage, and more mileage means the more expensive the car is to repair after it being used.I've never bought a used car, always stuck to newer ones, because on the long-run you'll save more money.Used cars are more for flash using, let's say.TO SUM UP!What a huge review, huh :D-A bit overpriced, probably less 10€ would be it's price, but we don't know what's behind the making of the game.-Assist system is very well done, a newbie driver will feel safe driving on this game, but won't be faster than someone without assists.-AI is a bit dumb and aggressive.-Online is very well done and promotes fair-play.-I recommend this game, but probably you should wait for a discount.Hope it helped :)			",51,12,10,3,4,1,2

												Grid Autosport...I've got this game with my Intel I7 4790k... looks good , runs good but loads of problemsThe AI ... as many other reviews have stated ... well , its not bad but its not great either , if you get in the lead , on higher dificulties , the ai will start smashing into you breaking your car , while it doesn't take any damage.One major surprise i've had with this game is the awful textures. The spectators are sometimes zoomed on when you finish the race and god , did those PS2 graphics give me nightmares. And one extremely important thing that a '' profesional '' racer must have?  Well , if you're gonna include a 1st person view god f-in dammit include some hi-res steering wheel and speed meter textures? NO , of course , just more PS2 graphics , blurry as hell...My verdict? Well if youre looking for a WAY CHEAPER AND BETTER alternative try Colin McRae's Dirt games. Way better AI and racing overall....ALSO THIS HAS AN EXTREMELY BAD DLC BUISSNIES MODEL , STAY AWAY FROM ITI cannot recommend this game to any racing game fan!			",105,10,3,15,9,0,20

												Picked this up in a sale a while ago and have started a new career 3 times now. Initially I had constant crashes and could only play 2 races at a time which corrupted my save data. Now I have had an error (which appears to be common online) that appears to be Windows 10 related: The game does not start unless Steam is asked to verify the integrity of local content before lauching. However, this has now corrupted my save data again.Buggy mess with Windows 10. I won't be trying to play this anymore.Shame because I loved the original Racedriver: Grid and was looking forward to getting my teeth back into one of these games.			",63,13,3,6,9,1,19

												Great game yes it's cockpit view is well thats not comment there... but still a great game, the rating system rocks so you know whos a bad guy online and whos nice.So much in this game even in single player it will take ages to complete, but there is lots to do.Online can be a bit shocking at first as you do get a lot of idiots but this game as so many different types of racing its great for league to create championships just like Nebula Racing is doing this, were starting a touring car championship and can not wait to start.with so many different classes it can be hard to find a race but then its easy to get your friends to join.Clubs is also a great add to the game it just no many people know how to apply the club liverys as you need to own the car firstly but yes the more you race with the club livery the high in rank the club goes on race net which is great.in all i say its a great gamejust cant wait for the dlc packs to come out its worth buying the season pass as it will work out cheaper in the long run.

												Short version: GRID Autosport is a fun and enjoyable game; it has its flaws and little problems, but overall it's a very good experience and I recommend it.Now for the whole review: in my opinion Autosport is what Grid 2 should have been. The game takes as its inspiration mostly the first Grid, with some features and ideas taken from the sequel and some new things to complete it.GRAPHICS: G:A uses (again) the Ego engine. In my opinion it works really fine, the graphics are still very nice (especially with the HD textures pack) but at the same time scalable and lightweight; I can play without problems on my not recent laptop on medium-high settings without any problems. Sometimes there's a little freeze of half a second (it seems a common issue regardless of the pc), but happens once every 5-6 races so it's not really a problem. There's the controversial point of the cockpit view: it makes its return from the absence of Grid 2, but we don't have the detailed cockpits of Grid; instead we have non-functional instruments (only the steering wheel turns), ""hidden"" by a blur filter. It's better than not having one, but it's quite disappointing (seeing also older games like Shift series having beautiful cockpits).DRIVING MODEL: it's known that the game doesn't aim to be a simulator. The game tries to be halfway between an arcade and a simulator, and in my opinion succeeds. The game is accessible enough, with a lot of driving aids like traction control, ABS, racing line, etc. but with all deactivated races become challenging enough without the ""frustration"" of a simulator. Clean driving and racing lines will net you good times, and the Grid 2 drifting is completely gone. Sometimes the car behaves a little strangely (from a realistic point of view), but it's natural in the game's system.SINGLE PLAYER CAREER: one of the most disappointing things of the game in my opinion. The scheme is: you have 5 disciplines to choose from, every championship won will make you level up and unlock more championships of the same discipline. But there's no other progress: you always drive as a hired driver and won't create your own team. There's no money earning nor car customization - you simply choose a championship, one from the teams that offer you a car and race. Honestly you can do exactly the same by playing custom cups, with the execption that everything's unlocked from the start.MULTIPLAYER: the real strong point of the game. As in the single player, there are 5 categories of racing (Touring, Open Wheel, Endurance, Tuned, Street). When you decide to go online, you can create or join a custom cup (which specifies the events, tracks, cars, etc.) or jump onto a default playlist, which spawns across the various cars and tracks available in the discipline. When you play online you can use rental cars or buy your own with the money earned from racing. The advantage of using your own cars is that everyone has its own ""level"" and gaining experience will unlock you upgrades, but only for the SPECIFIC car. So even if someone played 200 hours but never touched, for example, touring cars he won't have any upgrade available - and you can see that because there are 5 separated experience levels for the player, one for each discipline. You can create or join clubs, customize your liveries and so on. The races are really smooth and there's rarely lag. For me the multiplayer is a really good point.So, to summarize, this game feels like the ""real GRID2"", it's the sequel of Grid. The average review scores are derived by the fact that this game has nothing ""extraordinary"" with respect to Grid 2, it seems like that Codemasters acknowledged their mistake with the second game and made this to return on track. It has many tracks and cars, it's a great experience, but if you were burned by Grid 2 you will be pleased by the return to the roots of the series. It's worth its price, but you can feel ""cheated"" by this game that should've been released years ago with the name Grid 2. In this case, it's better to wait for a discount before buying it. For the others, it's one of the best racing games of its genre, and it's still recommended for everyone, especially if you plan to play online!			",112,8,21,17,5,0,17

												I really legitimately wanted to enjoy this game. But in all honesty, I feel like it's just the maps lifted from Grid 2 with a Grid 1 kinda-season on it that doesn't even match what Grid 1 actually had. I only really found two of the racing types actually fun- some just feel bad to control. Endurance racing is the worst- why have tire wear only in one game mode, which you then can do nothing about because there's no pit stops? Those are kind of important in endurance racing.In a word, Argh. Codemasters continues a slow, sad slide.			",111,14,9,22,40,2,58

												The game is a lot of fun, when it comes to the realism, and is in many ways similar to Grid. Grid though, is somewhat old now, but believe it or not, the AI worked pretty well in the first game. In Grid autosport, that is not the case, they have somehow gotten worse. The AI takes no account for you being on the track too, AT ALL. The game is a lot of fun, when playing against players, but when I bought this game I had hoped singleplayer would be just as fun, maybe even better then the first one, which had me entertained for a very long time. The way the difficulty works in this game, isn't how good the AI is at driving, which it should be, when you turn up the difficulty, their cars are simply faster than your car, and impacts doesn't throw them off course, which it most certainly does to the player. I can only hope, since this is a fairly new game, that these things are problems they will be fixed through updates, this game could be so much more fun, and it would be a shame for this game to never reach the same level as the first Grid, because if not, this will be the last Grid game we might ever see, since no one can afford to very bad games in a row.

												Grid Autosport is tantalizingly close to being great. All the ingredients are there. Impressive technical competency, a large amount of content, outstanding attention to detail in graphics & audio. But it fails at the fundamentals. The driving just isn’t as fun and interesting as it is in Gran Turismo or Forza.In order to make a track racing game interesting over the long haul, the tiniest details need to be just right. Not only does the underlying physics model need to be complex, but it needs to be communicated to the player just right so they can instinctively feel what’s going on. The camera angle plays a huge part in this, which is easy to demonstrate in Gran Turismo. In Gran Turismo the bumper cam is the defacto way to play the game. The alternative angles, like behind the car, are all hilariously awful in execution. You can’t see properly where you’re going, it’s completely stiff in an almost unnerving way. When you use the bumper cam you can see the car rearing back, diving forwards, tilting to the sides, all in subtle ways which tell you how stable the car is, or if you’re about to spin out etc.Grid Autosport feels simplistic. It isn’t complex enough, it’s too smooth. It’s almost hard to nail down exactly what it does wrong, because there’s plenty of great arcade racing games which aren’t boring. They’re usually much faster than Grid Autosport. Like the original Grid which met criticism from simulator fans who thought it felt like a racing sim sped up to 200% speed. I loved that aspect of it! When you drive down the same tracks in Grid Autosport at a more realistic speed, you’re given time to reflect on how nothing interesting is going on in the game. In Gran Turismo it’s engaging to drive slow piece of crap cars thanks to the exceptional feel of the physics. In Grid Autosport I’m struggling to be excited about the fastest cars in the world.The career mode in Grid Autosport is easily 50+ hours long, and I will never finish it. The game isn’t good enough to hold my interest. When I first got the game I played it a lot. Now I fire it up once a month and play it for a hour or two. That’s the level of engagement I get from it. And that’s fine! It has its merits, which make it a nice experience. But when their novelty fades, you’re left with only the underlying game to carry it. That’s where it fails.Despite this, I’m recommending it. It’s ok! Good enough to grab on sale. The first 10 hours or so are great. It’s only after that the tedium hits you like a ton of bricks.

												I was dithering between Grid 2 and this for a further Grid fix and I'm regretting it. My main issue is the agonising amount of repetition. In a drift event you're doing the same course 8 bleedin' times in a row. I was under the impression that games were supposed to be fun. This is a relentless grind that makes me sad. Looks great, some nice cars but I can't believe the designers thought players would enjoy something that forces them to do the same thing over and over and over again.			",4,0,3,0,2,0,0

												I've played quite a few hours of grid 2, and really enjoy the gameplay. When autosport came out, my friends and I decided to get it assuming it would be a better upgrade to grid 2. However, autosport is a lot more simulation than it's predecessor, so driving 'seems' to be alot tougher, and cars seem to skid alot more when turning corners, forcing you to slow down a lot unlike grid 2 where you can at least drift around corners. Thus I prefer grid 2 gameplay a lot more, and have found that I wasted my money with this game.			",98,5,5,8,6,1,33

												Unlike the other games in the GRID series, this one has no fun customization, no team management and worse of all; NO proper randomization of starting position on the grid. Being put dead last in a race is a huge killer om my nerves. **** that. And the AI is... weird. The difficulty settings seems to only adjust their aggressiveness. That means that when you start the race, you have to drive like a madman to the front of the pack, and suddenly you find yourself stuck behind a pair of AI who drive fairly orderly, but fast as hell. You end up with position 6, your teammate at 14 and you hate the setup.The positive things are easily numbered. The graphics are great, the driving experience is great, the in-race ""interactive"" voices and team member orders... well that's about it. This game supremely♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. I played GRID 1 like a fanatic. I loved it. Grid 2 was also great. But this... this is several steps back in the ****** wrong direction.

The Good Physics improved a lot. Now actually have to break. Car suspension is not made of cheese anymore. Well optimized. Will run on mid, low-end pc`s as well. Looks fine. Actual racing tracks. Long career mode.  Ravenwest do not use ""Catch up"" system anymore.  Cars handle very nice. Each have unique characteristic. Game uses both screens!!!!! Game on first, tv cam and real-time standings table on the other! Most awesome feature of the game.  Racenet race clubs are nice feature. You can make your own teams and team colors for cars to race online. Tons of things to do. Long single player career, splitscreen, sort of online career mode with online garage and leveling, like in GRID 2.  Online racing still very fun, when you can find actual people to race with. (! Online TIP  - in Europe set Steam download location to UK, to find lot more people to play with... go figure, but it works! ) Sound effects are on Battlefield level. This was one of the biggest surprises. Sound is just ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.  AI is aggressive and not affraid to fight for position unlike any other racing game. On highest difficulty modes even challenging. Some of the best AI I`ve seen in racing games lately.  Plays very nice. driving itself is fun. Still very arcadey, but improved a lot. Cars actually feel somewhat like cars with weight. Gameplay fluid, snappy, quick jump-in. Technically well done, feels finished. The Bad Multiplayer full of cheaters again. ""Over the white lines"" penalty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is more annoying than ever. Succeeds at punishing for normal racing and ignoring obvious corner cutting as long as you release throttle.  Drifting is not racing!!! You will drift the ♥♥♥♥ out of championships to open higher tier races in career. You cannot just do single racing type to advance. Choose what you like, but you`ll have to drive them all! Collision detection system still broken and exploited in online races. Do not prevent MP griefing at all.  You can buy cars on online career, but you have very limited garage space. Each car have separate levels you need to unlock upgrades and even car setup, but cars are separate in million different categories with only  1-4 vehicles in each. And you will need a lot of cars to race and level your own not loaned ones.  A lot of content are recycled from GRID 2.  Too many levels in online mode. Racing category levels, car levels, main character levels, I`m just confused and don`t understand how to keep track on all of it.  No pitstops in endurance races. Tyre deterioration not really influanced by your driving style, but more by how far you are in a race. Feels pointless. No rain. No Mirrors ! Sponsors (provide XP) reward for doing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on qualifying. You won`t always get rewards if starting from 1st position.The Ugly Cockpit view. WTF Codies?7/10 ",346,80,39,37,30,3,57

												Pretty mediocre game all around, and a lot of the racing feels tedious and unengaging. The ""Endurance"" series is required if you want to progress in the game, and in that series tire wear is simulated, which is great, except the tires wear super fast, and the wear doesn't seem to affect the AI. Handling in other series' is dull, with the exception of the open wheel championships, which are probably the only series actually worth playing. I would only recommend buying this if the price is $5 or less.			",91,15,5,8,11,0,6

												I've been playing racing games on PC since the 90's and I have to say this one is the best I've ever played. It's forgiving enough that you're not constantly having to restart because something stupid happens. It's very playable with a gamepad. It has multiple racing disciplines which you can progress through independantly. The graphics are great, although the audience models look like they're from early 2000's.My favorite thing about this game is how accessible it is. You can make it whatever you want, it has time attacks where you can race against your own ghost car, it has muscle cars, tuner cars, open wheel, GT cars, supercars, whatever you're into.

												First off the AI in this game is horrible, I’m surprised they can even make it to the finish line. The AI is very aggressive and when the difficulty is turned up it seems to only make them more aggressive. If you are playing this game alone then I would still recommend this game but only on sale it but if you have a friend(s) and know how the AI plays the game becomes fun only because of how bad it is. I would only get this game if it is on sale or if you have someone to play with. 6/10Pros:Great soundGreat graphics (has a free 4k car texture pack)Beautiful tracksFun drifting (Hard AF though, at least for me)Cons:AI is just stupidYou lose money even driving clean racesNo cockpitKeyboard controls are horribleThis is a video that I recorded, I know I am not the best drive I was just having fun.

												A very solid racing game indeed. It comes highly recommended from me. Codemasters have been perfecting their racing games for many years and this one is perhaps the best, I think since TOCA 2. Brilliant car physics for both the open wheelers and the tin-tops. A great damage engine, the graphics are the best yet in the Grid series. If you like arcade style racing and or doing your car up with shiny decals and nos look elsewhere. This is a serious racing game. Not as serious as R Factor but it does suit someone that is a fan of motorsport and understands the sports subtleties. For me its a good thing, but for a NFS fan it might not be so. Although there is a nod to arcade racing with the 'tuner' and 'street' classes this Grid title also gives back more to the anoraks than previous incarnations.Where the game is a real winner in the longevity stakes; is the online mode. I have had some dramatic and close races online with some serious game racing competition, you are able to run nose to tail and dice to the flag.The AI are pretty good. Probably one of the best AI in a racing game although they are no match for myself of course they can fight back and hold their line. One of the things I find an issue with many racing games AI is that they are too tentative when attempting to overtake. Not shy in this game however! The Grid series was for me a little pretentious in places. Especially Grid 2 where it seemed almost every car could only driven with an annoying arcade style drifting style. Not so here. Just like real racings its all about braking, taking the apex nicely and getting the power down fast out of the corner minimising wheelspin. You can even adjust the setup so this can be done smoother although that aspect is fairly simple this is surely a good thing to everyone except a car mechanic. The handling on most codemasters racing games is very good. The rally style handling of the Colin Mcrae games really was spot on and they have always seemed to have a good grasp on that aspect of racing since. Where GTA and Forza often seem to suffer from box-like understeer or wild oversteer you can really get a nice feel for most of the vehicles in Grid. Realistic or not they are satisfying to use.You will however get more than a hint of deja vu if you have bought the previous Grid games. This is more of an update of the previous incarnations than a new game. For me though for the price you cannot argue. The game bears the name of a popular motorsport magazine and herein lies the key difference in the Grid series that makes this one stand out. The racing is a sober and realistic (without being too realistic). They have stopped trying to copy Need For Speed and actually produced something reminiscent Codemasters great racing games of old. As a bit of a purist I wasn't sure about the rewind feature, although on reflection I think its actually quite handy. Especially in a long race against the computer cars (where you would have had to restart the race on older games).There is a wide selection of cars and tracks on offer. I think this is where the game progressing from the earlier titles comes in handy, since much of the old content has simply been given a lick of paint whilst new machinery has been added on top of that. The tin tops and open wheelers both handle characteristic to their class. Such great tracks as Spa, Brands Hatch and Hockenheim are all beautifully rendered.  The damage engine much like previous Grid games is very satisfying. The only game that I recall that comes close to its level of intricacy is on of the recent GTA games. You can enjoy some epic and frightiningly realistic looking shunts. Here is also where improved technology in the visual department is beneficial. The sense of speed is more tangible than ever and when you do get it very wrong you thank your lucky stars its a game and you are not inside the roll-cage! I am not a moaner and realise you don't always get what you want in life. But if I had to criticize this game I would probably say I would have liked a few more real permanent circuits (even if that meant less fictional street circuits.)  Also to complete career mode you have to total every class of racing in the game. Certain classes I like and certain ones not so much so they became somewhat of a chore. I also think the endurance class was quite interesting but they missed an opportunity to put in much longer truer enduro racing with pit-stops. Pit stops were one of the reasons TOCA 2 is one of my all-time favorite games. Overall this is a game for race fans by race fans and they have done a tidy job.			",34,6,5,3,4,1,15

												GRID autosport is a fantastic game for those who love auto racing simulation. This is the best game yet in the GRID series, with fantastic multiplayer online, great car tuning, and realistic real world tracks. This is tons of fun with an xbox controller, or even a racing wheel and pedals. If you prefer arcade games, get something like burnout (also fantastic) but if you want simulation, the $9.99 you can get this for on sale is great! -PR0XIDIAN			",912,138,59,85,56,7,110

												Grid Autosport Well what can i say except that the game is absolutely epic, the cars are awesome and race physics is pretty close to the real thing, so overall the game is amazingly realistic. Codemasters actually listened when everyone was asking if they could bring back the V8 Supercars and Brittish TOCA series, they kind of got it right by bringing in the Super Tourers catagory with the VF Holden Commodore and FG Ford Falcon since the game did not have the V8 Supercars Australia series in it i cant say i was too excited, but now that one of our friends at www.racedepartment.com has released a modification for the V8 Supercars 2014 i am absolutely amazed. This game has now gone from great to absolutely awesome now that this has been released.my overall rating is5 Stars *****			",0,0,2,0,0,0,0

												Like many others I was a huge fan of the original GRID. Like many other I thought Grid 2 was a huge misstep. Like many others I think this is even worse. Welcome to the new era of annual releases packed with day 1 DLC. I definitely do not recommend this game. The career is a farce, in my opinion. You don't progress or improve so much as you simply pick a new team in between every race, and drive a borrowed car. There's no sense of ownership in your accomplishments; the online is no better. Don't listen to what Codemasters says about listening to the community. It's all nonsense. The cars handle the same as G2, the career is infinitely more bland, the AI still attempts to kill you at every turn, and the online has no accountable match making system. My advice would be to simply re-play GRID 1. It's still the superior experience. A waste, and a squandered opportunity. This will be my last Codemasters racing game purchase for a long time. They've got a lot of work to do to earn my trust back.			",187,13,13,34,32,2,29

Makes you miss the old days when all the cars were eventually unlockable by beating the game instead of having to purchase ""car packs""  or a season pass. Other than that the handling is pretty realistic.			",118,5,6,8,2,1,3

												Here it is.....bottom line.  This is a good game, it has its flaws, absolutely, in fact, I will list them:- AI is not great- AI is very aggressive in a non-realistic manner (i.e. ramming, bumping, etc.)- Racenet online challenges need to be sorted because many are leaderboards based on timed laps, yet the AI is there preventing time to really be the challenge due to the above issue.- Codemasters loves DLC, so much so that key components that should be present in the game, are pay for (i.e. garage space, additional ""special"" vehicles, and the one I am most irritated by is XP boost.- No Touge for drift, though we are told it is coming as a DLC (and see my point above)Now the good, then some explanation on the reason I reccomend the game.The good:- Fantastic sim-like racing- Each vehicle handles a little different, and you need to learn the vehicle, the track, and improve your skills based on that.- The multiplayer, although lacking spectate (ahem, this is needed yesterday) is really tons of fun with friends.- Racing teams online, thats right you and your besties, can enter as a team, in custom cups or whatever, ultimately competing against other teams and their standings.- Relatively good visual graphics and audioNow, after reading all of that, the game is a brand new release, and here is why I reccomend it, regardless of the negatives.  This is the best there actually is right now in PC racing.  In fact, I would venture to say that for a while this will be the standard, although we will have to see how Assetto Corsa and Project CARS turns out, but as for now, this is the crowning king.  However, the DLC, about that, yeah, I don't like it, but I think that if the company themselves would market this as an MMO with a monthly, then release the features as they have been, then everyones jimmys wouldnt be rustled.  The bottom line, right or wrong, DLC is the new gaming concept over subscription.  Think about it ESO $50 then $15 a month, WoW pretty much the same, SWTOR on its release was the same, you get what I am saying.  In fact many MMO's especially FTP, and games like The Secret World, offer issues on a quarterly basis, that expand the game, this is really no different. Am I defending the DLC tactic, not really, but on the same token the company has to have some motivation to support the game after launch, unlike MXGP, and other lesser games.  The true test will be what this game is like in a couple of months, and then see if the bugs and AI issues have been sorted out, at that time I will eat my review, but as of now I reccomend the game, and hope these issues are sorted.

												More simulation than previous Grid versions, and a move in the right direction. Very good graphics and damage physics as usual with a huge scope of race types and events. A lot more content expected on DLC, but more than enough to keep you entertained from the standard purchase too.One of the best driving games for PC at the moment. A good balance between realism and playability. Well done codemasters. The replay system is very cool and the AI are very realistic.

												Grid Autosport Well what can i say except that the game is absolutely epic, the cars are awesome and race physics is pretty close to the real thing, so overall the game is amazingly realistic. Codemasters actually listened when everyone was asking if they could bring back the V8 Supercars and Brittish TOCA series, they kind of got it right by bringing in the Super Tourers catagory with the VF Holden Commodore and FG Ford Falcon since the game did not have the V8 Supercars Australia series in it i cant say i was too excited, but now that one of our friends at www.racedepartment.com has released a modification for the V8 Supercars 2014 i am absolutely amazed. This game has now gone from great to absolutely awesome now that this has been released.my overall rating is5 Stars *****			",0,0,2,0,0,0,0

												Like many others I was a huge fan of the original GRID. Like many other I thought Grid 2 was a huge misstep. Like many others I think this is even worse. Welcome to the new era of annual releases packed with day 1 DLC. I definitely do not recommend this game. The career is a farce, in my opinion. You don't progress or improve so much as you simply pick a new team in between every race, and drive a borrowed car. There's no sense of ownership in your accomplishments; the online is no better. Don't listen to what Codemasters says about listening to the community. It's all nonsense. The cars handle the same as G2, the career is infinitely more bland, the AI still attempts to kill you at every turn, and the online has no accountable match making system. My advice would be to simply re-play GRID 1. It's still the superior experience. A waste, and a squandered opportunity. This will be my last Codemasters racing game purchase for a long time. They've got a lot of work to do to earn my trust back.			",187,13,13,34,32,2,29

												8/10 Brings back the feeling of the old arcade eruo racing but with enhanced graphics. Be, is kind of a dlc hog. Makes you miss the old days when all the cars were eventually unlockable by beating the game instead of having to purchase ""car packs""  or a season pass. Other than that the handling is pretty realistic.			",118,5,6,8,2,1,3

												[h2]The Good:[/h2]* Beautiful graphics, even without the texture pack, pumping all the sliders to maximum produces some very pleasing pixels.* Strikes a good simulation / arcade balance, most of the time your car behaves the way you would expect it to, very occasionally they seem to have far to much grip, and then some other times none at all. * Great selection of different cars that sound very similar to the real deal.* Challenging AI will punish you for almost every mistake, and will make you fight for every position.* Clean and Intuitive User Interface, not as ""pretty"" but far more usable than the dirt games.* Varied game modes that I, personally, will take a while to master, Touring and Street racing are my favourites, and the Endurance, Drifting and Open Wheel events are quite challenging (maybe not open wheel for F1 vets?)[h2]The Bad:[/h2]* AI that disobeys the rules the player must stick to, quite a few times I've been tailgating an AI opponent and been penalised for going off track, with the AI racing off ahead of me. * The game lacks personality, the DiRT 2 and 3 games were brimming with character and style, that could be a little cheesy, but enjoyable.

												Grid Autosport is as fun as the old Toca series in multiplayer physic wise. They even took the giant track in reverse like the spa which force you to learn a lot when it come for track layout. The car physic isn't too hard. the most fun part is that some different cars physics feel a lot different on each class. It may seem easy, but it's between sim & pro sim in Toca 2. If lose traction, you may not be able to recover if the angle is too high. Implementation of rumble strip act more like rumble strip & the grass tip your car to fall on the top is awesome(exclusive).The tracks are simply gorgeous. I'll probably say it is the best looking track I've seen on PC so far, normally you see the graphic all concentrated into the cars & the rest look like crap. The cars look great & detailled too, but not in the photo realism level. The wheels still look in 3d unlike forza motion blur that make the wheels look in 2d. The cockpit cam is simplified & I'm one of the believer that it's a waste of time to put too much effort there. Replay camera have been fixed & look more professional. I can now enjoy watching the replay, especially the drift event. With the RX7 grey, it look nearly real. One thing that bug me a bit is the physic being like Toca make the car all float around the track in the replay, except for the drift which look realistic. I believe some fake steering input animation implementation would fix the appearance during the replay. Automatic wings & the tailpipe boom boom spitfire is well animated with sound.The content, I didn't have the time to explore the whole game, but I can definitely write it has enough contents to make your gameplay past 40hours for sure. It has qualification, practice & someone who help you to know what's happening in the race by a press of a button. You can command your teammate to drive aggressively or not during the race(It can be helpful to win position or block the AI path). It has many series with different car handling with load of tracks & many are real world ones. If you play online, expect to play a lot of hours. The car won't throw off like ping pong if get touched & it's very good for a close race. ",110,7,18,20,4,0,3

												I purchased and beat Grid 1 and had a pretty good time with it. Then Grid 2 was announced but they said they weren't including cockpit view. That's lazy as hell and I skipped Grid 2. Then Grid Autosport was announced and cockpit view was making a return. YAY! Just recently all of Codemaster's games recieved major discounts. I picked up Grid Autosport and gave it a try. I'm over 10 hours in and while the game is fun overall, there are a few things I don't like. The main thing is that yes, the cockpit view is back, but only sort of. The view is there, but the gauges are a static image, any car that has shift lights don't actually have working shift lights, and then the entire dash is blurred. The rearview mirrors don't even work and they, too, are blurred. There is also the lack of a field of view option.There is also rubberbanding. It's the strongest in the touring car discipline. You can disable it by deleting a file but that file is tied to the game's anti-piracy system for some reason. This means that if you delete the file to get rid of rubberbanding, the game won't let you save your progress. That's ridiculous and pathetic. The AI is also extremely aggressive and will slam into you when you try to pass them. Codemasters wants this game to have some sim-like elements but won't include a full cockpit view and adds rubberbanding. It's like they want to make a racing game but also don't want to make a racing game.There aren't a whole lot of tracks present but the ones included do look alright. The cars look nice as well. There's some DLC available (of course) but I'm not spending any more money on this game so I'm not sure how that content is.There are some positives, though. The graphics are okay and there's no FPS lock. The game runs pretty smoothly. There's a few different disciplines and a decent variety of vehicles. Lots of input devices are supported and there's a nice amount of graphical options and difficulty options. The sounds are pretty good, from engine noises to crowds and track sounds, everything sounds nice. So while the game can be fun, I can't recommend it due to the half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥cockpit view and inclusion of rubberbanding AI. And I definitely wouldn't recommend it at its normal $50 price. Wait a while and pick it up when it gets to $10 if you really want to try it.			",184,31,27,21,31,4,12

												This is a very nice racing game for thoose who just want to race on their own. It's not a very good game for thoose who want to play multiplayer. (If you want to play multiplayer I recomend you Grid 2).There are many interesting modes in the offline-mode (e.g. formular A; endurance;...).So if you don't want to play just one kind of racing like the F-1-Simulator is this a very good game for you.

												Good racing game.  Takes almost everything I like from Grid and Grid 2 and put them together.  You have 5 different disciplines to race in.  Each has its unique cars and challenges.  Once you reach certain levels in all 5 disciplines, you unlock the Grid racing for that level.  The variety of cars and tracks keeps you on your toes.  The online is good too as long as you don't end up in a room full of rammers.  If you don't particularly want to race against opponents, then there is the weekly challenges that you can race.  You compete for level awards and can compare yourself to others.  If you like the Codemaster racing games, this is a no brainer.			",222,9,20,20,18,4,14

												This is a game for true motorsport lovers. Here you can go straight to the point - drive the best available race cars out there in professional championships and make a name for yourself changing between the categories of your choice anytime you want (rather than being forced to drive housewife lemons in endless itty-bitty cups to climb in your career, such as the likings of Gran Tourismo and Forza). The career mode offers a great experience where you'll have to beat rivals, help teammates and please all your sponsors in order to make progress throughout the seasons. Gameplay can be completely adjusted to your skills and likings, so if you prefer some more pedal-to-the-metal arcade race with no damage or a full simulation with deep physics it's all up to you to set. Graphics are simply stunning, and the sceneries are richly detailed, which comes in handy considering you'll be visiting many metropolises around the globe.Bottomline, best racing sim ever.

 Disappointing Let me start off by saying I was a huge fan of the original GRID. It wasn't realistic, but it was fun.So how does GRID Autosport stack up? It has its similarities to GRID but it isn't as good.PROSThe game is fun and there is a large variety of different vehicle types to choose from. The handling is a bit slippery but it's really easy to handle even with all assists off. This allows you to go around corners at really high speeds which adds to the excitement at the expense of realism.CONSThe game is NOT complete. The interiors are nothing but blurry pictures. Even at night, you can't see any lights inside the vehicle. What's the point of a cockpit view if you can't even see your own speedometer? The game also lacks content. Sure there are a wide range of different types of vehicles (Indy, Coupes, Touring, etc) but considering how the interiors are non-existent couldn't they have stuffed a little more in there instead of releasing an early DLC? The track selection is adequet. There are lots of famous tracks and a lot of city tracks but the number of different tracks is still relatively low. Finally, the game itself can get quite boring. The campaign is like any other campaign. You win races and you climb up into better and faster cars. The problem is, for the first several hours, you're basically driving the same car on the same tracks. This gets tedious especially since some events require you to complete the same track twice.CONCLUSIONWith games like Gran Turismo 6, Forza 5, F1 2013, and Shift 2 out, it's hard to recommend this game content-wise. The gameplay however is not lacking although it may feel dull at times. The conclusion? This game feels rushed and Codemasters should have spent more time on it.			",18,1,17,3,5,1,5

												I'm not playing much racing games but I must say I realy enjoy this one. I'm playing on normal difficulty with manual gear shifting and I the difficilty is just right. It's really hard to win races but I can keep up with my sponsors demands. The game looks great but for a racing game I expected that.A small issue with it is that I'm not seeing the difference in AI between open wheel and the compact touring or street racing. I would expect a really aggrasive AI in the touring and street races but they are kinda passive. For the open wheel races I sometimes get bumped by someone for a legitemate takeover and thus losing the sponsors zero collision demand. It's really hard to get that.A much larger issue is the sound, I have put all sound on low but there is still a lot of crackling especially in the cut scenes. I just have a onboard soundcard but I'm only experiencing this with this game. It baffles me they could not do the sound right, it's kinda important for a racing game imho.I would give this a 8/10 but without the sound issues I would rank this 9/10 since I'm having a ton of fun with it.

One of the few racing games out there that do, and thanks for that! Enjoying it a lot so far! ;)			",109,21,2,10,17,2,12

												The GRID series of games from Codemasters is probably one of favourite franchises out there and I've been following them for quite a while, since TOCA 3 infact.Where as GRID 2 appealed more to the arcade driver with less emphasis on realism. GRID Autosport is going back to its roots and feels much more like a simulator as seen in the TOCA series of games and GRID 1 ( if you guys have been following the series for that long, you will know what I mean ). The driving in this game definately appeals more to hardcore ""Sim"" racer ( by bringing back cockpit view among other things ) and this game definately rewards you for that by giving you XP bonuses for driving a clean race without collisions.Right off the bat, the game looks graphically similar to GRID 2 but there are noticeable improvements in car textures ( Free DLC to update car livery textures to 4k res ), lighting and shadows. Multiplayer is quite fun with you having to work your way up from the bottom. Each car you own in Multiplayer has its own milage, so the higher the milage the more the car will cost to maintain. 12 players lined up on the ( AI can be used to fill in the blanks ) all racing to the finish line. This is a blast when playing with friends.To sum up, this game is made by petrolheads for petrolheads and that's why I enjoy it.			",93,2,22,11,6,1,6

												While GRID 2 was some good fun to me for quite a couple of hours, GRID Autosport just bores the Sh*t outta me. It tries to be 'realistic', but it isn't. It's way too far away from realistic than you'd think. Beyond that, the offline-career mode is way too big - not that I don't like long campaigns but this 'career' feels like a torment for your brain. You suffer through struggles with 'teammates' (not worth anything), boring tasks from sponsors, always the same circuits. Sorry, but I had more fun playing Trackmania...To be honest I cannot judge the online-mode, I did not like it in GRID 2, that's why I kept my hands off it in GA. So far I'm highly disappointed of (the offline) GRID Autosport.			",340,78,18,55,52,7,63

												Almost as large of a disappointment as Dirt 3. I was lucky to get the game off♥♥♥♥♥for 10 bucks but that does not fix glaring problems I encountered in the first 3 hours of playing this game. First off loading into the game, I setup my G27 and enter career mode. My steering wheel has zero force feedback going to it. Why would this be turned off in a racing game? Even after 30 minutes of tinkering I got a setup that was atleast driveable but sill felt disconnected After racing for a bit I only got further disappointed, handling is bleh, braking far too sharp and the worse part of this game, the AI. The AI is literally pants on head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or overly aggressive, with any contact resulting in bouncing off of them or you spinning out. Interior view has everything from the dashboard back looking like a camera lense with vaseline on it. No idea if the high res texture pack fixes it but I refuse to download a 3GB ""patch"" for something that should have never been left like that in a title such as GRID.The good, I really do like the option of having a second monitor display race information in a broadcasting layout. Would have loved it even more to pick what items to have up on the second monitor but I am not complaining there. I also like the benchmarking ability to better optimize your ingame graphical settings. Past that it is just another mediocre racing game that does nothing new nor does anything well.

												This Review is more of a First Impressions to be honest. The Only reason I got this game was because they announced VR support and fully support the Oculus Rift DK2.A massive tip for those that want to run the game in vr is to get OBS.OBS acts as a way to be able to view the game mirrored to a monitor via the preview option. This enables you to have full visibility of the menu as the menu's do not currently render in VR (This is understandable as they were never meant for it)Initially I was underwhelmed with the game after I managed to get it running,The VR is actually done very well with full positional tracking enabled realistic 3d environments with a cockpit view. The cockpit feels like an after thought though. It is too basic and other games do a far better job with interiors. The mirrors are not usable because they are very dark to the point where you can not see anything other than the sky reflecting for some reason? The recent patch does add a rear view mirror though which is great but I would love to be able to use the side mirrors to block overtakes and judge where the competion is.I play full manual with the Logitech G27 which is fully supported. BUT THERE IS NO OPTION FOR FORCE FEEDBACK only vibration... BUT... you can download Force feedback files from GRID 2!! UNOFFICALLY then overwrite and BOOM full force feedback enabled and this is a game changer!!This brings the game to life and actually lets you feel the car like you should. These files should have been implemented WITH the game though and this is a serious issue that many will not be able to overcome. This will probably mean that I cant go online in GRID because of modified game files.....The single player game is such a challenge though that even on the lowest setting you will be in for a fight! The racing feels exciting and reminds me of aggressive touring the game is very exciting when you are trading paint in the pack hustling and fighting for positions.There is massive room for improvements to be made. I would still 100% recommend this game to anyone with an Oculus Rift and will be putting a lot of time in and do not regret the purchase.Hope this helps			",378,83,29,22,29,3,14

												I don't like to write reviews for a game if I have less than 4 hours of gameplay, but I'll do it anyway. (106 minutes when writing this).If you're looking for a racing sim: this is the wrong game for you. If you're looking for a fun arcade racing game: you could try this game, but Need for Speed or Grid 2 would be recommended if you're an arcade racer. This game is in the middle of being a racing sim and being an arcade game.You have to be able to control a fast racing car on track to play this game, but you don't need to driver super realistic. Sliding a bit trough corners are OK, but you have to fight cars in this game more than in Grid 2. I, my self, am a fan of the racing sim games, those were you have to hit braking points and apexes about perfect to have a chance, where sliding trough corners isn't the fastest way to finish. For me this game is fun to play, but not a game that satifies my racing sim needs. This game is just for fun in my opinion, not a game where you try your hardest.AI may not be perfect, they love to drive into you hard or gentle, enough to make you annoyed at some times. ALWAYS be careful when overtaking or defending. The game still is fun though, but again: just for fun, not a game for the hardcore sim racers.The game runs very nicely on my computer, with high graphic setting. Average FPS on a decent gaming PC with high graphics can be between 45 and 50 FPS, so its fine.I would recommend this game, but remember: not a sim racing game for those of you who want that. Don't expect that. Handling is much better than arcade games though, so its not too unrealistic.			",63,16,28,3,46,0,7

												GRID Autosport is the third game released under the GRID franchise from Codemasters. If you were a fan of the original GRID release but not GRID 2, you'll be pleasantly suprised by Codemasters sudden switch back to the more 'Simulation' side of the franchise over the arcade style of GRID 2. It is no way a competitor to serious sims like rFactor or Assetto Corsa. But it is a much more serious take on driving over what was done in GRID 2. The first person drivers view is back, after so many PC gamers questioned Codemasters decision to remove it in GRID 2. This time around they have not as many racing disciplines as the original GRID, instead focusing on 5 specific which are: Touring, Open Wheel, Endurance, Tuner and Street.While I definitely will miss events like Touge and Destruction derby. I am very pleased by the move back towards the experiance I had in GRID. I loved driving in the game from the drivers view with Track IR, it add's so much to the game that I'd recommend it just on that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an overhaul of my original review, where I did not recommend it at that point. I wrote it out of pure disappointment and frustration, that I could not get the game working in full screen. Well, the game itself was working but my keyboard and controller didn't respond. In the end the solution was a silly mouseclick after the game had started! At the moment there are more people reporting full screen issues, that are bypassable. However, CM should really fix this.I played the game for a good five hours now and I can give my first impressions of it. First of all, the thums down has changed to a thumbs up. I'm really enjoying the game so far. Car handling is just what I expected; semi-realistic but not too hardcore. I'm not a professional so I can't judge how realistic they actually are or aren't. There are some 12 year olds out there that can go really in depth on how spot on the physics are or why they just suck :)  For me it's just a really nice simcade. Totally different then Grid 2, wich was a total driftfest, wich got a bit boring in the end. Graphics and sound are really good too. It's not a big improvement over Grid 2 but that game already looked fantastic imo. Graphics options are highly adjustable. The game can run smooth on both high end and not so high end hardware. The whole game focuses on a more realistic approach on motorsport, with more believable contracts, the ability to practice and qualify before the race (thanks you CM!) wich is optional by the way. There's also the option to multiply the race duration in the career mode, wich is really welcome and adds again more realism. Some races are over too soon, with just the standard 3 or 4 laps. The AI is also quite good. On higher difficulty levels they are really competitive. I'm someone who enjoys racing against good AI more then against random people, since AI cars don't try to ram you off the track as soon as the race starts but actually race you. That's why I didn't touch the MP yet. I'm only interested in clean racing against serious players. If you're looking for that too, feel free to add me :)  So these first impressions were all about single player. I did however some online Racenet challenges that are renewed weekly, just like in Grid 2. So all in all a really good game and a massive improvement over Grid 2. If you loved the first Grid but didn't like the second one due to it's arcady physics you should really enjoy this one.			",326,58,45,16,44,6,25

												Bloody good game. I was skeptical at first, but the more I play it, the more well designed I think it is.I read an article that Codemasters designed the game to be a mix between sim and arcade, trying to hit a sweet spot. I think they did a bang up job. The racing is solid. Cars take damage and you can check the condition. When car parts like bumpers and side view mirrors come off, they hit the road and bounce just like they would in real life. The single player is a lot of fun.Now here's some important info. You do level up in the game, and how many points you get is determined by what options you have on that make driving easier. The game takes away bonus point percentage if you are driving automatic instead of stick, if you have the camera view outside of the car instead of in the interior, the difficulty of the bots, if you're using a trail marker, stuff like that. I think that's smart and will cater very well to the hardcore crowd. The AI in this game, is the only thing on my list of complaints. They will slow down to not slam into you, but they will run you off the road and slam you from the side. It's like playing with 12 year old trolls. You can race many types of cars in this game, and they are categorized by 5 disciplines. F1 cars are also included. The amount of cars in this game will have you hooked. Very key in a racing game.How's the online? For one, I don't notice any lag, really. I think the game might have a server system because I've been racing with mostly Americans/Canadians. I am located in Miami, FL, FYI. Also, you can play with your euro buddies as well. I just haven't ended up in matchmaking with any, but I'm sure others probably have. Let me make this clear: YOU CAN ONLY UNLOCK CARS ONLINE. The single player is fun but its just for achievements. You unlock everything in multiplayer. You can play with other people or do the RaceNet challenges to make money and XP. Very important. You can also start car clubs and earn XP for it. You have to go to racenet.codemasters.com to do it. As far as registering an account, you can do that in-game and there's no e-mail verification.To conclude, I will tell you something you don't hear often in this day and age. This game has little to no bugs. I haven't experienced any. It is very fluid and well-designed. After playing this game, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. I've been recommending it to friends. I say get it. It's not a complete sim and it's not a complete arcade.			",210,3,16,14,3,1,29

												Recommended, recommended, recommended!I'll opt for an 85% rating for Grid Autosport primarily because;* Pack racing is back with softened handling models!  Think more PS1 ToCA and a bit less Grid2.* Awesome selection of circuits/tracks and vehicles.* Multiple racing disciplines catered for (like Grid2) with Touring, Endurance, Street, Drift/Tuner, Open-wheelers.* Wear and damage mechanics fits the gameplay very well.* Vastly improved UI for tuning tweaks between races.* The garage system and XP levelling works very well, with a fairer upgrade system.  Aids longevity.* Streamlined menus and navigation (compared to Grid2 especially.)* Solo career mode is actually engaging this time.  A definate nostalgia nod to the Alain Menu rivalry of PS1 ToCA days.* The visuals and audio are highly optimised throughout for low-ultra PC system specs.* Above all - it's a fun, varied racer with that ""i'll just have one more go"" factor!Deductions and downsides are;* No text chat (or even spectator mode) that makes waiting around in lobbies for the next race rather dull, and democratic custom cups changes almost impossible.* Region-locked lobby creation is promoting tumbleweed already sadly... - i've only met 4 Americans and 1 Canadian all week [tsk, I fully realise some friends see this as a positive! rotflmao :)) ]* No gamepad/joystick calibration options contrary to supported wheels.* Disfunctional team radio feature (and absent from MP.)* No mirrors (or acceptable interiors for PC due to PS3/Xbox limitations) and fixed 90' headlook views.Upshot;* Touring with twelve car Mr Bean-esque pack racing in Minis around Brands Hatch is an arcade game exclusive and hilarious!  Truely it's a sight to behold, so come and join in folks.* Why sit there reading this Grid Autosport review when you could be on track having fun?			",75,13,9,11,7,2,11

												GRID Autosport and Assetto Corsa brings us PC gamers closer to that Forza Motorsport and Gran Turismo level of racing. This is my review of GRID Autosport in the time that I've played it and I hope you enjoy reading it.Gameplay:GRID Autosport provides a fun environment plus intense racing to give you the perfect balance between Simulation and Arcade.The driving model is very good as it's not too challenging but at the same time you can't underestimate it or else you'll be put into a wall.There are 5 disciplines in this game: Tuner, Street, Open Wheel, Endurance, and Touring.These 5 different disciplines all bring a unique selection of cars and unique gameplay.This all works very well in making a fun yet challenging game that can give Forza Motorsport and Gran Turismo fans such as myself the same level of entertainment except on the PC platform.Codemasters have made a huge improvement to their racing franchises (since the fall of quality aka. DiRT Showdown) by listening to the community and what they want in a racing game.GRID 2 had a extremely arcade like driving model and lacked many features including interior camera, since then they've taken all the feedback and produced this great game.AI is extremely well done, they know what they're doing (most of the time) and have proven to be a formiddable opponent at higher AI difficulties.Also there are many many camera angles to suit anybody's preference. Story:This game features quite a flexible campaign to become the best at all 5 disciplines and become the GRID Champion.It's pretty much the same as Forza in which you choose a series to do and then you do it.GRID makes this concept more enjoyable by making you pick what team you'd like to race for the series and that team has objectives to complete during that season and certain vehicles picked out for you. You also get a teammate in that series (Beware, They're pretty damn bad) which you control their aggression through 5 stages.Defend Position, Hold Position, Balanced, Push Position, Attack PositionThis makes for very dynamic gameplay as you also have to focus on another AI's aggresion of the race and estimate their stress levels.Each team has a livery for particular vehicles such as: Kicker's Volkswagon Golf Livery. The real joy is in the Multiplayer portion of the game.Multiplayer:In Multiplayer you have to earn money by doing challenges and racing other players in intense races.Normally that's all a Multiplayer is? Yeah but not in this game.The real joy of Multiplayer is managing a garage of vehicles you've purchased and then making custom liveries for them giving a sense of personalisation and pride.The higher the rank the more range of sponsors you can put onto your vehicle.You can also make a Club of friends or strangers that has a custom made livery for all members to use.Cons:This game would be great if only these four things weren't on this portion of the review.         - Interior is poorly textured and blurred. Originally made so people would focus on the track instead of the interior making                         a saddening atmosphere in the vehicle.         - No looking around the vehicle's interior. Another let down but at least 4K users get a great version of the game where               they can see all of the cockpit.         - Blurred out mirrors. The side and rear view mirrors are blurred out and don't actually work at all which is another             saddening aspect of the interior viewing.         - Not many people playing multiplayer.I hope you enjoyed reading this review and I hope this helped make you decide if you'd like to buy it or not.I give this a 9 out of 10			",98,4,8,7,8,0,16

												It just dosen't feel the same anymore... the first game was by far my favourite of the series because you have your own team and money to buy the cars you want not driving for other teams and earning ''fans'' in grid 2 and ''XP'' in Grid Autosport witch on the whole i found less emursing, But on the other hand the graphics are stunning and the handling is crisp and realsitic but i just hope in grid 4 they will go more back to the old game and add some of the best features in so it becomes more enjoyable for the hardcore grid fans and more understandable for people new to the series too.

												If you enjoy fast paced racing Games on a team, You well enjoy this game. Grid Autosport has come a long way from grid 1 and 2. It's still that eye candy master piece of stunning HD graphics it has alwas been but has grown into a sophisticated racing sim with real world vehicle handling/physics compard too Grid Two's sloppying push it to the edge racng (Drifting and Power Slidding through every corner). Offline contains 5 different disciplines with multiple tournaments allowing you to level up each type. Online is ok, you can use all the cars and are givin the option to level them up with upgrades as you progress through each disciplines and car level. The only issue i have is each race group is broken down into groups that contain 1 to 4 cars and your only allowed 6 cars to custom, leaving you to a very limited amount of veriety for racing compared to other racering games. 8/10			",129,26,13,11,23,2,7

												In my Grid 2 review, I complained about the lack of cockpit view. Said it was very 'arcadey'. But as you can see form my profile, I ended up playing it quite alot and enjoyed it for what it was... Anyway, I had high hopes for Autosport when I heard Grid 2's failings had been addressed based on feedback from the community. Cockpit view in this version and more realistic handling. A cross between sim and arcade. However, even though I havent played this much yet, I was instantly disappointed. Cockpit view is a joke, it's really blurry and you can't see the car interior or the gauges. The first Grid is better! I'll probably end up playing Autosport with bonnet view like I did for Grid 2. Need to start watching YouTube videos before buying games. Be warned.			",89,12,7,4,4,1,3

												I love playing this game. It has a lot of cars to choose from and really nice graphics. There are a lot of races in the career mode. There is good amount of tuning and upgrades for your cars. Online playing is fun because you can race up to 11 friends and their are racenet challenges (which are good ways to earn money during multiplier/online).If you want anyone to play with join GASR group.

												I love Autosport, it really does feel and play like the old TOCAs and Grid 1. Combined with tracks that are very fun to race on, like Mount Tremblant, Autosport Raceway and Okutama (which I love trying to take flat out), Autosport is just fun.I have only raced the AI in Street and Open Wheel so far, haven't gone online yet.I love racing the AI, they are tough to pass at the higher difficulties and are quick. They tend to be brick-like and absolutely stable on the track when you collide with them (which you will because they tend to be a bit blind and don't acknoledge your car at times). You will spin and they will not. It's a great thing that you can't just shove them out of the way, however it does feel one-sided because of how easy your car gets shoved out of the way.The career mode is nice but does not hold a candle to the career mode in GRID. In Autosport you only sign contracts to drive with other teams, with minimal ability to change the car's handling/sponsors/liveries. You don't have that team building you had in GRID, so you can't hire a teammate, upgrade your car, change sponsors for more XP, etc. In the different disciplines you do tend to race on the same tracks over and over, just with different configurations, which also makes career feel a bit thin. I read that sometimes you get stuck with different events in career that do not align with the path you chosen, meaning that if you choose to do street you get stuck with a drift event. I'm not sure if I will like that, however I haven't come across it yet.While racing, depending on your settings, you gain XP which is used to unlock higher disciplines. Going without assists, locking your view to cockpit (why would you do that, the cockpits are terrible), and higher difficulties = higher XP gained and faster career progression. You can eventually unlock a GRID league, which is all 5 disciplines combined.Graphically, the game seems really optimised, I have 50+ fps on a rig with a GTX 580 on ultra settings. It is pretty nice looking, with nice details on the cars (not project cars good). CM did a great job making the racing environment seem alive, with announcers announcing incidents, the crowd cheering, helicopters and other outside events making the tracks seem 'alive'. The cockpits are terrible however, they were just put there to appease those who complained about them missing in GRID 2. They are blurry, the mirrors are useless, and it is a bit distracting for me to drive using that view.Need to try out online before I give my final verdict, but I do really love the game because of the racing. The racing is pure fun, the packaging can use a little more work.Pros:The racing AI is tough at the higher difficultiesCan choose what path in career to take (in a way)Lots of tracks and cars to useCons:Career mode is a bit thinThe AI are tanks and blindCockpits are terrible			",450,126,43,109,14,4,30

												I've only just bought this game. I didn't like the original Grid so I skipped Grid 2 but a friend of mine toldme to check out autosport. Turn off all your assists and set the difficulty to your skill level and the racing is absolutely intense. The AI are smart and won't just smash into you like in other games (Forza). The crash physics (as always in codemasters games) are fantastic. The handling may feel a bit arcade-like but it is much more realistic than most other racing games on the PC barring actual simulators. The car selection feels a nit short because I'm used to Gran Turismo and Forza but it is an interesting mix and the class system is done pretty decently. I have not yet tried online play but from a single-player standpoint, I'm have a great ride.			",120,3,6,8,6,1,3

												Another Grid game, I have played all the Grid and Dirt games. Pro's: Nice graphics if your pc can handle them. Good controls for pc controllers and the xbox 360 pc controller does very well. The Logitech G27 works well but you might need to do some tweaking. For hardcore racers you will know a lot of the tracks from other racing games. Sound is awesome again in my opinion. There are day races and even some night time races as well. A ton of cars to choose from! Multiplayer runs nice and smooth and i have come across a lot of clean drivers.Cons: Single player cars DO NOT carry over to multiplayer.. Some people have mic issues with massive echoing etc. People can be easily voted out of rooms if they are bad drivers. Sometimes people that win all the time are also booted which i don't agree with. Starting out in multiplayer can be pretty confusing and you have limited garage room.The game is overall good and would recommend this game for fans of the series and racing!			",19,1,2,3,4,1,4

												I reluctantly bought this game after hours of nagging by my mate. Let's set the foundation here GRID 1 was awesome, GRID 2 was a shower of♥♥♥♥♥♥and put me off the franchise altogether.I am so glad I got this game, it really is fun to play and the multiplayer rocks! For me they have fixed the things that made the second GRID bad and reinstated the pros from the first GRID. So say goodbye to  the fails of GRID 2. This game also adds a new dynamic, you pay for the damage to the car and it totally works, especially if you want to buy your own car for multiplayer (which you need to do to be able to upgrade it later on). It pays to race fairly.Cockpit view is back yay and although people are complaining about it lacking detail in that view.  I prefer it this way, it lets me focus on the track.Get this game it's class, don't believe me? Jump in an Ariel Atom and experience the fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												PROS: - Cars look awesome from the outside, Tracks and locales are breathtaking when graphics are turned up. - Challenging in a way that makes you want to get better. Not easy, but gratifying when you master turns.- I personally, in real life, drive a recent model Ford Focus, and the control of the Focus ST in the game is as i would expect when driving the ST version of my car. If i made it a point to negotiate turns as i would in real life, it worked out better. CONS: - HOWEVER (on the last point) the ST is known for it's ludicrous cornering ability, and i had to upgrade the car and Soften the front suspenstion/stiffen the rear suspension to get the most realistic driving experience one should expect from the ST. I could be biased but the car is an autocross machine and handles perfectly well just as stock. - car interiors ARE A JOKE. I only play racing games in first person in-car view so as to fully immerse myself in the experience. i hate to compare this to Need for Speed, but if you look at Shift, the interiors, even for the low-end/old drifter cars, are immaculately rendered, and you can look around. in Grid, looking left or right blinks the screen left or right to an un-interior generic side view, giving me no frame of reference because my driver didn't turn his head. In addition, on graphical settings where the cockpit isn't blurred, the instrumentation is blocky and disgusting. at night, no dashboard or other interior lights are visible. Again, i drive a focus, and although the shape of the top of the dashboard is correct (even reflecting *almost* as i would expect when the sun hits it, i'm sorry but at night that console needs to be LIT. So yeah, Codemasters, MASSIVE missed opportunity with the car interior. i can't bring myself to look left or right because what i get is a generic blank view of what's on the left or right because my driver doesn't turn his head like NFS Shift so i have no frame of reference, and the worst part is it's just as well because what IS rendered of the interior of the car is a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥POS anyway in both texture and polygon terms. Bad bad bad car interior. That's it, every other part of the game is straight up FUN, with beautifully rendered and presented cars on beautiful tracks and HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥I'M DRIVING IN PARIS THIS IS SO COOL and the driving is awesomely gratifying in just the right realistic correct way that one can get better at before they know it. Car interiors are disgustingly, DISGUSTINGLY disappointing though. Need for Speed: Shift, i'm looking at the exact interior of a Lamborghini Reventon from radio to seat stitching to AC vents. Grid, i'm looking at something a 6 year old made using Duplo bricks. [ ]PS: the yellow paint is on the stock ST is just the right hue, and it is indeed shiny but not as much as is presented in the game where it looks as glossy as a trombone. The real Tangerine Yellow ST is almost almost flat with a slight metallic shine to it. But don't worry, NFS: Most Wanted got it wrong too. Thanks for the great game!!!! :) ",45,0,5,1,0,0,2

												How is GRID Autosport? In my opinion, this is the true successor to the orignal GRID from 2008.Where GRID 2 turned out to be a mere fun racer, this release is back on the right track.It improves the original GRID in every aspect. And what it does is not only good, but sets the standard in PC Racing Games.Finally, I am able to trash Shift, Shift 2 Unleashed, Race07, GTR Evolution. etc.All those RaceSims which promised everything, but GRID Autosport has it all.Painstakingly I have tried all patches , whatever, to make those Racing Games worth my time, where GRID Autosport delivers out-of-the-box.Better handling, better graphics, better driving physics, better cockpit perspective, and especially it offers more fun.Codemasters really proves to be quite good at what they are doing.9 out of 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DR - This is a mostly neutral-to-positive review. While i find it hard to reccomend at full price, i'd still do so.Okay, first things first, what have you guys done to the name of this game? While it's safe to say the GRID series isn't nearly as closely related to the toca race driver series as it used to be, simply naming the 3rd iteration GRID Autosport sounds off to me. Having to explain to people which GRID title i'm referring to is time i could've spent talking about your title instead.I have no idea what to say about the carreer mode at this point, so far, i'm under the impression Team Ravenwest is the hot stuff in town, and i'm not having any of it. I'm far too busy fighting it out with the track and the people right in front or behind me. Atleast they've let me play around with whatever discipline i felt like doing without forcing me to do something else for a change of pace just yet.The handling and physics are pretty similar to GRID2, and while i miss RD:GRID's wacky instant handbrake drifts, i can sorta understand why they went with a slightly less agile approach. However, with every iteration of GRID, the CPU controlled cars seem more agressive and heavy. While i understand driving people off the track to gain the lead has always been a bit of a problem in racing games, CPU Opponents shoulden't be able to effortlessly get me into a wreck just because they don't agree with my driving line.From a technical standpoint, there's a few graphical glitches when using AMD's CrossfireX, sometimes the grass flickers, but seeing how other games just completely fall flat in this regard i can look past it, since the performance scaling is all right. It doesn't change a whole lot, since even at 1440p, maxing out the settings leaves more than enough headroom to comfortable run this maxed out ( safe from some intel only settings, thanks). While the shaders and effects stepped up quite a bit from GRID2, the environments and roads seem left behind on most tracks, leaving you with an uninspired and uninteresting landscape at times. I have yet to see some of the tracks for other disciplines ( i have mostly seen the circuit-esque tracks at the point of writing), so take this with a grain of salt.			",329,49,17,48,53,2,56

This game feels soulless, the DLCs are pretty much unusable (every DLC is a separate driving category meaning you one car (!) is a separate car class so you basically have a race only with Nissan Skylines). This game brings almost nothing new to the table and it's a step back in few points compared to GRID1 or even GRID2.			",229,39,6,37,19,1,29

												Maybe my problem is that I was expecting more of a racing sim and not a flashy arcade style game. It has racing sim elements with the difficulty settings, similar to Forza. The vehicle customization is terrible and annoying since it's based on sponser difficulty level. They spent too much time making the game look nice instead of having actual content and a race system that actually works. You are berrated when you finish a season in 1st place but told you did an excelent job when you don't. They made this game with funding from being coporate shills to get all the sponsers and go figure..they are mostly computer and tech based companies. Drifting is completely unrealisticendurance races are time/distance basedeverything else is just mundane and basicno/little vehicle customizationwhy is there even an upgrades UI? why did they even bother if you can't buy more parts for your caryou can't choose what to drive, its all based on the sponsor you chooseIf you are looking for a racing sim look elsewhere			",238,56,7,39,38,1,41

Atleast they've let me play around with whatever discipline i felt like doing without forcing me to do something else for a change of pace just yet.The handling and physics are pretty similar to GRID2, and while i miss RD:GRID's wacky instant handbrake drifts, i can sorta understand why they went with a slightly less agile approach. However, with every iteration of GRID, the CPU controlled cars seem more agressive and heavy. While i understand driving people off the track to gain the lead has always been a bit of a problem in racing games, CPU Opponents shoulden't be able to effortlessly get me into a wreck just because they don't agree with my driving line.From a technical standpoint, there's a few graphical glitches when using AMD's CrossfireX, sometimes the grass flickers, but seeing how other games just completely fall flat in this regard i can look past it, since the performance scaling is all right. It doesn't change a whole lot, since even at 1440p, maxing out the settings leaves more than enough headroom to comfortable run this maxed out ( safe from some intel only settings, thanks). While the shaders and effects stepped up quite a bit from GRID2, the environments and roads seem left behind on most tracks, leaving you with an uninspired and uninteresting landscape at times. I have yet to see some of the tracks for other disciplines ( i have mostly seen the circuit-esque tracks at the point of writing), so take this with a grain of salt.			",329,49,17,48,53,2,56

												Don't buy this game if you loved GRID1. This game feels soulless, the DLCs are pretty much unusable (every DLC is a separate driving category meaning you one car (!) is a separate car class so you basically have a race only with Nissan Skylines). This game brings almost nothing new to the table and it's a step back in few points compared to GRID1 or even GRID2.			",229,39,6,37,19,1,29

												Welcome to the autosport, motherfuker.Quick sidenote: I pre-ordered quite a while ago and when it came out I generally forgot about it, so got to play it for the first time like three weeks ago, or so.I haven't played previous GRID's, so, yeah, that kinda sucks.Anyway, from the very beginning we see an awesomely made trailer, the graphics appeared to be so good that I haven't figured out at first whether it was real footage or animation. The graphics throughout the whole game is really high, and, as appeared, not too demanding: with not the toppest graphics card (AMD Radeon 7800), it easily pulled the ultra settings. The crashing cars, the dust, the rain, everything looks just so good.I didn't really care for the soundtrack, the ambient music was so-so, but I usually would play something else, apart from the game, the car sounds and stuff...I guess they're realistic? I've never been to any race in real life to say for sure but it sounded quite decent at least for me. The lady voice that goes with you through all the menu might irritate you after several tens of hours, but you anyway will be able to talk to your...team dude who tells you stuff about whether your car broke or not, your rival position and so on, I don't honestly know how he is called.I liked the control system, it was a bit difficult at first to keep in mind everything but I just got used to itThe whole game is kinda cool, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥a seasons in with difference types of racing, which looks quite professional too. I haven't really played multiplayer, so I can't judge itOverall, yeah, I enjoyed this game, the time for this was take (4 years) and in the end we get a really neat product which you can play for quite a long while.8.9/10			",161,33,5,11,14,1,17

												I can never find myself devoting anytime to this game. It's OK, but thats about the height of it. You really need a steering wheel for the game as the handling is as much twitch, as it is loose. The handling of the cars just isnt that great, and its very much flick of a coin as to whether you will get massive oversteer or understeer no matter how many times you go through the same corner. Its graphically very nice [apart from the cockpit which is all blurred], but thats about all it can hold over the likes of Game Stock Car and Race07 (which along with the various add-ons in my favourite touring car game)			",76,17,19,6,7,0,4

												Well, what can i say apart from GRID is back woohoo. Definitely feels like the original GRID, cars handle great, physics are great and although this isn't a so called ""next generation"" game it still looks and feels just right.Very well optimized as well (well at least on my machine it runs flawlessy maxxed out) but i can't see anyone having trouble running this even on older hardware, lots of graphics options and the xbox controller, as you would expect, runs right out of the box.Codies are back baby and apart from the complaints about a blurred cockpit view (which i personally don't use, i mean who drives around looking at the speedo when racing). Obviously if you drop your lighter i guess it's harder to find on the floor of the car if everything's blurred hehe.If you like the original GRID but weren't so keen on the 2nd one then get AutoSport you won't regret it. Oh and you also get up to 12 players online which of course is much more fun.			",50,1,8,0,1,0,2

												I will have to make a disclaimer upfront that I love race simulators (as at time of review, I have clocked 188 hours in Assetto Corsa), so my review of this might be biased since I would prefer realism and physics as high enjoyment factors, which of course GRID Autosport would be a huge disappointment. Says the dev before the release of this game: ""GRID Autosport would be more sim than arcade"". I am sorry, sim my♥♥♥♥♥ All the cars turn with rubber band effect; it turns and just when you thought you turned enough and starts to return the steering to neutral, the car has that tendency to swing back about 20-30% of the turning you attempted as if you are turning against a rubber band. Like seriously? No cars behave like this.Let me qualify myself. I race racing karts, played enough simulators and drove enough cars to know that cars don't behave like this. At this rate, even Initial D and Wangan Midnight would be a better game than GRID Autosport. Luckily for me, I bought this from the 2nd tier of Humble Bundle; was considering the 3rd tier that includes the season pass, all GRID 2 DLCs, and Dirt 3 Complete edition, but seeing how horrible the physics is (it is actually worse than and more unpredictable than Initial D or Wangan Midnight), I have decided against upgrading my Humble Bundle package. Now, if only Humble Bundle accepts refunds.(TL;DR) In conclusion, if you are someone like me who only enjoys realistic physics and played Assetto Corsa, then don't even touch this with a 20-foot long pole. You might consider this if you haven't touched Assetto Corsa (not sure about other sims because imho, AC seems to be the best out there and I have tried almost every other sims) before. On the other hand, if you like arcadey racing games that makes you feel like ""fast and furious"", you might want to consider this only when there is a steep discount. Otherwise, may I direct you to Initial D or Wangan Midnight games?EDIT: I should also mention that I turned off all assists in this game, so that should be as raw as how a real car should behave. Perhaps it might have been better with assists but assists should be unnecessary with decent driving skills. I also play with no assists in Assetto Corsa but cars in Assetto Corsa have more ""grip"" and predictability, just like how you would have expected if you actually race in real life, which of course this game is completely devoid of. Complete failure even as an arcade game, made worse with claims of ""more sim than arcade""; bullcrap, this is below arcade racing game category with that rubber-band turning effect.

I love the physics of the cars at low speed, with controllable wheelspin and gear change tail kick outs.Im having a blast.Thanks Codies you managed to get one right :)			",206,4,19,19,9,0,25

												This is honestly the most frustrating racing game I have ever played.You will love it if what you want out of a racing game is the choice between the slowest or second-slowest car on the grid, the slowest or second-slowest partner on the grid, and the complete inability to upgrade or improve your car at all.Yay realism. I've always said that what I most missed from other racing games was being hamstrung by mentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ partners who manage to drag the team into 3rd place EVERY SINGLE SEASON, despite me finishing 1st every race.There has not been a single minute of fun sent my way during this game. Now excuse me while I reinstall GRID 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I keep trying to get into Autosport and I just don't like it.  Grid 2 is awesome and I am going just fine on 'Medium' in that game winning almost every race,  but in Autosport it feels like I have got the detuned version of every car I drive.  From the line I get terrible acceleration even on full throttle,  and when you throw a slide the car just stops,  whereas in Grid 2 you can carry a bit more momentum.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong but I enjoyed Grid 2 heaps more than this one;  only problem with 2 is that they don't include any of the cool stuff this one does (you have to pay for Bathurst in 2,  which is a travesty for an Australian).

												Havent played it much and i have no reason to, as after playing the first few events it felt like playing a arcade racer from 10 years ago. If you like the new ""need for speed"" games then you may like it. Other than the drifting which is sort of fun the rest is below average arcade racer and best. Unless you can get for less than £5 dont bother.			",29,0,5,6,2,0,9

I was breaking extremely late so on so forth, when I was playing on medium, the other drivers just kept spinning me out on corners, as they we're extremely aggresive. so yeah this game isn't great..

												Let's be clear : I'm a fan of Codies, I think they are doing a great job usually. When Grid came out, it was, and still is, the game to have ; The career solo was great, handling was correct and the game was really fun to play in multi.Last year, they realeased probably the worst handling car game they've ever made. It was like driving on butter all the way. The multi was so terrible that I'm still wondering ""Why did they put a derby mode later on, because there's already that everywhere...?"".This year, it's the turn to Grid Autosport. I was really confused ; Already ? One year only ?But they said they have listened to us, and it will be THE game that we want.Well, the handling is great ; Not quite as good as Grid, it's more like between Grid 1 & 2. But yeah, that's more pleasing to drive.Lot of routes and destinations, this is quite enjoyable, even if all the tracks from Grid 2 are there and for several races I can see downgraded graphics there and there. But ok, it's not a next gen (current gen now) game, so I guess it's not a problem.Modeling of interior cam is back ! AND blury as hell. Like if you're driving completly wasted, you'll probably see the car like that.... A HUGE disappoitment on that, Grid 1 had those, and that was really cool !Multi is hell on earth, again... Between cheaters, stock cars and players who deliberatly run into you... because they're driving the wrong way to annoy you.... Well, this is really awfull.Please Codies, fix that ; I shouldn't be bothered by cheaters when I'm playing a game in multi on Steam....And finaly, my biggest disappoitment : Career solo.Multi is terrible, ok, so let's take my career and drive for me : Well, nuh hu.The career is, in big sum up : You are a driver, sponsors will hire you to drive a certain amount of races, which rewards you with XP.That's it.Come on Codies, where is the real career mode ? I want to have my garage, pay for my cars, CHOOSE MY CAR FOR A CERTAIN RACE ; Here, we have 2 choices from 2 sponsors. And you're stuck with 1 to 4 cars, and the choice is not really yours.The partner is a real joke, the comments are not really usefull, and despite all the energy put on this, it's really an annoying career mode. You drive for one sponsor, you're done, next.There's no challenge whith points or money earned, no big final like ""Le mans"" in Grid, no car customisation in solo, nothing.So my review is simple :If you want multi and you're willing to taste hell on the roads : this game is for you.If you want a solid solo career, I'd pass...If you want some fun, i'd wait for a discounted price.Let's prey the 4 will be THE ONE (even if it'll surely not be....)

												This game is great; they have improved on almost every aspect of Grid 2 and gone back to the games roots. I played Race driver Grid for about 200 hours when it first came out, I loved every moment of it! I found that Grid 2, while I still really liked the game it still fell short of my expectations.Well, Grid Autosport is everything I could have expected and more from a racing game! The cars feel realistic, the sound is amazing and the graphics are stunning! As for the gameplay; I would not go as far as to say this game is a racing simulator but I am not sure that is the point of Grid. Grid 2 had a very arcady feel to it; sliding around corners, bashing into people, etc; Autosport however will punish you severely for doing those kinds of things, the damage system is relentless and if you do not take the racing line or brake properly you will lose valuable seconds off your laptime through spin outs or driving off the track!The multiplayer is really entertaining; in fact I prefer it to the single player mode. You have access to every car from the get go, however they are ""Loan"" cars, so you cannot upgrade them and they typically do not perform quite as well as Brand new cars (due to their condition rating). This adds a realistic feel to the game and also inspires you to buy your own cars and tune them properly! Tuning is another important feature of this game, once you have purchased your first car and begin to race with it you will begin to unlock upgrades and tuning options to make the car perform exactly how you want it to! I found this really helps me set my cars up based on my driving style.Earning money can be tough in Grid Autosport multiplayer, however that is the point! If you crash your car or the loan car you will need to pay for repairs, this encourages you to drive sensibly, take the racing line and brake properly ( No more e-brake!) the cleaner you race, the more money you get and the closer you will get to owning your own beautiful motor car!If you liked Race driver Grid then you will love Autosport!Pros-Beautiful Graphics-Fun and Realistic gameplay-Amazing sound-Endless car tuning possibilitiesCons- Voice chat and some connection issues online- Long loading timesOverall 4.5/5			",76,20,7,19,10,0,15

												I have played this game for less than 10 hours, still, it was enjoyable and I even liked it. Now, some time ago, I installed this game again, this time with Win10, and it doesn't even launch.Spent all an evening to search some kind of solution or fix, because it doesn't start at all, I mean, when you run the .exe file, the ""steam box"" becomes green meaning that you're playing but one second later returns to normal, and the game does not launch.There isn't any help, and as long as you keep searching the chances of starting is game are under the 15-20%.I'm tired spending my time on forums, tried all methods and this crap won't start, eve if it meets the system requirements.Maybe you'll be lucky and let this thing start, but it's rather impossible if you have Windows 10 and a good PC - These are all the reasons I'm giving you an advice not to buy this game. Luckily I got this for 5 euros, however I regret that I spent 5 euros on a broken gme that won't launch even if I spent half a day searching for fixes. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME.

												Got the game after a lengthy hiatus from any sort of serious racing game since my wheel and pedal setup playing GT on PS & PS2. I'd played some pretty arcady racers on various sources including PC but honestly wanted that legit racing feel without the tediousness of some of the more intense sim racers.One thing to point out, if you're used to arcade racing games, get ready to spin out over and over. However, you should have faith. I'm playing on a 360 controller for Windows on 8.1 and setting the difficulty to the base ""Easy"" setting is giant help. It gives you the full racing line by default which shows you not only the best line on the track but also, via color changing as indication, shows you relatively how fast you need to be going for certain portions of the track. This really comes in handy when getting used to the braking in turns. This game is not a game you can simply swing your back end around the corners in. Once you begin to get the hang of it though, the whole thing becomes satisfying and rewarding. I like the way the different racing specialties are set up in the career mode. It allows you to choose from all but the GRID Autosport Series which is apparently reserved for when you've mastered all the others. As of right now, I've played through a season in both the Touring and Street series'. The Street series seems like a great place to start because the speeds don't get too much above 100mph and the cars handle well. I have yet to play any multiplayer so I will refrain from commenting on it until I get the chance to join in.VERDICT: Great game so far.			",30,0,2,1,4,0,1

												GRID Autosport feels like what GRID 2 was supposed to be. It's sort of a split between 1 and 2.For starters, you're back to the fairly open method of choosing races that was in GRID 1. You get a little board of different types of disciplines (Touring, Endurance, Open Wheel, Tuner, Street) and you can choose any of them right off the bat to dig into. They each come with different events you can sign up for, and each race has a few different sponsors you can race for, for differing amounts of XP based on how well you follow their requests. Generally, what you see is what you get in regards to what types of races you do. Touring is usually just touring car races, fast paced pack racing with you and 15 other racers. Endurance is powerful supercars that you race for 8 minutes or so. You have to watch your tire wear in this discipline, so lighter braking and safer turning. I haven't had any issue with my tires exploding on me yet (I play on the Medium difficulty) but they do tend to get close. Open Wheel is small cars that are, as you'd expect, open wheeled. So far it's been mostly Formula 3, but I haven't progressed too far in that discipline to say for sure if it'll become more. This discipline is also incredibly fun, which is a nice change from the stressful races that Open Wheel brought along in GRID 1. Tuner is light weight and small race cars and American muscle cars, which seem to be usually time attack (post the best time) races. Street is more along the lines of what you got in GRID 2 in the early tiers. There's a lot of hatchbacks and muscle cars in pack races. In addition to the above, there's a ""GRID Championship"" that unlocks after you get level 3, 6 and 9 in each of the disciplines. The GRID Championship is just all the other disciplines crammed in one event series, and gives you more experience to level the disciplines. There are also small ""cup"" events in some of the disciplines that'll pop up and break up the rest of your racing. They're small events of a few races, and the best is definitely Drift. The AI is fairly typical of a racing game. They'll still follow their line regardless of how much you're in the way. It becomes especially upsetting when they hit you, and you go spinning off the road, while their car seems to be made of dark matter. Thankfully, they don't seem to be broken when they work for Ravenwest anymore. Gone are the days of watching those black and grey cars that you know you outpower speed off and leave you in the dust.Speaking of, you don't seem to be able to have your own team anymore. You work exclusively for the highest bidder, and your codriver is whoever the team wants to stick with you. Most of the time, they're useless. You do have the ability to tell your codriver what to do, to an extent. You can tell them to defend/hold/drive normally/push/attack. Attack seems to be the only way to see them gain any positions, though, and I so rarely have them in a good place that I ask them to hold or defend, though the few times I have they lost their good position and I had to tell them to attack anyway.The handling feels a whole lot better than it did in 2. The cars have some weight to them, and the tires don't want to squeel across the road with every turn (with basic assists left on). Not being able to drift around every turn and win by massive amounts of time anymore took some getting used to, but it's wonderful. I plan on turning off all the rest of the driver assists soon to see how it feels without them.The feeling of speed seems a bit inconsistent, at least to me. Cars in Tuner and Muscle classes feel like they move really slow, despite the HUD telling me I'm going at 100mph. Then I jump in a Touring car and feel like I'm blasting along, but only doing 80. It might just be the way they handle, but it feels fairly odd. It looks good, for the most part. The tracks and the cars are well rendered. The cars have a good shine to them, the liveries look good. The damage model on them is pretty weak, though it is a step above a lot of other racers. Cars still split apart by the seams like in GRID 2, so you'll get that weird piece of body flapping like a bit of loose skin. If you tap a car in front of you going into a turn, you will get scrapes all up and down the hood, regardless of how hard you hit. Does the same on the sides of your car, and presumably on your rear. It's not really a big issue, and I understand why it was done, but it bothers me a little. The backgrounds are, as is typical of racing games, weak. Low res, 2D trees that sparcely populate ugly, jagged hills. People in the stands are straight out of an RPG on the PS2. Perhaps the biggest issue as far as visuals, is the car interiors. Maybe I looked at it wrong, but it seemed like the reintroduction of cockpit view was a big deal for this game, and they are absolutely ugly. You don't get any movement on anything but the wheel, which becomes especially noticable when you're driving stuff like the open wheel vehicles and see the speedo screen make no effort to do anything. And considering this was stuff that was in DiRT 3, it's fairly shocking.I like the game. It's got a good simcade feel that leans a bit more on the sim than the arcade, it looks good, and it plays fun. But it still feels like a step back from GRID 1. It's a step forward from 2, for sure, but there's still that gap.			",274,47,8,46,28,0,44

												7.5/10 Fair perspective. 9.5/10 Personally.It's an arcade/sim which does lean much more toward sim than arcade and is the most realistic grid game to date, the only negatives to this game are the racenet website, which you have to use to join, modify or create clubs and the cockpit view while gets the job done and still gives you that immersive feeling, really could have done with a bit more attention.The online experience is great, smooth gameplay even with players from all around the globe racing together. Great voice chat and mostly grown up drivers. There is a system that punishes players for the amount of impacts they have been in or caused which is proving to help players race more clean.As for the sim elements of the game, the cars do all have a unique weight and balance feel to them and behave differently under varying circumstances. You have to use your brakes to be competitive in this game and to set the fastest pace. Accelerating at the wrong times or under heavy cornering will produce understeer or oversteer depending on traction, this will throw you off of the racing line or apex which causes you to have to overcorrect the next corner thus, slowing you down and pushing the car to it's physical limitations to stay on the track.Underrated game in my opinion, it's a shame it's reputation was tarnished from Grid 2 and people aren't giving it a go, or it could have been one of the biggest racers to hit consoles and PC. I hope it eventually gets the credit it deserves. Well done Codemasters, I was skeptical but it has been money well spent.			",38,1,2,0,1,0,2

												If you want a proper racing simulator buy Gran Turismo 2 for PS1 and enjoy and don't touch this crap even with a mile long stick.Gran Turismo will have more vehicles, REAL endurance races (instead of drive around 4 minutes), a way better customization and tuning abilities (more later) probably more tracks, better soundtrack, better voice acting (i.e. silence which is better than a phone-sex-line-granny-trying-to-be-sexy ""Welcome back John"" every time you open the game), better driving mechanics (more later), pit stops etc. etc.Once again Codemasters make it look like a nice game but after a while you'd give away your aunt if you could just remove it from existence.Gameplay:Mechanics are something inbetween Grid 1 and 2, meaning you won't be powersliding (i.e. slowing down) all the time but anyway you'll be doing that quite a bit. I can somehow deal with it when driving a street or touring cars but FFS I DID NOT START A FORMULA SEASON JUST TO DRIFT AROUND. The open wheel cars have just the same amount of grip with a little bit lower centre of weight and more power so they'll slide just as much as your Ford Mustang or Nissan Silvia but they may be recovered from it a bit more easily. Fun for a while or for arcade racers but not a part of a ""simulator"".If using a keyboard to drive you need to have traction control on and thus (I suspect it's due to it) all other drivers are faster than you in the start.If you try to ram the opponents you end up eating mud yourself every time because they're like moving brick walls on rails. They don't give a SH** about you and your pushes if you are not in with a total kamikaze, also you have a great chance to end up spinning out every time you hit someone.The penalty system for cutting corners is complete utter bullcrap. In a same circuit you could drive 100 meters on grass and it doesn't do anything but in the next corner when you hit the kerb a bit too hard and touch the grass you'll be slowed down for something like 7 FÜGing seconds. The AI doesn't get penaltied and happily push you out of the track if you're too close so enjoy!Tuning:No.Depending on how far have you played in the career you'll have zero to a little possibilities to fine tune your vehicle. The changes are the exact same as in Dirt 3 but in Grid you may only have two options for each, 0 or 100%, depending on your team. This pretty much renders the tuning useless because unless you're looking for more sliding you aren't doing a thing with a possibility to set 100% of your braking power to rear or front tires.I also noticed that either something is terribly wrong with the open wheel cars or the game has differential lock tuning inverted, locked diff should make you slide even more but in the game open diff causes it.If you can still remember the fine tuning in GT2, I can tell you it was real high-tech. Don't even dream about something like that.Vehicles:All same group (or class) vehicles are basically the same to make them even. When you have two team offers the XP is the only thing you need to check, your team mate will always suck and the car is just a moving image with exactly the same abilities as the other one.There are something like 5 different cars in each class (except the formulas which have 1 or something) so basically you have a few to choose from but it's nothing like the hundred cars in Gran Turismos.Gamemodes:Along the basic races there are some other modes such as time attack (or something) where you have X laps to score the fastest laptime (so it's basically a qualifying but called race) endurance and drifting.Drifting was surprisingly pleasant and pretty cool but the same mechanics (meaning same controls but -100% grip) were seen in Need For Speed something like 10 years ago. It's also ridiculously easy, within a lap you can score 1,5 million points and AI scores 500-800k.Endurance races are about driving the circuit for X minutes and your tires will wear out. In addition to the ""normal sliding"" which is rather heavy you cannot brake or turn softly with a keyboard so you'll eat up your tires pretty quickly but it's fun enough. No pitstops though, would have been cool.Multiplayer is... well, online multiplayer. The lobby is plagued with an automatic voice chat which you have to switch off every time if you don't want to use it.Codemasters have a ghost car mechanic which makes everyone ghost cars when in a corner to avoid collisions and pushing but it's not working very well as it makes you visible when you're not braking heavily and thus you're again open for hits which means there will be hits just like there wasn't any ghost thing at all.Overall:I have really mixed feelings about this. I enjoy arcade racing but this isn't it. I also enjoy simulators but this isn't it either. It's not completely bad and I've had fun moments but it's not anywhere near the addictiveness and fun I had with Gran Turismo 2 when I was a kid. It isn't a best comparison but it's the last good racing simulator I've played.4/10 If you enjoy semi realistic racing and can swallow the crap they'll send you with it, you'll like this. If you're in for a good simulator or action full arcade racing, you won't find either in this one.			",41,5,3,6,9,0,11

												This has the same problems as Race Driver: Grid, at higher difficulties, the AI just cheat.I'm not talking about crazy rubber banding, but they seem to go around high-speed corners and down straights ludicrously fast, even if you're in the same car.The only hope you have of overtaking is to BTCC them in the slow corners, which doesn't feel right in supercars/open wheelers.Also don't even try to play with a wheel. I have a G29 Logitech (Grid Autosport is on the officially supported games list), and every single time you open the game, you have to rebind the wheel controls.Apparently you need to press a button on the wheel at the ""Press Start"" screen to make the game recognise the wheel, but not once have any of the buttons progressed the menu.On the plus side the force feedback has a lot of detail to it.For an officially supported >£200 piece of kit, I expect it to work out of the box. Disappointing.Sure it's a graphical and technical leap from the previous games, but it still sucks where it counts.Stick to modding Race Driver: Grid, at least you don't have to rebind the controls every time...

												I am going to vote down to this game because a network lag caused me to finish race early and people think I was cheating and kicked me. I can't even reply by text as voice is the only way to communicate in the lobby (I don't have mic with me). If it were a network problem, I should have just get kicked from the server. I would then consider it a fair response. But why on Earth did I suddenly get teleported to the pre-race grid at my current speed and hence I rushed through the finishing line? What kind of design is that?Compare this case with Trackmania II. If the result caused by network problem renders it unreasonable, the server should just void the result, at least it doesn't enrage other players. Now with my reputation marred, how am I going to continue playing this game without explanation from CodeMaster? Downvote, no choice.			",60,5,8,8,6,0,6

												First of all I am fun of simulators. Recomend for Arcade funs, not recomended for SIMULATORS FUNS.In many reviews I was reading that TOCA Race Driver 3 (2006) is coming back (TOCA 2 and Race Driver3 2006 where the best sim games what codemasters made - driving phisics. In TOCA RC3 you need to switch on ""gravel traps"" and other stuff there to get realy good driving modeling, without this is DAMMED ARCADE). In gird I thought that if I will switch off all assists game will be demanding and will have good driving model. IT IS NOT. It is realy arcade, but only ine connection with old TOCARC3 what I can see is big range of car, races eetc.I will bet if dirt rally programmers team would do GIRD Autosport, then it would be much better, because Dirt Rally is quite good not easy game. Where you can feel that you are driving 1,5 ton car not the paper box.AI and race driving tactics are focused not on tactical overtaking and knowledge but on quite brutal driving style, what can confirm for example setups for second team driver (defend-he will push cars from track when somebody will try to overtake, Attack-better not to tell...hell). So game AI are not so smart in smooth nice tactical driving like it was in RC3 or TOCA2, its always better to push somebody out of the track. In old good RC3 you and AI were getting penalities and warnings for cuting the track and agresive drivingClimat:In my opinion from codemasters the best climat was in TOCA 2 and RC3, because to make good lap time you needed to drive 500laps on one trackto learn everything, so during the race time where opponents were siting on your tail you could feel higher blood pressure because you knew that one....only onle mistake will cost of loosing all points. And more over driving model was not easy and on hard mode every cars were siting on bumpers so close to each other, it was very stresful - but this is the climat of closed track racing....I have hope that finaly Codemaster will make good game on Turning Cars Topic and GTRs with good driving morel. I think that after of big succes of Dirt Rally Codemasters has understood that the game can not be easy, more difficult game gives you more satisfaction when you will pass/win something. This is Dirt Rally....now waiting for asphalt racing....because autosport is not for me.			",22,1,5,0,5,0,0

												This is without doubt one of the worst racing games I've played in past few years. It sells itself as a fairly serious racer, but 30 seconds is enough to demonstrate the absolutely terrible floating physics - quite what they are attempting to simulate I don't know - if it's hovercraft then they've got it spot on.I had the XBox version and played it for a few hours, and actually managed to get a small amount of enjoyment out of it until about race 3 or 4 when the moronic AI finally become too much. Restarting a race 20 or 30 time just to try and avoid getting punted off by the oblivious AI as they batter their way around the track finally became too much and instead of smashing my Xbox pad I took out my rage on the disc and snapped it in half. That was a few months ago and even seeing the box on the shelf still makes me angry.Anyway, after some time away from it I thought perhaps I'd give the PC version a go for 2 reasons - 1. I can use a proper wheel and 2. I can get a refund when it inevitably turns out to be terrible. First impressions were not good as it refused to recognize a Driving Force Pro wheel pedals in the default combined layout, and I had to quit and reload 3 times to try and figure out what was up. Setting them to seperate finally got it going.Rather unsuprisingly 14 minutes from first loading the game I requested a refund. 2 laps of the first career mode race were enough to know that the physics are unbearably terrible - the car seems to rotate around a central pivot, which means from bonnet or nose cam the whole world seems to revolve around a point behind you, leading to a really weird feeling of having to steer too early and then let the slidey car sort of catch up. I thought they'd got over all this central-pivot rubbish that seemed to become apparent in the games after Colin McRae Rally 2.0, but apparently not, their physics system is just as hopeless as ever.  Also, for some reason it kept switching from bumper cam back to bonnet cam during gameplay, a bug that I also found happened on the XBox, and of course it always happens right at the worst moments. I assume even QA couldn't bear to play it for more than 2 minutes in one go to spot this obvious howler.I bought DIRT Rally a while back too after reading about just how good a sim it is, and again it soon became clear that while sliding around on dirt hides their terrible physics system to certain degree, once you get on tarmac it's just as bad as it is in this game.I skipped F1 2015 as I was frankly sick of buying the exact same game every year, and I think this is the last straw - any future Codemasters game will not be purchased as every single time I am disappointed.Despite the positive reviews in certain places, this game is completely destroyed by almost all of its competition and IMHO is not deserving of a 5/10 , let along a 9/10 as it appears to have been awarded by some reviewers.

												I was some what positive of Grid 2 however the driving of the car and the need to drift around corners felt a little strange. Well in this version Grid Autosport that is all changed. The cars now feel like they  have some weight and you need to enter corners in a somewhat controlled manner no longer are you just required to brake and drift magically around a corner. It does require some finess. I have set it to easy and this feels about right for me. No more story line this is all about xp and racing. You do have a slightly dumb team driver and he is terrible and often gets in 13 to 16 place. He was at the second spot and went all the way back to 13 once the race was over. You can give him orders to be more agressive but it seems to make little difference. The track and cars look super detailed. Not sure how accurate they are because I have never driven on them in real life. The difficulties range from super easy to easy. I will be honest I found easy to be normal I cannot imagine what normal or medium would be like. One other reviewer pointed out the fact that the AI gets a boost and that seems to be true. I still feel even with this negative the game is still good. Also be aware the AI gets a little aggressive and can sometimes spin you off the track and that is annoying. Lucky the game has a flashback system in place. So the negatives besides the ones I mentioned. The camera shake started making me ill and I had to tone it way down. Other then that it seems to be a very good driving game.Just a few more details. The endurance races are in my opinion the least fun to drive in. Its just a pain. Its at night and the tires wear down and there is no way to change said tires. Its annoying. Drifting is a pain however you can tune your car to make it able to drift around the track. So thats a plus. Gear dif. set to long and make it grip the corners and it makes it a lot easier to drift.			",299,147,32,35,36,9,44

												In terms of gameplay, Grid Autosport is fun as it can be. It brings Grid, at least for me, back to the very first game. Which if you didn't know was the best of the three, as well as being my suggestion as a starting point for a new comer. The car physics, accidents, are some of the best i have ever seen in a racing video game. Also, the selection of cars is not that great, however; they are all very different from one another and all cars have something special about them while always being great looking. This game doesn't leave without its bugs though, and there is one masive bug that doesn't sound like its going to be fixed soon. THIS GAME CAN NOT BE PLAYED FULL SCREEN. Yep you read that correctly, this game, for some odd reason, does not want to be played in full screen mode. I have no idea why. The so called ""fixes"" didn't work for me. I have learned to play windowed mode and since have been having a fair amount of fun in it.Sadly Steam does not let me put a review that goes in between bad and good, so becuase of the no full screen option that sounds like it would be an easy fix for Codemasters, much like Dirt 3 runs perfectly on the same rig of mine, then i can not in my right mind give this game a thumbs up leaving me with this sour taste in my mouth only a few hours after purchasing it.

												Plays good, I was having fun as were other's in the group.If you thought it was just same ol GRID2 you would be mistaken and that this is how GRID2 should have been.Much better control of the cars and more realistic feeling handeling (At least that what I thought on my G27)The sounds and car engine's are just soooooo much better this time around the gargle from the V8's is spot on.While this is not a sim grade racer its not your typical arcade racer either maybe we could call this simcade I think that suits.I did enjoy Grid2 having said that I do belive this to be a much better quality game thou the AI as usual can be a little frustrating at times.In my opinion it was a good value purchase having now played 76hours in game and still enjoying it.It has had much attention from the dev's and plenty of updates / patches with the dev's in the Steam forums asking questions about what we like and dislike want and dont want in this game.

												The handling of the cars is a bit more realistic cmpared to Grid 2 but it gets very repetitive. For almost every race there is a qualifier and then you have to race round the same track twice. Also there is a very limited range of cars to choose from as they are given by the sponsor.Overall, it gets boring and there are better racing games to spend your money on.			",71,7,3,4,4,0,2

												It's a great game but as soon as you hit ANYTHING the steering is damaged. I have not done a online race yet without getting my steering damaged on the first lap because people ram each other so much. It's impossible not too. The cars feel like they have giant magnits on the front of them and just sttracted to each other. The white line rule also is pretty annoying too. Sometimes you get pushed over then it slows you down to top it off. Annoying for the sake of it and adds nothing to the game.			",62,11,6,4,19,2,21

												The turning mechanics are literally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I don't understand how race cars can turn worse than regular cars, but these folks have managed to simulate that. Luckily, this was just a game that came with humble bundle. Graphics are great, the menu is garbage, I just want to get into a race without having to also plan out a career, but throw that plan out the window because this is more like a racing manager game as well as a meh at best racing game. I've played way better games with actually functional mechanics, and I'm also an automotive mechanic and this is not how vehicles drive. That's fine, this game basically only cost me a dollar for it and all the DLC, otherwise, I would never recommend this game. I'm more let down by the fact that the reviews on top didn't really explain any of this, but like I said, this game was practically free and completely disappointing. I'll give it a try again in the future, but for now it's a definite no recommendation from me.			",121,12,4,14,7,1,1

I would and would not recommend this game.For some reason my hours have not been updated on the time I played this game, and I have played over 10hours of this game so far, so I am confused by eh ho!Lets start simple and then get some detail.Graphics are nice and clean polished out.Audio is car noises, really it is nothing special or amazing it's a car game...Controls are the same as other racers, keyboard and mouse or controller and I chose the controller as it handled better and easier to play.Now the game.  If you like to drive on the inside view like me, then you now can in Grid BUT and it's a big BUT.  There is no detail, literally a blank crappy steering wheel with a literally shape style dash board, there is NO speedo or gauges (How ever it is spelt) or anything just a black shaped canvass to mimic the dashboard.  FAIL!Car control: The cars feel weird like driving into a control at 100Mph and it looks like 30Mph but the engine is screaming.... you turn in at 60 and it slide a little bit but responds soooo quickly unlike any other game.  Literally brake? No! All you do is role around corners literally role because you do not need a break.  I been winning races with no HUD at all and I mean nothing on, never touching the break and roling around the corners which is annoying.Literally the cars handle like ice, sliding around things quickly.There is a nice feature which is the second monitor feature which allows you to see a scoreboard and different viewing angles when driving, but when I turned this on the game played terrible and was super laggy, but I am unsure if this is because I have the main monitor at ultra 144Hz so I do not know.  Just still unplayable with that on and a nice feature at the end of the day.If you like racing games then maybe this might suite you.  I love and enjoy racing games but I found playing this the same as others and offering nothing new.  Literally nothing new, and it feels like I've played this before (Grid 2) and I am bored of playing it after 2hours but thought to soldier on and play more and more.The mutliplayer is where the fun is if you get a lobby where people race correctly and do not ram the hell out of you.  Ghost mode ACTIVATED! Drive through me now!Really the game has tons and tons of these and no one really drives like a correct race is supposed to and that bores me, specially having to create a ghost lobby to stop the rammers makes it unrealistic but then seeing the car control it makes it okay.It literally feels like a DLC from Grid 2.  Really it's nothing special or new and that bores me and lets the game down!Would I recommend this game? Yes and no but sadly I cannot choose these two options.  If you like a 5minute drive around a track then avoid this, but if you are a die hard racer who loves ALL racing games then play this.  I like it do not get me wrong but playing this expecting something new is the wrong way to see it and for that I cannot play anymore but I will really try.			",868,187,72,84,117,12,187

												I have tried so hard to like this game after playing grid 2 but it aint as good! hate how they have split the racing up in to 5 sections! drifting is awful and endurance mode is the worse game mode in a car game ive seen! 6 min races with the last laps with no tyre wear! cars handling is terrible compared to G2! Multi player does not exsist and if you do get into a game you will just get crashed into all the time! and I payed £30 for this, a month odd after release its the deal of the day for £15! buy ♥♥♥♥nd dirt 3 instead or for a proper sim get assetto corsa or wait till 80% off!

												The turning mechanics are literally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I don't understand how race cars can turn worse than regular cars, but these folks have managed to simulate that. Luckily, this was just a game that came with humble bundle. Graphics are great, the menu is garbage, I just want to get into a race without having to also plan out a career, but throw that plan out the window because this is more like a racing manager game as well as a meh at best racing game. I've played way better games with actually functional mechanics, and I'm also an automotive mechanic and this is not how vehicles drive. That's fine, this game basically only cost me a dollar for it and all the DLC, otherwise, I would never recommend this game. I'm more let down by the fact that the reviews on top didn't really explain any of this, but like I said, this game was practically free and completely disappointing. I'll give it a try again in the future, but for now it's a definite no recommendation from me.			",121,12,4,14,7,1,1

												Grid Autosport is a fun racer. Some game modes bring a lot of entertainment.It is a lot better than Grid 2 IMO.Ai does everything that is NOT allowed on a track, blocking, cutting, dangerously returning to track, brake testing, ramming and catching. %)Some (super) cars are insane to drive.Game has some issues with online stability or stuttering image. For the rest it runs like clockwork.Wheel support is excellent. Lots of feel and no need for adjusting. Everything works from the box. And button layout can be customized off course.

												This a big step backwards from GRID 2. While it looks and plays much the same there is really no customisation options at all.Your not creating your on team here so theres no personalised livery's, no cars to be won or earned just driving so basically all your experience earns you is access to more races. Pick you sponser, drive the tracks, repeat. This may be a more accurate simulation of the ""world of professional Motorsport"" but for me it lacks anything to motivate me to continue. That said If your into racers you may enjoy it. it is a well made racing sim but if your more of a casual racer your probably going to find this a bit dull.			",224,21,14,13,21,5,10

												Major game breaker: unshakable AI despite having the 'faster' car - they always outrun you on straights.Pros:- Nice graphics, but of course, i'm running on a GTX780Ti with a 1440p screen, so maxed out everything without issues.Cons (other than the ♥♥♥♥ed up AI):- Controls doesn't save. Using an adapter with my old Dualshock 2 controller, when i set to the Direct Input Device preset, the buttons doesn't work for the menu, and i do not know what the keyboard shortcut is. When i switch back to a keyboard preset and map the keys to my controller, everything is fine until i quit and start the game, then i have to remap everything again.- Understeers like a cow, oversteers like a dog on ice. You make settings which you think should counter those problems - but no, the game thinks otherwise and you end up making the car worse.- Another AI problem♥♥♥♥♥physics. You car weighs as a car should. The other cars weighs like a ♥♥♥♥ing 100ton tank each. You push them hard and they refuse to budge, them tapping you slightly and you go sliding off the road, which brings me to my next point...- Penalties. So, it has become my fault that the ♥♥♥♥ed up AI pushes me out despite me having the line, and i get a ♥♥♥♥ing penalty for that?- AI related issue again. No matter how hard you try, the AI will always out-accelerate you at a stop-start.- Physics♥♥♥♥♥AI. Me, car. Them car. I ram them I damage, they ram me, I damage. Them ♥♥♥♥ing driving a tank?Fortunately, i bought this while it was on a discount.But damn Codemasters, what the ♥♥♥♥ are you doing? Race Driver: GRID was a damn nice game. GRID 2 was a little disappointing, and now this? sheesh, you becoming the 2nd Ubisoft where you gonna just churn out games hoping people will buy them?			",117,7,5,14,22,0,14

Posted: June 28, 2014
												This is a racing game made for racers.  People who genuinely love motorsports.  People who have actually DONE motorsports before.  People who know what racing really is like in real life. This review is written having only played the game with a G27 racing wheel and only manual sear shifting with all HUD's disabled for the most racing like experience.I've done my fair share of track days and i can tell you, think is the most realistic car racing game i have played.  There's plenty of people complaining the game feels too slow, the cars don't grip in corners blah blah.  Well guess what, those people have never driven on a track in their life.  When on a racing track, unless you're in a ultra fast ferarri or koensigg or something, guess what, you feel SLOW.  That's how it is.  Your car is slow.  People are so used to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ car sims that put so much emphasis on feeling like you're flying along or arcade racing games that let you go around corners at 400kph that they have no idea what it's actually like to race a car. So more on the good parts.  The handling of the cars:Fantastic.  Cars handle how they should. FWD understeers coming too hot into a corner, or if you put power down coming into a corner and you can even get the♥♥♥♥♥out with lift off oversteer when driving really agressive.  All of that is true in a FWD cars handling characteristics and they are all spot on in the game.  RWD cars oversteer if you power on too much mid corner, or over a crest.  You can really feel the suspension working.  Coming super hot down a hill into a banked corner?  Your suspension will start to wallow like a real car trying to deal with sideways g-forces, and if not careful in a RWD car, will cause oversteer.  Graphics: AMAZING.  Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥  The attention to detail is amazing.  From the different exhaust outputs of the cars (some will be obviously running rich, some not, etc) to the in car view of the dash being out of focus (because you're looking at the track, not the car) but obviously having some type of MOTEC carbon fiber HUD in place of the standard cars one, to the general cars decals and body panels.  The world around looks so gorgeous, beautiful lighting, amazing scenery, and really perfect track textures. Racing modes:The only thing the game is missing in terms of racing modes is drag racing and rally.  Which is not a downside to me.  Drag is always a short lived interest in racing games and rally is much a massive part of racing it really does require its own game.One massive thing to note is the different racing game modes all have different racing styles.  Touring cars are mega aggressive, open wheelers really require you to be careful with damage on and time attack is like how time attack is with sporadic cars you have to deal with.  Sounds:I love the fact you can hear the tyres gripping, the straight cut gears int he gear box and the pop from fuel injectors still being on when your changing gears, because screw fuel efficiency.Its the little things:To me what really makes this game great is the little things.  Like picking a perfect line through a series of corners then coming out and realising you just shaved a second or 2 off your lap time.  The spectators not being 2d, the clouds and lighting are so gorgeous and the cars look amazing. Even the simple and elegant UI still keeping perfect functionality.  The fact you log in, and the game says with voice ""Welcome back (name here), there's some new events in the touring car championship, go check them out!"".  You can really tell Codemasters have really put their heart and soul into this game.Summary:If you're a grown adult that loves racing, and has done it before, this is the game for you.  If your some pimply teenager that thinks GTA and Need for Speed are racing simulators, this isn't for you.			",89,13,4,10,13,0,8

												This game is very great in a lot of ways. The graphics are simple but crisp and modern at the same time. Game graphics are very realistic as are the car mechanics. Sounds of the cars could be more realistic, I have drove some of the cars in the game in real life, they just don't sound the same. To sum up, its an overall great game and is a good subsite from Forza Motorsport.			",13,1,3,0,4,0,0

												Not significantly better than Grid 2, despite the hype. Graphics no better. Handling is still just as broken and floaty(but in a very slightly different way). Other cars are still 'sticky' and far 'heavier' than player car leading to endless frustration after what should have been minor and insignificant contact. Meh.			",36,3,5,0,4,0,3

												TL;DR = Arcade-like experience that offers short lived entertainment that which is NOT worth at its current listing.I received this game as a free download with the purchase of new computer hardware.  With that said, it is an adequate racing game with many of the bells and whistles that one might come to expect.  However, playing it many a time in solo career mode as well as the split screen co-op mode, both my co-op partner and I had to point out multiple times that the game leaves something to be desired.[[[LOTS OF CARS!]]] Kind of.  They all behave the same way in my eyes.  Don't get me started on these ""drift-tuned cars"", I can't figure that nonsense out for the life of me.*  But of course, having the trademark performance cars and Indycars and the like are all fine fun.  Then we have Supercars and Hypercars.  More on that later.          *=Probably just terribad.  Co-op partner always flipped me over and f*cked me sideways when she consistently beat me at the ""drift"" races.[[[PHYSICS!]]]I don't know about this one.  Maybe it's because my ~80 hours logged is primarily devoted to the co-op mode, I likely don't have a reliable opinion.  But there were times when my partner's car slid, literally from left to right, as if being yanked by a piston on a conveyor belt.  Of course, when that didn't happen, our reckless driving often jettisoned our very expensive Hypercars hilariously into the air.  Otherwise, we would be skidding across the track at hairpin turns.  TO BE CLEAR, this is not the fault of the game or the engine; this is user experience in the CO-OP mode.Beyond those elements, I have little to offer for review.  Other reviews would more adequately describe the AI and the Career mode.  As I said, most of my experience is in split screen co op, and so my opinion may be wholly unreliable.  And again, I received this game for free.  Would I recommend buying this game for $39.99?  No; maybe if it was under $10.  Only under the circumstance in which the user could come upon this game at a low price point, or for free, do I recommend it.			",59,6,1,4,11,0,3

You get a cleaner UI, track visuals, and upgraded environmental physics. The improvements to career mode are pretty special too. I love the sponsors and unlockable content. But the AI really shines here. They can do some pretty unsavory things. I'm talking down-right obnoxious stuff. They're fun to race against...even if they knock me off the tracks...4 times in 1 race.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played Grid and Grid 2. This game is not as bad as some people say. Sure you can't buy your own cars, but that can be seen as a positive. You get to drive different cars and experience a range of different racing styles. In-car view is my favorite. First 2 games of the series I tried to race with the outside views only and in events like drifitng that was really bad, because I would always either under or over estimate car's speed and porximity to the corner. That would result in epic frustration and poor drift scores. In this game I was able to do cool drifts right in my first drifting event. Very positive emotions so far. Also the AI is not as homicidal as it was in Grid 2, so I can't complain. Overall I like this game and would recommend getting it on a sale.			",66,4,5,5,0,0,4

												Codemasters really disappointed me on this one. The first thing that caught my attention were the terrible graphics in the cockpit. It's like 140p on the inside, you can't see the gear, the reflections off the mirror are so low res that they are practically useless because you can't actually see who's behind you. Cockpit view is also unplayable because you can barely hear the sound of your engine to know what gear you're in / when to change. The AI can be really aggressive at times and there doesn't appear to be a noticable difference in graphics from Grid 2. However the game is fun to play, the racing physics are realistic, and the graphics look good overall.			",3,0,1,0,0,0,0

												Not as fun as GRID 2. I'm not sure if it's because it's more realistic or what, but I'm finding the car handling to be a lot stiffer, and acceleration a lot more handicapped against the AI (even on maps when we are driving the exact same cars). It also penalizes you greatly for aggression by stalling your engines, so... Not as fun, from my personal perspective.			",113,17,4,8,4,0,9

												This game is great. From a simulation stand point, it is realistic but not so much so that the game is no longer entertaining. It requires a basic knowledge of racing, but still preserves a lot of the fun in many other arcade games. And if the right difficulty is chosen, being in the pack is not frustrating at all but rather challenging and entertaining.There is one major concern I find though, that that is that the game crashes after a short while (15 minutes around), so until that is fixed it might be worthwhile holding off on a full price purchase.Overall, good game, definitely worth playing, just careful of the bugs.

												I play alot of racing simulators but i actually enjoy the ""arcade"" aspect to this game every now and then.Graphics and sound are good and theres enough content to keep you occupied.The game has 2 major flaws though....1: The force feedback gets stuck sometimes and can vibrate without reason for up to a minute.2: The AI drivers are incredibly bad. Normally, in almost any racing game since the late 90`s, if you overtake on the inside of a corner, the AI driver usually brakes or atleast try to avoid a collision but in this game they follow the racing line like a train follows the rails. They just slams into you..... I play the game on the hardest difficulty without any driving assists so i really have to push it to come out in 1:st place in many of the races and since the AI drivers makes every overtake a dangerous one it just takes alot of the fun out of the game. I like the fact that an overtake isnt easy but if you follow the rules and dont ""cut"" people of and such, they shouldent just slam into you.I still recommend the game though!

												This game presents itself as a realistic racer with nice graphics, real world racing teams, and vehicle tuning. The problem is that the physics engine is still the super arcade engine from previous GRID games. The arcade style physics feel really out of place in F1 cars especially. The game also gets extremely repetitive very quickly. The career mode is nothing but circuit racing, with the occasional drift tournament in Tuner, in various cars. Alternate styles of race, such as Drag and Sprint, are DLC. You also have almost no options when it comes to vehicle choice for races. You are given the option between two sponsors with 1 or 2 cars each. A lot of the teams have no tuning options whatsoever.I did purchase the Drag DLC in order to see what the fuss was about. The DLC is highly disappointing. There are nine additional tournaments but they have no impact on your Career OR Online progress in any way. Vehicle options are also extremely limited.If you are looking for a realistic racer, or any kind of variety, look elsewhere. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Grab the drag pack for it as well, it's cheap and is loads of fun with friends... Overall 4 out of 5 but only due to the fact that it has more of an ""arcadey"" feel to it rather than realistic sim..

												Great fun, but the lack of penalty system makes the game alot more arcady. The DLC strategy is a joke, alot of small DLC's that splits the community, with the few numbers of players the DLC's are splitting them up wich makes it hard to find online games and/or players sometimes.Next time CM maybe could add the tracks for free and cars as DLC, you can still race with DLC people but not buy or use the DLC cars. Alot of player are scared to buy the games since the need to buy alll DLC to be able to race...			",116,8,24,2,33,0,7

												I play alot of racing simulators but i actually enjoy the ""arcade"" aspect to this game every now and then.Graphics and sound are good and theres enough content to keep you occupied.The game has 2 major flaws though....1: The force feedback gets stuck sometimes and can vibrate without reason for up to a minute.2: The AI drivers are incredibly bad. Normally, in almost any racing game since the late 90`s, if you overtake on the inside of a corner, the AI driver usually brakes or atleast try to avoid a collision but in this game they follow the racing line like a train follows the rails. They just slams into you..... I play the game on the hardest difficulty without any driving assists so i really have to push it to come out in 1:st place in many of the races and since the AI drivers makes every overtake a dangerous one it just takes alot of the fun out of the game. I like the fact that an overtake isnt easy but if you follow the rules and dont ""cut"" people of and such, they shouldent just slam into you.I still recommend the game though!

												TL;DR = Arcade-like experience that offers short lived entertainment that which is NOT worth at its current listing.I received this game as a free download with the purchase of new computer hardware.  With that said, it is an adequate racing game with many of the bells and whistles that one might come to expect.  However, playing it many a time in solo career mode as well as the split screen co-op mode, both my co-op partner and I had to point out multiple times that the game leaves something to be desired.[[[LOTS OF CARS!]]] Kind of.  They all behave the same way in my eyes.  Don't get me started on these ""drift-tuned cars"", I can't figure that nonsense out for the life of me.*  But of course, having the trademark performance cars and Indycars and the like are all fine fun.  Then we have Supercars and Hypercars.  More on that later.          *=Probably just terribad.  Co-op partner always flipped me over and f*cked me sideways when she consistently beat me at the ""drift"" races.[[[PHYSICS!]]]I don't know about this one.  Maybe it's because my ~80 hours logged is primarily devoted to the co-op mode, I likely don't have a reliable opinion.  But there were times when my partner's car slid, literally from left to right, as if being yanked by a piston on a conveyor belt.  Of course, when that didn't happen, our reckless driving often jettisoned our very expensive Hypercars hilariously into the air.  Otherwise, we would be skidding across the track at hairpin turns.  TO BE CLEAR, this is not the fault of the game or the engine; this is user experience in the CO-OP mode.Beyond those elements, I have little to offer for review.  Other reviews would more adequately describe the AI and the Career mode.  As I said, most of my experience is in split screen co op, and so my opinion may be wholly unreliable.  And again, I received this game for free.  Would I recommend buying this game for $39.99?  No; maybe if it was under $10.  Only under the circumstance in which the user could come upon this game at a low price point, or for free, do I recommend it.			",59,6,1,4,11,0,3

Posted: August 18, 2014
												After waiting many weeks after the release of this game i decided to break down an throw more money into the Codemaster's pool of racing games. As many do now a days, i searched the web of pre-access user videos and reviewers to see how the in-game play would be. So before even purchasing i could tell there would be a lot of things i wouldn't like about the game, and somethings i would.  Overall this game is not worth the price it is going for, there are so many things that are off about this game or just not worth the value. If you still need a reason why you shouldn't buy it, keep reading.I own and play many codemaster games( F1 2010-13 , Grid, Dirt 2,3) so i have a good idea of how Codemasters work SHOULD be, but it seems they decided to cut every corner possible in this game. The AI, the physics, the track design/layout, have all been half arsed in comparison to the other games they have made, specifically F1 2013 which is by far the best version to date. It's strange to even think that this game is even made by the same people unless you look real close at some of the details in this game. My biggest gripe with this game, is the horrible attempt of the interior design of the vehicles, it's unbelievable how little f*cKs were given when they put these vehicles together. Considering games like Shift 2, forza 3-4 , which were made years ago, have superb interior and exterior design and a lot more cars! So there really isn't any reason for the excuse the designers may have.Some may still have an issue with the driving physics including myself, but i will say it can be pretty fun (like 20 minutes fun) when sliding about and buzzing of into the distance. Plus it's not like its uncontrollable, so i'm not going to knock on that door to much. Yes the problem is that tje they drifted towards....drifting physics, allowing the car to get extremely tail happy and overly dramatic body roll (tilt and lean) is apart of normal turning style, but in some cases it's a bit much considering that even the extreme formula cars suffer from snap oversteer and understeer if you don't get it just right.One thing that is decent about the game, is the basic tuning parameters. Even if you're a noob when it comes to vehicle tuning( unlike Forza where you have to be just shy of a mechanical engineer), you can get a sense of (hot or cold) when it comes to picking the right settings, and even if you are cold when it comes to choosing the right balance, you aren't severly punished on track, yes your times will be off but you now know why and can easily change it accordingly.But my last issue comes down to the detail in resolution. Its simply not there, there are still many areas through out the game that are simply too pixelated or not optimized. This may be a gripe with people who have spent a lot of money on their gaming rigs and want the best, of the best of the best, and for us this is not. It seems to me this game was probably meant to work well for people who have basic or mid range computers, so I can see where over a wider audience why it has been optimized at this level. Even maxed out on all settings my computer doesn't even break a sweat, which means there is a lot of graphical computing that is still bottled away to keep from killing users computer's. Though i've yet come across glitching issues, which some people like, to me it means not to many areas have been pushed to its maximum potential. A good example of this is Ubisoft games, they crash like hell and glitch like no other, but for the 15 minutes it plays, the quality is superb!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												From the first race i have never felt like this was a bad purchase. compared to the last game, Grid 2, which had an appauling handling engine that made every car serverely hard to control. but in this game they seemed to fix all the issues from the last. There are more event types (not just sprint and race), more tracks, more cars and dlc that is worth the purchase. The only way this title could be better is if it was less of a simulator, but then its not Grid anymore.			",61,7,7,6,20,1,6

												I can only run this game in Window-mode, and not in full-screen. And please do not come with the ALT+ENTER combo because this will not fix the problem. The only way to fix this is to run Borderless-gaming so it make the game in Full-screen. I also have some contact with Codemasters, but they will not help me, the only thing they can say to me is send me a file from DXDIAG, but they don't give me any answer. (My screen has a resolution off 3200 X 1800) but GRID Autosport is the only game that give me this problem...			",55,0,4,1,1,0,2

												I mainly purchased this game because I loved GRID 2 and I thought it would be great with my sim as it now has a cockpit view. I don't know why, but driving with a wheel and a 6-speed gear doesn't feel as good as it did in GRID 2. GRID 2 was also A LOT easier than this; I feel like I get demolished even on easy. I would definitely recommend getting this game, but only for people that enjoy a super-realistic game where you need to do really well to win (which I don't; why I loved GRID 2).

												Don't base your opinion on what Grid 2 was like. This game is at least 100x bteer. They really sorted the handling model out in this one. The car and track selection is still as good as ever and the different disciplines make the game very diverse. The online portion of the game is highly addictive aswell. 10/10 from me.

												As someone who's never owned a previous Grid game, I've enjoyed it so far.I haven't had any problems with the handling or controls, but some more steering wheel options would be nice.I wish there was an option to not have the cockpit out of focus, but I'm not bothered by it.My only real complaint is with the single player AI being too reckless. It's one thing to defend and another to completely disregard the players existence.			",82,19,9,1,3,0,0

												Grid Autosport succeeds where Grid 2 failed and is nearly an even match for the original Grid. AI is excellent though often ruthless, car control is accurate but exaggerated, tracks have all been seen before but boast many new layouts, pavement has nuance, and damage has consequences. I’m struck by how consistently the AI races. Once the difficulty is dialed in, every mistake you make pushes your rivals ahead and every perfect line reels them in. Passing a racer is always the slowest line around a corner and I can see the affect it has on me in relation to the cars ahead and behind. It’s brilliant. The race menus are all new for Grid Autosport. Events are organized into seasons that encompass one discipline at a time and must be completed before switching to another. You freelance yourself out to racing teams like in the old contracts system in Grid 1. Each season could be as few as 2 races or as many as 8-10, and can include a wide variety of vehicles. Season offerings are numerous and allow you to lean on disciplines you enjoy and do the minimum in disciplines you don’t. Different race teams set different goals and award more or less points accordingly but, more importantly, different teams offer different cars to align with your preferences in the same races. The points increase your level in each separate discipline and progress you into faster and faster cars. Seasons are competitive enough that you can afford to have numerous non-first finishes and still win so long as you’re near the top. Individual races typically have a 10 minute practice session, a 3 lap qualifying, neither of which can be restarted, and a race which can be restarted. Practice and qualifying can get a bit tedious but are optional. Short comings are few. I wish I could command my own race team and create my own liveries but you could argue that that’s what multiplayer allows you to do. And though there are many new track layouts, you’ve seen all of these locales before in Grid and Grid 2. New facades would have been welcome. I’d say the game is most enjoyable with an xbox360 controller but delicacy on the triggers tires my knuckles which makes the G27 a more comfortable, if not leisurely, choice. Highly recommend.

												Grid 2 is good. This game tried to make it better by adding team mates. I bought a copy so that I could race with my friend online as a team mate... like it described on their website (split screen - woo!) but no... no co-op gaming for you!Instead, we have to put up with the most idiotic AI team mate possible. When you're in first place, they're in last. When you're in last, they're in first. You can't train them, or improve them... you just have to figure out how to cheat the programming, and hope they don't wreck themselves on a slight bend.Not worth it. It's a major gripe on the forums. Save your money for Grid 3... maybe.			",239,97,9,26,29,3,49

There are more event types (not just sprint and race), more tracks, more cars and dlc that is worth the purchase. The only way this title could be better is if it was less of a simulator, but then its not Grid anymore.			",61,7,7,6,20,1,6

												IMO, it feels like someone got really lazy when they got to the ""resolution setting"" part of making a PC game... The game force streaches to my 4:3 monitor's shape when I set it to play at a 16:9 res with 16:9 screen ratio, Other games work it out just fine, this is the only game I'v ever had a issue with in that. although the game is quite pretty when at high settings.The controles for keyboard are just terrible untill you've played for a race or two (each time you play). you tap the A or D keys for half a second and your car is nearly sideways because it instantly goes full turn.So in my opinion, and in my situation of having a 4:3 monitor and no stearing wheel, it's not really worth the 50$ I would have paid if it wasn't on sale for 25$. and even for 25$ I'd kinda rather have my money back than have the game... :/Although if you do enjoy the game there is a good amount of game to play.Just my opinion. Also, I bought this hoping for something a little more like GranTurismo so it may just be that talking... or that this makes me think of NFS Pro street, which is a game I liked even less than this game.

Any contact with other cars seems to put you in a slide and spin. The physics when you're rubbing behind another car seem to disappear and your rear steps out as if you hit a sheet of ice.Its an ok game, but be sure to keep the rewinds, ready for when the AI decides to put plough into your side when you're holding the racing line			",141,21,7,3,12,0,37

												Very emersive racing game. Not quite a sim but still very compelling handling as aposed to some racing games which over exagerate the handling. Nice visuals however not much detail for the interiors. AI is competative with spacial aweness so they dont just drive through you.			",64,5,9,5,8,0,3

												I've gone through what seems to be an endless list of patches till this day of posting and still the game is still able to astound me with the constant bugs. Critical: 5 BSOD events during playing the game itself. Playing the older Grid 2 yields hours of interrupted gameplay, or anything else for that matter. Then lose all your progress from starting the game before the crash. Cons: 1. AI: Can concur with most that the AI is behaving in an unruly manner, especially ones by Ravensport. What's more as easily they can spin you out, you can't retaliate effectively by PIT because they seem to be immune from pushing? 2. Downforce + Grip: I can expect the Touring cars to be slidy, but a F312 Dallara acts like its driving on ice. Or things one would expect to have more default downforce. Also AI seems to be able to slide at speed, while player cannot. 3. Tuning: Inital mid level tuning is too coarse for some courses. It should be full tuning at all times or never at all. Tuning isalso a cure for the poor grip/downforce on the F312 for example. 4. The nag everytime a season ends. If I wanted it to be harder, I would be playing Asseto Corsa with a phone keypad. Or drive a real car. Just saying.5. Endurance: At the shortest length, the tyre wear is overly much. If it happened in real life, you would sue the tyre company. Also losing grip means driftiness, but the controls won't allow finessed drifting, thus crashes occur. Pros: 1. First time I had an opportunity to drive Aussie V8 supercars. I now understand why the country is divided into before races. 2. Discipline variety: Keep alternating to relive the tedium of driving on the same tracks in every possible direction. Like the old days of NFS underground. Surprisingly apart from the speed, one can drive the same way  between all categories. Since I would not be able to finish the game without crashes every other race, this game is a reminder of my own folly of buying a pre-order sim from CM ever.			",47,8,7,0,6,0,2

												Grid Autosport showed a lot of promise.The driving mechanics are good for thise category of SimCade racers, and the car choices are varied, but the game suffers from a bug that still to this day haven't been fixed.If you, like me, have a Laptop that uses an Inted HD Graphics 4000 for ""low-stress"" economical useage, and a nVidea GTX 880m for gaming, then the game will not launch in, and can't even run in, Full-screen.This is a basic mechanic of the game that should work, and in a world where even low-budget indies can make games accomodating these kinds of setups, a AAA racer that can't doesn't get my recommendation.Codemasters. Do it properly, I know you can make some good games.			",66,9,23,2,10,2,15

												SE16 Review #1 | GRID Autosport (PC)When the first GRID game came out, it was a step foward for racing games. The new feature of being able to rewind and replay at an exact point, was followed by games such as Forza. GRID 2 was a litte bit of a let down, however, GRID Autosport has re-gained that pure racing magic that the original game had. It is based of 5 categories, Touring (BTCC, DTM), Open Wheel (F3, Indycar), Endurance (Prototype, Classic), Tuner (Drift, JDM) and Street (Hypercars, Super Cars). It is a very well layed out and beautiful game with perfect compatibility to most sterring wheels, including my one, the Logitech G27. The DLC packs are alos great, being cheap and mostly on sale for half price, and also featuring great content such as new tracks and vehicles. GRID Autosport brings back the true feel for racing games, definantly worth the money.Overall Rating: 8/10Reviewed By: Slenderenderon16 (SE16)			",13,3,12,0,11,0,0

												Another in a string of dissapointments from Codemasters. They used to be one of the top racing game makers. Now, it seems like every year things get worse. The original GRiD was actually quite good except for two flaws: the inexplicable stacks of tires along the walls and the flashback feature. You couldn't see the tire stacks so you would drive a normal racing line, going near the walls, and then BAM you're wrecked. The flashback was a nice concept, but it ultimately failed because it never went back far enough.The 2004/2005 rally game was the last good one they made. The F1 games were disappointing, GRiD 2 was horrible, and the DiRT series tried but ultimately failed, especially DiRT 3. It was great that 3 brought back more rallying, but Gymhkana 'hoonigan' events, seriously? Games are supposed to be fun, and that's not fun, it's just stupid.GRiD Autosport seems to be an attempt to recapture some of the first GRiD game's fun factors. It doesn't do that. The controls are snappy, unnatural, and unpredictable. With oriignal GRiD, it was start up and play, Not with Autosport. It suffers, as many current driving games do, from 'current-gen overdone graphics lag,' which is my way of thinking about how developers feel compelled these days to ignore physics and animate each little frame when moving from one position to another at the expense of response time and realism. When it takes half a second for the game to respond to me pressing the button for reverse view, that's a big warning flag. What ends up happening is that the steering responds slowly and then more quickly, not in a linear fashion. This causes you to stop steering (or countersteering) when you see the right time to do it, but by the time you see it, it's already too late and you've overdone it. Then you try to counter (or counter-counter) that which only makes it worse. Thinking it was because I was using a gamepad controller, I tried my Logitech G27 wheel. Same thing. It's an unfortunate side effect of the capabilities of graphics display and engines and such being well beyond the capabilities of developers and the physica processing. Older games don't do that, but every game equating to PS3 and Xbox360 does, along with their PC equivalents. Yet we keep buying what Codemasters makes so I guess they accomplished their goals. For me, this is the last Codemasters game I will ever buy. Sad ending to a relationship going back to the first CMR game. Fortunately I still have CMR 2005 and play it regularly, TOCA 2 is still a lot of fun, and even DiRT 2 is at least enjoyable, if unrealistic and lacking in relevant driving modes. But having fun is what a game is all about, and those games deliver.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: June 28, 2014
												Let me start by pointing out that I do not own Grid 2 and only ever played it for less than 5 minutes, so I can't make any comparison between these two. Grid Autosport is a good racing game, and when I say that, I mean that it's a fun game, in which the racing feels fast, fierce, fun, challenging, and rewarding. It does not feel like reality, but it isn't one of those over the top arcade racers either. Overall, the racing is fun and satisfying. The AI is tough, sometimes even a bit over the top, especially in the touring car races. However, I'd much rather have overall tough competition and feel like I've fought and raced hard for every point, than go through a grid full of cars going on rails, not bold enough to challenge the human player. The only problem I have with the AI is that your team mate seems to be pretty much rubbish every single race, which leaves you fighting for the team championship alone. I've only done the first few seasons, so perhaps this will change later on. Nevertheless, I would very much like my team mate to be the biggest challenge in any race, which is not the case at least at the moment. The graphics are nice enough, I doubt anyone has much complaints about them. The cockpit view, as stated a gazillion times everywhere, is not as good as it should be, but it's there nevertheless. I don't mind the blur or the bad textures inside the car, however I do find it annoying that looking around will flip the view straight to sideview, instead of smoothly ""turning your head"". You can remove the blur by the way, with some tweaks to the game files (google). The textures won't get any better though, neither will the displays start functioning. Like I said, to me it's just not important. I do understand that some people feel otherwise. For me, it does the job.The handling is probably not quite perfect, but as soon as you get used to it, it is actually very much fun and satisfactory. I would like it to be slightly less airy, but I've already got used to it and have no complaints. In the worst case, it's going to make you feel a bit strange for the first few races, while getting to grips with it. It's not sim, but it clearly has some elements of more sim-like handling. I've played all assists off, with a gamepad, and it's good fun and extremely challenging at times. I can clearly feel that a steering wheel and pedals would much better suit this game. Even with the gamepad though, I really enjoy the challenge the handling gives me, trying not to break traction, not to lose the rear end while cornering, not over-correcting, etc. The sense of speed is brilliant. At some of the street circuits, or the fast road circuits, you really feel the rush, trying to stay on the throttle as long as you can, braking late, feeling like you're surely going way too fast! Just so you know, I'm playing with very hard AI, no assist, and manual gears, with a ps3 gamepad. There are a lot of smaller things I like about the game, things like being able to change the duration of a race, being able to command your team mate and so forth. The team mate commanding could be better, but it's a nice addition. As an example, I was in a race fighting my way through the pack since the starting order had been reversed, while my usually very slow team mate was at the front, thanks to the high starting position. I found myself third when the final lap started, with my team mate in front of me at second. I'd told him to be aggressive, and thought to myself that perhaps I should tell him to slow down a bit, seeing that he was a bit all over the place going for the first position, and we needed the points to complete the team objectives. I then thought ""nah, let's go for the 1-2"", and a few corners later he spun trying to overtake and dropped to the back of the pack. So the team orders definitely added something there, as I felt like an idiot afterwards :D Not a huge thing, but nice small detail. Multiplayer seems to be great. I was doubtful about the ""gaining xp"" and ""buying cars"" business, but I have to admit that it adds more depth to the game mode. There are loads of options, from cups, single races, and time attacks (with everyone on track at once), to something called destruction derby, which I have not yet tried as I have little interest in that sort of racing, but it shows some variety nevertheless. Being able to have your own club with friends or others is a great addition, from creating liveries to trying to finish well to gain reputation. There are quite a few maldonados out there, so sometimes patience is tested.... very much. I guess you could find a group or a league, but most my experiences have been fine, and the racing is surprisingly good, especially as the damage tends to take the crash heads out quite soon after the start. Damage is nice by the way. Nothing spectacular, but done very well still.So, like said in the beginning of this review, the game is good. To me it felt like a good deal as well, as it was £29 on release, as opposed to the usual £39-£59 most new games seem to be. I'm sure people who bought Grid2 might feel differently, given that the game is less than a year old, but myself not being one of those people, it felt like great value. It's a solid racing game, and I'm going to spend a lot of time with it I'm sure. Hope this review is helpful to someone!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not a Masterpiece, but GRID Autosport is a solid improvement over GRID 2, finally bringing the experience closer to the popular first GRID title.The same mix of sim and arcade elements combined with an aggressive AI, but with today's graphics.Although I'd have preferred a full dashboard, the out of focus one you get is IMHO still passable and effective.Handling is fun, (luckily) with a little less emphasis on drifting than GRID 2, and together with an aggressive AI you get the style of close simcade racing that the original GRID was known for. Note if you are looking for a full racing sim, you are better off buying something like AC, rFactor2, GSC or R3E, but if like the occasional lighter sim GRID Autosport is pretty much a home run.Now it may be irrational and I have to do more comparing, but there are areas (besides the dashboard, team management and elements of the GUI) where I still think the original is better, however the same is true for GRID Autosport (handling is a mixed bag, FFB setup, graphics).So basically I like GRID Autosport, solid simcade, fun and aggressive racing 7.5 - 8/10I am racing on hard, no aids with a DFGT.System i7-920, 16gb, w7-64b and 780GTX - runs a solid 60fpsOk, couple observations..Like - close hard racing when you suddenly see a car in front fly in the air and rolling passed  you.Miss - the old GRID damage cam is still better. Overall replay is clunkier, just slight improvement over GRID 2AI - on hard the AI can basically keep up even after a rwd car hast lost one of its rear tires and is driving on the rim.Small things that can make or break your gaming experience,CM made a benchmark game with the original GRID and they are having difficulties mixing ""innovation"" with proven game elements. Perhaps it is my age, but I am starting to hate the excessive push to innovate games to the detriment of success formulas. Reviewers and even players give games a poor rating because they are not innovative enough. Me, if it works, copy it and just update the graphics and physics to match the next generation of technology - I'll buy it.Don't push yourself to reinvent the wheel, give us what works what we really like to play.GRID Autosports is just that.CM took a good look at the original GRID and tweaked their GRID 2 base game until it neared the original GRID.Next time I hope CM will remember and produce a GRID 3 that is basically GRID with updated physics and graphics.Better yet get a couple of licenses, something like V8SC would really be a perfect match for this engine.A full championships beats the many ""analog"" single events with just a couple of cars and tracks each.Get the right license and you'll have the next F1 ""easy win"".Did I mention V8 Supercars - dunno how they do it, but that's probably the most exciting TC racing on the planet, with a good mix of high tech, close competitive racing, challenging tracks and oozing with sheer character.You even already have the some of the cars in GRID Autosports.Did I mention V8 Supercars?...and the Utes :)			",301,23,57,38,66,1,76

												Hoped this game would rekindle hope for the GRID series, but frankly its awful. Handling is only marginally better than the last game, awful menu system - cant even just grab a ccar from a menu and practice a track, have to go through setting up a competition, career mode is basic, AI stinks - far too aggressive in open-wheel cockpit racing - its like it is barely aware of your existance.Cockpit views are a joke, either right up to the window with no detail or a blurry non-functional cockpit from a behind the wheel position.Obvious from the start that this is going to be plagued by a lot of DLC but its a cash-cow thats not worth milking.I bought this hoping for a good GRID again and after hearing positive feedback on the internet but it was blatant BS. Buy Assetto Corsa, Next Car Game or wait for Project cars but don't waste your money on this like I did.I spent just under 2 hours on the game and cannot drag myself back to play it. Uninstalled, only saving grace was I got it at a discounted price but I still feel let down. They need to work hard to make me bother to reinstall it.LOL patch appeared as I was typing this up - went into forums to check it out, no notes yet for that patch but there is a bit of feedback about the game corrupting save files, *slow clap* well done codemasters, epic fail (a post states they fixed corruptions but are waiting for that patch to go through QA - shame they didn't QA the rest of it before release).

												This game has all the fun of a roullette wheel. The chances of gettin gthrough a whole race without being spun out by another car ramming you off the track and into a spin are slim. Even your own team mate seems to ignore your existence. If you can manage to get through the pack then it's an easy win. Nice graphics but let down by an AI that doesn't seem to take into account where you are driving. The constrained career mode format seems a shame too. Otherwise it's fun to drive. The only full price game I've played this year, but by far the most dissapointing.			",53,6,7,12,10,0,14

												While it's a pretty game to look at, the overall experience is lacking.The ABS should be an anogram for 'Always Locking Breaking System' as the breaking is terrible, even when using analogue controls.A.I. opponents are lack lustre. They will hold their driving line, even if it means smashing into your rear quarter panel, sending you off the track. Sorry, but if I have the inside line and carrying the speed into the corner (all whilst controlled), the AI should not be trying to send me into the wall because they want to keep their line. The cockpit view is horrendous and obviously only put in after the outcry from Grid 2's omition. The fact is, they could have and should have put a few more hours into it. It's a blurry mess.The Career mode is a simple set of menus and it feels like the available vehicles and tracks are limited, in comparison to previous installments. This isn't the case, however it gives that impression due to the menu's being so 'cut-off' from the player in comparison to Grid and even Grid2.There is no sense of continuation in your career either, apart from five vertical bars that increase with arbitrary numbers after each race. You don't have your own team, you don't manage your team-mate. You are simply a gun for hire for random teams. You don't even get to choose your livery, colour scheme, or even your vehicle number.In all honesty, everything in this game has been done before and done far better.Racedriver: Grid, is still the best in this series. Such a shame.			",268,32,13,28,28,5,34

												Grid autosport is truely a Next Gen title , On PC this game has just got to be seen to be believed, on triple monitors it is outstanding, performance is great too, add the free Hi Rez DLC and it Soars High above the competition, Codemasters once again Blow away all before them. I have played and own just about every racing title out there to date, but none have grabbed my attention quite like Grid autosport, yeah sure it is a tough game to master but this only adds to the fun factor, multiple choices when setting up your game allows you to adjust the game to your own play style and skill level.The balance between sim and arcade in my opinion is perfect, this game and the CM team deserve a heap of credit for a Job well done.For me 10/10 simply an awesome game.

												I'm more of a realistic racing gamer.  I am a die hard Gran Turismo fan, so realisim/simulation is very important to me.  So im not really a fan of the arcade racing games, which is what this game is. I played the first Grid and it was pretty good for when the game came out. GT6 really set the bar high, so if your looking for a racing game that makes you feel like your actually racing, Grid Autosport is not the game for you.			",21,0,2,2,0,0,0

												Better game than Grid 2, even if it's fundamentally the same engine with a different UI. The handling differences bring it back in line with the original Grid, to the point that it feels like you actually have to RACE, instead of GRID 2's constant drifting.  ",215,38,9,33,26,2,38

												I'm a die hard sim racing fan and very rarely play arcade racers.  That being said, GRID Autosports is certainly not the greatest racing game I've ever played but I will say it does a great job of bridging the gap between arcacde and simulation.  If you're looking for a down right fun racing game without wanting to get into the technical side of upgrading and tuning cars this game is what youir looking for.  On another positive note, I think this game will help to get startup racers playing more technically proper sim racing games.			",81,8,6,5,6,0,12

												Almost going back to this games roots of TOCA, this is the best track/street racing game on the circuit at the moment. With improved physics and almost sim controls (but just enough arcade) this is a must for all racing fans. The best single and online racer there is at the mo without the needs for a full on sim set-up... 9/10			",31,2,11,5,12,0,5

												IMO, it feels like someone got really lazy when they got to the ""resolution setting"" part of making a PC game... The game force streaches to my 4:3 monitor's shape when I set it to play at a 16:9 res with 16:9 screen ratio, Other games work it out just fine, this is the only game I'v ever had a issue with in that. although the game is quite pretty when at high settings.The controles for keyboard are just terrible untill you've played for a race or two (each time you play). you tap the A or D keys for half a second and your car is nearly sideways because it instantly goes full turn.So in my opinion, and in my situation of having a 4:3 monitor and no stearing wheel, it's not really worth the 50$ I would have paid if it wasn't on sale for 25$. and even for 25$ I'd kinda rather have my money back than have the game... :/Although if you do enjoy the game there is a good amount of game to play.Just my opinion. Also, I bought this hoping for something a little more like GranTurismo so it may just be that talking... or that this makes me think of NFS Pro street, which is a game I liked even less than this game.

												Overall, it's very difficult to review this game since your enjoyment of it is based heavily on your presonal gaming prefertences, and GRID AS is certainly a lot less forgiving to newcomers than its' predecessor.If you enjoy realistic racing sims like Gran Turismo, Asset Corza, etc., you will...probably enjoy this game. I wouldn't know.If your racing game preferences lean more towards the likes of Burnout, Split/Second, and the like, or if you enjoyed GRID 2 and expect more of the same, then you will likely hate this game with all your heart.

												""Oh God, not another race!"" is the phrase I use the most when playing this game. The reason being that when I bought a racing game, I was hoping I'd be racing.I really enjoyed Grid and I think I'm in a minority because I also enjoyed Grid 2. Grid Autosport I want to like but it just feels like a chore, grinding out races so you can slowly unlock other races which you need to grind out to unlock more races...Of the 5 race types, Tuner is like driving a marshmellow around a track - no sense or urgency or speed. Drift is ridiculous - you hardly even need to brake, the car will drift as soon as you turn the wheel so there's little to no skill involved. I tried fishtailed left and right through a section whilst completely ignoring bends and still won. And Timetrials? Who cares - I want to R A C E!Endurance is pontless and in a game that already feels like hard work, why bother? Instead of looking at your lap counter and thinking 'Only 2 more laps', you look at the clock and think 'Bloody hell, 5 more minutes?'Other modes are good as you actually get to race but very frustrating in that you will bust a gut to get a win or a 3rd place against superior competition (actually, it's only 1st and 2nd that are superior, but it helps you to delude yourself that everyone in the field is) and your efforts are largely pointless because your teammate is still on the starting grid trying to find the ignition.To be honest, it pains me a little to not recommend this game because the racing can be great fun. But every time I pick it up to play, after about 10 minutes I'm just begging for the end of the event and having to drag myself through. Shouldn't it be more fun?			",317,75,32,47,77,2,58

												Heard it was meh, Grid 2 was better, etc. Well that may be true, but it is still a great game.The only annoying thing is that you are dependant on AI partners during events. They are frequently♥♥♥♥♥♥which drags you down. This would be fine, but your main rivals throughout the game, Ravenwest, are both pretty much always in the top 3. Because of this it is very difficult to win since their team average will be higher than yours. To solve this I generally make one of them crash by pushing them into the wall or something. Not exactly in the spirit of the game, but neither is forcing you to have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI partner that makes it so you can't win.			",190,36,11,23,12,3,24

												Codemaster regains its composure in the grid series to produce a definite one foot forward offering. Clearly holding the F1 franchise is beginning to show dividends.The most noticable change is car handling,something far from the case in its predecessor Grid 2 and while not exactly pick up and play as Grid 1 is worth the effort to master. The single player story/campaign is hit n miss but again Grid never did hold an award for that part and car tweaking is minimalist to say the least. That aside all runs smooth,nice tracks, nice cars, much improved handling from 2 and more than reasonable AI dependant on setting.I still hanker for and lord the original as autosport comes across a little to clinical looking in presentation for my liking but this doesnt detract from it offering itself up as a really good driving gameGrid autosport with DLCs is the most complete grid package from cars,options,tracks to arcade amusement todate, its just a shame yet again to have to collect the DLCs to make it so.

												Very good racing game, a lot of race types, cars... good graphics. good driving feel. one of the best racing games that I played.I need to mention, the game is not Arcade, is more oriented to a Simulator. You will need few time to understand how to drive the car, but after that the driving feel is very good. Pay attention to difficulty settings, some driver addings need to be set On or Off based on your driving style.Also, Online content is very good. Racenet Challenges is a nice way to play vs friends/community. There are leaderboards for each type of race. Ghost Car is also nice, can virtually compete with a friend.			",13,2,5,1,2,0,0

												Great game.It is not a Sim, nor near. Not Forza, not Assetto Corsa... It is not a Sim.Pros: The driving is great if you just want to chill a lil bit. The tracks are also great. Above all, the fact that you only go through the campaign if you want to. The price is another great point, considering what the game offers.Cons: Not all camera angles are good, and in my opinion that's one of the weak points of this game. It may also be a bit to hard to win any race (just learn to appreciate ending in the top 5)Overhaul, it is not the best, but it is good, and for its price, it is a great deal! ",50,1,2,8,2,0,3

This game suggests that if You are driving with speed more than 100kph and get your back wheels outside of track You will start to roll+ AI is a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it will make You whana break your controllerThis is arcady console game and it feels like it.Thouse who say it isn't just plays with all asists on and don't know nothing about real racing simulatorsPlease if You whana stay unsane, DON'T BUT THIS!!!

												Great game.It is not a Sim, nor near. Not Forza, not Assetto Corsa... It is not a Sim.Pros: The driving is great if you just want to chill a lil bit. The tracks are also great. Above all, the fact that you only go through the campaign if you want to. The price is another great point, considering what the game offers.Cons: Not all camera angles are good, and in my opinion that's one of the weak points of this game. It may also be a bit to hard to win any race (just learn to appreciate ending in the top 5)Overhaul, it is not the best, but it is good, and for its price, it is a great deal! ",50,1,2,8,2,0,3

												This is a fantastic racing game, far better than its predceding titles. Its graphical fidelity is on par with Grid 2, and its mechanics are a vast improvement over both Grid 1 and 2. The game feels quite a bit more realistic than the other Grid games, more of a simulator than an arcade game, though it still retains a sense of fun and forgiveness of mistakes, at least at the lower difficulty levels. Though I have not used the online multiplayer system, I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a PC based racing game based on the merits of the singleplayer campaign alone.

												As a fan of simulators like iRacing, rFactor, Aseta Corsa and even Race 07 I would say that this game is arcady as f..kWhile driving You don't feel speeds and brakes fill like You are on ice all the timeAnd then ther is that rolling all the time. This game suggests that if You are driving with speed more than 100kph and get your back wheels outside of track You will start to roll+ AI is a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it will make You whana break your controllerThis is arcady console game and it feels like it.Thouse who say it isn't just plays with all asists on and don't know nothing about real racing simulatorsPlease if You whana stay unsane, DON'T BUT THIS!!!

												want to know what it feels like to drive a car on an ice rink? try this game. the AI is on rails and has no idea where the player is, driving side by side up to a corner where you've got the inside line the AI will try and take the perfect line for the corner and just smash rite into you every time and in most modes push you sideways over the inside of the corner triggering the ""over the line"" penalty for you.the drift cars are stupid they can start a rolling burnout in 3rd gear while doing 50kph and can somehow understeer in the middle of a full lock full speed slide.

												I was hoping Codies had learned from their Grid2 mistake but I just dont understand how you keep ruining an IP like GRID, when it was so good.  The handling is somewhat simple, the graphics are generally good but the interior of the cars are blurred out. GRID had interiors and even working dials.The replays are less interesting, the smoke and damage effects are poor and the sound is really dull.  The inside of a touring car sounds like its full of cotton wool.Its not terrible but is not as good as the original GRID, and it should be leaps and bounds ahead nowadays.The career is also very limiting and is simply a succession of single races.I do like the addition of practice, qualifying and reverse ordering of cars in round 2.  Also, the time penalties and ability to multiply the number of laps.  But good rules like this on a poorly driving car with no personal team is worthless.Lets hope that the next GRID is the best of all the games in the franchise.			",92,15,6,11,10,0,16

												Where would I start, hmmm ok the AI has a huge advantage and its not just the fact that they are faster than you for no apparent reason but also they seem to all be playing against you and you only. Its like one big team vs you, then you always have the cars they want you to drive and career mode is the most linear game I have ever seen in a race game before even more than the old Hot Pursuit. Not knowing that you cannot select cars I purchased DLC yeah noooooot. DLC I guess is just for my online cars collection but you cannot play online so they are basically just really pretty model textures to look at. All in all I say after 2 years of being on the market no game should be this dead online and that limited in scope to its offline play. Hey its a racing game these are usually not MMO buddyu so yeah way to make a flop. Not only that but why is Valve not doing anything to safegaurd its customers and loyal fans. I say that either these games need to be taken down or when the rating drops below mixed to negative the price has to be significantly dropped to reflect poor quality and development. If the old saying is you get what you pay for then what is valve and every other gaming company trying to tell us.			",115,8,3,13,3,1,12

												Best Codemasters game since Dirt 3.When I played Grid 2 I thought ""great cars and tracks, too bad the engine is garbage, and where are the Grid 1 cars and tracks?""  Grid Autosport put a simle on my face.  The ""Street"" discipline has a mix of the Grid 1 & 2 cars and tracks (not sure if everything's there yet) and a great physics engine.  The suspension dynamics feels right for the first time since Dirt 3.  Really, fun to drive, and that's what makes a racing game.  (Excpet for the drift events - WTF guys?  Boss's nephew write that or something?)Single player has 5 disciplines, and frankly I found most of them too boring to play.  But the stuff I like is enough to make the game worth getting, and I can just ignore the rest.  And if you love memorizing brake points, or just need a cure for insomnia, there's some solid content in here for you.Some reviewers seemed to be expecting a simulator.  From a Grid title?  Get real.  It's simcade all the way, and more power to it!  If you want to set toen-in angles or somesuch, Dirt 1 is still around, but this game focuses on getting the feel of driving at the edge of traction right, and the rest can hang for all I care. (And, yes, the heavy cars wallow around like pigs - if you don't find that fun there's that whole open wheel brake-point-memorizing thing just for you.)There are 3 or 4 driving games in here, and one or more is likely to appeal to everyone.

												If you go by the ""community"" discussions and reviews, this seems to be a very love-it or hate-it game. Personally, I am loving it. As a fan of many different forms of autosport, few games in recent memory have been able to capture my interest for long. This game, for me, hits a nice sweet spot between arcade racer and sim-light that really brings the joy of driving through. I don't need to dedicate my life to it to enjoy it, but it's also not so simple that it would become stale quickly. With five playable driving disciplines, a rewarding progression system, and online play--this is a game I would definitely recommend for the racing fan open to an experience that's more a celebration of speed and competition than a technically accurate simulation.

												I don't know why I bought this because I already have GRID 2. Its ""realistic driving controls"" sucks. It feels like a chore to race, not fun. I'm lucky to ever come in the top 3 overall in multi-race events. If you dont get the lead quick then hold it and run a perfect race, you easily place anywhere from 3rd-8th. There is zero room for even a milimeter of error. With the ""realistic"" controls, it sure as hell doesn't help with the difficulty. In fact that is the reason the game has any difficulty at all: the controls.Stick with NFS Shift 1 & 2, Grid 1 & 2, Dirt 3, or Burnout Paradise. Or whatever. Shove this up your♥♥♥♥♥for all I care.

												It's Forza on PC.Finally, the GRID sequel we have all been waiting for. The sequel that takes the simulation side of racing rather than the arcade style of GRID 2. YES! It has cockpit view. Using the Xbox 360 Controller for Windows, this game feels natural to play and the use of the D-Pad to get Radio Updates from your Engineer is genius. (Push left for Car Damage, Up for gap to driver infront, Down for Race Rival info and Right for Team-Mate info)Graphically: the game looks alright. Handling: Pretty good for a racer. If cut a corner you are limited to a low speed for a short time (Only kicks in on very big corner cuts)Gameplay: from what I've played so far it is really going back to the original GRID style (build your XP for a discipline - Touring Car, Endurance, Tuner, Open Wheel, Street - then take part in the international stage for that discipline)From what I've played so far, I would really say ""If you like Forza, or the original GRID - buy this!""

												Here is what I like about Grid Autosport: The car damage system in this game is top notch. The driving realism is there with lots of option to adjust to your likings. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous. The Free high res texture pack is a nice addon. The game runs really smooth at 60 fps and only drops frames during intense crashes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 Amazing game. First couple minutes I was struggling not to slide the car around, but shortly later i got used to it and the handling is very enjoyable. The AI tend to go supersonic at the beginning of a race (slight exageration) but catching up can mostly be easy due to their braking point being early in the beginning. They also tend to be a little...slamy and follow the racing line intensely, they are not afraid to barge into you. They even spin out or crash sometimes. Overall I love this game, love the graphics. But one thing that i dislike, your teammate always sucks...UNLESS it's not a team challenge, in that case he/she's either first or very close.			",82,15,9,20,8,0,6

Posted: June 28, 2014
												Note: It'll be greatly appreciated if you comment why the review was helpful or not helpful, so please take your time to comment on what I could've done better in the review.GRID Autosport is a game that is not meant to garner a new fanbase like GRID 2 was(might've succeded, although at the cost of disappointing many, including me), but is meant for people who enjoyed the first game: Race Driver: GRID(aka GRID).________________________________________________________________Gone are the 'Oh you're turning into a corner? Drift mode activated for ""fun""!' handling physics of GRID 2, the nonsense storyline, the annoying and useless engineer guy, and a linear career mode.On the other hand, making a welcome return is an emphasis on real-life circuits such as Spa, Jarama, Circuit of the Americas, Mont Tremblant; cockpit view; a career mode that is reminiscent of Race Driver: GRID with 5 separate disciplines(Touring, Endurance, Open Wheel, Tuned, and Street).________________________________________________________________Besides that, the gameplay has been tweaked to put a little more realism into the game. The physics, they're arcade that mimics a sim, but they're more believable than what GRID 2 and even Race Driver: GRID offered. As a result, races are no longer a drift fest or is drifting the best way to get around corners(quite the opposite), and something called understeer finally exists.Also, free practice sessions have been added to race weekends, giving players time to get used to the track and tweak their car's setups(yes, you've heard that correct, you can now setup your cars, although it's simplified compared to sims). Qualifying sessions are now available as well, finally making any grid position that isn't P10-12 possible. These two sessions are not compulsory and can be bypassed, but that's only recommended for casual racers with AI difficulty set to easy.Adding to that, race lengths are now extendable with the choice of 2, 3, and 5 times the original length. Don't like 3 lap touring car races? Why not have 6, 9, or 15 laps! It's possible now and I have to say it makes the career mode much more enjoyable.Speaking of race weekends, the race engineer is also a lot less intrusive and gives helpful advice instead of saying 'good job' every minute. Players now can also ask their engineers to get an update on the car's status, teammate or rival's track position, or the gap to the driver ahead. Another thing, the engineer is now British.________________________________________________________________Then, what are the downsides? Plusses outweigh the minuses(of course, my opinion), but there are some to note.First off, it's not a revolution, but an evolution. You won't find anything that'll catch your eyes for being so brand new. In fact, there are quite a few recycled contents. The track selection has some new additions like the beautiful Mont Tremblant or Sepang and CoTA, but other tracks are ones that were featured in either Race Driver: GRID or GRID 2(no new city circuits).It's a similar case with the car lists too. Although we see some new cars(all of them are great) like the Ford GT40, A1GP open-wheeler, Caparo T1, Classic Mini, Lancia Delta, and McLaren P1, many others are ones that previous games had as well. In-game soundtracks are also the case where you see recycled contents, with the soundtracks being remixed versions of GRID 2 soundtracks. They're better than GRID 2's, but still, remixed musics are remixed musics.Adding to the list, there's the cockpit view. Oh people are going absolutely mad over this. Yes, the game doesn't have a 3D interior modeling and uses the exterior mesh for cockpit views, making them low-res and undetailed. I personally have no issues with this and I like that Codemasters have added an alternative cockpit view that zooms in to the front windshield alongside the standard one(many games go for this, but I find them distracting because of car's interior taking up too much space on screen), but yeah, having a detailed interior with working dashboards like in other Codemasters titles would've been better.________________________________________________________________I haven't had the opportunity to drive around every track or drive all the cars in the game. However, after 2 days of playing, I'm already liking the game more than the previous two games. Had GRID 2 been like this game, I would've fallen in love with it. It took a huge disappointment and more waiting, but I'm glad that Codemasters have listened to fans' outcry and worked to fix it. GRID Autosport is not a groundbraking game, but a delightful fan service for those who waited for a sequel to Race Driver: GRID. If you were one of those people, I'd recommend that you give this game a chance. Verdict: Recommended, 4/5			",42,19,26,2,16,2,1

												This game was Codemasters' last chance to make things right. They blew it completely. Here is why: 1. Cockpit views - a bloody shame when compared to the lovely one that the original GRID came with. 2. Handling - worse than GRID 2 and incredibly bad compared to the original GRID; trying to manage oversteer with keyboard is a chore to put it lightly. 3. Car tuning - a total joke, even NFS Underground 2 was better; you might think that Codemasters could at least copy things right, but that would be smart4. Career - the whole team experience package from the original GRID is missing; no comment5. Endurance races - Codemasters managed to screw them up really hard; Le Mans is gone, as well as the day-night cycles during the race - instead you have to fight tire wear and AI that seems not really affected by that6. Blur - once you deactivate that, your eyes suddenly feel like they don't need glasses (yes, it's that bad), but you will instantly see how shoddy the textures were made; the rest of the game is similarly crafted ...Given this trainwreck, Codemasters claim that they listened to the community was a blatant lie. Unless acting upon the feedback was optional (in their opinion). You get the picture, I hope. In my not so humble opinion, this game and its developer by extension have managed to insult the first (legendary) GRID again, which to this day remains the undisputed champion. Those many awards back then were well deserved, but Codemasters as it is today does not deserve your money for this game right now. Do yourself and your wallet a favor, enjoy the first GRID (the game that does it right) and ignore the 'pretenders' that followed afterwards. Cheers.			",52,5,2,13,3,0,25

												Probably the highest on my list of games I should have never of purchased. I know it’s not a ""sim"" in the standard sense but the AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (no matter the difficultly or series). At times they're like a real-life ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you pass on the road when they’re driving too slow because when you do pass them they're right on your♥♥♥♥♥flashing their brights. WTF!? The AI for Ravenwest...wow. Sure they're great drivers but at times I'm purely out matched (again no matter the difficulty) because the way they pull away from the rest of the pack or even if I'm at max speed they'll leave every one of us in the dust. It’s like they have a twin-turbo’d supercharger with NOS. Sure that’s worth a laugh on itself but that’s the way it feels. Another thing about the game design is if you get a lil rough with the NPC cars chances are you'll crash, why I don’t know. It's like they're a tank and I'm a Ford Fiesta. I touch them, I'll either crash or my steering is F'd for all eternity (steering went orange at 20mph after the 1st turn at Bathurst). If they touch me, well I'm just F'd. What's funny is a bit ago, on Bathurst, I got side-swiped by a Rick Scott and my car damn near did a 90 degree angle into the wall on a straight away. The rubber banding I've always seen on Need for Speed games I am seeing in this game as well, it’s horrible. I'll have a 5 second lead oh wait, here comes one of the Kicker cars out of nowhere catching up, and for some reason I still got the fastest lap time. If you haven't gotten the game, don't buy it for anything more than $15 dollars cause exactly how it plays. This has game frustrated me more than being a fat kid in high school.

												The good: The feel of the racing is great, not too arcadey or too simulation, just right for a casual racer like me. And the fact that AI now make mistakes is a very good feature. For ages I've wanted a game where the player isn't the only driver doing any overtaking or causing drama, because in real life every driver can make mistakes and Grid has finally managed to show that. The drivers actually pressure you in this game, where as in some games you feel like the AI dont challenge you enough. Lets be honest, there is not a lot of good touring car games out there, and this is probably the best of the touring car games.The bad: It's WAY to predictable. In Grid 1, the ravenwest team was exactly the same, dominating every race and winning everything, and when Grid Autosport was announced, codemasters was happy to announce that ravenwest was back. The only thing i was thinking when they announced the return of ravenwest is ""Not good"". What makes racing exciting (for instance the BTCC) is competition. Anyone in the BTCC, ranging from matt neal, jason plato, andrew jordan, giovanardi, colin turking, and a lot more have the chance of winning races and being a potential champion. Grid Autosport however... has completely got that all wrong. I am soley a touring car driver, so i dont know About the other events, but in the touring discipline, you can pretty much gaurentee Nathan Mckane and his ravenwest teammate will come in 1st and 2nd, with the team kicker guys coming in 3rd and 4th. EVERY SINGLE RACE, you can pretty much predict where everyone is going to finish. The occasional switiching of positions, but thats rare to say the least. You feel like theres no point there being any other team, since ravenwest will ALWAYS... and i mean ALWAYS win the races. This bad feature alone has made me dislike this game A LOT. If the game was less predictable and ravenwest wasn't the only team capable of winning a race, this game would be much MUCH MUCH better.I also don't like the career mode. I never have in Code master games. They have improved it since Grid 1 since now i can specialise in touring cars, but theres no true progression in the game. Each season the teams are exactly the same. In games such as FIFA, each season is different as players transfer to different teams, new younger players are introduced, and old players retire. Each season is different. But with Grid Autosport (and likewise for games such as F1), the teams are always the same every season, and if you change to a different team, the other driver that was in that team just randomly disappears.. you'd think if i took one of the ravenwest guys positions, because they are ""So great"" they'd change to a different team, but no...Sidenote: I also think they should of added team creation again. I wanted to be competing in the touring cars championship with my own team, and my own selected team mate, like in Grid 1.Despite not recommending this game yet, if they fix what I think is wrong with this game, I would recommend this game to ALL. I like that code masters have gone back to touring cars and by no means hate the disciplines in the game, just the predictablity.			",8,3,14,1,8,1,4

												The review is distributed into different headings and paragraphs, and they're really short so don't worry about it. I haven't written this review in detail because there already are many great LONG reviews to read but if you like to read some short one with not-so-much explanation about stuff, read mine.TL;DR It's a good game, I'll give it a 8.5/10. Comparing with GRID 2, it's not that great IMO.In-Car ViewThis feature was added in GRID Autosport, but believe me, it sucks! They've blurred it out so that you won't see the pixelated speedometers and stuff inside which is not even working. Even the steering looks unreal. Now you must be wondering how I saw this. Here you go, download this mod: http://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/cockpit-cam-no-blur.2553/Authentic HandlingYes, indeed handling got better than any previous GRID series. You will only notice a slight difference in driving, mainly huge difference in grip (if you're comparing it with GRID 2).Street Racing Discipline CategoryJust a regular discipline having all the street cars to drive. This is one of my favourite my discipline.Tuner Discipline CategoryThis discipline will test the player's throttle management skills during the drift events. The drift cars have rear wheel drive and steering lock and short gears. Players will have to have co-ordination in steer, throttle modulation, brakes and handbrake. Timing is important as a miss will send you into a spin.Open Wheel DisciplineIn open wheel discipline, layers will have to avoid contact with other cars as even the slightest touch will mean that they have to forget of making a podium finish. The prominence of slipstream is more in this category. Players can make use of this tool to progress. Also, slipstream might be used by other drivers so players in the front must be very careful.Cars found under this category are known for their raw acceleration and agility, since they are lightweight cars. This category will have two kinds of cars – ones that are ""nippy, rear-engined"" and that which can oversteer through corners and mid-engine Formula cars that have thick tyres and lots of downforce giving players grip and confidence to attack.- Large grid sizes- The A.I. opt for clean racing lines- Cars of similar or pre-defined specification, usually single car class- Sports-tuned vehicles with lots of grip- Practice, Qualifying and Race format- Day time racesTouring Discipline The cars here will be ""grippy and lightweight"" and are designed for bumper-to-bumper racing. - Large grid sizes (up 16 cars offline, 12 players online)- Angry AI that won't be afraid to attack or protect the racing line- Cars of similar or pre-defined specification- Multiple round races- Practice and Qualifying- Day time races- Loads of trading paintStatisticsYou will be able to track all stats which includes discipline XP, number of championships won/lost, races joined, etc. You can also compare it with the community through RaceNet or your friends.RaceNet ChallengeEvery week players will have six challenges to compete and it will be based on every disciple and one wildcard. Players will be able to earn rewards like experience and money based on the final finishing position.RaceNet GroupsOnline groups can be formed allowing players to compare their progress, compete and battle for supremacy with other groups.Players will be given group experience based on their performance and are given the opportunity to design their own livery and racing.Group HQ is the right place to gain access to group's drivers and check up on various stats. It will also be hosting the group garage, that will have all the best cars of the club members, their stats and players can compare it with theirs. This area will also have group admins drop in to manage the group, promote players, change the group logo or edit the recruitment status.Game Modes- RaceNet Challenge- Online Custom Cup – It is a game mode that allows players to configure and Event the way they want it by choosing different options like discipline, vehicles class, race type, number of events, AI, tracks, upgrades, tuning and assists, manual only, cockpit cam only, pre and post-race timers, collisions, grid order, damage and flashback- Party Mode – This is a mode that is found in Custom Cup and has fun Race Types which do not fit in the five main Disciplines. It includes Demolition Derby, Checkpoint and Eliminator.Cars included in the gameThe cars in the game will be divided into five main groups – Touring, Open Wheel, Street, Tuner and Endurance. The game will be featuring Touring Cars, GT, Single-Seaters, Muscle Cars, Drift, Supercars, Hypercars, Time Attack, Destruction Derby, Prototypesand others.Touring Cars:- Honda Civic Touring Car- Ford Focus ST Touring Car- Chevrolet Cruze Touring Car- BMW 320 Touring Car- MINI Miglia- Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG (Cat B Special)- Audi RS5 (Cat B Special)- Ford Racing Ute- Holden VE Commodore Ute- Mini John Cooper Works Challenge- Peugeot 408 SCB- ADC Presteza-14- Ford Falcon FG- Holden VF Commodore- Ford Sierra RS500 Cosworth Group A- Nissan Skyline GT-R (R32) Group AOpen Wheel Cars:- Dallara F312- Ariel Atom 3.5- Caterham SP/300.R- Lola B05/52- Ariel Atom 500 V8- Dallara IndyCar- Caparo T1Street Cars:- Mini John Cooper Works GP- Ford Focus ST- Volkswagen Golf R- Honda Integria Type R DC5- BMW 1 Series M Coupe- Lancia Delta HF Integrale Evo 2- BMW M3 Coupe- Audi RS 5 Coupe- Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG- Aston Martin Vanquish- Mercedes-Benz SL65 AMG Black Series- Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione- BMW E30 Sport Evo- Alfa Romeo 4C- Pagani Huayra- SRT Viper GTS- Mazda Furai- McLaren MP4-12C- Aston Martin One-77- McLaren P1- Pagani Zonda Revolución- Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport- Koenigsegg Agera R- McLaren F1 GTTuner Cars:- Ford Mustang Boss 302- Chevrolet Camaro SS- Dodge Challenger SRT8 392- Nissan Silvia (S15) spec-R Aero- Honda S2000- Mazda RX-7 Type RZ (FD3S)- Dodge Charger R/T- Plymouth AAR Cuda- Ford Mustang Boss 302 Modified- Chevrolet Camaro SS Modified- Honda S2000 Modified- Nissan 2003 (S15) Silvia Drift Tuned- Nissan 2004 (Z34) 350 Nismo Drift Tuned- Mazda RX-7 (FD3S) Drift Tuned- Nissan 2005 (R34) nismo GT-R Z-Tune- Mazda Panspeed RX-7 (FD3S)- Honda 5zigen Civic- Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X Team Orange- Nissan 2011 (Z34) Chris Forsberg Racing 370Z- Nissan 1993 (S13) Daijiro Yoshihara 240SX- Honda NSX REndurance Cars:- Audi R8 LMS Ultra- Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG GT3- McLaren MP4-12C GT3- Aston Martin N24 V12 Zagato- Shelby Cobra Daytona Coupe- Nissan Nismo GT-R (R35) GT500- Honda HSV-010 GT- Ford GT40 Mk1- Lola B12/80- Mazda 787BTracks and LocationsThe game will be featuring 22 tracks with more than 100 routes that will include both racing circuits and fictional street circuits.Racing circuits:- Autodromo Internacional do Algarve, Portugal- Autosport Speedway, Japan- Brands Hatch, United Kingdom- Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, Belgium- Circuit del Jarama, Spain- Circuit Mont-Tremblant, Canada- Circuit of the Americas, USA- Hockenheimring, Germany- Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Indiana, USA- Istanbul Park, Turkey- Mount Panorama Bathurst, Australia- Okutama, Japan- Red Bull Ring, Austria- Sepang International Circuit, Malaysia- Yas Marina Circuit, United Arab EmiratesStreet circuits:- Barcelona, Spain- Chicago, Illinois, USA- Detroit, Michigan, USA- Dubai, United Arab Emirates- Paris, France- San Francisco, California, USA- Washington, D.C., USA			",273,38,8,17,20,0,9

												Even with the assists turned all the way off and the AI turned all the way up this game is much to arcade for my tastes. If you're looking for an arcade racer then this is the game for you, but sim racers need not bother. As a consolation this game is very pretty, and runs well on my medium to high-end desktop.

												Like most people, i was very sceptical about this game, i really didnt believe that codemasters would listen to the feedback from Grid 2 and improve on it greatly.... But i was wrong! This game is NOTHING like Grid 2, the graphics are better, the handling has been improved dramatically and the entire feel of the game is just amazing. You actually have to think about when to break before a corner, compred to Grid 2 when you could power slide any car around any corner at just about any speed.I can already tell that this game has been designed with us in mind.I totally recommend this game to any Grid fans, you wont be dissapointed.

												In terms of driving games I am quite experienced. I know what I like and I know what is good and GRID Autosport fits into both categories. The original GRID was an awe inspiring addition to (at the time) a flooded market of extremely good driving games, both simulator and arcade. Its greatest achievement was its introduction to road physics. Everybody lapped up (excuse the pun) the way you could feel the drive and know/react to the changing road surface. In GRID 2 the ball was dropped a bit. It was alright, but it did not live up to the original. In GRID Autosport 'everything is awesome!!'. Each of the driving disciplines has been perfected beautifully. Driving is fun and the simulation options are vast, yet it still has a fun arcade feel?! It expands in every department compared to the original. The framerate is damn fast even at ultra settings with the high definition pack. I have encountered zero bugs and the multiplayer is quality. I am so happy with my purchase and cannot fault it. It is certainly worth giving a go. Join in multiplayer and lets race! ",216,27,17,33,44,3,71

												Grid Autosport is a beautiful game and the free HD texture pack adds a lot to the car models. The driving itself is very different from Grid 2, so if you're expecting the slide around every corner at top speed driving then you might want to look elsewhere. Grid Autosport's driving style is very sim like and more realistic then Grid 2. I'm only a few hours in and there are a few things that I would have liked to see in this game that seems to be left out. First off if your going for a sim style game I believe it should hold true to other sim racing games and Grid Autosport lacks some of those features. You cannot purchase vehicles, the upgrading system is lacking and almost seems useless at this point because all upgrades that are available seem to be installed for you. But even with those few issues I can still confidently recommend Grid Autosport because it is a solid racing experience with great handling and outstanding graphics. When I get some more hours in I may edit my recommendation but for now this is how it stands.*Update 6/28/14After checking out the multiplayer i found out that is the mode in which you can purchase vehicles and have a garage to store them in. I still wish they had this in the career mode considering i don't play a whole lot of multiplayer.			",561,113,39,70,38,8,35

												I have sadly only played in the years I have been with the Master Race 1 of the Grid based Racing games. Grid 2. Everything About that game I loved its sense of speed the way the game felt and it wasn't just a Oh Hey i'm a Racer here on steam hoping you buy me.. It was something special that some Racing games dont have. Finally we have Grid Autosport. One of my friends shared this game in a Twitch LiveStream and the moment I saw it I wanted to play it. This Game has ALOT to do and will keep you busy for a while. There is tons of customizing of your car from normal upgrades to just including better front and back suspension on your car.. To adding a little better braking to your tires.. And thats not all.. This game offers something I felt was needed in Racing games again. AI's that while can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s at times.. Are Ones that make you have to read the road a little quicker before making your move. Timing your turns about 2 seconds before you make it or you'll bail out and be executing barrel rolls of joy. (Which Yes Peppy Hare would be very proud of you lol)This game has some of the best graphics i've seen CodeMasters do ever. They are still a company by gamers and for gamers and I'm very glad they brought this literally one of a kind title to Steam & the PC. If you have been wanting a Racing game that will really kick your butt but have you coming back for more This is literally right up your alley. So Grab that Wheel Hit that Gas and get ready for a ride you'll never forget.			",319,39,10,29,10,2,4

												The control is just limited: the ASWD which is also awkward to drive with. I know you can change the binds but just because a lot of people uses ASWD doesn't mean it's suited for cars. They could have used the mouse to control the car as it would be more accurate to play with the car.Playing the game lead me to boredom: racing in this game is dull, and you can just ""flashback"" when you crashed anyway, giving less of a challenge.Beside though I'm using the Linux port, but since I'm mainly talking about the gameplay, then that's not the problem.I still find Gran Turismo 2/3 the best car racing game.

												Not a bad spiritual successor to the original GRID nor the Race Driver games. Features a few different disciplines of racing from touring cars to open wheel and drift cars. While the graphics are clearly from last gen, the lighting is superb and the sound equally matches it. Unfortunately the immersion is completely lost though as each 'season', which consists of only a few races, doesn't really make me feel like I'm accomplishing anything nor developing a reputation with a team. Picking a team to sign on with is literally just about picking the team with the most XP and easiest sponsor goals. If it fleshed out the disciplines a little more with a greater variety and some longevity, and insentive to stick with smaller teams, I feel like it would help develop that element of competition we see so often in real racing. This would also help me commit to one discipline longer as racers don't typically jump from Formula cars to drifters and then back to hot hatch time trials, it all seems a little incoherent.On top of this, the car handling isn't the best. Cars feel very floaty and there's almost no difference in the way each car feels regardless of drive or engine placement. The interior view is also incredibly lackluster; nothing inside the car works and the textures are so incredibly low res that Codemasters has opted to blur it all out.While there are an incredible amount of faults to this game, it is still somehow fun. It has a few cool features as well, such as the 'second screen' mode, which for people with two monitors allows you to have the race standings and a TV-like broadcast of the race featured on your other monitor while you play the game on the primary monitor.It's not worth the initial price of $50, but I'd certainly check it out for $25 or less, especially if you're a fan of other Codie games and are familiar with their arcade quote 'semi-sim' style car games. 7 / 10			",271,69,31,22,45,3,23

												In a racing game in which automobiles are featured, one would expect them to handle like cars. In GRID 2, what you had were not cars, but rather some form of drift mobiles, dressed up to look like some of the world's greatest 4-wheeled racing machines. Codemasters had created the ultimate in arcade environments - sliding was faster than standard cornering. And those who wanted a true-blooded racing sim sequal to the original GRID spoke out. They were not happy.And so Codemasters made THIS game. GRID Autosport. Where cars feel like cars. Where endurance races can require endurance (depending on your option settings). Where winning a race is more than just swinging your car around corners casually whilst daydreaming about what your drifts must look like if not for terrible reply camera angles. This is what GRID 2 should have been.			",78,13,15,18,32,1,48

												In a nutshell, unrealistic ""racing"" and a lack of adjustment makes for a poor game if you're a real racer.Dear Developers of GRID (all of them)  Race07...please go and play it...Please understand that racing does not require false measures to spice it up.  It only seeks to infuriate.  Why not have % points of AI speed, like RACE07. Why not have car setup like RACE07?Why is ""Season 1"" 4 races at 2 tracks? Go play F1 2012-14...and see what a season is.It is not ""racing"" to have the AI magically speed up to keep up. Going from 16th to 1st in a lap and then have them an inch off your bumper the rest of the way isn't REALISTIC on either count.So lets be frank - this is the 2nd waste of money from the GRID series.  Promises made and broken.Assetto Corsa is now my hope that there is going to be a game capable of replacing RACE07.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After a little while trying this racing game out i would have to say it leaves alot to be desired. Car handling is not very good, graphics are ok but not eye watering or atleast better than the last game in the slightest, opponent AI seem to just want to take you out or be moving pylons rather then win a race, career mode feels like a hard slog rather than an enjoyable experience. I have to say i prefer  grid 2 rather than this. Game feels like a rush job to cash in on the grid name rather than a game to further a franchise. I hope further playing sparks some kind of interest as at the moment im thinking money wasted..			",11,2,1,4,4,0,0

												I want to first start out by saying I have loved a lot of Codemasters racing games. I liked Dirt3 despite it having little to do with actual rally racing. I liked Grid 1 and was unimpressed however by grid 2. The F1 games I adore. Now to Autosport. First the game looks pretty good and has a good balance between realistic and arcade handling. For instance in a Rear wheel drive car, if you apply to much power on a corner exit you are gonna find the back end wanting to overtake the front. Yet it so very easily controlable allowing more relaxed play.The it seems would then play very well, and it does, untill the game adds any number of A.I. cars.The AI in this game is utterly atrocious! When I was following and watching an AI for a number of laps I always noticed he broke at the 150 meter board and I could manage to brake at the 100 meter board. So when I go for the overtake in late braking he suddenly brakes at the 200 meter board and of course me being in his slipstream i crashed right in the back of him. The worse has to be though when the AI is following you. They make the same misjudged break distance but instead the other way. For going into a hairpin after a long straight I would often be barreled into by an AI who would hit the brakes at the 50 meter board and of course run me off the road. Once I return I'd be saddle'd with a pennalty thus ending any kind of a counter attack. All in all a good game simply ruined by AI. If they can fix that, this negative review will be a great one. As there are so many basics the game just had done well. Good tracks, good cars, very cool team systems. and four different disciplines of racing to enjoy... Assuming it was just you on the track.

												Not a bad spiritual successor to the original GRID nor the Race Driver games. Features a few different disciplines of racing from touring cars to open wheel and drift cars. While the graphics are clearly from last gen, the lighting is superb and the sound equally matches it. Unfortunately the immersion is completely lost though as each 'season', which consists of only a few races, doesn't really make me feel like I'm accomplishing anything nor developing a reputation with a team. Picking a team to sign on with is literally just about picking the team with the most XP and easiest sponsor goals. If it fleshed out the disciplines a little more with a greater variety and some longevity, and insentive to stick with smaller teams, I feel like it would help develop that element of competition we see so often in real racing. This would also help me commit to one discipline longer as racers don't typically jump from Formula cars to drifters and then back to hot hatch time trials, it all seems a little incoherent.On top of this, the car handling isn't the best. Cars feel very floaty and there's almost no difference in the way each car feels regardless of drive or engine placement. The interior view is also incredibly lackluster; nothing inside the car works and the textures are so incredibly low res that Codemasters has opted to blur it all out.While there are an incredible amount of faults to this game, it is still somehow fun. It has a few cool features as well, such as the 'second screen' mode, which for people with two monitors allows you to have the race standings and a TV-like broadcast of the race featured on your other monitor while you play the game on the primary monitor.It's not worth the initial price of $50, but I'd certainly check it out for $25 or less, especially if you're a fan of other Codie games and are familiar with their arcade quote 'semi-sim' style car games. 7 / 10			",271,69,31,22,45,3,23

												Having played Dirt 2/3, Grid 2, F1 2013 and now Grid Autosport, im pleased with how GA (Grid Autosport) has turned out.For me I have found that the game runs noticeably better than Grid 2 and the optimisation / performance is considerably better. Ive not noticed any stuttering or any freezing which was common with Grid 2 (due to how the replay system saved data to the hard drive)The game is a lot less arcady than Grid 2 and you do have to slow down and take corners properly compared to Grid 2 where I could slam the bughatti veyron into corners at top speed heheheheDefinately recommended if you enjoy racing / dirt series (ie half way between a simulation and an arcade racer)			",104,9,13,5,10,2,4

												Congratulations Codemasters and thank you too all the skilled people at your Team for creating a fun, realistic racing game.From the initial introduction and into the first push of the accelerator its a thrill.  Graphics are not hard on my machine and with the G27 Game wheel its a joy to entertain myself with.  Unlike so many otherracing types games all the cars look familiar, the teams recognised and the tracks brilliant to drive.  Grip and car roll/movement is just like my 12 year old Mitsi so its not like driving a jet around the screen or some 2 tonne monster over ice.  The music is toe tapping between races - the voices very seductive and the allure to loose hours at the tracks should not be understated.I am only season one into the game so fingers crossed it continues to get Tiimii's 2 Thumbs Up !!I look forward to the oncoming DLC'si7 3.4g 16ram SSD 780Evga Gtx 47%GPU load running 60f/s 30%CPU load on 2 cores			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In the pastmost of my racing games have been along the lines of Split Second; BLUR; or even recent NFS games. It has been ages since I have played a racing game that does involve the use of weapons in some way.I struggle with this game a bit as it is a brand new cocnept for me and I cant just blow things up until Im in first place, however I find GRID Autosport to be a very good choice. Not only are there a variation in the kind of competitions youll be in and the cars youll drive, but also the tracks all handle differently and you need to learn to adapt. It is quite a skill to not only go fast, but also to handle your corners correctly.Im so glad that Autoport still has the raceline option as well as the flashback. For begginers like me, these help you find the best way around the track as well as avoid crashes.			",149,17,3,22,4,1,20

												This game delivers the game GRID 2 tried to be, the handling models are much better and feel more sim racing than arcade racing (with assists off naturally), the graphics have had a major overhaul (using HD texture DLC) and look much more detailed although trackside civilians still look rubbish, nice to see the trackside grass looking a hell of a lot better too. Codemasters has delivered on the promise as far as I'm concerned, this really is a proper sequel to be proud of, although already there is 5 DLCs announced but at least this time we can get a season pass for them, so I guess that'd better long term.

												Sorry to say but after playing the Forza games on console you realise how terribly mediocre this game is.Deathly dull career mode, badly ill-conceived multiplayer system which requires you to laboriously level up each car before you can upgrade it to become competitive with other players.  Unintuitive menu and lobby systems.You can buy your own cars, but each time you buy one, you have to level it up which is tedious and time consuming, and even then, there is NO guarantee you will ever actually get to race it.  Because there are so many different categories of car, WITHIN say the street class.  So you go to a street class race, but you still cannot use YOUR street class car because it's not in the correct sub category which you CANNOT choose, you just get what you're given.  It's a dreadfully designed system. The track minimap doesn't show you anywhere near enough of the track, it is too zoomed in and cannot be changed.  Also the edges are faded which makes it even worse.  You get like half a second advance warning of where the next corner is.  It is almost useless.  By the time you can see the corner on the minimap you can see it in front of you on the road anyway.  Why not copy how other games do it, like Gran Turismo or Forza? Or NFS Shift, where the minimap automatically zooms outwards as you go faster?Overall a very lacklustre and unrewarding game.			",134,23,26,12,10,3,11

												There i was. First place about to finish the race then I messed up and drove into gravel. I thought to not worry but, when I hit backspace nothing happend. I look to the bottom right corner then I see i have no flashbacks. I quickly start racing I see it happen. 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th. and then it happends.........16th. I continue but there is no helping it I see 1 by 1 other racers crossing the finish. I finish last and as I look at the leaderboard and I see that I came last. And because of me my team finished last and I look at my team mate and I see the dissapointment in his eyes. Then he says ""You Failed Me Trace.""

												Got this game over grid 2 thinking it would have more in the game but it didn't. It feels very watered down and half a s sed.The cockpit view is just a blurred camera inside the car. The gameplay feels like it should be on mobile. The game itself is very boring. The car selection is very poor and narrow. Like JDM cars? Sucks to be you cuz theres llike 5.Like muscle cars? Nope. There's about 3. Supercars and racecars are what main in this game. But even then theres about 10 racecars. So save the money or buy grid 2. Don't waste it on this crap.			",70,4,11,9,4,0,3

So you have to drive like a man posessed by the devil and not touch any other cars. SORT THE AI OUT SO IT IS FAIR.			",6,0,2,1,0,0,0

												As in with GRID 2 the SP experience in this game is lacking, its even more lacking then in GRID 2, but MP with your mates as in GRID 2 can be fun, its a question of what you´re expecting from a game really, same as with GRID 2 its not s SIM but not an arcade neither, although they have gone closer to SIM with this one. So my rating.... well SP gets a low score of 3 out of 10 tops, but MP gets a 8 out of 10, but im guessing that has alot to do with who you are racing against. Find equal minded players and game with them and you wont be dissapointed.			",57,4,18,4,18,1,6

It's because it's a huge improvement from GRID 2, better cars, more track racing which I truly enjoy and though there is no team building experience unlike the first GRID game, the offline mode is fun enough with the different race series. Downsides are that tyre degredation only happens on endurence racing and also the AI on very hard is just aggresive no personality. Lastly the cars on street and tuner need to have more modification options.Graphics wise this game looks good and overall i'd give it a 7.9/10, fun game not a sim nor is it an arcade just in the middle of the both.

												Great game overall, except for that in singleplayer, you already have everything unlocked (excluding dlcs) for free play. Though the overall game is amazing. Multiplayer is glitchy, as I have encountered glitches like me going from last to first than first to last while I am actually in last (I have a good internet connection) and then when it looks like I am in first and I finish, it says I got last. Also, the insides of the cars are terribly textured and modeled. They are hardly detailed. No speedo, and squarish modeling inside. Also they are blurred out if you turn shaders on. Also, GRID needs rain. I'm tired of there being just sun and clouds. I want rain! Just model the rain like the rain from the F1 games, and make the windshield wipers work!			",64,2,30,1,23,0,2

Lastly the cars on street and tuner need to have more modification options.Graphics wise this game looks good and overall i'd give it a 7.9/10, fun game not a sim nor is it an arcade just in the middle of the both.

												Very precise racer, a joy to play with multiple race types. Has that tight race feel, where every turn means something and you need to make sure you are on the ideal path.Pure racer, none of that cop vs fellon crap.The benchmark option is also very usefull as it can be run in a loop to test overall system stability.

												As a succesor to Grid 2 it falls short in a lot of aspects. Online has way to much ""classes"" some of wich just have 1 car in them. This makes starting out a tedious process as you have to loan a car and often the damage exceeds the winning money. Also one just cannot make a ""favorite"" car with all these classes as every race is set in a diffrent class ie class.			",66,13,2,6,7,0,4

They still didn't get it that we don't want gymkhana crap. Even open wheel races drift nearly in every corner, when you have a car in front of you it seems like a boat that doesn't know where it is going then drifting in each corner... And then the sounds... hey codemasters try Raceroom (it's free to try) and see what sound are meant to be, and while you there look how cars handle. They becoming as horrible as EA crappy games.

												Steam friends and other people said this game is amazing, so i bought it on the steam sales, i have never ever been so dissapointed in a game. The handling is so terrible, if u put on all the settings for the settings to help you perform better, u get a lot less EXP, and even with the settings on, the handling sucks, if u turn left by accident, for example, u are totally f.k(ed) , im actually very good in other racing games, im not new to it at all, but this game pisses me off, even on ""EASY"" the Al is too good for me, lmao, i am 4 seconds behind the Al automatically, and i ride 100% perfect, all the same cars, doesnt bump anything, and as soon as i SCRATCH the side of the road, im like 7-9 seconds behind them.... Maybe im just a bad driver, but you can get a way better game for this price.. 4/10 i give this game.. it has nice idea but too many bad s.hit in the game, The best thing of the game is that it has 5 Trading Card drops though, happy about that.4/10 because of the trading cards, without the cards maybe -2/10 if i felt generous.Basically the pictures you see of GRID Autosport is like this: 💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪BUT in reality it is: \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \ \ \ \			",95,14,8,10,3,2,4

												Would be great, BUT... [UPDATED 7/1/2014: SEE BELOW]I'm new to the GRID franchise, however I have heard excellent things about it and decided to jump in here with Autosport. When I first launched the game, wow. I've been a Forza diehard for the past 4 years and this is certainly a change. If you just want to read why I don't recommend, skip to the bottom. Before I go too in depth, here's a list of the pros and cons:Pros- Engaging career mode- Beautiful graphics- Decent physicsCons- 1 BUGI'll begin with the pros. The career is broken into different classes, Tuner, Touring, Endurance, and others. In each class, there are seasons that help you progress along your career as a racer. You'll sign on with different teams, such as Oakley Racing, for the season, you'll get a teammate, rivals, etc. Normal race car driver stuff. Each event (usually, unless it's a special event) has practice (for tuning, if available), qualifying, and one to two races. I found this to be much more fun than the career of Forza, where the races were short, limited, and very boring. I have yet to try online but we'll get to why in a minute.The graphics are gorgeous. At full tilt, it looks pretty real. Just be careful about your computer's proccessing power. It'll give it a run for its money.Physics are ok. I have yet to get into the higher classes to see if grip really becomes a factor. Something does feel slightly off...BUG REPORT BELOW [FIXED - SEE UPDATE]""OK, so why didn't you try online?""Great question! There's a bug... And if it wasn't for this bug, I would highly recommend this game. There is a bug that causes a screen ""freeze"" where the car and audio freeze for about half a second at random on all graphics levels. ""Why's that such a huge deal?"" Glad you asked. Every second counts in a race. So, if you're going through a technical, winding, difficult turn and suddenly everything just glitches out, you're focus is broken. This bug will work itself out, but it starts the race again before the screen can catch up. So you'll hear the car move (and incidently go off the track or hit other cars) before you can see it. ""So what does that have to do with online racing?"" This glitch freezes your car. In a tight race, where it's bumper to bumper, turn for turn, close quarter racing, a sudden stop ruins it for everyone. I may not feel the effects besides the glitch, but I'll inadvertently make everyone else despise me.To sum it all up, great game that needs MAJOR bug fixing. The core of the game is great, however that one bug disastorously effects the gameplay, making it almost unplayable. If I was a potential buyer, I would wait until there has been a patch and one that has been reviewed as a proper fix.Computer Specs: Toshiba Satellite P50, Windows 8.1 64-bit, intel i7-47000MQ @2.4GHz, 16GB (8+8) RAM plus 2GB NVidia GeForce GTM 740M: driver version 340.43 (beta)[UPDATE] I tried uninstalling and then reinstalling the game and now it works fine. It must've been a glitch that occured during ""pre-loading"" when I preordered the game. Now I fully recommend the game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first I was quite disappointed that the vehicle interior view was not detailed like we have in Assetto Corsa and Project Cars even though I realise that this is sold as a game rather than a simulator.I regretted my pre-purchase as it seems like a lot of money but thought I'd give it a little time before throwing it away just in case I was missing the point.I've got all of the simulation titles and racing games on my PC, PS3 and XBox360 and now I have to say that this is the most fun and addictive of the lot.I'm giving it a 10/10 as it is just so immersive and so much fun racing against great AI with beutiful tracks and scenery and a great feel for those using a wheel.11 hours in two days is a huge amount of time for me to spend on a game but I just couldn't turn it off regardless of the consequences :-)I'm driving with a Fanatec CSR Elite Wheel and Pedals so I can't comment on game play with a controller but with my wheel, this is the best.Love it, love it, love it.One of my best purchases ever.

												If you like pure arcade racers this is perhaps one to avoid. I don't mind an element of sim-like controls and can just about cope with the physics - but it's more a learning experience than pure unbridled pleasure. But the graphics are great, the multiplayer hangs together very well and there's a real feeling of accomplishment if you manage to podium. There's also an awful lot to do with 5 main disciplines and several levels of racing within each. 7/10			",49,4,7,5,12,1,6

The core of the game is great, however that one bug disastorously effects the gameplay, making it almost unplayable. If I was a potential buyer, I would wait until there has been a patch and one that has been reviewed as a proper fix.Computer Specs: Toshiba Satellite P50, Windows 8.1 64-bit, intel i7-47000MQ @2.4GHz, 16GB (8+8) RAM plus 2GB NVidia GeForce GTM 740M: driver version 340.43 (beta)[UPDATE] I tried uninstalling and then reinstalling the game and now it works fine. It must've been a glitch that occured during ""pre-loading"" when I preordered the game. Now I fully recommend the game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Much improvement over Grid 2, that was just too arcady and didn't really draw me in. Happy that they finally managed to get the button layout corrected for my Fanatec CSR wheel, something they keep failing to do in the F1 games. This cannot compete in the sim racing genre as it is still too arcade like, but it is fun for quick blast. The graphics are starting to look very dated now though and you can see they made the right choice not to release on next gen consoles.			",307,63,32,26,53,4,32

												I'm not exactly what you would call a racing game fan. Don't get me wrong I've played my fair share of racers back in the day (oh wow that sentence made me feel oooooold). NFS (3-till Most Wanted), Burnout and even Codemasters very own TOCA and Colin Mcrae series. Despite this the only racing games that got my attention for more than a week or two were NFS: Porsche Unleashed and Project Gotham Racing 3 (god-tier games). Well you can safely add GRID: Autosport to that list. Even though I've just started the game I can already tell that I will love the hell out of it. As is with all Codemasters racers, G:A has a handling model that struts the line between simulation and arcade styles. It has great A.I. that, you know, actually races instead of just acting as barely animate objects for you to pass. Heck this is the first time I've felt an actual desire to beat a particular team of rival racers (damn you Ravenwest, you smug a-holes!). Oh and the menu is sliiiiiick. Can't really tell how online is gonna pan out but I can already tell I will get my money's worth just from the career mode alone. In conclusion: I would recommend GRID: Autosport to anyone looking for a straight forward, no nonsense racer.			",98,2,2,3,2,0,3

												I played a lot of Dirt 3 on xbox. I've played even more on PC after buying a wheel set. This game very much reminds me of the road equivalent to the Dirt series. It's not *so* realistic on it's easier settings that I struggle to play it, so dialing down the settings toward a harder difficulty makes it feel like I'm working and actually accomplishing something.The game has a ""team"" dynamic to it, where every season (collection of races) you choose a sponsor and race with team mates. The objectives are great because there are a bunch of them each race, and some for the season.In most racing games I'm left restarting a race to beat it every single time I barely come in second or crash in the first corner. Grid makes me feel like I'm ""accomplishing"" something even if I place 6th in a race or 4th overall, like it's part of my career.It's not a replacement for Forza or GT in the sense that you don't acquire a garage full of cars that you individually tune and buy parts for. Each race you have a practice period on the track if you choose to use it, as well as a qualifying portion if you choose. Or you can just jump straight into the race.So far I am really enjoying the game, probably because the physics remind me so much of Dirt. One con for sure is that the driving lines are absolutely terrible. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone for full price - maybe because I've purchased WAY worse games for $60, let alone $50. Overall I'm satisfied.			",97,10,5,15,14,1,13

												Back to the roots of the first GRID, if you liked that one, u ar going to like this one.The races are awesome, but im sad to say that the drifting is nothing like real life drifting, and that is a downside to this game.The leveling of the cars is a great idea, custom livery's and so on.If u want the real deal wait for assetto corsa, but if you like a good arcade racer, this is a great one imo!

												I love racing games, especially when you get to customize your car. Grid Autosport doesn't allow you to do that. It's mostly just a track racing game, and for me, that get's extremely repetitive. You're forced to race 12-15 times in an event where you drive the same car, and the same track TWICE before moving onto the next race. I sunk 4-5 hours into it so far and find Touring absolutely boring.			",171,33,10,16,14,3,26

												First impressions: This is the game we should have gotten instead of GRiD 2.  Includes the fun, eye candy, and variety we expect from ""Codies"" but is much less an arcade racer.  Instead of magic-skidding around corners a la GRiD 2, you'll have to pay attention to tire wear.  Overall, this is game more interesting and difficult version of the original GRiD.  They borrowed some elements from their F1 games as well; Practice, qualifying, and tuning are things you can skip, but doing them well will help you in the race.I have only played GRiD Autosport for a little bit, but I am already very impressed.  Little things like the high detail texture add-on DLC (free), lots of control of graphics options, and even the choice of seeing (or removing) the in-game wheel shows me how much they are listening to the fans on this one.  Also, the difficulty is highly customizable with rewards for turning off assists.  Finally, for GRiD 1 fans, I have not yet observed homicidal AI [Edit: It was hiding] nor any ""rubber-banding.""

												great game, racingt feels more realistic than grid 2 did. i do agree with previous reviewers, the interior cam while being brought back into Grid autosport, the interior detail is rather bland, blurry, no visible gauges, an FOV adjustment (or in other words, being able to move the drivers seat further back, or closer) would of been a nice feature, being as the seat is really close to the wheel in some cars, would be more of a personal preference than anything, but still, would of been nice. hopfully they maybe do a DLC that adds working, visible gauges.. we can only hope. other than that, the game plays great, i have 2 monitors, i tried using the ""double monitor"" feature, only to be annoyed by what is displayed on my other monitor, position info, and a small screen that shows me driving, as if on TV. i found this to be rather distracting, so i disabled it. plus i noticed a drop in frame rate when this was enabled. game runs great, smooth, i think its better than Grid 2 by far, so far. just having an interior few gives Grid autosport more points than grid 2, in not just gameplay, but realism, etc.. just beats it in everything. i have yet to race online, but im sure ill dig it as well.

												Grid Autosport is Codemaster's latest attempt to bring the Grid series back to its roots and right the wrongs done by Grid 2. In my opinion, Grid Autosport has left the past two iterations of the series in the dust and has instead, pointed the series in a bold new direction. The game feels more mature, with a slick menu system, a host of official real world tracks and above all, a heavy focus on the competitive world of motorsports. Even more enjoyable is the re-tuned driving system and the sim-cade like handing of the many cars in the game. Autosport finally ditches the drift style turning of the first two games. Cars stick to the tarmac and grip is easy to find. This is especially evident in the open-wheeled dicipline, my favorite in the game. The cockpit view returns to Grid, and although it may lack detail, it is a welcome edition to the game. Content-wise, there is a lot of racing to be done. Most races can be completed in less than five minutes, with the exception of endurance races which test your patience and your ability to maintain a quickly wearing set of tires. All five of the diciplines feel unique and even more impressive is the fact that the AI behaves differently in each. Qualifying is back in the game, along with a practce mode for tracks that you may not be familiar with. Expect to take part in drift events and time attacks as well. Do not hesitate to pick this one up. It is a great find in a genre that is heavily ignored on Steam. Codemaster's clearly made this game for the fans who felt that Grid 2 didn't stand up to the legacy of quality the developer is known for. Grid Autosport is the Forza or Gran Turismo of the PC, I like it that much.			",74,10,5,11,5,1,11

												If you enjoyed GRiD 1 then Autosport is probably what GRID 2 should have been (mind I actually enjoyed GRID 2 alot!), Autosport is a real simcade, i'd say about 65-35. You have to follow your line, you can't be drifting around because you will just get left behind, precision driving is the key now to get good results. With 20+ locations and 80+ cars, and of course the beautiful Codemaster's EGO engine, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the preorder price was completely worth it.

												The Medium difficulty is a little too easy, and the hard difficulty is a bit too hard. Otherwise I've enjoyed this a bunch so far. Turning off the UI and racing in interior view is pretty cool, having to depend on using the pit crew to tell you positions, damage and sush else.Also, your teammates will suck. Until you get to the higher up teams (i am assuming), your teammates will only drag your team score down. Afaik so far, you don't create your own team. For people hoping to customize liverys and such, you might to be out of luck			",148,50,26,10,14,2,5

												I enjoy this game. It has a wide variety of cars, a ton of tracks, many different race/event types, and they actually made the drifting playable (IMO), and it just keeps me wanting to play through the Career mode, it's fun. GRID 2 was ""eeh"" in my opinion, I definetely believe that Autosport is by far the better game. If you did enjoy GRID 2, they added a ""Street Racing"" event type for you to play with.However, there are still cons:The AI is improved from GRID 2, but it's still garbage in my opinion.The cockpit view is honestly the worst I've ever seen in a racing game.The graphics aren't as detailed as most games from 2014, but graphics doesn't matter to me.I can see how people think this game is repetitive, but I like that aspect to the game.9/10			",166,17,17,8,13,1,3

												Brings back memories from Race Driver GRID. The handling is just amazing and the A.I is also very good (sometimes not easy to catch them). It's much better than GRID 2. Now you have to do something if you want to win the race.The only problem is the interior view, but you will get used to the other camera views. I'm recommending this game to everyone who likes racing games.			",140,17,23,17,10,1,6

GRID Autosport, another racing game by CodeMasters, is aesthetically pleasing, and feels genuine. GAMEPLAY:Like I've said, this game is very difficult; partners, they're more than useless, so be prepared to carry your 'mate, as I know I had to. The physics in this game are nice, you have to slow down/stop at the right point (something that can't really be said about the NfS series). Drifting is not non-existant, however, it's just not used much, due to the maps. Some of the vehicles (mainly trucks) are a real pain to play with, as the bars get in your way, due to this, you can't see much.STORY:You, the driver, are paired with a sponsor; sponsors work like you'd think. Each sponsor gives different benefits, you pick the one that you think would benefit you the most. Once you've picked your main sponsor, you're thrown into the amazing world of GRID. Race until you've gotten to 'Level 5' of your sponsor, do this until you've done so with the other sponsors (Level 3 is needed for the GRID Prix). If you do too well, the co-host will tell you to turn it up, assuming you're playing on a lower level.GRAPHICS:Let's get this clear; the game is not the best in terms of graphics (like Project Cars), but it is aesthetically pleasing to the eye. The graphics are by no means bad, hell, they've implemented 4k support (thanks CM). OVERALL:A racing game for enthusiasts, or for fans of racing games. Winning feels like more like a reward, rather than just text on a screen. Gives a challenge, and the difficulty settings allow for even more of a challenge. There ARE few cons (that I can see), such as white line penalties, small selection of music, optimization could have been better, the prices ($40 for this, I can't say it's worth that much), so forth.9/10This game is FUN, however: the vehicles are clunky, making it hard to maneuver, the DLC shouldn't be here (...no), lack of weather effects (snow, rain, lightning, the like), etc. It DOES get the racing part mostly right, it doesn't jeer off, and it does feel genuine.

												The only problems I really have with the game are 1. The AI seem to be on rails; they will crash into you if they want that piece of tarmac you're on, and 2. The damage doesn't seem to be as severe as you would expect following certain impacts i.e being T-boned at 100+ mph you'd expect the car to be much more than dented with no broken windows and still fully driveable. Otherwise it's a great game, the racing is exciting for sure and the car handling has been done insanely well!			",67,15,5,7,29,0,10

												Good fun with your friends! The game has solo, multiplayer and splitscreen options. Invite some friends and you can have a blast together. It has good graphics (effects) and with the High Res mod (free) it looks good.Runs smooth, good optimisation and fairly easy to play even without assists.Some cars are interestng some not so much but there is a good selection so everyone will find a suitable one. Would be nice if you could mix up classes based on same performance (you can only play one class at a time) . Or even better put up a series of events with different classes like the old toca games. Anyway the wheel support is there but dont expect pCars or Assetto Corsa like FFB and generally the game lacks feedback on the wheel. With gamepad its fine, it seems the game is optimised more towards the gamepads anyway. But that is okay since you jump in and have a quick arcade race. Do a long endurance race or do few laps but you will have fun time within the game ,regardless. I also suggest to get the season pass since it includes some more variety and brings back the old Touring cars! The multiplayer seems pretty dead by now. But if bunch of friends get the game its fine to put in some AI drivers (on hard and very hard they are agressive but still playable) to complete the racing grid. This also gives the game some bit of challange since the AI on very hard drives very quick and it is challenging to overtake them. If you like arcade racers with bits of realism go grab it ,you wont regret it!			",230,23,13,23,14,2,27

												Its not a bad game. But is not what you are looking for probably. This isn't your arcade racing game where you can buy cars and race. If you were looking for something like gran turismo, or need for speed without being open world and requiring actual skill, DONT BUY THIS. This isn't the usual racing game where you buy a car, you race with said car, get money, get a better car and rinse repeat. In this game you have teams where you get a bot (A.K.A ""teammate"") assigned to you and you have to compete as a team. A bot that is going to ruin your fun because he sucks and knocks you ot of the race or things like that.As said, this isn't a bad game neccesairly, but its THE grid experince, NOT a racing experience.Sidenotes:-bots have an insane grip on the asphalt, you can't make them spin out, they will only spin out when they want to spin out-multiplayer is basically dead-multiplayer is severly unfair when there are only a few hundred players online because your cars gain xp and you unlock upgrades and tuning options for your car via that. Bear in mind, every car has its own xp bar, each starting from zero-there are a ton of cars ingame, but there are disciplines and categories, you can't use every car everywhere. 1 car is only usable in 1 category in 1 discipline. So that means its really easy to find a match where you can't use the car you just bought.-in singleplayer you dont have a garage. your team gives you the cars you have to race with and the tuning options and upgrades depend on said team.As stated, its not a bad game, its just probably not what you're looking for, unless you are looking for grid autosport specifically. Dont be surprised when this game disappoints you because you didn't expect this. Just like me, i asked on the forums if this is what im looking for, nobody gave an answer that had anything to do with my question.			",187,43,7,10,14,6,19

Posted: June 27, 2014
												This is a game which appeals to those who are fans of racing and motorsport. Codemasters seem to have nailed the sweet spot this time - perhaps more so than GRID 2. Let's begin with the driving. When most games try to do ""simulation"", this usually translates into unnecessarily dull driving with plenty of understeer, no sense of speed, the inability to drift and the inability to turn while braking. In Autosport, you still get the excitement and sharp handling of GRID 2 but with a lot more control. You can really tell a car's limits jsut from the vibration and tyre noise. I'd describe it as a perfect balance - it's deep but still fun and intuitive. For someone that plays a lot of racing games, I usually find that in some games, you are disadvantaged by not using assists, whereas in this game, turning of all assists and using manual gears is actually rewarding rather than punishing. Whilst GRID 2 was more like a Project Gotham Racing clone, Autosport is more like a Racedriver game. Whilst there is a strong emphasis on teams, the core gameplay experience doesn't feel diluted or pushed aside by unnecessary stats, menus and artificial babble. The main selling point of this game is CHOICE. You can do all the cool street racing and drifts in exotic tuners and supercars, or you can go for a more hardcore time attack approach around tracks or do some endurance racing in touring cars and such. There are five distinct disciplines which cater for a wide audience; and is something I've personally wanted to see as a racing game fan. No longer do I have to go to a separate game for each kind of experience - you can get all the racing you want in one complete package. It's just very much pick-up-and-play. Weekly challenges return in online mode, where you have a target to beat in each of the disciplines. Want to just set a fast lap time with Bronze Silver Gold Platinum to aim for? You can. Want to get an awesome drift going? you can. From street racing to track racing to demolition derby, this game has it all. It is a very high quality game in every sense, from optimisation, game engine and lack of glitches to robust mechanics and controls. The game is highly accessible to those who have little experience in racing games with a plethora of assists and difficulty options, but also gives more seasoned veterans the chance to earn more XP by using fewer assists, higher AI difficulty, less flashbacks etc. There's not much clutter here. You can tune your car, but in a similar manner to DiRT 2 and 3. Just a 5-point slider with short explanations. The only complaint I have is that of interior view. Not only is it the worst I've ever seen in terms of the camera angle, but there is ZERO detail (see screenshots), it's just black. This is dssappointing as this was my major issue with GRID 2. If you can overlook this minor flaw, you will find high quality racing game which is more about what happens on the track than the menus.			",90,1,7,1,2,0,6

												I really wanted to like this game, but it doesn't run well on my computer. I'm running Windows 10, 32GB of RAM, a Xeon E3 1241v3, a solid state drive, and SLI GTX 970's. I haven't been able to figure out what the problem is, but it stutters about once every second, progressively getting worse and worse until it's just unplayable. The same thing happens if I disable SLI and run a single GPU.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												No words can describe how completely and utterly shi*t this game is in every possible way imagineable and possibly conceivable to mankind since the dawn of time and before that, whatever that was. < Whatever that was, it was probably epic in comparison because it didnt exist! If this was to be rated in the biggest pile of dung category, it would be comparable as being s*at out by a creature bigger than our known universe. May sound impossible, but it just was.Seriously pi**ed that I paid even the discounted £6 for this pile of.......grrrr!Addition due to comments received:Words in anger my friends. Words in anger, but I stand solidly behind that initial review!!!!Terrible AI! (They are on a pre-determined path which makes overtaking on the inside line impossible if near a corner and you CANNOT spin or damage them but they seriously f**ck you up on any contact unless you are too soft to have all the assists off)Terrible attempt at arcade handling (Vehicles handle like milk floats, then a corner comes up and they turn into boats sailing along invisible water)Skitzy code (AI 'wobble' or skip a few frames at time, disappearing then reappearing a few feet ahead where they should be and not my hardware related, believe me)No calibration support for steering wheels leaving a floating zone of about half a foot between steering left and right before the vehicle reacts.Blurry first person view.....was a warning sign of shoddy programming!I dont give a sh*t if people buy this game, I am not swaying anyone away from it, but for the first time I saw the pics and vids of this and bought it without reading the reviews and BAM, lesson learned. Most are negative as well from reading before posting mine! Seriously, TOCA on the Playstation all those years ago was incredible compared to this.....and this is just a rushed game to make a few pennies. Horrendous!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is truly astonishing. The graphics are beautiful, the cars a very, very well detailed. I love every bit of it. People say the game is bad because of the car's handling, but once you get the hang of it, you can use it to your advantage. And the even better thing is, the game really never gets boring. Crashes that may not have happened if you pressed that quit button, amazing overtakes and stunning maneuvers around turns also add onto this game's astonishing superiority.But CodeMasters, really, make us racers proud with a better penalty system.

												After 15 hours of play, I freaking hate it now. I got maybe like 3 reasons why I hate it:1. AI is too rubberband-ish, everytime I light tap them to the side, I get rubberbanded against the grass or wall, they also tend to pull away even further (with Hard/Very Hard difficulty, reason why I play both of those difficulties its because I am a veteran with racing games and its fun for me to play harder difficulties), I attend to try closing the gap but they just keep pulling away, tracks like COTA and Okutama Sprint, they attend to pull away.2. I JUST GOT BLACK SCREENED AND I HAD NO OTHER CHOICE BUT TO UNINSTALL IT. Hopefully I get my♥♥♥♥♥♥back if not then im getting my money back.3. This is not Grid I expected to be. After my experience with Grid, this Grid is the worst of them all meaning its BORING AS ♥♥♥♥, Its more focused on serious gaming and I wasn't expecting that on this Grid, please cancel this game the only fun thing for me is Oval racing with IndyCars and that's pretty much it.

												GRID Autosport promised to be a combination of all things great about GRID and GRID 2, which of course sparked a great bit of hype for Codemaster's upcoming racing game, and I myself went as far as to preorder the game with high expectations. I had enjoyed GRID 2 with my friends for countless hours, and a unification of both games sounded to me like what would be the greatest racing experience for the PC. Codemasters truly did do a great job combining the two games and Autosport boasts fantastic graphics and gameplay mechanics. However, to the dismay of it's fanbase, they had actually subtracted one of the better features of the game with the addition of the disciplinary and vehicle class systems for races. One of the best parts about GRID 2 was the ability to use any car of the event's tier you had desired. There's amazing hilarity and joy in racing an X-bow against a GT-R, and going head to head with racers of all disciplines and varieties, but in GRID Autosport, players are restricted to use class specific vehicles in races, for example, from 20 available cars for a drift event in GRID 2 down to a measely 3 in Autosport. There is no challenge against other players. I love the GRID franchise, but Autosport's discipline system really kills the enjoyment of racing with friends. I sincerely hope and pray that Codemasters considers returning the Tier system or implementing a type of Free Class for multiplayer matches in a upcoming patch or downloadable content to return GRID Online to it's most enjoyable state.

												Codemasters quickly recycles the widely panned and commercially unsuccessful GRID 2 into GRID AutoSport, the third title in the franchise.While the physics and handling have been mercifully changed from drifty to grippy, almost everything remains the same; limited number of maps, never-ending menu pages and options, insufferable lobby wait times and regional locking in multiplayer matches that prevents players from finding each other without Steam 'download region' manipulation.Multiplayer matches are often lag-ridden disasters and are almost always marred by collisions (both accidental and deliberate) despite long standing complaints and suggestions for improvement from the Codemaster customer base.  A painful grind through neverending levels of cars, disciplines and options was soon to be revealed as nothing more than a sinister DLC scheme with the release of the ""XP Boost Pack"" that promises to alleviate the pain of progressing through this game.  With yet more DLC coming soon from this unapologetic publisher, other aggravating elements of this game will likely be revealed as little more than deliberate problems designed to attract the player to purchasable solutions.Luckily enough for racing genre fans, Codemasters will finally face serious competition later this year with the full release of Assetto Corsa, Project Cars and 'Next Car Game,' all titles that will hopefully realize that racing fans would like to spend more time on the track than in menus and lobbies and once they have purchased the game, they'd appreciate not having to pay more to dodge its worst elements.

												Best racing game on the market for car people and anyone who loves cars. The graphics are great. The gameplay is better. This game really nails having a feel for the car. I can drift, go fast whatever and never feel like its super ""arcadey"". The cars feel natural. This game balances simulator and arcade racer very well.  My favorite racing physics engine in a long time. Makes it fun to drive for hours and hours. Solid  online community of great racers. But sometimes it can be hard to find a game through matchmaking so I rely on my list of friends ive met playing/racing, the club system by codemasters, and the community pages to find quality online racing lobbies.

												Autosport had a lot of potential. It's a deliberate step towards a more serious racing game, and brought a lot of features that fans wanted. The game looks brilliant on paper, with a superb selection of cars, better physics, a new AI and glittering graphics. Sadly the reality is, it's a very technologically impressive game but not very enjoyable to play.Autosport, at several different levels, feels like a game trying to be something it isn't. It advertises itself as a hardcore driver's game, and yet plays like an Arcade Racer. It feels outdated as well; the graphics are outstanding, but the AI and physics feel years behind the competition. If it was priced accordingly, it would be a big hit. Unfortunately, it's priced as a AAA title, which it very much isn't.The driving Physics just don't match the game Codemasters were trying to create. Autosport feels like an Arcade racer; not even a Simcade, but a full Arcade game. Cars drift effortlessly almost by themselves, pull insane G-forces and reach ludicrous speed on the straights. I don't mind stylisation, but selling Autosport as a ""hardcore simcade"" is like pretending Mariokart 8 is a Formula 1 team's simulator.The AI feels much the same as the physics. This isn't a proper circuit-racing AI; it doesn't behave at all like a racing driver, with no thought to rules or self-preservation. It's extremely aggressive, and will frequently ram you for no apparent reason. It also shows some significant perception-related bugs: it will occasionally drive into solid objects at full-throttle apparently unaware that they're even there.			",55,2,12,6,8,0,13

												++++Shiny graphicssimple menus------You have to slow down too much to make any turns without flying off the road. That's no fun. Otherwise handling felt very good.Courses were bland. Where are all the races OUTSIDE the tracks? Who wants to drive on track all the time?Codemasters doesn't value your time. I learned this after trying to play online. 1) To find any players, you must change your download server setting under steam to UK-London.2) No easy jump in/play multiplayer3) long multiplayer load screens / waits for other playersI'm a big arcade racing fan, and I like high speed but I just couldn't find myself enjoying this game due to the issues I had listed above. I'm not going to spend any more time trying to force myself to enjoy this.If you're interested in tryinng out the gameplay yourself before purchase, I'd suggest looking at one of the older Codemasters games on discount. The handling hasn't changed much.I'd recommend instead: Blur, Sonic and All Stars Racing Transformed, Mario Kart series, NFS Hot Pursuit 2010, Burnout Paradise, NFS The Run, NFS Most Wanted 2012.

												I WANT MY MONEY BACK... NOWWhat in te blue hell is going on? Alright game looks and sounds great.... looks go down hill in the cockpit area... check my screenshot or play it yourself, but my biggest concerns are that you can't quit the race in the middle of it.. but more importantly THE CAR SLOWS DOWN LIKE IT HAS BRAKES ATTACHED TO IT WHEN YOU STEER.. I am a huge racing fan and gamer. Gran Turismo games, Forza games, F1 series and Project Cars and many other and in none of them this crap happened even once, even in NFS (apart from Undercover with a controller even..) I got sooo frustrated as I couldn't go pass anyone or even win the qualifying session. I tried on very hard and when I went down to medium I still was unable to do it, due to ridiculous steering mechanics. Please fix this issue and especially the graphics of the cockpit, because it looks like a cockpit from PS1 era..			",38,0,7,1,6,0,1

												GRID Autosport has been one of my favorite racing games for a pretty long while now. That being said, I don't recommend this faulty software for anything over $15.There are countless instances of saved games being corrupted irrecoverably. My first save profile was suddenly corrupted, making it useless. All of my time spent on my profile, all of the cars that I've worked months and months to buy, since you can only get a new garage slot after leveling up. This gets to be a MAJOR grind, especially when you've done it before. After I started the game up, I found my latest profile, which was even more accomplished than my previous corrupted one to be corrupted. I shouldn't need to back up the very hard to locate save file every time I start the game. This has made be very disappointed, because GRID Autosport's gameplay (multiplayer in particular) is rather fun and has kept me interested for many many many hours. Hours that gone now for good.Codemasters, the publisher of the game did promise a fix for the save corruption back in November 2014. It doesn't work.Here's my bottom line advice: If you want the game, don't buy it on steam. You might want a refund at some point. Steam doesn't even answer help tickets anymore, and would never give a refund for what I perceive to be a DEAL-BREAKING defective product. I definitely wish I could get a refund, as I play games expecting them to not remove 900 hours of playing put in.If I was to play GRID Autosport again, I have no cars, no money to buy cars, not enough garage slots for even 5 cars. It would take me a long time of playing to get back to where I was, and here is what it comes down to: it's not worth the time. The game isn't good enough to be allowed to steal my time.I don't recommend this game due to a major defect that has persisted for years now. Fixes were promised, never delivered.On the other hand, if you find the game on sale, and you're not too serious about racing, it's a fun game that is twice as expensive at it should be allowed to be.

												Reinstalled this game and would have liked to race tonight but no...First as I started the game it opened in a really small windows. Googled the problem and downloaded some random software that makes the game borderless. Wohoo! It makes the game run fullscreen.Then to apply controls. To the settings I go and save them. First race and my car won't steer or stop. Wtf? The settings have been reset. Oh well. Reapply the settings and off we go...For two races at a time. Because the game freezes every now and then. Maybe the random software I mentioned before or maybe the games just glitchy. Don't really care anymore.Every race is the same. I think in every race that I raced today the top 3 was allways the same. Me first, Ravenwest team second and thrid. And my teammate last.			",100,3,9,10,7,0,31

												Ok you people gonna hate and dislike it , but yet i'll just tell what i felt by playing .. thisFirstly , freezes and lag into the main menu. Sounds good for the beginning. Then after finally set my controller , i passed into graphics options and tried to set it. Then i ran a benchmark ... All ok ... Until it started drop from 200 FPS to ... 10-15 fps with freeze and lags. Such great. I also noticed you can't go back on desktop, the only way is to force it ctrl+alt+suppr and task manager. Then the gayme will set in windowed mode , and i didn't achieved to put it back in fullscreen , ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ settings didn't worked.Ok then , let's have a look to the career mode. First race , dropped into a car. Game decided to cancel my controller command and switch back on keyboard. Ok , ok , ♥♥♥♥ing game but i relaunch the race. Just to discover i'm stuck into a blurry dark non working interior with not a single working gauge. The only way for me to know if i was in a good gear or not was the screaming of the motor after a sharp turn. Oh wait , i got something more fun ! Let's remove sound ! Indeed , after completed 1 turn , the engine sound just vanished. Purely no way to tell if i was still going forward or not.So after that , and after watching the ♥♥♥♥ed up reflection effect and other weird textures, i finally completed the race.All this combined let me a pretty bad feel about the game. So yes , starting a raceday. AGAIN , a ♥♥♥♥ing non working interrior , no way to tell which speed or gear i'm currently driving. So after a last spinning after a turn because i switched - without knowing it - into neutral , and finished into the grass , i just clicked the red cross (Because still no way to put it fullscreen).Unfinished game , with ugly textures , bad sounds and ♥♥♥♥ed up mechanics.Let's summarize itCONS- Bad sound- meh graphics- ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reflects again , Codemaster signature- NO WORKING INTERIOR AND NO GAUGES- Weird menu- FPS Drops and lags- Windowed bugged- Can't leave benchmark mode- dlcPRO- Uh ... Got cars ?I would've refund immediatly if i bought it on the Store and not on Humble Bundle. I regret i waste 10mn pluging and updating my PS3 controllers pilots. Another Codemaster crap.

												I pre-order this game and have been trying to get a refund ever since.Please, do not buy this horrible game. The AI is some of the worst that I've ever seen. The cars handling in the game is very bad to be realistic feeling, and on top of that you can't custimize your difficulty level that well.I absolutely loved grid 2d which was why I pre-ordered this game to see what this company was capable of and if they would meet my expectations. Not only did they not meet my expectations, they have lost my trust as a customer. I don't have that to say about many games but owning this game literally offends me because it is that bad and was that broken on release.I can't tell you if they have made any changes to this game, but I will say to buy this at your own risk or to just not buy it at all. If you want a racing game forza is now coming out for PC on windows so just buy that instead it will be a much better product, hell this isn't even a product I'd call it a scam.I don't have many no recommendations to hand out as usually I'm a pretty fair and unbiased critic and can cearly state the ups and downs of a game. The only ups this game has is looking pretty and nothing else.If you really want a racing game that is fun and has its own unique style of racing then try out Grid 2, that game is amazing.If you want a similation racing game then just wait for Forza to come to PC, and I think the beta is free to participate in right now as well.Do yourself a favor and do not buy this game.

												I first started of with Project cars. I am a big big fan of Japanese cars and my favs are the WRX STI, Skylines, RX-7 or RX-9 and some other JDM. Project Cars only have 1 Japanese car which is Lan Evo X which is a big dissapointment. Where are the other Japanese Cars? owh well the review starts here:PROS:-SImple UI-AI are a kinda aggresive(Some people says its not good but for me, it trains you to watch your surroundings especially in Online mode)-Japanese Cars(one of my biggest reason why i bought this game)-Okutama Sprint( I am a Inital D fan adn Wangan Midnight fan but i dont want to play arcade games and at the same time i still wanna drift like Takumi)Cons-need more Car selection ex: Supra, Lancers, AE86(Toyota Trueno) and more JDMs.-The tuning need to be more detail(Project car's tuning is omg awesome)IF IF IF IF this is a biiiiiiigggg IFProject car's tuning details + Grid's cars +both Project Car's and Grid's tracks in one game.. this will turn out to be a really great game.. but still those who wants to get into Racing sim, try this one first.. if you like it.. go  but racing wheel and start driving like Takumi:)			",100,5,3,19,11,0,8

												Most akward game ever. It isn't fair when it comes to taking corners, because whatever you do, the competition always outrun you. I know that you are not supposed to finish 1st everythime but the 1st and 2nd place in every race always finish 2 or 3 second ahead the 3rd place. The ramming by the other drivers doesn't make sense either. They ignore you completly and ruin your perfect driving.

Other than that its fun. Cross between simulation and arcade driving. Different car almost every race. You race for a team in the events, in which ever car that team has. You have the option to pick between 2 different(cars) teams. Helluva game for $5. Graphics are pretty good too. I have more to explore with this game too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't know what to freaking say about this game other than Dirt 3 is a GREAT alternative that doesn't cause anywhere near the same amount of frustration.Fun aspects:+ Feels like driving a car on a track sort of+ Good force feedback on a Logitech G27+ Fun to throw supercars on a time trial track and just driveNot fun aspects:- The AI accelerate faster than you off the line- You're usually in 16th so it takes laps to catch up (your event rival is sometimes in 1st even)- You have the beat the rival in 4-6 lap races -_-- Even if you win, your team never does because your teammate SUCKS- Ravenwest drivers do some physically impossible stuff (ie higher speed cornering, not damaging etc)- The driver that flipped over can be seen in your mirror catching up to you at twice your speed- No consistency with FPS on different events (have to constantly mess with graphics settings)Really not fun aspects:-- Penalty forces you to drive super slow-- The driver behind you suddenly touches your bumper causing you to spin into the grass then get a penalty-- The driver in front suddenly brakes causing you to try and stop into him then spin into the grass getting a penalty-- The driver behind ignores your existence in a turn and pushes you off-- The AI constantly ram through you because their cars push like twice the boost yours does?-- Everyone's got the same car as you AND STILL ACCELERATES FASTER THAN YOU GAAAAAAHI still recommend because I don't mind playing it in small amounts. It makes me want to throw my G27 out the window if I play it too long.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I already own and play Project Cars, Assetto Corsa, good old Grand Prix Legends, Dirt Rally, etc and I find this game really fun and kind of relaxing in between sessions of the other more sim like games.  Really fun and looks great if you download the high res texture pack.  If you have a GeForce card definitely use the ""GeForce Experience"" and ""optimize"" the game, this should set the resolution to 2715x1527dsr (dynamic sampling resolution) then just reduce the Multisampling in game from 8xMSAA to 4xMSAA (it's in the options menu) and Voila 60fps or better even in smoke and looks absolutely awesome!!!

												Remember playing the first GRID game alot on the 360. Loved it but did not enjoy the fact that races/Laps were too short and did not give me a chans to learn the track. This is now fixed and it feels just a bit more like a ""simulator"".The fact that the cockpit view is not as well done as inte the first GRID did not take away as much of the realism as i feared it  would. If you are on the look for an arcade racer leaning more towards Simulator you can´t go wrong with GRID Autosport./Slap on the butt cheeks			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: October 2, 2016
												I’ll first say that the biggest problem with this Grid game is that it is horribly confused.  I can’t, for one, imagine what the goal of the design team at Codemasters was on about with this one.  The first Grid Game was a clear step away from the simulation like TOCA games (while retaining some realistic physics), which seemed designed for the interested car enthusiast who knew of Le Mans and Touring Cars, but didn’t want to fiddle with transmission set-ups or differentials.  The second game (Grid 2) was a lean towards the tuner/Need for Speed crowd.  Grid 2 wasn’t bad—but wouldn’t you rather just get a Need for Speed game if that was your thing?  So, this game, however, seems born terminally confused about where to fit in on this spectrum of realism: from TOCA 3 to Grid to Grid 2/Need for Speed.  So on the one hand, it has got (arguably) more realistic physics and car models than in the original Grid, with, in turn, more of a harden focus on racing.  And it does seem almost like a call back to a game like TOCA 3 (one of my personal favs).  But, on the other hand, here’s where it really grinds my gears, so to speak.  It’s decidedly not for car people—actually.  It assumes you know something about racing, but it gives you numbers and bars for car stats.  You don’t get to see horsepower ratings or weight measurements, etc., nope.  Not for you.  The game kind of assumes you know about oversteer, understeer, what different drive types do for handling, and about touring cars and open wheel, and various different race real-world tracks, tire blowouts, racing lines and car damage, and semi-realistic physics, but realistic stats?--I guess not.  Its kind of indicative of the entire games problem.  It doesn’t understand its audience.  It holds back.  Another example of this is Codemasters did everything in their power to replicate real race cars and tracks, but allowed no options for you to race with anything like real racing rules or penalties.  It should at least be an option for those more inclined right?  They should satiate the fantasy of a more hardcore crowd if they are going to get us pumped for at least somewhat realistic racing! Right?  I know this is not F1 or anything, but it is a little weird they went so far, and yet still thought it might be too complex or something.   Another example is Codemasters poor handling of endurance racing—which is a cool idea—but its just not an effective game mechanic.  The tire wear mechanic is isolated to one part of the game, so what you learn in the endurance racing part of the game is irrelevant in other racing events.  Its awkward and entirely oversimplefied, and a real shame, because Le Mans endurance racing in Grid was so tense and dramatic (you raced a course for 24 white-knuckled hours, luckily this only meant 24 minutes in game, but it was still quite intense).  Unfortunately, endurance racing in Autosport just doesn’t capture that same feeling, and it is hampered by a poor and underdeveloped tire game mechanic, which is not realistic or fun.  Luckily, the other racing types are uneffected.However, I will give the thumbs up to Autosport, because it is a step in the right direction.  It may be a bit confused, and you might be a little bit disappointed if your have more sim interests in this genre, but  it does do the mechanics of how a car corners and drives well.  It by no means is super-realistic, but it does allow us enthusiasts who love cars and racing to have some fun, while not feeling like millions of hours of mastery and a technical manual are needed to compete in the game.  Its probably for those of us who have a gamepad, but not a wheel.  Not to say that you couldn’t do this game with a wheel, but if you have a wheel—you probably already have more intense games than this.  The good news is its not Need for Speed.  And that’s good news after the likes of Grid 2.  And it is certainly more realistic and sensible than Dirt 3.  At the very least, the game has realistic premises and racing revolving around real cars and somewhat real physics.  But, bare in mind, the game leaves you absent from team management, any kind of realistic tuning, and the buying and selling of cars.  Which are sad things to see go from the original Grid—ironically, the game I consider a be a notch bellow this when it comes to realistic car physics.  But, with all that said, this is a good start.  It just happens to be one of those games that comes so close to greatness—you want to hate it, just a little, now and then for what it could have been.  One step further into the car and racing world would have cemented it.  A more immersive atmosphere, with better mechanics and racing pedigree, would have made it perfect.  Right now it is a good car game, with decent AI and physics, that has some oddly casual pretensions in some areas—so it can seem like it is missing key features at times.  But, I do enjoy firing up a Cat B Touring Car for a spin now and then.  It revs throaty and the track feels good under the tires.			",51,6,2,6,14,0,23

												At first I didnt know whether to buy this game or not... considered the reviews and said, ""F*** it, might as well.""It's a great game with an awesome combination of Racing simulation with the fun that an arcade style racing game provides. Graphics are stunning yet in a way 'economical'. I have a HP laptop that only has intel i5 with no Radeon or Nvidia but it still plays lag free with the graphics on high. GRID Autosport is a massive step up from GRID 2 in many ways. The most noticeable being the awesome new gamestyle and storymode which unlike GRID 2, does not become boing after a while.Pros:GraphicsStory ModeNew Menu's & HUDGamemodesGameplayCons:The steering isn't quite as crisp as it was in GRID 2			",19,2,4,3,9,0,2

												Many people want a realistic racing simulation, not a racing game.Codemasters tries to please everyone, it's a nice challenge but it actually makes frustrations in both worlds, nothing technically overwhelming though.Pros:- Mostly good physics- Mostly good graphics and sounds - Mostly good UI (nice and smooth)- Wide variety of cars and circuits- Many settings available- Upcoming Linux supportGameplay cons:- Hugely annoying inrace slowdown due to penalty (Most stupid decision ever that ruins the game)Physics cons:- Lack of friction that leads to lack of grip- Steering soap effect partially corrigible with settingsGraphics cons:- Not readable dashboard in the cockpit view- No cockpit rendering when looking sideways- Geometry of cars not detailed enough- Skid marks sometimes buggyUI cons:- Too many useless choices at the begining (waste of time)- Awkward sequence: choice of discipline, then choice of circuit, then choice of car- Very slow loading of cars during selectionSuggestions to Codemasters:- Use a button to switch the focus and make the dashboard readable- Allow access to the speed information during the replay- Don't stop the replay when the user switch to another application- I'm a code master, contact me if you have any question ;-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Yo.Now (when I'm doing this ""review"") I only have 13 hours of this game. But I've played Grid 2 for a + or - 110 hours, and I still prefer the Grid 2..The physics of this game are a bit ""strong"" compared with Grid 2, and the developers made this game (Autosport) a bit more hard. I use to play Grid 2 and Autosport in medium and you notice a difference between them.Some PROS of this game COMPARED with Grid 2:  In Autosport:     - You have cockpit view (camera, whatever);     - You have, I guess, more challenges;     - You have now + or -  a thorough car customization;Some CONS of this game COMPARED with Grid 2:  In Autosport:     - Like I said before, the physics changed to worse;     - The tracks are a bit boring;     - You have practically the same cars here and in Grid 2. The developers didn't put many new cars in the game!!And yeah, thats it, probably I'll update this post..Sorry for any English mistake..(y)WrAp3r,			",179,38,12,16,16,2,22

												Pretty much TOCA 4. If you disliked the GRiD/DiRT switch and found F1 and GRiD 2 to be a disgrace, you'll probably love this. You get a bunch of cars, from WTCC, DTM, Supercars, UTES, F3, Indycar and prototypes that you can race on lots of road and city tracks, day or night, reverse and alternate layouts. It doesn't feature the rallycross and other half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥trucks and rally stages, so it focuses a bit more than older TOCAs. Looks pretty amazing, with great performance on lower hardware, tight controls with basic car setup options to fix any issues, great track models, variety, a custom championship mode with lots of options, but only 5 events. The AI can get pretty fast for a good challenge, but it hits you pretty often, causing you penalties and spins even when there's a lot of room to pass cleanly, so that's annoying. The car interiors are terrible, but I prefer the dashboard view, which is perfect for visibility and feel, like in the NASCAR games.  Had some problems, like the save game disappearing, certain options being reset, and obviously it wouldn't be a modern Codemasters game if they didn't chop off some tracks and cars to be sold separately. It's a shame, but it doesn't detract from the fact that this is their most solid game in over ten years. Too bad their reputation will keep players away. Never expected to like this game so much? 5-lap battle for 3rd place at Bathurst in a DTM Audi, hardest difficulty and no assists? Yes, please. That was awesome.			",153,26,29,13,18,1,26

												I personally impressed with codemaster since dirt. Grid : AS offer great experience of competitive racing gameplay, clean UI, nice music that fit the game well, for me its worth every penny than those other mainstream big title. Get the game downloaded, my friend drop by and tell them i just got dirt : AS, run the game and see split screen session, put my RIG on the living room and connect with my 4K tv, as workstation and personal gaming station at least my RIG have one title on my game library that can be picked as couch game whenever my friend drop by.

Not only play destruction derby at Silverstone for example.The downside is that you acctually need the DLCs to truly enjoy in.			",77,5,18,9,34,1,29

												Is this a horrible game? No, definitely not. In fact, it's not bad at all if you like the arcade style. It really comes down to what type of racing game you like. If you liked the first Grid though, you should probably avoid. I can't recommend this game, because the first one is simply better on every front and almost certainly less money every time.I can't think of a single reason why you would buy this game over the first Grid if you're more of a racing sim kind of player, so if you've not had that yet, save some money and have a bit more fun too!If you're a full on sim racer, go for Asseto Corsa or Project Cars. Better yet, get Gran Turismo 6 for your PS3!			",94,1,9,10,11,0,5

												After playing this game for about 30 minutes, I just wanted to quit but had to go through various menus and sub-menus before quiting to the desktop which takes too long. I just wish sometimes the developers could just have it where I press Escape and a menu pops up to save and quit rather than loading up many menus.The game itself is good, graphics are good but probably not the best in the world. Gameplay wise is okay but maybe you need a steering wheel to feel the adrenaline of driving. The damage to vehicles are good, but I didn't see any drastic crashes such as roll-overs and pile-ups. When going the wrong way around the track, it appears the other cars disappear which spoils the upcoming excitment of crashing into oncoming cars.The music and sound is good, voice over is good which also mentions your name IF it's in the database.When I first launched this game under windows 8.1, it launched in a window even though the graphics setting was set to full screen. I had to exit the game and restart to enable the full screen mode. This maybe a bug when first launching this game.Overall, after 30 mins of playtime, I give it 7 or 8 out of 10. I just need to play around with it more. But I hope the developers will come out with a patch to have an exit menu pop up during the game rather than the sub menu system which seems to take forever to exit.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Grid, for me, is the fastest route to Carpal Tunnel Syndrome devised. That is if you use a keyboard to play it. Outside of that, every game I have ever owned I had for the sake of fun. I always use the easiest settings to learn and to have the fun I thought the designers intended. After becoming familiar with the gameplay I eventually raise the difficulty levels for a more challenging experience. Not here. And for both reasons (leaning more towards the first) I deleted the game. On the other hand, The Gran Turismo Series is an excelent example of this type of graduation through the levels of diffuculty. Then again, that's just my opinion.			",10,0,1,0,1,0,1

												GRID Autosport is a pretty good game.I wouldn't say it's amazing, but it's certainly not terrible either.  The AI have their flaws, and some aspects of the game get on my nerves at times.  I'd still recommend it to anyone who's a fan of racing games though.  This is more of an arcade racer than a simulator in my opinion.  You don't get to do much of any customization to your vehicles like you do in something like Forza Motorsport on the Xbox 360.  Some teams that you can race for allow you to tune your car (a little, or a lot depending on the team), but you can't change your colors, decals, vinyls, etc.From an Achievement Hunter standpoint, this is a very grindy game, in that many of the achievements require a lot of repitition and grinding to unlock.  Some of them also require DLC, and the multiplayer achievements will be VERY hard to unlock, seeing as not too many people play the multiplayer anymore (sadly).All in all, it's not terrible, but it's not outstanding either.  If you can try it before you buy it, that might be wise.			",37,1,1,5,0,0,0

												Well, there is a lot i dont like about this game, so il start with what i do. I like that the driving model seems to lean more towards sim than previous Grid games. The braking model still needs a lot of work, but its moving in the right  direction. I also like that its one of the few games that actually acknowlege drift as a valid brach of motorsport. I also like the inclusion of cockpit view, if not its implementation.So what do i dislike so much about it, well here goes. Why oh why would they remove the buying of cars and customising your team livery. That was one of the best things about the first grid, it felt like your team. Now its just a sucsession of meaningless contract races and the only progression involved is watching some XP bars go up. Thats literally the progression, no unlocks, no buying cars, no customising, nada. But without a shadow of a doubt mybiggest gripe is the ommisin of pitstops. After damaging my car mid lap, i thought id pit and get some repairs. Spotted the pit lane entrance line, dove towards it, and hit a tyre wall blocking its entry. Really this is sub par for a racing game even if its trying to fit into the ""simcade"" category.Now the multiplayer looked a lot more promicing in terms of progression, with a garage you could presumably fill with cars you actually buy, maybe even customise them. However after the stale taste i was left with by my singleplayer experience i didnt do much MPat all. I felt like they had gutted the best bits from SP an then tacked on a worse version to MP.My advice for a winning grid title would be. Include pitstops, I mean really its a car game. Have a large garage we can use for both single and multiplayer, earning the same currency in both modes. Give us back team customisation, this really connects the player to the game. It makes it feel like its ""yours"", not a borrowed ride.ProsStunning graphicsDrift evetsFireworks at spa!ConsNo pitstop featureNo team customisationBraking model still needs workThis could have been a great simcade racer, but the singleplayer experience dosent connect the player to the team or the car. The progression is terrible, nothing there to unlock, just watching bars fill up with different colours. All the ingredients were there, but for me its a ""go backand try again"" moment for the grid franchise.As i mentioned though i didnt play much MP raceing, maybe id have gotten a different impression if I had done more. But after my SP experience i didnt want to go any furter with it. Very dissapointing :(			",48,1,5,5,2,0,7

												I can recommend this game certainly. This game is good example of a game of the racing genre. Grid Autosport shows us a great graphics of tracks and cars, everything is designed to the smallest detail, areas are as in the real life, they create you an impression that you are there what you can compare with the real life situation. So you see.. you can find a lot of pluses in this game. I`d like to continue describing them to you because i`d like to highlight these details and facts which can give you an advice to buy or not to buy this game. The game can be boast of it`s reach list of cars, tuning and upgrade packs and tracks. There are lots of cars and etc. There is no any problem. There are cars of different makes of different countries and disciplines. As for disciplines they are very different that was feedly marked in grid 2. Autosport shows 5 car sorts: street, tuner, endurance, open wheel and touring cars. They enclude coupe, super cars, gt, gtr cars: gt3, gt1, formula cars, touring cars, prototypes and other different car classes. I like cars and i like that sphere and it`s main for me, that`s why i`m descrimbing thats oll now. I think car disciplines is a main thing in that game because cars of one discipline can`t race with the car of different discipline but can race with the car of the same discipipline and that is simply realistic.(in contradistinction grom grid 2) Remember the first grid game- racedriver grid. I think that and lots of other things were borrowed grom that game that weren`t found in grid 2. Tracks are olso very realistic and hard. And I can give a big plus for these details to grid Autosport. I think the game had managed with them. But everything that i`ve just said is not so important. YES it`s certainly important for the game but not so much as other main details. Car`s Hadling! Codemasters made a normal and more realistic and involved handling than in grid 2. In my opinion the present grid`s handling is better than in grid 2 and such handling should have every game of the racing genre. the present car`s handling can ""undestand"" only an advanced racing player therefore i can recommend  this game to a player of such sort. About auto`s handling we can speak for a very long time and lots of players hihlight this fact. I think the hanling and lots of other details were borrowed grom Racedriver Grid. As for me racedriver is the best game (Bue racedriver grid!)in the grid series*. I`ve noticed these similarities with racedriver in Autosport. And it`s good that the creators added to their trird grid game classical traits grom their first grid. Now summarize. Grid Autosport has lots of pluses. But it has some minuses which were left lesser then in grid 2. I think the game is not finished. Yes, its finished but i think the creators from codemasters could do everything better and more evolved. There some storages in the game. I can`t describe them. Maybe this game is a little boring and less impressive then the last two games or something else. Probably this game shouldn`t be  the most gameability among the this genre players. I think people from Codemasters can do better games. All is in their hands. Generally Grid Autosport is a good game and i recommend it to advanced players. As for me I like this game and I don`t have any reasons not spend my presious time on it.			",17,0,5,0,0,0,0

												I find this game to be fairly enjoyable, but not great. The controls feel very ""floaty"" (don't feel like you have as much downforce as  you might expect to have) and the cars have a tendency to drift, even in the high-downforce, open-wheel class.With that said, this game is clearly not designed as a simulator. If you are interested in a simulator, I recommend looking to Assetto Corsa or Project CARS. If you are looking for a semi-acade racing game, GRID Autosport is an okay choice (but still, not a great one).6/10			",60,4,10,5,24,1,18

												I'm a really big fan of SIM racing games such as Assetto Corsa and Gran Turismo so when I decided to pick this game up I wasn't expecting much. It was really just to be a relaxing game that was a new addition to my library. However, I was extremely surprised at how much fun this game can be. The physics are simple. I jumped right into the open wheel championships and couldn't stop driving races. The AI are competitive and I'm sure you could make this game extremely difficult with the AI set to max settings. I would really recommend this game if it is on sale and you're looking for something new to add to your lineup of racing games. Certainly not a sim racer, but definitely an excellent all around racing game.			",3,0,5,0,1,0,1

												Get this if you like your multi disciplined motor racing and less arcade style drifting physics. Get GRID 2 if drifting and street racing is your bag. Oh and if you like tyre smoke you probably want Grid 2 as well! If you like coming first in races and then being put in last position on the next race then also consider buying GRID Autosport!

												In all honesty, I don't think grid 2 was bad so saying does this rectify the wrongs of grid 2 is a hard question to answer. The menus are slicker the cockpit view maks a return, new tracks, new cars and teams where you can boss your teamate around. Flashbacks stay and there is a racing line feature - which is cool. Like grid 2, the cars are hard to control but once you get the hang of it you'll have plenty of fun. The problem is that you have to download better graphics and my account got corrupted. 7.5/10			",5,0,6,0,1,0,0

One of my headtracking softwares for my VR headset was messing with it. This game was meh. I did not really enjoy it. It's pretty much the same as Grid 2, but with first person and the first person was not that good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the first time I refunded a game. This game is not bad, but just not suitable for me. All I wanted to start with was getting a car to practice on a track before starting a career mode, but in the first hour I just couldn't figure out how to do that. I needed to enter the career mode and try all the buttons in a race. How could I won a race without practicing with a car on a track in a sim? The graphic is great, and run smoothly on ultra without a lag. The handling is OK, it's not totally arcade, but not a pure sim if compared to Assetto Corsa. I would say it's like Forza maybe. I wanted to keep it but I felt it difficult to just pick a desired car to run on a desired track, and then after an hour I lost my patience so I refunded the game and went back to Assetto Corsa and Project CARS.

												My Uncle was a smoker since he was in his teens. He started around 13 years old. He met his ex-wife about 5 years ago. She hated smokers. She said, ""If you want to be with me or see your nephew grow up healthy, you need to quit smoking right now."" My Uncle knew that I loved him, and he knew how much influence he had on me. He quit smoking immediatley. Two years later he got diagnosed with lung cancer. I saw someone I loved very sick and the thought of losing him was very real. My mother saw how worried I was and said, ""Promise me you will never smoke. I don't want to see you like him."" I agreed. My Uncle survived, but I never smoked anything. But now, I feel a slight sense of regret of never trying weed or cigarettes, because this game gave me cancer anyway.Just kidding. Its good fun, but I suck at it.			",32,4,1,3,3,1,1

												I can recommend this game certainly. This game is good example of a game of the racing genre. Grid Autosport shows us a great graphics of tracks and cars, everything is designed to the smallest detail, areas are as in the real life, they create you an impression that you are there what you can compare with the real life situation. So you see.. you can find a lot of pluses in this game. I`d like to continue describing them to you because i`d like to highlight these details and facts which can give you an advice to buy or not to buy this game. The game can be boast of it`s reach list of cars, tuning and upgrade packs and tracks. There are lots of cars and etc. There is no any problem. There are cars of different makes of different countries and disciplines. As for disciplines they are very different that was feedly marked in grid 2. Autosport shows 5 car sorts: street, tuner, endurance, open wheel and touring cars. They enclude coupe, super cars, gt, gtr cars: gt3, gt1, formula cars, touring cars, prototypes and other different car classes. I like cars and i like that sphere and it`s main for me, that`s why i`m descrimbing thats oll now. I think car disciplines is a main thing in that game because cars of one discipline can`t race with the car of different discipline but can race with the car of the same discipipline and that is simply realistic.(in contradistinction grom grid 2) Remember the first grid game- racedriver grid. I think that and lots of other things were borrowed grom that game that weren`t found in grid 2. Tracks are olso very realistic and hard. And I can give a big plus for these details to grid Autosport. I think the game had managed with them. But everything that i`ve just said is not so important. YES it`s certainly important for the game but not so much as other main details. Car`s Hadling! Codemasters made a normal and more realistic and involved handling than in grid 2. In my opinion the present grid`s handling is better than in grid 2 and such handling should have every game of the racing genre. the present car`s handling can ""undestand"" only an advanced racing player therefore i can recommend  this game to a player of such sort. About auto`s handling we can speak for a very long time and lots of players hihlight this fact. I think the hanling and lots of other details were borrowed grom Racedriver Grid. As for me racedriver is the best game (Bue racedriver grid!)in the grid series*. I`ve noticed these similarities with racedriver in Autosport. And it`s good that the creators added to their trird grid game classical traits grom their first grid. Now summarize. Grid Autosport has lots of pluses. But it has some minuses which were left lesser then in grid 2. I think the game is not finished. Yes, its finished but i think the creators from codemasters could do everything better and more evolved. There some storages in the game. I can`t describe them. Maybe this game is a little boring and less impressive then the last two games or something else. Probably this game shouldn`t be  the most gameability among the this genre players. I think people from Codemasters can do better games. All is in their hands. Generally Grid Autosport is a good game and i recommend it to advanced players. As for me I like this game and I don`t have any reasons not spend my presious time on it.			",17,0,5,0,0,0,0

												Out of all the racing sims available, and I have all of them, this one is still the best.  Projects Cars looks better, Asseto Corsa has better physics, IRacing has the leagues and community, RFactor2 and its ""subsidiaries"" have loads of realism,  Forza has countless cars, etc., etc., but this game is very well-rounded in all of those aspects despite not mastering any of them.  IMO, the damage model is simulated extremely well and can be comparable to Dirt Rally.  I've seen some wrecks that really blew my mind and many of them were without my direct involvement and rather the end result of the Ai simply pushing their machines beyond their limits.  I'm glad there is a rewind feature for those moments.  And the Ai are incredible.  Other than iRacing, I don't play against online players.  Simply too many factors can work against me.  So, I rely on really good Ai behaviour and you get it here.  I can't begin to describe how well of a job Codemasters has done in programming the Ai.  They're not too hard and not to easy, not overbearing or sloppy/wreckless.  The best Ai I have ever raced against.  Awesome.  There are many good racing sims out there, but this one is a must-have.

												GRID Autosport is a great game. It has many great things like good graphics, nice sounds, lots of cool tracks, many awesome cars. But then there's the AI. Oh god, the awful AI. The AI is way too agressive. They don't know where your car is, which brings problems like being spun out by a rival car or trying to go up the inside of an opponent when there's a big enough gap for your car when you enter the corner, but in the middle of the corner the AI forces you into a wall. They just don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about your place on the track and sometimes they force you out wide, which is fine in the corner, but at the exit of the corner, they force you into the wall. Apart from the AI being♥♥♥♥♥♥and basically ruining the single player experience and the cockpit cam being♥♥♥♥♥♥(will get to that in a bit), it's a good game. The online is cool (eventhough it's fairly dead), the physics are nice and the menus are easy to use. The reason I said the cockpit cam is♥♥♥♥♥♥is because of the way the devs blurred everything. The dials are blurred, the mirrors are blurred, the steering wheel is blurred. Basically everything except for the windows is blurred. I like to drive first person. If the dials are working and the rear view mirrors actually have a use. The mirrors being blurred creates the problem that you have to look back manually, which may cause you to drive up a slow opponent's♥♥♥♥♥ which is fun *cough cough*It are just 2 things, but they are 2 big things able to completely ruin the game for me.Good job, CodeMasters Racing....Well done....

												After playing Grid 2 and having mixed feelings, mostly because it felt like a repetetive taks, I was hoping Autosport would win me over. It did not. Like its predecessor it feels more like work than play.While I enjoy driving physics and the immersion which is according to my taste for an arcade racer, I don't get the carreer mode at all, which feels like it is designed to ""burn"" my time, e.g. in some classes you have to do races twice in succession. This reminds me of grinding, which kind of feels strange for a racing game. This is emphasized by the fact that your progress is only shown by XP bars and in return you get naught.Example:You can not choose your cars in career mode. You get left with choosing a class and then a team, which participates with certain fixed cars in the available events. So if you want to drive a certain brand, you are out of luck unless Codemasters decided to put them in the fixture.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't consider this game if you are a hardcore racing fan.It has bad physics that have some hints of trying to add braking points and throttle control but its far from realistic. The cars lose grip too easy and the AI cars seems to have different physics compared to you. I don't need to even mention that the AI cars have a separate line with awkward braking points that you cannot follow.The game is more of a last gen game where the graphics are very cartoonish at many angles, don't get tricked by the game trailers that are post edited. I only bought this game because I thought it would be like the F1 series games where the handling is more or less predictable and can relate to real track behaviour.In my point of view, this game is a arcade racing game marketed as a racing sim			",8,0,4,0,1,0,0

												I don't know what to freaking say about this game other than Dirt 3 is a GREAT alternative that doesn't cause anywhere near the same amount of frustration.Fun aspects:+ Feels like driving a car on a track sort of+ Good force feedback on a Logitech G27+ Fun to throw supercars on a time trial track and just driveNot fun aspects:- The AI accelerate faster than you off the line- You're usually in 16th so it takes laps to catch up (your event rival is sometimes in 1st even)- You have the beat the rival in 4-6 lap races -_-- Even if you win, your team never does because your teammate SUCKS- Ravenwest drivers do some physically impossible stuff (ie higher speed cornering, not damaging etc)- The driver that flipped over can be seen in your mirror catching up to you at twice your speed- No consistency with FPS on different events (have to constantly mess with graphics settings)Really not fun aspects:-- Penalty forces you to drive super slow-- The driver behind you suddenly touches your bumper causing you to spin into the grass then get a penalty-- The driver in front suddenly brakes causing you to try and stop into him then spin into the grass getting a penalty-- The driver behind ignores your existence in a turn and pushes you off-- The AI constantly ram through you because their cars push like twice the boost yours does?-- Everyone's got the same car as you AND STILL ACCELERATES FASTER THAN YOU GAAAAAAHI still recommend because I don't mind playing it in small amounts. It makes me want to throw my G27 out the window if I play it too long.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Been playing this game a long time now, and i wouldn't normally bother reviewing games. But this one seems to cop a bit of flak and i can't for the life of me figure out why. This is a proper race driver game. It's not a full simulation sure but its damn close. It's a brutal game at the best of times.. almost strategic.. If you don't brake at the right time/take the wrong line around a corner/too much throttle and you can lose it all and i ADORE that in a game. Having said that i love the flashback ability and how you only get a few of them to use. They really come in handy and will have you sit there and ponder how you could have done better/alternative stradegies. It does not kill the experience and the game is far far away from being too easy. AI is absolutely brutal and its scary as hell when you are winning and you can hear their engines behind you closing in. Speaking of scary stuff.. How about barreling down an F1 track and having your front tyre blow (in cockpit view). Or that moment you realize you've not remembered x corner correctly and you see wall. OR even better.. When the AI stuffs up ( and they do.. and its spectacular) as they go flying over the top of you. Or spin out right in your intended race line. The other thing i adore about this game is the Mini coopers/classics races.. All of the cars have a very real feel to them. If you're in a mini.. it feels tiny and nippy and they are SO MUCH FUN to drive. And most of the mini races do nothing for your points so they are there just to have fun with. Other realistic features i like: The game feels genuinely stressful to play if you're trying to play serious. A real race driver would be stressed out. The noises.. the whole game feels chaotic like a racetrack would, You hear the car at work, If someone smashes into you and you lose a window.. everything outside gets louder etc.. The opponents being right behind you is scary stuff. The feel of the cars..you easpecially feel when you have damaged something quite badly and it feels like it should.. If you break your suspension you hear all the bumping around and it feels harder to control. Lighter cars feel light, F1 cars feel really damn quick and make you think about EVERY MOVE. The only way to play this game is with full damage on. Id also recommend playing it with at least a 360 controller.. I don't have the time or money to buy a full wheel/pedal set but i imagine that would be an even sweeter experience. I could go on forever about this one. I tip my hats to the devs.. My favourite car game to date. AND its cheap.			",49,4,5,7,16,1,3

												GRID Autosport does a lot to correct many of the issues I had with GRID 2. The cringe-inducing, over-the-top presentation has been toned way down. The narrator and your crew chief speak in a calm, non-irritating voice, and they generally only tell you relevant information. For example, when an accident occurs during a race, your crew chief no longer feels the need to inform you. Instead, you might hear the stadium announcer take note of it over the loudspeaker. It's a small touch, but it goes a long way towards adding realism to the game and alleviating a lot of the annoying dialog that plagued the first two games in the series. The game also doesn't have fake SportsCenter clips or any other such nonsense. The focus here is on the driving. On the track, GRID Autosport can be challenging, exciting, and frustrating, just as any good racing game should be. I found the handling model to be a good balance of fun and realism. It requires far more thought, caution, and finesse than GRID 2 did, but it's not nearly as punishing as a true simulation. On harder difficulties, the AI offers up stiff competition, and they race each other in a believable fashion. 16-car races offer that perfect balance of chaos and control, and they can be an absolute blast. In contrast, time attack and endurance events offer you plenty of opportunities to dip into that zen state in which you can focus on hitting every apex and shaving off tenths of seconds here and there. GRID Autosport's mix of different racing types do a lot to prevent boredom. When I was getting a little tired of one style of racing, there was always another that I could easily switch to. Visually, this game is gorgeous. With the high-resolution texture pack installed, car models, buildings, and other in-world objects look fantastic. While earlier Codemasters games often used ugly filters that would wash out colors, GRID Autosport's environments are bursting with color, and the lighting model makes everything pop fantastically. The city stages are borrowed from GRID 2, but I don't blame them, as these are teeming with detail that make them a sight to behold. Famous buildings and landmarks, background details like descending passenger jets, and a nicely modeled crowd all go a long way towards adding to the immersion. For as much as a racing game can have an ""atmosphere"", GRID Autosport nails it. If you're looking for a game in which you can slowly amass a gigantic garage full of exotic sports cars, this game is not for you. This game is not Gran Turismo or Forza. Nor is it Assetto Corsa or iRacing. You don't buy cars, you don't upgrade or customize cars, you barely even tune them. This is a game solely about racing, as the title suggests. So long as you know what you're getting into, you won't be disappointed. I was pleasantly surprised by GRID Autosport at almost every turn, and it gets my recommendation for anyone looking for a solid sim-cade racer on PC.			",249,70,34,18,27,7,34

												If you are looking for a racing game inbetween simulation and an arcade one, this is the game. You can jump behind the wheel in a lot of cars, and drive them on a lot of tracks with various circuits (GP, National, Reversed etc.). It is similar to what Grid 1 had to offer, and does not make all the errors Grid 2 made.There is still penalty given if you cut track.Singleplayer career is awesome, multiplayer is not too bad either, tho there are always players who just wants to watch the world burn. Side by side action is not so often, and 30-40 percent of the time one of the two participants are knocked off road, or forced to use a FLASHBACK, which is still the dumbest thing in a racing game.Controller/Wheel is recommended, tho I've seen a number of players beat everyone with the keyboard, so that shouldn't be a setback.If you are looking for a more serious racing sim, go play assetto corsa or wait for project cars, or if you just wanna have fun with cars, turn towards the needforspeed series.I do recommend this game, not even the singleplayer gets boring, multi is there also if you want to challange other players, and in every week there are 5-6 new RaceNet challenge to compete in.

												It's a great game.A bit different from Grid 2 which was basically drifting all corners. It was just too easy, like too casual. I liked Grid 2 but then I got this game, which is miles better (pun intended).The game seems much more matured and actually has five categories for racing, which is great to have different racing styles instead of just normal ""Street"" racing: Touring, Endurance, Open Car (Similar to F1 or Indy Cars), Tuning, and Street. This organization is great. At first, this game appeared to be not fun at all. More like a simulator, a boring one. But I now have the hang of it and had to get used to actually braking on the corners instead of drifting all of them. You have to be strategic with the corners, not oversteering or understeering. That's what makes it fun. Plus, the list of features added goes on. Small things like the racing line, and many other difficulty settings added, an assortment of cars, quite a bit of tracks, TONS of cars. Yes some of the tracks were recycled from Grid 2, but they were good tracks anyway, and also improved.Overall, I've been hooked on this game lately. It is just a fun game to play, which I would rate a 9/10 ",28,2,4,1,5,0,17

												My take on Grid Autosport.Good PointsBeautiful Graphics, The track and cars look brilliant with the HD Pack cranked right up makes it just delicous to look at while racing.Mechanics, The game in itself is very good not full simulation but enough to keep the ""die hard"" racing fans more then happy.Eveything all in all is very good, nothing you can really say that is truly bad about the gameplay or the multiplayer versions of the game other than some racers as like most MP's want to ram and spin you off rather than race cleanly.Bad PointsTC/ABS the assits in multiplayer you should be able to disable either ABS OR TC not have to have both off which makes for some really good on the edge racing, but alot of people that aren't used to racing without ABS, will steam down the home straight and lock up, wiping out 2-3 racers at the start of a race.DLC - Just not enough cars even with all the DLC needs to be atleast another 2 car packs to come to make up for some of the race classes that only have 1,2 or 3 cars unless it is a specific race class of course. Needs more older cars aswell as newer cars,  A porsche or another daily drive supercar wouldn't go a miss or even some more hot hatchs to blast round with.DLC - Again frustrating really.. If you are a player with DLC all the cars should be availble in the selection list even if the host doesn't own the DLC you do. As for tracks then they shouldnt be of course avaiable to those without DLC making them unable to join a game but for cars they should be unlocked at all times along as you own the DLC to use such cars.Multiplayer rammers can be a bit annoying when they purposely crash in to youre car, rendering it a complete wreck and have to retire, But on a side note it can be fun when you are waiting for the ram and you give it a bit of flick and they slam right into a wall so i guess it is a trade off really :)Drifting for me i don't think it is very good but that is my opinion maybe other drivers really enjoy the drift on Grid Autosport.Overall the game is pretty awesome but a few little things that i don't like have dropped it a point or i would of gave 10/109/10 not too shabby.

												If you like any of the previous GRID games then you will be happy with this itteration. It combines both simulation and arcade racing. There are pretty severe downfalls to this game however, and it does truely ruin the experience.The singleplayer is a decent experience. It is the typical arcade style menu system in which you choose a race out of a list and take part in it. Compared to GRID 1 it is very simplistic. You simply pick a race, pick a team and go! You still have a team-driver taking part with you on most events and have the ability to change his driving tactics. All of this would have been great if the AI weren't so clumsy. On the easier difficulties (easy or medium), they are extremely slow and easy to win. Even with inexperienced gamers. However, as soon as you pick a higher difficulty, they become extremely aggressive, ignore the player and drive with the strength of a tank. You will be span off the track constantly. Having only played online with friends (not publically either), I cannot comment on the entire online experience, but it is pretty good. When the online lobby is first created, players can join fine, the first race is usually flawless. However, oftentimes there will be game-breaking desychronisation issues on some races after that. One main issue I keep encountering is where the AI will not load for the players properly. The host will see ALL AI, but some most will not move and stay at the starting grid. Other players will either see the same, or not see any AI at all. You and your players can race fine (although unfairly) but the race will never end since the AI haven't even moved from start line yet. There are MORE issues with online, that will most likely never be fixed by codemasters.In conclusion, I recommend this game IF you like any of the previous GRID games AND if you can get over the constant bugs and flaws with AI and connection issues. It is fun (for the most part) and is ever so steadily improving with DLC. Hopefully Codemasters will at least attempt to fix the online issues before pumping out even more DLC for a broken game.

												AI in this game is total Crap and makes this game more a frustration than a joy.  And if you have a G27 race wheel dont expect to use the clutch, it pops into neutral randomly, which makes it totally worthless.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I originally got this game as a simulator to train on as it has the Mont Tremblant track on which I drove a Lamborgini on last summer with G1 Tour. It helped allot as the instructor even said he was impressed with how well I knew the track. After this I ran the race series and am really impressed with the game. Great race simulation fun.

												I'm changing my review since now I'm a grown up and mature racer.If you can't be bothered configuring your steering wheel and are after to some keyboard racing get itIf you like multiplayer racing get itIf you are after for serious simulation racing err... just pass and shyfully look awayIf you are after single player just pass awayIn short:- not many online mathces due to localization (Greece), quite a shame- no cockpit!- just a bunch of circuits in different layouts (inverse, short/long, etc)- long waiting times during online racing-/+ car physics are a mixture of arcade with a little (very little) bit of simulation (?), depends on your taste+ quite good graphics overall+ racenet challenges offer quite a challenge+ night conditions!!!Check out the videos below:

												This is an amazing game. Its not perfect but definately a fun game to play for people of all ages. If you are looking for a game that is meant to be extremely fast, then this game is not for you. It is more of a simulator than anything. But it IS FUN. If you want something more fast paced then I would suggest looking up Need for Speed:Hot Pursuit. I must say again I LOVE this game.			",32,3,3,2,5,0,2

Hit right into you if you are slow in the middle of the road.When you get bit and stop in the road, you need seconds to recover your speed .AI get stopped in the road, next second they magically keep running you can see them disappear in front of you on the map.I dont know how the AI setup their car.They can both accelerate faster has faster top speed ???WTF???

												A Dk2 Review,I bought this game on sale to use the experimental oculus rift mode (Dk2). I works great! with some tinkering I have it so it plays very smooth with lots of cars, no eye strain and objects in the distance are quite clear. I am more of a racing simulator kind of player, this game is more like project gotham  but I am always open to a new experience on the rift and this one is great. The cons are the car interiors are not that detailed, they are funtional but not detailed (no working gauges not much small 3d details). The menus are a pain because they are not designed for the rift and you have to go between looking at your monitor and rift.Aside form the minor cons this was a great buy for the Dk2 at €9.99 and I really look forward to the Oculus advancments with this game.

												Would probably say that this is the best GRID game to date, hated the controls in GRID 2, they are still not really that great in this game.  But they are a improvement.Great car selection and the fact that they brought back the demolition derby!  Ton of tracks to race on as well.Don't really like the fact that there are some of the classic tracks in the world driven on in reverse, like for example Spa-Francorchamps, that track should never be done in reverse!  But it does give you many many tracks to race from, just think they should of been a bit smarter on some of the tracks that you can do reverse on.			",642,212,51,55,78,14,93

												Wow. I don`t have any faith in Codemasters after Dirt 2. But this is just a big joke. You think the 3rd game in Grid series should better than the 2 previous ones, but no! Career mode is bad, and gets boring fast. If you want to set up car - buy DLC because you almost don`t have any options for racing any other team rather than REVENWEST. Online? Still awful, full of Russians playing it like its demolition derby. No improvements to graphics, but performance is much worse than Grid 2. And of course ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of paid DLC which should be in the game in the first place.Avoid and get Shift 2. Loads of mods, tracks and still better looking.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best racing game I've played in about 10 years.So many racing games these days consistently exhibit 3 very annoying things:Pointless narrative/career management thing where some old racing veteran gives you pointers and you 'work your way up' and/or choose sponsors etc. (Toca Race driver 3/Dirt 3)Unecessarily flashy seizure inducing menus that look like they were created by the Top Gear editing department and/or some needlessly 3D menu that takes forever to navigate and the graphics options are hidden behind the noticeboard or something. (most NFS titles/Dirt 2)Not enough racing, usually caused by point 1 and 2.GRID Autosport has none of that. You play the part of a racing driver, not some rookie, and you're racing from the moment you start the game. The menus are white text on black background. Glorious.Also, unlike a lot of other racers, you don't actually have to win every race because advancement is based on gaining experience. Which is just as well because the races can be very close.You also gain more points by making the game more realistic, and it can be very realistic. To top off all the good points they also brought back support for head tracking.If you like racing games this is probably the best one you can get for the PC just now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I previously gave this a non-recommended because of rubber-banding, but after playing it more I have to revise my opinion.For whatever reason, Codemasters decided to put rubber-banding in for Touring Cars, but the other 4 disciplines have no rubber banding. I'm sure it made sense to someone up there...Ignoring the rubber-banding, this is a pretty good racing game. The four disciplines feel nicely different in the way they drive, making changes to the set-ups in your cars now finally actually makes a difference in the way they handle, for the first time ever there are practices and qualifying, so you don't just always start on spot 9-12, and you can adjust the race lengths from normal to X2, X3 and X5, which is pretty cool. Street racing is as cool as it was in Grid 2, Open Wheel is fantastic fun, and the drifting is longer than in Grid 2 where it was waaaaaaay too short.There are some bad things too. The graphics engine, while running smoothly, is getting really long in the tooth, and they basically copy-pasta'd something like 60% of the tracks from Grid 2 just straight into this one. The AI is still god-awfully terrible and will happily plow into you if you happen to be driving on their racing line (seriously, ♥♥♥♥ you Nathan McKane!) essentially forcing you to drive weird lines so as not get rammed off the ♥♥♥♥ing road by them.The Endurance discipline is a nice idea on paper, but in reality the whole ""you have to worry about your tires"" gimmick just makes you drive ultra-careful which is just plain boring. Coupled with the fact that even at X5 length you only race during night time, but that night time is now just basically a ""slightly darker day"" versus the absolute terror of seeing NOTHING at Le Mans in the first Grid, and it's just a boring chore of a discipline to play through. Racing should be about balls to the wall driving at your limit, not carefully entering and exiting corners so that my stupid tires don't give out too soon.While there is no stupid ""You must gather social media followers to advance races!"" crap in this one, there still isn't the sense of team ownership / deciding on sponsors / buying cars etc from the first game, and I can't figure out why they refuse to put that back in. Here you still just drive for teams with crappy team mates and often crappy cars and it's disappointing.Finally, the in-game commentary has progressively gotten worse from game to game to the point where here it just constantly repeats itself (does hearing a ""standings update"" that tells you your ten points ahead of ravenwest in the overal team standings sound like something you want/need to hear every lap? No? Well, you'll still get to hear it for 30 laps in Endurance Also, enjoy hearing the commentator count down every minute during practice. ""7 minutes left! 6 minutes left!"") and never actually gives you any helpful info. The best thing to do is to just turn it off.All in all, it's enjoyable to race in 3 of the 5 disciplines, it runs smoothly, and you can definitely tinker with set ups to get the cars to drive the way you want them to. If you like not-too-overly-simmy racers, this is worth picking up for $10, but I expect Project Cars to blow it out of the water. (or at least I hope it will.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Over all I like this game, the racing is very different depending on which tour you do and it adds a lot more. Few negatives, there is no way to use the side mirriors or rear view mirriors which I think is dumb if your trying to go for a realstic race. Also the drivers view is very blurry which just comes across lazy. Also if they were to add Pit Stops would also make it very awsome.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Setting and upgrades to cars great...BUT,No online severs/players in australasia!9 times out of 10 you get nudged going into the first or second corner and end up loosing your hard worked grid place only to end the race getting last 3 every race.So many drivers just ram others to spin them out and to get infront. The game is very unfair and not a true measure of the drivers actual competencey as a good or bad racer.They came soooo close to making it amazing but left a huge mistake out. They penalise you to harshly for cutting corners and not enough if u ram others??? wtf seriously. If you can handle never getting the position you deserve and dont mind the occasional rage eg often. Then its not to bad ly made game 7 out of 10 , really really could have been a 10 wtf! were u thinking grid!			",56,1,5,4,4,0,3

												Don't buy this game!I purchased GRID Autosport two months ago and have only been able to play it a couple times. For the past month and a half, I have not been able to access GRID in my game library. I always get a ""Servers Busy"" error message or a repeating ""Play GRID Autosport"" screen that asks to play or touch screen.It seems like a decent game for the few hours I played it when I first bought it but I'm tired of begging Steam to make the game work. Steam customer service is the worst, they are ruining PC gaming.Tumbs up for the game(I guess). Ten thumbs down for Steam.			",1,0,0,0,2,0,0

												I've raced many car racing games over the years but this one just may be the best! It's not impossible to do well in races but a challenge you will meet face-to-face. That's one thing I like :-). I hate when a car racing game makes it so hard to even get anywhere near the top five winning slots. Like all your opponients cars are much faster and pass you like you're stopped. Great graphics, sound and driving realizm. Even really nice (not too talkative coaching). You won't be dissapointed with this well rounded game. Very nicely done. Codemasters has really made a good fun to race game here. Enjoy!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first I didnt know whether to buy this game or not... considered the reviews and said, ""F*** it, might as well.""It's a great game with an awesome combination of Racing simulation with the fun that an arcade style racing game provides. Graphics are stunning yet in a way 'economical'. I have a HP laptop that only has intel i5 with no Radeon or Nvidia but it still plays lag free with the graphics on high. GRID Autosport is a massive step up from GRID 2 in many ways. The most noticeable being the awesome new gamestyle and storymode which unlike GRID 2, does not become boing after a while.Pros:GraphicsStory ModeNew Menu's & HUDGamemodesGameplayCons:The steering isn't quite as crisp as it was in GRID 2			",19,2,4,3,9,0,2

												I read somewhere that GRID autosport was promissed to be an improvement to the original race driver: GRID. unfortunately, it's not. i doesn't feel like GRID. there's no money/sponsor system, there's no american european and japanese region-specific racing and cars. just a bland racing game in my opinion, atleast from the perspective that i expected GRID which by far is my favorite race car game ever.atleast all the money went to charity through humble bundle.

												Yes, yes the game has nice graphics, nice cars, the DLC's are there to rob us, ok, fine, just remember this: leave the  traction control and ABS turned on, otherwise you'll find yourself spinning out of control in the last lap just before the finish line with no flashbacks, at which point you'll start screaming like a mad man and destroy your keyboard, Xbox controller, or that fancy Logitech wheel! Or a nearby window.Because this is what this game does to you, it will make you MAAAAAD!!The camera shake... My God the camera shake!!! One of the worst features of this game, it's annoying, it literally makes you sick and the worst part it can't even be turned off!! Even if you set it to 0%, the camera will bounce your view into new vomiting heights. My head hurts after playing this boring game. Didn't any of the beta-testers saw this before they released the game? Is this a feature now? Making you sick while you play it's a feature now?The controls don't make any sense even with a Xbox 360 controller. They are just to twitchy and non intuitive. There are advanced options in the menu screen regarding sensitivity, liniarity (what is that by the way?), dead-zone, but changing any of those values doesn't seem to have any effect.Combine the awful camera shake and the twitchy controls and an unbalanced AI, which is boring to beat at very easy mode, but kicks your @$$ at easy mode, and you have the recipe for a very annoying game.What happened to Codemasters? Grid was awesome! Dirt 1 & 2 were awesome! Dirt 3 was so-so but still fun, didn't even bother with Showdown. Grid 2? That was a piece of $#!t. But Grid Autosport was supposed to redeem the series, they were supossed to listen to the fans, and how did they listen? By putting an awful cockpit view with no moving dials, low resolution textures, i mean why did they bother? I've played mobile racing games with better cockpit views.This is dissapointing game. I can't recomend this even on sale. I got it cheap, but i pity the others that got it at full price, only to find out that they have to pay extra to get the full game. 29,99 for a season pass? For this game? No thank you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												All i can say is, for original GRID fans, it's what you were hoping it would be!I have a love/hate relationship with Codemasters. The DIRT series has been fantastic, but it was hijacked by DLC and Ken Block. GRID was...well, lets not even begin to discuss why GRID 2 was pathetic. GRID (1) was an amazing game, and if you loved that, then i'm certain that when you play this, you will get a nice fuzzy feeling, reminding you of the joy that you had playing the original grid. As you can see, i have not played Autosport for very long, but i already feel like i can tell you that Codemasters have done well to go back to what made GRID so special. If you're looking for a new TOCA, then this game won't deliver for you - i think that those days are gone for codemasters. With their DLC policy, and their habit of spewing out new F1 games all the time, it's clear that the financial team have had a bit of a deathgrip on the devs who just want to make amazing games with endless content.I know this isn't shaping up to be much of a 'review' of the game, but i hope that this helps to give you an idea of what to expect when buying Autosport. The gameplay is very nice - I use a G27, and the game has plenty of support for wheels. One thing i would suggest is, before you play, get all of your settings in order. For some reason, when i started, there was a 20% deadzone on my steering, clutch, accelerator and brakes which is pretty stupid. Physics are, (so far) perfectly fine, and the AI is much better than i expected it to be. All of my experiences with Codemasters games have had great AI, so it was surprising to me that so many people said how it was 'too aggressive' or 'blind' - In my personal (brief) experience, i have found the AI to be challenging, and rough, but that's how you're supposed to drive! I had a lot of fun battling for positions in an experience very much unlike iracing, gran turismo, forza and raceroom. It's a breath of fresh air playing a game that lets you be a bit crazy at the wheel!The career mode is good, but not as fun as the original GRID. There is a similar leveling up system, but it is a little bit impersonal when compared with the experience that you had in GRID 1. There is no garage on the main menu, and most of the game is very 'clinical', getting you straight into the racing.I have only had  a short time with this game, and i'm excited to play more. I feel that, if codemasters decides to make a new GRID, without terrible, terrible DLC, it will be at the level that the sequel to GRID1 should've been			",29,5,10,6,8,0,2

												Great split-screen!I've played this game in single-player for a bit and it seems good enough. Shiny, fast, quite lavish with it's set dressing too. But I'm gonna extoll the virtues of the split-screen mode.It's really well featured compared to it's competition, which often don't even do a split-screen mode nowadays. This game however gives you an excellent 2 player split with an assortment of options. You get a total grid of 12 cars (including the players) which really helps to up the drama and you can choose to do individual races or group some together to make a championship type affair either through one formula (eg GT cars) or have a number of disciplines in the same championship. You get the option to race at night or day on most tracks and you can choose any of the courses featured in the singleplayer game. You even get a replay, again a rarity in split-screen racing games nowadays.I know not everyone uses the split-screen mode if anyone out there is looking for a good 2 player racing fix. You could do far worse.			",172,45,11,6,16,0,13

												Love this game, but once I discovered that you can't even own your own team, I lost interest. Codemasters giveth with one hand and taketh away with the other. If Racedriver, 2 and Autosport were all mashed together to make an ultimate Grid game, it would be the best driving game ever, simply because it would be so interesting to play. But instead I'm disappointed. Still, good game. Just don't go into it like I did, ready to work your way up ang have the option to experience the game again as the owner of a race team.

												GRID Autosport is not a bad racing game however, there are some flaws that are really shame to appear in this title. Feel of speed is good, as it is variety of game mods and racing clases, no doubt about that and also to finish game campagin or rather career took me about 48 hours only spent in playing career, which is really good. Problem is, that career is mostly about the same with no more options to choose more cars into specific race, more tunning options and to make your progress more interesting, than only unlocking next pack of tournaments.... Also gaining EXP is totally pointless and it serves only to unlock next GRID tournamets. I have wouldn't say a word about that but GRID tournaments are totally the same like the usual tournamets, witch no diversification and thats shame... I have finished main GRAID ledend tournament aned the last race of carreed before credits scrolls is the same race like everything else in the game and thats shame, you will not remmember your GRID tournaments because they are no special from the ordinary one. Also the online multiplayer has no pleyers and thats really shame because progression in multiplayer seems to be more fun that singleplayer career. But in gereneral, I like this game, also model of destruction is very good and its looking very cool, graphics is fine, but in some parts not that good as it should be. I also appreciate cool variety of many tracks.			",118,42,2,6,3,0,5

												If you're looking for an arcade racer then it's ok.If you're like me and spent countless hours mastering driving techniques in racing sims like Gran Turismo and Assetto Corsa then this game will be a disappointment. None of what you've learned about racing pyhsics or strategies will apply here.My favorite is when the AI decides to play demolition derby with million dollar supercars and then I get penalized for going out of bounds. Visuals and sounds are impressive though, no doubt there.			",226,20,7,16,8,1,7

												*edit* I now have Project CARS which is superior to Grid Autosport in almost every way. The below review is therefore outdated.*original review* GRID Autosport gives a simish like feel in the handling of the cars but is forgiving enough to also provide a more arcade like racing experience. It's edge of the seat stuff as you battle around the track, proper adrenaline pumping fun! :)The online multiplayer is a larger part of the game than the single player career mode, but there is a lot of content to choose from here... loads of cars and and tracks as well as the variety provided by weekly challenges from Codemasters in the five different racing disciplines. We have started a Doomcraft club at Racenet for online racing so come along and vroom vroom with us.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Been playing this game for almost a year now and still find it to be good fun mostly thanks to its diversity. It's as easy or as difficult as you like so it should be challenging for players of all skill levels. Career mode has enough to offer to keep you busy and online is nice as well if you're lucky enough to find a lobby where everybody is racing clean and fair. Sometimes it seems more like a destruction derby than actual racing. There are some connectivity issues sometimes, might be my connection but then I wonder why I mostly experience it in this game. Would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a subtile mix between realism and arcade.			",87,4,19,6,3,0,1

I love Gran Turismo because of all the little intricate things you can change with tuning, but I hate the sounds. This game satisfies that with compensation of not as many cars. Now this is no easy task for any game. I love this game. I was a fan of Grid 1 because of the tough handling. This game has more feel with the handling and it has updated cars, tracks, sounds. everyting is up to par. i Highly reccomend this game if your a car enthusiast and want somewhat of a realistic simulation racing game. My only dislikes are that it has DLC (I hate DLC, just give me the stinking game in full) and that After a few hours you get kinda bored. But, you begin craving it after a few hours.

												Great selection of modes from Drag Racing to Destruction Derby to Normal Racing, this game certainly is in my opinion the best 'finished' racing game (COUGH Next racing game is actually not good COUGH). A lot of cars to pick from.Do not buy this game if you are planning to play on a keyboard. Without a joystick or racing wheel the finer controls are completely gone and you are at a big disadvantage to other racers.			",104,5,4,11,18,1,18

												After almost 40 hours and over 300 races in the solo campaign on this game on hard difficulty with my gamepad, I have to say: this game is probably one of the best in the genre that I have played of recent on the PC. I thoroughly enjoyed both Grid 1 and 2, but I put 20+ hours more time into Autosport than I did the first 2, and for good reason too.This game has great diversity in both cars and tracks. On top of this, it also has 5 disciplines: Touring, Endurance, Open Wheel, Tuner and Street. So whether you're into drifting around a track to score the most amount of points, or endure a 12 minute race without burning your tired out, or just want a straight up race, this game offers a lot for fans of the racing genre. Plus, there is a free DLC available for the game that allows you to play a demolition derby mode, much like the previous game in the series.As you race in these various disciplines, you will earn XP and will gain levels based on a) how many races you participate in, and b) how well you do in those races. Once you have reached level 3 in ALL disciplines, you will unlock the first Grid Series Championship event (level 6 = the next and level 9 the last). This will take upwards of 30 hours to achieve, which is why I put so much time into this game. And I enjoyed the ride (no pun intended) :)So, if you enjoyed the previous games or have played other racing games such a the DiRT series or even popular racers on console (e.g. Forza), then I'm sure you will like this game, and hence I definitely recommend it! The car physics are a bit of a cross between arcade and simulation too, so if you weren't a fan of Grid 2 and adored the first in the series, you should try this one out. Plus, in the solo campaign, there's no purchasing of new cars nonsense. You simply pick a team and get given cars to drive in (which, personally, I preferred!).Enjoy! :D			",775,155,50,97,56,10,92

												I purchased Grid 2 some time ago and barely got to play it. There was a bug that made it unplayable. I don't recall exactly what it was but when I googled it I found that the developers were aware of it but there were no plans to fix it. I was quite disappointed.A few days ago I bought Grid Autosport and much to my dismay I have encountered a bug that makes the game unplayable. Another wasted purchase. I am very annoyed and disappointed, especially after enjoying the original Grid. I will not fall into the trap of buying another game from this line.			",26,2,2,0,6,0,17

												First of all let me say that I bought this game and all the DLC in a sale, so my perspective may be different than others.Everyone wants something different in a racing game. Some want a sim, some want the ability to throw throw turtle shells, some want to drive six-figure cars without the real-world limitiations such cars have. When a game doesn't meet the needs of a particular player, it is easy to say the game is ""bad"" when it may not be the case.  I like a healthy dose of aggression in my racing games whether it be from projectiles, or some good old-fashioned rammin'.GRID Autosport falls into a good place on the continum. The physics are realistic enough that there is a challenge, but not so much that I can't drive faster than 60mph without spinning out. The damge modeling is strict enough to encourage clean passing, but forgiving enough that I can use my time-tested ""Get on the inside of the other drivers and use them as a bumper"" conering technique.  The AI is agressive, but not Sebastian Vettel. These factors come together to make the racing feel like an impression of a real race--trading paint, driving at the limit to catch up to the car ahead while fending off the cars behind, stubbornly accelerating while the other drivers start braking before a turn, risking a catastrophic crash to squeeze into an impossibly small space, etc. The flashback feature emboldens you to, as your coach says ""Take some risks"" without fear of runing your race. As you probably know, there are several disciplines and event types but to me the game really shines in the ""Street"" and ""Touring"" modes (in that order).  Even though there are a lot of recycled tracks and you have to play through the series' multiple times to unlock all the cars I've never had a boring race and that's what keeps me coming back. Not many other games have you catching air on the urban-hills of San Fransisco in a Mclaran P1, ramming a Koniseegg Agera sending it flipping down the other side, then making sure you hit the braking zone so you make it through the chiccane smothly.

												Great great game, realistic handling, works excellent with my racing wheel. Great graphics, good sound, good collection of cars.. but the thing that lets this game down badly is the AI. They're stupid slow through corners, and then always faster than you on the straight. You are invisable to them ; The amount of times i've been spun out and had to restart because an AI hasnt slowed down or has blindly turned into me for no reason is outragious.  You constantly get shunted off the track.Even if you have the proper racing line (and if you know anything about motorsports) right of way on an apparent game than penalizes you for toeing a line (after getting shunted by the AI) You think the AI would avoid raming you.Game itself 8/10AI 3/10Graphics 10/10 looks great ",107,3,11,5,6,0,3

												This game truly offers that insanely fun, as realistic as it needs to be single-player racing experience (haven´t played it online) for which Codemasters has gained its renown. I love the older TOCAs and the original GRID, but thought GRID 2 was very very meh, as most of us would agree. GRID Autosport is a great comeback, capturing that feeling of having you put all your racing skills to use (the same ones I apply on iRacing for example) while being not as punishing as real life racing itself.Definitely worth full price for sim/semi-sim racing fans. At 50% and above discount prices I´d consider it a must for anyone interested in racing games at all.			",124,55,13,20,21,0,20

												I cannot recommend this game. The best thing I can say about it is that it is better than Grid2. Much better, but that's not saying much. Is it better than grid 1? In some ways it is and other ways it's not.You can drive in actual races on actual tracks and there are some interesting tracks and cars, but the way they drive without any aids is not realistic at all. It doesn't feel like you are controlling the car, it feels like someone else is driving it or at least taking the car over when you get in trouble.Graphics are OK, I have not tried MP as I am not interested in driving against other real players with this game. As a SP game, assuming you have nothing better and no wheel it's probably a good buy on sale. But with my thrustmaster T500 wheelit feels like nothing is correct. The entire experience is a little off.I know there should be a mod that makes driving better. I'll have to find it because the game has promise to spend some time with, but the weird physics are annoying and I was never able to finish a race. I simply got bored halfway.Grid 1 was not stellar either, but to me it was at least engaging. In fact, I have pages and pages of complaints on Grid1, but after considering when it was released and how both audiences and technology has advanced, releasing a slightly better game than Grid 1 seems a bit silly.

												Grid Autosport is very similar to Grid 1 in terms of racing.  Maybe a little less arcady than the first one.  It gives buyers new cars, tracks, and a chance to play on steam servers instead of Tunngle or something.   However, unless you have some friends to play with, you're going to have a tough time even finding a custom game (which is further limited to whether the host/player trying to join have the dlc being used).  I personally like the campaign in the first one more -- I never wound up beating this one.  I like the tracks and the multiplayer mechanics more than Grid 2 though -- which was overall more arcady  (imagine Grid 1 mixed with Hot Pursuit 2).   The corner cutting mechanic is still unpredictable, but better than Grid 2.  I'd reccomend this game only to those who have some friends wanting to race  (lack of player base).    If you're looking for a solo racing game, Grid 1 is just as good of a buy.  The only feature I occasionally play on this game is the weekly racenet challenges.			",219,41,5,43,11,4,45

												Looks like Codies hurried to win back fans they lost from GRID 2.  This is the game GRID 2 should have been, however it does not feel like it should have been a full priced release. Pros:The handling is an improvement over GRID 2 and much closer to GRID 1.  Drifting will slow you down in this game, not speed you up like it did in GRID 2. GRID Autosport has a great car and track selection.  The online level cap has been increased on this game and will take a considerable amount of time to reach giving you something to strive for.  Online race clubs have been added and a very similar damage system to GRID 1 implemented.  Car tuning such as ride height, brake bias, suspension etc and vehicle upgrades are also available. A generic rear view mirror has also been added.Cons:The point to point tracks are gone.  Seems as though online suffers the same issues as GRID 2. The online community is even smaller, some players still have a tendency to use your car as their brakes for the corner without penalty, and similar corner cut issues from GRID 2 still exist. Players will not be able to join games where the host has DLC the joining player does not regardless of whether or not the DLC is being used. The cockpit view looks terrible and the cockpit view mirrors are not functional.7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Graphic, physics and handling is great of this game. BUT the gameplay is such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. You almost never can drive your own car in multiplayer, not to mention the broken single player. There are 5 disciplines and each discipline has like 8 sub-divisions. Each of those 40 or some divisions has usually 3 cars avaliable to choose from to race in that division. To put it simple, you cannot drive a Mustang against a Nissan 370z since there are not in the same division even though they have very similar specs! What's more ridiculous is cars like Mini, Alfa Romeo 8c has its own class! That means you can only drive your own 8c when you join a 8c-only event. And guess what? You only has 10 car slots to start with. Chances are you buy a car and never have the chance to drive it! I mean, this is such a poor design. I dunno what's gotten into Codies' minds but it's truely regretful to see brilliant contents get absolutely destroyed by the stupid idea of ""Autosport"" divisions.			",79,2,8,9,3,0,8

												Pretty decent racing sim, but light on tracks and cars, however the AI is hell bent on making sure you don't finish, you are the brakes. Even my ""team mate"" (sic)  Is trying to kill me. Also the AI seems free to leave the track at will w/out incurring the same penalties as you, super annoying to follow someone only to be penalised when they are not. Not played online, as the simulated griefing from the AI is good enough to ram, pit, or shove any human controlled car out of the way. More tracks and cars combined with some AI that isn't the police in GTA and this would be up there with the likes of forza/GT ",23,1,1,3,2,0,1

												GRID Autosport hits the sweet spot between racing simulator and arcade racer. The physics pose a challenge on the limits of adhesion and reward a wheel/pedal setup, but aren't so demanding as to require huge investments of time to transition across the many racing disciplines. Graphics and audio are good but are not the focus point of the game. This plays more like a spiritual successor to the TOCA Race Driver series than GRID 1/2 and has filled a void that has been on PC for a very long time. Highly recommended			",372,107,20,61,49,4,95

												DON'T BUY THIS GAME! Continuously crashes on windows 10 as reported by a lot of users.Here is an email I recieved from codemasters when notifying them of the issue (crashed 13 times in 2 hours of play):This version of the game does not officially support Windows 10, so we are limited in the support we can provide unfortunately. [...]We have no plans for a Windows 10 patch, at the current time I'm afraid.			",8,2,3,1,3,3,2

												Would probably say that this is the best GRID game to date, hated the controls in GRID 2, they are still not really that great in this game.  But they are a improvement.Great car selection and the fact that they brought back the demolition derby!  Ton of tracks to race on as well.Don't really like the fact that there are some of the classic tracks in the world driven on in reverse, like for example Spa-Francorchamps, that track should never be done in reverse!  But it does give you many many tracks to race from, just think they should of been a bit smarter on some of the tracks that you can do reverse on.			",642,212,51,55,78,14,93

												Piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ It doesn't even save your controller settings never mind your personal preferences.Seriously avoid at ALL COSTS.  REALLY REALLY REALLY BAD controller support and options settings.  EVERY time you load it up you need to program in your control options, view options and game play settings.  And once they are set there is no guarantee they will be acknowledged.  The vehicle regularly forgets it has steering control, at-least to the right, while accelerate or brake is applied.

												Classy and clean UI screen from the start, in-menu music is apt. Variety of races from open-wheel category to street racing catergory. Customizable difficulty, relative to bonus XP earned. Difficulty setting ranges to Race Line, Flashbacks, Brake Assist and such. Graphics and in-game sound effects are well done. Must buy for Gran Turismo/Forza fans.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Looks like a fun game but won't go fullscreen for me, which drives me nuts and begs me to play other racers instead. Codemasters' response was that my GPU is not supported and I should use my integrated graphics instead (ha!)I'd be more understanding if the game didn't come with my laptop. Why they would include the game with systems they don't support, I don't know.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty much TOCA 4. If you disliked the GRiD/DiRT switch and found F1 and GRiD 2 to be a disgrace, you'll probably love this. You get a bunch of cars, from WTCC, DTM, Supercars, UTES, F3, Indycar and prototypes that you can race on lots of road and city tracks, day or night, reverse and alternate layouts. It doesn't feature the rallycross and other half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥trucks and rally stages, so it focuses a bit more than older TOCAs. Looks pretty amazing, with great performance on lower hardware, tight controls with basic car setup options to fix any issues, great track models, variety, a custom championship mode with lots of options, but only 5 events. The AI can get pretty fast for a good challenge, but it hits you pretty often, causing you penalties and spins even when there's a lot of room to pass cleanly, so that's annoying. The car interiors are terrible, but I prefer the dashboard view, which is perfect for visibility and feel, like in the NASCAR games.  Had some problems, like the save game disappearing, certain options being reset, and obviously it wouldn't be a modern Codemasters game if they didn't chop off some tracks and cars to be sold separately. It's a shame, but it doesn't detract from the fact that this is their most solid game in over ten years. Too bad their reputation will keep players away. Never expected to like this game so much? 5-lap battle for 3rd place at Bathurst in a DTM Audi, hardest difficulty and no assists? Yes, please. That was awesome.			",153,26,29,13,18,1,26

												Many people want a realistic racing simulation, not a racing game.Codemasters tries to please everyone, it's a nice challenge but it actually makes frustrations in both worlds, nothing technically overwhelming though.Pros:- Mostly good physics- Mostly good graphics and sounds - Mostly good UI (nice and smooth)- Wide variety of cars and circuits- Many settings available- Upcoming Linux supportGameplay cons:- Hugely annoying inrace slowdown due to penalty (Most stupid decision ever that ruins the game)Physics cons:- Lack of friction that leads to lack of grip- Steering soap effect partially corrigible with settingsGraphics cons:- Not readable dashboard in the cockpit view- No cockpit rendering when looking sideways- Geometry of cars not detailed enough- Skid marks sometimes buggyUI cons:- Too many useless choices at the begining (waste of time)- Awkward sequence: choice of discipline, then choice of circuit, then choice of car- Very slow loading of cars during selectionSuggestions to Codemasters:- Use a button to switch the focus and make the dashboard readable- Allow access to the speed information during the replay- Don't stop the replay when the user switch to another application- I'm a code master, contact me if you have any question ;-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												On Reflection after a long break - mechanics were a definite improvement over GRID 2, drifting discipline was finally Okay, but still not as enjoyable as GRID 1 had. I enjoyed most of these 150 hours, Endurance was hella fun, to adjust to losing grip, that was fun practice for me.But, man,  i had done too much grind to handle after getting every single event's 'Ravenwest Win'. Which is me doing the full game twice. Should you? No. No Reward. Didn't go past this part in the game.Multiplayer? Not reviewed, i would have, if the drifting was as fun as GRID 1.Conflicted feelings - i enjoyed it, but i am reviewing this as another ""No"" to the series.			",59,8,4,3,2,2,9
