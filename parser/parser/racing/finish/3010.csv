												I'll admit that rally games are my guilty pleasure.  Most feature mushy controls, daft physics or ridiculously undamageable cars.  this has none of those.  The controls are crisp, the physics moderately good, and cars which will fly apart satisfyingly when you ram into a building or errant rock.   The career feature is quite well done, leaving you to decide which cars to buy to win certain races.  It does have relatively few maps (4 maybe?), but  a lot of variety of tracks round them keep things moderately interesting.  Stability-wise, there were very few glitches (I can count them on one hand, after months of play). The car addons actually feel like they're making a difference, and strategic part and tyre-selection can make an impossible stage remarkably enjoyable.The games's only main downside is the repetitiveness.  Only four 'areas', means you get to race the same track over and over in different directions and different combinations of bits.  The openness of the career path does also lead to you making bad choices when purchasing cars and add-ons from time to time.   That means you must  race the same race 10x in a row to get the money to afford the thing you should have bought instead.    The only other small downside is the micro-stutter which occurs when a texture or sound is first loaded.  That can cause you to spin out, or miss a corner (e.g. when the game first loads the copilot voice for that corner).  A quick reload, and it doesn't happen there again.   Other than these small niggles, the game is notably bug and hassle-free.I recommend anyone who likes Rally games to play this.. It's got satisfaction value in spades, and while it's not as polished as Colin Macrae, I think in some areas it beats it (blasphemy!!) :-)			",210,93,7,32,33,0,53

												Key features:realistic driving, if chosen.destructable cars.customizability.The game itself, in my opinion, is worth the price they are asking.The only flaw is that you have to go into regedit or some registry program and edit it to make it playable, but it took me only about 2 minutes to do.9/10 ",147,24,4,12,10,1,20

												We can't buy Richard Burns Rally anymore, but we can buy this instead. It's not exactly a simulation (even on ""simulation"" mode), but it is a ton of fun. The physics are based in reality, and you can use all of the standard techniques to induce oversteer. It's a bit easy to go sideways, especially in a FWD car, but not glaringly unrealistic. I am not a rally driver, but I checked the FWD performance against Live For Speed (an acknowledged ""realistic"" sim) on its rallycross tracks, and I was able to get a similar FWD car (the Mini clone) to oversteer using throttle liftoff and brake, just like I was doing in Xpand. One funny thing is that you seem to be able to do powerslides in FWD cars in Xpand, which is obviously unrealistic. But that's fine, I just imagine that the FWD cars are AWD. The bottom line is that the physics are authentic enough that you can use the instincts you have developed in sims and have fun doing it.Apart from physics and realism, the game is just a lot of fun to play. I have played the first stage about a dozen times, just because it's really fun. If you do nothing but play that first race, it will be more than worth the price. The stage design is one of the best things about this game: the stages are all completely crazy, with lots of tight turns and elevation changes keeping you on your toes without being unrealistic. And unlike many newer games, you don't have to sit through cutscenes, tutorials, and boring intro missions to get to the gameplay. Thankfully, you just turn it on and go right to the good part (the sideways racing).It is an old game, so you will have to edit a configuration file if you want full 1080p resolution and 144Hz refresh rate, but it's easy. The file you're looking for is called VideoSettings.scr, and it's located in the Xpand Rally\Data folder. The settings in the file are clearly labeled and self-explanatory. Have fun!Edit: This game has a crazy difficulty curve. Don't try to drive insanely ""at the limit,"" because some very strange things can happen with the physics at the limit. Instead, upgrade your car and drive carefully according to the pacenotes. Still a fun game and worth $5.			",55,9,22,1,2,0,10

												I have only had this game for a few hours, and I have to say, I LOVE ITI have not played alot of racing games before, but I feel this was a good start.

Realistic steering, drifting, and perspective!Last but not least, GREAT GAME for the price!!!! If you like racing games or interested in starting, Buy this!!!10/10			",33,0,1,0,2,0,0

												One of my favorite rally racing games of all time. The handling model is just realistic enough to be enjoyable, without being too difficult.Non-licensed cars are a bit lame, but you do have some tuning and upgrade options which is nice.Tracks are very varied and the game is overall just a blast to play if you like Rally games.

												Have not played a racing game for years. This was fun, and plays nice with keyboard, no need for a wheel or gamepad. Some of the tracks can be just a teensy bit frustrating, but race another event, get some cash, buy an upgrade and come back to it with a more powerful machine. The constant quest for cash 'drove' me on. 16 hours to beat all events.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I´ve been playing for a while now, the physics engine and the graphics seem fine to me... Menu design and game structure sucks compared to the actual gameplay, but you can get around it with some basic IQ and the will to play a rally game... i don´t recommend this game to anyone not looking to play a rally game, or anyone who has never played a rally game.if you know what ""Rally Championship 2000"" or ""Rally Masters"" means... give this game a try, it´ll last more than a bag of cookies, and it´ll be a decent addition to a rally game collection.

												Bought this game a month or two ago and ive played a good ammount of it. Its pure awesome. One of the best rally games ive played in a long time. It is very old but its cheap and for its price, its an excellent game. Totally worth 5 bucks! Very realistic physics engines and car damage. For example. You try to turn 45Degrees on dry tarmac going 100km and it works vs trying the same thing on dust would not. Also the car damage aspect is near perfect. For example you crash into a tree and your car gets a large dent where it hit the tree.9/10 Good game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was the first racinggame using Techland's Chrome engine and just as I like that game I like this one too.For starters I still think this game has great graphics even though they've aged (see guide for setting it too your desktop resolution) and while it doesn't have an official WRC license or cars it does have an interesting carreer mode where you can buy upgrades for your cars.In simulation mode a good setup, knowing the limitations of your cars and managing your speed accordingly are key to win in this game and I found this refreshing after comparing the driving in this game with the more arcade oriented rally games of the time, only Richard Burns Rally was more realistic.My complaints are only that maybe the setupoptions are a bit sparse and that for newcomers there would be a better explaination on the setups as well as a drivingschool like in RBR, oh yes and that the cockpitsviews are unplayable.Anyway, if you want to have a fun rallygame which is also rather realistic then by all means give this one a try.
