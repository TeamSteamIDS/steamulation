Do I recommended this game for you? No Never. Even not after the awfull patch after 2 months Introduction Dear Milestone,I am very surprised by your work. You've as company improved a lot from WRC 1 2 3 and 4. It is not in the class of Dirt Rally, but it's a huge improvement over these previous games. There are some remarkable things to see; like tracks, cars, graphics, skytexures, and more. I am glad to give you the important points I've found in your game. If you can fix this you can perhaps stand proudly next to Dirt Rally; this means you can challenge each other to be become better over the years. Competition is what we need as customers, as gamers, as rally-enthusiasts, and more. I hope you do something with my feedback and not neglect to support the game. Good luck!The bugs and design choices; highlighted the most important- No auto-center-steering when restart/reset.-   I am using a TX servo base, default 900 degrees, in-game automatic, etc. There is no steering for like 180 degrees from the center, so 90 left, 90 right. - 900 degrees feels like 1800, 540 like 900, etc etc. (Mostly on FWD and RWD)- Old FWD / RWD / AWD feels ackward compared to Modern AWD cars- Can't make tiny corrections while steering. Steering is very rude. - Cars are too tame; RWD's too planted, can throttle 100% out of corners, etc. - Concrete bushes, pole, trash bins and more. No ""rag-doll""- When rolling on the roof you can see though the road- Pause button can't be remapped. -  No subtitles for in video's-  No fov adjustement for triple screen - Very understeery- Setup slots are shared slots for all cars. - Texture pop-ups, like fences, trees etc. - No real damage. Damage is set to heavy, but nothing happens. Only visual.  Seems to be very random- Little to no punctures/flatties; Too robust, but it can happen.-  No multiply devices support; means a different wheel and different pedals will not work together (as example T300 + Fanatec pedals will not work. In other ""sims"" they will) - Bugged keybindingmapping- Tracks too wide, but that's probably a good things with the awful steering on a lot of cars. - Wheel calibration must show the actual wheel degrees; when you go to the right you must have 900% when using 900% degrees. Now you don't know what wheel degrees you will have when you must calibrate to the right which results in incorrect input. What I like- Cars; I want to tame all the FWD's that Dirt Rally has <3- Tracks; they remind me of RBR vanilla. Which are awesome too. - Graphics- Sky-textures- Overall presentation; Menu, Loeb experience.- Triple screen.- Force Feedback, also when lost a tyre. Below the changelog:- Support 21:9 - Good, but no fov-adjustement- Fix Saves  - Good- Support Triple-monitor - Good, but no fov adjustement- Fixed Logitech wheels minor issues - Don't have a logitech- Fixed Time Upload issues - Good- Minor Fixes - No idea what they have fixed. Conclusion The steering is still awfull as before the patch.  It's the same as before... but with triple screen support.  Next time when you release Loeb Evo 2 or any other rally-game please consider the help of Early Access. All your problems could have been solved by Early-Access or experienced Beta-testers. Have a fine day.Ivy. Tips for the stubborn people; Don't calibrate your wheel. Set pacenotes on early or so and steer a lot of meters in advance. use gloves to prevent blisters, cause you need to rotate the wheel a lot due poor steering/handling [/b[Tested with a Thrustmaster TX, T3PA-Pro's, Heusinkveld Seq Shifter, Th8A ",12,2,11,9,3,0,0

												Sebastien Loeb Rally, where do we start. I'm curious as to how much input he had with Milestone, as there are quite some glaring oversites  that have totally been overlooked in this game.  1.) Do the employees at Milestone own a car, and if so, does it have a steering wheel, because this game handles horribly. 2.) What kind of vacuum cleaner did they use for the engine sounds. No immersion at all; the sounds are so bad, it literally makes you want to exit the game. 3.) The ways your car can literally get stuck on objects, you would think it was a magnet at times. Just the total lack of steering input again is astounding; it boggles the mind. During a race, if your windshield gets filthy, you can not activate your windshield wipers. That is only available when it's raining, and  you have no control over it. I own Dirt Rally, RBR, a number of Dirt games, and the old Mobil One Rally Championship from Magnetic Fields, which beats this game even now, and that game came out in 1999. This is the first, and the last Milestone game I will ever buy. It's really ashame, because the stages are not that bad. When you're playing a rally game, you should be able to push your car to the limit, take some chances and for some of the time, not all; be able to maintain control of your car while on the limit.  SLRE unfortunately does not allow you that sensation of speed, or risk taking balls of the seat driving. It's like the car is a pogo stick waiting to bounce you off the road. Any one looking for a rally game that is current, needs to look no further than Dirt Rally. It doesn't have nearly the amount of  tracks, but the immersion and game handling by far out weighs that small fact, and new tracks will be available in the future. I give SLRE a thumbs down!

												it doesn't matter what's good about this gamethis game has steering dampening. and that is so bad that it negates anything good.this means the wheels in the game will always turn slower than you make your inputs.the in game wheels take about a full second to catch up with your inputs.And if that isn't bad enough, the design of the  roads are all flat. even gravel roads have no bumps, holes, or anything like that. sure they follow crests, but they are still just perfectly even surfaces with a dirt texture on them			",109,15,26,24,58,1,28

No support for many wheels, handling is bad ,graphics bad & the servers are empty. Also there already releasing DLC's FIX THE GAME FIRST BEFORE YOU WORRY ABOUT DLC's. $10 tops is what this game is worth. I would rate this game 3/10 and im being generous....			",68,8,25,10,26,3,1

												Well, thought I would give this a go as I like my rally games, was a bit hesitant about the purchase as it's a Milestone game and as usual i was right about my hesitancy.The game looks fairly good graphics wise but trying to drive the car using my excellent thrustmaster t300rs racing wheel is nigh on impossible, i spent ages tweaking the controls and trying differen settings but to no avail, the wheel input seems to have a delay and the car feels like it is hovering across the track plus you cant alter the wheel settings on the fly, you have to exit the game to the main menu and then have a play with the control settings.I've requested a refund and will buy DIRT RALLY instead. Milestone you are almost there but your control issues need some serious work.			",20,0,16,0,1,0,0

The most widely used and generic gaming wheel available.EDIT: I CANNOT EVEN EDIT FREAKING KEYBORD CONTROLS ON THIS STEAMING PILE OF...I HAVE TO HIT F2 TO GO INTO ADVANCED WHEEL SETTINGS TO EVEN BACK OUT OF CONTROL CONFIG BECAUSE IT'S LITERALLY THE ONLY KEY ANYWHERE THAT WORKS IF YOU HIT THE ENTER KEY TO CHANGE A CONTROL?It doesn't recognise my pedals. I literally CANNOT remap this game to make it recognise anything.......... I can't comment on the game itself. I've yet to test it. :SDO NOT. I REPEAT. DO NOT BUY THIS CONSOLE AFTERTHOUGHT!!!

												At this time I cannot recommend this title.  It has promise and could be better so I'll stick with it and see if things get better with more time played (however some items are deeper than a quick fix).  Of my time played half of it was setting up controls and getting the game to run smoothly.I express a bunch of my negative veiws in this review video.

The good, it looks better than WRC 5 and appears to have a better career mode.  Game modes would also be a plus, rally, hill climb, and rallycross something for nearly everyone.  Stage lengths are ok, same as DiRT Rally 5km to 10km.  Pace ntoes are good, intuitive for those who have played rally games the past 10+ years unlike WRC 5.The bad, no triple monitor support.  Oh sure you can select your triple screen resolution but it'll lag just trying to select to type your name in.  Runs fine on one screen.  Handling, not sure how you fish tail a FWD car on tarmac but apparently you can.  Overall the handling feels stupid loose, and not realistic at all.  Stages, I've only driven in Finland but they have made the finish forest roads 1.5 cars wide.  ummmmmm they are much wider go watch some WRC footage.Wheel support, they do support a variety of wheels but even on a G27 you have to do some profiler set-up before even calibrating it in the game.Pace notes, how can they be both good and bad, well they are given in monotone no matter what is happening or the speed of the car.  If I'm going faster and there are successive calls you probably should rattle them off a bit faster.Basically I'll still give this title a chance just because I like rally games but I don't have high hopes for it to improve.Sorry for the wall of text.

												Would i recommend it, as it is now? No. Simply because there are to many bugs. I've experienced alot off stuttering. I've tried v-sync on and off, and it resulted in 2 different problems. For some reason with v-sync on, the game puts itself in 30 FPS for awhile and then suddenly goes up to 60 again. At 30 FPS the input lag is horrible. It's not fun when you have to steer 1-2 seconds before you actually have to steer just because the game doesn't recognize it properly in 30 FPS. With V-sync off i have between 80-100 FPS. The problem is screen-tearing and frequent stuttering (screen-tearing could be on my part because off an old monitor).EDIT: It seems that D3DOverrider worked to get most off the stuttering and FPS problem away. I have occasional FPS drop to 40-45 but it goes right back up to 60 again, so it's not a perfect solution but makes the game playable atleast. Here's a link to the version off D3DO i use: https://hostr.co/5JA4NRt (thanks @Cunin)Now to another issue, car vs road. In my experience the Toyota Celica seem to have problems in Sweden with interaction on the road. It makes it more slippery than it's supposed to. On gravel and tarmac it seems fine though.Here's a clip i recorded yesterday with the issue:  


YouTube™ Video: SLRE - Toyota Celica floating in Sweden - Rammen 

			Views: 226		

			This is mostly a bug report. The car felt very funky and just... bad in Sweden. Now i know why. It doesn't touch the ground as it should and sometimes half off a tyre sinks randomly.		

I've sent this to Milestone in hope for a fix. I've only experienced this with the Celica, so it might be the car itself. Haven't tried any other 4WD on snow yet.RWD seems to be a little funky too, at times. There isn't really any throttle control. I've tried the Stratos and an RWD Toyota and both have the same issue. It feels like there's to much grip. I can't feel it through the the wheel. My settings in the Thrustmaster Control panel thing, is set to 100% on everything except dampening. In-game vibration is on highest and overall FFB is set to 60.So to the physics. I would say it has potential to become very good. FWD is fun to drive and feels really good. Same thing with 4WD (except the Celica on snow). RWD needs more work to reach it's true potential, while FWD and AWD needs some polish.The graphics aren't the best, but they're not that bad either. The stages looks as smooth as a babys butt, unfortunately. They don't feel like that if you crank up the FFB though. What i would like to see is potholes, bumps, ruts, deeper ditches in some places, more stones, something that looks like gravel, not only the color off gravel.Options that are missing is an FOV slider, seat position adjustment, option to remove hands from the wheel/remove both arms and wheel completely.Online doesn't work. Well, it works for some, randomly. I'm still waiting for my verification email (i've checked the spam folder). It's been almost a week since i registered.If i where Milestone, i would put this game in EA instead. It wasn't ready for release yet. Luckily SLRE will get a patch soon and hopefully it'll fix the problems, or atleast the worst off them.			",213,12,8,14,17,1,6

YouTube™ Video: My Painful First Impressions Review / Fixes of Sebastien Loeb Rally EVO a Parody -ish video. 

			Views: 2,206		

			Hey guys I tried to do a different way of first impressions/review video. This one was a lot of work to do but I had fun making it! I hope you can enjoy this too!		

First, I am a YouTuber and G27 Steering Wheel user I have a 38 minutes video review/parody about this game on my channel.And I only played about 2 hours to consider a Refund later.I have about 600 hours on Assetto Corsa, 50 hours on rFactor 2 (recently bought) and about 140 hours on Dirt Rally (main content on my channel at the moment).About the ""Only 2 hours"" criticism: For a racing sim I don't think you need too much time to judge the driving feel of a racing title using a wheel, you can definetly feel how the driving feel/physics are the first moment you turn the wheel on any game/sim. About the content, it is just Dirt Rally with more content both on Cars, Stages and events. Still this is a First Impressions Review.NOT RECOMMENDED TO: -Those who can't decide between this or Dirt Rally or WRC 5 as a Rally game. Get DiRT Rally.-Those that want a casual racing experience.-Those who are not willing to deal with the bugs and can't ignore bad sound/graphics/performance.-Those who don't have a good gaming PC.-Those who have a steering wheel currently not supported on the game, mainly high-end gear. Check forum first.-Those that can't play without a add-on Handbrake or Button Box (No support)RECOMMENDED TO:-Those who are willing to deal with the bugs and can ignore bad sound/graphics/performance.-Those who played hours and hours of Dirt Rally and want more content in general.-Those who want a realistic rallying experience.-Those who have a good gaming PC-Those who have supported wheel. G27 works if ""Allow game to adjust"" is UNTICKED on the Profiler._______________________________________________________________________Game PRO/CONSPRO: - Surprising amount of content on both Rally Stages and Cars from all eras of Rally (More content than Dirt Rally)- Stages are very narrow just like in real life.- Game physics and terrain surface/car dynamics are very realistic, definitely a simulation game if you turn off the Assists. Its debatable if this game simulation/driving part is better than Dirt Rally.- Like Dirt Rally, it simulates the challenges of Rally racing. So it is difficult but rewarding game experience.- Price is fair if you eliminate the bugs and performance issues. There is a lot of content for the money.- Progress and Car Unlock systems tied with Reputation and Credits earning. *We need more of credits based unlocks on racing simulations.CONS:- Unstable game-breaking performance, framedrops and micro-stutters that adds horrible input lag on controllers and wheels- Terrible and limited Graphics options, can only change the already limited options outside the game in a Launcher.- Terrible car sounds design, the sound is rough but the sound positioning is usable.- Mediocre but believable graphics,- Unpolished and very stupid amateur bugs, the game ONLY SAVES if you have ENGLISH UK selected on the Windows Control Painel>Region and Language Settings. -You will get stuck on the Tutorial if you choose it just after making your team because you need to select the type of controls you are using. ALT-F4 is only solution.- Stupid lack of support for simulation gear for a SIMULATION GAME (Common sense, please Milestone) like high-end Steering Wheels, Handbrake, Button Box, Joystick add-ons.- Limited usable steering wheel/controllers/keyboard when in-game, can not use the keyboard buttons if using a controller or steering wheel or controller. Meaning if you use a wheel you can not use the keyboard or joysticks to function in conjunction, I can't use my Logitech Extreme 3D PRO Flight Stick as Handbrake like I do in Dirt Rally and other racing sims._____________________________________________________________________At the current state of the game I DO NOT recommend it, a lot of bugs and instabilities in the games performance. However if you are really getting bored with DiRT Rally and just want more rally content with a surprisingly good driving physics then feel free to get this game a try, you can refund it later anyway.BUT BE WARNED: You must deal with the bugs and annoyances of this game, if you are not a patient guy or gal, then stay FAR AWAY of this game.The lack of response from the Developers on Milestone is very disrespectful to those that want this game to be at least playable with a stable performance.I made a First Impression / Review with some parody video with more in-depth look on the bugs, how to fix them, how is the physics, And other info. If you want more information, please check my video.			",270,67,28,64,41,3,46

												Could be a decent game but theres ABSOLUTELY no dev support. As of today the community manager hasnt even logged on steam for 239 days. So Dont expect any problems with this game to get fixed. For instance , I have a thrustmaster tx racing wheel with fanatec clubsport v2 pedals and I cannot use my pedals. This game doesnt support multiple inputs. So no separate pedals or shifters. So a rally ""sim"" that cant use a standalone ebrake. Hmm			",23,1,23,0,0,0,0

												I know the game has well-known problems like: lack of post-release support, poor optimization, lack of compatibility with simulation hardware. This is Milestone's signature move, nothing new here. But I'm also seeing a lot of people just jumping on the hate train without thinking it through.If you're lucky to be in the compatibility zone (Logitech wheels, single monitor) it happens to be a great sim. Actually, it's more sim-esque than DiRT Rally. DiRT's a much better game overall, but SLRE is able to give a quick fix of nostalgia from Richard Burns Rally. The driving physics are great, very reminiscent of (and easier than) RBR. Cars may not have as much personality as their Codemasters' doppelgangers, but they're fun to drive too. Both games have an awesome, respectable roster of historic rally cars, and I wonder how Milestone managed to acquire Toyota's licensing rights while Codemasters didn't. FWD handling is better than in DR, and the other traction systems, while not being better, give a good feel and never feel unpolished. Some cars have really bad stock setups and require some tuning to run fine, just like happens in DR. And, differently from DR, the downforce works correctly. After 200 hours of DR I was starting to believe cars really do float in the air like they're on the Moon. SLRE's driving pace is more lifelike, DR may get arcadey-fast sometimes (not a bad thing). Of course I never drove a real Lancia Stratos on tarmac, but I bet a kidney that the SLRE's rendition is much more faithful to reality, and boy, it feels good. Small, powerful FWD cars like the Renault Clio Williams and Suzuki Swift 1600 are really fun to drive.For me, the biggest surprise was the track design. MUCH better than in their last rally game (WRC 4), with a lot of narrow, tight sections alternating between wider, faster sections, and many variations of surface and height, all on a same stage. They're not lively and dangerous as in DR, but the force feedback works properly and can be a real handful. Also, less repetitive than DR, since it has more stages than its rival. Mexico, Finland and Sanremo really stand out among the available rallyes, with excellent stages. The game's definitely a grower.Sadly, it lacks a good online component, like the always updated online events of DiRT Rally. Since you get on top of the AI leaderboards, there won't be much to do anymore. Visuals are just OK and sound design is really poor, with a lot of bad/missing sound effects, but the overall package gave birth to a surprisingly good sim, which could be considered the finest rally title today if DiRT Rally never showed up. And this is quite against the odds, since it came from a really sloppy game developer that still can't understand basic, essential things like support, hardware compatibility and community feedback.+ Tarmac FFB+ Excellent FWD handling+ Lots of cars & tracks+ Realistic feel+ Presentation/User interface+ Spot-on braking behavior+ A full journey through Loeb's career+- Gravel FFB+- Visuals+- RWD and AWD handling– Sound FX– Requires some effort to keep game running smooth– Sim hardware compatibility– Support was already dead a month after release– A lot of out-of-sync pacenotes trying to kill you– Citroen's cars are much easier to drive. The bias is strong there.			",133,19,24,1,10,2,11

												Frame rate is a mess and ranges from almost unplayable to completely unplayable. Remember this game was delayed a year! to add polish and fix bugs.The crash physics for the most part are a joke, just search youtube to see some of the most comical moon launches ever... as for the rest, well the ""driving on ice"" physics are strong with this one and don't even get me started on the way the cars handle jumps. If real rally cars handled like this almost all the rally drivers would be dead.The stages are modelled on real stages and that's great! sadly they lack any real fidelity or detail, we have no camber on the roads, no ruts or potholes, instead they all look and feel like baby smooth motorways, the stage edges are mostly solid and lack detail, not to mention some of the ludicrous cuts that can be taken in both the rally and rallycross stages.In typical Milestone fashion we get no support from the devs, no communication. People cant get the activation email to play online (I did, but had to sing up to another email provider to get it!), Major frame rate issues for most, some that can't even get the game to start! I'm luck enough to run a monitor with 2560 x 1080 resolution, I get black bars either side of my screen as the game does not fully support this resolution (the only game in my steam list that does not!). Sim gamers with triple monitors cant use them, problems with multiple input support... the list goes on and on. In 2016 its unacceptable to not support even the most popular, multiple input devices. They have labelled this game as the most realistic Sim in recant times... even WRC5 has better support than this.Don't get me wrong, I've stated in another thread here that I believe they do have a decent game under all the issues. Unfortunately they only seem to care about the console players and we ended up getting a crappy port and will ultimately get no support.I'm not bashing the game, rather just giving my impression of its current state. The company on the other hand...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												either those giving positive or negative reviews, expecially if having a consistent gameplay time count, are basically right about the good and the bad of SLRE (if you want comprehensive details, you may check Zamoy72 or Oyster reviews, i.e.)personally the only hampering flaw I tolerate very little is the co-driver: most calls are unforgivably late (regardless of setting), a lot of times are wrong (Dirt Rally is a paradise, in comparison), so you can't push too much, unless you memorize the stages, ... and by the way, I suggest to use at your own risk the handbrake (quite umpredictable) .... yet I enjoy my point for buying SLRE (and Pikes Peak gravel) is that I've waited, eleven years for Dirt Rally and twelve for SLRE, to come after Richard Burns Rally, and if I want to hope to have new releases again is to support them, as I'd like to avoid waiting another eleven years in this case, my opinion, SLRE deserves the money because, regardless of all the flaws (that are actually there, along with the goods), it represents the change of attitude of a little company, from the arcardish WRC1234 to an attemp to produce a simulation ... keep on			",137,13,2,5,20,0,1

												This game highly exceeded my expectations.The main highlight here is handling. It is much better than in previous Milestone WRC games, let alone awful WRC 5. It isn't very complicated but it lets me powerslide around corners like real rally drivers even using gamepad. But dynamics are realistic, i.e. you have to brake early, especially in slippery conditions. For some reason only a few rally games has got such immersive handling.Tracks are also great, they are using lots of elevation changes, scenery is quite diverse and dangerous too. And for all the purists there they are narrow as hell. But thankfully Pikes Peak lets you breathe freely.No need to explain how comprehensive car list is - go check it out yourself.Career mode is pretty large and it returns to the formula of multitude of small events in different classes seen in WRC 2 and RIDE. ""Loeb Experience"" is nice addition too.In sum, Sebastien Loeb Rally EVO joins the pantheon of my favorite rally games along with Colin McRae Rally 2.0, Dirt Rally, Richard Burns Rally and Mobil 1 Rally Championship. Milestone finally delivers.			",1593,515,169,180,173,25,207

												THE DEMO DOES NOT DO THIS GAME JUSTICE! It's running a old build of the game, the full game i had a +50% performance increase from about 50-55 FPS to +100 now. I don't know what Milestone was thinking but that is the reality. +Many different cars to choose from from different eras of rally+Real stages+Rallycross+Other fun modes+Good pacenotes no robotic sound like WRC5, they are simple to understand+A campaign mode that is a lot more expansive than in Dirt Rally+Also a second campaign mode where you experience Seb Loeb's career as a rally driver+Good handling (not simulator, but not arcade either. Kind of a middle thing)+Steering wheel support for many different brands.+Online multiplayer with leaderboards + PVP+More than 300KM of road. -Sounds are very ""meh""-Damage is wierd and random. Sometimes window smashes for unknown reasons-Milestone still insists on using their horrible launcher-Lacking in graphic options. It's not entirely bad but could be alot better!-No triple screen support-No support for individual componements (if i have a different shifter for G27 it wont work. Even WRC5 has support for this!! Come on Milestone)Still a very good rally game, and definetely worth picking up for retail or discount price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I dont know why everybody hates this game, its actually suprisingly good.If you are someone, who is constatly looking for a Good rally game, that isn't an insane rally simulator, do truly look at this game.If you want to compare between the last 2 DiRT titles, its like the best of both worlds ( EXCEPT THE CRAPPY GYMKHANA HORSE****). Game provides alot of tracks, many car classes, an actual multiplayer feature, WITH RALLY MULTIPLAYER ( LOOKING AT YOU DiRT RALLY), plenty of personalization options and not a bad career mode.Do recommend to take alook, if you find it on discount.

												As of 2016-07-01 the game seems to have been sufficiently patched; it plays really well and looks great. I have a 3 year old PC and this game runs more or less perfectly on it. I've not had any problems so far.Also, there is information on the game's website as to what wheel-sets the game supports, so don't reward reviewes written by people who seemingly made no attempt to check these things up before buying the game. A rational and responsible person would research these things before buying the game.The standout of Loeb Rally is the sheer amount of content, there is much to do in this game and thus it is perfect for single-player gamers ... if there are more of us left than myself that is. Dirt Rally and WRC 5 both have much less content in comparison.Judging by Steam reviews, 98 % of all gamers only care about multiplayer, the same applies to this game ... which is highly unfortunate because it really misrepresents what this game offers.The Steam community's obession with multiplayer is bad for the sim-racing industry, because these gamers are so fickle and only play their games for a short time. Whereas us single-player gamers stick with these games for the long-term.Back to Loeb Rally though. I would liken this game to the first Dirt game, minus the trucks and buggies. You win races to earn credit, which then unlocks more stages. This is also reminiscent of games like Forza and Colin McRae Rally, where you simply won't make progress without effort and grinding.If you only want multiplayer racing I suggest ProjectCars, Assetto Corsa, F1 or Dirt Rally. Better yet, try iRacing ... since it was actually designed and built for multiplayer only.The other standout of Loeb Rally is that all the stages are more or less copies of the actual real-life stages. This means that they are quite lengthy for a rally game, and also feel more realistic or authentic. On the negative side, the stages are not as tough and challenging as in WRC 5. The biggest challenge in Loeb Rally comes from the driving physics rather than the stage designs, which is the exact opposite of WRC 5.Visually Loeb Rally looks great. Some tweaking is always needed as a PC gamer, regardless of genre. We all have to live with this fact, if we are honest enough admit to it that is ... which most ""reviewers"" on Steam don't seem to be.These people don't complain when they have to tweak their Witcher 3 and Fallout 4 games, or their favourite F1 or Dirt game, yet it becomes a sudden disaster when they are forced to tweak certain other games. Compared to WRC 5 and Dirt Rally, Loeb Rally does not look as good visually speaking, it does not have the same crispy depth of colour. If visual immersion is very important to you I recommend Dirt Rally instead.Apart from the SBK games, Loeb Rally is the most sim-like of Milestone's games. It is significantly more techncial and demanding than Milestone's WRC rally games, as well as Kylotonn's WRC 5.Disabling all the assists I would compare the technical difficulty to that of Dirt Rally, they are both very challenging games. The physics itself is quite different between each game though, but 'different' does not mean 'bad' ... it simply means 'different'. All racing games, whether arcade or sim, demand that you as a gamer adapt to their physics.As a side-note, it is healthy to remind people that even the most hardcore of sim-games are still just 'games'. They are poor representations of actual racing. The Steam community's obession with imagined realism in racing games is silly ... because it is just that, 'imagined'.What makes Loeb Rally different from WRC 5 and Dirt Rally: the stages are almost perfect copies of the real-life stages, there's a substantial amount of single-player content, you get a chance to walk in the virtual footsteps of a true racing legend (Sebastien Loeb).What it does better than WRC 5 and Dirt Rally: the sheer amount of single-player content.Where it is not as good as WRC 5 and Dirt Rally: the graphics (especially Dirt Rally), multiplayer opportunities (vs Dirt Rally).I would recommend this game to people who want lots of single-player content, or something that reminds them of the first Dirt game, a game I'm a big fan of.

												05/02/16 - Short review by a G27 and x360 pad rally driver after +70hrs playtime.Nice game, but this GAME NEEDS PaTCHES! INFORM YOU in the forum before you will purchase SLRE! Single screen driver, driver with supported wheels and supported devices are the lucky ones right now, when all is fine with your system. Look below, there is a resolution FIX out (21:9).The DEMO runs not very well. I turned all to low with all settings disabled. Better go for the main-game and use Steam refund, if you do not like the game.

In use is here a G27 rev + TH8 RS & a x360 pad with my i5 4670 @ 4.00ghz, 8gb RAM and a 770 4gb. 2x AA, adaptive sync @1920x1080. Auto track tex, reflections + ai cars low. Motion blur off. The rest is max. Absolute playable. Sometimes i have light frame drops on Finland, Australia and Wales. Rallycross races with Ai are not well optimized, bad slow-downs 45-55fps.The steering feels very good with my controls. Direct without lags.  Decent G27 ffb - not too much, not too less. Only pad driving with external view is too sensitive for me.Good physic, the grip is decent on the different surfaces and the best plus in SLRE are the stages! There is not one crappy rally-stage in this game. I liked them all with good diversity of stage-lengths! PLUS with at least one dlc comes Pikes Peak gravel in your hands! Also this game has a nice feature to save your life-time: Rewind to learn faster the tracks. You can use it, but you must NOT dear ""purists""!Damage present. Experienced flat tires, tire explosions, broken steering & broken transmission. The GFX are decent with good details. Missing here some environmental interactions: animals + raging spectators ;) Game comes with snow, rain and night stages. The sense of speed is great imo. Best rally-feeling i immerse with the dashboard-cam on almost all cars (Alpine dash sux). Cockpit-view feels a bit too narrow specially on some Wales stages @1080p. Lets hope for a FOV-patch.  For better gfx-experience i miss manual wipers to clean the windshield. The after some time limited view is very annoying!The ancient SOUNDS don´t rock - not good. ""Best"" sounds I feel onboard in the Subaru and few FORD cars. Co-driver guides are fine with a lot of infos.Start your engine and try it out by yourself! The best opinion is your own!Fact: I like this game, had a lot of fun with my smile and a blast with my wheel :D SLRE is worth it, if u are a lucky one ;D

PS: My fun-car is the FORD RS200 - >Group B :DLogitech and G27 drivers check this for your wheel setup: Originally posted by ==Guderian==:I have no Problems with my G27 no input Lag or Force Feedback Problems and there is no difference on Force Feedback between Test Drive Sessions and the normal Game for me. I do it so: First go to the Gamecontroller Settings for G27 and to the Advance Panel.Set 900° Rotation and check the Centering Spring Option for Games that doesnt support this to on.Uncheck the allow Game to chance settings Option.Let the Logitech Profiler set on.Go into the Game and to the Controller Settings dont touch the Brake or Clutch or Accelerator Pedals Settings !Press F2 for Advanced Settings and ""do not"" use the Auto Calibration Tool !Set steering Option to manual and 900° and set the Force Feedback and the Rumble Settings to 100% or what Value you want to have.For help: 100% isnt to Hard its exactly the right i think but by the way its not a good FF this can be much better. Exit this Option and set the Buttons you want to have for Actions on Wheel, i repeat dont touch the Brake or Clutch or Accelerator Pedals Settings they set to right Values and work correct.Edit: Ingame you can set whatever degrees you want to have i chanced to manual 540° but on windows gamecontroller settings you need 900° set then it works correct otherwise the 90° to right and to the left bug will happen.

Edit: Recommendation: Use a TH8 RS shifter and take your logi H-shifter as handbrake - gear 4 ;D worx perfect and is awesome fun :D21:9 FIX: http://steamcommunity.com/app/355060/discussions/0/412446890546894535/For me there are only 3 big minuses after +90hrs:1. Bad sound. The engine sounds are really bad music for my ears.2. Missing FOV-adjustments.3. Missing manual wipers or clearer view in the cockpit and dash. I am switching more and more to bonnet-view.			",298,9,39,19,45,0,80

												Experienced a few minor issues during initial setup and first navigation, but I am slowly but surely finding my way around.     TBH I found Dirt Rally, although developing into an excellant Sim, a lot more difficult to setup, steering & FFB setup were/are still a real challenge to get right. This Sim seems to work very well on the standard settings. Graphics appear fine optimised by Nvidia through thier Geforce experiece program. Most settings Ultra or High FPS around mid 90's with GTX 970 Win 10. Content is vast, Stages are amazing. Mr Loeb interviews add something special to the whole experience. So far very enjoyable driving experience. As with all new releases a few minor annoyances are to be expected and assuming that further developments will follow this has all the potential to be a Truly Great Title.Is this, at long last, the Sim to replace the fabulous (but sadly dated) Richard Burns Rally ? Fingers crossed......Update after additional 6hrs use BLOODY MARVELOUS the Online Multi player mode is excellant, all in all delighted with my purchase:)			",0,0,4,0,0,0,0

												It's a decent game if you like rally. But it's a bit of a hit and miss. May work decently on your system, maybe not. Keep your eyes open for the amount of time clocked before making up your mind, that way you can always ask for a refund. Other than that, the physics are decent. Like a middle road between Gran Turismo and Dirt Rally. Sounds are bleh, not good at all. Graphics are decent, sometimes being beautiful and some others meh. Content wise it's great, with a lot of interesting rallies and cars. Pikes Peak track alone make the game worth of your cash.			",174,39,42,44,39,2,50

												There's a good game undereath the lack of audio quality, and at times, visual polish. The physics can feel clunky at times, but if DiRT Rally didn't exist then this would be the best rally game of recent times. When Milestone learn that rally needs great sounds to properly portray the spirit of the sport, as well as smooth physics, then SLRE could be a serious contender for best rally game. They also need to better optimise their games to run on both consoles and PC, because right now they're pretty bad. The content cannot be faulted. Although some of the car models are inaccurate, the sheer variety of both cars and events are second to none in rally games. They've done a great job there, but maybe focussed a little too much on quanitity over quality.Until these things are addressed, (which haven't been since their first WRC title), DiRT Rally will remain at the top for quality, but that doesn't mean you should skip this title.

												This game is fantastic!Let's be straight here, it is not Dirt Rally. That's is a good thing.It is an alternative to Dirt Rally, which is needed for people who actually want to have fun driving.Dirt Rally is great, but it severely punishes for every single mistake, forcing players to retake an entire race after race to the point where you start pulling your hair off.EVO does things differently, it has a completely different approach. It allows you to select the difficulty and enjoy your experience. One thing is for sure, it does not punish players for going slightly off road. EVO is a lot like old Colin McRae games. It is a sim car handling with a bit of arcade physics.Perfect combination of skills and fun make this racer an ultimate number one in rally games.Dirt Rally is for hardcore gamers, EVO is for leisure gamers			",189,21,26,10,6,2,3

												From videos I didn't like the game, but I gave it a go with demo version and I got surprised. The game is actually quite good. The physics are OK, way better than any game from WRC series.PROs:Insane funCareer more of Forza style, not like DiRT Rally so it's everytime something diferrent.Rallycross and Pikes Peak with any carGreat graphicsAs only game has Group SReal Rallycross tracks (rally tracks are not real)Having your own teamLoeb Experience - you can live Seb's lifeYou buy cars, instead of winning them.CONs:Milestone doesn't know how to support low-end PCs (I use 720p on 1080p monitor - 30fps)expensive DLCs and Season Pass6 Rallycross tracks (more than DiRT Rally has, but still...)Event cars with no purpose. They are just the same as normal rallycars, but they are ugly, you can't              change their livery and all windows except front windshield are blacked out, so you can't see a thing!!!! YOU NEED TO SKIP TUTORIAL AND THAN CHANGE SETTINGS. FIRST YOU NEED TO RESET THEM (F1), THAN YOU CAN SET THEM UP. Otherwise there would be no way for you to drive or even pause the game. You can do the tutorial again afterwards by going to garage and clicking tutorial.			",12,1,29,0,10,1,1

												I'm recommending this game. While the lack of polish, lack of key features and numerous bugs is initially off-putting, this game does the most essential aspect, the driving, really well. SLRE has a great handling model, and offers a nice variety of vehicles and a quality set of tracks. Racing those narrow, twisty courses is challenging and very intense, yet intuitive.Driving the rally cars is a lot of fun. On loose surfaces the cars are quite sensitive to weight shifts and you can gleefully throw them around corners. But you have to watch out for high speed corners and for jumps. On tarmac the cars feel planted, but can be easily upset if you are careless (it's hard to recover if you lose traction), and there is good feedback from wheel slip. There are a multitude of surfaces: dry and wet gravel, mud, snow, dry, wet and icy tarmac. They feel naturally distinct and it's a total blast to ride the mixed tracks. The FFB is good. You can feel the SAT, torque steer, weight shifts to the front, etc... It's complemented by an effective and unobtrusive bump/suspension feedback.The tracks are of great quality. Narrow, meandering, bumpy, with elevation changes and varying surfaces. Each of the 8 locations has 4 tracks (2 long and 2 short) totaling about 31 km, plus the reverse versions. There also are 5 RX tracks + tarmac Pikes's Peak. There is not much weather variety, but the night lighting is well done. The career mode is quite varied. It's basically a random collection of races restricted to a vehicle or vehicle class. Besides Rally, RX and Hillclimb, there are a few other somewhat gimmicky game modes. Then there are the Loeb related events: you can unlock some cars and learn about the champion's career.There are a few disappointments. Given the lack of communication from the developers it's possible they will never be addressed.NO FOV adjustment! The dash camera is okay (except for the Stratos and Alpine).Lazy H transmission model. Auto-clutch is always ON; no engine braking, miss-shifts or stalls. Direct H or sequential on a group B is sacrilege! Sounds are mediocre. Co-driver, tarmac wheel slip and some cars are okay. Surface sounds are pretty basic but informative. Some cars sound like vaccuum cleaners. There are a few annoying audio glitches.Co-driver is at times suicidal. Some tight corners are grossly misslabelled; no 1s or squares in the lexicon. Some calls are very late. Some tightening corners are announced but not labelled. Basically be very attentive to ""tightens"", ""caution"", any turn ""3"" and lower, crests, and look ahead! Torsby 2 has no French co-driver. HOWEVER most of the time he allows you to paint a fine mental image of the road ahead.Graphics are okay, but a bit lifeless. There are some really low-quality effects (windshield cracks, water/dust splashes), and I've experienced popping objects and graphical glitches. Bad windshield reflections or dust makes some cars nearly undrivable at night or in some of the shady forest sections. Graphical options are very limited and only accessible via a game launcher.The damage model is basic. The headlights are indestructible. Collision sounds are laughable and often absent, and collisions sometimes lack sense of momentum.In some ways the game is a perfect complement to Dirt Rally. SLRE lacks the polish and all the key features that DR has, but offers a better handling model and twice the content.Now for the sake of bookkeeping here are a few of the most annoying bugs/deficiencies.Very limited multi-controller support; mr. Loeb uses a HANDbrake not a button.Almost all options (buttons, FFB, transmission, HUD, co-driver, etc...) need to be changed before the race.No wheel centering on restartNo gauge/HUD on countdown, defaults to N gearLoeb event car unlocks and wheel rotation ""soft-lock"" are bugged.Using the H-transmission makes all vehicles have 6 gears with crazy top speed  ",69,7,4,2,2,0,1

Posted: February 5, 2016
												!! This Review will change over playing time. Status: 02/07/2016 !!Dear rally fan and dear Milestone team:First impression: much better than expected!Bad things second:1. Microstutters appear very often, even if the framerate is constant 60 per second.2. Wheelsupport is no optimal yet. (Keyboard is not working during a race => only 1 controller is working during a race, so you cannot have for example a G27 wheel and a clubsport shifter together. 3. Many Gravelstages are worse than the Vanilla RBR gravelstages (Mostly Australia and Mexico, Wales is okay for example)! Clearly a lack of time is the reason why the gravelstages are so bad in SLRE (Sebastien Loeb Rally EVO). Road textures are very simple and extremly repetetive and also the the road borders are non existing, looks like a 15 year old game. First impression is that its no fun to drive on those gravelstages.4. No tripplescreen support yet, but with the current performance it wouldnt work yet either.5. You have no tire choice in game, like in DIRT Rally! Sadly i hope they will add this!6. Damage. The damage on highest settings appear earlier after crashes than in DIRT Rally on highest settings, but its still not realistic. Please add a ""simulation mode"" to the damage settings with close to real strengh settings for the car. A 20-30 km/h hard impact can already rip a wheel off! We want that in SLRE also!7. Carsetups are done with sliders and no real values. We want Nm, etc.!To the bright side of the game:PHYSICSThe physics are very good, even from a simulation freak standpoint. Cars over- and understeer like you expect it, like brakes also. Weight transfer works, but not sure yet if this is a bit damped in this game. Clearly Sebastien Loeb had a very good influence to Milestones affort to make a real sim this time. Is DIRT Rally better in this aspect, or RBR (Richard Burns Rally with and without NGP)?! I have no final conclusion yet but what i experienced to far that the tarmac physics are supperior to the DIRT Rally and also RBR Vanilla physics!! I never expected that to be the case, i must admit!Gravelphysics appear good too, but i have to investigate a lot more time to validate this first impression.GRAPHICSSolid. Cars look nice and some tarmac stages are very beautiful and realistic. Pikes Peak is also very nice and bumpy, like the real one. Much better than DIRT Rally Pikes Peak and also much much better than RBR Pikes Peak MOD ;). Again you see where Sebastien Loeb gave most input! You can clearly see where he put his most time in: Tarmac physics, his Citroen Cars and Pikes Peak! This equals his interests and strenghts. I hope soon the other parts get same attention too!FORCE FEEDBACKQuite good, i only have a G27. So i can only compare between different simulations and not judge the full potential of the Force Feedback in SLRE => Better than DIRT Rally and around equal to RBR, but worse then RBR NGP.GAME SIZEMany nice and historic cars. Many many hours of fun :). Pikes Peak is great. Tarmac Rallies also. Long realistic and NARROW stages :)RallyCross is a nice addition and very much fun, i have a smile on my face all the time. I actually have not enjoyed a simulator for a long time this much! Drifting is wonderfull precise and the A.I. is fast, is not breaking too often too early, like in other titles! and also very agressive which i quite like in RallyCross! Its not clean racing like in IRacing, guys! This is meant to be nasty and thats where the fun starts! You can very easily and realisticly turn a A.I car by just clipping this rear end. The cars are not welded to the ground like in DIRT Rally RallyCross! So are you, you can BE turned very easily! So much fun, try it yourself, you wont regret!!All in all i must say this game has the potential to be the successor or Richard Burns Rally (RBR). I am very impressed by the physics. If they/you fix the obove mentioned problems SLRE might be the next ""big thing"" in the rally simulator world! Thanks for reading :)			",36,3,8,3,12,0,1

												let's get this out of the way. I love RBR and I love Dirt : Rally.All that said I don't hate SLRE. I actually quite like it.OK, So...It's not actually a terrible game. The lower class cars feel weird, and have lots of wheel slip during acceleration which makes them understeer like a pig and as a result feel somewhat heavy and clunky.Once you get to the WRC categories (particularly from the 2003 cars onwards) you can tells theres some real depth to the physics there SOMEWHERE. Cars feel speedy, have appropriate grip levels and behaviour becomes predictable and actually enjoyable. You can man handle them and slide them and really power through some of the super narrow courses (love that btw). The problem is it's hidden behind some god awful wheel force feedback.The tracks themselves vary from 'alright' to 'amazing' visually, in some cases some of the tracks look and feel actually more challenging than DIRT:Rally!Again however, you've got to look past the god awful FFB.Occassional issues with the loading bar completing but the game not advancing. It doesn't crash per say, it just doesn't finish loading either.Game seems to forget what the default controls setup should be too, not sure if its picking one based on what you press first (wheel, controller or keyboard) rather than what you selected last time in the options.Only major complaint I have is the audio. It's terrible all round. It's so frustrating, there is a potential fantastic game waiting to come out of this and I really hope Milestone make some real effort to provide post launch support for this. It deserves it and I'd really like to see them do something similar to what CM did whereby they got a experienced gamer/driver with knowledge of how the wheel should react to guide them on how to go about fixing the FFB.

												I don't get it why the uncountable negative reviews! I play Dirt Rally, love it. Now I play Sebastien Loeb Rally and I love it too. Ok, the driving is not as intensive in SLRE as in DR but hey, the physics and the handling is good, even better than in DR, the stages are varied, and there are so many cars to choose from. For me even the graphics is cool.The game runs smooth on my rig on high and with full details despite""Can I run it"" said no chance. My Logitech DFGT works fine and I have no stutter whatsoever yet.Undoubtedly it's Milestone's best rally game, maybe even better than Dirt Rally if you forgive it's graphics/effects and it's minor bugs. But if you are a rally sim fan you shouldn't hesitate on buying it. Sebastien Loeb Rally Evo is just as a ""must have game"" as Dirt Rally at the moment!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The DEMO should never have been released in that pre-alpha state.This full version is really good! Lots of cars to pick from, lots of stages to run. One of the best features is that you can run any car on any stage!  Pikes Peak is awesome and you can run a little 2wd Mini on it!  So far the handling is good and I am enjoying it. I have very little complaints other than I have to run V-sync or I will get tearing on the screen.  So FPS is 60-75Hz, depending on the resolution.Sounds are good in 3rd person mode, but everyone will complain when hearing them inside the car in first person view, but in real life you have  that helmet on and it really does sound muffled and weird.Fun game!

												Don't get the negativity. Sure, it's not as pretty nor is the driving model as realistic as Dirt, but it's a very accessible fun rally game. I've been playing Rally games since the 90's and this is currently my favorite. Dirt is simply too brutal. Here, I get my Forza style rewinds so I don't waste 8 min of my day because of one mistake. Offers me everything I want - a simple, easy to play joy ride through various environments. If you like Dirt 2/3, WRC4/5 at all, you'll adore this.			",99,9,23,0,8,3,5

												Great game. Physics are very good and simulate real driving really well. Pro's+Good graphics and textures (If you use SweetFX as the game to me is blurry without)+Awesome feel in the driving+Very very nice rally tracks to race on+User friendly interfaces+lots of carsCon's-Not sure if any mod tools exist. (would be great to create more tracks or cars)-The sounds could be a little better (add gravel noises or somthing)-Needing multiple device support as currently only one device works at a time.All in all I would really recommend this title to any racing fan and is worth every penny imo.

												It's a great game if you don't expect a hardcore sim out of it. It's a fantastic simcade title with an amazing variety of cars. I definitely recommend it.Pros:- Car variety. Plenty of cars and tons that aren't normally in rally games (Peugeot 504? BMW 2002? Delta 8V instead of HF Integrale? Hell yeah)- Tracks are fast, long and narrow- Weather and night time races- Driving feels rather nice (again, if you go into it EXPECTING what it is)- Dashboard camera view- Very nice environment detailCons:- Daytime/weather aren't dynamic but pre-baked- Chase cam and interior view are a bit weird, dashcam is great though- Crashes are very forgiving- Cars look a bit inconsistent compared to environments but nothing majorOverall I'd give it an 8.5/10. It feels like a real labour of love with tons of effort put into it, but it's clear that it isn't a huge budget game and that shows in some cases. Definitely an enjoyable game and will last a long time, though.			",121,3,36,10,16,0,7

												Before I purhased the game I tried the FEEE DEMO under ""DOWNLOAD DEMO"".  Obviously a lot of the negative reviewers didnt do this. Anyway I liked what I saw and tried  the demo so I purchased the full game.  Milestone have put a huge effort into this SIM. Its the best they have done.  Its way up there with the top Rally SIMS.  The physics are spot on as are the graphics and the attention to detail is quite amazing and when driving you get a real sense of being in the car.  I dont use any assists and I love the way you have to counter steer to right the car on corners etc.  THe car feels like its in contact with the road and you feel all the changes through a steering wheel.  I recommend it.  Its worth the money in my opinion. But sont take my word for it and try the DEMO first.  Have a nice day.			",297,36,49,12,29,3,26

												This game is great and has it place next to the other rally games out there. It has a nice driving model, good ForceFeedback. The tracks are great, the Career mode is varied, nice content to keep you busy. It is much better than expected, and much better than the demo.Don't trust the negative reviews, as currently all of them (except one from RacingIvysaur) are from people with a playtime less than 2h. This game is a lot of fun! ",20,7,9,0,0,0,1

												I have to confess to being pleasantly surprised by this game.  When it first came out I tried the demo, which I found utterly awful. A year on I had heard they had put a lot of effort into cleaning it up so when the sale came up as I love these type of games decided to give it a go.  Wow am I ever glad I did as I am having a blast already in just a crappy Peugeot 106. It is not perfect by a long stretch but can you have a lot of fun with it - absolutely.  And as everyone says there is a TON of content in this unlike Dirt Rally. Technically I am sure that Dirt Rallly is far superior but from the point of view of accessibility and replayability there are a LOT of things to like about this game. Still not sure I would have paid the almost $100 asking price at launch but for $20 there is a lot of entertainment here and I'd be suprised if you were disappointed. If you like racing games and like a challenge but are not a hard core sim fan this definitely deserves your attention!			",178,10,17,31,25,1,96

												well worth a look, some epic stages, really good handling model if your using a wheel(dont know about game pad) good graphics for the most part, good solid career modeits got its bugs, and you can bet your a $$ milestone wont fix it or update the content which is a shamemake sure you cycle your view at the start of every stage or the audio is messed up ;)stages are as good as dirt rally, there are some naff ones mind, excellent selection of cars, 'different' stages in every country,........ audio is for the most part rubbish, but certain cars (celica gt4 delta s4) sound epic. and the tarmac is sublime to drive on, better than anything else remotely rally relatedits got its bugs but cheap as fuuuuuuuuuuuq, buy me now ha			",24,4,11,0,14,0,0

												Negative reviews are being too harsh on this game, I found it to be a perfect blend of simcade. Performance was also good, didn't really find it that bad as others reviewers are making it to be, I paid $8 and it's easily obtainable at this price if you look around. There is a lot of cars to choose from and the way the career is structured is very well done. The Loeb experience area was cool, Loeb himself voices his rally experience as you progress through.

												Misled by the reviews, I held out to try this one out. Turns out it's pretty good, at least in present form.Pros:Lots of content, many terrain types, time of the day.Typical race types: Rally, Rally Cross, Pikes peakCareer mode, buying cars and tuning themLivery, team colors, names and even plateNice physics, car bounce and tumbles feel good even in an accident.Nice dirt in windshield and carWheel support works, it didn't take much to get it there.Wheel feels great, nice road grip feedbackCons:Can't choose cars in quick race outside of what you own in Career. This is bad for party gaming.Damage is very simple graphically (on/off), head on crashes look very unrealistic, as the car just stops with mild damage.Gamepad racing feels terribleSeveral tmes during each stage, there's a hiccup. I believe it's loading the scenery ahead, but whatever it is it's noticeable (with an SSD!) and takes you out of the zone,Meh:Can't pick the stage or number of stages for a rally: it's either the first stage or all of itNo VR supportSupports only one controller device at a time: no multi-device racing!Graphics are passable, but no HDR, looks vastly inferior to Dirt.Sound is passable. Inmersion is not great, but does the job.Force feedback on crashes is nonexistantConclusion: not as bad as reviews would led you to believe, but not awesome at all. A decent game, with more content than Dirt but of inferior quality.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have been using this game some now - and like it. No it´s not perfect, but neither is Dirt Rally, or Assetto Corsa, both of which I own.Realism? Come on... I am not a real world race driver, nor rally driver. I am in these games to be entertained - and, SLRE does that just fine. Only thing that bothers me, is that I cannot exit the game. When I do, it still is listed as ""Running"" and I cannot start another game, or even close Steam, because SLRE is running. I have to go to tast manager and find it there and kill it. PLEASE fix that.But part from that, I am plenty entertained by this Rally game.12. February review update:Now I have 22 hours in the SLRE, and I am enjoying myself more than ever. I see a LOT of people complaining, that have ½, or 1 or 2 hours in it (but also some who have a lot more, I admit) but please give it a little effort before raving it down. Seems like a lot of folks made their minds up about it, long before trying it out. That´s s pity I think.But never mind them - I think the game is great - I cannot say else, because I seem to choose this game over both WCR4, WCR5, Dirt Rally and the likes... (and see my game list, I have them all) SLRE looks great and feels even greater. I am going to enjoy this a lot more, thats for sure.			",42,20,51,9,18,1,0

												Very realistic game. The wide choice of cars and various routes is provided to the player. Besides there is an interesting system of purchase and an upgrade of rare and unusual rally cars that also very much pleases. There is also a wish to note magnificent graphics in game in particular very competent work with shadows at solar lighting. Routes aren't limited to borders or artificial obstacles and it is possible to depart with ease to a ditch that gives to game realism and adds a highlight to game. The system of damage of the car is also excellent. Game is excellently balanced and deserves the highest assessment!Очень реалистичная игра.Игроку предоставляеться большой выбор автомобилей и разнообразных трасс.Кроме того присутствует интересная система покупки и апгрейда раритетных и необычных раллийных автомобилей,что также очень радует.Хочеться также отметить великолепную графику в игре в особенности очень грамотная работа с тенями при солнечном освещении. Трассы не ограничены бордюрами или искуственными препятствиями и можно с лёгкостью улететь в кювет, что придаёт игре реализм и добавляет в игру изюминку.Система повреждения автомобиля также превосходна.Игра превосходно сбалансирована и заслуживает наивысшую оценку!

YouTube™ Video: Sébastien Loeb Rally Evo (Stutter Fix, No Input Lag) - PC Master Race Reality Check 

			Views: 4,190		

			Subscribe to our channel: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=AvaVII Michael takes over his wheel and goes BERSERK on an input lag, stuttering, frame lock, performance analysis and...		

Script: Sebastien Loeb Rally Evo is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥on the PC. You can see us playing it here, like this, and this, and here like this and even like this. And most of the time we had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ experience with it. The effort that went into the development of the pc version must have been close to none. But we found some settings, that worked for us in the end. Time for a PC Master Race Reality Check.In order to keep input lag as minimal as possible and unlock the framerate, we usually don’t play games with v-sync enabled. Unfortunately Sebastien Loeb Rally Evo becomes a visual mess as soon as players don’t sync their frames. Constant stuttering, lockups, frame drops and spikes get in the way of controlling the cars. As you can see in the footage: the game is almost unplayable like this. It’s such a mess.So we thought, okay let’s try to enable v-sync and cut frames at 60 then, but guess what? The game continues to stutter regularly. We were facing frustrating circumstances.Next we tried out the PS4 version with the first patch being installed. We wanted to know which sweetspot developer Milestone chose for the console. After recording and analyzing some footage and noticing some minor input lag we concluded, that the PS4 version ran at 30 frames per second with v-sync enabled. Along the way we encountered some minor frame drops during replays and races at night as well as other technical issues like fading objects at the side of the road and missing sound effects. But after all: the PS4 version was at least working and fun to play. From what we hear the Xbox One version has way more framerate problems. For our testing we were limited to the PC and the PS4 though.So we went back to the pc port, opened up the barebones graphical options for the game and set the sync to half. On 60Hz displays this option limits the framerate to 30 and voila: We reconstructed a Playstation-like experience on our PC. At least the game was starting to be playable. The stuttering was gone completely, but we were still unhappy with the input lag, that naturally occurs by enabling V-Sync. Here you can see the PC version with and without V-Sync side by side. The in game wheel movement matches our inputs 1:1 without V-Sync.As a last resort we gave FreeSync a shot and finally prevailed. The inputs are not as good as they could be without any syncing, but as you can see: the input lag is minimal and our Eizo monitor did a good job keeping the jumping framerate in check. Like this we definitely preferred the slightly better looking pc version over the console version.Apart from getting the game working in a playable fashion we also have some other bad news: Triple monitor setups or Ultrawide resolutions are not supported at all. Playing the game in 4K on the other hand is possible, but it takes a heavy toll on your  framerates. Even on our high end build featuring a Geforce GTX 980 Ti we went as high as 1440p for the maximum resolution. Our racing wheel, the Thrustmaster T500 RS was detected and worked well. It has to be noted that playing SL Rally Evo with a wheel additionally reduces input lag, because players can turn the wheel as fast as they want to. Playing with the pad, the turning animation of the virtual driver has to be finished first.And that’s it. We put a lot of research and work into this episode, because the game underneath the technical mess is by far the best Milestone has produced to date. We enjoy the driving, the track layouts, the campaign and many different parts of the game. But as it stands we at least have to put up a huge warning sign for this game. Depending on your hardware with the 30fps lock, FreeSync or GSync the PC Master Race still enjoys the best version of the game in the end.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Most reviews I've read of this game painted a pretty grave picture of how bad of a game this is. Well, coming from Dirt Rally, a great rally game in it's own right, I was certainly skeptical going into this one. The demo didn't really work well with my control setup and I wasn't stoked on the menu system and having to exit the race to adjust your controls. The narrator has a funny voice. I guess the american language version of the game isn't quite up to the english version, but sometimes you get random voiceovers glitching in so you can hear what you're missing every once in a while. Setting up the controls is a huge pain, because there is no support for multiple inputs. Meaning, you can't have a separate USB handbrake work at the same time as your wheel. My TH8A shifter works with my Thrustmaster wheel and T3PA pedals, thank goodness, but it really is a setback not being able to use my handbrake and button panel. Having said that, once you DO get your controls set up as best as you can, the game is a lot of fun. There is lots of fun in unlocking things and earning money in the game to graduate through the world championships or whatever this game calls it. ALSO, going through Seb's carreer is also pretty cool.  Though the framerate can be bad and there are a bunch of funny glitches (random navigator language change mid race, lol) It's really a lot of fun. Especially the RallyCross section, which I think actually does better than dirt, though the lack of a guy in your ear is sort of a letdown. TL;DR: Not Dirt Rally, but a fun almost-sim in it's own right. This game has the best rallycross of all of the rally games I've played. If you get it on sale, it can be a fun time.

												I thought it was gonna disappoint because it's developed by Milestone. But their work seems to pay off with the physics, car content and stage lengths. The only drawback with this game is the damage model (how the car behaves to crashing) the sound and not many countries listed in the game BUT they do have a decent length of track for the countries that they do contain in the game. Asides from that it's pretty damn good. Even the physics			",23,2,20,1,1,0,0

												As an driving simulator it's brilliant. Cars behave like those should. It's 10 years ahead of Dirt Rally. There is enough content to play.But, polishing is normal for Milestone company. This should be beta, not release. Sounds are about the same as those was 20 years ago. Pace notes are good, but co-driver says everything 5 seconds too late for fast cars. Damage model is quite worse. Better than DR.I voted to yes to this title becouse it's first game where driving model is in same level with RBR.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As of April 8 2017 this game STILL DOES NOT SUPPORT WHEELS.  It seems the company has posted FAKE pinned comments about the game being updated to support different wheels but this is a LIE.  Unable to change a single control the game does not see any button, pedel or wheel movement. What is even worse is the DEMO works just great with my Logitech G29 PC but once I buy the full game and all the DLC I find that the same control updates do NOT seem to be in the product being sold.  Very much seems like a SCAM...... refund requested.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played pretty much every rally game there has been in the last 15 years. This is by far the worst, in looks and performance. I mean when you release a game that has a direct rival in DiRT Rally, you have to make something better than this surely, it could compete against CMR2004 maybe but thats from 12 years ago and is still probably better. Worst £30 I have ever spent on a game.			",54,2,14,0,5,0,4

Car details more better then DIRT Rally, physics are very interesting and tons of cars. Stages are really nice. So detailed!But u need to understand game is looks more like beta, Bugs, fails - here it is. Overall i think game is good as rally sim. Depend on me exp in real life (Celica ST185), RBR and DIRT rally i think it good. Really good, just need more time and patches. Hope mil's dont give up on this game and SL Rally EVO will shine.

												I bought this game knowing full well what i'm signing up for - a Milestone title (says it all, really).I was prepared to spend 1.5 hours on setup, and if the game didn't satisfy me, i was going to get a refund.Luckily, SLRE works for me. I'm using DFGT (stock pedals), MSI GeForce 960, and i had to use a combination of tapdancing with VSync settings and Riva Tuner to get the game to work without lagging and glitches. This is the most fiddly game i've ever had displeasure of dealing with.If you can't get it to work after 1 hour, refund it. Refund it now, while you still can.However, if it works, underneath it all, it's actually a good game. Sure, it has its gameplay issues (lack of wheel centering has cost me A LOT of grief; race start is VERY weird, almost feels like cars are jumpstarted; etc. etc.), graphics are mediocre at best and at times have a very distinct PS2 feel, but the raw driving experience is actually on par with, if not better than, DiRT: Rally, and this has loads more content. AI seems spotty (one race it has you fighting for your life, another you can win easily), but competent enough for a n00b like myself.TL;DR get it when on sale (i got it for 8 EUR), be ready to refund it if it doesn't work within an hour.

												Let's be realistic.  For the size of the developer this game is great!  It's best played with three monitors and My Fanatec gear works flawlessly.  I don't like the fact that it can't support my handbrake but I work around it by assigning my sequential shifter as the handbrake and use paddles for shifts.  Adding this feature would drastically help immersion of the game and improve its status to a true sim.  There are three simple reasons to get this game:1. Amazing tarmac feel and rally stages2. Best weight feel of the car out of any rally sim3. Weight transfer feel when braking.  You actually have to slow down when approaching a corner, unlike other rally sims, and not because you are sliding, but because you can feel the weight of the car either causing a slide or shifting the car out of balance.  This is very unique to this game and has helped my driving in other sims as a result.I used to be all for Richard Burns rally, but I would rate this game second to Dirt Rally, and RBR third.

												Trying to write a honest review. How does one recommend a game that has great playing huge content hidden behind a wall of showstopping, hardly fixable tech screwups? SLRE is *that* kind of a title.So the game has a slew of great looking and driving, various rather long super stages (dawn/dusk/noon/night) and some nice hillclimb / rallycross stages. Sound FX is mediocre at best. Graphics is ok for 2017. There are many well modeled customizable cars with nice realistic handling qualities. Career is well thought through and there is a lot of player freedom of what and where you want to play.Now take all those features and contradict them with lack of wheel support, ghosttown multiplayer, crazy fps dips in some areas, not being able to reassign control keys at all, no force feedback at all and having to tinker with the video settings just to get the game to play smoothly on whichever hardware.If you can`t be bothered with any of the above issues then don`t even try. There is no troubleshooting help.I`ve gone through that wall only because I did not want to give up on the rest of the game. After 6 hours of trial and error bulls__t I finally got the graphics and my T150 FFB wheel working with SLRE.  Still no ffb though. And halleluyah, the game plays great and is better than its main competition in some respects. After 15 hours of sheer rally fun I`m still hooked and I didn`t even reach the best part of the sp career yet.I absolutely hated the tinkering. Fixed most of it, loving the game. Now make no mistake, this is IMO the best of Milestone since WRC2. It`s probably my main rally title now.Buy it *only* if you are able to fix the problems yourself. If not, just forget this game even existed in the first place. ",68,15,14,10,3,1,6

												If you can get it for cheap it is absolutely necessary to play the Loeb Experience.Best story in a rally game ever! Seeing the interview with Sebastien Loeb and after that completing the most important races in his career is a must for every rally fan. The career mode is also nice and suits me very good for 1h of playing a day. I have many races to choose from and I can start whatever race I feel like. The physics gave me a nice feeling while playing with the keyboard. The car seemed to respond correctly and I could anticipate every move.Cars are very nice to drive and they all feel different. I found myself enjoying very much FWD cars and I am still learning to control the Renault Alpine (RWD and rear engine).The locations are very well made and I enjoy them all. Tarmac feels the best!Now on the other hand:I have played the game early after the release and it was really unplayable on the GTX 960M. It was stuttering and frustrating, but now all of these have changed. I can run it smoothly at 60 fps most of the time and it's immersive.If they had delayed the release for making the game optimizations I think it could have had a better impact.The sounds are most of the time ok. They represent correctly the grip loss, acceleration, crashes and many more, but they are not pleasant to the ear. It feels like they are from the 90s. What the hell is that loud sound when I touch (hit) a decorative fence made of fabrics? It scares me every time! Buttom line: The story (Loeb Experience), cars, stages, physics and career are all great!Sounds and graphics are not so great.			",25,5,8,0,2,0,0

												Loeb shines in the typical, single-car rally mode.  The visuals are nice and the phyics are acceptable.  In fact, after playing this and Dirt Rally back-to-back, I'd say I even prefer this to Dirt Rally.  The courses are more visually interesting, and the on-track visuals are nice (though some textures in the backgroud could use some work).  Unfortunatley, there are races where multiple cars are on the track.  This is where Loeb fails, massively.  It hinders the experience so badly that I might delete this game and never go back to it.  AI drivers will consistently spin you, push you off the course, and stick to a line as if it's a demolition derby.  I restarted the last race three times and was knocked off the course each time, before finally just quitting.  Additionally, the car physics get really wonky--I witnessed an opponent tap the wall and subsequently flip on its side, cartoonishly, as if a Mack truck had smacked into it.  If you think you can push yourself through the miserable driver AI, there is a good rally experience to be had.  I would have left the rallycross races/elemination races/etc. out of the game altogether and just focused on the one-car rallying.			",10,3,3,10,2,0,3

												Good racing game with one of the best car physics. I think it has also the best racing line in rally games, showing when to speed up and slow down even on straights because of bumps and jumps. Can be compared with Dirt Rally and Richard Burns Rally.- Lots of content, many cars and events.- 70 cars to choose from.- 64 Rally Stages, 5 Rally cross tracks, 4 Pikes Peak (Different length).This game physics is so good that it forcing me to race from cockpit view so I can see the steering wheel, so I can react appropriate, feel and handle the car better and do not lose control of the car.- Replay camera could be better - no view from further distance like helicopter or cockpit view.- Detailed car setup options but no option to save it as a profile or something, so if you quit a race your car setup will be replaced by default everytime.- No option to disable damage. The problem is that windscreen get cracked very easily and hard to see much. Rewinding the time back does not help, windscreen stays cracked.- Multiplayer - sadly nobody is playing. Have to register on separate website to play multi.- No speed meter indicator outside or even inside the car. (except maybe 1 car pikes peak).- No option to save a replay.- In Time Trial you can race against other players ghost cars from the leaderboad. Ghost car should be more transparent because when its in front it covers the view too much.- Don't play this game on keyboard. Gamepad or steering wheel is must have.- Good tip: Switch off car stability assists in difficulty to see how good simulation is this game. With stability car feels stiff and like a brick. Can also switch off breaking assist.My Videos from the game: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkbhCoao7C-Fv54kQBqU9_dP-W0s4sfTIMaybe the best most detailed review is here https://pretendracecars.net/2016/01/31/the-only-review-of-sebastien-loeb-rally-evo-you-need-to-read/ ",121,8,3,13,7,0,27

												Looking at the game from a sim-racer's point of view:I tried again the other day to get to grips with this game......only to come away saddened, that I did not.Mostly this has to do with the horrible implementation of input-controls.This is clearly a title built around consoles and their gamepad-devices. With my wheel-setup (T300 Ferrari Integral edition + TH8A shifter), setting things up is an excercise in frustration to begin with. UI is horrible and does not give any visual feedback for the different input axxis, so figuring out what the associated modulators do is a pain.It does get worse on track: The built-in steering-damping(!) goes directly against the promised analogue control you should get with your expensive toy-wheel. Really Milestone? Brake-axxis seems to behave more like a button than an actual braking-system, default weighting prefers sending more stopping-power to the back wheels (which is just short of stupid on a RWD or AWD car). Now who thought that to be a good idea?There are some promising aspects of the game, for as little content that I actually ""suffered through"" trying to make this work: Some rally-stages seem to have a half-way decent length to them. And they look pretty nice all-round (in terms of flow and difficulty), resembling real-world backroads and gravel-tracks very closely.Just a shame that the way this game-engine was implemented, it does not allow me to truly evaluate them nor the handling-model without getting seriously frustrated.Graphics-wise, this seems a bit ""dated"" in the shiny-department - although that one coast-line stage in Wales really had some nice and believable lighting to it, looked really proper.Sound: no contest when comparing to the direct competition. Dirt Rally sounds like a small universe ahead of this.So all-in-all: for realism-seeking wheel-users I would advice to stay clear for now. This is just too frustratingMaybe for the intermediate pad-user (without a current-gen gaming console) this might a worthwhile console-port. Otherwise I have been told the PS4-version might enjoy a better implementation than seen on PC/Steam.Personally, I cannot - and will not - hide my disappointment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(In shortly, Physics such as Richard Burns Rally, but  I'm NOT Recommand any old Steering Wheel gamer whom is computing NOOBs. Want fewer pain? Read their steering wheels compatible list first)Game design was Okay. Physics level is such as Richard Burns Rally.This more need careful on traction during exit.Is a good standard character game to explain Loeb himself and stage design is need driver have better mind for space processing to read. If you feel Dirt Rally have too open space, this is good for complex Structure But some bad point on cars setting and evolution.Car setting has no any measure no idea where the setting is.And all cars are already full performance, may good for busy guy headache fewerHowever, this game has serious issue by Steering Wheel Support.This let me leave a bad comment.I'm using Logitech Driving Force Pro, the wheel since 13 year ago.I understand this is not in compatible List.However, this wheel running...Gran Turismo 4-5-6, GTR 1-2, Colin McRae Rally 3-04 - DiRT, 1-2-3, DiRT Rally, Richard Burns Rally, Projects CARS, Assetto Corsa NOWADAYS!Also USE for development my company contents (I’m work in Simulation Center for Racing Team).In serious, the Game Engine is possible to support my Wheel!To make this support my wheels, this took me 3 Hours to understand how to extract the files, analyze the trouble, solve the issues, keep file size as slim as original as possible during repack the achieve.This needed us to modify the Core Achieve from the game.But, this would really sucks for multiplayer by possible cheat issues!If I don’t do this, this unable to assign any input to game.Update: This support my wheel now.A minor Flexible design would help Anything.A minor Damn design would ruin Everything.

												What ever you do, do not buy this game if you are looking for a sim-racing game !!! i spent 5 hours downloading 24gb to play it for 30 min, delete it and request a refund while i could have played dirt rally/pcars/asseto corsa/ any other game.why i say you shouldent but this game:1. Physics : the physics in this game are awful non realistic at all i mean ""need for speed underground 2"" had better physics then this game.2. Preformance : i have a gtx 960 ssc 4gb ram, 16gb ram, 8 core 4.7 Ghz CPU and this game runs at less then 45-57 fps on low. for reference this is my fps in other Sim-Racing  games (all on ultra settings 1920X1080) Project cars : 90-130 fps / dirt rally : 75 - 110 fps/ asseto corsa 110+ fps.im telling you as a software engineer, a 15 year old kid that only has basic knowledge in c# and doesnt know math or physics can program this game better !3. Graphics : what you see in the screenshots is not what you see in game the graphics are aweful i dont know what graphic engine they are using (directx or opengl) but they clearly dont know how to use it ... you can follow a tut on youtube and get better results graphic wise. 4. Gameplay : First thing that you see when you go into the game is that you can do a quick race/carrer etc.. im going to go over only quick race since if that is not done well then its only down hill from here, if you want to do a quick race you can do one. but where is the catch ?? on wait here it is you can only drive 6 cars, but wait that cant be possible what is going on ... so you go to the second menu which you can see all the cars but inorder to ride a good car that sounds like a freaking overclocked refrigerator, then you need to spend all your time doing the carrer mode in order to unlock a superclock refrigerator sounding car.5. 24 GB????? : why ??? what is in the game that it reminds me of the time call of duty added fish and one dog to there game and suddenly its 500 petabytes6. this game is not worth your time or money go spend it on a good racing game like dirt rally or project cars ",23,1,7,0,4,0,1

												Im a keyboard playing kind of a guy, but still expericence the same as most others. Very slow steering, often you can hardly turn the car.Not much feel in the car, even with ABS etc of, th peugeot 106 wont overbrake/lock up, The cars feels mostly like its a plate running on a fairly flat surface.Graphics are quite nice, there seems to be a lot of cars to choose from, and a really nice feature at least on quick race you can ""rent the faster cars"". try the peugeot 205 mi16, pretty fast car, but also shows that the car handling concept is not ok in its current state.You normaly dont really feelt the car skiding or any thing similar.Oh and the sound is actually very odd. It seems they have some pretty nice recordings and then ""fixed"" them up... aka put them in a can far away.  Sounds more like an vacumcleaner at times. Other than that is has what can be expected many views from the car, many options to do a lot of settings on the car. I have yet to explore if you can upgrade the car and more importantly if you can feel the changes when in the car.Oh... you can get very much stuck in the woods if you understeer of the road... i got stuck between a couple of trees and no apparent way out...couldn't sideways slide the car free and reverse was the same...In my world this is actually more of a arcade game than a sim at present.

But is a very good rally game..The good of the game is the flexibility who makes it from a total sim game to an arcade game so only for than i vote yes, but if the problems doen't resovles quick then i get it to no, i don't suggest the game. For now i suggest it cause it has only two days of the officialy released so problems like that I write up may has a new game.			",188,12,20,13,5,4,4

												Well, I am glad I bought this game in the sale. Only poor reviews put me off buying it sooner (at a higher price). But I think those writing poor reviews must be using toytown hard-drives or have not re-booted their PC in a while or something, as the game ran great for me on my 3-year-old GTX780 (3Gb GPU) Haswell i7 rig (with 16Gb Ram).I did put the game on a PROPER Gaming Hard-Drive though (a WD Black [6Tb]).Windows 10 is on an SSD and is updated and re-booted.It also ran great in the more demanding Stereoscopic 3D, and I did not have to lower the settings. All on Medium/High.Happy bunny. Just need to get better on XBox One controller.P.S.It also ran great on my HAswell i5 AMD R9 280 Crossfire rig with similar specs.No problems whatsoever.I will connect my FFB Wheel onto that sometime soon to have some proper racing.

												Currently it is fashionable to say that Codemasters make good rally games, everyone else does not. Well, I've never been accused of being fashionable. Yes, Dirt Rally is a good game but in my opinion this is better.First up, I can't comment on the physics as I have never driven a rally car - lets just say that one feel as good or as bad as the other to me. Also, I am not one of these sim drivers who beats the game on it's hardest setting by 30 seconds every stage - I tend to play at medium difficulty and that is hard enough for me.I really like the stage selection in SLRE, they feel much more real than Dirt and there is a better selection on offer here.The damage is, if you'll pardon the pun, a bit hit and miss. I have finished stages with punctures & damage - while at the same time you can hit a wall or fall off a bridge with little or no apparent damage.Bottom line is that since installing I have not been back to Dirt, this is providing my rally fix.

												Sébastien Loeb Rally EVO is easily my favourite from the recent Rally games (SLRE, DR, WRC5).Some customers seem to have technical issues, but for me everything was fine out of the box.Smooth 1080p/60fps with vsync (ingame or adaptive), Xbox One controller, Thrustmaster TX wheel, it all worked right away.The physics need a bit of getting used to, but it`s a very good sim, very different from the more arcade style Rally games Milestone did before this one. It`s not easy though, you need to handle countersteering, weightshifting, be careful on the gas.Graphics are good, sound is ok-ish, but you can find better. SLRE shines in physics, content, a well made career and general presentation.			",100,12,27,6,6,0,5

												I literally cannot review this game, because by the time the game has loaded the main menu I've given up on it.I've apparently spent a whole hour trying to play this game, and in all that time all I've done is seen the main menu once. Account for about 5 minutes spent customizing a player and team that I'll never ♥♥♥♥ing use, that's 55 minutes spent waiting for something that shouldn't even take a hundredth of that time.On top of that, to close the game I've had to turn my whole PC off, since Task Manager can't even close it fully, rather leaving it to just cause periodic lag that lasts for about a minute across the whole computer, further demonstrating what a cancer this game is.The demo somehow worked better than the original game, but it's still appalling. Never ever buy this game.EDIT: oh yeah, forgot to say: buy DiRT Rally. It's probably cheaper and insanely more rewarding, because Codemasters actually know what they're doing.			",20,1,8,6,10,3,5

												Decent physics but not worth it due extremely lacking and broken controller binding.Pros+Handling+Stages long enoughCons-Lacking ffb or even sound feedback from the tires-Supports one device at a time, keyboard counts as one of them and is default, so every time I start the game I need to go options and cycle to the right device tab, otherwise the wheel wont work.-Always defaults to brake balance being way too rear and too sensitive, waste even more time in menus every time.-Can't rebind pause key!!11one!!1 I don't even have that button physically on the wheel anymore(G27 custom rim). Combine this with the fact that the keyboard doesn't work in game if you want to use the wheel, I literally can't even pause the game.-Microstuttering and random freezesSo my gameplay experience in a nutshell:1. Spin or some♥♥♥♥♥♥due to no feedback or a freeze, will not admit it's my driving skills...2. Kill the game because can't pause. Sure I could use rewind if I wanted to be lame3.

												I cannot master the handling of the cars in this game.  It's like driving on ice.  I'd rather play DiRT Rally.  This game is tooooooo much like a sim.  So much that it isn't even fun to play.  Braking puts your car into a straight line only which is of course ultra realistic but the braking distance is looooong.  Tap the e-brake ever so slightly to go around sharp corners and you spin out into a tree or ditch every time no matter what speed you are going.  There is no way to fine tune the game settings to make this game enjoyable.  I love dirt rally racing but I'd rather go play Raceroom or Asetto Corsa or Project Cars than this game.

												75% off, why the hell not? Because its a bad game, thats why. I played 2 hours, and have requested a refund. The game has poor audio, even worse physics, and appalling optimization. The way that the game procedurally re-renders the environment as you get closer to something slows down the game and resulted in me having to turn down the graphics from medium to low (on the recommended GPU, the GTX 960) in order to even have 60fps for a majority of my playtime. The audio is garbage, it uses fmod, but not the way fmod should be used. The cars all sound very similar, and when I take my headphones off and switch to 5.1 surround, it gets worse. The co-driver's voice comes from the subwoofer, and very muffled so I can't even hear him, and the pops from the engine come straight out of the front speakers (and much louder than when you are accelerating too). WHY? You could have at least gotten the audio right!As far as the physics and gameplay, no way. The car's handling is extremely twitchy (I have been using an Xbox 360 controller, as I don't have a wheel setup) and I can barely keep it under control. The sense of speed is terrible, at best, motion blur is pointless as you never seem to be going fast enough to even notice it. The spedometer in 3rd person mode is of a poor design and I, personally, don't like its appearance. The gearbox when shifting is very unresponsive a lot of the time, getting a good launch or getting into reverse when I screw up is hard since the game has so much input lag. Even the terrain of the rally stages has so much lack of design and input, the surfaces all seem smooth, unlike if you were to drive these stages in real life. Developers like Turn10 (Forza devs) actually go to the locations they add in their games and make sure that almost everything is perfect (how else are the puddles in FM6 and FM6:Apex pretty accurate), and their graphics and audio are actually good. I've heard Dirt Rally is good, I'll probably try that at some point, but this game has a poor representation of rally racing and puts shame to such an awe inspiring sport. If you have any sanity, don't buy this game, do yourself a favor.			",41,5,8,3,12,0,6

												I don't recommend for keyboard players. Even after getting keyboard to work at all, the ""R"" key to reset your car when you get stuck doesn't work. So if you get your car stuck, but not so far off track that you get auto-reset, you can't do anything but quit the event.The first time I booted up the game it invited me to play a tutorial. I accepted. But in the tutorial no key on the keyboard did anything (I tried them all), no way to bring up a menu, could only Alt+F4. Turns out you need to not do that tutorial, and first go into control options and ""reset"" the keyboard controls. Even though they already come set to some defaults, they don't actually work right away (and don't even match what you get when you ""reset"" them). WtfAnd you do have to ""reset"" the controls, not just set your own controls. Because in the test drive mode there is a prompt like ""press D to start a time trial,"" and this D key will not work if you set your own keyboard controls without actually doing a ""reset"" of the controls first.Aside from that the game looks nice and seemed promising. Wish car damage felt more satisfying/realistic			",53,0,5,3,1,0,5

												ok so the graphics are not too bad but not amazing and there is very little controll over them.the steering is terrible. you try and correct yourself and the car skits all over the place.yay it has xbox controll auto in so thats a slight plus.all in all not too bad but the steering needs sorting its hard to play with it being so terrible.

												I had High Hopes for this game to be a simulation that could beat the original Richard Burns Rally and try to compete with the most excellent Dirt Rally which sets the benchmark to date!All starts well with initial excllent front end graphics and visuals but thats where its good with lots of options etc. So you start with one car, well there are a few cars to rent but no instant action mode to try out a lot of the cars is missing - very sad.So onto the real problems Milestones last outing WRC4 had dream handling you could have loads of fun driving those cars!Sebastien Loeb EVO Rallys Driving Model is awful back to the days of a car sitting on a central pivet point floating across the track like your driving on Mars! The tracks are also just a little too narrow except the Pike Peak Track which the Drive model actually suits. It means you spend a vast amount of time off the track as the cars spin around too easily. I urge you to try the PC Demo first as you need to try this before you buy. Not a long term play!Only for the die hard fans who play every rally game to its end. 5 out of 10 Good Scenery and tracks bad handling! Dirt Rally You are the King Long Live the King!

												If you're a fan of Rally racing games, I cannot recommend SLRE highly enough.The car physics and handling are superb, the car roster is very impressive, the number of stages and the stage design itself (all based off of real-world counterparts) is fantastic.The visuals, while a little rough - look rather good. The cars are modeled well and the stages are a fair representation of their locations, with plenty of detail.On the audio side of things, the game doesn't quite hit the mark - the Co-driver is competent enough and delivers the pace-notes admirably, but the engine sounds and other effects aren't the greatest.The amount of content in the single-player portion of the game is immense and offers dozens of hours of play-time, with a large and well conceived career mode being the main focus.Again, I can't recommend this game highly enough - it really is a brilliant rally game.Milestone should be proud of what they've achieved here and SLRE deserves to be recognised as the fantastic game it is.

												So, being quick and short winded - Game is much better than the negative reviews suggest IMHO. I play mostly racing games. Have TM TX wheel. Steering is good to very good - Do people even adjust wheel settings? FFB is pretty good (I'm very picky) Physics are good to very good. Some complain about input lag. I play on a good Desktop and alittle ""lesser"" laptop. NO input lag on desktop but have some on laptop. However i do on other games as well when using laptop - I have a long HDMI into TV.There are a few minor bugs as per most new games, but game has been very stable from day 1Desktop - GTX 670, 6 core AMD 16 gig ram Win 7Laptop - GTX 675m, I7, 12 gigs ram			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok, so I have 30 minutes of playtime. What right do I have to review the game from that, you might think.I do not have 30 minutes of playtime. I have had 30 minutes of trying to get the game to work properly, before I gave up.Everything seems top notch, from what I've read and seen from the game. I like the graphics style better than competing rally titles, the sounds are actually good, the stages are varied, narrow and realistic, the car selection is awesome, it has some small, but nice costumisation options, the career mode is extensive and interesting. Just to name some of the good things about this game.The car handling and physics I cannot say much about, because I'm not able to actually play the game the way it's meant. But from what I can tell, it actually feels much better than Milestone's last effort, WRC4, and it might very well hit the sweet spot between harsh realism and forgiving arcade-style driving. But I wouldn't know for sure, because it has too many game breaking bugs.I really wanted to like this game, because it has so much good going for it. But it is unplayable:-Graphics options are a joke, and it's impossible to configure the game to run smoothly without having to disable all the three(!) quality options available, on a system that runs most games at 60 fps on high settings.-Configuring custom controllers is a nightmare. Want to have multiple controllers or external shifter? Forget it. Want to map some functions to your keyboard? No can do. And my G27 is stuck at 180 degrees no matter what I do. It works in all other games, but not this.-The menu actually stopped responding a couple of times (in 30 minutes!) and I had to kill the game from task manager.-The game has no FOV or seat adjustment sliders, neither does it have the option to remove the steering wheel from cockpit view. Triple screen support I don't know, because I have only a single screen.If Milestone can present a game that actually works, this could be one of the best rally games ever. But in its current state, it's mostly unplayable. If you've been told that the demo doesn't do the game justice, it actually does - the full version is just as bad.I'm getting a refund.But I'll gladly buy the game back if Milestone can make it work.
