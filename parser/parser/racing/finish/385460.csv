												It's bad.  This game is more than just poor quality, it also is pretty much broken.  So here is a rundown of my experience.- In the startup launcher, every resolution option was duplicated 10 times at least.  Like, 1920x1080x32 is listed 10 times, same with 1680x1050x32, and so on.  Strange.- No controller support...  I know it does not imply to have any controller support on the store page, but it is a huge setback for the experience requiring the user to use the keyboard.- No mentioning or list anywhere within the game of what the controls even are.  You have to play with it for a few minutes to figure out how to move your racer.  Spoiler: you go forward with ""w"" and you steer with the left and right arrow keys.- No options menu AT ALL.  There is a space in the menu for where it COULD go one day, but yeah, there's no options menu in this game.  - Only options are quick races and career mode.  First I tried career mode...  It seems to function, you go through the races and if you get first place you can continue to the next race.  If you fail, you have to restart that race.  There's no indication of what progress you have in your career, just that at first you will be one dirt track and on the next race it's a different track.  You get to choose a rider model, but when you race, it will not be the model you chose!  Brilliant!- When you create your ""career"", you enter your name.  But when you finish the race, it instead displays ""aaaaaa"" as your name.   - The game has weird quirks to it, like if you are headed down a straight away and you go 1 inch outside the course (still headed in the right direction, maybe just cutting the corner ever-so-slightly. a big ""WRONG WAY"" is displayed on the screen.  - Sometimes the computer's AI will need to respawn back onto the track, and they might just spawn right on top of your head, and you can keep racing with them on top of you.- When you ""restart a race"" because you didn't make first place, you might break the game.  As in, there are no textures, and you are racing in a black world which is impossible to see what you are doing.  I did race 1, got 1st place, race 2, failed, restarted, and then got to no-texture-world on that next attempt.  - Even on a high end system, the rain seemed to break the game.  I went from a super high framerate to almost unplayable when the rain started.- When ""restarting a race"", the game did not load, basically crashed.  I waited 10 minutes, nothing happened, had to alt+F4 to get out. - Frustrated with career mode, I then chose the quick race mode.  I did one race.  I stayed exactly on the track.  I was far, far ahead of everyone else.  After 5-6 minutes, I noticed that I was in last place.  And I was still on my first lap.  Just for fun, I kept playing and playing, enjoying myself at the fact that it was not triggering +1 laps every time I crossed the finish line.  I went on to do 3 more laps, and still was on lap 1.  - If you get stuck, you cannot ""reset your ATV"" back onto the track.  There is no button on the keyboard to do this, nor if you hit 'escape' can you expect a 'reset your ATV' option.  You have to exit the race, or restart it from the beginning.  Should I keep playing or is this enough reasons to not recommend the game?  Oh yeah, I forgot one more thing:In quick race mode, there is a big button (when choosing your ATV) that says MODIFY.  As in, modify your ATV... but it does nothing.  I assume it's a placeholder button.  Okay I'm done.  Don't buy this game!  :)I'll add in a compliment: there seemed to be quite a bit of variety in the quick race mode level selector.  The tracks themselves are done fairly well and is around a dozen of them.

			Hey I sat down and gave this ATV GP game a real chance here and I think it failed me. It's really horribly broken.
