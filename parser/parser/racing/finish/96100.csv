												Defy Gravity is a platformer with a simple concept:  Get from point A to point B by creating attraction/repulsion areas.  The game is simple but fun, and provides a good challenge during the second half of the game.  It can be tricky but the checkpoints are placed in such a way that you're willing to take risks and try new ideas to get past some obstacle - a very important attribute for puzzle games.The only thing that is sub par is the animation (or lack of).  It isn't really needed, but the game has the GameMaker feel, a bunch of sprites just moving around the screen with a short walking animation, which I find kind of off putting.  It isn't important, but it should be mentioned.If you like physics manipulation games or platformers, then I recommend buying this.  The game is $3 at the time of this writing, more than worth it.

												It's hard not to recommend this, given that I made a 7 cent profit from buying the game then selling the cards... getting paid to play a game is never wrong. :-)But even ignoring that, I had a surprisingly good time with it. Defy Gravity is your basic puzzle platformer where you have to use an unusual mechanic to navigate levels. In this case, you can shoot gravity fields that attract you or repel you and activate a shield that lets you ignore all gravity fields. By mixing these, you can sort of rocket-jump-grapple-hook your way through levels. Some timed jumping and obstacles that sometimes are and sometimes are not affected by the gravity are there to stop your progress.In the words of a wise man, you're going to die. A lot. The game takes delight in throwing stuff in your way at just the wrong moment. But at the same time, it's surprisingly forgiving with how you swing around the level and you can often brute force your way through tight spots. ""Hectic"" is not a word you usually associate with puzzlers, but Defy Gravity can get pretty hectic -- and that's when it's arguably at its most fun. For me it hits just the right balance between frustration and challenge.The graphics and sound are absolutely nothing special, but in terms of pure gameplay, this is value for money even when it's not 90% off. When it is, of course, it's a no-brainer, just get it. :-) ",136,36,1,17,7,2,27

												I just bought it for cards admittedly (at $0.29), but I actually found it rather fun to play instead of just idling. The game is short so I have to say only buy it on a major sale, but well worth the time if these kind of games interest you.Gameplay wise it is a fun platformer, and does remind me a bit of Portal. It isn't an exact copy though, instead of Portals, you manipulate Gravity to repel and attract yourself and other objects. The momentum and physics of the game is fun to toy with, though it CAN be frustrating at times. Checkpoints are placed in fair spots of most stages to reduce frustration, but later stages stretch this out quite a bit so you will have to keep on your toes or be prepared to die again and again.I did beat the main story but I decided to leave before continuing deep into hard mode. It takes away one of your powers and while I do feel that's an interesting challenge, I'm satisfied with just beating the main modes.			",339,69,13,39,21,4,31

OverviewDefy Gravity Extended is a small game, with only a few tricks, but does it very well. It lacks the flair of a quality game, but once you go in and try it, it certainly redeems itself. In this game, you play as a spacesuit wearing gravitymancer trying to pass the gauntlet. You are equipped with a gravity gun (not the HL type!) and have to traverse many levels to prove your worth!The Pros:Simple Concept - If you can make a simple game fun, you have succeeded as a developer. The game mechanics are very simple. You move about, and create two types of ""portals"". One that has a strong gravitational pull and one that repels objects. You can also activate a shield around you that negates any gravity effects. Leaving breaking the laws of physics aside, you must combine these simple actions in order to get yourself to the exit.Good Level Design - I'm not talking about the aesthetics, of course! I'm referring to the level layout, the challenges you face, their diversity, their difficulty. It impressed me how challenging this game became in later levels, without repeating itself throughout. The levels are many times relying on sinusoidal patterns and geometric arrays of projectiles!Challenging - The levels begin increasingly harder, and some are outright stressful. If you are looking for something to test your skill and patience with, you've come to the right place!Good Music - The background music is a nice relaxing tune that suits the space environment we are supposed to be in. Really helps ease out the stress from those hard levels.Cheap - The game is 0.99€ at normal price and can go all the way down to 0.09€ when on sale. So, just give it a try, it will cost you basically nothing. (Not to mention it has Steam Trading Cards)Achivements! - Few achievements, only requirement is passing the game. Sounds easy, huh? It's not, but good luck, hunters!The Cons:Ugly Visuals - The textures aren't eye candy and everything is flat and pixelated. While I'm not saying a game is good if it looks good, it wouldn't hurt getting a little face lift every now and then.Shabby Animations - The animations are barely existent, sometimes movement may seem plastic, especially the way your character tilts its body when looking at the cursor.Conclusion:Defy Gravity Extended is certainly not a game for everyone, so if you don't like skill-based platformers with minimal controls, then look elsewhere. If however, you like that sort of thing and still have the pocket change from grocery shopping, then consider giving it a go!If you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

However, a great difficulty awaits you because you have only the first gun in the hard mode.

												Defy Gravity (henceforth known as DG) is an example of what a small indie game should be.Gameplay:Based on two types of gravity spheres, one pushing you away and one pulling you towards it. Using these you have to traverse levels and bounce/throw yourself across pits. Overall the gameplay is simple, standard WASD and mouse, plus having support for a controller. Graphics&Sound:What are you expecting out of an indie game? The sound is above average, as the music is pretty nice. The graphics are typical, though not bad enough to be annoying. The one complaint i do have with this game is that your character looks as if he's using a Super Soaker rather than a gravity gun. The Good: I got this when it was on sale for $.14 (yes, 14/100) and it was a nice, cheap pickup. It'll provide a good amount of fun.The Bad: The controls are a bit wonky and some of the levels require split-second reactions.Overall Grade: C+ Not Bad, but it's a small game, good to play if you got a few minutes to kill.

Fun gameplay for about 15 minutes2.) Alright music for a cheap indie game3.) Controller support (If you like that)4.) Really inexpensive alternative to the Portal franchiseCons:1.)

I haven't finished the game, as i'm stuck in stage 5, but with enough effort you can finish it and feel the joy of completing such a difficult task.I'd say this game is well worth the full price for its gameplay, soundtrack and challenge, but you may as well wait for a promotion, as the price goes down an insane amount (around 90%).

												Defy Gravity Extended it's an indie game based in physics / gravity laws. It could looks like a horrible game. I mean art and animations are simple and it can feels empty, otherwise it's too challenging. You can feel that it's a 2D version of ""Portal"", you have a gun that has two functions, repel and attract.Something that i loved in this game was the relaxing background music that makes you relax during stressful levels.It has enough good levels and after finish it the nightmare haven't finished yet, you have to complete it twice in order to get all achievements, something that will make you rage.It's always on discount (95% off i guess), so if your style it's the challenges you can give it a chance.7.5 / 10If you found this review helpful you can find out more at our Completing the Backlog's Curator page.

												Decent puzzle and platformer game that involves placing gravity and anti-gravity wells strategically across hazards and obstacles Kara must travel across to reach the exit in every stage. There are approximately 21 levels altogether, plus the same 21 levels for the real Gauntlet mode where Kara may only place gravity wells. Although some levels can be frustrating due to the random and unpredictable movement patterns of some of the hazards, the game is forgiving and has checkpoint locations to enable instant retries at each checkpoint location along various intervals in each level.

												This game was a lot of fun and very reminiscent of the early 2000s online flash games, which gave me a wonderful nostalgic feeling all throughout the game. This puzzle-platformer is straightforward, however reaching your end goal can and will be difficult. The simplicity and correct execution of this game's design creates that unique feeling, where the player knows finishing this level is solely due to the player’s ability to perform. No game exploits, no grinding to get to a certain level or luck driven events. Just simple, skill-based levels with original and adaptive gameplay.Granted that not everyone is into 2D flash puzzle-platformers, this game may not be what everyone is looking for, however if you do purchase this game and give it the time of day, I think you might be pleasantly surprised at how much fun you'll have.Extra - The authentic soundtrack is very atmospheric and enjoyable.

												Tough platforming game, but worth the cheap price you can find it at, or especially when it goes on sale you can easily find it for less than a buck.  The goal, to reach the end of each level offering a different level of difficulty with different obstacles.  The gimmick, a double jump ability and an anti-gravity/well-gravity gun.  Using both of these while stagnant is easy though tricky, but when you have to use them while on the run can prove quite difficult and at times frustrating.  The hard mode features only the well-gravity gun.  Beating this latter mentioned segment proved really difficult and a true test of the puzzle and platforming skills.  I did find a few odd issues.  At times the screen would go black when loading or reloading a level.  Shooting would fix the problem, however, if the level was saved at a save point, you may need to act quickly, shooting and eliminating your gravity shot then moving forward when given limited time only added to the difficulty and when it's unnecessary difficulty, it made it really bad.  The graphics are simple, the sound and music forgettable, but it's the gameplay that wins this game a recommendation.Overall though, I did appreciate the tests and found the game worthy of playing and I do recommend it for you if you can deal with proper frustration and sometimes improper and unnecessary frustrations.

												Defy Gravity Extended is a puzzle platformer game where you play as Kara, a gravitymancer. You will use a gun that places gravity wells and anti-gravity wells. You will use them often to solve various puzzles throughout the game. Gravity well pulls you into its center, while anti-gravity wells repels you from its center.Defy Gravity Extended has a very unique game mechanic, it is quite different than most puzzle platformer games I've played. The soundtrack for this game is very nice and relaxing too. You can get 100% achievements just by finishing the game. I like that the game doesn't make you finish a level in a particular time so you won't be pressured while playing. The game has 24 levels and certainly doesn't lack in challenge. There is also a checkpoint system in the game, so if you die, you won't start from the beginning which is nice.However, for me, it is more frustrating than It is to enjoy while playing this game. The controls are a little bit difficult. I don't like the animation. The game looks very unappealing to me. The game lacks on the options menu. You can't adjust the game's volume at all, so you will need to change it from Windows or your speaker. It also lacks in resolution options too. The game at one point crashes, but it wasn't in a middle of a level. The story is pretty much non-existent.In conclusion, Defy Gravity Extended is a unique and very challenging game. But it is very frustrating to play. I don't enjoy this game very much, maybe because this game isn't for me. The price seems a little fair though. But I do not recommend buying this full price since it goes on sale quite often. I do recommend purchasing this game on sale because it's usually on sale for 90% off or more.			",81,14,0,16,24,0,15

												This game was absolutely fantastic. It has an original concept, and good application. It was challenging, fun, infuriating at times, and immensely satisifying to complete. The storyline is relatively simple - as are the controls. You will almost always be able to understand how a level should be beat, but the application will still be somewhat challenging, and may require a few attempts. Once you've beaten the game, there is a secondary playthrough which removes one of your abilities, rendering the game a completely different approach - needing more planning and less random leaping about. It assumes you know how the mechanics work at that point, then puts your knowledge to the test. The game was a bit short, but well paced. I would happily buy the game again, and at it's current price, it is more than worthwhile, even just to test it out.			",98,9,0,16,2,2,4

												""Release Date: 18 Mar, 2016"" Fake release date. This game has been out for at least a year, maybe 2 even. The release date has changed simply so that the game will appear on the Steam store front. Very fishy action from this dev and this should not be alowed on Steam. The new release date is simply fake and false. I played it for 5 minutes and crashed 5 times by pressing W at the start point. Seems to be made with Unity (or Clickteam), but badly coded. I also looked al the reviews and most of them now show up a 'pre release' due to the fake release date. Not to mention that a lot of the reviews seems to be super positive with a 10 minute total play time, so I call those fake too. I can't really check how good/bad the game is ,because I crash every minute just by pressing a key. This game does not seem to be something to be super positive about.Edit: apparently the game was released on steam in 2011.			",148,11,15,23,22,1,29

♥♥♥♥ Gravity - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]Man has long yearned to fly among the stars. To be in space. The final frontier. There's all kinds of cool things up there, all of which could kill everyone on our planet in the blink of an eye. We could all just be a little flickering candle of a planet, snuffed out by the flap of a little space butterfly's wing. It's pretty cool.We've obviously never really been in space though, or on the moon. That's a conspiracy perpetuated by Richard Nixon and the Disney Channel. You don't want to believe the lies, but it makes people happy. Just like the tooth fairy or the concept of chivalry. You can believe whatever you like, but really all they want is to get in your mouth and leave some money on your nightstand.While humanity will probably never REALLY be in space, because space is actually also a conspiracy that Disney Channel likes to keep going for their ""special interests"", we can imagine what this fictitious place called outer space is like through video games. Yeah!According to the legends, people can float in space. There's a force that pulls things towards planets, but there's none of it in space. ""Gravity"", they call it. It's apparently what holds us onto Earth. Even though everyone knows that we're actually held to the Earth's surface by the natural paste on our feet and shoes. If you ever sprayed non-stick cooking spray on your feet, you'd float into the sun and die.But gravity makes for an interesting theoretical concept, and an even better game. Defy Gravity, which has also apparently been Extended, is a sweet little gem of a PC game you can get on Steam.Defy Gravity is a little budget puzzle platformer. Nothing too fancy. I probably bought it for a quarter. But definitely a quarter well-spent. It's short, sweet, fun, and surprisingly smart.There's a definite Portal vibe going on here, and it's at least mildly Metroid-inspired in some way. Your character controls gravity with their gun, which is capable of shooting two different colors to make pushy gravity and pully gravity. They also PLOT TWIST ARE GIRL WITH BOOBIES. GIRLS CAN PLAY GAMES TOO.WHEN HE TAKES HIS HELMET OFF AND HAS THE BOOBS SO YOU KNOW IT'S FEMINISM.DID YOU KNOW GIRLS CAN DO THINGS.Defy Gravity packs a lot of punch for a simple game. I can count the amount of stage hazards on my fingers. And yet the way they're combined is never dull. It's a short, compact game. There's not a super bountiful amount of content. But for what you're paying for, they squeeze every little drop of game out of it.Most puzzle games need to be this huge♥♥♥♥♥Rube Goldberg type of thing. There's so many things everywhere, and you need to remember all these different elements that interact with one another in all these ways. And when all of that combines, you can pop a balloon or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ Defy Gravity has like, a brick and some lemons. One lemon has a nail wedged into it. There's a dog. And yet they manage to pop the ♥♥♥♥ out of so many balloons. There's some really memorable levels with only those elements. It's humble, and it's simple. But it's smart, it's fun, and it's well-worth the quarter I spent on it.It's a budget title for sure. Everything seems to follow the basic theme of ""Not amazing, but for a quarter this is pretty nice"". It's not meant to be the biggest, most impressive game you can buy. Graphically, it's incredibly simplistic. It almost looks like it was done in Flash or something. The sprites are decent, but everything is very basic looking. The graphics work though. They're unimpressive, but they're not ugly. It has a nice look to it, the sprites are well made, and the general art direction and style works.Its game design and mechanics are its biggest selling point. It's not even particularly long. It's pretty short actually. But it's a brutal platformer later in the game, so it can definitely take you a few hours to complete with the excellently done difficulty ramp considered. And if you're a sucker for brutal puzzle-platforming, the extra Hard mode post-game is enough to frustrate most platformer fans.There was clearly some love put into the game. It's well-designed and has a nice coat of polish. Cheap polish, yeah. Not the name brand polish that all the super models use. More like store brand Kmart polish. It'll get the job done. Might even look nice. They'll never know, probably. Your mother-in-law will be able to tell, and she'll gossip about it to everyone just to spite you. You ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥. But no one else will notice otherwise.It's a nice game. It's pretty nice. Better than most things you'd buy on Steam for the price. It's like the difference between putting your quarter in a fancy machine with flashy lights and junk, and giving your quarter to a homeless heroin addict. You want to pay for the nice machine, not only to reward yourself with the gumball but to reward the nice people that took the time to build this nice machine. You don't want to flip a quarter to a guy that's gonna save up to shoot himself up with heroin, break into your house and♥♥♥♥♥♥your guinea pig or your sister or something. Think of the guinea pigs.

PresentationDefy Gravity follows a similar road with some other platformers we've seen lately, using space as a foundation for the game, as you take control of one of the Gravitymancers who came to the Gauntlet, the ultimate test, in order to prove themselves. However, where other platformers with a similar pattern such as The Swapper manage to tell an interesting and unique story using the darkness and emptiness of space, Defy Gravity only introduces you to the Gauntlet, without actually telling you what it really is, what purpose does it serve and why would anyone risk their lives just to prove that they can get to the end. It is quite obvious that story isn't the main focus here, but even so it's hard not to notice the missed opportunity, since The Gauntlet itself could've been filled with messages from others who tried and were defeated by The Gauntlet or pretty much anything at all to justify your desire to finish it; instead you're left with a left to right Mario-style platformer without any princess at the end.Rating: 4GameplayThe gameplay is based around the use of gravity wells, which can be created using your gun, in addition to the ones that are already placed on the map and cannot be moved; using those wells properly and learning how they influence other objects is key in Defy Gravity, as almost every puzzle is based on how well you manage to use the gravity wells depending on position, as well as timing. There are two types of gravity wells: positive and negative; the positive wells will attract objects towards them, including yourself, while the negative ones will repel them, and combining those wells with your anti-gravity shield that makes you immune to all wells is what makes the gameplay unique and interesting. The whole concept does wear out by the end of the game, as there won't be any new ideas introduced into the game later on, leaving you mostly with more bouncing objects to avoid in order to make the game harder, something that does happen once you finish the game and Hard mode is unlocked, disabling negative gravity wells and changing a few things in each level in order to make it more challenging.Rating: 8.5GraphicsThe first thing you will probably notice are the backgrounds, which look amazing and change from level to level, but what on the other hand, the levels themselves are designed using the same monotone, gray blocks and the only thing that differentiates them one from another is the layout of those gray blocks and the bouncing objects between them. The visual effects are basic and nothing stands out, mostly because no beam or ray of light can move your eyes away from the galaxies in the background.Rating: 5AudioThe tunes are okay, but since there is no story or momentum to what is happening, this is probably one of those titles you'll play with your own music in the background. The sound effects feel absent most times, as they are either too quiet or not in total sync with the action, but then again you probably won't need those anyway.Rating: 4.5ExtrasFor its 3€ price tag, Defy Gravity offers enough to justify the purchase, even if you can finish the game in less than two hours, adding 2-3 more hours to that time if you're down for the Hard mode, but if you are looking for anything extra, there is nothing more to the game than the adventure itself.Rating: 7VerdictDefy Gravity is an okay platformer if you only care about the gameplay, as it does introduce a new concept even if it only lasts for a short time, but for anything else you might expect from this game, you will probably be disappointed.Rating Overall: 5.8Check out the full review and a lot more about Defy Gravity at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=366 ",141,34,2,13,6,2,7

Defy Gravity Extended is a very nice and short game that will satisfy anyone who has had enough of mindless shootings. The biggest asset is obviously the freedom to choose while solving puzzles and a feeling that the laws of physics are at our mercy. The graphics and music are perfectly matched. Everything is in its place and a pleasure for both the eye and the ear. So take a gun in hand and ... go right? Yes. It's just a simple, small, modest low-budget minigame.			",270,47,11,25,15,1,25

Gameplay'Defy Gravity' is a platformer that uses physics (gravity). It has the usual jump-or-die and dodge-or-die mechanics, but you can also create two kinds of wells: a gravity well that pulls you and certain objects towards it an anti-gravity well that repels you and certain objects away from itAdd to that the option to switch on a body shield, which renders you immune to all gravity and anti-gravity effects, and you have some nice mechanics to play with.DifficultyI'm not a big fan of the platformer genre because I find standard platformers too 'twitchy' for my taste. But occasionally, I wil try a platformer game that has some special mechanics like the wells in 'Defy Gravity'. So you need to read the rest of this section knowing that I'm only a very casual platformer gamer.I have to admit I liked 'Defy Gravity' and I had a lot of fun until the 'Grandmaster levels'. Judging from the Steam Achievements, that's almost halfway through the game. At that point, you get a warning screen letting you know that the game is kicking it up a notch and is about to get - and I quote: ""much more difficult"".I noticed in the first 'Grandmaster level' that the game was no longer my cup of tea because it got way too difficult and yes, too twitchy for me. But I suppose for hardcore platformer gamers, the fun would only just begin at that point. I would like to point out that all the footage seen in the demo video here on Steam is from pre-Grandmaster levels. I'm not saying that's a conspiracy on the makers' part or something like that, it's just so you know when looking at that footage and thinking to yourself 'that doesn't look too hard to me'.Graphics and soundThe graphics are ok. They are nothing special but certainly good enough for a game of its genre. I invite you to take a look at the video and the screen shots to judge for yourself.A lot of reviewers don't like the music. I can relate to that but personally, it didn't bother me and I have a low tolerance for annoying music and sounds. For the most part, I even thought the music was nice and at least fitting for the game. So it's clearly a matter of personal taste and let's leave it at that.There are no options whatsoever for graphics or sound. A word about the Steam extras'Defy Gravity' has 5 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 just for running the game.The Steam Achievements are uninspired. They are limited to your classic 'pass x number of levels and get an achievement'. If you just play through the 'easy' part of the game, you'll end up with 4/8 so a 50% completion rate.			",232,141,2,44,9,3,34

												Nailing that feeling of satisfaction when you’ve figured out a solution to the task at hand is very difficult. Not all mechanics allow it and not all games offer more than one route from point A to point B. I believe gravity manipulation and physics-based gameplay is one of the greatest things gaming has bothered exploring. When done well, it is logical, intuitive and rewarding. It’s like pulling out that second to last piece of Jenga.This is what Defy Gravity Extended is: an extremely satisfying game. You play as Kara, following the Samus school of power armour where you couldn’t tell the gender were it not for the game description. She has to prove herself as a Gravitymancer in the Gauntlet, using her sassy gravity gun (which looks a bit like a Super Soaker). The gun can set two kinds of fields: one that attracts and one that repels. This is the basic premise, and the levels are variations upon previously-set rules. You might encounter enemies who are also affected by the gravity fields, a level may turn your anti-gravity shield permanently on, or you’ll have to use platforms affected by your gravity gun as well.The graphics are really basic, and I admit I was a tad skeptical when I saw some screenshots, but after 5 minutes into the game all my doubts were washed away. The levels are very well-made and reward smart thinking. The first few stages give you hints where to place the respective gravity fields, but you will soon realize that you can use even less resources than recommended.The music is also really good. Now, I’m not a music reviewer and I lack the capacity to translate how music feels using words, but Defy Gravity’s soundtrack took me off-guard in a very pleasant way.The only complaint I can think of is a lack of level editor, which seems extremely appropriate for a game like this.

												You get an excellent puzzle platformer for this price. It mixes mechanics that are a bit similar to Portal's mechanics with Braid's platforming (or jumping, really). Of course the game has its own style and own mechanics, so don't expect a clone of the games I just mentioned. The graphics are extremely simple, but they get the job done. I absolutely love detailed, well animated 2D graphics, so I'm a little bit disappointed, but for this price, I guess I can't really complain. The gameplay is the most important factor here and I have absolutely no complaints about that. Controls work well, but take some time getting used to though. The game is also quite forgiving in parts where you die. It makes the game fun and removes the frustrating parts. But don't expect an easy game. It will still take some skill to finish it. Go for it ![Rating: 78/100]			",1657,631,69,221,194,16,225

												An interesting platformer that although it may feel a bit cheap, i enjoyed it. Here you have a gun that can create a gravity or anti-gravity field, and you must use that to go through the levels. One thing i liked is that the gun isn't always necessary to progress, making the level design feel more balanced. There's 24 levels, and after that you unlock the hard mode, but either way the game isn't too hard, just challenging a few times. The graphics and music weren't impressive, but they got the job done. One thing i didn't like was the lack of a level select screen: you can only start a new game or continue. But it's a decent game nonetheless, and for cheap is worth of your time.

												Hey! I know most of you already have this game, because it gets so damn cheap, considering the card prices, it even had effectively negative prices in the past.So, this review is not to make you buy this overlooked gem. It is to make you play it.First, who is the targeted audience here? If you liked, Rochard or Outland or any other puzzle platformer, you will feel like at home here. I know most of the reviewers really like using shortcut of, ""Yes, this is puzzle, and the most commonly loved puzzle game around is Portal, so I will just call this Portal in 2d AND space AND gravity guns rather than portal guns AND without an actual story AND heavily amateurish -or indie- AND with some minor bugs making controls a bit harder AND....As you can see if you say this game is similar to some other with some exceptions, but if number of these exceptions are more than 5, actually your so called similarity does not convey any information at all. So, I will just skip calling this ""2D PORTAL game"" even though I agree that it sounds catchy. It is not similar to that game. And btw, if the idea of 2d Portal sounds enticing to you, here is the original Portal game that started it all: http://armorgames.com/play/107/portal-the-flash-versionThis game is a puzzle game. You use a gravity gun whose stationary bullets move you towards it, and another one whose bullets repel you. You also have a shield, causing you not to be affected by those effects. You can just use once for each type, until your feet touches the ground. You use these mechanics, together with momentum to overcome some obstacles, reach some high places which is not obvious how to reach. Levels get progressively harder, introduces some enemies, some hazards, and new tools like free to move platforms, vanishing platforms etc to increase the complexity a bit.I really liked playing through it. The most used ""tactics"" is same for many puzzles, put an attractor, jump to it, put a repeller behind, cancel attractor then you are flying ahead.  Of course there are some others, and even using when to use that changes from puzzle to puzzle, and in the later levels, choosing where to put starting attractor also becomes a part of the question. But still, if this game was longer, it would be prone to become a chore. In current case, it introduces the mechanics, uses them all, tests whether you are really able to use all, and says farewell before giving you a chance to get bored.I have one minor and one more minor negative. First, minor one. Even though I can feel the effort put for attracting and repelling mechanisms, they dont work in a predetermined way. Sometimes you perfectly know what to do, still a milimetrical wrong placement of the ""bullet"" destroys your strategy. Not being able to assign moves from before hand, together with general difficulty of placement of ""bullet""s midfly, helps the feeling of glitchiness. I think there is no glitch here, only some calculations is not smoothed out. Really really really minor mistakes, even the ones that is not visible to the eye can cause to death.More minor one: In the last level, checkpoint placement sucks. I had to read through all of the Credits 50 times before finishing it. For the first 5 times, I thought ""Wow! Such a nice idea to implement credits here!"" Nearing the end, my thought was like this: ""These ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are stealing my precious seconds again.""If you can oversee some minor problems with games like these, you will enjoy the effort and thought put here. There is also an extra ""New Game+""like mode, supposedly taking the option of attractors out, but I did not try it, so I cant comment on it. From what I have played though, I know that you will enjoy ""Aha!"" moments, and succeeding ""Finally nailed it"" moments. Not expect a perfect platformer or a hardest puzzle ever though. It is mediocre at both of these.TLDR:=========================if indie_tolerance==0{ignore;end}if indie_tolerance>0 and puzzle_love>0 and platformer_love>0{if cheapskate>0{get;end}else{maybe;end}}			",930,220,17,111,80,9,185

												Very strategic game, makes you angry if you are impatient yet it gives you motivation and enhanced your problem-solving skills. Also this game is cheap, bought it for only 5.00pesos/$.09 .This game is worth buying. Try it, I know you won't regret it.			",8,5,0,1,0,0,0

												You know what, when a game cost 19p in the sale... you just gotta go get that game, and play it a wee bit.Basically buy it if you have 19p spare as it is suprisingly good game to spend a few hours on.			",123,25,0,9,24,0,39

												The ability to alter gravity in a platformer is nothing new, but using gravity wells to do so is a novel concept that I haven't really seen done- at least, not with player controlled wells. At 24 levels, Defy Gravity is pretty short, but...Despite only having 24 levels, this is one of the most frustrating games I've played in a while. To put it bluntly: the main mechanics don't work right. Sometimes the wells pull you in/push you away as they're supposed to, sometimes nothing happens. Often with the blue wells I found myself looping around the center and dying, simply because the game felt like it. The design of most of the levels, especially near the end demand near perfect control with this utterly broken mechanic.Oh, and your air jump replenishes weirdly, sometimes triggers on the ground (hello, death!), and cuts all horizontal momentum when you jump.Hard mode strips you of the anti-wells and the only way to get any reliability from the mechanics is to use both in conjunction.Literally the only upside to this game is you can buy it, turn around and sell the cards for more money than the game itself. I guess that it's short helps too, but really this is not worth the effort to play through.			",69,23,2,14,4,0,13
