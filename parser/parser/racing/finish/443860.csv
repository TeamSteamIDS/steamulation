												If you've never heard of Riptide, now is the perfect time to get on it.  Jet Moto?  Hydro Thunder?  Put them together.  Add some SSX flare.You get a crazy feeling of adrenaline and speed when you are chasing after the wake of the person ahead of you, so you can slingshot passed.If you already own Riptide GP 1 and GP2, there is plenty of enough reason to get Renegade.  More stunts.  I think it's FASTER.  More ALIVE.  And Deadlier.The 9 tracks are insane with so much going on.  (It's leaning more toward VectorUnit's action packed blockbuster racetracks of Hydro Thunder Hurricane.)It's gorgeous.  Lush and futuristic.  Apocalyptic in others.  There is one track that is in a storm and the waves are massive.The sound FX are amazing!As I'm skimming along the water on a crotch rocket, I keep saying to myself over n over, ""This is amazing.""Controller..   get one.  It's a racing game.  lol  The only people complaining about the game are the people who REFUSE to buy a controller.  For $13 it's a damn steal.THANK YOU VECTOR UNIT for this GEM.Now I hope to see you people online during peak hours.  (3PM to 9PM)  And I hope your ride is souped up, cause you will get DUSTED...  in the WATER, where dust doesn't even exist!!			",496,57,29,12,62,8,30

												Awesome! If you are a fan of the last Riptide GP, this is definitely an improvement. Better graphics, more fluid feel for steering. This absolutely has a better feel to it than the last game and the last game was great.Im usually hesitant when it comes to spending money on a game when it isn't in Steam Winter Sale time. I like to get my money's worth. I like knowing when I pay for a game, it is playable, it is fun to play and I wont just play it 1 time and never look at it again. This game is worth the $15 or whatever it is. No buyer's remorse. Great Success!Note: Any bad review given to this game about being bad or automatic when using a keyboard can't let you turn away from this game. Dont be a baby, buy a controller, use the controller when playing games like this = have an awesome experience!			",56,5,3,1,8,2,1

												Best described as a mix between Hydro Thunder and Wave Race 64 (as far as stunts are concerned, anyhow), Riptide GP: Renegade has a fairly long single player mode that includes a mix of race events, stunt contests, time trials, and elimination events, in addition to 8 player online events and 4 player splitscreen modes.There's also an excuse plot that serves as a way to explain how you end up unlocking new characters and vehicles (there's 9 characters and 9 vehicles total), and why you'll have to deal with police hydrojets (their term for the boat/bike things, not mine) chasing you every now and then. The only drawbacks I can think of at the moment is that the AI can be a tad ruthless at times, the music is fairly bland, and that playing with a gamepad is essential (although this goes for just about every racing game). Overall, if you enjoyed any of the previous games in the series, or any other arcade racing game involving boats, Riptide GP: Renegade is well worth its low asking price.			",149,18,29,31,20,1,16

												My daughter and I really enjoyed the 2nd game and were looking forward to this one. If you liked the last game you will like this one. There are a few changes but all in all it is more of the same in the best way possible. This is a very fun arcade racer. Don't buy it expecting realistic physics or a deep role playing experience. Expect fun, well thought out tracks and some really ""wow"" moments with much improved graphics.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												WOW!!! Hydrothunder for the N64 is one of my all time favorite games. But this is even better. The sense of speed, kicking soundtrack, sheer number of tracks and upgrades will keep you coming back for a long time. As a casual gamer who grew up in the arcade, this is a nice walk down memory lane. Considering its only a half of a CD worth of information, goes to show how there is so much bloatware out there. This is a lean mean racing game with amazing use of water and particle physics. I assume this is an android port, but actually feels like an XBox360 game. On a side note, depending on what controller you are using or keyboard and mouse, the game automatically senses it and started telling you to press <enter> or <A button>, very nice touch, theres nothing as annoying to me the game telling me to press <enter> when I'm using a controller or vice versa. Kudos to Vector Unit! Also it supports ultrawide, huge plus for people like me.			",814,195,33,60,28,3,43

												1st Impressions:  It's a fun, modern Jetmoto-FZero hybrid!If you like Riptide GP2 as myself, you will like this.  Nicer graphics, some shortcut routes and some more gameplay options.My main issue is lack of tracks, from what I saw and researched its only has 9 tracks with a few variations. Like Ride the motorcycle game, its good, but gets old racing the similar tracks with just a few small changes to the tracks and type of race (race, stunt points, elimination). It does have different event variations to keep it fresh. GP2 was better with tracks imo. Its has more of a sci-fi theme and is a nice arcade racer that focuses on stunts and boosts, same controls for stunts which are critical to winning, upgrades (a bit of grinding) and some vehicle customization options. Wish you didn't need to use the boost up all at once. Anyways, the price is reasonable, so I say its a buy if you want some fun Jetmoto style of racing.8/10			",314,64,48,19,11,3,23

												Very fun and intuitive racing game with a twist. This was my first foray into this series of games, and I was very pleasantly surprised with how quickly the controls became second nature. I like the fact that there's a mix of player skill, machine upgrade and unlockable bonuses and skills that contribute to winning races. You can go back and repeat races to earn either a better standing, or earn more experience and gold to unlock/upgrade more to give you an edge, or to simply learn new stunts and the courses better to stand you in good stead.So far, I'm very early on in the game, but I feel that it has rewarded me for the effort, is something I can play 30-60 mins at a time and pick up/put down whenever I want to, but still offers measurable progress during that time.

												I don't understand the negative reviewers just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on this game for trivial reasons.The cops provide little to no threat. If you're such a♥♥♥♥♥♥that you keep running into them, then you're doing it wrong.Once you buy a few lvl 5 and lvl 10 tricks, older levels will be much easier to beat.Bosses are difficult, but once you're used to the map they're fairly easy to beat.They're not ""INSANELY DIFFICULT"". Just difficult for starters, at the very least.The game is NOT impossible to play, NOR is it impossible to enjoy.The game is already BALANCED. If you 'need' the developers to make it easier for you, uninstall the game and get a refund.I should note, I just beat Pyta and Fryta fairly easily with my Scimitar hydrojet having no more than 1/2 the upgrades for it.

												Riptide GP: Renegade is phenomenal.As a massive fan of arcade racers, this series has been a shining light of the genre. It's mobile roots were evident in the first two games, but Renegade builds on what made the last two so great, and goes all out.Controls are perfect now. Not a single flaw. The Hydrojets are more nuanced, and the trick system is more forgiving, in the best way possible. You still need to know what kind of tricks to pull out and when, but landing them is a lot easier now - making them even more essential to racing.Graphics are great. Very pretty and colourful. It may lack some of the fancier effects of other modern racers, but for this kind of flawless performance, I'm more than willing to give up some mod-cons.Sound is as you'd expect from a Riptide game. Great music, satisfying effects, it all just screams pure 'arcade'.The fleshed out single player is great, a big improvement over GP 2. The storyline is ok for what it is, nothing special. But you don't play games like Riptide for the story.The only problem I have is that the game at certain points gimps you on purpose, to make the game harder. I've spent a fair amount of time grinding races for money - I don't really appreciate you giving me races where my hard earned upgrades don't count, with the time I'm putting in to make sure I CAN give myself an advantage over the competition. It smacks of unfair. I'm more than willing to grind racers to afford the upgrades I want, so don't punish me, the player, for playing, basically. It's not a dealbreaker (yet), so I'll let it slide for now. Everything else though is golden. I'm having so much fun just playing. The variety is there, the audio/visual presentation is excellent, and the controls are SUBLIME.Absolutely recommended.			",223,33,30,17,10,1,20

												Riptide GP was originally a mobile handheld game by Vector Unit. Now the series has found its third game to be here on Steam. And it's bloody fantastic. Pricing is on point, bunch of content to be enjoyed here and a decent variation of different customizable vehicles and riders. The difficulty here is also hard as balls, so DO EXPECT SOME CHALLENGE with this one.Mechanics are also pretty smooth and very simple, there aren't many buttons to be pressing so you'll definitely get the hang of the control scheme real quick.Visually, it looks amazing. The aesthetic isn't exactly unique or anything we've not seen before but it just looks GREAT.The characters, colours, backgrounds, maps, WATER, it all looks amazing. Especially for something that started off as a mobile title. You can do tricks with your water ride thingies but overall it's a pretty casual racing game that really reminds me of the SSX series. As you know none of those made it to PC or STEAM so if you're looking for something of that nature, this is definitely the game to be picking up.			",989,380,25,133,92,11,119

												A fun water racer with plenty of content and enjoyment to be had at its price point.The environments are well designed and the variety is just right, from a lush forest to a flooded post-apocalyptic city, the visuals are a great step up from the previous installment.Being an arcade racer, there is little story to the game, but if you follow along with the dialogue, it attempts to give each character their own personality, and for the most part it succeeds.There are a ton of tricks to unlock and master, you will need to remember which jumps allow you to perform the longer tricks, or when to just barely squeeze in a simple Can-Can for that optimal boost, I like that. It rewards you for skill and quick thinking in an otherwise difficult game.If you've enjoyed previous games in the series, or even other water racers from the past, don't hesitate to give this game a shot.

												I'm a Riptide GP 2 veteran here, so here are my two cents about this sequelI decided to change my opinion of this game as I put a little bit more hours into it. However I still mantaining my initial observations about it, the difference is that I would recommend it now instead of not recommending it, as I had it before. The game has all the annoyances of previous titles in the series, without having any of the fun things that made those previous games enjoyable. It's still a game about grinding so that you can buy a bike and upgrade it, but now the bike gets nerfed down when entering races bellow the stage in which you acquired that bike. What the actual f$%k were these people thinking. However, there are plenty of events to keep you ocupied, that will tend to put you on the same tracks over and over again. The color palette on some races is super crappy, so you will find yourself racing in cities where the water is grey, the buildings are grey, the sky is grey, and the obstacles that knock you down from your bike are ALSO grey. There are three difficulties in the game, easy, medium, and hard. Hard is unbeatable, and the other two make you feel unaccomplished, effectively making the game pointless. I don't think I have ever been so angry with a game, and to further exacerbate this, I was (still am) totally hooked with GP2. Riptide GP2, this game's predecessor is a much more simple game, but orders of magnitude more fun to play.  I still believe that most of the flaws in this game can be corrected with a simple patch though. So there is hope for this game still. The bikes are the coolest of all of the series, lookwise that is. And some minor story elements have been added to the game, so now you gain riders as well as bikes as you progress, each coming with their own mini story arcs that leads to exclusive races, open only to those riders. This would have been amazing if they would have put a little bit more effort into the monologs of these characters, as well as their stories in general. But the stories are so dumb, and the riders are so poorly writen, that you can't really appreciate any of them. Awesome idea, just poorly exceuted.			",174,16,8,18,11,0,22

												At first launch, it seems a bit like a buggy port from a console or phone/tablet. The tutorial starts by saying that you need to chase another racer, and that it will auto accelerate. Cue me sitting there waiting for it to start moving. Turns out, auto accelerate is disabled by default. Cue me trying to press W to get the jetski to move. No effect. Space. No effect. Up arrow. *Starts moving*. Groan - bad default keyboard map. Changing the keys is a harrowing experience too - reminds me of some dodgy old games circa 1995. And you can't use the mouse to move the viewport or boost either - strictly a keyboard affair and the automatic camera mode. Plus, until you restart the race, it gives the wrong hints for what keys to press... It even suggested that I ""tilt my device"" to turn at one point - er, pretty sure there is no accelerometer in any part of my computer...I've played the previous Riptide games, so I figure I can try boosting and doing tricks in the tutorial - no go. Turns out they don't become active until you start playing for real, at which point you kinda get infotips showing you how to use them anyway... So, my advice is just skip the tutorial completely. Whether or not you have played the previous games, you are not missing anything except a bit of story...Apart from that, graphics are pretty gorgeous, race tracks have hints about turns and stunt areas, at least to start with (I haven't seen an option to turn them off for a more authentic experience - I do know how to look at the mini-map, you know!). Will play some more and see how it goes...			",605,188,42,88,114,7,142

												I have played Riptide before but I must say this one I like the best, it offers many options during career mode, such as competition,freestyle, time trials and so on.  The base game offers other things such as co-op with your friends, or you can play online if you have no friends.lol.  The GFX are pretty good, they are Nintendoesque, and the GFX are probably as good as the games on the Wii U.  It automatically senses your Graphics card capability, so no fussing around with settings.  I have an Nvidia 1070 GTX so I could play on Ultra settings, they look fantastic on my 4K monitor.  It's not the greatest and most perfect game, and not a huge amount of tracks but the graphics look great, the music is suitable for the gameplay, and it's just a lot of fun to play either career, co-op or online.  I would definitely recommend this game, especially the price point $16.99 you actually get the best bang for your buck if your into this genre.  I give it 2 thumbs up!  Thanks to all the devs that created it.  :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dev finally fixed keyboard controls. It's an ok game, but if water is not your top priority, check Redout instead.The racing is cool so far, the boosting is faster than GP2 but the normal speeds are similar. The handling however feels much better.The transforming vehicles are very neat but in career and challenge mode not all are sidegrades, only the last half of the vehicles seem to be. In quick race, multiplayer and split screen you can pretty much choose any of the vehicles as their base stats are determined by the speed setting chosen beforehand.Where this one shines is in the track designs, it has all sorts of crazy post apocalyptic or utopian ones, there's also warzones and mid city tracks and even an amusement park. Some of the tracks change layout slightly from lap to lap due to scripted events, like doors opening, something blowing up or ""hacking"" the route.There's a story very similar to NFS:Most Wanted if you are into that.It's still a glorified mobile game.

												Riptide GP continues its Journey to become a little bit more Hydro Thunder with each Sequel.Now we have a mix of lap races and A-B point races (which more racing games need cause LONG A-B races are a best), with far more Hydro Thunder style set pieces happening, Such as a track turning into a battle zone with what look to be Pirate ships attacking. Great. Tracks also now have mutiple routes that can open up during a race, and hidden shortcuts to find.Hot laps are gone, replaced now with Slalom races, which anyone who has played Wave Race 64 would be familiar with, its also kind of akin to the Ring challenges in Hydro Thunder Hurricane (though I prefered those personally)Controls and general feel of the game is improved over the previous game, Feeling less like a game designed for Mobile and more like a proper racing game for proper games devices. The previous games very much felt like all the corners were just design for full speed and full turning to accomodate less control fidelity. Now they seem a little more varied.That said, the game still retains some of its Mobile origins, with 3 star ratings per event (whats wrong with just 1st, 2nd, 3rd/Gold, Silver, Brozne, whys it gotta be stars?) and a difficulty curve that seems to be based on the usual mobile approach of come back later when you have better stuff.Ai is competent, whilst it doesnt take shortcuts and apparently lacks rubberbanding its aggresive enough to keep up via stunts and boosting.Options wise the game lacks any real configurability, opting to just have a few pre-sets to pick from and then an option to change the rendering resolution. This could really do to be expanded so we can actually confgure individual aspects of the visuals, as it is theres currently no way to turn off the motion blur when boosting and that sucks (cause I'm playing on a toaster and it doesnt like it, no sir.)In closing, Riptide GP: Renegade is a great improvement over the past iterations and well worth picking up for anyone who is a fan of Arcade racing games in the vein of Hydro Thunder or Wave Race.

												The only jetski game where you can race during a WAR.10/10, would get blown up again.			",105,8,7,13,8,0,6

												I'm only just getting into the game but it's really fun so far! It controls well and Vector Unit's expertise with water-based racing games really shows.			",211,54,4,16,19,5,27

												This game comes down to one thing: The difficulty.If you enjoy a challenge and don't mind repeating the same levels over and over and over just because you messed up one turn then this is the game for you. Also the difficulty ramp up is insane, I went from winning every race to not even being able get top 3 within the first handful of missions.If you'd rather have a casual game that slowly ramps up in diffilcutly then I have to say look elsewhere.Until the devs add a difficulty setting, I can't recommend this game. This isn't Dark Souls and most people won't have the interest to master this game, so unless you're one of those people you'll find a lot more aggravation from Riptide GP: Renegade than any actual fun.

												The tracks are nice to look at (kind of like a 3DS Max demo reel from early 2000s).  The vehicles are more difficult to control, but I suspect with practice I'll get better.  What doesn't make sense is the other racers are insanely difficult to defeat and you can no longer buy new bikes! You have to defeat the insanely difficult opponents to get a new bike. It's impossible and not at all fun.  I even changed the level down to easy and they were still impossible to beat.  And it isn't like I suck at playing these games. I was quie good at Riptide GP. The newer surroundings are okay, I suppose, and the ""story"" is just sort of stupid. But the addition of police, I thought, would be welcome and might even be an equalizer in the game... except the cops only seem interested in you and no other racers. They seem to be there to get in your way (and ONLY your way) so you can't win. And that's it.  Considering the fun they could have had with adding police into the mix this seems like a huge opportunit missed. The devs took a very well balanced game (Riptide GP2) and made it practically impossible to play, and impossible to enjoy. I hope later updates fix these issues. At the very least, this game really needs to be balanced out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is FANTASTIC, however, it doesn't recognize my Logitech Rumblepad 2.  :(  That's a HUGE downfall.  Change that, and this review would be a LOT better.			",7,0,2,0,0,0,0

												Not much better than it's predecessor. Shouldn't racing games be about your control of your vehicle? These devs still haven't worked it out and racing on water can't hide their poor programming. It would not be so bad if there was some consistency but the hydrojet sometimes has a mind of it's own, either braking too hard or too late, and the steering is wonky sometimes. Surely it can't be the Xbox controller.			",106,29,20,2,4,2,6

												Quick arcade-style fun. Love it. Not complicated, not annoying. Worth a try if you like that kind of stuff!			",419,72,13,46,56,5,42
