												I did get some very odd effects ""prism"" on the screen in the first race and even the garage ""pause"" screen, I changed some settings and looking at the recording they went away for the second race. (not sure what did the trick though)Looking at the game (as in just reading what it is; car combat) I did think it'd be a whole lot more ""arcady"" in its handling but I was pleasently surprisded with that, the handling in the game's quite good, easily on par with something like NFS Underground and those. (and a lot better than the newest NFS)The handling/driving did remind me a bit of the Flatout's in that it is a bit on the drifting side but if you focus on driving rather than smashing into opponents you can outrun them through the handling of the car, by driving better. (I'd see myself have a blast with this online with weapons being disabled just pure racing, it is that good...)The ""Arnold"" and those commentaries do get old very fast, enable each of them for one race and then turn them off, they're fun there and then but not in the long run.In the end I have to say (as I'm not really big on vehicular combat games) I'm having a whole lot more fun with this than I expected and I don't regret getting this one bit.

			COMPETITION ENDED! This game is available on Steam right here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/596620 My Thoughts: This is the original Gas Guzzler game prior to the 'Extreme' version.		

My Thoughts:This is the original Gas Guzzler game prior to the 'Extreme' version. It's been brought to Steam as you cannot get it anywhere else anymore. I have to say for an older title it handles brilliantly and runs super smooth. Also as a credit to the developers it doesn't look out of place in todays 2017 gaming market. I also remember the game struggling on my OLd PC at the time of its initial release... but no longer. If you're looking for a combat racing game, look no further.Game Details:Gas Guzzlers: Combat Carnage is a fast-paced addictive combat racing game for the PC. The game features many different vehicles, weapons, upgrades, on-track bonuses as well as distinctive and astonishing environments.			",1016,195,27,62,74,1,89

												This game is kind of a 3D Death Rally (the original one, not the remake). You start with a crappy car and climb your way up the ladder, upgrading your ride as you get cash from races. You have cars mounted with weapons, and mario-kart style powerups (with a serious tone, no throwing turtle shells here) that litter the road... along with a lot of destructible obstacles. You can either outrace your opponents or destroy them.The racing and the shooting feels rather good, but I would've appreciated a slightly more realistic physics model: as it is driving on sand, grass and asphalt feel almost the same. Track design is good so far with a lot of shortcuts, jumps and choices between the fastest lane or picking up a powerup.Graphics are nice overall with special mention to explosions and particle effects: the road littered with burning wrecks is quite a sight as well as being a challenge to navigate.So, recommended for the single-player, and I think it must be very fun in multi. Not sure about the longevity of the game due to the rather low skill ceiling though: getting those curves right was more of a challenge in the old top-down Death Rally from what I remember.

												I picked this up for 5 bucks and have been playing for a while now.  It could be so much better than it is.  The ""challenge"" seems to come from worse and worse car control as the game progresses.  Seriously, it's less about your opponents than it is just trying to keep your car from bouncing all over like a pinball.  It totally detracts from the game and makes progress a real chore.  The upgrades to your car are pretty much pointless because you'll spend your time wondering why you keep randomly veering off the road and going the opposite direction that you're pressing on the controller.  The harder you try to fight to go back onto the track, the more you get pinballed around and bounced further away by logs, rocks, snow, and just bad car physics.The battle races are also pretty much pointless.  It sounds fun on paper, but in practice it's just sorta ""meh"".  See, the object is still to come in first place, not take out the other racers.  So while it would be fun to be able to just devote your time to attacking your opponents, you can't.  The guns aren't that strong and there are gobs of repair powerups scattered all over the place.  So if you devote your time to combat, you find that you fall further back in the pack as your weak guns don't really do much damage and they'll just run over a repair powerup anyway.  Ironically the best races are the ones with no guns involved, simply called ""classic races"".For $5 it's worth the price, but I wouldn't pay anything more for it.  If I could some up this game in two words it would be: Unrealized potential.			",4,1,0,1,2,0,0
