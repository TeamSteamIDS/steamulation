												I bought this game back in 2007 with a fancy TrackMania t-shirt for 33 bucks. I spent thousands of hours, building new tracks, driving thousands of tracks, hunting for new records, making in- and outros for my tracks, having nice conversations with probably the best community ever.Now, about 8 years later, I bought this game for 30 bucks again, just to have it on steam.TrackMania is and will always be the best game in history.

												An unfortunately often overlooked game that has an extreme amount of respect from it's players but not a shred of acknowledgement from the rest of the world.I don't think this game got any hype at all, really. Which is a damn shame, seeing as how much hours people have put into this and the fact that the community of veterans has somehow managed to stay alive and well after all of these years.I got the original Trackmania (The original) game out of a cereal box. And if I didn't, I bet I would have never touched the series. Out of sheer awe from the quality of the game, I bought Trackmania: Sunrise Xtreme off of Ebay years later. And now, I found that there was a steam version of the game, Trackmania: United Forever, which luckily enough, is a full-functioning combination of everything in the Original TM and Sunrise Xtreme TM into one super-game with content updated for both games and new content for both to officially mash the two together on an updated playfield.For people new to the series, Trackmania is mostly a racing game. HOWEVER. You build your own tracks with the exact same advanced freedom the developers had when they made the standard tracks The races are non-contact and are purely for who can get the best time A lot of the game is directed towards break-neck stunts and mile-long jumps that require extreme precision to complete flawlessly The game has multiplayer that is cleverly designed to have the players race together but remove the effects of lag, competition and griefing by simply using non-contact 'ghost' style races and stunt events As a map builder you can concentrate just as much on making the map beautiful and realistic as well as concentrate on somehow making a single ramp send the player from one end of the map to the otherWhile being a game with a lot of features for multiplayer, the game definitely accomodates for the offline community as well. And being that the races are a 'ghost' style event, you don't have to worry about poor AI opponents or finding other people to play with as the people's races on the same course are recorded to be your 'ghost' opponent. In fact, you can turn off the 'ghost' opponent entirely and just race against your own time if that's how you want to go.The only time I ever have a problem with the game's community is when I find myself forced to play somebody's extreme track that takes half an hour to complete because some people are certain their creations are the s**t.Please, give this game a chance. Please.			",51,7,5,7,4,0,2

												If you give this game only a brief glance, you are going to see a simple arcade racing game where cars look like toys and drive round corners at speeds exceeding 600 km/h. But if you look under the shell and start probing deeper you shall see that TrackMania is in fact many things and it isn't in fact simple, but rather simplistic.Do you like hardcore racing where you need to hunt for tenths and hundredths of a second, and even a small concentration lapse can result in a crash when you are on a world record pace? Come on in, there's plenty of that. Do you like to build maps for others to race at? It's easy to do that with a built in editor. Maybe you prefer doing various stunts, such as backflips, barrel rolls, driving through loops or just riding the walls in a car? TM is a perfect choice for you. Just in case you like puzzles, there's a game mode for you where you have to build a fastest way between start, finish and a few checkpoints using a limited amount of blocks. Then again you can just challenge your brain and your very self to try and seek for outrageous shortcuts in others' tracks, as nobody can dictate you the order in which the checkpoints must be driven.And there's definitely more to this game than I mentioned above, feel free to discover your favourite bit of the game.One of the best things is of course the community. People are usually friendly, helpful and positive in every way.Last word from me: http://united.tm-exchange.com/ - check out this website, and the quick links. Maybe that will lead you to something that can hold you playing this game for thousands of hours.			",121,14,16,6,4,1,6

												Note I purchased this game on dvd way back when it was intially released so I have vast playtime in this game outside of steam. The only Trackmania game I had played at the time was the original. I picked it up for 5 bucks at a convention, not knoning what I would discover. I loved the track editor, and the consistant car handling making the time trials pure skill and pathfinding. Trackmania United it the refined accumulated verision of all 3 the Trackmania PC games before Trackmania 2. It's a great hot wheel style racing, It's tight. it's right. The content creation within the game is incredibly accessible enabling new content to be continuously created by players. I often play online without experiencing playing the same track twice. Anyone can easily create playable tracks resulting in a gigantic amount of tracks existing. THe online community in this game is still huge and full of dedication. For example, there's a site for sharing tracks and racetimes online that's still lively. united.tm-exchange.comLove this game. Great if you like this stuff. The competitiveness can be intense, and it can be joyful to shave a few crucial miliseconds off your best time.			",130,19,17,12,27,0,24

												There's no upgrade system in Trackmania. There's no collision detection between you and other drivers, there's no difficulty levels, no physics settings, no slow motion crashes, no random hazards, none of that. There's you. There's the clock. And there's the never-ending pursuit of the perfect line. Trackmania United is, simply put, the definitive example of a racing game in it's purest form.This is one of the only games I have ever played in recent history where the one and only factor that determines your success is your skill. You can't blame anything on other cars getting in your way, moving track pieces, or not having enough nitro to shoot you past the competition. Barring things beyond your control such as real-life distractions or equipment malfunction, whether you win or lose is entirely determinate on how skillful you are. That's it. This alone makes Trackmania United an ideal game for those who can do without more conventional elements found in other racing games; the people who are satisfied with the honor and glory of simply being more skillful than somebody else.Trackmania United is somewhat of a compilation of all the games that came before it, and when compared to the latter games in the series (the fractured release of Trackmania 2 and the console port of Trackmania Turbo) it arguably has the most content. TM2 has 3 enviornments (soon to be 4), TMT has the same 4 enviornments (reskinned as a spinoff), and TMU has 7. There's tons of tracks for each and they all have their own unique physics:-Stadium: One of the best-feeling envoirnments in the game. Stadium cars are quick, grippy, and honestly feel more grounded in reality than any of the other enviornments in the game. Not to say that I'm looking for realism in an arcade racer, just sayin. Stadium tracks demand precision, and merely grazing a wall is almost always a guarantee that you'll get a silver medal or lower.-Island: One of my personal favorites, Island cars are blazing fast and extremely drifty at high speeds. The tracks are wide with long turns to compensate, resulting in an enviornment that's a blast to drive in. Bonus, load up your favorite Ferrari skin and play Splash Wave or something in the background for some mock-OutRun fun.-Bay: Another one of my favorites, Bay cars are like a compromise between Stadium and Island. They demand the automotive dexterity of Stadium while still being almost as fast as Island. Also a lot of fun.-Snow: Snow cars are extremely grippy and can practically turn on a dime. These tracks tend to twist and snake around; don't expect a lot of straightaways, and always try to keep your eyes one corner ahead.-Rally: With scenery inspired by old rural Europe (I guess?), Rally cars are a little on the slow side and very easy to handle, and are actually a little grippier than you'd think on dirt surfaces. This is fine; you're still gonna have to pay attention to your line in order to nab those gold medals.-Desert: One of the less enjoyable enviornments in my opinion (but that's just me), Desert cars are a little awkward to get used to. You will get used to them, though, and they teach you to manage your speed as you corner, lest you lose traction and therefore valuable momentum.-Coast: My least favorite enviornment at first, Coast eventually grew on me. They're the slowest cars in the game, yet some of the hardest to control. Take a corner too fast or try to turn too hard and you start sliding, which will most likely result in that gold medal ghost cruising right past you. Where other enviornments teach you how to respond at high speeds, Coast demands patience and subtlety.Trackmania United's price tag can be a little steep when you consider it's age, but you ARE getting a ton of content. If you want to try it out first, the Stadium enviornment is available as a standalone game for free (Trackmania Nations), with a fully fleshed out singleplayer campaign, the powerful track editor, full mod support, and unlimited multiplayer. There's people out there that have logged hundreds and even thousands of hours in the free version of Stadium alone. Try that out, and if you want more, then buy United, which will give you full access to all of these features in the other 6 enviornments. United also features extra modes for a change of pace. There's the Platform mode that puts you on much more technical tracks where time isn't a factor; medals are awarded based on how many times you have to reset your car to get to the end. When was the last time you played a racing game as a platformer? It sounds gimmicky but it's actually really interesting. There's also Stunt mode, which gives you a time limit to do flips and spins to get as many points as you can, and Puzzle mode, where the game gives you an unfinished track and gives you a limited number of extra track pieces, and you have to figure out how to arange them to make the track doable. All of this, combined with the track editor, the thousands of player-created tracks to download and enjoy, and both local and online multiplayer modes makes Trackmania United one of the most expansive racing games you will ever play. You can play it how you want; turn off the opponent cars and casually try to make it to the end of a track, shoot for gold or even Nadeo medals, or even compete in asynchronous multiplayer on the singleplayer tracks by doing official races to submit your best time to the global leaderboards. You can treat United like you'd treat Nations by spending all of your time exploring the wealth of content in your favorite enviornment, or become a jack of all trades and master every car's unique driving style. There's something for everybody. I've had the game for 3 days and I've already logged over 10 hours. I know I'm gonna sink many more into this game.TL;DRTrackmania United is purely a time trial game at heart. When judged by those standards, in my opinion it is one of the only games I would ever award the title of ""flawless"" to. If you want a time trial game, or even if you're just looking for the best Trackmania game, look no further. Trackmania United is among the best of the best.			",110,8,17,3,3,0,0

												10 Years and still going strong.  IMO, the best racing game out there... still.This game is bigger outside of the US than it is inside the US.  Most of the servers you will play on (which all host unique custom races) will be outside of the US.  If you are worried about lag, don't be, as the gameplay isn't like a standard racing game.  You start a track with a specific time limit.  You can run the track as many times as you can within this time limit.  In the end, the person who managed to run the course the fastest on any given run, is the winner.  There is no collision with other players in this game, and once you play some of the tracks out there, you will know why.  It wouldn't be possible to complete them any other way.I would describe this style of racing game as a twitch racer.  If you're good at racing games and looking for a real challenge, this is it.

												Need for Speed? You'll go fast. You'll get over 800 km/h sometimes.There's a reason why 97 % people recommened this game. It's just that good. You can play in 7 enviroments that feel completely different. Each enviroment also has their own vehicle which you can paint to your liking. You have over 400 races, platforms, stunts, and puzzles to beat.The game may seem really hard at first, but you'll get used to it quite fast. Some tracks are fairy easy, while others provide extreme challange, and to get golden medal (highest reward you can get for each track), you'll need to play it litterally 50 times to get beat golden medal requirements.While graphics do look outdated compared to modern games, the gameplay is perfect, and could hardly be any better, so don't worry too much about that.If you are into making your own tracks, this is the best game out there to do so. You can make tracks for all 7 enviroments. There is simple editor to get used to basics, and once you get used to it, there is very, very complex editor that allows you to everything with all objects in the game.Multiplayer is still active. It offers tons of superb custom made tracks that will provide additional challange.The specs for the game are very, very low for nowadays PC gaming standards, and don't worry about compatibility. The game runs great on Windows 10 (I play it on 10 myself).If you have never played Trackmania game, you should try this one even if you don't like racing. It's really fun game to play. If you have already played other Trackmania games, you should buy it too because it's currently the best one you can get. It offers so much content, that even though it's almost 10 years old, it's still worth the asking price.The only people that shouldn't buy this game, are people who have played Trackmania games before, and didn't enjoy them. It's unlikely that you will like this one, if you didn't like the other ones.You can try how game feels for free, as stadium enviroment is available for free here:Have fun and get gut.

												I consider this game one of my alltime favorites. There is so much that goes into this game. you can have so much fun playing the single player tracks and earning medals, also as you learn the ""bugs"" which will benefit alot once you become a better player and understand more about the physics ..then taking all this into multiplayer and it will become very addictive! Taking this one step further in hosting servers and you will be hooked like I was for years!

												This game isn't a racing game like all others. Trackmania has its own things that makes it a special racing game - the physics for time attacking.You can ride with cars over nice maps build by Nadeo, or a community on 7 different environments. Collect medals by improving your time. Chase your friends to see who's better driver. Build your own maps and share your maps with others, for example on tm-exchange.com. There's a lot of stuff you can do related to cars.True, you can do all of this in Nations, but United is another big expirience of driving with different cars and enjoying their unique environments. Please don't waste your money on this game because of Coppers support, it's stupid.Now my review:Gameplay (6 points max):There are no car collisions, which is the biggest thing that makes this a time attacking game.  Simple to understand, drive from start to finish in a fastest time, or drive multiple laps on multilap track. That's all you need to know. Car physics itself are REALLY good. 7 enviroments with different cars means 7 different car physics. The car react just as you press the key and it's possible to understand how the car works. Obviously you need to play for some time to be good at driving. Hard to tell if it's good idea to spend some months to skill yourself for such a dead game, because there are no competitions atm, but you can still rank up in official rankings of Solo tracks.Because cars are sometimes buggy and time attack can result some unlucky moments, I'm rating it 5.5/6.Graphics (3 points max):Graphics. They're old for sure, but quite good on it's release date. Anyways it isnt really close to today game's graphics. When you look at the game, it's a game where environment (not gameplay environment) really matters.Hard to decide, but I'm rating it 1.75/3.Atmosphere (1 point max):This game has it's own atmosphere, like most of the games. But this one brings memories of older games like 2004-2008 - their graphics bugs, simple design, gameplay. If you played older versions of Trackmania like Sunrise or Original, then you'll understand the feeling. :D Anyway I think it deserves clean 1 point. It isn't messy game with all kinds of things that don't fit together.So my rating is (5.5 + 1.75 + 1): 8.25/10I'll say it simply, this game is awesome. This rating comparing to today games is very very good on 2008 game.Community is very VERY friendly. Trackmania has one of the friendliest communities ever. From my expirience, I have no doubt of that. :D United community is dying (actually it's pretty dead now), but you can still meet some players around the servers and things.You want to decide if to buy this game for 30 bucks or stay at Nations. It's simple: Do you want to try something new in a game you know? For myself I really enjoyed playing all of these enviroments and I'm still enjoying that! But if you're not really into trying other 6 environments for this amount of money (I understand, it's a lot), then don't go for it.Overall I of course recommend this game. Absolutely no doubts about that. If you're trying to find a solid multienvironmental racing game rather for singleplayer purposes, this can be a good choice for you. :)			",38,5,5,3,7,2,1

												This game is the paid full version of Trackmania Nations Forever, for all intents and purposes. If you're thinking about buying United, but you're on the fence, play Nations Forever first. The real question worth answering is: should I upgrade to this game, or just stick with Nations Forever?In short, get it if: You want to avoid the multiplayer limitations in TMNF You want more single-player tracks You want to become more competitive in multiplayer, or in single-player time trial You don't mind the bugs in TMNFmultiplayer limitations in Nations ForeverIn Nations Forever, there are a few multiplayer limitations added to the game that incentivise players to upgrade - the most obvious being: you can only go on FreeZone servers; car skins are not visible to other players; and every fifth track you will be relegated to being a spectator.Spectating every fifth track can be pretty annoying, especially if you were hoping to play a specific track but need to sit out. Also, the chat is disabled when you are 'FreeZoned', which is unnecessary and frustrating. If you are into the multiplayer, this will probably be the biggest advantage that United has over Nations Forever.single-player tracksUnited adds a boat load more single-player tracks over Nations Forever (which still has quite a lot)! It also adds some legacy environments to the game, which are probably familiar to the player of older TM games (Sunrise, woo!). Bear in mind that the cars handle really differently in the other environments, so it can be a little jarring to play them.on competitivenessI don't really play competitive, but the single-player leaderboard system is really expanded in United, showing (as in the later games) your placement among your peers. Of course, if you play multiplayer, the far more important aspect is that you can join any server rather that those in the FreeZone.bugsThis game is really old. And it includes content from games older still. If you find bugs in TMNF, don't expect them to be fixed in United.All in all, it is a great game, and whether you get United, stick with Nations Forever, or buy a newer Trackmania, you'll still get a great and addictive racing game.

												Played this game since 2009, I probably wasted about 700 hours in it, I didn't use Steam back then. The game is absolutely amazing! It features all the environments (different playstyles basically) from the original Trackmania, Trackmania Sunrise and Trackmania Nations. I don't think it is worth buying as a standalone game nowadays, as the community is pretty much dead. It is a great addition to the ""Celebrat10n TrackMania Complete Pack"", however, and I recommend to check it out alongside with TrackMania 2 titles if you like competitive racing games.

I wanted to play it so bad, but I never got to. Fast forward to about 5 months ago. I FINALY found  that game... by accedent. Thanks steam! Comming in clutch again! Anyway, I was pumped to play, and I LOVED IT! Then my freind told me about the trackmaina 2 trilogy. I was gonna get it, but then I saw this. This... masterpiece. This... MASTERPEICE! THIS UNDERRATED GEM OF A GAME! In my opinion, it is one of the best games ever! It is so hard, it is so big, and it is so fun!

												Probably the most openly customizible racing game ever created, Trackmania United Forever allows your most unrealistic, yet incredible childhood racing dreams to become reality. If you want to drive a certain car, you can put new ones into the game. If you want to completely Retexture the Track environment, you can do that too. The only limit that exists in Trackmania is the imagination (and your editing abilities).			",76,20,5,6,7,0,1

												First things first. You probably want to know if Trackmania is even worth buying, right ? Don't lie to yourself. Good. Ok, let me tell you; it's worth it. There. I said it. So what's the difference between this game and the free one ? Honestly ? I have no idea. But it's such a fun game that you should go and buy it anyway to support the developers for even creating games like these, and to do yourself a favor of course. For those who don't know what Trackmania is all about; you basically drive a car (no sims here, it's all arcade racing) and have to beat the lap times. Easy enough, right ? Well, anyone can win a bronze medal in this game. If you want the gold one you have to drive perfect though. You have to know when to slow down, where to jump, how to take corners, everything. THAT's the challenge. It's great ! And it's even more epic when you play this game 'with' your friends. Epic I tell you ![Rating: 85/100]			",1657,631,69,221,194,16,225
