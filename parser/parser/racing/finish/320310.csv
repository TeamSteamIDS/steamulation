												So much wanted to like this, I'm still waiting for a good Truck Racing Game (Best one so far was a freeware game from Renault i had a few years back).Pros:Graphics are not that bad at 1920x1080 with Max settings.You can quit the game.Cons:It's a Unity 3D Game (This depends on taste some like unity some don't, i don't).Controls are really bad and strange (Some times it will turn as expected then slide and pretty much stop, other time's it just keeps going straight, even if you slowed down for the bend?).Sound is awful, Music is slightly better.Menu's have nice icons but don't tell you what said icon does, so you have to click it to see what it does.Sorry but i don't recomend this game, even if it was free i would not recomend, Could not bring myself to even finish 1 race.

												Awful. Horrible. Don't buy it. Xbox controller does not work properly, graphics are quite mediocre, the menus are disgusting, the sound of the engines and specially the breakes is pathetic, the controls are the thing I hate the most of the games. 10 bucks is way too much for such a horrible game. Don't waste your time and money. There are better alternatives such as Truck racer. It costs the double but at least it's a decent game. The pictures and the videos of the game sugest that it's a good game but when you try it in the first 10 seconds you realize that the game will not meet the expectations. Playing this game is one of the most frustrating expierences I ever had on steam and that's why I will just uninstall it and try other games.Final score: Horrible 1/10.			",510,173,72,37,64,10,72

												Move over Euro Truck Simulator, because there's a new six wheeled menace tearing its way through the pristine roads of Europe! World Truck Racing brings you all the big excitement of a mobile racing game to the PC! You won't find arcade action here, just straight up 8 monster machines challenging for number one across 15 events, spanning anywhere between 3 - 9 races in each event.You are racing semis, big rigs, just the cabs, no cargo. Flat nose and long nose. The choice is up to you. The game plays easy, far too easy. Its all automatic transmission, no gear shifting, there isn't even an option to make it manual. On a X-Box 360 controller, the left analog stick will steer, accelerate and brake all in one. So up is to accelerate, down is to brake. Its an easy system. There are keyboard controls too.Each race takes place in an official closed track, much like F-1 with twists, turns, and flat terrain. There are a variety of tracks, but they all feel the same. Spectators near the finish line, walls everywhere else and a few things to drive under. There's grass off to the side of the pavement and sand off most turns. The only real difference from track to track is the weather. Rain, sunshine and the dead of night. It makes it look different yes, but its still the same. Rain will make you skid and drive slower overall. I can't say that night gives you limited visibility when a closed course is lit up.The glaring thing missing from the game is presentation. Its not that the graphics aren't top notch high quality, its the details. The menu is probably one of the most generic race menus that I've seen in several racing games. There's no fanfare after a race. No cheers, no celebration, no lights, no glory. Instead a few seconds after the race finishes, a board just shows up telling you the rank. None of the scores carry over from race to race. The delay with this ladder makes me think why they don't just have it instantly as you cross the finish line?There are pit lanes on all these tracks that you can drive down, but there are no pit crews. With races being so short, there's no reason to need a pit stop. No vehicles take or show damage so much as they can spin out or slam into a wall head on, then just drive backward and get back on the pavement.You can select a truck in the garage, pick its color, tweak its brakes, acceleration and everything, but using the default load outs, I managed to snag first place through each race of several events. Of course it is still early, perhaps at event 15, it gets crazy tough and I need to be a real grease monkey to find the perfect combination for all those hair pin turns.I can't even say I'm that good at the game, because it feels like the opponents are just bad. When it comes to turns, they'll often be in the grass, on the dirt or spinning out one another. Yet if I try to spin someone around by ramming the side of my cab against their back, nothing will happen. No effect. Heck, the game still has Unity's default icon as its game icon.Since I take the lead within the first turn or so from the back of the pack, I'm just stuck racing myself. The only challenge becomes shaving a second off my last lap. The game shows you how many seconds ahead or behind you are, but for 9 races, once I took the lead, no one could take it back from me, even if I went into the sand and had to start from first gear again.When you select a race, you need to start it, then it will ask you to skip or start training. If you skip it, then you need to start the race again and get a new choice to skip or start the qualifying. If you chose skip, then you need to select to start a third time and then you can actually start the race. It feels like a few extra necessary steps.What feels even stranger is the fact that sometimes there's a glitch that won't let me race in one that I've already competed in. So if I didn't complete that race, I need to select to edit my rig, before I can enter the race and go through the three part, skip or start process all over again.There are a few modes, the tour mode is the main one, profiles to see your racing career and race mode that needs to get unlocked. Its just the bare minimum I expect from a racing game. I wouldn't mention the graphics options, but in these options I can select almost any resolution, such as my native 1360 x 768, but when I do, my monitor still tells me the game is 1024 x 768 resolution.When you race, the on screen display shows your speed, time and lap. There's no map showing you where anyone else is. You can change the camera angle from following your truck, to inside the cab, on the hood and hanging off the side. What's a real shame is the mirrors do not show a reflection. The hood view is a little silly considering if you're driving a flat nose rig, you still have a hood somehow.As for the sound, you hear the same engine whir the entire 6+ minutes of each race. There's a music loop in the menus, but that's about it. This is clearly a budget title and there's nothing wrong with that, I just wish it was more fun.After watching the trailer, they make it look far more exciting than it is. Its really you alone for 6 minutes, because you're so far in the lead. No challenge, no difficulty setting.There's just nothing keeping me in this game. There are so many better games out there that either offer more challenge, better driving or better graphics. There's nothing wrong with a budget title, but outside of its ""Truck Racing"" gimmick, there's just nothing here.			",1122,324,51,104,96,15,167

												Ouch!! is my first reaction. Clunky UI I tried to see past when I eventually managed to play the game. Man I know it isn't a sim but even as an arcade the feeling of control is limited. The graphics turned up to max settings are lets be honest, fairly bad, in some areas the graphics look ok, only some areas which is the rear of the truck. Inside the trucks cab is awful and lacking head movement. I usually play from within my vehicles but this one is impossible to do. Oh and thier is a mixed language going on, from Polish, to English to I think Italian at one point I saw on my screen!  The driving controls are simple but you will get arm ache just trying to get these ""trucks"" around the different tracks. You've to steer then counter steer, brake and steer and woah betide you if you hit the spacebar to use the hand brake, you will spin off slowly. The actual driving is so bad that the Ai kept going off!!  The game engine behind this is old, it feels old and unpolished. Requires more effort to bring it upto a standard that I would call a reasonable arcade game.   Even if you master the controls and navigate around the menus, the enjoyment factor is lost as your constantly trying to keep the truck from drifting across the road and coming to a very quick stop. If the gameplay was more fluid and the control was better then maybe the graphics could be overlooked but seeing your constantly watching the track and other parts of the screen, you cannot escape them. Would I recommend? No I would not, save your cash for the ETS2 DLCs or the upcoming ATS. This game is not really that much fun, sorry guys and girls.			",55,9,25,3,54,0,1

I think this is what 'Big Rigs' would have become if they continued developing it.Your settings does not save, they get reset when you quit the game.Truck sounds is like a shoppingcart full of tin cans being pushed down a flight of stairs.Do NOT buy this game, i already did, and that's one person too many.

YouTube™ Video: world truck racing - truck off 

			Views: 6		

			World truck racing. Billed as high octane truck racing sim. but will it pass the finish line and end up on the podium or just end in a crash? Lets find out...		

I will begin this review by confirming that, as other reviews have stated, the game is outright broken. Once you play the end of stage four the game will just crash, and you cannot progress any further. Th is might not be such an issue except that you need to complete the stages in order to unlock all the tracks, which you cannot do because of this game breaking bug.With that said your not really missing a lot as the tracks all have a pretty samey feel, the different trucks you can choose all feel pretty much identical, and the limited vehicle tuning has absolutely no effect on the trucks performance. Graphics are average and the physics and handeling of the trucks is arcade at best. The AI is for the most part braindead - it will randomly just drive off track, spin out or crash and even on its highest setting you will prety much be in first place before you have even completed the first lap.  It will not give you a challenge at any time. Do yourself a favour and give this one a miss - if you really want good truck racing buy Race 07 and download one of the free truck racing mods - you will get far more for your money.

There is literally no flaw in this game.Edit:After some time playing, there is actually one negative aspect about this game. There are many Zablokowany Trucks that I can't drive, which is really unfair since the opponents have access to those trucks. If this gets patched the game would be flawless again.
