												I wanted this game to be good but sadly didn't even need 30 minutes of gameplay to see that it is not what I'm looking for.  Not to say that some hardcore NASCAR fans desperate for an arcade game won't enjoy it, but to many there are far too many drawbacks.Graphics are not very good.  Draw distance and anti-aliasing are problematic, and the overall texture quality and lighting is sub par.  Taking F1 2016 as a comparison, NHE looks years behind the current standard.Gameplay is unexciting and unrealistic even when changing the settings to suit my desires.  Hitting the wall or other cars does not have realistic effects.  Damage, despite being set to ""full damage"", barely occurs unless you have a huge impact.If this game was priced at $20, I might be able to look past this shortcomings and find enjoyment in the only fully licensed NASCAR game option, but at $60 the expectations are much higher.  Sadly, this game falls short in many areas.I was very much hoping for a casual break from the intensity of iRacing, however I will stick to other, better racing games for my casual fix, and iRacing for my competitive racing.

												Edit: 3 hours in, been doing the career mode; managed to scrape a win at Bristol. AI is very competetive, and aggressive but in the right areas! The game needs a bit of work on the plate tracks (Daytona, 'Dega) as it's a bit clunky. So far I'm very impressed with what this game is turning out to be. It's fun to be able to race against an AI knowing they're not going to just dump you like in NASCAR '15.Pros:- Great, competent AI- Close, fast paced racing- Fun Career mode, I enjoyed every race, despite finishing an average of 18th- Challenge modes offer quick, easy funCons:- Not all 40 drivers are 'Cup' drivers- Cautions sometimes don't come out when they should- AI on plate tracks needs tweakingOverall - If you're looking for a NASCAR game that's competetive, fun and challenging then this is the game you're looking for. It's not as in depth as iRacing, but for a 'casual' game it destroys all previous titles made by ETX.			",68,4,15,3,13,0,11

												Tired of all these games under NASCAR license in recent years !Too arcadish, oversimplified, ridiculous damages and crashes, poor physics... And this game doesn't correctly support wheels like my G25. We have to set it in an obscur text file !NHE is not ugly, it is even pretty neat, and run at 60fps, but needs more shaders (especially real time reflection).Engine sounds too synthetic, too discrete and poorly mixed.I would like to see a true resurrection of NASCAR 2003 with current technologies !iRacing is that but overpriced and based on a timetable, so it's the opposite extreme !Finally, I am aware that Monster Games and Dusenberry Martin Racing are starting from scratch, and I guess NASCAR license is not given. Yes, much work was needed to realize this game, but... We need to be aware that the asking price is too expensive for a mixed result !So my advice: wait to see if the game will continue to be supported by developers with significant improvements...

												Played every NASCAR HEAT game there has been. They were always good, they always brought something new or interesting, and everything worked out. Visuals were great, simulation physics were awesome. They offered a great challenge to NASCAR fans. This time around?If you expected Dirt to Daytona Returns... you are going to be disappointed.The car feels like it has 10000000lb of downforce, you can charge into the corner, and somehow a 3500lb race car turns into a formula car that doesn't even wear tires.Setting up a car is quite interesting, but it makes no sense playing around with it when you beat everyone on the default setup on a car that has all the grip in the world.It is a stock car, it should be hard to drive, it should move all over the place, it should struggle to find grip.If you use a wheel, it feels disconected from the car. Has a huge dead spot on initial turn in. There's no feel of what the tires are doing. It feels flat at all times. -won't even bother trying it with a pad. Waste of time. Visuals are not that good; cars look like toys, catchfencing looks even worse at the distance, as if there was no AA. Tracks lack on everthing, doesn't matter what camera you are using, it looks as if you were looking at a 4:3 screen and they stretched to sort of fill up the 16:9 format.AI is OK, if you want to jump straight for a challenge; set the difficulty yourself. That's about the only thing that really works as it did on old HEAT games and the only thing to keep someone interested in progressing in the game. For casuals it will be fun, AI is too easy to beat if set on auto, once you find how to push the car, you can win by 30 seconds or more, even if you start at the back. If you are a hardcore sim racer... save your money, get a grip and join iRacing.Feel sorry to say it. Monster Games used be great at portraying the sport. They failed this time. It isn't even a rebadged/updated NASCAR HEAT game. It is the unrecognized son of Eutechnyx.			",31,2,10,1,0,0,0

Posted: December 8, 2016
												When I was growing up, I was really into NASCAR. I played Heat on the PC tons as a kid, even when my family lost interest in the actual races. After years of lackluster to outright terrible NASCAR games, I struggled to find anything I could recommend to people who had a cursory interest in it and didn't want a kart racer or the sheer amount of setup a sim takes. And now, I finally have a new NASCAR title I can actually recommend to people, and I'm so glad it came during one of the best seasons of racing I've seen in a long time.Being set in the 2016 Sprint Cup, the roster is made up mainly of the drivers that appeared at every race in the season, with a few changes. Substitute drivers aren't present here, for one. This leads to some interesting situations with Alex Bowman and Jeff Gordon, who filled in for Dale Earnhardt Jr, being entirely absent while Junior races the whole season, as well as Matt DiBenedetto having a huge roster of paint schemes on the #83 that weren't his. It makes for an interesting alternate continuity if, like me, you overly fixate on that sort of thing.The Sprint Cup may be the only series represented here, but a few drivers make cameos from the Xfinity, Truck, and even K&N series. It doesn't really make up for the series' absence here, but it's a very nice touch to include names from the era that fans would know. Erik Jones in particular gets a bit of a spotlight due to being the one NPC driver not in the real-life 2016 Sprint Cup who is present in the career mode; as his debut in the Cup would be in 2017 anyways, it works out just fine.If you've played earlier NASCAR games, these are pretty much all courses you know by now. The lack of anything from other series stands out to me a bit, due to the Eldora truck race being what brought me back into NASCAR in the first place, but it's still a full 23-course roster with two road courses, and isn't missing a single course from the entire Cup season, which as much as I love the classic titles, can't be said about them. None of these are ports from older titles. They're all completely remade from scratch as far as I can tell.Challenges are included rather oddly. There's one for each track, and completing them unlocks a video of a (Toyota) driver giving you a walkthrough of the track as in-game footage plays of the track in the background. These seem to have been meant for a continuation of Heat's Race the Pro mode, where drivers would give you a similar walkthrough of the course with video footage of them driving it in real life, and then you would challenge them on-track. Here, you unlock advice on how to navigate the track when you successfully complete the challenge at that track, and thus no longer have use for this information. It's very backwards and pointless. (Plus, the in-game track walkthrough doesn't sync with the driver commentary at all, making it very disorienting to follow.)The core gameplay builds on the base of Heat 2002, and by ""builds on"" I mean ""pretty much exactly ports"". On the default settings, the strange drifting you can pull off on road courses is still present, the steady clunk of shifting through the gears is just the same, and... actually, judging by lap times, the actual speeds of the cars have not been adjusted at all from 2002. They're essentially a fresh model slapped over the Winston Cup cars, and though it's not accurate, for the sake of gameplay, it works just fine. It feels like an expansion pack for Dirt to Daytona, except released fourteen years later.It's far more on the arcade side of the spectrum, at least on default settings. It's an exaggerated, condensed fight to the top, but it works extremely well in a silly video-game-y context. As with previous Heat titles, you aren't going to easily magically walk away with the win unless you're willing to either fight for it or crank down the difficulty. However, concerningly, there is a third option; cheat. All sorts of dirty, underhanded tactics pay off far better than they really should here, and with the lax penalties, there's a good chance you'll pick up some really, really nasty habits here. Cutting below the yellow line, smashing opponents into the wall, and getting into other drivers' wheelwells are all valid tactics. Worst of them, the best way to take a corner in most cases is to just take two diagonal lines; one up into the corner, then slam into the side of another driver, and just floor it to the outside of the corner. This is not okay and should not work. At all.Controller rumble is repurposed less for the sake of sensation of the track and more to communicate when you've got a good draft. It works extremely well. The draft in general is very intuitive, and picking up a good sense of where you can and can't make use of it to slingshot is very much doable.One of the major things a licensed racing game has to get right is the AI. Not just being generally competent and competitive, which the AI here mostly is (though the ""adaptive difficulty"" is nothing new to fans of 2003 Season and such), but also in-character. Larson fights his way through the field from the back, much like the instance where he had fresh tires against a field of worn-out cars and compared it to, well, a racing game. Going bumper-to-bumper with Logano is a terrifying experience. DiBenedetto really mostly just does pretty okay. It's been a long while since I've seen a NASCAR title not just slap liveries onto identically-behaving drivers, and it's very refreshing to have personality back.Career mode is definitely a bit bizarre an experience. It feels like 1/4 of Dirt to Daytona. In that, I found myself funding my Cup cars with money earned in successful runs in the Truck series. Without that as an option here, it's much more of a grind to have a decent vehicle, having to just basically accept that you'll be stuck underperforming for a long time until you can scrape together enough for an upgrade.You create your character, and watch as they stand there on the menu. That's it. They don't even serve as your picture in the stats; you still show up as a blank silhouette there. Once again, you can see the ambition that was intended here, but clearly features got cut before they got to make any actual use of them, leaving weird half-finished frays chucked in the final product. Your manager's represented with a single stock photo, as well. As far as the championship format goes, it is, by necessity, accurate to the real-life Chase system, so if you don't like it in actual racing, you won't like it here. Luckily, outside of career mode, you can dump this format entirely and go back to points if you feel like it.The graphics went for a very engaging, bright array of colors. It brings Daytona USA to mind, and it looks gorgeous in action. However, extremely poor anti-aliasing and jittery framerate leads to it feeling like one of those 2002 titles being run through an emulator, no matter the amount of meticulous detail on the actual cars. The catch fences are a near-constant blur of pixels. This is extremely distracting at first, and takes a few races to learn to ignore.The sound design is alright. The sound fidelity is not good. The vast majority of the sound effects are outright ported from Dirt to Daytona, compression and all. Button presses on the menu sound chalky, crowd cheers are a very short static loop, and engine sounds are the same recordings as years ago but pitched down (that last bit actually works just fine, but it's amusing anyways). Bobby Labonte does a decent job as the default spotter. The music is high-fidelity and very catchy, though I have a sneaking suspicion it didn't come from an in-house team, instead being licensed from one of those royalty-free sound places. Bizarrely, there's no credits option that I can find to confirm this.As I've hit the character limit in the review, tldr; it's 2002 again but it's just as good as it was then.

												It took me only 21 minutes to come to my conclusion about this game. As an avid race fan, and someone who's been physically involved in the sport since I've been old enough to, this game SUCKS. Here's why:- It's an arcade game. Yes, even with ""Simulation"" mode.- If you play in first-person, the cars feel VERY sluggish.- The handling is far from realistic.- Multiplayer literally had four players.- The visuals are gross, and plastic almost.- Antialiasing was checked, but there was no Antialiasing.- Random stutters- Don't go three wide, the AI will wreck you every time.- The sounds were used 16 YEARS AGO. There's no excuse for that.These are just a few reasons not to purchase this pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I could go on all day. All I've heard is how this is DMRacings first game in years, but that is no excuse for this game. Dirt to Daytona is 30 times better than this game. Want a modern NASCAR game? Do yourself a favor and purchase NASCAR 15. If not, NR2003. I'll be getting my money back. You let me down guys. Should have known better.			",113,4,1,7,8,1,4

												After recieving a refund for this game already, I ended up doing a lot of thinking. I'm fairly certain that nobody SANE is going to tell you that this is a perfect game. I think a lot of us came in here expecting big things from a company that hasn't done anything big in well over a decade. Deep down, I think I was most frustrated that we didn't get another NR2003 (well, no♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's not supposed to be!). If you can make it past the fact that this game isnt trying to be the next big sim, its a lot of fun, in a BIG way.The biggest thing that DMR has done right with this game is their AI. While not perfect, I haven't enjoyed racing against computers in a long, long time. While I enjoy a good multiplayer simulator, I personally get more enjoyment out of some solid, singleplayer fun. If that is something you've been looking for in a NASCAR game, I highly recommend NHE. I can't speak for controller users, but my steering wheel is great, casual racing.All-in-all, If I were you, It wouldn't hurt to wait for the game to go on sale, however, we need to remember that without our support, DMR won't be able to come back with a better game. I think these guys can do really good things for the NASCAR franchise, we just have to give them a chance.TL;DR - Keep an open mind. This isn't a simulator. If you enjoy a casual, feel good racing game, take a serious look into NHE.			",110,14,24,29,23,2,10

												What a disappointment . For the pass few month , Game creater have been talking about giving us the ""Most Realistic nascar game Experience'' ,But from what i experience after plying this game for 25 min, One word ""Arcade"" . To be honest nascar 2015 the ""Wheels to track physics""(How the car get losse from old tire/setup etc ,how the car react when u dive onto the apron, How the car react when you ran diffent lanes, How you spin out etc)  was so much more realistic then nascar heat . $55 SGD for this game? No man it is not worth it , i would ratter stick with nascar2015 physics then to heat . I am not kidding this game is not worth $55 SGD and also not worth it for nascar fan . This will be my currenlty review , i am not sure if they will improve it, let just hope they do big changes to the physics , which it bery much needed right now. If not i am just gona refund .

												I'm saddened that this game came out in the condition and for the price it did.  The developer should've known that their audience was weary of past titles and were going to be quick to judge. In all fairness though, this game is far better than any nascar title in the last ten years. yes its bare bones in ways but it gets alot of things right. The AI is the best I've raced against since NR2003 and the updated rules of the chase and lucky dog and even the frequency of the yellow flag being thrown is way better than previous titles. The graphics are good and the cars are extremely accurate.  The career mode needs work but is also leaps ahead of other titles. Yes there's no paintshop and no way of modding but in my opinion of being a fan of the sport for 40 years, this is a very good start to a new future of NASCAR games and its been forever since I could say that. Hope that someone reads this and gives this title a fair shake. It truly deserves it.			",26,5,10,0,1,0,0

Posted: September 24, 2016
												This is my first review of any Steam game, but given all the negative attention, I thought I'd try to give the game an objective look. I started out playing the game on a 360 type controller in arcade mode. It's fun, yet challenging. I had trouble with the challenges, and short tracks that require braking took very fine finesse. After a couple of days doing that, I installed my G27 steering wheel. I looked up some videos on Youtube to see how to set up, and it feels comfortable.  Simulation mode is a little more difficult, and the challenges and short tracks and are a little easier. Now, I was playing NASCAR games during the golden age of the late 90's and early 2000s. I played a lot of the Payprus NASCAR games, and I loved them a lot. I also remember when the first NASCAR Heat came out. It was a nice little reprieve from just simulation. This game feels more like that original NASCAR Heat. It can be fun, and challenging. But what this is not is a new version of the old Payprus NASCAR Racing games.This game isn't perfect. But I also don't have any misconceptions of what this game is. It's a sequel to the 2000 NASCAR Heat. It's not NASCAR Racing 2003. Like everyone else, I think it's a shame that it's been over 13 years since we've had something that good. But I don't expect that from this devloper.I think there are a couple of issue. Practice on the track is very annoying because the AI keeps slamming into the back of you. The adaptive AI can make the game more playable, but can also be annoying. With the controller, I had a hard time breaking out of the Top 20, even after improvements to the team/garage/car were made. Maybe that's just me. What works really well overall is the AI while racing. This is the kind of AI we've been waiting for. One that adjusts to you being on the track. I've had some really amazing battles, and yet the AI and I didn't destroy our cars in the process. As someone who's played the last couple of NASCAR titles, this AI is miles ahead. Now the big question: Is it worth $60? Yes and no. This feels like a $40 game. But the amount of time I have spent playing it, and the parts I enjoy, I don't regret the $60 I spent. Also, as a business owner myself, I see consumers gripe about prices all the time. This company paid for the NASCAR license and had devlopers working for them. They have to cover their costs. If they don't get a profit, then they can't reinvest in improving the game, and there's no incentive to do what they do. I've dealt with the same thing, as everyone wants something for free and wants the business to foot the bill.			",44,11,10,5,29,1,24

												Let me preface this review by saying that I play on simulation mode, with a Logitech GT wheel and pedal set.  I am also reviewing the current version of the game, not what was put out at launch.This game does have a handful of drawbacks and has many things that it can improve upon, but I still find myself enjoying the overall experience.  Beginning with the positives, contrary to what other reviewers are saying I really enjoy the driving.  Now its not “simulation” by any stretch of the imagination, but I didn’t expect it to be. I expected it to be rather arcade like with some small details of realism sprinkled in, and that’s what I find it to be.  The connection you feel with the car isn’t perfect but I find this to be due more to poor force feedback and lackluster engine, tire and braking sounds than the actual physics of the driving itself.  Also, the car behaves well and somewhat realistically to some adjustments, like spring changes and wedge adjustments, but not realistically to others (for example sometimes running at 7,000RPM creates a faster lap time than maxing out every straightaway).  Also, the tire wear is non existent, allowing you to put max camber into the tire for maximum grip and no penalty.Visually the game looks very good. The cars sometimes look awkward and unrealistic while cornering, but the replays look great and the way the sun glimmers off the cars is a very nice touch.  I frequently find myself watching the replays after the races just to enjoy the art.Finally, just to touch on the AI, I don’t find it to be as good as many people are claiming. The one key reason for this is that they take some very peculiar lines around the tracks, particularly in the tri-ovals of 1.5 mile tracks.  Kansas I noticed to be particularly dubious, as they swing extemeley abruptly down near the apron and do not follow a logical smooth path. It’s very unnatural looking and hard to race against. I would also like the AI to present a little more of challenge. I haven’t tried the adaptive speed control yet, but 105 is too easy on the vast majority of the tracks.Overall, even with the drawbacks, I’m enjoying the game.  This could possibly be due to the low expectations I had, I’m not sure. But it’s a good starting point for the series and a huge improvement over the previous generation of NASCAR games.

												So i purchased 30 mins ago. Spent 20 mins trying to get the MOMO to work. It recogs the inputs on the intial setup screen, but does not save them. Go in game, only recogs steering.Requested refund.NOTE* Ive been Nascar racing since N1 on floppy discs (1995?). I have every Papy N game, all EA N games, as well as the orginal Heat. All the latest N games from DM. This game is NOT for us. This is for game controller crossovers. No mouse support? Stupid. But I get it, its $$$$. You can see the low budget allowed on ressurecting this software. Not their fault. Its plain greed from their higher ups. Want to fix this greed? Vote with your wallet.If your wheel/pedal works, your'e lucky. Good for you. All other drivers, your risk, just dont wait too long for refund request. I waited 30 mins.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After two, count 'em, refunds and a pretty toxic Steam review, now deleted, I still came back for more, as I realized I had been looking at this title completely the wrong way. I confess what I wanted was a new NR2003 and, of course, NHE isn't close to being a full sim. I therefore spent both initial evaluation periods trying to see what wasn't realistic about the title - completely the wrong way to assess it...I decided to reappraise the game on its own terms and, amazingly, now I've come to terms with what it isn't, I'm actually thrilled with what it is. It's vital to get your wheel dialled in, and when you do the driving model suddenly comes alive. This, combined with the stunning AI makes for a very satisfying race experience. Yes, I'd love to have fully driveable pit stops and cautions, but putting those thoughts aside, there's actually a really fun experience here, with enough challenge to keep most simmers pretty happy. Not the last word in Nascar sim racing, but actually a very good start by DMR. I really hope they service the game's numerous issues with patches, especially the hit and miss caution implementation, and build on what, when one rids oneself of one's narrow preconceptions, is a pretty engrossing little racer. I'll be buying all the DLC to show my support. There's a lot of promise here, once the blinkers are off.			",29,1,22,2,12,1,6

												So far im up to my 4th season and its great. Its not as bad as people make it out to be it has its flaws like the rubberbanding which for me is very inconsistent other than that issue its very enjoyable for me otherwise i wouldn't have put allmost 50 hours in. Dont get it for Multiplayer but for the career mode , i think career is where the game shines. Multiplayer would be awesome if only we could get a player base going. I think wait for a sale and get the game if you don't wanna play full price. Controller is better suited for the game than a racing wheel so remember that. All in all it's a fun game very enjoyable and needs a community.			",87,18,6,13,11,0,7

												Don't get me wrong, this is the best NASCAR game that I have played in a long time.The improvement from the ETX games is completly shown and there is much room for improvement on this game also (maybe not as much as ETX though...)I would, and have, reccomended this game to a friend 10 times out of 10. But there are some dissapointments..Pros:- Lots of fun for all ages, and many ways to play- Good graphics, bring in the new and out with the old- FPS friendly (my pc just meets the minimum requirements and i can run a smooth 60 on max settings)- Refined for 2016 rules, schedule, championship, and aero packages- Sim mode is the most realistic offical NASCAR video game experience yet- NASCAR Next drivers (I love seeing the young drivers in the spotlight no matter how)Cons:- Not all tracks have safer barrier the full length around (NASCAR requires all tracks to have Safer Barrier walls encircling the whole track)- Braking too hard in arcade mode unrealistically spins the car out and removes all momentum- CAUTIONS DO NOT COME OUT WHEN THEY SHOULD (I have barrel rolled down the frontstretch at Texas and driven backwards towards the pack without caution..with all flags enabled)In conclusion I would rate this game 7.5/10 in comparison to the other NASCAR video games I have played.I have loved NASCAR all my life and have been playing the games ranging from Dirt to Daytona, NASCAR '99, and NASCAR '15 Victory Edition. I would love to see improvements to this game because I see a lot of potential, and I have faith in DMR.Suggestions to developers:- LISTEN TO THE FANS PLEASE, WE ALL LOVE YOU			",4,1,10,0,0,0,0

Can't get past the front screen and if we have to edit a file with NO guides to get stuff to work thats wrong!

												I have one complaint about the game, I can't find a way to reconfigure the controller and you can only use a XBOX controller.  Seriously guys, PC gaming is about having many options.  Other than that the graphics are great (running dual GTX 970 SLI) and it runs smoothly at 60+ FPS. So far the overall game play and available car adjustments are decent, I like it.

												This game is a lot of fun for the hardcore NASCAR fan looking for a game that actually works....however there are some issues.  Career mode is pretty slim, cautions don't come out when they should, not really a damage model.  However since this is their first new game, it's a good start.

												First and foremost, don't buy this game if you are expecting a sim racer. That being said there is a lot to love out of this first iteration of this almost sim-cade game. A game engine that isn't entirely garbage. A menu system, that while simple, functions and gets the job done. And that's what a lot of this game is. Simplicity, and getting the job done. Does it lack certain features of former games yes, but what it does lack, is made up for in actual functionality and the game working and running (for most people, don't know why people supposedly can't install it).I've done a first look/quick review of the game on my YouTube channel that shows off some gameplay and going over the game overall.Is the game perfect? No. Does it take us in the right direction for NASCAR games, I really do believe it does, and hopefully pulls us out of the hole we've been in the last few years.

												The graphics weren’t as good as the hype, and the game is extremely hard to play with a controller or keyboard. You need a wheel to play this game without wrecking. (And even people who've played with the wheel are complaining) I've changed the sensitivity settings to the lowest, and the controller is just so sensitive. Definitely not impressed, but I think the PS4/Xbox version will be much, much better. Don’t purchase the PC version unless you have a wheel. The steering is so HORRIBLE, it’s so choppy. The steering is not smooth at all! (I cannot stress this enough!) The actual feeling of the car is laggy, the car feels slow, and heavy. The game has no sense of speed when you drive around the racetrack. The FPS is horrible when I’m running in full 2560 x 1440 resolution (this computer can definitely handle the game, so I know it’s not the computer) Also, when you're racing there isn’t any information on the screen. You can either view fuel, tires, or speed on the track. (Only one at a time. For example, you cannot view your lap times and tire information at the same time, you must toggle the display.) This might be a user error, as I haven’t been able to play but 30 minutes. 30 minutes is enough. I'm done with this game. I don't think this game is worth $60.00, or even $20.00 in all honesty. Don't take the risk like I did, read the reviews and don’t purchase the PC version.Please excuse any grammatical or syntactical errors, it’s almost 3:00 AM and I'm not proof reading.

												Not a bad single player arcade style game but Multiplayer is dead. The game is very barebones......no cutscenes, no leaderboards, no online cautions, no keyboard support, no league options, no paint booth. The challenges are ok ...some are really easy and others are insane.... like having 2 laps to go through the entire field at Watkins Glen and 4 laps to go through the field at Richmond. There are many challenges that are very unrealistic forcing you to drive like a madman and out of control. Career is better than Nascar15 but the cars still bump you off the track or into the wall. In sim mode the cars are really sensitive and the slightest bump will send you flying off the track or into the wall...and forget about touching the apron....If you get one tire down there around she goes. I have mostly reverted back to playing Nascar15 and more recently Project CARS. If only they would fix all the bugs in 15 we would have a half descent Nascar Game to play.			",3,5,4,1,1,0,0

												Make no mistake, this is an arcade racer. If your looking for a Sim, look for iRacking. Regardless, I'm 90 minutes in and loving it. I did the simple single player races and they were ok. Somewhat typical. I jumped into the multiplayer just to see and spent most of my time in there. I was surprised I had so much fun in there. No bugs. It's flawless for me so far. Graphics aren't awesome yet they are pretty good. I love the challenge mode and can't wait for more. I'm running a GTX 1080 at 4k with everything maxed out and getting 60fps. Works perfectly with my Steam Controller :) I see where they need some more work but there is so much potential here. I hope they develop further as I can see that this game can become even better.

												Using a Thrustmaster T300RS the racing is great. I use the default settings for my wheel and that seems to work best. FFB is good but I would like a little more feel for loss of traction.First thing you need to do is set the game for simulation and go to cockpit view. For some reason the AI cars don't look as boxy in cockpit view.Put this in simulation mode and the physics are better than the original Heat and MUCH better than the ETX versions. I am not going to say this is better than NR2003 but the racing against the AI seems more exciting to meBAD: In 1080p there are lots of flashing textures in the distance especially. Changing my AA settings in Nvidia Control Panel does not seem to help. This looks SO, SO much better in 1440p with those flashing textures much less noticeable.It took me a while to figure out what buttons on the wheel do what in the menu. This game needs mouse support.Seems not all wheels are supported yet.AI will be slow for a few races.			",53,0,23,0,1,2,2

												I had very high hopes for NASCAR Heat Evolution, and unfortunately I'm not very pleased with it. Yes, the physics are better than previous NASCAR games, and it does look quite good, but it's just not aimed at the gamer who wants a real simulation experience. The graphics in this game aren't too bad, though they aren't quite up to todays standards. The draw ahead and behind distances aren't very good, and even running in the highest of quality, the only things that look really nice are the things in your immediate surroundings. Everything else just looks kind of mediocre, like I'm back playing the Nascar Thunder titles on my PS2. It doesn't have the atmosphere of those games though; as hard as you try, you just can't seem to fully absorb yourself in the experience. It's still much like the nascar games of the past few years; trying it's hardest to be a NASCAR experience, but falling flat down to a passable arcade game. It's very arcade feeling, even in simulation mode, and it really just doesn't live up to all the hype. While it does look good, the feel of it isn't everything that it was supposed to be. The cars are very, very tight in normal mode, and the only difference in Simulation mode is the fact that it's much easier to break loose when coming in contact with anything. The cars are still just as tight, even with heavy modification to the setup. In my opinion, it doesn't live up to games like NR2003 or Iracing. Even the Forza 6 Nascar Extension was more fun to play than this game. After 3 hours of playing, tweaking, frustration over wheel support, I've finally come to a verdict.  If you're an arcade racer or a NASCAR fan, you'll love this game. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a casual racing experience. The multiplayer is also very good compared to many other previous titles, so if you're just looking for that, then I'd also recommend this to you.  But if you're a serious sim racer, looking for the most realistic experience and the best time while racing, I'd unfortunately have to tell you to pass on this game. It had really good potential, but the gameplay along with the lack of much racing wheel support will leave a bitter taste in the mouth of any NASCAR sim racer. I had high hopes for this game, but I'm sorry to say it really isn't worth the $59.99 price tag. It's a shame too; I really, really wanted to like it.			",3,0,3,0,2,0,0

												Probably the worst NASCAR game to have ever been released. What an absolutely horrible game. I wasn't expecting a simulation by any means, but this is garbage. The cars handle like crap, the AI has no regard for anyone and the spotter must be watching somone elses car because he'll tell you that you're clear when you're 3 wide. Save your money. The price tag on this game is an absolute joke. I remember playing Nascar Heat 2002 for XBOX. That game was lightyears ahead of this garbage. I truely believe the developers of this title took the frameword from the 2002 game and made it worse. Rant over. See for yourself if you want.			",0,0,4,0,2,0,0

												This game is far from perfect but I'm having a super good time with it so far.  There have been a few times with technical problems that cause the game to crash after the race, but hasn't been consistent to the point of frustration.  It's one of those games that bridges the gap between sim and arcade, and works perfectly for what this game is trying to be which would mean that it isn't recommended to anyone that is looking for an experience similar to iRacing.  I have solely been playing the single player career so far which has been a lot of fun, despite the bare-bones nature of it.  Definitely enjoying it a lot more than I did with NASCAR '14.  The AI seems to be better than average.  The other drivers are aggressive but not in a destruction derby sort of way that is common in a lot of racing games.  Overall, I think there are definitely improvements that can be made to the game, but for being the first entry in the series from a new studio, I think they're definitely on the right track.

												Good overall job DMR.  No lauch issues plays great!Only couple  complaints's first  to be able to adjust seat while in cockpit view.I  personlay need the force feedback upped a liitle bit even if its a 5-10% boost.I think that'll do. I have force feedback maxed out in this game and its about equal to iracings 7-10%.I might be a little generous there too with 10%.I have thrustmaster tx base & th8a shifter works great .Also I'm running 58?? X 1080 resolution triple monitors @ 65 fps. Looks great no problems here at all , max settings . One thing don't compare this game to iracing (iracing's much more expensive and the best muti - player racer..) its a nice change of pace to iracing . My main concern about this game was .."" how is the car gonna feel on the track ??  ( I don't believe they laser scanned these tracks but if they did I don't think we'd get 23 of them for 60 bucks either.Now I'd say its better than what forza 6 did with thier nascar expansion ( which I have) & theirs no track feel on those ovals ( get low in those turns nothing ).There is some road texure here / gass , groves but the its just not that strong. It is there though.To me the game is worth the 60.00 you get a game that to me had played without one single issue, looks great , career mode , 23 tracks.  Triple monitor support , multiple controller support ( tx base and th8a shifer)I might have to call it a simcade but not by much. I mean its close , just i little more DMR just a little more.Also I'm using gtx 1080 and i5 6500 , 16 gb ram			",4,3,16,1,7,0,5

												Pros: -- It is a fun game for both fans and casual gamers- 105% is pretty difficult for the NASCAR fans- Hitting the wall isn't a dead halt like the previous NASCAR games on PC- The HUD doesn't take much space-- Better ai than previous NASCAR games on PC- The ai actually try to make tough moves on you when you come up and try to come back down to block- The ai is pretty aware to where you are on the trackNeither Con nor Pro: - It's pretty hard to move someone out of the way but if you try at the right area at the right time you can shove them a bit.Cons:- The ai is pretty crash resistant and it seems as your car is a feather to crash when cars slam you; cars slam you yet some don't even crash- No replay to see what made a caution- The game controls your car right after a caution comes out- It's pretty easy to pull off a top 15-top 20 finish with 20 or so laps (I done Atlanta) on 105% difficulty, although the bit of tire wear near the end makes you lose a medium spotVERY MINOR Cons: -- Can't move up and down on results/q results leaderboard-- Not many paint schemes to choose from with base game, and even with the free scheme DLC there's not that much to choose from if your not much of a fan with any of the Toyota drivers.Things that NEED to be fixed:- Cars/Player(You) sometimes crash and the caution doesnt come out- Game takes control of your car when you or the ai are in mid-crash; 9/10 the game controls your car and slams into the wall or an oncoming car- In Qualifying, when you simulate ai or back out the game has your car take off and doesnt even exit the pits correctly- The ai is able to go on the apron without much reaction.VERY MINOR fix but it doesn't ruin much of the game- In Qualifying, when you are done the game controls your car and 9.5/10 times the game slams your car into the wall.Things I don't like in-game so far:-- VERY difficult to pull off a green flag stop at some tracks;ex. Atlanta---The main problem that I faced was a bet of FPS loss especially at tracks with big grandstands and a decent amount of stuff along with 40 other cars; ex. Daytona, AtlantaOverall: 7.5/10Very fun for a NASCAR fan like me, but if you can't put up with some of the cons/minor cons this isn't for you and you can play some other NASCAR game, and the people hating on the game just to hate on it need to go away.

												Thank you Steam for refunding this for me. Terrible game! I raced IRacing and NR2003 and this does not compare to those games. Not even close. The NPC's are unpredictable. I am often crashed on the backstretch because the computer decides to suddenly change lines, for some reason. The physics are unreliable with the car jumping from loose to tight in situations that it should not be. The features of this game look awesome and was the reason for buying. But it does not matter what the features are in a racing game if the racing is simply unplayable. If you are looking for an arcade smash-them-up game, then perhaps this is the game for you. For experienced sim racers, steer clear!			",33,3,9,18,27,0,16

												Don't get me wrong I think this game is pretty well done. It has online racing, 23 tracks, and plenty of drivers. a good game. if you are looking for a fun ""arcade style"" racing game this one is for you.However there are a few issues that kinda sent it back from the previous NASCAR '15 Victory Edition. Like no Paint Booth which means no custom schemes :(. Also no Photo mode which is very dissapointing considering how well done the off track details are on this game. Also comparing Online modes to previous installations of the NASCAR there is no options for cautions which is terrible considering that this isn't much of a sim which means more younger players and in turn means when there is online races... don't expect a clean race. Now with limited popularity on steam does limit the amount of time you can get with online racing because of the few servers and players who do Multiplayer stands a few interesting concepts that are being left out like...1. Online Leagues2. Cautions and Mid-Game Kicks/Bans3. Invitations via SteamIn conclusion this game is not like the other NASCAR games however is a much easier and balanced game which means more people can play it and have success however for the Sim racers this title is not for you			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												NASCAR heat evolution is a great game!  The AI is fun and competitive in any type of game mode.  The graphics aren't the best but it's very effective to the game's picture.  Having a set up featured on controls does help a little bit but it doesn't support all controllers, I'd recommend using the Steam controller or an Xbox 360 controller, it's a real shame that the keyboard and mouse cannot be used for racing.  But I think the developers of the game are working on it.  I recommend this game to NASCAR fans, controller users, and Steam link users.  Just don't listen to the other negative reviews, you will enjoying the game just like me.			",10,0,3,0,7,0,1

												Drafting needs alot of help. Can be on the bumper of a car and it will NOT go faster.  Running single car is almost 10 mph quicker.... it should obviously be the other way aroud.  Will try again in a few months when they have had more time to tweak and tune.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I always try to find the good in every NASCAR game I have ever played but I am hard pressed to find redeeming qualities in this one. I was looking forward to this game for a while but this lousy excuse for a racer feels like it belongs on a smartphone. This game is just flat out no good. Any previous year of Nascar is better. Please stay away fans and newcomers alike. So disappointed.			",50,1,2,3,0,0,1

												Switching my recommendation .. Will actually recommend this based on the latest patch which was only 12.5mb.  I can now use my Ferrari 458 Italia wheel. Way smoother car drives less sluggish than when used as an xbox controller..  Just noticed 3 races into my season I now have an option for Career Race Settings.  Since I only have one part upgrade I switched AI difficulty from Normal to Easy so i can make some money for shop upgrades.. As I get better equipment I shall up the difficulty.. Can increase race length upto 100% I imagine but set mine to 13%.  Turned Flags to FULL.   Now if we can only get these options for when you create a multiplayer lobby.  I'm hoping they do more with more patches to come.  Judging by one 12 mb patch, I'm very optimistic.  I feel like I didn't fully explore all the options in main menu.  found out you can pick your driver and change paints schemes (for those of us with DLC content) by hitting x.. you can either do a quick race or back out and go multiplayer with the same paint scheme.. Right now only problem I show other than lack of race customization in online lobbies are wreckers with no communication means to ID troublemakers and get host to boot said troublemakers.. THERE IS A KICK FUNCTION.  problem is usually the host which you can't kick.  Again addition of Cautions to Online race would give us a Replay hopefully of the caution another easy way of IDing troublemakers. Everyone is grouping into one Hosted lobby.. if we can ID the host or others as troublemakers we could then go create our own lobbies and seperate the good, the bad and the ugly here.  I understand making career mode a priority as a lot would prefer to play this mode to start out with.  Hopeful in future updates they can make Multiplayer more enjoyable for those who like arcade and those into SIM LEAGUES.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It sure is better then the Nascar 14, 15 crap we had to suffer from, but it's far from perfect.I am happy to see that you can finally do a race of 100-200 laps without crashing every 5 laps. That said there is a lot of work left to erase some frustrations. The career mode is good but sponsorship mode is a bit soft, the Only good thing of Nascar 14, 15 got completely erased.Cars that smash you from behind in a straight line while having complete room on my left to pass.AI that does not pit after laps, but when green they pit 2 laps later as they need to fuel!In Martinsville for example I was 4th (career mode, simulation) when suddenly a car smashed me in the back, made me go sideways in the pit, I got black flagged for entering to fast!!! I restarted 26th, but then another car hit me i got sideways to a full stop! NO YELLOW FLAG! But then suddenly all AI cars we're going soooooo slow i could lap them all once then they started to speed up again.Also No manual pitting, no manual drive under yellow. Nascar is not just driving it is a fight in the pits too!No configuration of car before racing in arcade modeThis kind of things should not be happening and should be seen if they bothered testing it. I Like the game but this frustration things are upsetting me especially if you drive at 25-50% of race lenght!They also never heard of TrackIR, as it would be much simplier to quickly look when driving inside cam. Because the spotter... well yeah he is there but man oh man it's not really good.Oh and each time you want to download a freaking  dlc the game starts! Another absurd bug!I would say the game deserves a 5/10 now if all those things could be fixed or added it would probably get a 8/10, so I am gone vote no until then.It is a nice try but you are Miles away from the NR2003 and the promised amazing game it was gone be.

												I feel like a lot of these reviews are making the game out to be a completely broken mess.  However, after playing just a couple of hours, I can see where the complaints are coming from.  The sound is sub par; the graphics are sometimes glitchy; and the presentation is underwhelming.  That being said...I'm having a blast playing this game!  The AI is an incredible improvement over the last few NASCAR games, and the career mode is challenging and engaging.  Are there other things I wish this game had? Sure (paintbooth, modability, better multiplayer options), but this is a solid game and a great platform for the future of NASCAR games.			",147,17,9,20,16,1,14

												Not the worst PC game I've ever played by any means. Certainly not the best, either. Definitely room for improvement in terms of driveability, physics, sound, graphics and functionality.If you're expecting this to be a simulator when you buy it, you'll be greatly disappointed because it is far from it.That said, there is some fun to be had with it to. I'm halfway through my first season in career mode and have enjoyed it thus far for the most part. The AI cars seem to be set up really well and I haven't experienced them just trying to wreck me as I've seen in other games.I'll continue doing my serious racing on iRacing though. Overall, I'll give the game a 3.5 out of 5.			",1,0,3,0,8,0,0

												Yes it may have been overhyped, yes it might be pretty disappointing that it's not as good as it seemed like it was going to be, but theres still a lot of fun to be had here. Whether or not it's worth a 60$ price tag is up to you, I personally think it should've been around 30$ at release, but I'm sure I'll get my moneys worth over time.Issues I had were that the DLC on day one sould've been included in the game in the first place, but so many other games do the same thing that I'm not really surprised this happened. So if you want what the full game should have been, then that'll run you about 90$. Very sad that the devs did that. Also the superSpeedways don't seem to have the pack racing like the last few NASCAR games have had, which was disappointing.So far I haven't run into any issues that I've seen other people have, like the crashing at Texas or frame drops, they might have been patched out, I'm not really sure, but take those into consideration as well when looking to buy this.I think the game is real solid overall, it certainly seems like it could've used a bit more work before release, but it's still a great arcade style NASCAR game.

												I came into this game optimistic about what it could be, but it definitely isn't that. Here's a quick rundown:Pros: -GREAT AI-Fun -Loads Quickly-Challenges-Career-HUD-Decent yet arcade style feel to the cars.Cons:-Terrible, circa 2001 sound.-Graphics are from 2007 at best.-Hard to spin other drivers.-Can't rotate camera.-Poor wheel and controller support.-Periodic crashing.So what we should have here is a decent and fun arcade racer for the $30-$40 range. What we have is a somewhat fun racer, that is overshadowed by the fact that it costs $60 and is not worth anywhere close to it. Wait for the price to come down, and some updates, then buy it. It's a good basis, it just misses the mark of being truly good for $60. ",56,2,4,10,15,0,25

												I really tried to love it I really did as i was so hyped for this damn game but after doing a few seasons and spending quite abit of decent time with it I just can't :(  the game just feels awfully rushed and barebones I would go into detail on why but if you scroll through reviews plenty of other people have already written why its not as good as it could have been.It's a good basis for them to work on though and I really hope the next game is more like dirt to daytona with awesome graphics and ai but many times nascar games have failed me over the years so my hope isn't high... lol  I still find it crazy that the best offline nascar experience is nr2003! its 2017 damn it!It's a shame i can't set the review to neutral  though since as a casual arcadey racer it isnt too bad tbh, alot better than the last few games what came out in my opinion. And I do want to support monster games since i feel like they were forced to rush it out and could do a much much better job if given the right amount of time and resources.I give it a 6 and a abit out of 10			",144,17,9,31,12,1,6

												Although the game may seem a bit incomplete, it has a lot of potential. It took some time to get my Thrustmaster wheel configured. However, once I dialed in the settings I enjoy racing offline and online.Here are a few items this game needs in order to feel complete:-Drafting seems a bit unrealistic. Should be able to close up on cars faster and have more momentum to pass people online. Two cars should quickly catch one car, and that simply does not happen.-Paint booth-There are a lot of features from previous NASCAR games that are missing online. Like keyboard chat, adjusting setups, spectacting, replays, more host controls.The career mode has a lot to offer and is a nice get away from online play. I haven't fully unlocked all the upgrades in career mode, but I have noticed that the AI tends to be much faster and the AI cars handle way better. So, I'm hoping that my car gets faster as I upgrade it through the career mode.Trust me, when I first installed this game and ran into issues I wanted to quit. However, I managed to grind through these issues and I'm glad I did as this game is becoming addicting! ",5,0,1,2,1,0,0

												The game certainly has potential, and if you can ignore the current issues the racing can be fun, but IMO the publisher does not deserve a positive recommendation for an unfinished PC release (even after three patches, little has changed).I'll check again after some significant performance updates.Unfinished and unoptimized port, unimpressive restart for DMR.EDIT:There has been practically no support beyond the **critical** controller config tool.DMR has lowered the price from EUR 59,- to 45,-We can expect the same treatment as with N2015, no more support and soon the price will be dropped to a predictable USD 9,99 until they pull it to make place for the next installment - probably a reskin.Black Flag for DMR...

It is nothing like it was hyped to be... I understand it wasnt supposed to be a true sim, but it did say drivers of all experience, from beginners to veteran racers... At max setting, the AI is still sloooooooooow! You can see them corner pretty good, but they still top out a few mph slower than my car most times easily... Poor, and will need some MAJOR work to get even close to what I expected with their own self serving hype...

												As a past NASCAR Heat racer back on NH2000 on PC and a current iRacer I can say these things; 1. The game lags excessively. I get better FPS running at higher settings in iRacing. 2. Original game had more features. (minus career mode)3. No online setups4. racing with a wheel and it might as well be a joystick it is so linear. 5. $60 is a steep price for a retextured game made 16 years ago; which BTW the source code they use is free as released by Hasbro.6. Any sim racer worth his salt will get bored quickly.Positives:1. Net code is good but it was good back in 2000; no improvement2. Fun online but will get old very quickly3. Good for the casual PC gamer.			",55,2,11,5,8,0,12

There are some areas where the game is lacking in depth, however they hit all the most important parts that make the game enjoyable for me. Pros:-Career mode feels like you're slowly building up a new team from the ground up.-Driving feels much better than Nascar '13, '14, and '15.-Online play works well and has been a ton of fun.-Game loads really fast.Cons:-Lack of paint scheme customization.-Some options are confusing or hard to find.-No caution replays to see what happened.-Pitstops are skipped rather than played through in Career Mode			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There are a few other problems, like that when you hit a wall, either you bouce off or just spin like a top, or that the grass is really bouncy, but there are some good things about it, too. There actually is drafting (you can feel it too), I found the career mode fun, there are different options on kinds of racing, which mode, etc., some drivers are good at certain tracks, it is good quality, and much, much, more.

												I am not reccomending this game because it is not worth $60 its not even $30 its a twenty dollar game topsIts no wonder the world laughs at Nascar when they have games like this recreating the sport In arcade mode it is a highly enjoyable single player wreckfest that should have been left in 2002 in Simulation it turns into a very poor representation of the Nascar 2016 season but the very thing its meant to be a car racing simulation it fails miserably to be Allow me to elaborate ,the game itself is quite an intense battle around 23 ""replicated"" but not acurate Nascar tracks between yourself the player and 39 AI drivers of differing quality ,so what ever your standard you will find either an equal opponent on the track or the AI will find ways to slow you down  However the car driving part is as a refined as trying to write your name in glass using a 14 pound sledgehammer ,using the brake even delicatley will cause your front end to dip and your car to slide sharp left like your wheels have just hit a stubborn elephant ,and cover your car in a cloud of smoke like your Cheech & Chong that would be fine as a novelty but in the middle of a race with cars on the track as you can well imagine would make seeing where you are going quite difficult ,the steering itself even with a wheel is very unprecise like peeling grapes with a dull rusty spoonAll of the above is fine in Arcade mode as your car seems impossible to spin ,but once you go into simulation mode the slightest touch from another car your spinning ,it works well on Superspeedways but for anything under 1and a half miles where you have to use a slight bit of break and you break early or your slow out of a turn ,your rear ended and turned ,that in it self doesnt sound too bad ,except the caution flag wont come out(if it does at all) untill the entire pack of cars following has slammed into you spun you around and flipped you overThere are several other features that have been sadly over looked too ,like the ability to skip a race in career mode ,The fact you as a driver cannot look left or right (where the hell have the game designers been for the last 10 years to not have this feature in?)Multiplayer has no chat voice or text ,so if your looking to race and have some laid back fun with other humans i suggest going out ,as this multiplayer just feels like your playing against AI with poor internet connectionsin summation STEAM SONY & MICROSOFT all need to look closely at thier business practice`s for allowing this game to be sold at $60			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I decided to give this a try despite the reviews. If you are a pro-sim racer looking for advanced realism in a nascar ""sim"" - this is not for you.  The AI are weak, the feedback is weak, and even though the game recognizes a 900 degree wheel -  the car ingame only computes approx 180 degrees of that (made for controllers, not wheels).Rather just got for the stock car mods in RFactor - having hardly any Nascar Licensed tracks is still better than abysmal car handling and lack of a true ""simulator"" mode.

												Seemed OK, didn't support my wheel. Physics didn't feel that great on simulation mode. Another difficulty would be nice, support for my wheel, among other things. Very reminiscent of the old 2000 released title NASCAR Heat - in a good and bad way. I am a long time player of the original, so it was refreshing to see a game true to its roots, but dissapointing to basically see the same game rehashed with better graphics and worse controller support.

												All of the negative feedback was from the initial launch. Ever since then they've released a patch to help controller support and it works like a charm. A really fun game to pick up and drive. Graphics look good, despite everyones complaints. They don't make or break a game, the actualy gameplay depicts that, and it's beautiful.			",43,3,20,2,8,1,7

												This game is getting way too much hate. It does the most important things well and it is fun. The ETX games were broken, to say that this game is worse is absolutely not true. The ai in this game is worth the price alone. You get competent, and competetive races with real battles, offline. It may not have all the bells and whistles, and it may take time to patch and get everything working properly, but if you are looking for a good offline race on official NASCAR tracks against a 40 car field with the current set of rules and drivers, you can get it here.

												It's not the very best, but it's ok. For me as a huge NASCAR fan it was absolutely clear that I would buy it when DMR announced NASCAR Heat Evolution. I expected a little bit more ( e.g. better feeling in the car, Xfinity Series and Camping Truck Series), but it's not as bad as everyone says. I bought it during Steam Winter Sale for about 30$, and that was worth it ( in my opinion).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: October 8, 2016
												It's great to see a NASCAR game back on the gaming scene. I have found this game to be quite fun. Let me preface that statement with the fact that I am a racing sim fan. If you are not into racing games, then perhaps this may not be a good fit for your gaming library. Outside of the small bug of the game crashing to the Steam screen when I click ""Chase Grid,"" I have had great success with the game operating well. Although this is my experience alone. I have only spent a little under 17 hours in the game but I want to detail below a few things that are appealing to meThe vast upgrade I have found most appealing with this itteration of the sport is the AI. I actually feel like I am trying to fight for positions on the track. In past racing sims I found the competition to either be too easy or too hard. It was extremely hard to find a good balance. Not so in this game...at least in my experience. In past games I found AI backing out of the gas as you would get closer with side by side racing. It seems to me that the AI actually does fight you for the positions. Sometimes they give and sometimes they don't (Listen to your spotter or you could see yourself spinning on the track).I also feel the graphics are fine for this type of game. Granted I am running everything on the highest setting, but for me in a racing sim; fps is big over graphics necessarily. I think this game has good balance of graphics and fps.I have only briefly tested the challenge mode but it was fun as well. It reminds me of the NASCAR Heat series from years back when they would put you in scenerios such as the ""big one"" at Talledega.All in all, if you are a NASCAR fan and racing fan...you may enjoy this game. I encourage you to check out reviews and videos online to see what you think before your purchase.			",474,121,3,58,20,4,20

												Ok, I can slightly understand the negative reviews but not much. This game is actually so much fun. Those people who look at the negative reviews slamming this game I don't understand too much. The games graphics a actually really good. And I have an i5 computer. The challenges are awesome and carrer mode is good as well. My one concern is they promised that we can pick our own chase, you can't do that. I would add more challenges and add the ""pick your chase"" feature that they PROMISED. Either way, good game, highly recommended.			",4,0,2,1,2,0,0

												Despite not being THE best NASCAR game yet ever made, it has got a lot of potential... I'm waiting for future patches to fix/correct/add some things such as:- being able to watch race intros in Race and Championship mode to give us much more immersion- putting a key on the gamepad/wheel for us to be able to look back/right/left- putting more numbers available in Career mode- replacing our name in Race and Championship mode, for the one of the driver we are racing as (for example, if I'm racing as Kevin Harvick, I want the name on the leaderboard to be Kevin Harvick, not my name)- letting us watch the replays of accidents that caused cautions- tire wear must be noticeable (we can't be doing best laps after 6 or 7 laps with the same set of tires...)- fixing Martin Truex Jr. AI (he's way back all the time)- fixing the cautions (I caused a wreck fest at Martinsville and only 1 of the accidents got called out, this is ridiculous!)And please make the AI more aggressive (as to not seeing them sometimes back off), I don't know if it's me but does Speed Rating actually work? I have the AI set to Auto but they are still slow -.-Although I think the price is a bit exaggerated (having in mind there are paid DLCs), overall I'm pretty happy with the game considering it's Monster Games' first on next gen, the graphics are decent and it runs well on my PC. It's also better than ETX's games but that's just my opinion!			",1,0,2,0,0,0,0

												I was a little scared to by this game,with all the negative reviews. I play the game in single player,using a G27 wheel,the wheel works fine. I dont make pitstops I just race in single player with no flags. I like the AI you can use the outside groove ,pretty cool. I have difficulty set on 95, cut the wheel sensitivity down and it works fine. Is there anyway to toggle off the drivers names,didnt see anything for that. I think this game is going to be great once they iron out the bugs.			",33,0,8,0,0,0,0

												Game isn't terrible. However its not 45 pound/60 dollars worth of game.  Ai is fun to race, game could do with a save race feature and I am not a massive fan of adaptive ai which seems locked in on career mode.  Reason being it falls down if you pit earlier than the AI. As the game cannot figure it out so you end up blowing by everyone for a few laps and usually gain 4-6 places once the cycle is complete.The frameworks there and this is alot more promising than the recent console nascar efforts.  Hopefully they can build on what they have learn from what feedback they're getting and in a year or two we could have a very solid nascar game.			",37,15,8,10,6,0,2

												The game is better than the previous games. It actually runs really well, and looks better than the previous ones too. But here are things that should be changed:-Start the music right after you cross the finish line in a race, and not after the points standings (in career mode). It's awkwardly quiet.-Add more options for Anti-Aliasing. It should never be ""On"" or ""Off"" but rather ""Off"" ""x2"" ""x4"" ""x8"" ""x16"". If those could be added the game would look a whole lot better.-Add options for Draw Distance. There is this annoying ""Box"" on the track right in front of my car where things start to load in. It's annoying, and if this is added, the game will look better.-Allow all flags in career mode. I don't know why they are turned off, and can't be changed.-Increase rear-view mirror resolution. It looks terrible.-Add ability to look around the outside of your car during a race using the right analog stick.These things would change the game a lot and make it so much better too. But it is a good re-entry for DMR and I hope they can update this game a little more soon.			",52,5,2,8,7,0,8

												This game is great, it's not fantastic by any means, but the physics are decent and the online on PC has been really great.  A lot of solid drivers who will race you clean and hard, I really enjoy this game's small but solid community.  The AI is a bit bizarre on the plate tracks (as of 9/22/16), but on the short tracks and the 1.5s it's pretty fantastic.  They fight you hard for position, especially the top ten drivers.  Career mode makes you feel like you're really on a small, crappy single-car team. A 25th place finishing position could be a win for you and your team.  You slowly earn sponsors, who get you money to upgrade your race team.  It's all in all pretty decent for a first game, I'm looking forward to future iterations of this game on PC and I hope to see the community grow, I know I'll certainly be buying next years game too!PS:  Feel free to add me if you want to play sometime!

												I'll keep it short and simple. The game is not worth $60 due to the lack of features. A racing game at that price, such as Forza, should have way more features than just a career mode, a championship season, challenges, online mode, and normal racing.I'll agree that the game looks great for what it is and can be really fun. It's not the full NASCAR-sim experience, but I know I could have fun with it. I just can't recommend this game to anyone based on the price. It's as if it's incomplete game, to be honest.If you're interested in the game, give a 1-2 hour try. If you think it's not worth the $60, refund and play the waiting game like I'm doing.

												I took a chance on this based on the mixed reviews and I'm glad I did. Running on Nvidia 880m into matrox triplehead2go thru 3 24"" monitors. Playseat and g27 wheel. Excellent game. AI is challenging and Im enjoying the career mode. g27 is setup almost perfectly. Shifting and clutch function perfectly. I don't see why all the negative response to this game. Its not that bad. Yes the graphics are dated, but thats a good thing in my case, as Im able to run the game 5760 x 1080 on max settings. two thumbs up. If your a fan of nascar, this game is too good to not get. One downside is that it seems that the multiplayer servers aren't very active. Im playing career for now so not a issue for me.			",21,8,8,5,12,2,13

												I would have waited until Feb. to get a game that is finished.  The sound is terrible, the graphics are cartoonish, the smoke is a joke!  The crash model is no better than games from previous NASCAR games, the lack of in game wheel adjustments for my THRUSTMASTER T300 Racing Wheel Alcantara Edition is so sad.  I tried to give the game a shot, I could not get behind it.  Stop building DLC for your game and finish it.  Very disappointed, I was so excited for this game.			",218,40,29,31,90,3,87

												This is not a bad game.  It has flaws.  Daytona and Dega need to get fixed, but this game is far better than ETX.  If you're a fan of NASCAR and enjoy playing NASCAR games, then this is a solid game... If you want realism, maybe you should stay with iRACING.  But if all you want to do is pick up the controller (which is crazy hard on simulation, as it should be) and turn a few laps, or take a break from iRACING, I would say buy this game.  I like DMRs first relase, and it makes me feel optomistic for future titles.			",91,9,12,9,13,1,21

												1 day after launch. Go to multiplayer and there's 1 lobby total. LOL Sad, Had such high hopes. Nothing here but some broken dreams and a console port that doesn't do anything well. $60 down the drain. Tracks are mostly locked from the get go until you unlock them. Set ups for cars are not available to use online even if you could find races. Career mode sticks you with an underfunded team and requires you to unlock better sponsors and equipment as you play, before you can get competetive. My G-29 wheel buttons being PS instead of Xbone requires you to learn what button is he corresponding xblows1 button. Greaphics are made for consoles and don't deliver on my hardware that is much better than the consoles. 13 years later Nascar 2003 still looks beter and races better.			",21,4,13,1,7,0,10

												I really wanted to like this game. I miss the days of the seaira and papyrus sims and the ea arcade games. This just doesn't cut it. If it were $20 then it would be perfect, if it were $40 I could eventually forgive it. But $60 is too much for a game that is missing too much. I love NASCAR, mostly for what it once was, and I love NASCAR games but if you want to shell out $60 find a used copy of nr2003. Heck nr2002 is cheaper and it would still be better. I may buy later if price goes down but for now I'm gonna get a refund			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played this game for a very short amount of time, then requested a refund. Definitely is not worth $59.99 by any means. The gameplay was just complete junk, and in my own opinion I would say this is one of the worst NASCAR games made. This game was definitely over hyped for what it is and is majorly disappointing.

												I was very excited on this game and was hopeful that it would be a good game. It was developed by the people who made NASCAR Dirt to Daytona, one of the best NASCAR games, along side NR2003 and NASCAR Sim Racing. However, it was not forwishing, as the graphics was meh, the gameplay was generic, and the AI is beyond stupid. I can cut some slack to NASCAR 15, as it was pretty well handled, and the developers were more of a racing gamers (they made Ride to Hell).  I was unamuzed that I ran well at daytona, but after that, it was like god just cursed the game. I couldn't get by Atlanta, and after a while, I decided to just park in front of the stands...and no cautions. If THAT wasn't bad enough, I went to Vegas, got loose and caused a big wreck. Guess what happened? NO F***KING CAUTIONS! I had all flags on, and I was even black flagged for a very stupid reason, jumping the start. ♥♥♥♥♥, I was in last place and I fell backwards, HOW DOES THAT QUALIFY JUMPING THE START?!? Basically, after that I just flat out gave up, and in the process of getting a refund. I am disappointed to Monster Games. I was hoping lightning strike twice for them. Not this time. I hope that if they work on the next one, it would be, at least, PLAYABLE and ENJOYABLE, otherwise, I might give up buying new NASCAR Games all together.Graphics: 6/10Gameplay: 3/10AI: 2/10Enjoyment: 1/10Overall: 3/10			",14,0,2,0,15,2,1
