												Some games take hours before a decision can be made. Some take just minutes. Some games are glorious. Some...... some are just hideous.Ducati World Championship is the most putrid, plagueridden piece of decomposed penile tissue I have had the misfortune to review. I wish that was hyperbole. It's the gaming equivalent of lutefisk. I'm sure someone, somewhere enjoys this game, that someone probably lives in a dark cave, and lives on a diet of raw fish. They probably want to know what I have in my pockets.This game is often bought as a gag gift, for good reason, it's cheap, usually less than a euro or a dollar, it has a horrible metacritic rating, sub 30's, and like another gag gift, bad rats, it's an odious piece of garbage. The stink of sewage can be sensed long before the game has had the chance to imprint its' accursed signature upon your hard drive, and believe me, once it has, uninstalling it will be something you follow with religious rituals. You may need to burn the hard drive and scatter the ashes somewhere sacred, just to make sure the game doesn't come back from the dead. The store video promises that we'll be in for a treat, giving us glorious footage of a badly rendered CGI woman who wears what looks like two strips of shiny gaffer tape over her wobbly bits to ensure that the video doesn't get an R rating, and only occasionally a look at the bikes in what is a bike racing game, all the while subjecting us to some hideous ""rawk"" music (and the music follows you into the game, it gets worse, it's musak, it's musak for videogames).But wait, it gets better. This horrific satanic mutation requires you to delve into the install folder and set it to compatibility mode, if you're in windows 7, and not what you'd expect. Normally compability means XP. NOT SO here, dear reader. Nope, here, it's compatibility for windows Vista.Let's pause to consider this. A game that requires windows vista compatibility. Windows Vista. The Operating System from hell. In case you needed any clearer a signpost, this is it, this is ""Abandon hope all ye who enter here"", and hope is quickly extinguished. The resolution caps out at 1680x1050, which for current day computers means you're going to be upscaling to get it to fit onto 1920x1080, it's filled with some horrific motion blur, the graphics would look modern on an Atari Jaguar. Yes, that -thing-. That dared call itself a console back when the original Playstation was owning face back in the day.The control system is poorly documented, and was designed by someone who had no idea how racing game controls SHOULD work and probably didn't CARE. Requiring you to fumble about like some poor sod in the dark hunting for the light switch in the bathroom whilst trying not to urinate all over the floor, when you do finally figure out what keys make the bike actually -go- in the relevant directions you find that there's zero smoothness in the response, the bike literally slides over the course like it's 1989 and we're playing ENDURO RACER ON THE ***KING SINCLAIR SPECTRUM WITH TAPE LOADING GAMES. ARE YOU HEARING ME? A SODDING 128K MACHINE DID A BIKE EXPERIENCE BETTER THAN YOUR ***KING DUCATI ***KING WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP YOU ***KING USELESS ***KING ***KERS.*ahem*I'm trying not to completely lose my temper here. I know that the programmers probably tried their best, and that people invested time and effort... oh who am I trying to kid, this is shovelware. It's the lowest of the low. It's frothing knobcheese of the most torrid variety and like Bad Rats, only barely qualifies as a ""game"" and only qualifies as ""entertainment"" if you're looking to put up youtube videos of you suffering through playthroughs to give other people a cheap laugh. If that's something you want to do, go ahead, be my guest. BE MY ***KING GUEST. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? I QUIT. ***K THIS GAME. ***K THIS ***KING GAME. NO MORE. I WILL PLAY THIS NO MORE. IT WILL TAKE UP NO MORE OF MY TIME AND NO MORE OF MY HARD DISK. I CONSIGN THEE TO THE FIRES OF HELL AND MAY IT BURN THERE FOREVER MORE....And if you really need to ask? No. No I do not recommend this ""Game"".			",1647,571,92,264,280,18,321

												I was excited to find a pc game that ran on legacy hardware and had single pc splitscreen, but after playing motocross madness and road rash, I felt this game came short in a lot of areas. I remember the controls playing like super hang on and everything else about it just wasn't worth the 5 dollar price tag. If you are looking for some weekend fun you can grab this for $1 or $.50 on the christmas deal, but buy it regular price and you will be disappointed.			",571,65,50,41,62,5,68

												Bahahaha! This game is definately worth 50 cents.  No way to exit a race.  You use Q to go forward, but the arrow keys to turn.  The soundtrack is some orchestral chick rock band. I think their Janitors decided to make a game, and then decided they had better things to do and outsourced this game's development to a couple 8 year olds in somalia, who were using a Pen and paper flipbook made of hippo toenails to program.  I've lost more money in my couch than this game cost, and I still would rather have just thrown 50 cents into a river.			",158,16,3,13,6,3,25

												This game is not nearly as bad as everyone says. The handling takes some getting used to, the commentary is best when it's turned off and the game is best played with a 360-pad along with the knowledge that the P-key brings up the in-game menu which you can use to exit or restart races.The game has several modes, including a career mode, championship and a challenge mode. The championship is a pre-determined series of increasingly difficult races, the challenge mode tasks you with performing various timed trials such as wheelies. The most interesting mode however is the career mode, which has you competing in a variety of race types while working your way through several license classes.You get to create your own racer for this mode and you earn new bikes by completing races. These new bikes allow you to enter even more races and once you've completed all of them, you move into the next class - the goal being to eventually win The Race Queen - the girl from the intro.The races can be as simple getting to first place within two laps, to a multi-stage endurance race where your performance carry over between stages, meaning your bike or even your character can become beat up over time. You can enter the pit stop to allow either your character or your bike to recover. You also gain nitro by racing well. Staying on the road gives you a slow but steady build of nitro that you can use when you need a boost, driving outside the road will drain the meter quickly, and performing stunts such as wheelies will make it rise dramatically. The visuals for this game are quite old-fashioned but they did employ the RenderWare engine for the game and it does a good job of maintaining a smooth frame-rate with no pop-ups to be seen anywhere. The stages are pretty varied too, with plenty of locales like arenas, deserts, tropical, mountain- and country-side tracks -  and in some of them you can literally see for miles into the background.If you like classic arcade racers (especially those made by Sega and Namco) and don't mind old-school graphics, taking chances with low budget titles and dealing with an initially harsh learning curve - then this game might be for you.

												Once in awhile comes an artist with a vision so distinct that it has the power to crystallise the voice of an entire generation. Artematica, creator of Ducati World Championship, is such an artist.Ducati World Championship is a game that innovates the racing game genre. The gameplay is simple to comprehend yet truly shows and rewards mastery of the gameplay mechanics, with crisp and fluid controls to boot. The graphics, while seemingly outdated, provide a powerful and immersive asesthetic that makes the player feel as if they are actually in the game. The scenery is breathtaking in its simplistic beauty with vivid and evocative colours. The soundtrack is incredible with unique and ground-breaking orchestral pieces that truly inspire passion and wonder. The story is a gem not seen in videogames, period. The story maintains a realistic nature while exploring thought-provoking questions that have plagued society for ages, possibly since the dawn of man. The characters are relatable with interesting idiosyncrasies that truly make them seem real and relatable. Character development and depth is common theme throughout the story.In short, Ducati World Championship is a magnificent, towering achievement for video-games, it's unique, creative, and memorable. If you haven't purchased this game, you are not only hurting yourself, but those around you.			",9,0,1,0,0,0,1

												Ducati World Championship blew my♥♥♥♥♥♥off.Seriously. It placed its exhaust pipe to my pipe and blew it clean off.You'd be forgiven for thinking this is just a mere racing game, but the underlying plot is one of gripping suspense and subtle romance.At the new game selection, you're told to pick a girl to race with. Be extremely careful in doing so, for picking anything but a caucation female will make the romance part of the game a real challenge.After that, the story slowly unfolds and you'll find yourself moved to tears as you discover the true nature of the game. Not to win a simple bike race, nay, to discover your humanity.10/10 - Inspiring plot, interesting character development, a love story that shouldn't be ignored.			",146,19,2,15,26,1,26

												Are you completely bored and don't like interacting with friends? Then this game will help you pass the time. I've played 0.6 hours so far (weird way of writing time to be honest) and I'm probably never gonna play it again but I had fun. For 74p i cant even buy a bottle of coke, yet this was all I paid for his game. Probably wondering if you can play it from a remote control and you'd be right. So far I've figured out square is accelerate, X, O, Triangle and L1 seem to be brake and R2 makes you look backwards but all you need is Square.

												This game is amazing, the multiplayer is so fun when you get 8 friends together, and the best part is that you can play online across the web with people from all over the globe!!!!WOWIm really anticipating the new DLC pack which comes out after new years, I have heard that it adds 11 new maps and 50 new bikes which all together adds hundreds of great, action filled high emersion hours. The story of this game is riviting, you start of with 10 dollars but you go and race and become the world champion with 10k dollars ( THATS ALOT!!! ) My one complaint is that its a very demanding game and my computer is not good enough to utilize the full capabilities of this amazing game. Overall I would personally rate it a 11/10 due to its replay factor, and I am surely gonna kick back and race some more dudes on Ducati for sure!			",118,8,2,11,7,0,6

												This game may be old with quite outdated graphics, but I have found it a nice distraction when playing with an Xbox 360 Controller. You will unlock new bikes and drivers via career mode, and all the other modes are interesting in their own ways. Yes, the controls are a little touchy, and a few of the bike setup options seem to make very little difference. The graphics are not pretty or up to date. But with that said, I've been having great fun with it. In career mode, you have driver health and motorcycle damage to keep in check. Almost every race so far in C Class has unlocked either a new bike or a new driver for Championship mode. While I haven't finished the game yet, I have definitely had great fun with what I have played. I usually play very modern driving games like Gran Turismo 6, GRID 2, MX vs. ATV, Motorstorm, etc. Despite it's very visual age, this game is still fun if you like to race. It is a bit strange and is sponsored by a specific motorcycle company. But the strangeness makes it charming and the Ducati sponsorship means great bikes to ride and unlock.Highly recommended for fans of motorcycle racing games, especially if you don't mind slighty better than PS1 graphics and controls. I think it's great, but your experience may vary.			",347,45,31,32,44,3,58

												Well the other reviews were spot on. If you pay a few quid or less than a dollar or whatever then it is to much. From bad graphics engine to poor handling of bikes that have some daft camera angles it is rubbish. I played a very short time, time wasted really, I then removed it from my PC. Would I recommend this? Not at all, it isn't even arcade feeling really, had better graphics on my Vic20! (Well it felt like it).If you want to play a motorbike game then the SBK series is the way to go or the MotoGP series, but stay clear of this, it is a waste of HD space.			",55,9,25,3,54,0,1

												If you are a fan of Ducati and or music buy Lacuna Coil by this when it is on sale.The bikes look nice enough and the tracks are interesting. It just starts to feel the same after a few races. I barely have a bike for 2 races before I'm onto the next bike, so I don't form any attachment. The bikes themselves don't have any upgrades.I finished the Class C championship before writing this review.TIP: You will need to run the exe in compatability mode on most modern PCs			",593,222,45,89,83,1,128

												This game should burn in hell. No one should buy this game, that aside, the gameplay is superb. Driving the motorbike feels like a dream, you know one of those dreams where you feel like your moving through molasses? The soundtrack is on par with such titles as Chrono Trigger and the early Final Fantasies, you have to love the same nauseating track blaring at you every race. But, by far, the most impressive thing about this game has to be its textures. The grass looks sooo real, as if you were looking at it through google maps. Anyway, I rate this game a 4/1 gorillian. I bought it for .74$ and it was worth every penny.			",3,1,1,0,1,0,0

												Ducatti World Championship is frankly an embarrassment to everyone involved, Lol the makers now make iOS and Facebook games.I would put this game up there with Bad Rats as it as a great gift to give to your friends that you dont really like but feel obligated to get a gift....or if you just want to be a massive troll and give someone a terrible game they can't get out of their library.
