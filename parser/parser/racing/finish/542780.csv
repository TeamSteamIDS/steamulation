												Pros:-Simple, it's easy fotr casual people to just pick up and go.Cons:-A turd is better optimized than this game.It's a game for casual people who just like to pick up a free game and have a go. It's not meant to be an ultrarealistic game for car enthusiasts (like myself).Yes the game does look like it was made in the year 2000 by soemone who just figured out 3d graphics but you shouldn't really judge a game by that.Conclusion is: It's free so why the ♥♥♥♥ not.

												I'm glad that I couldn't even pay a dime for this!As a mobile game doesn't mean that Steam gamers need it!Stay on mobile.- The physics are laughable- Same for difficulty, doesn't change anything- The graphics almost good, almost...(I have low requirements, playing Minecraft)...Just too ""sterile"". Fill it with life!  - pls, do not use depth of field that heavy!  - I have a PC way over the requirements, and the whole game is LAGGING!- 3 cars (+lots for teasing to play) and 1 track?...- What's with the gearbox and the engine sound?- Challenges are lie- Calcing drift points AFTER every crash? Is supposed to work like that?The only positive thing is: takes only 75mb disk spaceCheck out Drift Streets Japan (or JUR Japan Underground Racing), or if you can, Need for Speed Underground 2! Or GRID2 have Drift pack! But stay away from this! Unless after a huge revamp!10/10 i would dra...drift again			",1065,225,88,73,70,9,128

												Ehhhhh. It's a great way to waste time. With only a single track and mode to choose from, and only 3 vehicles with 7 others greyes out and no way to unlock it's very light on content. The gameplay is moderately OK. The cars drive like the entire track is an oil slick, it's not so much drifting as it is driving as fast as you can with something that has 0 control. With assists, the car is nearly undriveable as the game countersteers for you most of the way and lets you ride the line it makes, so if you're too slow or too fast by even 10kph you're in the wall because the track is so narrow. Fun, could be executed much better and honestly dissapointed. Better than most free racing games, however.			",34,4,2,2,6,0,4

												Drift GEAR Racing is a drift-track simulator offering the availibility to post your score to an online leaderboard.Pros:-Free, and extremely small download sizeCons:-Graphics are extremely dated, and do not prove to be extremely appealing.-Music and sound effects are mediocre and become annoying extremely quickly. Same engine sound for every car-This game calls itself a drift-track game, but there is no proper control of your vehicle, a slight touch sends the car out of control, and you fly high in the sky when you touch a wall at 30km/h.This ""game"" does not deliver. It is a frustrating and annoying representation of a game in this day and age. Not worth your time.1/10			",329,107,29,41,36,1,27

												This game is literally Garbage.Pros:-ChallengesCons:-Every time you turn you drift.-Going so fast that if there was a person in that car he'd be dead.-For those that use 2 monitors, it defaults to one monitor and you can't change it.-No sign of being able to Actually unlock cars.-There is only one track.

												INCREDIBLY ACCURATE This game is a very acurate racing/drifting simulation, similar to Assetto Corsa and Project Cars, but a lot better. The physics are true-to-life and the graphics are incredible. The crashing animations are very accurate, and so are the physics. For example, hitting a traffic cone head on sends you flying 30 feet into the air, causing catastrophic damage to the exhaust system and rear bumper, but leaving not even a scratch on the front end.Reccommend to everyone who like anything. Stop what you are doing and download this.			",37,6,4,2,10,0,1

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			",67,8,1,3,10,0,15

												A track based drifting game quite similar to High Octane Drift, but perhaps with a greater ability to control the vehicle. You  need to go through a slalom of barrels on the track, and don't forget to crash into the wall a few times.  The crowd are ""paper people"", which will detract from the realism for some, but good graphics and realism overall.Make up your own mind with this gameplay
