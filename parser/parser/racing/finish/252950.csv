												So, what makes this vehicular football game so great?- Great gameplay- Marvelous graphics- Very competitive- Alright singleplayer- Tons of customization- Easy to pick up, hard to master- Up to 4-player splitscreen (!!)- Cross-platform+ Much more to experience for yourself!Cons:- Servers were pretty bad to begin with, but that's fixed now tho', so this should not count as a con.Everything else that I would have written as a con, is currently being added, so I have no complaints about this game at all.''Just one more game'' - everyone.

Rocket League has one of the best progression systems I've ever seen in a video game before...Rookie - You can't hit♥♥♥♥♥♥ You are a disgrace to your team and the game.Semi Pro - You can now sometimes hit the ball. Don't even try to hit it in the right direction or think about your positioning. You're only Semi Pro so you can just go ahead and hit that ball! You also made a bicycle hit that one time but yeah nah you're still♥♥♥♥♥♥Pro - You have learnt how to shoot the ball accurately from the ground. You're the best! Late into Pro level, you would have likely looked up advanced tips for Rocket League. Worst mistake of your life. You now know what aerials are. You think you can fly. The ball comes up high and you go for an aerial. Once you jump, you fly straight into the ground and continue to do frontflips until you land on your back... What the ♥♥♥♥ happened there? Oh. You're using keyboard. Yeah nah, time to get a controller,♥♥♥♥♥♥head.Veteran - You now have a controller and go for terribly unlikely aerials. You think you're good. You can hit the lower aerials consistently and you can now be considered an addition to your team. Congratulations!Expert - You can now consistently hit aerials accurately at any height. This game is now your life. You can also score off a wall every now and then. Good times.Master - You are now a god to every level lower than you. You have perfected the art of wall shots. You are an extremely cool person. A nice little bonus is that everyone under the level of Pro will now spam ""Sorry!"" every time they do something wrong to you.Legend - The most badass-looking title you can have. ♥♥♥♥ Rocketeer. You probably now have an extreme case of false confidence. Once you get used to the badass title, you'll wreck anything and anyone with ease. You can also pull off freestyles consistently. Nice job! Also be sure to prepare for an endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Legend!""Rocketeer - You can now 720-freestyle-backflip-reverse-backwards-aerial-air dribble off a wall with ease. You probably boosted for that Rocketeer tag, but if you didn't: Still prepare for another endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Rocketeer!""But in all seriousness, I absolutely love this game and I'm sure anyone will.

├Professors Review┤Overall Score: 95/100Game Pros• Highly Addicting• Frequent updates• Split Screen Multiplayer • 60 FPS (Its capped, but unlockable if you really want more frames. But 60 is just swell)• Supports In-game voice/text chat• Low ping (Make sure to select your region in the server filters)• Clean Interface• Cross platform (Optional) • Smooth Gameplay • Customizable cars (You can even give them hats!)• In-game replay recorder (Just hit ""save replay"" after any match)• Incredible visuals• Crates (Unlock valuable items using microtransactions)• Diversity in game modes • Controller support (The game suggests to use a controller, but honestly, the keyboard works perfectly. All preference)• In game training editor (Create and practice your own shots!)Game Cons• ""Report"" button basically does nothingRelateable Games•  Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Power Battle-CarsConclusionRocket League is an amazing game. You know those games that you play while you should be going to bed? That's this game. Only 90 minutes into the game, and i've already had so much fun with it. I would honestly reccomend this game to anyone. Unless you REALLY hate soccer, and you simultaneously REALLY hate cars.(If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!)

												Rocket League is a perfect game for short breaks. 5 minutes of flying and exploding cars, then I can continue doing whatever I was doing before. (To be honest, it usually ends up in ""one more match"" multiple times. That's how it's good.)The game is easy to learn and just fun to play. Making the perfect aerial shot, passing to a goal, saving the ball from reaching your goal at the last possible moment, failing hard and scoring an own goal... These are all moments you will see in Rocket League.Are you in a mood for tactical game? Play 2v2. Do you want chaos? Play 4v4.I love car customization. Who doesn't want to have a car with sombrero and rainbow trail?

												Rocket League is less of a ""sports game"" and more of an actual sport. In FIFA or Madden you have a ""pass"" button, but to make a pass in Rocket League you have to drive your car into the ball at the right speed and angle to send it over to where your teammate is going. You have to create the pass yourself, and it can be anything, from a hard bounce off the back wall to a soft lob over the defender. Passing, shooting, dribbling, tackles, jukes, they're all in the game, but you  have to make them happen yourself, not just press the right button. At first, just driving car to ball is a challenge, but as your skill grows, the freedom to create any play you can imagine and execute is unlike anything you'll find in a ""sports game"". Together with the mechanical skill to do what you want with the ball, you'll have to develop positional awareness and learn proper rotation and game sense. There are very few games that are consistently rewarding for hundreds or thousands of hours, that can keep challenging you as you improve, and improve, and improve beyond what you ever imagined you'd be capable of. In fact, this is the ONLY one I know. Best.Game.Ever.			",205,58,3,30,55,4,36

												Edited as of: 21st July 2015 01:00Pros:+ Its a football/soccer game that contains rocket powered cars (added soccer because of americans).+ It is purely a skill based game and everything the player does matters.+ (in my experience) my game seems to run at a stable 60FPS after turning off the frame limiter.+ Graphics looking quite nice.+ PC, PS4 cross play is possible.+ Its easy to learn, Impossible to master.+ Ranking system currently works well with score gained or lost each match.+ There are a lot of friendly players in the steam community.+ Save replays after matches and edit them to your hearts content in the editor+ Full xbox 360/xbox one controller supportCons:- PS4, PC cross parties are currently non-existant- You can unlock a lot of things in such a small time, I'm level 20/30 and I have 100% of the items- Some people have crashing issues (mainly NVIDIA DRIVER ISSUES, I run AMD so I do not have these issues myself)- Lower ranks may take a large time for even skilled players to get out of due to solo 3v3 treating everyone the same- You cannot communicate to PS4 players except for a small amount of pre-determined chat commands- Voice codec is rather terrible, so advice is to use out of game communicationMiddle:= Servers are pretty much sorted now, the occasional lag spike will happen at peak times though= Currently no spectator system= NO PEER TO PEER, so even private matches require servers to be up= 4v4 is the limit, (some people see that as good, some as bad)= Any controller other than xbox may require some outside support or some other sort of executableThat is as fair as I can be to it, if I missed anything out, tell me.TL:DR, I think its a good game from my experience :DGET THE GAME HEREEDIT 1: Thanks to everyone for voting this to be the most helpful review for rocket league, to thank everyone, have this as a reward: REWARD[www.omfgdogs.com] have a great day guys :DFor those of you who asked for my PC specs, they can be found HERE[uk.pcpartpicker.com]EDIT 2: Last of all, Shameless plug for my Rocket League group you should TOTALLY join if you own the game because why not, lets play some games.

Product received for free
												I received Rocket League from a friend who swore by it that it was fun and addicting. Following that, I proceeded to play with him and some other friends; but we sucked...bad.700+ logged hours later....I am in the top 1% of all players in ranked and am addicted to this game!--------------------------------------Rocket league is a game that you can pickup for the first time and be terrible at, but have that feeling that if you fixed a few things, or made a few different moves, you could have done much much better. It is a fast paced game where:-The idea of the game is simple-The controls are exceptional! (For real, the cars all react to your controls exactly how you think they should.)-The skill cap is insanely high-Every single time the ball goes in the air, you feel like it is possible to make an insane goal off of itRocket league is the type of game that I can pickup for a few games and put back down, or I can just delve deep into an 8 hour session and keep trying to rank up and fix my mistakes I had last game.------------------------------------Psyonix (The developer) knows how to run this game. They are constantly pushing out new updates, patches, and content; most of which is free!They allow you to customize your vehicles, so no two are the same. Or you and some friends can team up, create the exact same cars, then be a three man wrecking crew of flying vans!Psyonix really thought of everything with Rocket league, and they keep adding more and more great content!------------------------------------All-in-all, Rocket league is a great game, cannot recommend it enough, and is totally worth even up to a price of $60! (Even though I got it for free!)So have fun in rocket league, work your way to the top, and...Calculated.Calculated.Calculated.			",74,4,5,4,4,0,4

												If you're even just slightly interested in arcade racing games and/or football, then you should check this out...well, actually, even if you're not ;)In Rocket League, you're playing football (or soccer) with cars, with the addition that you have a speed booster and you can jump, which can make for some great moves and aerial shots.You can choose from 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 or 4v4 Matches, so it's nowhere near as much players as in real football, but that's actually a good thing, even with 4v4 it can get pretty messy and chaotic...then again, that can be fun as well ^^It's rather easy to get into the game, as you have tutorial for the basics, like handling your booster, doing aerial shots, defense etc. But that doesn't mean there is no challenge. To do those insane aerial maneuvers, you'll need quite some training.The Main Motivation comes from being a competitive game, either via ranked games or normal matches against other players. There is also a single-player mode, but that's more for practicing and getting into the game than a selling point for the game.You can also unlock stuff for your car, like hats, booster color, tires and patterns to put onto your car.I've never been a big fan of either genre, yet Rocket League manages to pull me in and gets me excited about every match i play. Even if you're playing with random people, it's not that bad and you can have quite some fun, though having a good team which is working good together would be the most fun.So, hope to see some of you on the field :)			",315,208,6,26,27,4,18

												IF you've never played Rocket League, like many other good games you're probably going to be dog♥♥♥♥♥♥when you first start. You'll first join the tutorial and start touching the ball, yea it feels good we know. Then you decide you'll give online a go, REAllY see what this ♥♥♥♥♥ is about. You're first game online you get 2 clears and a center ball, pretty raunchy. You decide to tax yourself on another game and press rematch. You give a great pass to your team mate, wou lose 1-2. You continue to play online even though you have no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ you're doing but for some reason you can't stop playing it. Then you start to progress and get better and learn to manipulate the car and the ball in ways you've never seen, and fly(Did I mention you could ♥♥♥♥ing fly). You then start to forget about where you came from and whether or not you even liked the damn game to begin with. You slowly then being training every day before work or school, practicing aerials and dribbling in free play mode. The ball slowly becomes a part of you. You become the rank of ""Pro"" and you're feeling pretty damn hot right now♥♥♥♥♥♥ even scalding. You slowly climb the ranks and descend into the madness that is rocket league. Then the itch starts. You'll be at work or out running errands thinking about how much better time could be spent playing rocket league. When you see a subaru on the road, it's not a subaru to you anymore it's now a Takumi. When you go to bed you dream of Rocket League. Now we go back to the original question of whether or not you would like this game? You'll ♥♥♥♥ing love it, too much. The developers, Psyonix, are incredibly good at listening to what the community wants. Each update they continue to push out more and more content and the game is growing everyday. So many funny options to decorate and customize your cars, from toppers to antennas. You can unlock items in game and craft rarer, more exclusive items from those. You dont have to good at rocket league to like it, you just have to be better at having fun. I have made so many memories off this $20 purchase. Like how the hell are they only charging $20 for this game its incredible. I Have put more time and heart into this game on PC and Xbox then any of the main AAA titles that I used to play, and I probably won't stop. Buy this game. Play this game. Love this game.

												Rocket League is a vehicle based football game developed by Psyonix. In Rocket League you get behind the wheel of one of a number of different cars and face off against up to 4 opponents in an effort to hit a giant football in to the opposing team's goal. Enjoyable in solo play, local multiplayer and online matchmaking you can either play 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 and even unbalanced matches! (only available in offline exhibition mode).+Great graphics and visual effects+A wide range of customisation options unlocked as you complete matches+There's a season mode if you wish to play solo so you don't have to just play exhibition games repeatedly, the season mode is actually pretty good and features a number of different options which make it more interesting+Local multiplayer supports up to four players (providing you have enough controllers)+A number of different maps, each with several time and weather variations+Cross-platform multiplayer with PS4 players (though the party system currently doesn't work when doing cross-platform matches)+Rocket League features some quick messages which get assigned to your controller's hat switch allowing you to communicate quickly with your teammates+You can save the replays of your matches to watch back later+Obviously it has full controller support for 360 controllers as well as Xbox One controllers and the controls are fantastic+It's even entertaining for those of us who aren't keen on playing sports games+Your car's top speed is considerably higher on a pitch made of tarmac compared to a grass pitch, it's not a major feature but it's certainly a nice touch+As mentioned earlier you can play unbalanced matches when playing offline exhibition, they provide and extra layer of challenge and are great fun when playing local multiplayer+/-The game's bots aren't great but this game is best enjoyed by playing multiplayer anyway-Solo play gets pretty repetitiveVerdict:An Essential Purchase (9.5/10)Rocket League is an incredibly good multiplayer game with great visuals, lots of customisation options and a number of different maps. If you're looking for a new multiplayer game or just something a bit different, you've come to the right place.No drama, Just Reviews.El K.			",670,170,24,76,100,6,76

												Fast-paced game where cars play football carball. A great concept backed up by its great gameplay!Everything on this game is just spot on; The steering, the map sizes, the game lenghts, where the boosts are placed at...This game has also alot content to unlock. There are no real advantanges what car you are using, except some cars have a bit tinier or larger hit box. I honestly like this, because I can use the car for the looks and not for the advantage.No matter if you play mostly FPS games, MOBA, mmorpg etc. this game will be perfect for you. I can honestly recommend this game for EVERYONE. I am pretty sure that I will spend hundreds of hours on this game.Buy this game, you wont regret it.			",86,22,5,10,7,1,5

In the 80s and 90s, this is what everyone thought video games would be like in the future: rocket cars playing virtual sports; TRONxSpeed Racer, with the international appeal of soccer. You're jacked in to this new thing called the Internet, where you can play against people the world 'round. You're a weakly 13 year old midwesterner named Billy, but when you're jacked in, you're Tom Cruise in Top Gun, no, Days of Thunder. You're the best there ever was.Stay on target, stay on target... click, blarp. You're out of rocket fuel! You click again just in case, like a last desperate pull of an empty gun's trigger. The clock ticks downward as you swerve towards a boost pickup... you grab it... seconds left on the clock... the ball appears in front of you as an angel out of the blue... you jump, squeeze the last bit of juice out of your machine and soar heavenward... AND IT'S GOOD! BILLY FROM THE MIDWEST HAS DEFEATED THE RUSSIAN MENACE!!!!Every second you play the game is the last five minutes of every sports movie ever made.			",429,114,8,38,41,9,50

												Rocket League is a great game. The core mechanics are fun and very well executed. Currently the servers don't work and I haven't been able to play online. I would easily reccomend this game for the single player alone. The only real concern I have is that it may not offer enough content to keep the community alive for any significant length of time.  Edit* Servers are working now. For a more in-depth review watch my video review here:

												Rocket League is an excellent game and one of my favourites. It's very easy to understand but hard to master.Optimisation is great, and graphics are fantastic. The game also has a full controller support, but you can play with a mouse and keyboard as well, so it's up to you how you want to play. I more prefer the controller.After the first launch of the game, you will hear a fantastic music on the menu. After that, you can choose your car. Play a tutorial, and finally, you will be ready to play your first multiplayer game.In the game, there are a lot of cars, and you can also buy paid DLC. Cars from DLCs are technically the same. The only differences are hit boxes. According to developers, all of the cars have the same stats. Vehicles are customisable. For example, you can add an antenna, change your wheels, colour of the car, etc.Like I wrote above Rocket League is very easy to understand because, in the main mode, the game consists of control the giant ball and try to score. To put it simply, it's just football with cars. You can choose between 1vs1, 2vs2, 3vs3, and 4vs4. The main modes are playable on casual and competitive modes. But there are also game modes which are more advanced like for example ice hockey, basketball and my personal favourite 'RUMBLE'. In 'RUMBLE' rules are the same, but here, every ten seconds the game draws for you one special ability. For example grappling hook, a tornado and a freezer weapon.As I mentioned above, here are competitive matches. After ten games, you will get your rank. There's  15 ranks: PROSPECT (I, II, III, Elite) CHALLENGER (I, II, III, Elite), RISING STAR, ALL-STAR, SUPERSTAR, CHAMPION, SUPER CHAMPION, GRAND CHAMPION.The game rewards us in the form of points for all sorts of tricks, like aerials, bicycle hits, etc.The VerdictRocket League is a unique game with simple rules. If you haven't bought this game yet, do it. You won't regret. My final rating is 10/10.If you found any mistakes, something isn't right, or you just don't like this review. Instead of giving me a thumbs down, tell me what is wrong. Thank you.			",48,4,0,1,7,1,4

												Buy this gameBuy this gameBuy this gameChat disabled for 4 seconds﻿You'll find yourself playing hours upon hours with Rocket League. It's a must have game, and just about anybody can play it. I'd have to give Rocket League 9 - 1/2 out of 10. only because I don't like the match making system. I think it's a little broken to be honest.You'll have a good amount of vehicles to choose from the get go with coustom paint jobs, stickers, hats and other crazy things. (DLC's) are worth getting too.An amazing soundtrack. The music in this game gets a 10/10.It's an awesome game to just have fun with with friends or family and is well worth buying.Edit...As of today, I can honestly say ranked matches are foocked! I'm sick to death of going in to a match with awesome team mates one game and to then go into the next match with AFK's and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's a never ending cycle. Within the last fifty matches, I haven't moved up or down ranks at all.  The game is still awesome, just stay in unranked if you want to enjoy it.			",538,131,54,52,62,7,48

 Very addictive and entertaining game. Rocket League is a game that always introduces new aspects to you and never lets you get bored. It is definitely a 'just 5 more minutes' game but amazingly entertaining at the same time. The trading community is excellent and finally getting an item you always wanted can leave you feeling so accomplished. The car customization itself is an awesome feature that offers so many different customizations. As you progress through the different skill levels there are new techniques to learn and playstyles which are awesome to know. The competitive scene behind this game is getting larger and it is so fun to watch such high level players play!All in all, i'd completely recommend this game to anyone, whether you're a casual player or very competitive!

												edit: I wrote this prior to becoming an employee at PsyonixLet me start by saying that I have been playing the preview of this game since June 26th, I also was a part of the alpha in 2014 and part of multiple betas.Simply said, this game is the most fun that may ever exist. You find yourself constantly saying 'Just one more game' over and over and over again because you literally cannot just put it down. It's simple: a car arena like showdown on a soccer field with one giant ball and a bunch of boost to fill your rocket powered dreams, but don't be fooled because this game is much deeper than it will originally look. Psyonix takes a very simlpe core idea and allows us to do whatever we want with it because of its purely physics based gameplay. What does this give us though? Let me tell you. Satisfyingly tight controls, action packed multiplayer, awe inspiring aerial goals, sniper tactics, competitive and casual matchmaking, hours of laughing and enjoyment, TONS of explosions (Mr. Torgue aproved), an incredibly balanced game, all future maps will be free, PC to PS4 crossplay, over 150 items for purely cosmetic customizations, and over 10billion of said combinations. I can really only say so much about the game itself (partly because English was my worst course :P) but what I really cannot stress enough is that you won't be staying for just the game alone. You'll be seeing Psyonix as one of the only developers left that actually understand what we want as well as falling in love with the community. The community of Rocket League (and SARPBC for that matter) is probably the most open, friendly and supportive community I have come accross. Of course this is being said before release and I really hope that you new players please uphold our standard of ingame complements, willingness to help out anyone that wants to learn, and general good sportsmanship. If you find yourself running into a few bad apples, don't worry about it, as you climb up the ladder into the ranks with the rest of the long time players you'll notice the warmer atmosphere to say the least :)Now I suppose I should say that within the last week I've apparently played nearly 90hrs and that's just playing private matches with the same people constantly. Some would think that I'd be bored after that, but you'd be so so wrong. I can play all day, get into bed and watch some Rocket League videos, and then immediately want to play more (I may or may not be addictive :| but don't think you're immune).Anyways, I'm going to play some more Rocket League. I hope to see you on the field, and remember... Nice shpt! And never let the ball touch the ground (Rule #1)			",129,26,6,12,22,3,10

												Rocket League is one of my favorite games.  Why?The game's system is the best that i can imagine. Your advantage over other players isn't measured by how many hours you have, how many dlcs you got, or your level. It's measured by how much you've learned and perfected.You start as a derp car that can't hit a ball 20ft above the ground. Then you keep playing against people of the same skill, until you see someone who can do some cool/pro/funky/op stuff, then you see his goals and you think: ""Wow, look at that shot, i must learn how to do it!""              Then in a matter of time, you learn how to do it and even do better. One step closer to become a Rocketeer.                                                                         some more training and you can hit the ball wherever it is.                                                    even more and you can aim the ball wherever you want.The controls are great, comfortable and very easy to learn. If you use a controller, you will not have an advantage against who uses a keyboard and vice-versa.The graphics are nice, you can play it with a microwave using low graphics, or a medium computer on max graphics with a solid 60 fps. They could be better though (?)The levels normally represent your skill very well if you aren't a lot above-average or below-average, with a Rookie playing like a rookie and a legend playing like a legend. (The level ""Pro"" is just wrong, you probably aren't pro yet if you are there)The matchmaker does its job well. Rather than your level, it takes your ""skill"" in consideration, so you will often play with people only slightly better or worse than you. This isn't bad, it is actually very good for you to learn and get better.Can i say anything more?NO item in the game gives you advantage over other player, all cars have the same speed and the only thing that changes is the hitbox, not a big deal when you learn the controls. The DLCs don't make you better or anything, too.			",166,20,5,12,17,0,12

												OK first of all its a shame that most negative reviews are based on first 2 days after release where the team of devs had some problems with the servers. They worked day an night and now everything is working fine at least for me.So, i played this game on Beta on PS4 and i was pretty hyped about the launch. It didn't disapoint. I have it for free on PS4 and bought it on steam to play with friends.The game is a ton of fun. The gameplay is easy to learn, hard to master.Graphics are pretty nice and cars come with a ton of costumization options (FOR FREE).We can face AI opponents with diferente skill levels (that can make a huge diference) or we can play vs players usually with simillar skill (sometimes u can face players really better than u but their in game rate is the same or lower than yours).There are several game modes but the only major difference is the amount of players and ranked match or not.Its great to play with friends. Hard to quit playing even if you're really tired.I seriously recomend using a controller. I use my DS4 with Bluetooth (using inputmapper) and it works perfectly. For ppl using other controllers i recomend x360ce (helped 2 friend who were using a ds2 and a sega saturn controller).A word also for the devs that seem to work night and day to fix problems. Keep up the  good work.Great game. One of the better for sure to release this year.			",55,7,0,8,3,2,6

Rocket League ReviewGame DetailsGame: Rocket LeagueGenre: SportsDeveloped by: PsyonixPublished by: PsyonixRelease Date: 7 July, 2015Metacritic Score: 86 (Link[www.metacritic.com])Game Review""Lets play some Carball!""Rocket League is a game which combines soccer and reckless driving. It is a sequel to the game SARPBC, Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars and it is produced by Psyonix. It includes cross-platform play between PS4 and PC, having an huge playerbase currently.GameplayYou will have lots of fun with this game guaranteed! The controls are ultra-simple to use, you will get used to them in a blink of an eye. I play the game with a controller, which for me it is the best way to play it, but it is enjoyable to play with the keyboard + mouse too. The game itself is ultra fun! The ball physics with the rebounds and all feel impressively well, as the cars handling. It is incredibly easy to play, yet extremely difficult to master. You also have to use strategy in this game in order to win the matches, much like regular soccer. If you are just a ball chaser you will have difficult times winning, you have to think about your positioning and timing very well. You can also do incredible trick shots and jump shots due to your boost, which are incredible hard to master, but after some time you will start to get the hang of it. The worst part are some camera angles and the bots AI, but unless you plan on only playing offline games, the AI wont be much of a problem. It feels so good to make some incredible plays, even when you fail you will have tons of laughs. It is a very simple game with simple ideas, yet they work perfectly and make this game a blast to play for both casual and professional players.LongevityThe longevity of a game which relies on an multiplayer-focused game can be debatable, but in this one I am sure you will spend enough hours to compensate the money you spend in the game. At the moment I have spent 35 hours and intend to spend many more. You have tons of cars, paint jobs, hats and other customization stuff to unlock during the game that will keep you entertained for the first hours (I unlocked everything in around 20 hours). You also have 4 different game-modes (1vs1, 2vs2, 3vs3, 4vs4) which give some good diversity since each one of the modes has its own strategies to follow in order to win them. You also have an offline season mode available to play, but it is kind of boring in my opinion given the multiplayer options you have. Practice mode is also available, a great place to tune your skills up. The ranks and leaderboards system will also entertain you, it is great to climb up against your friends in the diverse list of leaderboards available.Graphics and PresentationOnly have good things to say here too. By the moment you enter the game you will know you are in for something special. Slick menus with an ultra easy interface plus amazing songs will make you excited right at the first time you open the game. You got plenty of voice commands to use in-game which is definitely a plus presentation wise. Now the graphics. Another win in this spectacular game. Great graphics for a game this simple. All works really well, the colors, grass, car details, everything looks great. The level of detail in the cars and their customization objects is great too. These are some impressive visuals, even though the main focus of the game is definitely not the graphics.Music and SoundsThe soundtrack in this game is amazing. I was totally not expecting it, there are really some great songs in it, got some of them stuck in my head. There are only around eleven songs in it, but most are awesome and don't get old. The various sounds in the game are also great, from the sounds of the different boost types, ball hits, drifts, crashes, everything works really well.MultiplayerThis is the big deal in this game. And oh boy, how fun it is to play it with or against friends. You will have tons of fun making the best goals ever as well as the biggest fails in history. It really gives you tons of laughs. You have also the option to play ranked instead of casual games, which make for some more intense, fun matches! The playerbase is huge, around 100000 players are online in most of the time, so you will find games in a matter of seconds. The community is in it´s majority very friendly, but like in all multiplayer games, you will find some toxic people playing the game too. You also have different server regions to choose from so you can play without worrying about lag. Unfortunately I did have some crazy lags in some european servers. It is rare to find a laggy server but it happens and can get very frustrating, specially when you are playing ranked. Yet, I am sure the devs will fix most of the server issues soon, so no worries about that.SummaryPros:Newcomer-friendly gameplay, yet difficult to masterGreat controlsAmazing soundtrackGreat graphics and presentationAmazing multiplayer with lots of fast-paced, intense matchesCons:The Bots AI is pretty weakSome connection issues in multiplayerMy personal score: 9.0/10If you enjoy high octane reckless driving and the world's most popular sport, Rocket League is for you. It is one of the most fun multiplayer games released in the last years. The base price is great value for the game you get, which will get you hours and hours of great fun! Embrace the latest gaming trend in Steam and PS4 and have a blast playing this soccer-meets-cars gem!			",814,226,41,97,55,8,123

IntroductionI've often found myself with little pockets of time in which I've wondered, ""What should I do now?"". You know, those moments in time where you have too little time to play a really lengthy, story-driven game (or League of Legends), but way more time than you can feasibly sit and idle. It's as if our prayers were collectively answered with this fantastic game from Psyonix; Rocket League.Take out your controllers boys & girls, we're playing football....with cars.GameplayI've been playing games like Fifa and PES from the glory '98 days, but eventually my interests changed. After all, it was simply a game of football. There is only so much you can do with human players. Apparently Psyonix thought outside of the box. What they delivered was simply a stroke of genius. Gone were the human players we were accustomed to. Instead, rocket-powered cars jetted their way across the map in record speeds. This wasn't enough though. They altered the map, super-sized the ball, and set each player in control of only one car at a time.This formula gave birth to the high-intensity game of Rocket League. Your goal is to hit the massive ball into the opponent's goal. Sounds simple enough right? Wrong. With rocket jumps, speed boosts, rocket-propelled flight and the unique map shapes, you'll find yourself in an endless chase at breakneck speed for possession of the ball. While this game is absolutely beginner friendly, it has an insanely high skill-ceiling. In other words, no matter how good you think you are, there is someone who is leagues above you.Each team can have up to 5 players, though the 3v3 format is the standard mode, and has a nice balance between chaos and fun. The potential teamwork between players is definiely one of my favourite aspects, and promotes friendly behavior for those epic goals. Don't be surprised if you get called out for accidentally hitting the ball away from the opponent's goal, or worse, hitting it into your own.Quick-chat commands are rather peaceful, but after seeing 3 censored swear words, you'll probably get the idea. The sarcastic tones of ""What a Save!"" upon scoring a goal always gives me a chuckle, and the genuine compliments from opponents is a welcome breath of fresh air, and pride.Car selection & customization should probably be a mini-game on its own. With a wide variety of colours, hats, boost trails and decals to choose from, you'll likely have more than a few saved presets that you'll cycle through. With an ever-growing roster of cars and cosmetics, there's plenty to appeal to everyone.Speaking of appeal, there's much more than your classic game of football in Rocket League. Games such as basketball and hockey have found their way into the ever-growing list of game modes, and I often find myself cycling through them all quite frequently. Hell, even my 5 year old cousin loves it. Think you've got the skills to make it higher? You'll be happy to test your skills in the competitive mode. To be honest, I haven't really played much of this, since I prefer the other modes so much more.VisualsDon't let its colourful nature confuse you, rocket league is one beautiful & optimized game. I was pleasantly surprised to discover how easy it was to run on even some old potatoes, and its ability to be quite visually appealing on higher settings. The explosions and particle effects are both colourful and beautiful. The cars are nicely detailed, and the animations are right on point. AudioIf you for some reason haven't listened to Rocket League's soundtrack, get it...now. I find myself upset that it's not on by default while playing, but there are plenty of workarounds to really listen and enjoy the music all year round. The tracks are entertaining and insanely high quality. Soundtrack aside, the regular SFX are no less impressive. Vehicle sounds, explosions, and the 'fake crowd' cheering are just a few of the many things this game has to offer for your audiophile needs.Summary & ConclusionWhether you've got only 5 minutes to spare, or an entire afternoon, Rocket League offers hours of addictive fun that never seems to grow old. This unique spin on a timeless sport is sure to appeal to a very wide audience, and you can be sure that your experience is likely gonna be a great one.For $20, this game is worth full price, but you can always get it on sale pretty often.I rarely grant this one but,10/10 - Just simply fun, addicting and worth every penny.Props to the devs for showing that an independent team could release such a big hit without submitting to the horrible DLC practices of modern gaming.======================================This endorsement approved by The Reviewers' Union,providing better standards for reviews and reviewers.====================================== ",391,84,26,36,18,4,41

												Amazing game.This game is so dynamic and energetic, not a second is spent bored. Non stop action with your team, always edging to get the game deciding nudge, whether it be defense or attack. You spend hours, upon hours, getting addicted and mastering your skills. This game will make it to the massive multiplayer leagues. Rocket League will improve once they get proper class ranks, gained through playing ranked matches. Rocket League also features in depth customisation, allowing the user to ultimately customise their vehicle. This allows uniqueness, and a great ton of laughter.Graphics of this game are amazing. If your computer isn't the best then you'll have to turn down the graphics a little, but your PC doesn't need to be expensive to play the game on great graphics. Decent laptops can even play this game decently.This game is honestly a 9/10. Rocket League has the graphics, the dynamic energetic gameplay, the competitive experience in multiplayer and more.

												Rocket League is a Football(Soccer) inspired sports game made by Psyonix. In this game you use a car to hit around a large ball into a goal, pretty much Football(Soccer) with cars. It might be the best game I've played this year so far.There are a few different game modes, including online, Exhibition where you play against bots or your friends in local play, and a season mode where you play as a member on a team and you try and complete a season and win the championship. The game modes are fun, but not very different from each other. I do wish the Season mode was more like a Franchise mode in something like Madden, being able to control all the little things of your team, and having more stat tracking would make it a lot better, but its still worth a play or two.The gameplay in this game is perfect. Once you figure out the flow to your car, how to use boosting properly, and how to track the ball, you'll realize just how addicing the game can be. Against bots or online, the game shines in its fun and addicting gameplay that adds a unique twist on the game of Football(Soccer). Learning the game comes quick, but mastering the techniques could easily take 30-50 hours of gameplay. You have a large selection of cars and different things you can design them with. The speed and hitboxes are pretty much the same, so there isn't an optimal car to use, which is a great thing. All the different customization is basically cosmetic that does some minor stat tracking. I'm really happy they went this route, because you don't feel obligated to build your car based on some kind of metagame, you can customize it however you like it. Besides the season mode being kind of lacking, the only other complaint I had(notice, had), was the online. The first day I had it I couldn't play online at all, it just didn't work, and apparently until Saturday the online was pretty much broken. Thankfully, its been pretty much fixed, but I thought it would be an important point to mention. It is good that the developers showed commitment and actually fixed the problem, though.Rocket League is an amazing game with addictive gameplay. I don't really get the people that say they don't like sports games, a lot of the gameplay and stat tracking in them is great, and this game is no exception. If your looking for a game to play with friends, or even by yourself that is very competitive based, or even if your just bored and looking for a game to risk $20 on, Give Rocket League a shot, its one of the best games to come out this year. Pros:-Strong gameplay-Easy to learn, hard to master -Plenty of car customization-No car building meta, you can customize without worry-Encoranges teamwork-Reasonable asking price($20)Cons:-Lacking season mode could use more stat tracking and player control Buy At Full Price  ",405,95,7,66,41,4,42

												This game doesn’t really need another “thumbs up” but I feel obligated to write a review since I spent 100+ hours playing it (by the way, that’s a lie! I only played a couple of matches!) It doesn’t matter if you are a racing/football fan or not. You’ll love it. This game appeals to both casual and competitive players. You will suck most of the time and sometimes score amazing goals and it would feel incredible! This is one of those games that is easy to learn and very hard to master. I am still horrible at it after 100 hours. The good thing is that it is still entertaining even if you are losing more often than winning. So is it a great game? Hell, yes! Do I recommend it? No, unless you want to get sucked in and get addicted to this devil’s child of a game. I got it for free with Steam hardware. At this point I am ready to pay $20 just to get rid of it. I am uninstalling it tonight. I am just going to play one match real quick. Ok, maybe two... Addiction Level: Crack cocaine / 10.UPDATE: I now have 300+ hours in this game. Please send help.UPDATE 2: 500 hours... whatever, keep my soul, Rocket League!			",1578,792,33,163,160,17,190

												As a competitive gamer, it's not often I'm able to find a game that continues to be enjoyable while I'm getting getting completely dominated; but Rocket League delivers that perfectly. I've played for almost 400-hours and I have yet to figure out why, exactly, this game is so fun to so many different people from so many walks of life. But whatever the reason, Psyonix has delivered a near-flawless hybrid cross between a Single-Character-Controlled Sports game (Soccer, Hockey, Basketball), a Racing game, a Flying game, and a competitive multiplayer experience.Pros:- Replayability is consistent.- Servers cover /many/ regions. (Most of the world.)- No single Battlecar has a distinct advantage in all fields over every other Battlecar. (There are pros and cons to every Battlecar.)- Battlecar customizability feels endless.- Fun for casual gamers.- Fun for competitive gamers.- Quick 5-minute matches so you aren't forced to risk losing after 45-minutes.- Split-screen playable Local OR Online.- Psyonix listens to players and integrates desired features.- This Pros list could go on and on.Cons:- Not the easiest game to just pick up and play.-- New players may become discouraged by having difficulty hitting the ball at all. (Don't give up! You'll get it down relatively quickly!)- Online players can be incredibly rude (as with any online multiplayer game).- It takes a LOT of time to become a skilled player.- In-game voice chat quality is unbearable. (Most players use third-party VoIP programs to avoid this issue.)It has been years since I've found a game that has me as addicted and dedicated as I am to Psyonix's Rocket League. This is a game I'll be playing for a long, long time.9.5/10EDIT: Paid DLC is not completely cosmetic, as DLC Battlecars have different hitboxes and turn radiuses than base cars. This, however, does not make any paid DLC Battlecar specifically better than base Battlecars. Every Battlecar has its pros and cons between hitboxes and turn radiuses.			",303,69,20,18,25,8,30

												To give you an idea of how good this game is - I currently have 511 games in my Steam library, and this is the only one I've gone out of my way to review. SARPBC (the PS3 predecessor to Rocket League) has been a favorite of my friends and I for... years. Literally years. We've put thousands of hours into it. It's one of those incredibly rare games that all of us are always keen to play because it's always fun. Rocket League, I'm happy to say, is SARPBC with improved graphics and gameplay, better accessibility for new players, plus a ton of added options that give the game an extra layer of character. It's going to comfortably replace SARPBC in my top five games, all-time, across all genres. It's also replacing SARPBC as my absolute favorite multiplayer game - online or local. Positive+ Fun, deep, brilliantly fast-paced gameplay+ Games are long enough to mean something, but short enough that a loss is never too frustrating.+ Games are almost never over until the final buzzer. Results can turn on a dime - and when they do, it's always because a player or team has stepped up, rather than any fault of or flaw with the game itself. + The learning curve is fairly smooth, but the skill ceiling is also incredibly high. Despite the aforementioned years playing SARPBC, I still see players in Rocket League pulling off moves that I can only dream of.+ There's massive flexibility in how you play, more than any other game I know of. Offline with bots. Offline split-screen. Online. Online split-screen. Online split-screen with bots. 1 v 1 if you don't feel like playing on a team, or 2 v 2 / 3 v 3 / 4 v 4 if you do. And the game is just as suited to mano-a-mano matches as it is to team play, which is (again) a very, very rare quality.Negative- The one slightly disappointing thing I'll mention is (at launch) the lack of variety in maps. SARPBC had a bunch of quite inventive, distinctive maps that forced different play styles and tactics. Rocket League's maps are aesthetically different, but structurally uniform. Luckily, word is that some 'crazier' maps will likely be arriving in the forthcoming free DLC.  I'm still thoroughly enjoying what's already there, but some extra variety in that regard will definitely be welcome.ConclusionIf the idea of fast-paced soccer (sans rules) with cars even vaguely appeals to you, get this game immediately. It's one I fully expect to still be playing - and thoroughly enjoying - years from now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Rocket League is one of the most unique, innovative games around.

												This game is as addicting as FIFA soccer is. I do however recommend it with prudence. This game is action packed but can be seen simplistic by a few.I've played the game back in alpha and didn't much care for it. I like it now more than previously, which is an extremely good thing.Rocket league is a soccer game played with RC cars. Obviously, the goal is to get the ball into the opponents net. Cars are given a few abilities to mix up the game. They can easily scale and drive on walls, and even up side down on the roof for a period of time (or longer with enough turbo). Boost or turbo is another feature in game. To acquire turbo, players must drive over small hot spots spread throughout the terrain. Some hot spots give minor turbo boosts while others will fill up the gauge all the way. Boosts when timed correctly, can produce a power hit on the ball. Some boosts when held down for a certain amount of time engage in some sort of ultra speed. When going this fast and if a player is in your way, you have the ability to literally run through and destroy the opponent. I am a huge fan of games which feature double jump, and rocket league has it! The first jump is a bit of a slow jump, while the second provides for another boost upwards, forwards, to the side or in reverse. While in the air, the player has quite a bit of flexibility to move about. This trick comes in hand when attempting to defend or attempting to knock the ball in an awkward angle. It can look pretty cool when done right. There are no power-ups within the games so this fact alone may turn a few people away from the game... this is only of course if you play competitive. Non-competitive games feature power-ups. None the less, the devs took a simplistic approach to keep the game engaging. The matchmaking that is available is organized very neatly and local co-op is an extremely appreciated feature. Matchmaking is a bit funny to me in the sense where if only four players are available, it will add two AI's instead of allowing for a 2v2 vote. Again, it's not a big deal as empty slots are filled up with AI's (sometimes extremely annoying AI's that score on themselves). This however only applies in non-competitive mode which for the most part is ok. A neat feature is there is an arrow that indicates where the ball is off screen. Additionally, there is a circle marker on the ball to show where and how far up in the air is the ball. Players can press Y to change the camera view off the car and toward the ball. The player can also choose to toggle the lock button for the camera.Graphics are well done and nothing seems cut short. You can optimize for performance or quality (whoot whoot)! There are different stages in the game but they are limited (or I should say were limited). A few more ""out of this world"" stages have been added for free which is greatly appreciated. The customizations regarding the cars are absolutely well done. From custom paint jobs, custom wheels, to even custom hats (that for some weird reason keep your goal count). My only complaint if I can have one is the DLC purchases for new car skins... but hey, who am I to judge. The menu's and the UI was also well done and everything is kept simple and neat. The music and sounds in game have improved since it's start. I love how different boosts all have a different sound and some even play music. This is really paying attention to detail. The sound tracks in general are pretty catchy. That could be part in fact I've also heard them numerous times.The game is quite exciting and cars seemingly fly everywhere. It's enjoyable when everyone crashes into the ball, but it is even more delightful when people start calculating hits and play positions.For future Rocket League DLC's or games, it would be nice to see some mini-games! The main part of the game is excellent, but imagine adding some modifications to it. Perhaps adding power-ups could give an alternative to matchmaking.Overall good game, and I would recommend it to most people. There are a few friends that are reluctant to get into it, but for the most part it has received positive reception.***Dec 2016 update : there are new game modes that involve other sports such as hockey or basket ball. I think this is a neat step as it creates many new opportunities. They are not available in competitive mode, but are still very fun to play. You're essentially a flying projectile whenever you wish. When you get the hang of flying, this game's opportunities start flying wide open. Very simplistic game but you can definitely see the skill range of some players is phenomenal. Unlike FIFA where you would get discouraged, I'm sure you'll start challenging yourself when you see some of these crayz stunts.RATING : 8.1/10 Gameplay A Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability A Overall  A-ScreenShots :  Riding upside down on the roof. There is an arrow to the left of my car to indicate where the ball is Usual start to a rocket league game  You can use your boost to fly through the air. You can also modify the color and type of boost that comes from the car Coming in for a one timer at full speed  Ain't easy being the best  ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

Rocket League > League of LegendsRocket League is the best League-----------------A stranger once said to me, in response to the above statement:""oh yeah, thats why in twitch you can see more than 200k viewers on lol and 50k on rocket""To him, or any other who has similar remarks, I proclaim the following words:""Greatness is not measured in viewer counts or player amounts.Greatness, my friends, is measured in leagues""Truth be told, there is no game that can compare to the glorious, magnificent experience that is Rocket League. This masterpiece is truly in a league of its own.Furthermore, before any of you cast forth accusations upon me, I can assure you, I am not in league with those who developed this supreme, rocket-powered work of exquisitely coordinated, flashing pixels.-----------------Ok you know what? forget the formalities and proper grammar. Imma shoot straight with you. If you thought you could just buy the game and top the leaderboards in a day, you. thought. wrong.The journey's gonna be harder than that trek from a toilet-paperless dump to that stack of extra rolls in your basement in the middle of the night with the lights out.Most of the ppl you meet will be way out of your league, and its gonna take guts, practice, and a controller if you want to make it anywhere. So Stand Tall. Stand Proud.So Sit Down. On Your Butt.Idle In That Menu.Listen To That Soundtrack.Join That Game.And Get Rekt Make That Ball Go Boom.			",177,16,6,5,9,3,16

												I love this game!  Soccer/Football in RC cars with jets strapped to their back and an exploding ball.  The controls are tight, the action intense and it's a pulse pounding thrill ride even when you lose.Don't get me wrong, just like with real soccer/football it's easy to play but difficult to play well.  But the training gives you the tools, you just need to practice. Highly recommended for anyone who likes action packed games with high speed thrills and crazy crashes.  Remember when you were a kid and you were practicing catching high fly balls?  How you had to practice getting under it and timing it just right?  Get ready for that with jet cars.

												I don't like soccer. I don't like cars. I love Rocket League!Even with no interest whatsoever in the theme, I find Rocket League excellent as a game. Easy to learn, hard to master. It doesn’t start dull, it is fun right from the start as a beginner, and it only gets better as you improve.It involves a very wide range of skills which gives the gameplay a lot of variety by constantly engaging your different abilities. I don’t mean variety as in different environments or doing different things, rather the variety applies to the ways in which the game demands your participation both physically (mechanical skills, accuracy, timing, consistency, …) and mentally (spatial awareness, intuition for the game’s physics like momentum or bounces, team coordination, …), pretty much like a real sport. This makes it one of the most fulfilling video games to play.Rocket League is the video game that feels the closest to real life sports. It involves the same kind of skills and provides the same kind of fun. Absolutely recommended to everyone!			",140,23,4,3,10,0,26

If you want to end up going bald because you're all stressed out, then this is your game. If you want to rip your skin off since you're always saying ""one last match"" but you keep playing against the same ♥♥♥♥ers, then this is your game. Long story short, you're going to absolutely love this game even if you want to commit suicide at the end of every match.			",192,91,9,15,19,3,13

Rocket League is a well-made mix between racing and soccer genre. If you are subscribed to any of gaming Youtube channels or websites, you are probably already familiar with the game and you know that there is quite a lot of hype about it. And that hype is not unjustified.If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end. What is happening in the game:You are in control of a car and your mission is to score enough goals to win the match with other players. You can play multiplayer (with actual people) or singleplayer (with bots). Also, there is a freeplay mode for you to sharpen your skills.Pros: The way this game looks is astonishing. Grass, cars, turbo effects, the ball, the arena ... they really look good. I mean, look at the Store page screenshots! Multiple game modes for both online and offline playing (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4). Ranked cannot be 4v4, however. If you play on ""Unfair"" difficulty against bots, you can also play 1v2, 1v3 and 1v4. There is a tutorial in this game and unlike some other games, you can actually learn stuff from this one. For basic playing, there is a short tutorial just explaining how to move and jump, but if you have time and will to take your playing technique to the next level, this is taken care of by more advanced tutorials. This is probably one of rare games where you actually want to play tutorial multiple times. Car handling is near-perfect, it really goes where you want it to go. Also, you can drive one the walls, fly and even drive upside down on the arena ceiling for a short time. A very special thing in this game is so-called ""Ball View"", where camera is always pointing towards the camera. You can turn it on and off at appropriate times to maximize your efficiency while trying to hit the ball into opponents' net. Car customization content is absurd. You get hundreds of wheels, antennas, hats, car types ... you are guaranteed to find a combination that suits you. Next thing about car customization is how you unlock parts. This is the best way I've seen it handled: you get something for every single match you play. Yes, you've heard right. No matter what you play, with bots with real people, 1v1, you always get something. After playing every match, you also get a chance to save a replay of the game you have just played. These saved games can be then watched from perspectives of all players, there is also a free camera mode. Matchmaking seems to be working well, I've never been in a match that would be completely unfair or unbalanced. The soundtrack is amazing, it consists of 11 songs that are also available on Amazon[www.amazon.com] and iTunes[itunes.apple.com]. You get XP even for playing with bots, but you get only 50% of you would get with playing online. Still, it's a great way to encourage people to play more. You also get some XP for losing. This thing runs great even on old computers and you don't even have to have all the setting set to low! The community is really active, there are almost five thousand threads created on Steam Discussions, there are tons of Youtube videos and streamers playing it.Cons: Only occasional lags when playing online. Also, sometimes servers are dead for a minute, but that only happened twice to me. Not a problem at all. There is PS4 support, but no Linux and MacOS? Come on!The final verdict:With practically no bad sides and tons of good stuff in this game, I certainly recommend it to everyone, not just fans of soccer or racing. I'm not a big fan of either of them, but I enjoy this game a great deal. You can customize your car in more than 10 billion combinations, the game really encourages you to play and the feeling when you play is amazing. This is certainly one of the best games released this year. There are so many people playing all the time, there are streams, Youtube videos, tons of discussions, simply amazing. You can't be sure how long is this going to last for, so try grabbing it as soon as it gets any discount or even now, as it is certainly worth the full 20$ price tag.Greetings,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

												ABOUT THE GAME :Rocket League is a Soccer inspired sports game made by Psyonix. In this game you use a car to hit around a large ball into a goal, pretty much Soccer with cars.

												This is my experience after playing the game for the first time with a friend:- got game, made party, got into a casual 2v2 match- 2 a.m., window wide open - forgot- start match- 30 minutes of rage/joy/fun/screaming- someone starts bashing on my front door- figure it's downstairs neighbour- go silent, ignore- still bashing- still silent/ignore- almost breaks down my door- have to open, see who it is- see cops, jail imminent- panic- open door, act nice- cop says he heard me down on the street in his car with his windows closed- start ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting him, I say the neighbour usually warns me first before calling the cops- cop says it wasn't the downstairs neighbour who called, but the one in the BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET- almost start laughing- cop asks WTF was I doing- start ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting him again- he asks why I have the window open- say I totally forgot- he asks: ""What game are you playing?""- he knows.- I ask: ""Is that a serious question?""- he says: ""Don't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t me, I've been a gamer for 15 years - what game?""- I say: ""Rocket League.""- he gives me a slight smile/nod of approval/understanding- HE KNOWS.- gives me back my ID: ""Keep the noise down, goodnight.""911/10 would be arrested again.

												What I thought was the worst concept EVER (really? Football and Cars together? Come on.. anyone?) ended up being one of the most addictive games I’ve come to cross around.PROS-Everyone is on the same page. There is no difference in XP, Cars, Skins or anything. SKILLS are everything-Very fluid-No bugs (at least I haven’t found one)-Multi-Platform-Coop and Local CoopCONS-NO OFFLINE LAN. That kind of sucks… really. This would be a reason to NOT RECOMMEND a good game, but this game is pretty great, so I still give it a recommend (Oh yeah, I wan’t to hear those brats from US and EU talk about how everyone got internet now and we don’t need LAN Anymore, and this is a stupid complain.. please go ahead) -Servers give a connection problem all the time. I asked a lot of people, and I am getting the same answer from at least 40% of the people. Maybe is just here in South America, and playing with servers outside the ping goes over 200. The good thing is that the game does not become totally unplayable, especially for new, not all that skilled players (like myself :D)-No the best Match Making system ever, but this is not a Con per say… just not so great yet I thinkBut really. Awesome game. Worth the full price. Tell your friends and Rocket!  ",651,181,39,43,65,10,87

												Rocket League...The game that took the gaming scene by surprise. Personally, I don't enjoy car games, racing games, or sports games. Especially not soccer. Then why does this game interest me so much?I have no idea. Nevertheless, I haven't been able to play hardly any other games for my newfound love for thrust sticks attached to what look like toy cars. You'll start out jump-flipping into the ball, and being amazed at how you hit it just right to make your first goal. Then you'll experiment with boosting after you jumped. ""I hit it!"" you say. Finally, you were able to touch the ball while it soars 50 feet above the ground. As you cascade to the field, you realize that the death-defying acrobatic maneuver was just enough to tip the ball into your goal ",185,38,3,14,18,3,28

												I couldn't recommend this game any more if I tried. Buy this game right now. You will never regret it.This is one of the most entertaining, fun, and addictive games I've ever played. Just like its predecessor, this game provides hours upon hours of entertainment. The physics are superb, the gameplay is easy to pick up and thrilling to master, and it looks beautiful. It's a game that definitely gets better as you improve, which makes it more and more fun as you play it. There's something extremely addicitve about playing football/soccer with cars, and with the addition of boost, acrobatics, and flying, it just never stops being fun. It's one of those games where you always say ""one more game"" over and over again. There's plenty of different gamemodes to play, including season mode, drill training, online ranked, unranked, private, split-screen, split-screen online, and a bunch more. Pros: The game looks beautiful The physics are spot on, so the game relies entirely on your own skill, with no automatic passing and shooting. You're on your own, which makes making saves and scoring goals so much more satisfying. It's so addictive...like really addictive...like ""oh my god is it 5am already?"" addictive. It's incredibly well optimised, as evident by the generous system requirements. You don't need a fantastic PC to play this game on high settings, but it still looks and plays beautifully at 60fps with not-as-good PCs There is a bunch of customisation features, including body types, skins, hats, boost trails, tires, and whatnot. Rank-based matchmaking, so you actually play people of similar ability, rather than being bored getting thrashed or thrashing other players There's cross-play with PS4 users It's a fantastic party game to play with your friends on split-screen, or online The gameplay is flawless, making it really easy for new players to pick up, but allowing for an insanely high skill ceiling where the top players can really pull of some amazing skillsCons: It will ruin other aspects of your life, such as your social life and work life with its addictiveness.Score: 11/10 ",160,21,6,13,8,0,7

												Rocket League is a rare example where the execution of a simple, absurd idea is so strong and so engaging that it doesn’t need a ton of extra features around it. The rush of ripping across the pitch at full turbo to deny a shot on goal with a clutch bicycle-kick is enough to bring me back time and time again for just “one more match,” even without meaningful progression systems. Rocket League is a great, goofy, easy to learn and difficult to master action-sports game which demands that you grab a few friends and play a few rounds			",136,6,7,15,21,1,19

You also have terrible camera settings, camera shake, and whatever else enabled.3 Someone tells you about kronovi or jhzer. 4 Your whole perspective on this ""simple"" car game changes, ""what the hell is an aerial? how did he do that?""5 you learn new tricks.6 you strive to be the best.7 you continue playing for many, many, hours and get angry when you lose8 you exit the game one day after a few months of playing and notice you have 800 hours. repeat from 5 and multiply the hours by 2Wow!Wow!Wow!Calculated.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(natively from xbox, and proud to say it's my most played game on console.)but, PC with that sweet 60+fps is better.

												Everything is perfect about it, I wouldn't change a thing about gameplay, it's that good. Amazingly fun game to play but even more fun, to me, is watching pros like Dirkend, Law, Tree, Kronovi, Gibbs, and sorry if I missed anyone that streamed beta/preview and actually has shown what are the game's possibilities. With that being said, I think and really hope that this game will become one of next E-sports big things, it certainly would be lots of fun for the audience. I'll give it 10/10 for the game, rate a lot lower for community because people that are leaving games a lot, but hopefully that will get changed.Definitely recommending it			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You never know how much fun a game can be until you actually try it.  Yeah, you hear all the glowing reviews, but sometimes you need to experience it for yourself.  So I bought the game, on sale for $11.20 (USD), and was able to quickly find a friend to play with.  The first thing I did was try the tutorial, which impressed me on how tight and responsive the conrols are.  That was a really good sign for a sport where control is necessary.  Next we jumped into an match with easy bots and I scored a goal in the first 4 seconds.  OK, I was not expecting that to feel so satisfying.  That was the exact point that the hook was set.  It is not easy to score goals.  You wait back at midfield for the right time to speed burst towards a centered pass only to see it go wide or deflect off another player.  You circle back and try to attack again and again.  Time goes by, and then you find yourself colliding with a teammate and happen to bump into the ball that trickles just fast enough to cross the goal line before the opponent can fly over to stop it.  The feeling of triumph floods over you and you cannot stop your grin from growing over your face. I am not even 2 hours in at this point and I already see the promise this game holds.  The potential for great fun with friends is there, and that's the key.  I find myself looking forward to my next match.  I can't wait to get out there and drive around like a crazed lunatic and smash some buddies into the wall.			",338,55,6,44,22,2,36

Cars playing soccer/footballBut wait! There is more:Even though on the first look this game's concept appears simple and goofy, the depth of gameplay found here is insanely high. Rocket League is one of those games which allow you to do amazing plays and moves if you dedicated time and effort into it, but at the same time provide a lot of fun while played casually with friends.What to expectThis game is the sequel to the PS3 game Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars from 2008. Therefore the game idea isn't new and the gameplay doesn't differ a lot. But since the same developer Psyonix stay behind Rocket League, their experience allowed them to address problems and improve the game (as well as shorten the name :P).Rocket League provides fast 5 minute rounds inside a box-shaped arena. The edges of the arena are curved to allow players to drive up walls and even on the ceiling. The team size can range from one to four players on each team.The gameplay is fast and because of the playingfield's small size goals can be scored from the other side of it, since there are no obstacles in the way other than a potentional defending player. Blocking the ball and doing a counterattack right afterwards happens within seconds and can turn an entire game.The carsThere are multiple car models to choose from, but their handling or top speed does not differ. Only the hitbox of the cars are slighly different - which creates some tiny variation in the ball interaction. However the main purpose of having multiple cars is to customize it without interfering or imbalancing the gameplay. This works very well and choosing a car is a personal preference rather than a statistical battle to determine which car is the best. The car customization comes with color, surface type, additional decal, wheels, antenna, goofy hats and particles for the rocket trail.""Rocket trail?"" you may ask. Well, in Rocket League every car has a Rocket Engine attached to its back allowing to boost itself to greater speed. The best part is that you can jump and shoot yourself into the air with it and being able to fly. This creates gameplay in all three dimensions. Instead of just dribbling the ball on the ground, you can launch yourself into the air and hit the ball before your enemy can. It is not easy and adds a decent learning-curve to the game.The experienceThe game is very polished. The options menu allows key rebinding serparatly for keyboard and controller, very in-depth adjustments to the camera position/behaviour as well as a large choice of grafic options for the Unreal Engine 3.Textures are very detailed, particle effects very well made. The grass on the ground is fantastically animated. Even though the arena/stadiums are the same, there are four different theme versions, ranging from a raining indoor park to a full blown stadium with thousand of people cheering.The cars handle very well, can turn fast and stick to the ground unless you want and tell them to drift. Once airborne keeping the control of the car or wanting to do what you want is difficult but not impossible. The physic engine of the game does it's work very well. The ball itself is predictable and doesn't behave random at all.You unlock new parts for your car customization after completing each game - no matter the outcome of the match. The account progress is ok, but nothing incredible or important. This game shines when it comes to it's gameplay.The sound effects as well as grafical effects while playing or just driving around are incredible enjoyable. Boosting to full speed makes you feel powerful, ramming people and even destroying them creates satisfing explosions. And when scoring a goal the ball explodes and creates a shockwave on which you can ride on with your rocket launcher. Directly afterwards you get a replay of the goal in slow motion. At the end of the game you can save a replay of the entire game and watch it whenever you want.Setting up goals and blocking the ball also feel rewarding by the system and on a team-spirit basis.Since the game has high skill ceiling, experienced players can crush any other ones. The matchmaking system works very well in that regard, that you get matched up with equally good players and even indicates if it doesnt find them and slowly extends it's skill range in order to find players as fast as possible. You can group up to play together in normal and ranked games.You also have the choice of selecting multiple regional servers such as Europe, Oceanic, West- and East-America, as well as queueing up for multiple modes (e.g. 1vs1 and 3v3) at the same time. The game will put you in the first fitting game it can find for you.The game also provides a singleplayer campaign against the AI, as well as tutorials and training for various parts of the game such as defending the goal and scoring goals. For those who just want to get used to the controls or test can hop into the sandbox mode.I also like to mention that you can queue up for an online game from any menu or singleplayer gamemode. So while searching you can play around in sandbox mode.Downloadable Content (Supersonic Fury DLC Update)As announced by Psyonix, the first major update hit Rocket League. I first was disappointed that they want to go the DLC route. Not because i dont like to pay for content, but more because of the bad reputation the word 'DLC' has nowadays, fearing that Rocket League gets looked down for doing this markt strategie. But my fear should vanish.The first DLC just includes two new car and customization items for a small price. The real update includes free stuff for everyone. New map, new specator mode, better ranked play, improved main menu background, and so on. With the new update the 20€ i pay for the game are even more worth it. And Psyonix plans are to keep going, maybe even into the direction of modding and crazy maps.So yes. I am excited for every upcomming Update and DLC.ConclusionI recommend this game to everyone. May it be casual players, those who play in a group to have fun together as well as the ones who like play competitively. Playing this game has the perfect fun/frustration balance and great learning curve.			",51,6,4,2,12,0,5

												Rocket League is one of those rare games that oozes love from its developers. You will sink hours into this game there is no escaping that. With an amazing multiplayer mode that includes split screen (something sorely missing from too many games today)  that you can take online. Great controls , superb physics . and an additive season mode this game is well worth the $20. 10/10			",77,16,3,3,8,1,2

It's great fun when you're on a roll, but when you go up against a team of semi-pros, it can be both frustrating and depressing. But I suppose that can go for any competitive game.

Intro:Rocket League is a sequel to the less-known vehicular football video game Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars developed and published by Psyonix. The game was first released in July 2015 for PC and PS4 and got a Xbox One version earlier this year. There are an OS X and Linux versions planned to be released this year. A lot of people (myself included) had never heard of SARPBC until they tried Rocket League out.Base Concept:The base concept for this game as simple as it gets: combine football with cars and try to defeat the opponent team. The idea sounds pretty simple and many would think that it will be easier to play than actual football games such as FIFA or PES. If you are one of those people, then you're suddenly mistaken.The game is easy to understand but often you'll end up having to put effort into it in order to succeed. It is challenging and usually you will have to fly in air in order to get or shoot the ball. You are awarded XP points which are assigned to you after the end of every match. Those XP points are the ones that make you actually ""level up"" in the game. There are 2 different types of ranks: normal and competitive ones. Normal ones are gathered by levelling up while the competitive ranks are gathered by playing the competitive game modes.Gameplay:The game consists of a couple game modes: standard football ones, basketball (named Hoops) and the chaotic Rumble mode that features around 10 special items you can use to give yourself the advantage while your team has the possession of the ball. Due to the arenas being not as big as they are in real life, having 22 players chasing 1 ball would be, to say the least, too chaotic. For that sake, Psyonix decided to restrict teams to a maximum of four players per team.Matches consisting of 1 to 3 cars are optimal ones while the ones featuring 4 cars per team are, although no less entertaining, reasonably marked as ""Chaos"". Then there are the Hoops and Rumble game modes, first of which is basically basketball combined with cars while the second one represents the already known combination of football and cars, this time with some special effects and items which can help you to score some goals.The game surely is entertaining and even if you were never a fan of either football or racing, this game may take your interest. The game has some collision model problems (not really bugs, but just unoptimized car collisions) which can be noticed in goal replays. Sometimes, you can clearly see the ball flying away even though visually, you didn't actually hit it. That is not a very big problem, though, and it happens only when your car's front is supposed to hit the ball.On the keyboard, the controls feel great and are just like you'd expect them to be. The game features boost pickups which you can use to temporarily speed up your car or for flying like a rocket (obviously representing the name of the game itself). Sadly, the matchmaking is not very optimized and from time to time, a ""semi-pro"" or a ""pro"" ranked player will have to play against an ""expert"" or even a ""master"". That is, of course, not fair.Would be a bad thing to forget the car customization. While Rocket League doesn't support modding, you can customize your cars with tons of different body colors, wheels, trails, antennas and items to put on the top of your car (literally hats for cars).Visuals:Rocket League is running on the Unreal Engine 3. Its visuals are colorful and look simply beautiful. The arenas are filled with different colors (mostly the team colors) and some of them even have country flags hanging around them. All the arenas (excluding the rocket labs) have similar layouts and a pretty unique theme.The 3D main menu is set in one of the arenas and you can rotate the camera to see different angles of your car which is very helpful especially when it comes to car customization. There are tons of different options that can improve the effects in-game or the actual game experience.Verdict:This game is a really awesome example of how an interesting combination of 2 totally different things with great execution can be strong and not require tons of features in order to get players return to it on a daily basis. With over 50K players on a daily basis, this game promises to bring you a lot of fun, excitement and even anger. It's one of those games that are really easy to learn and understand, but very difficult to master. If you do have some time and are looking for a way to burn hours in which you are bored, this is the right thing to go for.The matchmaking needs optimization and there are some features (such as demolishing other players) that are very often (ab)used by other players for the sake of preventing you of defending or scoring, or how many people like to call it - dirty playing. Base Concept: 9.5Gameplay: 9Visuals: 9.2Fun: 9.2Overall: 9.2 ",283,65,12,28,12,5,33

												Psyonix's magnum opus, Rocket League, is one of the most fun games I've had the joy to play. The master of fast-paced, addictive gameplay, the 5 minute matches keep you playing into the early hours of the morning and never failing to keep the action above 60mph! The vertical flexability that the openness of a Rocket League pitch offers is incredible, boasting a Cirque de liberté for you to perform all sorts of zany twists and turns in mid-air, it's remarkable to see glorious goals and superb saves made by some of the insanely talented players. One can better their Rocket League play naturally, by simply enjoying the game, however, the more difficult tricks like; airials, freestyles, dribbling and perfect positioning take some serious skill and precision and are a sight to see in competitive play. The game's perfectly playable with either a controller or mouse 'n' keyboard, so it's up to you to decide how you play. The customisation is great, fine-tuning your Rocket-Powered Battle-Car is fantastic and the options are near endless, offering plenty of choice. However, there is microtransactions. But, these are implemented in one of the best ways I've seen in any game, they're not intrusive or necessary for victory AT ALL, they're simply cosmetic. The free Rumble gamemode is serious fun and it's nice to see the devs frequently adding new features and stadiums to one of the most fun games of 2015. I don't care too much for either cars or football, but I adore Rocket League. Totally worth its full price and it's a steal on sale, highly recommended.			",357,48,13,18,26,1,11

												Rocket League is a completely physics-based fast-paced sports game where cars play soccer. A very simple concept, but it's the most fun you could ever have in a video game. The learning curve is very steep, so you might struggle when you begin, but the game's addictive nature will probably grab you anyway and make you play for hours until you're too tired to even go to sleep, so you play more and you realize you've been playing 5 days non-stop and you're dead. Even though it's such a simple idea, there's so much you can do in this game. If you're a newcomer, don't forget to try flying! (Spoiler alert: It's f***ing awesome!)It also has great potential to become a big e-sports game, something that I'm really looking forward to.The list of features at the moment isn't huge, but hopefully the devs will add more things in future updates like they've promised. (Psyonix always keeps their promises, so I wouldn't worry about it!) The season mode is a great place for new players to practice their skills against the AI, but the online mode is where most of the fun of the game lies. And, the customization is sick. Oh and the insanely cool replay editor! Also new free maps in the future confirmed!All in all this game is very solid, very competitive and fun, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes skill-based games or is into sports.Better than FIFA. 10/10.

												As I lifted myself up from the crusted earth bellow, I realized my grim mistake.I left the comfortable region in which a keeper should plant himself firmly.In the distance I saw my companions on the offensive, rushing back to help me in vain.It was in that moment that I saw it. I would very soon miss the ball and cause my team great pain.My thoughts were of all the other games, in those which I’ve made the very same mistake.Yet the desire to one day succeed was strong and I could not help myself to that leap.As the ball flew passed me, In that direction that I wished it not to. I felt as if death had gripped me.I’ve let my comrades down, failed them and taken a selfish action for a benefit that could only be my own. As the ball graciously embraced the deep fathoms of the net, I was met with the taunts and suggestions of my sexuality. I brushed them off, as a knight brush of the lives he takes in the battlefield.The strange thing is: That I would do it all over again, for one day I will fly through the air like a majestic winged shape, and one day I will hit that ball. My friends will cheer and my enemies will tremble, for thus my rank will be great.			",220,99,3,41,27,2,54

												Wow, wow, wow. I really wasn't aware of this game before it officially launched. How I could miss such a diamond I do not know. Usually I am not that much into racing games, which isn't really too much of a problem since I wouldn't exactly call it a typical racing game. Still it uses familiar driving mechanics and combines it with the most basic soccer rules. 2 teams of rocket-boosted-cars try to catapult, push, nitro-boost or bump an oversized football into the other teams goal. On the ""battlefield"" you find small nodes which add a little to your boost-meter, which is quite limited and you have to carefully time the use of you nitro-boost - if it's time to defend and you find yourself in the other team's half you are not going to get there on time. If the ball is on the way to your opponent's goal you will want to have as much boost as possible to ""kick"" the ball as hard as you can and also to outrace the other players.You can jump and even double-jump with your car, you can flip and turn in any direction whilst in the air in order to maximize your blocking possibilites and to kick the ball with a spinning move of your car's rear. It's hard to describe but play it for 1 hour and you will get what I mean. :)Rocket League is crazy, it involves a lot of skill but does not have a particularly steep learning curve. There are only so many moves you can make and the real challenge is to master them all. Matchmaking works like a charm, new games are found quickly and you can decide wether you want to play ranked or just for the fun of it.I imagine if you play 3v3 together with 2 friends on your team this game gets even greater.The only things I would wish for in future updates are a little more map variation and some different game modes.Since there is pretty much only one stadium with several different textures and lighting, things could get a tad repetitive after a while. I can really see the potential of ramps being in there, maybe some minor upgrades/boosts ready for pickup and so on... You could go really crazy expanding the existing formula.Other than that - I can recommend this without any shadow of a doubt!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rocket League is a physics based football type game(no I will not call it soccer). It is actually a sequel to a game called Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars.  Rocket League was released in early July 2015 on the PC and PlayStation 4. The gameplay is very simple, you control a rocket powered car and you use it to play a game of football. To many this may sound boring and unfun if you aren't a fan of either cars, or football - let me reassure you though, even if you aren't a fan, I guarantee you will have fun whilst playing Rocket League. The game is highly addictive and it will keep you playing until the early hours of the morning with that ""Just one more match"" feel to it. Rocket League has a single player mode, an online multiplayer mode and a local multiplayer mode. I haven't played the single player as the multiplayer is completely where the action is at. The match making system works flawlessly, you will not have any problems finding a game, as of right now there are over 20,000 people playing. Each match lasts 5 minutes, and can consist of teams of 1, 2, 3 or 4 people. Personally I enjoyed the more hectic type matches of 3 or 4. Another nice little bonus is that Rocket League also works cross-platform, meaning you could end up being in a match with PS4 players which is one of the first I've seen run this type of system. The controls are very simple, and you can pick them up in a matter of seconds.It is highly recommended that you play this game with a controller though, I have not heard any success stories of people using keyboard and mouse to play. Graphically, Rocket League is an awesome game to look at, just the right amount of lens flare, smooth animations and gorgeous looking backgrounds and arenas to play in. The game is ran using Unreal Engine 3, and it has been pushed to look stunning. I wouldn't exactly say Rocket League to be a difficult game, it has a very pick up and play vibe to it, but it will take you a couple of hours to become a real asset to your team mates, rather than just driving back and forth on the map chasing the ball. I have been playing Rocket League for almost six hours now, I am by no means a master at this game, and it feels as if I am only scratching the surface of the skill level you can reach. Like I said, this game is highly addictive, you will really struggle to put it down after you boot it up. The fast paced action and quick matches keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time. This game runs as smooth as a babies bottom, the 60 fps, high resolutions and customize-able graphics make this a really PC game that is highly worth your time.' We are looking at one of the games of the year right here.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must play

Release7th July 2015Genre(s)Racing, SportsDeveloperPsyonix, IncPublisherPsyonix, IncMode(s)Single-Player, Multiplayer, Co-OpTL:DRA rather unique idea of cars and football (or soccer) together to create one of the best competitive games ever made. If you're someone like me, who doesn't like cars or football, you may be put off by this at first, but it's definitely not what it seems, it's no wonder it's so popular. Definitely worth it!Now for the full reviewRocket League is a game where you drive around in a rocket powered car trying to score goals. Sounds boring doesn't it? It really isn't. Rocket League suprised me. It's not one of those generic sports games I was anticipating it to be. It's a really addicting and competitive game. The game is highly physics based, meaning you'll see cars jumping and flying around. Realistic!Your team can have up to at least 4 players, with matches lasting five minutes. The goal is basically what you do in football/soccer, score goals. The team with the most goals wins. This can be a challenge sometimes as it does require team-work, unless it's 1 v 1. There definitely isn't a shortage of players, with thousands of players on Steam AND it's cross platform capability with players from the PS4, which isn't really seen that much in games. Finding a game shouldn't be too difficult either, the matchmaking system's perfect.The game highly advises you to use a controller, except when I started playing, my controller stopped working, so I resorted to using the keyboard. Honestly, it wasn't that hard for me to adapt. It does take time, for some people, but after that the controls become pretty simple, though I would still recommend using a controller, as there are plenty of people who struggle with the keyboard and mouse.The game isn't just multiplayer, there is a single player and a co-op mode. In single player, you are able to access a mode called Season. This puts you with your own unique team, and places you in a tournament against bots. I haven't really played much of it but it seemed pretty simple. If you want the most out of your money I would stick to the multiplayer as it's much more entertaining and challenging.There are quite a few different maps in Rocket League. Each one looks amazing and colourful, with quite a bit of background detail which isn't a suprise due to it being made on Unreal Engine 3. Despite all the activity going on in the match, performance was never an issue. This game runs rather smooth for what it is. There are different types of cars, all of which are fully customizable, ranging from colours to patterns to wheels etc. You can unlock these different customizations from completing matches. Not to mention, there's plenty of dlc that add different cars and customization items, that have quite reasonable price tags.Rocket League is one of those games where you can loose track of time playing it, and I'm glad I replayed it after months of it sitting around in my library. It's highly addicting and I can see why it's so popular. It also has such an amazing soundtrack that plays in the background of the main menu, with some really memorable songs. If you have spare money, I'd definitely say this is worth it, a near flawless game. The DLC seems quite reasonable as well.Pros- Highly addicting- Amazing detail- Highly customizable- Great performance- Amazing soundtrackCons- Problems with keyboard controls

Think again.You think you have time to study? Think again.If your parents don't know or fully understand the concept of not being able to pause an online game, then I have some bad news for you.Seriusly, can a game be flawless? F**k yeah it can! From the gameplay to the soundtrack, you will love every bit of this game. Rocket league is also one of the very few games to be an officially sponsored E-sport shortly after it's release.Solid 10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quick, competitive gameplay with easy to understand mechanics makes rocket league a fun game with high replayability. It is clear to an active player that the developers truly care about the game and constantly release features everyone can enjoy. Even if you pick this game up just to play locally with some friends, it will be worth every penny. Every new patch has new features that are exciting and keep me coming back time and time again. In matches, it's rare to feel cheated out of a game due to RNG. Even if you don't want to play, the simple premise makes watching rocket league quite enjoyable at any skill level. I highly suggest playing this game as much as you possibly can.			",258,44,14,18,29,2,47

												1,500 hours in and the game is even more enjoyable than it was when I began. While it takes time to master specific skills the outcome is worth it, and makes the game continuously fun. The community is so much better than other games, not as toxic, more friendly, more fun, The developers listen to the community and constantly try to improve the game to make it more exciting. It's not pay to win, so anyone can do just as well without spending any extra money. It is also optional to play with either keyboard + mouse (like myself for 1,450 hours) or use a controller. While a controller allows for more specific angles, the game is still as fun without it. You can still get a professional level on keyboard + mouse, it is just preference, however for people starting out I would suggest using a controller if it's available as it CAN allow for some better shots.Overall a  fantastic game, definitely one I'm not giving up on anytime soon.

												When i bought Rocket League i didnt really now what to expect. 3 hours later i was still playing it with a smile on my face.Really addictive game. Don't expect much of the crossplay between PS4 and PC. At the moment of this review its not possible to invite a friend from ps4. The more games you play the more accessories you will get. Had some problems with the servers (lag and randomly server lost) but after the latest patch i didnt have that problem anymore.Good work Psyonix !!!			",247,49,10,22,48,5,45

												A really fun and addicting game, that is easy to get into but hard to master. I wish I had played this when released already :), but better later than never :D. A game about cars flying mindlessly after a ball. I've played around 25h and still have so much to get better at lol, like doing high flying or wall jumps. I've been playing football and racing games for many times and this is different in a cool way. Lots of skin customizations for your cars, ranks, awesome OST and different game modes. Most enjoyable to play with friends <(^_^)>.The matchmaking sometimes adds pretty high ranked opponents. It's good practice though to play against those.Recommended for everyone :D.

												I have to admit I kind of scoffed at the concept of a soccer game with cars, but rocket cars? The rockets add a layer of grace and skill that is hard to describe and is best experienced live. There are literally hundreds of Wow! and OMG! moments to be had. Rocket League has turned into one of my favorite multiplayer games, and I don't even like soccer!The game has a large, but linear learning curve as you progress to the higher ranks. Start off learning the fundamentals like basic offense, defense, and blocking shots. Then as you get better, you improve dribbling skills, centering techniques, team positioning, plus hard and soft shots. As you advance further, you become proficient at wall shots, aerials, epic saves, and bad shot recovery. I have played nearly 200 hours and I still feel like I'm learning and improving my game.I find the game intensely addicting with its 5 minute matches. Once one game is over, I'm ready to start another and it's almost impossible to just play a single game. As my skills improve, it fuels my incentive to keep playing more.They recently added a hockey modification which is amazingly good as well. I'd venture to say I like it even better than the original game.I can't praise Rocket League enough. It has the right mixture of speed, adrenaline, and fun.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												Still better than Lucioball (Overwatch). Hah.. just kidding, Rocket League it's a must just because is so fluid and awesome. I'm going to tell you a short story and then you'll buy it okay?I was at a party. A friend of mine got old and threw a party at his house. We played Rocket League at his party on his Playstation 4. I fell in love with the game. On my way back home, in the cab, I was thinking only about this awesome game. As soon as I reached home, I opened steam (it was 5 in the morning), bought it and played it till 8 AM. It was THAT GOOD! One of the best experiences in gaming is called Rocket League. 10/10You can play it cross-platform aswell ",1240,350,64,132,90,15,216

Posted: June 22, 2016
OverviewRocket League is a very popular, iconic multi-platform game that doesn't do much, but it gets by formidably with the few it has. Speaking as someone not interested in either cars nor football (Yes, football. The real one!), this game is incredibly addictive, and worthwhile if you have a few friends to play with.The Pros:Incredibly Fun - Simple concept, easy to get the hang of but with a very high skill ceiling to keep you motivated in playing for a long time. Scoring some trick shot goals or plain luck bounces of the wall both fill the adrenaline in your soul. Winning is rewarding, and losing just makes you want a rematch.Great Visuals - The level of detail is pretty decent, and cranking up the settings at maximum really gives it a nice feel in terms of visuals. The car models are very detailed, weather effects are decent, and praise the Gods for the adjustable FoV!Customization - Playing unlocks car parts to customize your ride with. You can unlock several car bodies, paint types, wheels, hats (yes, TF2 style), exhaust particles and antennas. There are loads of possibilities and you can feel the car is truly yours. The only gripe I have with this is that you cannot save multiple ""load-outs"" and you cannot have a different setup based on team color. (Some accessories look godly on Red but awful on Blue and vice versa.)Game Customization - You can host private matches with all sorts of modifiers, from gravity, to ball size, to boost speed, time and goal limits, anything! Go crazy and experiment!Good Influx of Content - About once a month or two, new content is added. A new map here, a few more antennas there, a new game mode sprinkled once every season. The Cons:Unfair Input Method Balance - Unfortunately for us PC Purists out there, this game was designed for controllers. Specifically, the boost flying. Doing it on a keyboard is next to impractical, it is very unintuitive and hard to master. You can still play very well with a keyboard, but face against a team of controller users and you will be in for a bad time. The simplest fix that I CANNOT BELIEVE they didn't implement: The option to sort matchmaking for different input methods.Horrendous Matchmaking - The system is mainly broken. If you play ranked, you will occasionally find yourself in a match with people 30 levels above you, because they play with a newbie friend that is unranked. It seems the game gives the team rating by calculating the average ranks of the members, and ignores Player level completely. So if players who are Veterans + but did not play ranked will be matched with anyone with their same rank.Community is a bit Toxic - Not being PC or defensive, just a tad warning that you will get the (albeit maturer than) CoD attitude of ""lol newb get rekt"" from time to time.Paid DLC-specific Achievements - There are new car DLCs to buy and fortunately they are purely cosmetic... but they decided to add achievements to them, so achievement hunters beware! You can't perfect this game without taking out your wallet because they decided it's a real challenge to ""Win an Online Match with this new Car!"".ConclusionDespite the shortcomings, this game is incredibly fun. But do not purchase alone! Convince three friends to get it too and buy the 4-pack. Aside from better price, you will get a vastly superior experience when playing with people you know.If you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

												Rocket League is an immensely fun game. It is easy to get into and will draw you in from the get-go.RL is great for casual play if you want to just have some quick fun, and has a very high skill ceiling for those that like to invest the time and effort into their competitive games.I usually judge games based off a price to play time ratio, and this game is well worth the $20 if you ask me.

												Don't let my hours discourage you. I have been playing this game on PS4 since it's release date of July 2015.Soccer with cars. I don't know how that concept works, but it does. Perfectly. Rocket League is the gold standard of a competitive sports game. It is super easy for anyone to just pick up a controller and play. The controls are simple, as well as the core gameplay. It's a great concept. Anybody can play it, but only when you take the time practicing to learn how to predict the ball, where to hit the ball to direct it, and how to fly is when the real game shines.The customization in Rocket League is wonderful. Upon just starting, you're given few cars, decals, wheels, etc. As you play, more customization options are randomly unlocked upon completing a match. The ways you can customize cars is endless, with no two cars looking the same. The customization has no effect on the stats of each car, each is purely cosmetic. On the topic of stats, the bodies of each car do have individual stats. Hitboxes, turn radius, and acceleration times all become a factor when choosing a car that suits you. Microtransactions do exist in this game in the form of Crates. Much like CS:GO, you purchase keys to open said crates, which contain items from common to Exotic. Items in crates tend to be much cooler looking than the items that are included in the vanilla game, with moving decals and electric wheels being two of the many highlights. Fortunately, everything in these crates are purely cosmetic, meaning there is no Pay-to-win factor in Rocket League.Now, onward to the gameplay, the most unique aspect of Rocket League. At its core, each match consists of two teams trying to score more goals into the opponents net to win. However, with the addition of boost and the ability to drive on walls, the game becomes much more than that. Pressing the jump button while in the air will propel your car into any direction you are moving, allowing you to hit the ball with a little more force. This mechanic is great for putting the ball where you want it to go, with direct control of where your car is. The driving in this game feels smooth and crisp, with a handbrake allowing very tight turns. Boost allows you to accellerate at a much quicker speed, and put more power into your shot. The boost mechanic really comes into play when the boost is used to thrust your car off the ground, turning your car into an airplane of sorts. This results in some truly beautiful shots and rewards the players who take the time to practice this move. Just hitting the ball can give satisfaction, and after countless hours of playing, I still tense up before I'm about to hit the ball.Upon scoring, the ball explodes into the net, throwing any player close enough accross the pitch. This is very satisfying, and it accompanied with a replay of the goal in slow motion, allowing you to see all of the glory (or B.S., in some cases). Quick chats are available such as ""Nice Shot!"" and ""Wow!"", although expect to get slightly tilted as ""What a save!"" will be spammed if you miss a save.Teams in Rocket League can have up to 4 players, with game modes of 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4. The 4v4 game mode is a little too chaotic for my liking (Which is probably why it is called 'chaos'). 2v2 and 3v3 are undoubtedly the best game modes, as this is where team play really shines. A pass to a teammate that leads to a goal (Even though it was probably not intentional) is a spectacular feeling, especially when shared with friends. There are also variations of these game modes, like Hoops, a basketball version of the game with hoops instead of goals. Snow Day, in which a hockey puck replaces the ball, and Rumble, where every 10 seconds you get a powerup ranging from a Glove to punch the ball and spikes that make the ball stick to your car. These game modes are fun from time to time, but I don't spend too much time playing them.Rocket League is one of those rare games in which a competitive mode is implemented into the game. Competitive has 4 game modes: Duel (1v1), Doubles (2v2), Standard (3v3), and Solo Standard (3v3, however no parties are allowed). Included with these game modes are ranks to measure your skill. The ranks range range from Bronze to Platinum to Champion. Within each rank are 3 sub-categories. For example, within Gold there is Gold I, Gold II, and Gold III, with I being the lowest and III being the highest. Furthermore, within these categories are divisions. Divisions range from I-IV, with IV being the highest. If you were to start out as Gold I division II, winning a game would bring you to division III, and the opposite for a loss. Once you pass division IV, you move up in categorym making you Gold II. During Season 3 of competitive play I managed to make it up to Champion, although it took lots of time and lots of patience.Unfortunately, with all other competitive games, smurfs are an issue in Rocket League. It sucks, because you could be one win away from getting that new rank, and then a smurf comes and sets you back down a few divisions. Also, with the implementation of the new ranks in Competitive, there are many high level players being placed into really low ranks. This is not only unfair to the players who get ranked low, but to the people they play against. I'm hoping this issue gets fixed, but it seems to be a problem every time a new season begins.Updates to this game are very frequent. New content is delivered almost monthly, with new maps, cars, game modes, and crates. The development team knows how to handle a game and keep their community happy, which is refreshing to see.Rocket League is a fantastic game. It's a game that I can constantly come back to, because it never gets repetitve. The mechanics are some of the best compared to similar games and with the competitve scene making a rise, I think this game will stick around for a long time.PROS:- Easy to pick up- Mechanics are phenomenal- Balanced- Microtransactions are purely cosmetic- Competitive play is implemented into the game- Customization is endless- Frequent updates- Good community- Never repetitive- Little to no bugs- Gameplay is just pure funCONS:- Smurfs- Ranking system is messed up- ""What a save!""

												Day 1 - ""Wow! This game is fun!""Day 25 - ""Wow! Those pro players are amazing!""Day 91 - ""I must get better.""Day 180 - ""I've played every day since I bought this game. Send help.""Day 384 - ""This game literally inhabits my dreams.  Carball is all I know.  "" In all seriousness... This game is ridiculously fun. Unlike a sports simulation where you simply press a button to pass or shoot, you're given total control over a Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Car. You physically ram your vehicle into the ball to dribble, pass, and shoot. The concept is ludicrous and results in one of the best games I've personally ever played.At low levels, the game is slow paced as people become accustomed to the mechanics, but never does it cease to harbor massive levels of enjoyment. As the game opens up (from your skill and grasp of the controls), you'll start to see the game in a totally different way. Everywhere on (and above) the field is now open to play, and you can start creating teamplay opportunities you never thought possible. The game progressives like such throughout your time playing, and the skill ceiling is incredibly high (if not non-existant). I'll spare you my ranting, but regardless of winning, losing, or who I was playing with or against, it has always been a good time. On a different note, the game is almost nearly as amazing to watch as it is to play. The ""Rocket League Championship Series""[twitch.tv] is the official Psyonix/Twitch partnered eSports event. Alongside the pro's, there is competition at nearly every level. The community is bright and active, and the devs are some of the most interactive and supportive creators I have ever seen in the game industry. Please take a chance, grab some friends, and give this game a try. It will be fun. And once you're hooked, be sure to come hang out on the subreddit or check out the dedicated fan site (http://rocket-league.com) to learn more about the community and rapidly growing eSports scene.

												It's super fun, it's a blast with friends, and there's splitscreen multiplayer for a PC game for once. I love this game and I already bought a shirt with the logo.If you have a dual monitor set-up, I recommend you look into changing the game's resolution to span both screens for 2-player.

So I feel like I've played enough of this game now to write a review...The good.The gameplay: While simple, is very fun. It's soccer, with cars, but the cars have boosters, and can fly :). It's great and engaging, it challenges you to learn new techniques to stay ahead of your opponents. The feeling when you hit that first aerial goal is amazing..trust me ;).Graphics and performance: The graphics aren't anything to write home about, but this is a good thing in this case. This game runs beautifully on most systems, low or high end alike. I have seen a system with 2gb of ram and a dual core cpu with a gtx 440 gpu run this game on medium settings at 40fps. On my medium spec system it runs at 80-100fps on max settings.Longevity: As mentioned before, this game challenges you to learn new things and experiment to grow in skill. I always feel like I am getting better, and not just stagnating in skill.DLC: Best cars in the game are free! DLC just for cosmetic purposes!There are of course, other good elements to this game, those however are the main points in my opinion. I'd rather alert you to the potential difficulties in the remainder of this review.The bad.Matchmaking: The matchmaking does a decent job of pairing you with good opponents. BUT! If two players of unequal skill levels are playing together in a party, it will find a match to the skill level of the better player. This makes it unpleasent for the lower tier player. Ping is NOT at all accounted into the matchmaking. I live in an area far from the server locations, I am used to getting 200+ ping. Anything under 250 ping is playable. Sometimes however I can enter a ranked match with ping in excess of 600, this is not playable, and is basically a garunteed derank. This won't be a problem for most people, but for those of us living in the dark parts of the world, beware! Not the smoothest experience.Community: While not nearly as bad as the CSGO community, it has it's fair share of trollers and salty kids. This should be a given with a large multiplayer game, but it's liable to get worse as the game grows, so take note!VerdictIs Rocket League a good game? ... Yes.Is it fun? ... Yes, especially with friends.Is it worth the price? ... Yes, definitely, but if you struggle financially, wait for a sale, as is the case with all games.Should YOU buy it? ... If you like the idea and want to try it out, yes. If you don't like racing or soccer, you may still love it (as is the case with myself), if you want a serious racing or soccer game though, look elsewhere.HIGHLY RECCOMENDED			",168,28,1,16,10,0,5

Hey guys, it's Super Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle Cars...2? Or I guess Rocket League?Rocket League is one of those ideas you're surprised has not been done yet. But it's totally been done before. What Rocket League does is refine, simplify, and intensify.Pros:Stellar and easy-to-grasp controls that invoke ""Easy to learn but hard to master""Stellar visuals and optimization on PC. The grass looks magnificant!A good variety of cosmetics to use.Absolutely god damn fun. Matches are energetic, intense, filled with determination, and sometimes insane errors.A neato soundtrack. Personal favorites are Whiplash and Fireworks.Nitpicks:The game does not have a lot of unique modes beyond it's simple Soccer mode, with several varients like Snow Day.Cons:The ranking system (As of Season 1) is absolutely broken. Those who have fallen far behind the ladder have absolutely zero chance to rank up. As of Season 2, the ranking system will be swapped to something like CS:GO, so this will definitely fix these problems.As with any multiplayer game, it's supplement AI are not the best to play with, making modes like Season not so enjoyable to play. Thankfully, most online matches normally don't involve them, so they don't affect the game in a similar fashion that bots do in CS.The ReviewRocket League is the result of a well-refined concept that's made it's debut back in 2008 as Super-Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle Cars. While SARPBC had a whole lot more modes, maps and content, Rocket League is a lot more light in content, but that's because that was something the devs didn't focus on. Instead, Rocket League is a much more refined and focused game.The game plays and feels amazing, and this is because of what's changed since then. The cars have weight to them, which gives the player the feeling that they have much more control.It's team-based play is also very solid, because you're playing as an individual player, there's a lot of real coordination and technique that makes it so different from playing, say Fifa. It's so refreshing to play a sport game that brings out something that most of those games don't, and it's the indidviduality of the players. The want to stand out among others, or to stay behind and support your friends, that's the ingenuity of Rocket League.It does lack in content however. It may be offputting that the simple, Soccer-based mode is really the only mode in the game, and a lot of the maps are in a similar layout, but that's what makes this game feel so refined. It's excusable because it's so fun to continue playing match after match. It's like Soccer; It never gets old.It's presentation is solid too. It has a surprisingly beast soundtrack, with the likes of Hollywood Principle stealing the show. It's visuals, while not on par with big Triple AAA games, looks crisp and beautiful. The grass on the fields look mighty damn shiny, and the cars models are smiplistic and detailed.Psyonix did a fantastic job taking a good concept, execute it once, and refine it years later into a much more enjoyable experience. Rocket League may not have a ton of maps, or game modes, but what it has is a game that will continues to amaze (and♥♥♥♥♥♥ me to all sorts of levels.TL;DR - Rocket League is a energetic and satisfying game that feels more like soccer then games like Fifa. And that's weird.For more reviews on all sorts of games, follow  Lots' o Giveaway's group curations and reviews  here! ",320,71,5,32,10,3,19

												    To be honst, this game actually brought me a lot of fun. It's a very relaxing game, and it's a good choice for me to have a rest when I'm tired about ohter games. I'll never be tired of this creative game.     But here comes a terrible news, this game had been introduced to China. Yes, you may think that I ought to be happy because I'm a Chinese player as well as living in China. But on the contrary, the agent in China is Tencent, it's a very famous game company but also with a lot of awful history. Moreover, recently Tencent wanted to popularize a game platform call ""TGP"", to make it like a Chinese Steam. And not long ago, TGP had intorduced Stardew Valley to China and had converted it into Chinese. So problems arisen. TGP(Tencent) did not chinesize the game themself, they just copied the code, the patch which were chinesized by other inofficial workers without authorization and permission. They wouldn't not pay for their thievery, and those workers could not get the help as well. no laws and economic capability	    Besides, Tencent had done many sick things. Let take Monster Hunter OnLine as an instance, in addition to make profits, they had opened ""closed test"" several times(yum-yum, for the information I searched online, it had ""closed test"" for nearly three years). And ever time the test opened, they would sale the invitation codes as a part of their profits. And meanwhile, they would sale props such as StaminAidDrug, sale appearance to players, and the only way you could get it was to purchase them by money. (not the coins in game, but in reality)	   They made it like a offical  version, but actually it was one time of the ""colsed test"".    Not only the MHOL like what I said above, Blade and Soul, The Magic Blade(a game produced by Tencent themself) had all suffered this conditon. And when the game released officially, they had made enough profits and then let the game half-dead.    So, I truly appreciate the developer brought this game to Chinese distrct, but I do not wish the agent are Tencent(TGP). I don't know what will happen before long, maybe charge a lot of money, or maybe change the data, or maybe release a car with Chinese characteristics and charge a barrel of money  yes, Tencent had done this before. They created a powerful prop and charged it for 998 RMB(nearly 140 Dollar)	, or maybe nothing. But I think many players also do not want to see Tencent(TGP) to introduce this game to China.    At last, I have to give the developer, not the game, a negative conmment.			",47,20,0,6,4,0,4

												10/10 ­- I Hate Racing Games, I Hate Soccer Games; I LOVE Them Together!I never like reviewing games that everyone has played but I must check this off the list and get it done! Rocket Leauge is one of the most impressive games to come out in the last few years in my humble opinion. The replay value is nuts; you can keep playing almost indefinitely without getting bored. There is a pretty big learning curve but once you get the hang of things the rewards are great!This game is a soccer game but instead of sending troops into battle you send 3­4 cars into the arena! What could possibly make this better?! How about strapping rockets onto the back of your ride! There is a great deal of skill involved but even if you suck you will have tons of fun. I have worked my way from easy to hard on single player and I felt like my skills were pretty solid, winning most matches. I quickly realized though I’m still not that good; other players are always better and the difference in skill levels are vast! So don’t be discouraged when you start getting whooped on multiplayer!Overall, this is a real gem! Make sure you computer is strong enough for multiplayer because it will definitely use more resources. You can often find this game for about $15 now so lookout for that deal!

												Car soccer.. What a time to be alive.It's a fantastic game. It's such a unique experience, and it's unfortunate that I never really took the time to play SARPBC. Apart from any game I have owned, it is a competitive multi-platform sports game that you will have copious amounts of fun playing -- Whether you're on the winning OR losing team.This game has seen a lot of negative feedback lately due to the crate system being introduced. Personally, I never really liked the idea of it, but do keep in mind, there is absolutely no Steam Community Market involved.Keys to unlock crates are $1.49, and the crates seem to drop fairly often. If nothing else, it's an OK way to fund further development of the game and increase prize pools for RLCS.Those of you that are just SO upset with Psyonix about crates, and threaten to uninstall-C'mon. We really got the best flavor of sh*t sandwich here, if sh*t has to be eaten.The animated decals and wheels are pretty darn sweet.Warning to all:Parts of the community and certain individuals that you will meet can be VERY toxic and degrading in online matches.That's pretty much the internet for you, but I feel that it stems from something more specific;A lot of CS:GO diehards play this on the side with their clanmates, and that kind of vindictive and immature mentality leaks in to this game due to the competitive nature.In closing..Bring some friends, keep your ballchasing to a minimum, and dive in to this game.Prepare for a wild learning curve and a boatload of fun.

												TL;DR ---------Its addictive and my most played game to date. Please buy it in or out of a sale :)So, I was going to write a review at 100 hours but another 100 later and its... Been a few days... What can I say, the game is worth it at full price PLUS DLC (I have most DLC -- 3 are needed to 100% achievements). This game is very easy to pick up and there are tons of skills to master the game -- from dribbling to advanced aerials -- if you want to play it competitively or just improve. Plus there are tons more to come with Rocket Labs introduced and there is a basketball mode in the making as I write this review :)---------Pros --  Great customization with base game and/or with DLC. You can customize paint, wheels, car body, the boost, hats etc! Great common and uncommon drops Gameplay is steady, you can easily play with keyboard and mouse or controller (I personally use an Xbox One controller) Love the soundtrack  Achievements are easy but maybe a little bit of a grind for some  The UI is clean and well set out -- there is even a nice quick chat feature (Nice shot, Centering, Defending etc) You can save replays to watch later or upload to youtube It's so much fun to play alone in 1v1, matchmaking in 2v2/3v3/4v4 or with friends Community is mostly friendly, you can now report... the rest...  The devs are great, they are constantly changing the game with a new ranked system and maps etc!  Great training modes and multiple levels of difficulty of AI to practice offline or before/in between a matchWell... You get the point with the pros...Cons  Achievements and little content in the DLC does not feel worth it but forces you to buy if you want to 100% the game... DLC isn't needed so not a big deal. But hey... Batmobile DLC... GET IT!  I have had maybe 2 crashes and a few bad connections in my time, but it reconnects you to the match you were in so you don't lose XP Conclusion... Buy the game. Its awesome. I've had a blast and there will be many more hours of fun to come! The game will only get better from here! Whoops... Nice shot! 10/10 <3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm going to keep this review short and sweet.It's amazing, for the price, the specifications, it's all great. It's very easy to run on the highest settings, it doesn't require experience for you to pick up the basics and jump into the competetive side of this title, it's fun and enjoyable and very replayable.You are given a customization item after every match (If you don't disconnect) which is awesome as it makes you want to play more!You can play: 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and my favourite, 4v4.Seriously, buy this game, you don't need to like Football (Soccer) to enjoy this game. It's just fun.9/10.Con: The servers are slightly laggy at times, but i'm sure this will be looked upon.			",326,65,12,33,25,2,35

												Rocket League is basically football (Soccer) with a car BUT WAIT.... The cars are supersonic, they're acrobatic, they're rocket powered and, they're battle cars! This game is unbelievably fun, even if you dont like this sort of game, i'm yet to meet anyone who has a bad word to say about Rocket League. This is a game that anyone can pick up, no matter what your skill level is, however the skill cap for this game is incredibly high, so it's fun for the casual gamer and the hardcore gamers. I would reccommend this to literally anyone, and i challenge you to play it and not like it!10/10 A game i will player for hundreds of hours!			",46,2,5,14,23,0,9

												Well, i'm sure my hours (5000+ as of now...send help) speak for my testimony when I say: this game is perfect.I've had a hard time finding a game to sink my time into in the past due to story conflicts and other issues. As for Rocket League? It's simple, it's well made, and it's a blast.The five minute rounds offer an ADHD filled event of rocket powered cars soaring through the air, slamming into one another, and explosive balls when you score! You can save replays to go back and watch your impressive goals, or to make beautiful videos. Different roles await: do you fancy yourself as the dashing striker who brings your team to victory? Or perhaps the demolition expert  who pushes your rivals to the breaking point and opens up opportunites to score? Or even the goalie, denying the enemy the sweet sweet taste of success. JUMP ON IN!PROS:-Full car cuztomization-Rocket Powered Acrobatic Aerial Capabilities!-Vibrant graphics-Intuitive replay system-1v1- 4v4 Online play-2-4 Player split screen action!-Season mode-Ranked online!-Demolition-Training modes-Kind and open Devs!-Incoming DLC including maps from SARPBC!-ONLY $20! (Free on PS4)CONS:-Slight lag spikes depending on region.-There's people who don't have this game yet.			",166,16,5,11,24,3,11

												Do you have 5 minutes to play a match of Rocket League? Just five minutes of fast, exciting, and competitive action. Three hours later, you’ll find time for another match. Rocket League is a fantastic multiplayer game with simple mechanics and a tremendous learning curve. It is easy to play and hard to master. You drive a rocket car and hit a ball into a goal. On a basic level it requires timing hits, simple passing, and good positioning. More advanced techniques include aerials, dribbling and pinching. Hitting goals is satisfying but you are always searching for that perfect match with good cooperation. With many skills to master, it is a game that provides reward after many hours. While there is some luck involved, such as when balls are contested, skill usually wins out. Rocket League is a game of exceptional value and you only need 5 spare minutes.			",264,47,14,13,8,0,17

												I remember back when I was a kid and got my first RC Car.It was an epic moment that I'll never forget.Now I can enjoy that exiting feeling combined with the sportsI like, football. The idea is genuine and the concept is well done and simple. Hit an ridiculous large ball with parts of your car to transport it into the oppenen's goal.The physics giving a good feeling. You need a bit of timeto get the ball movement at start. The different cars to choose are only cosmetic besides the more or less ""hitbox"".I think the fair environment is part of the big success.No pay to win or other advantages. Matchmaking is most times quick .One thing I would wish for is an option not to join alreadyrunning matches.Afterall I would say that the game is worth the price.I had hours of fun playing together with friends.Who is looking for kind teammates can write on my wallto request an invite for my new RL dedicated groupcalled ""Rocket League Fair Play"".

												Football With CarsYou can buy DLC, trade items, play 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 or 4v4 modes. Even hockey and basketball make it into this game. You got so many options to play with it's great. Freestyle goals, funny goals, stunts, saves, etc.So many great memories can be had from this game.However it's not flawless, one thing you need to be careful of, is scamming.You are your own guard for scams. Read a guide on how to avoid scammers, as the items in this game are worth alot and anyone can be a scammer so watch yourself. Toxic people are a problem, this game has over 25 million players, alot are toxic, alot are scammers, alot are rage quiters etc. You want to avoid a toxic player? Simple solution. ""Mute"" them when things go south. Done, no more cursing, swearing etc. All with the click of a button.All in all, this game I would recommend.			",3,4,0,1,0,0,1

Product received for free
After 250 hours...Rocket League is a multiplayer game of angles and timing. The only difference here is that you use a car to hit a ball. Playing for a long time doesn't guarantee you becoming skilled, but you'll have a solid base and hopefully don't repeat the same mistakes you made when you first started playing it. Most people will let you know about it, using chat commands sarcastically or call you whatever swear words you can think of. I don't want people to be put off by this, cos it's something you can expect from any multiplayer game, but since the teams are smaller than in FPS games, you get a bigger whiff of the hatred thrown in your direction and the guilt from making a mistake is higher, cos most games are 2v2 or 3v3. Therefore your teammates also have a lower tolerance for mistakes, so get used to losing a teammate when you mess up, even with them risking a time penalty in competitive mode. 1v3 or 2v3 matches can build character or completely throw you off your game, but that's all that Rocket League has ever been, a game of skill, not a cutesy football game with cars.Recently they added a custom training mode, which was long overdue, cos personally I lack the imagination to grow as a player, so I need these new tutorials to get a sense of how all these tricks work and there's a lot of them. A few hundred hours ago I thought once I master aerials I will be set, but consistently executing well-timed aerials is the bare minimum of Rocket League and I can't even manage that most of the time. I swear I'm still making the same mistakes I made when I first started, cos one thing, I'm so used to using ball cam that I'm often missing shots on the ground and in the air as well. In a way, I've painted myself to a corner and I'm stuck in a limbo of ascending and descending between Prospect I and II in Solo Standard. I've actually regressed in my playstyle and stopped taking risks, which freezes your judgement and makes you prone to even more mistakes. No matter how much hatred or disappointment is expressed at your expense, never forget that the real goal here is to have fun.All this depressing stuff aside, Rocket League is incredibly fun, otherwise I wouldn't still be playing it. You always want to get better at it. If it weren't for the incredibly responsive and accurate controls, this would not have been the success that it is. Being focused enough to anticipate every move, the trajectory of the ball and to perfectly time your shot is the entire game.			",207,30,4,5,7,0,3

												Rocket League:~~~~~~~~~~~~  Have you ever imagined in your wildest dreams combining indoor Soccer (Football) and Mattel cars? Well, someone did just that and came up with “Rocket League!” Turn on your engine and jump into a 2 vs 2, 3 vs 3 or even a 4 vs 4 online to score the goal of the season! It is just a mad house this game and I would strongly recommend to go through the tutorial to give you the heads up. Use your power up to pick up speed and launch your car into the air attempting a 360 degree frontward flip and strike this huge ball at the perfect angle to score a goal. But wait, your teammates are trying to do exactly the same thing and you all miss the ball! Now you have to drive back to defend your own net and hope that your opponents are as skilful as you are. You will accumulate points by scoring goals, clearing the balls, passing the ball in the centre, making an assist or, like myself, manage to do a hat trick. And to be honest, it was a fluke! Still, I managed to be the man of the match! Sorry, let me rephrase that -  I managed to be the car of the match! These points will help you to unlock new cars, wheels, paints, hats(???). Yes hats and other stuff.The graphics are very good and the gameplay is fantastic. Great physics!One small downside is the frequent connection issue. I do not get kicked out of the game but keep missing out my goal of the season!Positives:~~~~~~~  -	Great graphics and physics-	Easy to access an online game-	Innovative and fun to play-	Trading cards-	AchievementsNegatives:~~~~~~~~  -	Frequent connection issue Whoever came up with this idea is a mad genius!10/10 (even with the connection issue)MORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HEREFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE ",1057,380,38,96,129,8,156

												I was recommended this game after offhandedly mentioning it to a friend, and it ended up being one of my favourite games of the year.  Where to start? It's multiplayer focused football with cars. Some people seem to dismiss it as a simple game that will get boring fast, but I would disagree. The game's core mechanics are so well polished that playing feels fluid and natural from the get-go, especially if you play racing games. The car handling is very simple, nothing like the likes of GRID or GTA IV. I think this handling system is good for the game, complex handling mechanics (gear systems, realistic turning, etc) would probably hamper the experience, when the game can be very fast paced and precision heavy at times. At higher levels of play you will use your boost to fly through the air, tilting your car to direct it towards the ball in mid-air. This requires practice and precision, and is very satisfying when executed correctly. This game has a high skill ceiling in that regard, where goals and saves can be pulled off, and the difficulty of them can skyrocket depending on the situation.The multiplayer is good, there are dedicated servers, in fact ONLY dedicated servers, which is something I've never really come to think about. The game modes range from 4v4, 3v3, 2v2 to 1v1. All are different in how they are played, but 3v3 is the mode I play the most and the mode that is considered ""standard"" in the game. In 3v3 you can learn about player rotation on the pitch, defensive roles, attacking roles and backup roles. Look these up on the steam guides if you are curious. The servers are split into casual and ranked games, where casual games do not impact your MMR or ""elo"" but do give you EXP and affect your all-time stats, and ranked games will impact your ranked points and MMR as well as your all-time stats. The ranked system uses points to monitor progress, starting at around 200, and you gain points on victory and lose them when you lose a match. I play this game alone mostly, and an issue I have with casual games were teamstacking in 3v3 games, where I would be matched against 3 players who were all friends, and the games would be fairly one-sided from having to play against a team that most likely communicated their play amongst themsleves. Since switching to ranked games I have not felt the urge to go back, there is even a mode called ""Solo Standard"" which is exclusively for single players looking to play 3v3 without the worries of facing a coordinated team.Teamplay is a large part of rocket league, all modes except 1v1 require coordination to be played well, perhaps with the exception of 4v4 mode appropriately named ""Chaos"" where there are so many cars that strategy and balance dips from having too many cars on the pitch at once. You will have to learn simple things like proper round start etiquitte, player rotation, setting up passes, scoring goals from passes, scoring aerials, outmaneuvering the opponent, and so on. The community is a mixed bag, sometimes you will encounter jerks who spam chat-commands ironically, sometimes you will have a pleasant game full of sportsmanlike players. So not that different from most other communities, I'd say. You can even turn text chat off if you want to.Overall I can say that this game is one of my favourite games of the year, and I will continue to play it... indefinetely? Maybe.

												Buy it, just buy it! Don’t let your dreams be dreams. Yesterday you said tomorrow. So just buy it! Make your dreams come true. Just buy it. Some people dream of scoring goals with rocket propelled cars, while you’re going to wake up and work hard at it. Nothing is impossible… you should get to the point where anyone else would quit and you’re not going to stop there. NO! What are you waiting for?! BUY IT! JUST BUY IT! YES YOU CAN! JUST BUY IT!

												I bloody love this game!!! This is the first game in a long time that has made me smile so widely, scream at the top of my lungs and literally lurch and kick as I play, haha! Intense eye-fixating matches, beautifully crisp gameplay, fantastic replayability, no loading screens (woo!) and just so much more goodness. Most of all, it's all about playing with friends and people! Very happy with this game, it's become a lifestyle over the past few days!

												Soccer with rocket cars?  Yes, please!  This game is finely crafted multiplayer perfection (and the single player modes are great too), with the right touch of chaos to go along with skillful gameplay.  Even when you mess up a great shot or send the ball flying into your own goal, you'll have a lot of fun doing it.  I expect the skill ceiling for this game to be very, very high over time, but it's forgiving enough that even people who feel overwhelmed by other online games can have a lot of fun and contribute to the team. An absolute steal for the price - if you buy it, you'll keep playing, and playing, and playing....(In fact, what am I doing here?  I need to get back in there - FOR GLORY!)

												If you're looking for a great game to play online with others, either casually or competitively, or just to have a good time with some friends, there probably isn't a better choice than Rocket League. - It's fun, fast paced, hectic, hilarious, and both challenging, yet simple, all at the same time. It doesn't matter if you only play games that are on the simple side, or ones that are extremely difficult. It really is the sort of game that just about everyone could have a great time playing, and you don't even have to be good at it, or like sports.  The only real downside to this game, if you do intend to play online, is the terrible nature of the community (like with most online games). It's probably best just to disable both voice and text chat in the options, as almost nobody says anything of value. Even the quick-chat is highly abused and used by players mostly just to taunt and harass others.  It really is a must-buy, though, especially if you're looking for a fun game that actually has an active player base.			",892,201,34,136,64,14,158

												Rocket League is a great example on how to take a simple idea  and make it an incredible game. The game is easy to get into but hard to master. At first glance it may seem that this game is just about who gets to hit the ball , but there is more to it . Ball control and tactics takes time to learn. The one major complaint i have about the game is the poor matchmaking from my experience. Either i play with people who are worse than me or people who are  way better than me , what happened to match people with similiar skillset. And the south east asia servers are♥♥♥♥♥♥in this game.Great fun in short bursts - 8.5/10			",125,9,5,4,8,0,6

												Soccer with Cars!PROS:>A wonderfully made sequel to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars with much better graphics, mechanics, and new content>Psyonix took a very simple idea and made something wonderful with it. Rocket League truly is the easy to learn - hard to master game that the more you play the better you become>Rocket League is constantly watched by its developers who update the game periodically and always deliver new free and DLC content (All DLC for this game is only cosmetic which delivers a much better experience for those who want more and doesn't effect those who don't decide to pick up the DLC)>Rocket League provides a competitive and casual playlist for those who wish to either play for  #1 on the leaderboards or jump into a few matches here and there>Unlike other sports games where you press a button to do an action, in Rocket League you actually have to learn moves and tricks. You control the direction of your car and how you play each and every matchCONS:>At times I find competitive matchmaking to be off to where you get matched with players way below your skill level and sometime players way above your skill level>Although Rocket League provides a fun and awesome experience, you don't get the full experience playing alone. I suggest picking up Rocket League with a couple of friends to make it more interestingFINAL VERDICT:If you do get the chance to pickup Rocket League with a few friends I suggest you do so. For 20 dollars you can't go wrong for the amount of hours you an your friends will pour into Rocket League			",76,10,2,3,11,1,1

Corner♥♥♥♥ing simulator 2015 for sureRocket League reviewI don't really enjoy playing football/racing games (or just any sports game in general), but for some reason when you blend the two together, you get a really fun game! I've honestly been doubtful to get this one, but don't have any regrets buying it - not even after playing it on and off for a good year.After first being introduced to it by watching E3, I told myself to keep this game in mind because I might want to buy it sometime in the (distant) future. A little bit later, checking out some twitch as usual, this game was just everywhere. So I watched some streams and I thoroughly enjoyed them. Much more than I had anticipated. So eventually I decided to just buy this game and give it a go. I have to say it's been long since I bought a game at full price, but it has been totally worth it. What I like+ Gameplay is VERY enjoyable: intense, hilarious, chaotic and rageworthy+ Easy to learn, hard to master+ Tutorial + training areas!+ Matches are short (5 minutes), making it ideal for casual players also+ You don't need friends for this game, however I do recommend playing with them+ AI (computer controlled) cars are pretty decent+ Car customization!+ Game looks gorgeous+ Some nice catchy tunes that totally get you into the mood for some intense Racing/football+ It's best played with a controller, but mouse and keyboard do work fine too+ Price tag is about rightWhat I don't like- Fairly toxic community at times (hence why I recommend to play with friends)- AI cars (not always so decent)ConclusionOverhyped? Maybe, but all in all, a very enjoyable game. Whether you just want a quick 20 min break or a long 3- hour session, it's all up to you. One thing is for sure: you'll have fun. That is, if you don't take the game too seriously.			",260,105,1,45,22,0,16

												This game is so simple yet so fun. I cannot explain it, but it's highly addictive. I mean, driving small cars and playing soccer with the oversized ball? Sounds stupid. But actually it's dynamic, tense and fun, especially in online play. You can unlock cars, decals, tires, painjobs, stuff like that, you can also play training, exibition, seasons and of course multiplayer. I have it on both PC and PS4 and I have to say, it's much easier to play with controller than keyboard. Anyway, yes, I would recommend this because it's pure fun!

Okay, okay. Yes, I still exist. I meant to post this review earlier but I couldn't due to some technical issues.Let me put this out here: I'm not a soccer fan. Probably because I'm an American (despite my name) but I just never got into it. I played it when I was three and quit before our first game, so I was never big on it. But then I was introduced to Rocket League. At first, I didn't care too much for it. Eventually, however, I soon realized I was missing out. When I was on the verge of buying it, my awesome friend Cyroden bought the game for me at the most convenient time. After playing it when I had my opportunities, I'm ready to give an opinion on it.GraphicsThe game is gorgeous. Very gorgeous at that. Compared to other ""sports"" games, this one stands out. Everything is incredibly detailed and is high quality compared to the other potatoes we've gotten in the past few years. Not to mention, this game comes with a replay feature, and with it, if used properly, you can make some incredible screenshots. I don't have any issues with anything here.Gameplay This is the core of the game. If this is bad, then it's not worth buying the game. But I gave this game a thumbs-up, so you know what I'm going to say. Everything is very smooth and flopping around in a car is just flat out awesome. It's a simple concept but it has a learning curve that's quite time consuming to master. I would highly recommend a controller to ease the suffering a little bit, but it's not that necessary. It's still playable with the keyboard and mouse. Getting adjusted to the controls can take a bit of time, because I first mixed jumping and toggling the ball camera up, and it didn't turn out so well. Some of the controls do seem questionable, even after I converted to controller with this game. However, it isn't too rough and you should manage to get the hang of it within a couple of hours. Also, if you're a dude who loves creating stuff (like myself) then praise the devs of this game for adding a car editor here. There's also no pay-to-win techniques or anything here, you can get every single item in the game without spending a dime, and there's no way you can pay for the items anyway. Everything is unlockable, and the editor is simple to use. Would I add some more to it? Yes. But it's so rare to find any kind of simplistic editors these days I'm already thankful there's one in this game.StoryThere's no story, it's just a multiplayer game meant to be fun, this won't be counted towards the final score.AudioThis one is going to be short and sweet as it doesn't really matter all that much in this situation. The music fits and some of the tunes can be catchy, and the audio is pretty solid as well. There are no major flaws, but there's nothing to drool over here.ReplayabilityOf course, this is the debatable one here. I didn't get hopelessly addicted to it, but I still really enjoy this game. My one problem, and it's probably the biggest issue I have with the game, is the fact that it seems heavily reliant on having friends play with you. I had friends to play this game, and when I played with them, it made a significant difference in the fun factor of the game. I would've played a lot more of this if it wasn't for the fact it's not as fun if you're playing alone. But, it does excel in the fact that it's a fun game to play with friends so I'd recommend trying to find some out in the wild.VerdictRocket League is flat out fun. Yes, it's flawed, but it's still an excellent title to play if you've got some friends, a controller (preferably) and a free night where you've got nothing to do. Finally, a game that had a clean PC release and didn't try and drain your money!Graphics - 9.5/10Gameplay - 9.0/10Story - NONEAudio - 7.5/10Replayability - 7.5/10.:8.4/10:.+Beautiful graphics+Smooth, simple gameplay with a solid learning curve+CAR EDITOR!+No cheap pay-to-win techniques+Acceptable audio...-...but it doesn't get any awards-Heavily reliant on having friends-Confusing controls at first			",150,23,0,20,8,2,12

												This is one of those games that grabbed my attention.  I saw it on the front page of Steam and decided to give it a go.  I had some work to do one fair evening but I wanted to do a little game first.  I played one round and was absolutley terrible.  I had to get better!  So I tried again, and again, and again, and again, and again.  Now 4 hours later I haven't got any work done.  Thanks Rocket League.Seriously though, this game is ADDICTING.   The controls are super tight on an Xbox 360 controller.  Every precise movement counts when going for a goal.  Easy game to pick up but has a very high skill ceiling.  Honestly, I can see this becoming an eSport.  It is that competitve.			",459,101,11,36,22,9,44

												I don't care about cars or football so i am surprised at how addictive and fun this is.The good:- Fast, fun and simple gameplay that is very easy to get in to.- Great controls with controller support.- You can make your car wear a viking helmet.- Very nice and detailed graphics. You can see every single individual blade of grass on the field, it's actually pretty ludicrous that it runs at a constant 60fps.- Thousands of people are playing the game so you can jump in to a match in about 20 seconds and it's (mostly) lag free.- Did i mention you can make your car wear a viking helmet? That's a thing.The bad:- Not much. It could do with some more modes but i'm sure there will be many updates considering how popular the game is.			",262,44,3,16,19,5,15

												This is the first game I've ever felt inclined to give a review on. I have to say it's probably one of my favorite multiplayer experiences ever. NO LAG on online multiplayer, great graphics but still very well optimized, and a fun community that simply loves the game. I'm not one to choose these kinds of indie competitive games but the gameplay at least had me wanting to use it as a local multiplayer game (yes, it can have up to 4-way splitscreen). However, after playing one match online I ended up playing for a few hours straight. I highly reccomend this game. Since it is new, the player base is fairly large (about 40,000 in matchmaking from 11pm to 2am) it will surely give you hours upon hours back on your money. 10/10 Will binge play this until my fingers bleed.P.S. I was playing this with a controller so I'm not sure how well the keyboard controls work for this.			",83,11,3,12,18,0,7

												This game is a jewel, the developers were able to mix a simple game with a very competitive background, the fun is guaranteed at short bursts of 5 minutes per gameplay, the more you play, the better you get at it, but it doesn't really matter because the matchmaking system really does it work, and puts you against people that has the same skill as you, being always a fair game (Except if a retard teammate decides to leave for no reason at the start of the game).I find myself playing it daily, it doesn't make you have bad feelings like CS:GO does, for example (800 hours on record, and I'm sick of the game by now), if you were thinking about picking this game up, do it now, you are able to create a party with your friends and play ranked, where you get points via winning, and lose points via losing, in a simple yet smart way of categorizing players, unranked, where nothing really matters, or a private match, to mess around with boths or without bots, as I said before, fun guaranteed. This is my choice as game of the year.Enjoy!PS: When you're looking at the store page, you can't miss the DLCs being there, but don't start thinking about them as a stupid, greedy move made by the developers, the game is cheap, so are the DLCs, they just add cars (Every car is almost the same, they're totally balanced and equal), antennas, wheels, boost ""skins"", and other aesthetic stuff.

												Rocket League is one of my most recommended games for steam users as it is is just a necessity. It is one of those games that must be part of any collection even with it being relatively new still, and has amazing replayability. Even with around 250 hours in game, I still feel experienced enough to say that with a mixture of gameplay styles and techniques to try such as aerials; it makes the game much more fun than it appears at first view. It's not just a demolition derby football game, it has a diverse set of mechanics which makes it differ from any other game and unique in it's own way. It does help to play with friends, but playing by yourself is also just as good. Playing with friends means funny muck ups and great goals are even better as you get to share them with people who are enjoying the game as much as you, and makes for great experiences, but by yourself is just as good sometimes.The concept behind the game is so simple yet can be difficult to master when compared with footage with really good players who harness their car's ability to move in different ways for the advantage, but then that is just more reason to play the game to become better and learn how to score goals in different ways.

												Rocket League is one of the best games of 2015. It's stupidly fun, incredibly polished, and has a ridiculously high skill cap. There is nothing more satisfying than getting an aerial goal from across the field, and even playing defense is fun and involves a lot of mind games. The crossplay with PS4 is spot-on and I've never had to wait more than 20-25 seconds to find a ranked match. Playing well requires a lot of teamwork and coordination so if you have friends who play this game it's even better. An absolute must buy GOTAY 11/10 points for Gryffindor			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												LAUNCH WEEK WARNING: The game servers are having problems at the moment, and when they're down you're stuck to offline play. If you're only buying this for multiplayer, I recommend waiting until the devs sort things out.Vehicular Football/Soccer is not something one usually thinks about, so it's not something one would imagine they need in their life.In a single match of Rocket League, I learned that it's something most people need more of in their lives. I still have much more to experience out of this game, so I may update the review as I go. As it stands, Rocket League is an incredibly fun indie racing-sports game. You are a car/truck, and you play football/soccer by driving into a giant bouncy ball. You have rocket boosters. You have vertical jump boosters. You can wall climb, ceiling crawl, bicycle kick, and sometimes explode.Rocket League is the embodiment of ""Easy to learn, difficult to master"" gameplay. This means it is very accessible, but there's skills you can work on to improve your game. If you play just one match of Rocket League, you'll know how to play all the basics. For the advanced, there's learning better ball control with double-tapping, flying, and so on.Teamwork is absolutely effective. Get this, get your friends to get this, join a party and play as a team. Just like actual football/soccer! With flying, exploding, spinning, rocket cars.I'm still working through the game's content. There's offline exhibition games, a Season mode, online play, and tutorials. I'm hoping for some really intense online bracket tournaments involving multiple teams, but so far I've only played regular online matches. There's also local split-screen play, and cross-play with PS4 players! As of right now, I feel like most players are PS4 online, because no one seems to use the chat at all.I have one small gripe, but it may just tie in to the server troubles mentioned above: the matchmaking could be better. The matchmaking system is competent when it first sets a game up, but if a player drops, it doesn't seem to try to bring new players in. If a whole team leaves after a match, sometimes it will hang on the matchmaking for so long, it's faster for your team to just quit that match and create a whole new match, with new matchmaking that works. But bear this workaround in mind, and you can avoid those waiting periods.Update Edit: Although there's no traditional dedicated server listings, you can setup Private Matches with just your buddies or what not. Retracted that comment from matchmaking gripes.Just pure, nonsensical, sporting good times to be had here. A must have unless you despise racing, or sports, but honestly, you might even find yourself having a good time then too.To think that I spent 2 years hyping over Batman: Arkham Knight, and that whole ♥♥♥♥♥torm goes down, and I have more fun with Rocket League in fifteen minutes than I probably ever will with that game. And for only $20.			",271,59,4,41,52,1,56

												I can't even begin to give this game enough praise. Why?I start playing this game with the intent to only play an hour, and realize many hours later how long I've actually been playing. Whether I'm experiencing a bitter defeat, a glorious victory, or a five minute overtime bout I'm still having a blast. I yell, I shout, I pump my fist in hoorah for that aerial save I just made. And I still can't get enough of this game.Rocket League is a very well polished sportsy footballesque game where you drive cars and try to shoot the ball into the opposing teams goal. It's a simple concept but with all the moves and tricks your cars can perform there is suprising depth in how to play as an indvidual and as a team. You can perform all types of moves, you can do just about any type of roll or flip perceivable, single jumps, double jumps, and you can even fly with your boost. This is one of the few games that I've had this level of drive to master my play, and with two whole days of game time logged away I feel like I've really just mastered the basics and am just now scratching the surface on higher level play.I'm often a bit hestitant to jump into online games, especially ranked. I find ranked matches in general to be stressful and a little too adrenaline intensive, yet in Rocket League I've had nothing but a blast playing competitively even when I was as green as the turf I was driving on. I've never even hesitated to try new things in competitive games or to try and master aerial shots and other such techniques that are easy to screw up. In short, I've had a lot of fun playing this game and the drive to better my play has been a contributing factor to my enjoyment. Playing with a friend makes the game all the more enjoyable, being able to shout at each other over VOIP about each amazing shot we convert or each epic save we make makes an already exciting game all the more awesome.Bottom line. This game is FUN. It's just fun. You jump in, you find a match, you play, and you have fun. It's not overly complex, it doesn't add lots of un-needed features. It's straight up action packed fun.P.S. And of course, like any good driving game, you can customize your ride so you can kick butt in style.			",632,233,12,101,54,6,131

Rocket League is a damn good game. It's fun, very addicting and the gameplay can be quite humorous at times. Just playing this game for a few minutes is relaxing and laid back. If you want to play it competitively you can, and if you don't, you can play it casually just as well. This game made Soccer, a sport that I personally didn't care that much for, fun for me. Rocket League, simply put, is a very entertaining game that will give you hours of constant enjoyment. Suffice it to say, I think this game is well worth your money and I, for one, am glad to have played it.8.5/10: ""A very fun game that will leave you highly entertained and wanting for more after every single match.""

												Rocket League is a game that is best played with a group of friends. There is just something about a team gelling so well that you can dominate another with relative ease. Although competitive, it is a fantastic game to just sit back and relax with. This is especially true when using a controller.The customisation options for the vehicles in this game are plentiful and really allow the player to stand out. Although, a small minor update to allow the painting of the wheels would be nice...A vast selection of options for private matches are available to change, meaning you can create some rather interesting matches at times.Overall, the game is great and can easily be played by almost anyone with 5 minutes of free time.

												Rocket-controlled autos flipping through the air in Thunderdome-esque matches of fenced in range soccer sounds like the indiscernible ramblings of a psycho, yet it winds up being sufficiently insane to work. Psyonix's Rocket League, the follow up to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, finds imbecilic fun in pulling turbocharge-fronted flips in a baked good truck, and the white-knuckle framework in working with your social occasion to control the mammoth ball on offense and resistance. The smart and liquid ludicrousness of Rocket League wires into an authentic respectable time – paying little personality to servers that now and again work perfectly. The crucial mode puts two social events of three in obviously differing however execution unclear vehicles (however 1v1, 2v2, and 4v4 assortments exist) as they race here and there the pitch looking for after the class' greater than typical likeness a soccer ball. The goliath thing is, you don't have to know anything about driving diversions or soccer to play. The models are basic: drive really energetic around glorious, flickering, neon shaded fields and do bolster traps while trying to crush a never-endingly ricocheting ball into a misleadingly tight space. The heart of Rocket League lives in that thought unfathomable change. It's thanks in wide part to the utilization of what I would call ""material science in any case,"" where the laws of gravity and essentialness get a splendid climb to think about driving on the dividers and housetop, and unconventional mid-air heading changes that would condense the driver in this present reality. By the by, its astounding change is so arcadey and fulfilling that I reliably need to remind myself to pump the brakes or lay off the traps when an immediate push or pound will do. Furthermore, those traps are the principle surface-scratching look at Rocket League's layer of philosophy under the unmistakably tumultuous squashing of metal. Tapping your ricochet get places you unmistakable all around, where tapping it again with a course held plays out a somersault, barrel roll, or bike kick. It may sound clear – and truly, it is – yet timing a hit to interface with a speeding ball, and controlling the course you send it cruising, down to right edges, takes some expertise. There are genuine, uncommon levels of fulfillment to be tapped when you see an accessory sorting out a shot from the corner and read the condition, pummeling on the brakes to push the ""go"" into the objective with an impeccably masterminded barrel roll. It's electric. Outside of the enraged and inebriating gameplay, Rocket League has deficient couple of parts to substance out the experience. The player-advancement structure – where winning matches, performing in-redirection deeds, or doing anything truly, wins you encounter – opens to some degree stable of insane vehicles or therapeutic decals and embellishments. It's engaging to drive a truck wearing a sombrero, without question, however since there's in every way that really matters zero mechanical refinement between the dozen or so sportsters, trucks, exotics, a couple thought models and no shy of what one hardened yogurt truck (select to PS4 players), there's no certified estimation improvement that developments how you play a match. Recollecting that is all superbly sensible for a level multiplayer playing field, I would have expected to see every auto go on the qualities and insufficiencies determined by their certifiable accessories: wear autos as snappy however difficult to-handle strikers, trucks and vans as slower yet more grounded guardians, and the adjusted yet all around advantageous roamers some place in the inside. It appears like a missed chance to incorporate a more basic association with your cars in the parking spot, particularly when making a squad to play through a whole season. By the by, there is an other advancement twist found in comprehending how to utilize the shocking mechanical noteworthiness of Rocket League's different controls and whimsical material science. Whether that twist takes you through online focused or arranged matches, lovely showcases, up to four-player neighborhood obliging play on split-screen, or each of the 36 weeks of a completely widened season mode, the Rocket League experience is constantly about getting into the going with throttle-pumping match. Recalling there are leaderboards to track your bits of learning and general limit, Rocket League servers battle to bolster the converging of PlayStation 4 and PC players seeking after for same and cross-arrange matchmaking sessions, rendering the lion's share of Rocket League's online segments – including the online party structure – spotty, most perfect circumstance. Luckily, the AI is critical on either burden setting above Rookie, both as partners and adversaries, so Rocket League doesn't lose much in a totally separated proximity, which is uncommon, since its online suite is, in a manner of speaking, unsteady. Rocket League is a phenomenal circumstance where the execution of a key, over the top accepted is so solid along these lines beguiling that it needn't issue with a monstrous measure of additional parts around it. The surge of tearing over the pitch at full turbo to deny a shot on focus with a hold bike kick is sufficient to bring me back on different occasions for only ""one more match,"" even without basic improvement frameworks. Rocket League is a phenomenal, silly, simple to learn and hard to star development sports redirection which requests that you get a few sidekicks and play a few rounds.(All reviews are captured from the Internet and hustled through a royal ine of synonym tools three times both for laughing and to store time. In my religion, this is known as Art(TM), but you can call it ""Threewording"")			",324,44,31,27,29,2,48

			A late gift to our fans, hope all our followers had a great holiday season! Poem by: Josh and Valente		

As an American, the only way a game of footy is entertaining to me is if it's played a few middle aged fat blokes in Toyota Yarises. Thankfully, there is someone out there who is a whiz programmer that  has put together a game that entertains people like me and I am sure a few ""football"" fans as well. Rocket League is built upon simple mechanics that are easy to pick up but difficult to master. Jumps, boosts and wallrides can be strung together into insane acrobatics that foist the ball into the net. You can customize the aesthetics of your ride by putting in time and unlocking goodies and competative online play make this a title you will come back to over and over. It's insane to think it has taken so long for a satifying vehicle based soccer game to pop up here on steam.			",1843,697,76,250,218,18,319

												I've been playing this game non-stop since I found it on Twitch. It's a game that's easy to learn but hard to master. You will find countless funny plays but if you want to take the game to the next level you will see it's very skill based. I still play this game every day and for me it's very addicting. If you're wondering whether you want to buy it or not, check out some videos of noobs and pro's to see the difference for yourself. But don't forget, your own experience is always the best.

												Rocket League is one of the best games I tried this year.I would definitely tell my friends to buy it so we can have fun together!For those of you who loves soccer and want an awesome version of it, this game is perfect :)Also, I really like the gameplay. You are not limited to just hit the ball. You can use the car however you want.The boost let you fly in the air and make amazing goals.			",71,4,3,8,8,1,11

												I don't usually buy games at full price (especially not at $20), but decided to give this a try.  Long story short, it has been worth every penny, and is one of the most addictive games I have played in years.  Pros - Perfect for study breaks since each match is only about 5 minutes.  Read one chapter of your textbook... reward yourself with a match. - Simple and easy to play, but challenging to master.  Figuring out how to hit the ball (especially in the air) is difficult at first, and there is a learning curve. - Great developers who have already announced free DLCs (along with extra paid cosmetic DLCs). - Optimized even for low-spec PCs. - Cross-platform with PS4.Cons - There used to be a problem with people quitting midway through a ranked game with no penalty.  However, now there is a 15 minute ban from matchmaking for leaving ranked games, so it is not as much an issue now. - Difficult to play without a controller, but still possible.  I would recommend a controller if you buy this. - Occasional lag on servers (but hopefully will be resolved in the future).Overall, I would highly recommend this game.  10/10			",67,13,5,8,16,1,6

												I'm not really a huge fan of driving games. I'm not really a huge fan of sports games.But this........ this rules.Rocket League is one of the most addictively fun games I have ever played. The graphical presentation and flow of the animations is sharp, fluid and perfect, just like the control and response (regardless of whether you prefer keyboard/mouse or controller).The soundtrack selection is wonderful.The insane amount of unlockable content, combined with some really reasonably priced DLC adds to its replayability and sense of progression. Playing a new vehicle is like installing a brand new game.This game really puts you in a competitive state of mind. It's a type of intense that keeps you wanting to come back. Scoring asinine goals and making big saves and assists in Rocket League is one of the most satisfying experiences I've ever had the pleasure of having in a video game.Don't pass it up. It'll be your loss.			",400,111,9,47,29,4,32

												Just one more game...Nope, just one more...Ok, I promise this is the last one!*10 games later*Bruh...This game is extremely fun and addicting.Great, responsive and fluid controls,Beautiful art style and visuals,Great sound design,Great and somewhat in depth customization to give your car a bit of flavour,No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t microtransactions. Yep, that's right, you actually have to earn everything in this game (crazy right?)Oh, and not to mention hours upon hours of fun.Although, if you (like me) play for a long time, it starts to become extrememly repetitive, but what game isn't?I highly recommend this game, it is most definately worth your money and your time.

												Right of the bat you should know EA has nothing to do with this game, so there is only one outcome: a fantastic game.Psyonix is one of those team of developers that implement what ""we"" want to see in their game , and I absolutely love it.Rocket league may seem easy to play but its very hard to master and the skill cap is almost nowhere to be found, after as of 300 hours I am still learning things!Simple, addictive, fun, casual games, ranked games, fun (mutator settings) games, local co-op, split screen, you name it, RL has it, and the good part, new things kepp coming!The DLCs are high quality and at a very reasonable price and you dont even have to buy them, its just aestethics and maybe a new car here and there. watttttI hope I made this game some justice with this review, so follow my advice and give it a Nice shot!10/10			",303,33,13,39,38,2,32

												A fast paced riveting racing game mixed in with a good measure of soccer . What more could you want? You're able to customize your vehicles freely as all of the items are cosmetic. Pull off combos, and coordinate with your friends to shoot that satisfying goal. The game has a indepth tutorial to get you started off on your all-star career, and the game even offers a season mode which will rank you against other players. The game runs well, and looks as it should. If you're thinking of picking up this game with friends, do it. You will truly love it.			",167,30,3,26,8,0,12

In general, it's a very very great game.The goods : - Many differents items and cars- The gameplay is awesome- The maps are awesome- Awesome textures aswell- 19,99$ isn't that much for a game like this- I saw an incoming DLC for FREE +rep- The crowd is like the same when you watch SoccerThe bads :- The ping on some servers are♥♥♥♥♥♥sometimes (happen in several games)- Some people think they're good on ranked but they just need MORE practice and some players can be toxic too (it happens in every community)My rating for this game is a 8/10			",117,21,3,11,17,3,6

												Got the game for a solid 20 euro and it is worth the money.Plus points:+Great depth in the game, easy to pick up but hard to master+Good user interface and options+Fantastic music and soundtracks+Controller support and split screen support+Debugged game and almost no bugs left+Good performance and also enough options to adjust and scale+Content updates to add more content+Easy to create steam parties and invite your friendsMinus points:-Did not like when they introduced the crate system, atleast let players pick what item they want and not the pull the slot machine and pray on getting some you dont have yet.-Price reduction on the crate keys, €0,25 would be more interesting and logical from a business point of view (customers would also buy it more if it was cheap)-At the moment you cannot try any DLC cars before buying it, let there be a few test drives so users can try before buying it.-No DLC bundles, make some bigger packs so you can buy DLC in larger and cheaper packs.

												Absolutely amazing game. I really didn't expect this much fun when I first got it, but holy damn. I've never had this much instant fun in a game in a loooong time. I also don't think I've had this much adrenaline while playing a game ever. Absolutely amazing game design. Its extremely juicy; there are great effects and small touches that really, really add to the fun of the game. Everything you do feels satisfying and extremely responsive. Controls are very intuitive as well if you use a controller, such as Xbox or PS.So deceptively simple, yet so insanely fun. Not much depth on the outside, but once you play you realize that there is a lot of depth, and a LOT of potential.Easy to play, hard to master.Buy this game. Now.			",62,6,2,10,11,2,13

												Rocket league is a nice game to play, even if you're not into racing and/or soccer.I'm personally not into soccer and racing either but this game amazes me because it's a lot of fun.Things I will be talking about in this reviewMatchmakingController supportGraphics/soundsTotal score of the gameMatchmakingYou get opposed to people around the same skill-level as you when you play ranked.The matchmaking in Rocket League is good, compared to some other games out there.Although the matchmaking is good, they might want to work on their AI a bit, because the AI is pretty much god-like.Matchmaking8/10Controller supportThe game supports and recommends the use of a controller because it makes the game more enjoyable, as of now I haven't seen anyone but 1 of my friends play without a controller, and according to him its hard.The overall controller support is good, but because most people out there don't have a controller (except nearly everyone playing Rocket League) I will give this a lower score. Controller support7/10GraphicsRocket League visually looks amazing, really. Futuristic style perfectly underlines the speed and agility of the gameplay, Unreal Engine is ideal for playing with such style. Machines, which you can customize a little, they look great. Stadiums look impressive and epic. The people in the stands feel like they're living, it also has a great merit of the sound component. The crowd was responsive to everything that happens in the stadium: close to the enemy goal post? The crowd was jubilant. You fought off the ball that is about to get to the gate? The crowd will be surprised and will scream so you know you've done good. All the sound effects are high quality, and made perfectly.Graphics9/10Overall score of the game**Please note that all the subjects are counted at the same weight!

												Rocket League - a dynamic racing game in the style of football, developed and published by Psyonix for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows. The game is on 7 July 2015. This game is a sequel to the game in 2008 Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket engine Battle-Cars (SARPBC). Game gameplay is similar to the game SARPBC and includes single and multiplayer (support split screen) mode, has the opportunity to play on a local network, cross-platform Includes game and PS4 between Microsoft Windows. Pros: 1. Gameplay.The game has a couple of modes: 1 vs. 1, 2 vs. 2, 3 vs. 3, 4 vs. 4, 3 vs. 3 Hockey and new clothes often go to various other modes and maps.Where online game without matchmaking? 1 vs. 1, 2 vs. 2, 3 vs. 3, 4 vs. 4 - for all these modes, you can get the title (rank). In each mode, its title, that is, you can sit down for a long time in one mode, in addition to it you will find more then 3. However, I highly recommend that you do not play in matchmaking, because after him, you can spoil your mood.And yes, even in the game there are different machines and tuning them. It is very cool!2. Team play.The multiplayer game is fully revealed potential game ideas. The most interesting part of this. Under the bot can already be arranged, but not real players. They may be misleading, to negotiate, to use clever tactics.3. Graphics.The graphics for the game in 6.5 $ just excellent.4. Soundtracks.They are perfectly matched and fit perfectly into the gameplay.5. The idea of ​​the game.Indeed, this is quite an interesting idea for a game. As I wrote above, this game is like a game gempleem Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle-Cars (SARPBC), but for some reason no one remembers the game as well?Developers Psyonix have reviewed all the disadvantages SARPBC games and made a bomb Minuses: 1.Random.What did I say?For example, you can win the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to the forty-seventh chromosome, which can not use the elementary flight, and just waiting for rebounds, banal transmission through the entire field. And, of course, it is unpleasant. Conclusion: Despite all these drawbacks, the game I loved madly.I thought a long time, take it or not this game, because I do not like football, but in the end he took and never regretted. Excellent arcade game, which will delay than a dozen hours. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

What's in a Name?Naming sequels should be a straight forward process shouldn't it?You can use the same name of the original and just slap a number on the end (or if you're going for ""Artsy"" a roman numeral for extra gravitas).Sometimes people try to overcomplicate things unnecessarily which annoys me.I can get on board with the whole, Alien, Aliens, Alien3 thing,I've even made my peace with the Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10 fiasco(Did they make a Windows 9? and was it so bad they had to lock it in the attic to hide it from the neighbours and feed it fish heads in a bucket when no one's looking?)Anyway some naming systems for sequels defy logic, SimCity, SimCity 2000, SimCity 3000, SimCity 4 then back to SimCity again... that's just crazy!It's either SimCity 5 or SimCity 5000.Have a little consistency people!(not that is really matters, SimCity 5 was crappy anyway).What's in a Name II ?But there are exceptions where I can forgive a sequel for not carrying the burden of its ancestors name.For instance, do you remember a game called ""Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars?""Me neither and as such I'd be unlikely to show much interest in a title called ""Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars 2""(Even typing a title as long of that makes me sad).However a game I have been playing recently (and thoroughly enjoying) has been the snappily titled ""Rocket League"" which the Steam store page confidently tells me is the sequel to the previously mentioned (and ridiculously named) battle-cars game.So as I said, had Rocket League been released as ""Blah, Blah, Blah-Blah Blah-Cars 2"" I'm convinced I would have avoided the title and missed out on a gem!But thankfully it wasn't and I didn't so here we are now!What's in a Name III ?Rocket League is a deceptively simple arcade, car racing and football (or soccer to our American friends) mash-up.As a side note, I've never understood why American Football is called ""Football"", they play the ball with their hands right? so is it called football because handball was already taken?Also, because the label ""football"" is (rightly or wrongly) used for a game played with your hands it results in a sport which is actually played with foot and ball being called ""soccer"".... it's not important but it does boggle my little mind.Anyway... back to Rocket League.Simple SoccerThe Football part of the mash up is a simplified version of ""the beautiful game"".Each match takes place in a caged stadium so there's no need to worry about the ball going out of play, there are no corners or throw-ins, no fouls or offside rules, it's ""soccer"" boiled down to its purest form.As you'd expect, there's a goal at each end of the pitch and one giant♥♥♥♥♥ball (it's bigger than the cars!) that you need to knock around the field.Each match only lasts for 5 minutes but with most of the interruptions that slow down a regular footy match removed it makes for a frantic, adrenaline fuelled 5 minutes of non-stop action.There are different stadiums to choose from too, you can even pick up more by way of DLC to keep the background looking fresh if you feel the need.The Drive to WinThe driving side of the mash-up is where Rocket League really shines.Gone are the egoistical, under-educated but overpaid human players that ""show-boat"" around the pitch during a ""real"" football match, here we have cars, gorgeous, acrobatic  rocket powered cars!Winning games will unlock a whole wealth of upgrades and adornments for your vehicle too.There are hats, flags, wheels, decals, you can even change the colour of the smoke that spews out the back when you fire up your rockets and hurtle across the arena.These  customisation options are a huge amount of fun and give your chosen vehicle an element of individuality when you're playing (and if you're as talentless as myself, losing) against your peers online.Maybe those go faster stripes really will make a difference in the next match...   (I need all the help I can get!)Ball ControlAs a football simulation Rocket League is a great driving game.The handling of the various vehicles is surprisingly good and complimented by a very intuitive set of controls.You'll need to dust off your game pad to get the most out of Rocket League, but it's totally worth it!It's rare that I play a game where the controls feel so dialled in and natural.It doesn't take long before you're hitting the controls without thought to make the car jump, flip and spin on command, of course doing this in the right location to make the ball go where you want is another matter.""Easy to learn, hard to master"" are six words that definitely apply to Rocket League.Tyre-BallThe game itself is fantastic to play,  you can choose between intimate 1v1 matches all the way up to the mayhem you'll experience in a chaotic 5v5 match.With a little (or maybe a lot) of practice you'll find yourself sliding and skidding your vehicle into position to intercept, pass and shoot the ball.It's a great feeling when you manage to pull off an impressive move (whether accidental or not) and leaping your car into the air to nudge a high flying ball into your opponents goal is soooo satisfying, especially in an online match when you've got a real audience to admire you car-ball prowess.There's a tutorial and single player mode too which are both vital if you want to learn the ropes before you take your newly fledged ""tyre-ball"" talents online.If I could give you some advice to avoid annoying others and embarrassing yourself when you first fire up Rocket League it would be this:""Practice before you start playing online!""(Hey, that's six words again, spooky!)Hear Me Roar!So we know the game plays well, but what are the aesthetics like?Well, the arenas are all beautiful and provide a pretty backdrop which you'll probably hardly notice as you zoom around the pitch.The vehicles themselves are bright and varied with some neat customisation options (although I'm sad to say that ""go-faster stripes"" did not make me a better player).The sound is of a high standard too, from the roar of the engines to the roar of the crowd, the atmosphere created by the audio gives the game an energy and intensity which heightens the whole experience.Rocket League looks and sounds great!(yes, I'm doing the six words thing on purpose now.)What's in a name IV ? But can I sum rocket league up in six words?hmmm...Well there are cars battling to win the ball, let's call them battle-cars, they're rocket powered, maybe even supersonic and they are definitely acrobatic....Maybe something like""Supersonic Rocket Powered Acrobatic Battle Cars...""although that does sound familiar...It'd be a great name for a game though...Wouldn't it?Final WhistleWhatever you want to call it, Rocket League is a polished, intuitive and extremely addictive alternative sports title.I'm having a blast with it!But remember, if you do come and join the fun (and you should) and if you encounter a player online with an unprecedented lack of skill (and go-faster stripes), take it easy on them...It might be me!For the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/ ",743,414,35,113,211,8,165

												I´ve played a lot of games over the years, from MMO´s to indies to god knows what.However never have a first impression of a game been this good. I sat down with 2 friends and played this game for the first time with a xbox controller and within 5-10 mins i had the best laugh i´ve had for a long time.The game is easy to pickup and easy to learn but diffenetly something you should play with friends, the sheer joy of in fact lining up that perfect goal or getting it is a great feeling of something silly and stupid that will make you scream the ears of all your friends and wake up whoever else lives in the house.This game is a perfect balance between silly, stupid and genius really, the music, the gameplay and the easy way of learning makes it sooo addictive that it is really just a must have for anyone who likes to have a great laugh with friends and just wanna forget everything else for a few hours.I´m for sure gonna play this even more over the next long time as my car needs some swag ^_^ ",3006,1169,124,357,451,35,532

												An incredible game created by incredible developers that care for quality and their fans. Psyonix have put so much effort into creating this car football sequel and have delivered exactly what fans from the community have asked for. (And more!)The visuals are colourful, over the top and impressive.Physics and gameplay are perfect and the game plays just how it should.Loads of customisation items. Literally millions of different combinations.The online is very very stable.Various ways to play with friends including up to 4 player split screen.Cross play for PC and PS4.A season mode for offline play.Replay editor which also acts as a photo mode is a very welcome feature.Future support for the game confirmed, including DLC and free stadiums.Day one release on PlayStation Plus for free is a wonderful bonus and a very loyal move from Psyonix to their fans.This game is tons of fun and is the most fun I've had with a game in ages. You won't regret picking this up. Although you may never put it down.			",52,8,2,4,8,2,1

												If you and some friends are looking for something fun and light-weight to mess around with this summer while waiting for fall releases, Rocket League should prove a worthy candidate. Playing with random strangers or with AI provides a significantly less enjoyable experience as it is the camaraderie and “oh man, did you see that!” moments that elevate the game above its simple premise. The promise of free content updates and the highly active community are further incentives to join the fun, though the staying power of the game is something that will be revealed only with time.Read Full Review [www.newgamenetwork.com] ",172,23,5,11,6,0,21

												Simple competitive fun with lots more. I've become old and boring and haven't truly enjoyed playing games with strangers for nearly a decade. I just don't like being on other people's time and sitting in lobbies. I'd rather play singleplayer these days. But Rocket League brought me back into the fold. You're rarely waiting on other people. You can drop in to most modes within seconds and games are merely five minutes of clock time and pauses for goals. Its simple, quick, doesn't waste your time. I enjoy that. Not to mention the game itself is fun fun fun! And there is a subpar singleplayer even. I was indoctrinated with the standard ""soccer"" modes of 3v3 but as I plateau'd and didn't develop into a competitive player I branched out into the less popular modes and matchups. There's plenty here to keep people of all skill levels, shapes, and sizes happy. E-Sports level competitiveness with the ability to join with your friends right down to what I'm doing casually bouncing into 2 or 3 ""Rumble"" matches with strangers when I got the time. Rocket League did something else for me too. The PC has a barren desert in the sports genre and this mildly and subtly fills the void a little more.They're also consistently adding new free content and updates. All the while keeping paid DLC cosmetic. I could care less about all the knick-knacks as I don't even decorate my car but its got all that item customization people like. Wheels, paints, decals, toppers(hats), etc. They even added a crate system for those so inclined. Full price might be a little steep now that they do indeed have all these other avenues of revenue but that's what sales are for and I'd recommend waiting for one. Recommended!

 Rocket League: a synonym to the word ""awesomeness"" I have played many soccer games like PES & Fifa for many years now and i absolutely loved them! and i have played many racing games in the past years but sadly i absolutely hated each one of them! so when i first heard about this game i got confused; how could they mix two things that are totally different (at least for me), and how well could it be? in the end i used my money to buy something else thinking that i'm not gonna like it anyways .. Luckily, they made this free weekend and i finally had the chance to try it out after a long period of waiting and to be honest i got totally amazed! i don't know how to describe the feeling but this game is just great. i didn't had the chance to play it for long because i wasted most of my weekend downloading it but here are some positive things about it: (i couldn't find anything bad about it anyways)+ brilliant idea for a game+ It's so easy to learn + solid game-play and smooth controlling+ Beautiful graphics, and it doesn't require a PC gamer to run+ there is no fancy upgrades or items that gives you extra abilities+ all the cars have the same speed and abilities, it's all about you and your skills+ you can make your car look like whatever you want! customize it using your own style+ full of players, this game is so alive+ no bugs, no crashed+ played for 6 hours strait, didn't see a single cheater, and everyone was so nice with me, it's so rare to find such a friendly gaming community nowadays so this is a big up for the game+ infinity hours of fun I'm really glad i tried this gem, i want to give a big thank you to the developers for giving us such a generous chance to try it outi enjoyed every single moment of the 6 hours i played but unfortunately i don't have enough money at the moments so i guess i'll miss this sale .. for now this game is in the top of my wishlisted games and i'll try hard to get it as soon as possible i can for the rest of you out there, i wonder why are you guys still here reading this review? just go buy it now! it's a must have one. 10/10Edit: as you already know i bought this game and spent more 45 hours playing it, it's absolutely amazing! i'll update this review as soon as i feel i'm ready, stay tuned! :P			",797,228,23,95,72,15,97

												The great thing about the beautiful game is that it's a very basic concept: Get the ball into the goal. Video games have put various spins on that concept with great results, and Rocket League joins that list.You drive a car straight out of Speed Racer. It's got jump jacks and jet engines that you can actually use to fly for a brief period. It drives great. You can even drive along the wall. Drifting is as simple as holding down a button. Easy to use camera controls and UI elements make sure that you know where the ball is. The presentation is amazing and can get you hyped very easily. The game itself is simple to learn but with the boost system there are some very advanced techniques to figure out. Multiplayer supports 4-player splitscreen as well as 8-player online, even both at the same time. And if you're playing by your lonesome, the AI players can keep you company. Did I forget to mention this game also has crossplay with the PS4 version?Rocket League is excellent and I would highly recommend it to anyone who's enjoyed arcade-style sports games like NBA Jam or NHL 3-on-3 Arcade.

Too bad I did, I have no idea what's going on half of the time and I love it. Rocket League lets you score goals so cool on accident you tell all your friends it was on purpose.

												I am a straight mess after playing this game. My throat hurts. My head hurts. I have been sweating non stop for the last 8 hours of gameplay. I will probably get noise complaints from my neighbors, and now I am completely exhausted. If that doesn't say ""good game"" then damn dude. The gameplay feels like if you made a football (soccer for you that care) game with the Trials (Evolution/Fusion) physics in mind. Tricky, akward, but once you get the feel for it fun as all get out. After figuring out the controlls I started finding my place in the team tactics. All the little unlockables are really fun too. I was running around in a pink buggy with a purple wizards hat, star decals on the side, a Saturn antenni bobble, and confetti coming out of my exhaust. I personally want rainbow sparkle exhaust, but I haven't unlocked that one yet. This game will gave you tourette syndrome. At least it did to me.			",391,64,5,90,15,5,69

												The idea is simple. soccer with rc cars that can propell themselves with rockets as boost. Why is it simple ideas with small twists work so flawlessy.The only negative things about this game are:- number of arenas is small and same(Would love to see one in the shape of a U/S/N with goals on each end point- no custom elements for modes other than ranked and number of people (time, score limit, how much boost the pads give, even options on how the ball acts would be nice, etc) - get or have a game pad (good luck if you dont)- prepare to have no lifePositives- a lot of customization for a $20 game- purely skill based (nothing in game can give you an edge (other than keyboard/mouse vs gampad)- With pc and ps4 gamers togeather its a very big player pool for such a small game- Rocket trails - can pick up and play or go for hours on end- Looks realy good and the style of the game realy fits togeather - NOT FTP and NOT riddled with microtransactions (part of the reason why the game is as good as it is)Ill put is this way, If you even like the idea of soccer and playing the game as cars this is for you and their is much fun to be had  I love this game and its concept/execution			",223,23,16,16,8,0,12

Game is insanely fun, there is a wide range of customisations that does not have an effect on the car (no advantages wohoo! +1 on that)- Server occasionally disconnects me.This game is great to play on when you're ?#@*&%! at another game, great game to chill out on.Awesome game, must buy			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To be honest,I can't accepted tencent.With Tencent agent for this game,our choice was deprived at the same time.Since then,we have no choice but to choose garbage services provided by tencent.However,I can keep happy playing the game, also can buy DLC, can be happy to share with friends to play the game. It has no effect on me playing the game.But,why I choose to not recommended?It's is normal that Psyonix impowered interests game authorized agent.But impowered to a Industry cancer, I can't choose silence!For exampIe,I recommend this game to friends, but my friends can't play with me(at the same stage), what’s more, he(or she) have to endure in purchase disgusting service, etcThey camefirst for the Communists,and I didn't speak upbecause I wasn't a Communist.Then they came for the Jews,and I didn't speak upbecause I wasn't a Jew.Then they came for the trade unionists,and I didn't speak upbecause I wasn't a trade unionist.Then they came for the Catholics,and I didn't speak upbecause I was a Protestant.Then they came for me,but by that timeno one was left to speak up.Isn't this the same reason, please!!!!!!That's all.

												Cars were always meant to play soccer/football.  It's just the way the world was meant to be.  This game fills that giant circular hole in your heart.  It's a ton of fun, the AI was well made and actually gives you a decent fight at higher levels, and the awesome trick shots you can attempt (and in my case mostly miss) are fun all day long.

												Rocket League is a game by the studio that made the free-to-play game Nosgoth that punches far above its weight. It is easy to learn, with a pair of tutorials that can be completed in under ten minutes and is almost immediately fun. However, the addiction starts to set in when you push yourself to start mastering the game.Your first few matches will feel chaotic and hinging entirely on chance. As you acclimate to the controls and physics, you become more confident within the game world and find yourself capable of intentionally performing maneuvers. That becomes a turning point in the game and as you perfect these skills, there comes an incredible elation when you line a shot up -- probably with an assist from another driver -- and nail that in. All with determined calculation, rather than random luck.The modes and arenas have minor variants, but are consistent. It quickly becomes a game pitting carthletes against each other and nothing else. True tests of skill and reflex. There aren't really even any modifications that impact skill, either. All the adding trappings you unlock are cosmetic. The game has ranked and unranked multiplayer of different team sizes and single player with a season/tournament campaign. That's it. That's all it needs.My only negative experience has been with AI/Bots. They are uncannily talented and whether they're on your team or the opposition, they can ruin the game. When you are the only human on your team, there's no joy in absolutely trouncing the other team, because you know it's because of the unfair advantage the bots provided you. Perhaps this is better in the Ranked league, but in general play, there are a lot of people who just drop out, midgame. I do not know if these are occurring because of network issues in this overwhelmingly popular (and therefore still trying to ramp up server and network capacity) game or if they're just poor sports. Either way, having bots substitute is frustrating -- and they don't seem to do match-making for in-progress games, to substitute slots with real players.Back to the positives though -- and this is a big one. You will almost immediately be in awe at how glitzy and shiny the world looks. The game has a great art style and fantastic presentation. Slick and not quite realistic, but very high quality. And the world is smooth. High framerate with, in my experience, absolutely no hitching or lagging or anything else. The game is smooth as silk.I find this a surprise, because it seems like a game that by all rights should be a bit janky. It should come with caveats and ""for the price point"" justifications. It doesn't, though. It's an excellent experience that feels well-crafted. It sets a framework for itself and stays within it, polishing what it does well rather than expanding endlessly upon it, poorly.If the trailer and live streams make this game seem appealing to you, I'd advice picking it up even at the $20 USD price. As long as the playerbase is still there when there is a big sale, that sale is going to be a no-brainer. If this game is found for $10 USD over the next few months, through the holidays -- it is going to be a downright steal. There is so much fun to be had here. Even more so, if you have a couple friends to build a team with.This is a total gem that I have no reservations about recommending.If you want to see some gameplay starting from the first time the game is launched, the following is a six hour live stream of Rocket League (begins about 5m into the video):

Posted: August 29, 2015
 TL;DR in the end of the review!I never had this much fun slamming balls into a big goal in front of me... this is Pu$$...Oh wait... wrong review...Erhm, rhm... Rocket League. Okay, what to say about it? Well, for one, it's the pure definition of a competitive video game: it's easy to learn and takes a lifetime to master.I need, however to adress one thing that will put MANY people off: and that is the mix of genres it seems to have, and that is its mix of football and driving...However: I have no hesitation in recommending this game at all, including for people that do not like racing, football or both, simply because it doesn't belong to any of such genres and as such, the problems you have with those genres/games, you simply won't have here.:- The slow paced gameplay of football, filled with tactics, rules, free kicks, offsides, penalties, yellow and red cards, etc. etc. is COMPLETELY GONE! You can use ur nitro and completely obliterate the opposite team without any repercussions. The only thing football related here is that there's a ball (which is a bomb) and you need to put it in the opponent's goal (which will trigger the ball to explode).- And the same applies to the racing component: there are no pre-determined paths, no speed limits, no linearity, crashing won't penalize you all that much and the vertical limitations are gone as you can fly, jump, wall jump and basically do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want (which I will mention a bit further below in this review)!To put it in a more adequate analogy... I guess I can call it the Quake of sports games  as it clearly takes ideas from the Arena FPS genre, which is where Psyonix (the devs) got a name with their big hit Unreal Tournament 2004 (alongside Epic and DE). It allows a very engaging mix of football and cars. The devs could make a very plain car football game and that would be it. But they didn't do just that, did they?Well, ♥♥♥♥ NO! You can jump, double jump, dash forward, to the sides or even dash backwards, do bycicle kicks, drive on the walls, jump from those walls and fly across the whole map, boost around and so much else! It will take you dozens of hours to master each technique properly and it helps that there is  ZERO RNG or stat based gameplay in the game!!: the cars all perform the same  except in 2 clear aspects: hitboxes (The big Van-like car has a much shorter but taller hitbox than the Dominus muscle car) and drifts/handbrake use. I am using my XBOX360 controller ( which I recommend, though keyboard is VERY intuitive as well ) with customized controls to my liking, where B is the handbrake. With, for example, the Takumi or the Breakout, you can do 180's MUCH more easily than with the Van-like car (I don't know the name of the Van, because I actually don't use it at all :p).GRAPHICSThe graphics are absolutely excellent! Grass looks quite impressive, the bloom and shaders are stunning and give the game a very well needed sense of ""immersion"" that you are in an actual stadium!The game can run on pretty much any PC (granted, you may need to tweak it a bit on weaker PC's, of course) but when maxed out, it's a joy to both look at and play. There's AN FOV SLIDER!!!!! And many more camera options, graphics options are immense as well and can help you tweak the game to your liking (♥♥♥♥ motion blur).AUDIOAudio consist of 2 big elements: Menu soundtrack and In-Game effects.The soundtrack in this game is absolutely awesome! Easily one of the best I've heard the past decade. It makes you hum and bobble your head around with the cool pop tunes.Sound effects are good, but good only. The car engines sound quite ""meh"", but the ball exploding, the sounds the stadium produce when a goal is scored (which are, btw, all different: Every stadium has it's own sound props, which is a very welcome attention to detail) are all very well done. There are lots of different boost trace skins (which I'll adress later) and each make their own sounds, which is, AGAIN, a very nice and welcome attention to detail.GAMEPLAYBesides all the cool moves I listed above I must say the physics in this game are the best I've seen in, probably, ever! I am not even kidding...The game has the same mode (just score the most goals after 5 mins) but there are 4 playlists: 1v1 Duel, 2v2 Duos, 3v3 Standard and the 4v4 Chaos mode (and I can confirm it's chaotic as f*ck!).While there are no different modes... I can say that every playlist has it's own skill to be met. 1v1 requires a more balanced attack and defensive mindset,  2v2 is pure teamwork, 3v3 is a bit more chaotic  and there is space for a full 100% striker and a full-time 100% goalkeeper as well (even though it's not recommended: everyone needs to have a more mixed role, though a more attacking player and a more defensive player ARE CRUCIAL!) and 4v4 takes skill but I play it (as most probably do as well) just for the fun :DEXTRAS / CONTENT IN GENERALThere is a spectator mode and an offline season mode, the latter is barebones at best and serves no purpose, only to practise against bots and collect some achievements.There are 150 customization items for your cars, if I'm not mistaken. These involve Hats, Antennas, Boost trace skins (like a basic nitrous skin, a flamethrower skin, purple smoke, blue data-streams, rainbows (my favorite :D), etc. etc.), paint jobs, materials for the car (you can have cars made of carbon fiber, gloss, metal, etc., very GRID 2-esque, which I really like), overall:It's nearly impossible to find a player with the exact same car as you.You can save replays of your game to watch them later or brag to your friends about that amazing long shot or impossible save you managed to pull off successfully.There a tutorial system that is VERY HELPFUL to noobs but later grows into ridiculously difficult saves and shots that are there to make you see how well you have mastered the game's mechanics (timing is very crucial in any save/shot you take and most of all... power of antecipation... kinda like the Quake multiplayer... eh... see why I called it the Quake of sports now? Well there you go...). There is a ranked mode and leaderboards. There is also an unbelievable amount of stats, like ""How many goals did you score with this hat?"", ""How many kilometers with this set of wheels?"" or ""How many saves did you do with this paintjob?"", which add alot to a very entertaining package that takes dozens, if not hundreds of hours for you to get bored with.Oh and there's crossplatform play with PS4 players (which from my experience, most tend to suck).TL;DR and CONSAlright, let's re-arrange it all with a basic PROS (+) / CONS (-) system since you lazy ""I hate reading"" ♥♥♥♥s love it so much :)+ Great and enourmous ammounts of customization;+ Takes lots of skill to be good at it;+ Beautifu Graphics;+ Phenomenal Soundtrack+ Formidable Physics+ Huge amounts of replayability+ Crossplatform play with PS4+ Some lucky shots, saves and nail-biting close matches will be some of funniest and most satisfying moments in your gaming life, respectively;+ Formidable sense of growth with every match. You don't gain anything, no guns and none of that♥♥♥♥♥♥ But you gain the most important thing that 95% of today's modern games don't offer: YOU GAIN SKILL! (Shocker, I know, most of you probably haven't heard of this word at all :p)+ Adequate even for non-football and non-racing fans as it has nearly nothing in common with those genres.- Server issues at launch (now fixed)- Barebones and pointless single player season mode (MP season mode would be cool, though)Overall, I recommend this game to literally everyone that enjoys video games.

Update 1The new map ""Aqua Dome"" is incredibly resource-intensive: I usually play RL on fairly low settings without lags or framerate drops, but this map seems to require an enormously better hardware. It is constantly lagging and the framerate drop makes this map unplayable. I do not really see, why it was necessary to implement a map with significantly higher graphic requirements: Basically, I have to leave every other game. Update 2 Same goes for Starbase ARC.Update 3 You might have guessed it already: Same goes for the new Dropshot map. It performs slightly better than Aquadome. ENGLISH: I absolutely enjoyed playing this game, for it has an interesting gameplay (soccer = cool, racing = cool, both combined = awesome). What I particularly dislike and what made it hard to be fun is the community, especially in 'Ranked' mode: Usually you end up with a special someone who enjoys ruining the other player's game and therefore their rank: Constantly crashing his teammate on purpose, scoring own goals, swearing or spamming. While you can report these people, all of them state, that they get reported 10 times/day and they do not have to face any consequences at all. If Psyonix solves this issue, playing will be fun again. If not, I will have to stick to teaming up with a steam friend who is not a total♥♥♥♥♥♥ Offline/AI games are no alternative: The bots seem to be demanding enemies when you start playing, but soon, when you reach a certain skill level, they become rather unchallenging pushovers.DEUTSCH: Mir hat das Spiel immer sehr gefallen, es hat ein wirklich interessantes Gameplay (Fussball = cool, Autos = cool, beides zusammen = wahnsinnig gut).Was ich wirklich hasse und was meiner Meinung nach den Spaß versaut hat, ist die Community, besonders im ""Ranked"" Modus: Normalerweise wird man mit irendeinem Spezialisten gepaart, der es unglaublich toll findet den Anderen das Spiel und damit auch den Rank zu versauen: Dauerhaftes Rammen des Teamkollegen, Eigentore, Beleidigungen und Rumgespamme. Natürlich kann man die Leute inzwischen auch melden, aber nach Aussage dieser Leute, hat das selbst bei täglichen Meldungen keine Auswirkungen. Wenn Psyonix das irgendwie in den Griff bekommt, macht Spielen auch wieder Spaß. Wenn nicht, muss ich mit einem meiner Steamfreunde, die keine Idioten sind, zusammen spielen. Offline-Spiele gegen die KI sind auch keine wirkliche Alternative: Die Bots scheinen am Anfang wirklich hartnäckig zu sein,  sobald man aber den Dreh raus hat, spielt man auch die ""Allstars""-Bots mit 8:0 an die Wand.

												The 10 players you meet in Rocket League :The Defeatist                :    The match begins and boom! Within thirty seconds a goal is scored and your team is down 0-1. That's when one player on your team decides it's all over. The lead is insurmountable, the tide is irreversible, the team is unsalvageable. The Defeatist immediately abandons the match to continue the restless search for a team that won't let them down the way you just did.The Spoiler                  :   You've just made an amazing, epic save. The ball was 90% inside your goal, glowing like a white dwarf and about to explode, but you somehow manage to bop it out just in the nick of time. And there's The Spoiler, the player on the other team just parked there, three feet away, who simply nudges it back in for a goal, utterly erasing your heroics.The Archivist                :   Sometimes you want to watch replays, sometimes you don't. Everyone feels that way except for The Archivist, who never, ever chooses to skip the replays even though they're not even featured in them. Even though everyone else has voted to skip it and get back to playing. C'mon, dude! I accidentally scored on my own goal and don't want to relive it. Press skip! Press skip!The Hitman                   :   While most players focus on the ball, some focus on the other players. The Hitman doesn't just demolish other cars when the opportunity presents itself but makes it a personal mission to ram, batter, and destroy you from the opening seconds to the final klaxon. Not a bad strategy, really. If you're hit by this player more than once you'll probably give up on the ball and spend the match looking for a little payback.The Failed Stuntman          :   We all know the ball spends about half its time rolling up the side of the arena, and those skilled enough can chase it and make plays while vertical. The Failed Stuntman thinks the same thing, but is entirely wrong. They'll constantly chase ball up and down the wall and never once connect. Just wait for it to land, willya? You're not doing any good up there.The Only Player On Your Team :   The ball has been centered and you're in the perfect position to knock it in for a score. But what's this? A teammate flies in backwards, knocking it away from you, off the wall, and back into midfield. It's The Only Player On Your Team, and this driver never, ever stops going for the ball, no matter where it is or who else might be going for it at the same time. As far as this driver is concerned, there's only one player on your team, and it's not you.The Doorman's Ghost          :   Praise be to the players who don't always try to score but hang back and protect your team's net. Occasionally a driver will actually spend the entire game playing goalie, which is great! Except for The Doorman's Ghost, who waits patiently between your uprights until the other team takes a shot on goal. At which point he's suddenly somewhere else.The Benedict Arnold          :   We've all done it, either by an ill-timed boost or an attempted save or just bad luck: we've all scored on our own goal. The proper behavior in this instance is to spend the rest of the match feverishly trying to make up for it, but not so for the Benedict Arnold. After scoring on their team they'll vanish in a puff of shame, too embarrassed to even attempt redemption.The Drunken Angel            :   Aerial skills are both important and rare, and most players won't risk it unless they're lined up perfectly or are desperate for a goal. Except for The Drunken Angel, who rockets into the air the second the ball is off the ground despite never once successfully making a play. In fact, even when the ball isn't in the air, this player is. Some drivers just like to fly.The Holdout                  :   You've just had a fun, amazing, hard-fought match with fantastic plays, epic saves, and stunning goals that came down to a lengthy and memorable overtime. Everyone agrees immediately that another game is absolutely necessary. Except for The Holdout, who refuses to ready up. But why? We shared something beautiful! We'll never find each other again! Please, ready up! Ready up before it's too—the Toxic                    :   The reason we use the word 'toxic' is very intentional.   In our observations and research on player behavior, we find that a single source of negative              behavior can ripple through hundreds or thousands of games. For example, let's say we have a game with     6 players--5 are positive, and 1 is negative. The 1 negative player is racist, rages all game, and  intentionally leaves the game. This experience can negatively influence some of the other 5 positive players in the game. Some of these 6 players will play another game of Rocket League and instead of being positive, they might start the game neutral or negative. Their actions can then influence 6 other players in the game, and toxicity spreads. A single negative action could result in thousands of games with negative incidences--this is why many of our latest experiments focus on shielding players from toxicity (Restricted Chat Mode -- forcing players to make a decision between using limited chat resources for cooperative communication, or still using it for negative purposes and being message capped), or stemming the spread of toxicity (our next experiment).

												First of all, im reviewing the single player ""seasons"" mode, as i have not played multiplayer.I was hesitant at first to buy this game, as an arcade style game for 20 dollars seemed like a bit too much, but i have to say, this game turned out to be much better than i thought.It runs smoothly with little to no lag, and the controls are smooth (Using a wired Xbox 360 Controller) and that is something that a game as chaotic as this one certainly needs.The customization options for your vehicle are very fun to play around with, and you can end up with some pretty crazy looking cars! And you unlock the items just by playing matches, which makes it very easy to get new items.The camera options are very convenient, Allowing you to change the FOV, Height, Angle, and distance of the camera.Now, for the actual game, the seasons mode is very fun and competitive, allowing you to pick from different teamates, and to choose how many cars are on the teams. 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4 are the option. 4v4 is my favourite so far though, as it's rather chaotic.Possibly the best thing about seasons mode is that even by yourself you still get very competitive, and that's something that i dont think many games deliver on.The music is a bit garbled and im not sure whether or not its supposed to play all the time, as it usualy stops within a few secconds.Overall, for a game that was just released, it is very fun and i'd recommend it to everyone, whether they like sports or not. I think this game would be even more entertaining with friends, but i don't have any friends that own this game.			",141,15,0,7,10,0,15

												Tencent is an infamous game company known for its malicious competition such as direct plagiarism from competitors and silent installation of their combined products. They have been doing things like force removal of original games (Infinity Blade, Naruto, and so on) from the app store to publish their ""Modified Version"" which focus more about pay-to-win aspects. They've copied Don't Starve Mods directly from Steam Workshop without permission. They claim that League of Legends is developed by original developers of DotA when promoting it in China. But they never really care about what is called ""player satifaction"" like quality of server or fair competition between players. The reason why Tencent has become such a large company is because of the local company protection policy in China. Due to the fact that most people in China never heard about any high-standard games and Tencent product controls everything they could see, they are still making considerable amount of money without even produced any Triple-A title. If Tencent managed to make a steady foundation in the field of game publishing in China, they will for sure work with the government to ban the entire Steam Service access in China, just like what Baidu did to Google (yes, Google is banned in China, the next is Steam?).I'm currently a college student from China, studying the field of Game Design in the U.S. and wish to be an indie developer in the future. I've been playing Rocket League on Xbox for a while, and I bought it on Steam just to tell everyone what the game industry is like in China. A company without any great titles (Hey, did you heard any game developed by Tencent?) is monopolying the entire market there, and they only offers less then 30% of share when publishing games for indie developers (consider that Steam offers 70%) which is a nightmare to any indie developers.We, as gamers who always want to see games being produced into a higher and higher quality, here need to UNITE against those who destroys the market and turns everything into pay-to-win. We want a platform where great games are great and pushed to more people, not a one where ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games dominates the chart because of bribe with the seller. Sorry for taking your time reading this. Rocket League itself is a really good game (I love it a lot), but the developers made a terrible choice to work with Tencent games, and that's why I'm giving this negative review. Whenever Tencent is no longer the agent publisher of Rocket League in China, I will immediately turn this review into a positive recommendation.			",31,9,1,7,18,0,7

												Absolutely Brilliant game and would recommend this game to anyone on Windows ;). It's simple mechanics make the game just brilliant. But this isn't just like every other game because when you start playing competitive, you'll turn around and say to yourself ""I'm pretty good at this game!"". You'll play you're placement matches and then get your rank, and as you progress up through the ranks you'll see people do stuff and you'll say ""That's Impossible!"". You'll watch a few youtube videos and get better, remap keys, buy a controller, buy keys, open crates, be dissapointed, find out about trading. Think you're a pro and say ""I'm going to trade from nothing to something"", then get frustrated, give up. Play 1's get mad, uninstall the game, Reinstall it. To put it simply if you like this game you like it and get hooked if you dont you play it for an hour or so and get bored. But let's be honest your not going to buy this at full price you'll get it in the sale for £6 or $8 so do what you want and have fun. -Disclaimer I may be a little bit biased liking the game alot ;)-Kiosion			",43,6,1,1,3,0,0

I can enjoy and get into it without any real problems. Just gotta be in the right mood. I mostly just enjoy playing with friends casually. I'm really not any good. But its also fun to watch.  So any sports haters out there. This is actually not that bad. Catch it while its on sale, try it out, have a blast, win. Lotsa fun! Cheers~			",91,106,2,6,37,2,12

												Such a great game. I'm not a fan of sports or that much into racing games, but damn this won me over. If this was a sport, I'd be in the pub watching it.This game is seriously the kind of game that you can jump in whenever you want, and have a blast. What's even more amazing is how well the online play works in combination with local multiplayer. Me and a friend gaming on the couch in vertical split screen against people online. Not many developers these days cater to PC gamers the way they cater to console gamers, but Psyonix did just that. There's also a huge online community thanks to cross platform play with PS4.I've owned the game for two days and have put in over 20 hours already. I am having a blast.			",948,349,23,135,77,8,101

You'll be addicted like an home alone 5yr old kid who knows where the peanut butter is. You'll suck your fingers every time you score a goal and you'll wake up your family screaming GOAL as you do a barrel roll and score the most incredible goal. The controls are sleek and the matchmaking thing is fast. I hope the game will have more matchmaking things like leagues and tournaments. Easy to have fun, hard to master fully, I recommend it to everyone, especially if you have friends to play with.			",211,54,6,23,13,2,24

Detailed Review by AshesSummaryRocket League is a multiplayer soccer game with rocket cars instead of human players developed by Psyonix and a sequel to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. It includes a range of different cars, arenas, cosmetics and gets constant updates which add new content, tweaks and bug fixes.Cars and all the different unlockables are purely cosmetic and make absolutely no difference in gameplay, all of the new arenas are free which means the community does not get divided when new ones come out. The currently released paid dlc packs are simply cosmetic items and do not change gameplay or give any advantages to the buyers beside bragging rights.One thing that I like a fair lot is that there are no gimmicks and no unlockable advantages.  Everything you have in Rocket League, you have from the beginning itself and the only important factor is your skill. This is how competitive games should be made. Nothing makes a player who has more hours superior to you except his skill, it's plain and simple.GameplayRocket League is fairly easy to learn, but oh god is it hard to master. You can drive around, use your boost, jump, propel your car into the air with the boost, launch your car forward or in any other major direction and one often overlooked feature is the ability to spin your car around in mid air.There are several match types: 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4. Each of them excluding the 4v4 have ranked versions if you feel extra competitive. When a match starts you spawn at one of several possible locations on the arena and the ball spawns at the center. Both teams rush to the ball for the first hit. Like in traditional football there is one goal on each side of the field and the objective is to score into the enemy team's goal while protecting your own. Scattered through the arena are boost fill-ups which can be picked up from both sides of the field regardless of your team.In terms of competitiveness Rocket League nails it, the complete lack of perks and upgrades make the outcome of matches rely purely on your skill and a hint of luck every now and then. Gameplay is exceptionally fun and enjoyable, you'll probably spend your first few matches hopelessly driving around the field not even touching the ball, but after a while you'll eventually get the hang of it and learn when to go for the ball, when to strike and how to position yourself among a lot of other things. As silly as the concept of rocket car football might sound, Rocket League is a very competitive game which even managed to secure its position as an electronic sport.The way a match progresses is fairly simple and much like real life football. After every goal the players and ball reset and both teams rush towards the ball for the first hit much like in the beginning of the game. If you end up tying a match overtime takes place and the first team to score wins. Overtime doesn't have any sort of time limit so a match can go on until your fingers fall off and your eyes melt.Matches are a team based effort and while it may be easy to win one of them in lower ranks without being a team player you will find that without proper communication and strategy you cannot win in the higher ranks. This brings me to another point, one particularly frustrating thing is that players can abandon matches without any form of punishment and to make matters even worse when a player leaves a ranked match no new player can connect in his/her place, which makes you are stuck with a bot. A system that punishes people for leaving games would be very welcome.Arenas, Cars and Car CustomizationThere are 5 different arenas and each of them has its own theme and some have different variations, but note that they do not affect gameplay whatsoever, but instead offer a nice and welcome change of scenery. All of them have a lot of detail and provide you with loads of eye candy.Different cars offer completely cosmetic changes and so do car customization options. There is a total of 14 cars including the dlc ones so far and more than a few hats, wheel types, boost effects etc., the only thing lacking variety are the decals. Unfortunately there are only 5 decals per car and the game doesn't let you move them around your car or re-size them in any way, but you can change their color.Graphics and SoundRocket League is absolutely gorgeous offering a lot of detail in both graphical and sound quality. The game is so detailed that you can literally see each individual piece of grass on the field. The soundtrack is perfect for a sports game like this and the sound effects are absolutely nailed. There are a lot of small details everywhere and if you have a powerful enough PC to max this game out you will surely be astonished by its graphical beauty.A very small, but nice little detail I've noticed is that each type of boost effect has its own different sound effect. Every time a goal is scored the ball explodes in a mixture of paint and fireworks and lets out a very satisfying explosion sound. As much as I try I can't find anything to complain about regarding the graphics and sound of this game.Technical DetailsRocket League is very well optimized, has no fps lock and a constant reliable framerate, a full PC interface and it supports gamepads, it has more than enough graphical, sound and game options. You can fully rebind your keys with both keyboards and controllers. I have to warn people with weaker or/and older systems that it might be difficult for them to run the game even at lower settings because it's pretty demanding. Everything you'd expect to be included in a game like this already is. We have cross-platform play with PlayStation users as well as split screen co-op on PC. After playing this for a fair bit of time, I even think that the PC version was simultaneously developed with the PS4 one instead of being ported, correct me if I'm wrong.All bugs and problems usually get fixed withing a span of several days and the game is constantly supported by the devs. One of my only problems with Rocket League is its servers. Sometimes, despite having really low ping I get disconnected or start lagging all over the place. This can be especially frustrating in ranked matches where losing can lower the rank you've worked so hard to reach.ConclusionI've enjoyed all of my time playing this. It was incredibly fun to play with random people online, but even more fun with my friends. Gameplay is spot on, PC version is amazing and probably better than the console one, every feature I would want is implemented and the whole thing is just beautiful.This sort of purely skill-based gameplay is what more competitive games should be. No perks, no nuttin'. Just you and your team against the opposing team. Matches are short and intense and there is no big learning curve which means the game is really easy to get into for newcomers.I recommend this to anyone. If you are just looking for something casual and fun you'll definitely like it and if you are looking for something competitive and hard to master you're just bound to love it.PROSSkill-based gameplayExceptionally funEasy to learn, hard to masterInfinite replayabilityA decent selection of carsA lot of customization options excluding decalsMindblowingly beautiful graphics and great soundtrackGreat fun with friendsCross-platform play and split-screenPC version is amazingCONSServers aren't that greatA sparse selection of decals for carsDemanding system requirementsNo punishment for players abandoning matchesWhen someone leaves a ranked match no one can connect in his/her place ",415,63,2,17,25,4,25

												Excellent game. Not much to say apart from the fact that it's a game that looks great (graphics) and relatively cheap. Each game is on a 5 minute timer so it's a game you can pick up for a few minutes and put down again when you're just killing time.I've spent a lot of time playing this game in gaming pubs on laptops with friends and that is the perfect atmosphere to play this game. Drink, have a laugh and score some goals.You can play casually and just enjoy playing, eventually you'll actually get quite good. Or you can play seriously and competitively and run through the tutorials for some extra help. This is the type of game where the more you play, the better you'll become.  As you understand the physics more and get used to the way the ball moves, you'll just know where you have to be in order to score that incredible high goal.Basically there is no reason not to get this game.

												This game should be the next E-Sport!Who would have thought combining Football(soccer) with cars would be such fun? You can play 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and even 4v4. The game has matchmaking, A.I. players, and even ranked matches so you can see how you match up with everyone else.A unique feature is you can cross-play this with PS4 users who have the game. Future updates will expand upon this to allow you to create parties with your PC/PS4 friends.Everyone out there seems to be playing this game, and with good reason.You owe it to yourself to get this one and play with your friends, or make new ones!

												This game man this game is the juice everything you could all want and serving up to its purpose of entertainment unlike any other game.MenuIt's the best i have seen so far it's easy as hell to navigate through and pretty next-gen as well stylish.Music It's perfect suits the game in every single way there are a wide variety and most of them being electronic it's easy to listen to and enjoyable at the same time just perfect.Gameplay It's fun as damm and playing football/soccer with cars really who wouldn't want that? And the best part of all FIFA has nothing to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to do with it. Wide variety of moves and it never feels unfair due to every car having the same states just different hitboxes which I doubt make a difference at all.Controls The control's here are silk as smooth response as hell man just perfect response easy to get the hang of it. Many say this game is better with playing with a ""controller"" but it's not necessary with keyboard it's all fine just takes a little while to get the hang of it.Split screen Yes there's split screen multiplayer and offline split screen. You are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ kidding me right are you? No I'm not it really really has spilt screen going up to 4 players just amazing just amazing I have yet to see this in any new game and yet rocket league does it like a B.0.S.S.Customization Customization does not serve any purpose in gameplay it's all cosmetic effect but really who doesn't like it?I mean making your car fire rainbows and all that♥♥♥♥♥♥up your♥♥♥♥♥In all seriousness it's down right amazing just perfect you unlock a cosmetic item every time you complete a match there are 150 cosmetic items/effects in total and more going up in future.Conclusion The hell are you waiting for and buying all those Early Access ""Survival"" games huh really?Just stop it really just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stop it and buy rocket league only 20 dollars man cheaper then all the canes of beers you just bought today.A simple idea but done right. amazing and fun to play. polished around the corner. great sound's and ost. matching environments and nice graphics.===================================================================Click me and follow us as Curator ",167,22,8,12,13,2,29

YouTube™ Video: Rocket League [Game Review]

			My review of ""Rocket League"", the 2015 multiplayer racing soccer game developed and published by Psyonix. ------------------------------- Like on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/EnjoyTheGaming...		

Game: Rocket LeagueGenre: Multiplayer Racing Soccer GameDeveloper: PsyonixPublisher: PsyonixCopy supplied by SteamRocket League is a multiplayer racing soccer game developed and published by Psyonix. I am telling you already: go out and buy this game, it is one of the best games of this generation.GRAPHICSMade with the Unreal engine, it looks very damn great: particle effects, lighting, shadows, textures... Everything is well done. The only real nitpick I have are the arena: excluding the ones in Rocket Labs, there is nothing that makes each level unique other than a few changes in the background. But the physics are fantastic.GAMEPLAYThe game is very simple: it is soccer, but with cars equipped with rockets instead of players. You can boost, you can jump, and you can double jump. That is it. Is it simple? Yeah. But is it done perfectly? Hell yeah!There are many game modes to choose from: 1v1 duel, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, Rocket Labs (experimental maps), Snow (that no one is playing), and the new Hoops (basketball). There is great variety, and each mode is fun to play. Each time you finish a game, you will get a reward, ranging from hats to flags to customize your car and make it your own.CHALLENGEThe bots can be pretty dumb, usually doing autogoals for no reason at all, and other times they are incredibly hard to beat. The game is very easy to understand and even to master, so almost every player will be a threat.SOUNDThe soundtrack to the game is fine, and the sound effects are okay.REPLAYABILITYThere is plenty of money for your buck: each round usually lasts around 5 minutes, and you will quickly notice that you have spent three consecutive hours saying ""One more, and then I'll sleep"". The achievements also require some skills and not easy to achieve tactics, like scoring a goal while reversing.Overall, Rocket League is a top notch game that is a must buy for every gamer out there who has a decent Internet connection: fun, addicting, challenging. What more do you want?Story: n/aGraphics: 8.5Gameplay: 10Challenge: 9Sound: 7.5Replayability: 10ENJOYMENT: 10FRUSTRATION: 7.5Follow me on Twitter: @nickygra97Subscribe to my channelLike on FacebookJoin my Steam group ",532,126,11,40,24,4,34

												Probably one of the most fun and addictive game that came out in a long, long time. Very simple game, fun mechanics and lots of depth for advanced players. Add your friends to the mix and you got some really good stuff.EDIT BELOW:The greatest game ever just gets better. Psyonix has really just listened to the community over and over and over and provided/fixed/added pretty much all we've wanted thus far.I just can't get enough of this game, it's been a blast and still is and I don't see myself stopping any time soon. Their support for the game as well as the crate funded tournaments will be sure to keep this game going for years to come and I, for one, cannot wait to see what they add next.A game made even better when you play with friends both online or offline.

												I play this too much.I'm sure you've already heard numerous great things about this game. I can definitely agree to them. This game screams fun regardless of if you've played 1 hour or 1000 hours. Even if you're losing, you find yourself having fun. And that's the mark of a seriously great game, in my eyes.Rocket League can be played casually or competitively, boasting both unranked and ranked queues. It is a simple enough concept that people are already familiar with even before playing their first game (it's damn soccer dude, if you don't know you've been living under a rock very far away from Europe, possibly on the moon Europa). But then, it has such an incredibly high skillcap. You'd probably still be learning new manouevres and the like well into 2000 hours (give it time though).I don't play with a controller as I don't own one, but I know that 99% of people recommend controller over keyboard/mouse. And from an unbiased standpoint, I would agree, as the analogs make ball control and fine movement much easier than WASD or the like. Regardless, if you do choose to play keyboard like a dummie (read: like me), then consider making a custom bind that doesn't use the mouse.I could go on and on. But I'll let the game do the talking; go buy it. Believe me, for $20, this is an absolute ♥♥♥♥ing steal. Best $20 I ever spent tbh.10/10 would play again (actually am playing as I write this)-Swate			",77,37,2,6,10,3,13

												This one is a masterpiece, shining like a diamond in my Steam Collection. Soccer with cars? Why not! The learning curve presented here is one of the greatest I've seen in years, both rewarding and satisfying. You can actually feel and see how much better you're becoming after every single hour spent in Rocket League. Developers are pushing updates and fixes every single month, often surprising us with completely new game modes like Rumble and Hoops. Wanna hear more? All updates are free of charge! DLC's are not ""PayToWin"" contest offering small visual enhancements instead.tl;dr BEST. GAME. EVER.Buy ASAP			",16,0,0,2,1,0,0

												The first game I've bought on steam and it was so worth it.It's a game with a good, steep skill curve to climb as well as a nice, new and upcoming community for Indians (in particular).Play with your friends over a big screen and enjoy boosting around, demolishing players, flying around, flailing about the ball.Hand the controller over to someone and watch them amazed as they climb up the walls, score a goal for the first time. Super fun and addictive. A must buy.P.S. I think to climb the skill curve, a controller is necessary. ",116,8,0,2,2,0,4

												Rocket League is one of my favourite games of the year. I haven't played anything else since I bought it and even after over 40 hours I am still wanting to play it at every opportunity I have. I know others have experienced server issues but this is something I have not had trouble with. Though being in Australia likely helps as there is probably less traffic on the OC servers and less people playing overall during our peak time. There a few little bugs, such as invisible players, that happen now and then but nothing a quick reconnect cant fix. The developers seem great and I am looking forward to seeing where they take this game.Overall one of the best $20 I have spent!			",218,50,12,12,34,6,46

												I bought this game when it was really young, it was around a month after release. At the beginning the game was really difficult to play, but after a while you will master it. You should ONLY play this game if you have some kinda controller, cause with Keyboard and Mouse it is almost impossible to play this game. Think about this for yourself and decide if you want to own this game:- Like to smash cars? BUY IT!- Like to fly like never before? BUY IT!- Like racing and football? BUY IT!I really recommend it. It's the best game I have ever played so far. Why? Almost every month there is a new DLC or update for the game, so it keeps me really exited! 10/10 IGN.			",528,206,20,100,82,17,100

												Addictive Racecar Football. Surprisingly competitive once you learn a few basic maneuveres, after this you begin to climb the skill tier. Simple yet efficient tiers break up the skill gaps into pools at a decent rate for beginners. As a rookie you will spalsh around with the other casuals and gain a grasp for hitting the ball and maintaining control of the car. Next comes Semi-pro, in this pool you start to get a feel and learn to see where the ball is flying and position yourself accordingly. At Pro you're on your way, this is where the community opens up and stratergies become more meta and kick offs take some priority. Veteran feels like you're being thrown in teh deep end because higher tier Veterans have advanced onto flying with that car and Aerials become the go to plan of attack. Expert is where Crossing is how to beat the defence line having someone in the air to topple enemy teams. There are three higher tiers but im not quite there, being Master > Legend > Rocketeer. Occasionally ther servers are overloaded or lack some players so you get to be the big fish and splash around with lower tier players while the game finds some players more suited. Constant DLC is a awesome bonus, and new Mutator gamemodes make for an awesome custom mode with friends.Overall a decent game, whether you're a PS4 Casual to a Competitive Player it suites all.

												No more than two minutes (maybe even one) since you opened the game and you're already looking at the ball, waiting for the countdown to finish, your little radio-controlled engine revving up, not knowing what your opponent will try, not knowing if your teammates are aware of what YOU will try. The countdown is over and two cars (or four, or six, or eight) lunge at the ball, all those colored and crazy boost trails converging at the center, a single thump, a mess of antennae, cars flying all over the place, the ball going up and away and everyone scrambles to send it to the opponent's side of the field. You zig-zag around, you and your team hitting your best shots, the opponent hitting their best saves, until finally a small mistake and you score. Or get scored.The replay kicks in, you relax a bit and realize something: It's been 15 seconds since the game started.Nostalgic in its simplicity, more than modern in its presentation, Rocket League is like Fifa Street meets Re-Volt with extra rockets. A game that wants you to get in and get flying as soon as possible and keeps you playing not with shady design decisions but with pure and fast competitive action. An amazing reminder that sometimes less is much better. Worth the full price or even more if you ask me.Oh, and last but not least: hats for your cars.			",358,43,8,24,20,2,29

 An Amazing Sports GamePeople have plenty of misconceptions about this game. Its not simply soccer with cars.Rocket League is an adrenaline-pumping, itch-feeding, finger-mashing, explosive sports game. It is the result of a great clusterball of imagination, vision and execution. You control a car, with rocket boosts that allow you to manouver in the air, jump and perform bicycle kicks. Unlike regular football fields, you are playing in a specially designed cages that allow you free movement. Since the fields are closed, the action runs seamlessly.The biggest difference that derails from the old formula of sports game is the fact that you only control a single entity. You do not switch from one ragdoll to another to perform incredible feats. You communicate with one-another on an electric level that when executed perfectly sends chill down your spine. With insane avatars capable of withstanding the severest laws of gravity, the presence of each individual in the field matter. Not once or twice, the game countlessly put you in exhilarating situations akin to football strikers: preventing a tiebreaker from being scored during the last moments of the round or giving an impossible sommersault pass with the last sliver of nitros that leads to an impressive aerial goal by your teammate. Instead of placing features that exist in today's meta, Rocket League opted for a more traditional approach. You will find no such character progression, career mode or ability unlocks in this game. What will keep you playing will simply be the charm of performing stunning moves, outmanouvering and outsmarting your opponents over and over again, one game after another. It's just another 5 minutes after all...Additional comments apart from Core Gameplay (+good / -bad)+ Wonderful aesthetics/colour palette+ Amazing Soundtracks+ Ability to practice while queueing- Server Issues- Matchmaking problemsUpdated 2016.

												When released, I marked the game as ""Not Interested"" almost instantly because I don't dig neither soccer nor racing games that much.Then, I bought a Steam Controller when it became available through the Steam Store, thus, I received a copy of Rocket League (along Portal 2) but I didn't bothered at all and soon I forgot about.One of my Steam friends noticed my Rocket League in his Steam Activity feed and asked me to install the game. I said NO.The next day he asked me again to install the game. Again, I said NO. For the next two months or so he kept on asking me to install the game on a daily basis to no avail and I began to dislike the game even more because of that.One night I had literaly nothing to do, so I decided to install Rocket League but not to give it a chance but for my friend to stop asking me to. After the brief tutorial I lost track of time and realised I had been playing for about two hours. At the same time, my friend bought a Four Pack and shared the copies with some of our friends; at the blink of an eye we were all hooked into the game.In less than a week, 25 of us (and growing) already have the game and fell addicted harder than with heroin to the point of keep on playing for 7 continuous hours:

PROS:- Addictive gameplay.- Lots of fun.- Easy to play.- Keyboard n' mouse playable.- Colorful visuals.- Great music.- Several game modes either online or local.- Powered by Unreal Engine.- Cross platform: you can play with friends that are in either PS4 or PC.- ""Mutators"": you can change the behavior of several things.- Highly suggested to play with your friends.- Lots of fun/sarcastic/senseless customizations.CONS:- Just a few stadiums to choose from.- Most of the cars' aesthetics look like they were designed by a toddler.- You can only choose from two team colors (orange or blue) when playing closed/private matches.- DLC's are somewhat irrelevant unless you really wish those extra cars and soundtrack, otherwise, get the base game.

												Rocket League is one of those games that pop up every once in awhile and make a statement and a change. The simplicity of the game which the eye first meets, to the fine complexity of the game that is not first seen but learned through experience is what makes the game so great. When you first start out you may not realize you can even double jump or fly, yet the game is still so fun. Then you spend some time playing your judgement gets better and you learn to make moves effectively in order to be competitive. You then notice there is training and so on and so forth you start changing camera settings and button layouts so you can be as effective as possible. This game has so many layers to it. Iv noticed there's a really steep learning curve to this game and then you plateau for awhile. Then you kind of step your way up and up as you then notice you have a few hundred hours into the game and your still not bored. Iv never seen a game that can keep me so addicted to and yet it's such a simple idea. What makes it great to me is how there is no aid in shooting or blocking it's your rocket car against physics and gravity with your car as the force to change its directing. It is so satisfying to score a game winning goal or the game winning save for your team. Once you start playing with friends and communicating you realize how serious it gets. I can't think of anything that's bad about this game the work they are doing is great and now Xbox one is coming into the cross play making it one of if not the first games to allow PC, PS4, and XBOX ONE to play together. If you have not bought this game and I was one who looked over it a few times but still had it on the back of my mind it was one of those, oh if I have an extra $20 I'll buy it. NOOO if you have the money I don't care what your plan was with that $50 steam card this game is a must have and I'm sure every single rocket league player can say the same thing there's much more than to what meets the eye.

												Rocket League is, as description claims, a sequel to a PS3 game with an overly complicated title that probably contributed to the fact that not many people have heard about it. Neither have I, so when I watched a video of Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, I was surprised to learn that Psyonix basically got the whole formula down with their first attempt; mechanics have hardly changed since the first entry into what might be now considered a sort of a franchise. That Rocket League is now enjoying far more success than its predecessor is very clear. Some of it may be down to the good timing since it doesn't have to compete with any AAA behemoth, some to PS+ free release and its very important strength: it is highly watchable and thus enjoyed free promotion from streamers and youtube personalities. But it doesn't fully explain the explosion of entusiasm it garnered. I think the main reason is that it's almost a perfect execution of its idea. It's addictive, but demanding. Fun from the getgo, but surprisingly deep in terms of its mechanics. If you have all these elements and add polish the result is an extremely engrossing competitive online game. You start off by simply attempting to hit a ball, preferably in the direction of the enemy's goal, but in the beginning every hit feels like a success. As you learn to have more control over the car, which thanks to the tactile responsiveness of controls happens at a rather quick pace, you find yourself mixing in more advanced techniques to gain the edge over the enemy. Occasionally you will manage to pull off an impressive move and you will want that to make this a norm. Once you get your technique down to an acceptable level it's no longer enough: you need to ""read the pitch"", predict your opponents' moves, cooperate with your teammates (or not, if you choose to play only 1v1 which you're entirely free to do!). This aspect of the game is hard to overstate.  Playing Rocket League constantly demands and leaves room for improvement, both individual and team-based and given that player base is currently huge and matchmaking great, you're going to matched against players just right for you.  There is always one caveat that applies to every online game in existence: your mileage may vary. If you're unlucky, you may very well have unpleasant experience with it. You might end up with a series of online problems or bugs. You might very well not be so drawn in by the mechanics or be in the minority of people this game doesn't resonate with. But I say: buy. It's unlikely any of it will apply to you, and if the price is the only source of doubt for you, wait for the first sale and get it then, though in my opinion it's well worth the price of admission.

												Rocket League is next game of Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. Both game is a physic-based vehicle soccer game. But they improved game a lot since SARPBC.-This game has a lot of content.(Maps, DLC packs, Ranked play etc.)-Car costumization really good. You can make however you want your car.-There is 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4 game modes available and you can play this modes as ranked.-Ranked system changed now. It's much better than number based rank system.-They're now making competitive tournaments offically.I think they will improve it in the future.-They're adding several mods but they usually remove them later.-Game has some optimization issues i think usually show itself at low end pc systems.I definitely recommend this game. Community growing up and will be bigger in the future.			",157,15,4,12,10,2,12

												If you want a new type of game, none of that Moba/FPS crap you have played on multiple different games but yet it still feels the same then Rocket League is a new game you can learn and have a bit of fun with. If you think that you won't like this because you hate football then trust me I thought the same thing but as soon as you start trying to jump and hit that ball in the net with your car you are going to forget about what you first thought about the game and love the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it. -Unique Idea-DLC Cars look awesome (a bit costly if you hunt achievments as you will need all of the DLC for them)-Taught me ball controlThe only thing I find a bit meh about this game is that you have to spend money on the keys for crates which is alright I guess if you would like a chance at the rare items but not my kind of thing.

Best competitive gameFootball (for US colleagues Soccer) with cars, double jumps, rotket boost in the a$$ and some level of car customization. These words can describe rocket league in whole. Oh and yes, you can play now against our console colleagues which creates really broad spectrum of talents through all the platforms so u will definetly find your place there. This game can be categorised as ""Easy to learn, hard to master"" game. The basics are the same, only the cars differ in some slight characteristics. It all comes to your skill. Check some of my videos on my profile of this game so you can see what all you can do there ;) GOOD things:  Fun Can fly and score amazing shots Competitive (even ranked play) Addictive Easy to learn, hard to master - skill matters Many mods and maps Teamwork over solo skill - as in every team game (tested by experience) Massive Replay possibilities BAD things:  Addictive Hard to climb the ranked ladder without good teammates Many kids and ragers - rly have to have good friends to enjoy the gameplay ",1138,402,32,139,117,14,186

												HOTSHOT my friend already gave a fantastic review, so I will talk about one very important aspect to decide before buying the game:Keyboards vs. ControllersI never had to use a gamepad, okay sometimes I did for 2-player sessions on the same computer, but apart from that, this is the first time where I had to realize, controllers do give you the edge. And you need it if you don't want to uninstall the game after seeing others performing stunts practically impossible with the keyboard.In a very fast-paced game like RL keyboard handling can easily turn out sub-par, as the followings are difficult to do:Problems with keyboards* Precision turning in a very short amount of time. Keyboard is not analog, so you have 2 choices: hold A/D/W/S and release when done, or tap those buttons in a rapid succession. You will find that you are going to be slower than guys with controllers.* Acceleration and aerial turning forward is bound to the same key (W), so you would have to release W before flying in the desired direction. But, it is just too easy to forget, and you might end up forward flipping.Not all controllers are supported!This is one annoying feature, but after realizing that I would never become pro with a keyboard, I thought I could just dust off my old gamepad that I used to play NHL/FIFA/Mortal Kombat/NFS games with, but no, RL didn't even bother telling a message to me that, ""no I will just ignore your ***** controller!""So you will need either an Xbox 360 controller for PC (either wired or wireless, doesn't matter, as long as it is for PC you will get a suitable USB cable with it), or what is better: an Xbox One controller for PC. Why better? People say the sticks feel better, so you will feel them easier to handle.Oh yeah and PS controllers might work too but they aren't as convenient.Will I need to install a driver?No, at least on Windows 10 it's like plug and play.How the controller works in the gameIf you never had an Xbox controller like me, first thing to notice as a difference from regular controllers is that it has only 2 front buttons, rather than 4, and they will work like this:Front right button: accelerationFront left button: breaking / going backwardsTop left stick: turning (on ground and aerial)A: jumping / pressing accept buttons in dialogsB: nitro boostX: driftingY: changing camera mode / pressing cancel buttonsTop right stick: camera angleD-pad: navigation in the menuHardest parts are getting used to:Accelerating and going backwards with the buttons on the frontAcceleration + nitro boosting + forward flipping at the same time (note: actually with nitro no need to accelerate)Not accidentally hitting the jump button when you want to use the nitro boost.ConclusionAt first it will be very hard to get used to the controller, it's like learning the game again, I actually went through the tutorials again, it felt really dumb. But keep practicing, because in the end I am pretty sure you will beat the guys using a keyboard having the same skill level as you.			",129,9,4,4,11,3,10

												So where do I start...I read somewhere that the game is or was free for Playstation Live, yet PC users had to pay so that is extremely crappy!Anyway, the game itself, that is why we are here.Graphics: The graphics are actually pretty simple, pushed to the max that are nice to look at, simple and just nothing special really.  You do not need high resolution graphics for a game like this!Audio: The audio is clear, crisp and really good to listen too, specially the rocket sounds of each trail you have, being different and acting different!Controls: Depending how you play this game, the controls matter! I tried keyboard and mouse and although it is doable, it is a lot more complicated! I use an Xbox 360 controller to play this game, with BALL CAM always on and the game is suprt easy to master!Gameplay: The gameplay is basically football but with cars... Nothing special or hard to get your head around.  There are some amazing players in the game, with some amazing shots you can make and for some odd reason, playing this game actually makes me intense and tense up at times, when taking a shot. The game is good fun and I would recommend this game if you like cars and/ or football... I hate football games but love car games and surprisingly this game offers an amazing balance of rockets, cars with a kinda football elemant, but in no way makes you feel like a football game.The unlocks in the game you can get within a few hours, seriously it does not take long at all!This game is now an E-Sports league thingy I heard, too which I am not interested in that but you can try to enter for it!This is best to play with your friends, bringing you more fun.Would I recommend this game? Yes!			",868,187,72,84,117,12,187

Public Review on behalf of the Opium Pulses Steam groupFew words about the gameRecently bought this game with few of my friends and we became addicted to it. You will have really nice time playing it, with your friends or without them as people are quite nice in matchmaking. Good and simple action packed game. Movement is quite simple but really takes alot of time to perfectly master it. This game have everything you need to relieve from CS:GO rage.Advantages - Game handles very well, doesn't matter if you play on keyboard or controller - Matchmaking is good and quick - AMAZING soundtrack - Suprisingly good graphics - Takes time to master ""movement"" what makes you want to play more to be better at itDisadvantages - Playing against bots is pointless, you could aswell take an empty court - From time to time there are little troubles with connection - Really, like... REALLY addictiveIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games! ",550,201,17,52,35,7,58

												I am hopeless at this game, but I keep coming back to it. It's so good. It's one of those games that are very nearly perfect, as evidenced by the large playerbase.""Easy to learn but hard to master"" sums it up. Simple controls, pleasing visuals and music, exciting gameplay, and plenty of game modes that all follow the same basic principles, making them easy to get into.The kind of game you can pick up for a quick 15 minutes session, or keep throwing yourself at it for hours. The kind you can enjoy casually, or focus on being the best and going up the ranks.Cons: the biggest, most serious drawback is the terrible, horrible netcode. You better have a great Internet connection, or the game will be unplayable for you.The developers keep adding more fun stuff to do as well as optional cosmetics. They're doing it right.Super enjoyable game. And, sorry if I caused our team to lose.			",990,397,39,52,75,8,39

												Overall, this game is awesome. Yes, I know that it is $20 but, it's worth it. After 1 game of it, i got hooked. I love the idea of racing and soccer combined. The Graphics are incredible. A cool feature of this is that you can even customize your car with many combinations. Another great thing in this game is the soundtrack. The one downside (doesn't affect me) is that you will most likely need a high end computer to run this game without lag.                                                                                       ***Rating***                                                                                  Graphics: 9.5/10                                                                                  Gameplay: 10/10                                                                                      Audio: 9/10                                                                                Multiplayer: 8.5/10                                                                                  OVERALL: 9.75/10			",39,2,2,5,9,2,6

												Mario Kart, Twisted Metal, Unreal Soccer mod and Fifa all got together one night for some drinks...One thing led to another....Long story short, alot of whiskey was consumed, alot of sex took place and sure enough.. 9 months later a baby was born....Everyone, welcome Rocket League to the world :)More Thoughts on the game?Rocket League is just a ton of fun, if you enjoy good gameplay check this out. When you have a team working together it is a thing of beauty. You might be helping out on offense alot one game, while another player might be making some great saves coming back on defense, or you all might do a little of everything, etc.. Teamwork is rewarded and if you are at all interested in this game pick it up asap. The graphics look nice, it runs well, its a joy to play and the controls are well done, get your engines started and get ready for some action packed fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rocket League is a physics-based vehicular soccer video game developed and published by Psyonix. The game was first released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 in July 2015, with a version for Xbox One and beta versions for OS X and Linux being released in 2016. A physical retail version for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One began being distributed by 505 Games in June 2016.This game is really fun, it gives hours of fun with or without your friends, it varies in game modes such as football (soccer) basketball and ice hockey, my personal favourite has got to be soccer, you can spend hours perfecting your touch of the game, by improving ariel strikes, ground striking, goalkeeping, it's endless. It is filled with a great community which can make you a lot of new friends! Once you've gotten better and played a lot at perfecting your touch, you can play more competetive by playing ranked, it's like normal but obviously harder and more competetive. I would definetly recommend this, it has hours of fun, which seems to never end being fun. I would give this a 9/10, it's very fun and I hope to play more.			",129,18,1,16,22,1,11

												500+ hours and I'm still learning new things about how to hit the ball and coordinate with teammates. Ranked is very intense and a blast. People are generally open to teaming up and I've made a lot of friends on this game already. There's a very real sense of progression with both a cumulative rank and a skill rank. It's absurd, it's thrilling, it's hilarious, it's endlessly challenging, and it's addicting. Pay whatever they ask. Just get the game.			",126,33,4,16,25,7,33

The feeling  of coordinating with your teammates and playing strategically makes it all the more fun All in all its instantly a surprise hit of the year and one of my all-time favourite games.

												REALLY fun multiplayer and cross platform so there's alot of people playing.  The game is fast and simple but very slick with the flips and moves you can do to hit the giant soccer ball into the goal...or make a great save.  Nice customization on the rocket cars and it doesn't effect the play advantage, just cosmetic fun.  Multiplayer is fun and has alot of options.  I havnt tried sp yet, but there is a season mode.  I only had lag in one game so far out of about 20 or so. The game has split-screen if you're into that. Do the quick tutorials first.			",462,114,18,74,53,11,67

The learning curve is very little and tutorials/training makes starting out easy.Currently the only con would be the server issues the game are having but of course this is just due to massive amounts of players wanting to play. Give a couple minutes and you will get a game.Highly recommend.			",66,10,2,4,35,2,21

												The proof  that a game doesn't need to be mechanically complex to be compelling. Rocket Leauge is as simple as video games get. But it's tweaked and polished to perfection, making every moment all kill and no fill. And when the game is at it's best moments, whether it be the tense stand offs when all the players rush for the ball at kickoff or 30 seconds left on the clock with a tied scoreboard. It can be genuinely hard to put down. It harks back to simpler times, when video games didn’t need a billion bells and whistles to keep players interested. They just needed great design, and that’s exactly what you get with Rocket League. Soccer with cars. And it's beautiful.			",247,44,6,11,9,3,12

												To start with my review I want to mention that Rocket League is by far the best game I played so far.I put more than 1500 hours into this game and I don't regret any second of it.So let me explain why in my opinion this game is just awesome:First of all, who doesn't like soccer and cars, right? It simply is fascinating not only for adults or children but for everyone.Secondly, the skill ceiling of this game is higher than the skill ceiling I saw in any other game and actual pro players didn't reach that ceiling yet.The cars have differences, yes, but they are not that big of a deal and every hitbox/turning radius can be found in all regular cars so premium DLCs don't give you any advantages.That leads me to my next point: all DLCs are just cosmetic, that means new gamemodes and arenas will be free forever.The match length of 5 minutes is just perfect for both the eSports scene and for just playing a few matches to have fun, although you might find youself some hours later still playing Rocket League because it is that addictive.The developers just manage everything perfectly, yet they were/are just a small company:- Almost every good idea of the community has been implemented in some way, Psyonix works perfectly together with the community.- Almost one and a half year later the game still gets a ton of free updates/improvements and they care about the game and the community as if it just came out, yet they have made alot of money with Rocket League so they could just settle but they don't.- A lot of money from the keys for the crates flues directly into the eSports price pools.There are so many more aspects just as cross-platform gaming that makes the game to the best we have right now in my opinion.Anyway, it just costs 20 bucks, often it is cheaper on steam sales or on third party sites, so just try it, I bet 99,99% of you won't regret it.However, thanks Psyonix for this awesome game!Now I have to get back into Rocket League just to play a few matches which will end in me still sitting here playing in 5 hours...What a game!

												Never had so much fun in any game since a long time. In the beginning it seemed like a fun game with simple controls but as I've progressed far I've realised it has a lot of depth. The feeling  of coordinating with your teammates and playing strategically makes it all the more fun All in all its instantly a surprise hit of the year and one of my all-time favourite games. I've over 400 hrs in this game,  this is my second account. Everyone should buy this game, it's a must have for every type of gamer..  xD			",16,0,0,0,2,0,0

												Thought i'd come back and actually do a proper review rather than ""yeah this is fun""I felt that my original statement wasn't as accurate as it could be.This game is REALLY FUN.Price may seem a bit steep, but i've been bashing balls around in my yank van all weekend and i just want to play it more and more. Check out the twitch streamers if you're on the fence, they're what made me buy it.			",192,44,1,24,29,0,26

												I am a hardcore player of DotA2 and CS: Global Offensive. A Clan mate of mine introduced me rocket league just like the other games. He got a 4 Pack and shared it along with us. He used to always pm me about this game and I used to show no interest since it was looking like sonic cars or something like that game. After I played my 1st game which was a 3 v 3, Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥I was astonished about the gameplay.Every competitve online match is just 5 minutes which is so fun. Rating: 10/10 ( I am a Indian, I get 124 ping always which is playable, but looking forward to play on Indian servers which might make it more IMBA) Thank you Psyonix for this wonderful game.

												500+ hours and I'm still learning new things about how to hit the ball and coordinate with teammates. Ranked is very intense and a blast. People are generally open to teaming up and I've made a lot of friends on this game already. There's a very real sense of progression with both a cumulative rank and a skill rank. It's absurd, it's thrilling, it's hilarious, it's endlessly challenging, and it's addicting. Pay whatever they ask. Just get the game.			",126,33,4,16,25,7,33

												I wasn't sure I'd like this game but playing with my normal group of online friends has been a blast. It's basically car soccer there  are a few skills to be learned rocket boosting into the air and hitting the ball etc but for the most part its pretty simple; try to hit the ball into the opponents goal. It's also pretty good for local multiplayer as it has splitscreen functionality. It's often on sale for 13 or less  and you really don't need the dlc so I def recommend if you even think you may like it.			",271,14,47,4,6,7,16

												You don't need to enjoy sports or racing games to like this game! I'm not a big fan of either genre but this game must be one of my favourite games ever.Load of fun online, especially with friends. You don't have to be good to enjoy it - but you get good just by playing. Bots are annoying to play both with or against once you have played for a few hours, but otherwise brilliant game with incredible devs.There is a very high skill ceiling to this game, and the competitive mode has done very well to make the most of this. You probably won't get bored of this game if you enjoy it, especially if you play with friends.Edit: Each update is brilliant. The developers have done an amazing job with this game and they deserve all the praise they have recieved. The Rumble gamemode they recently released is incredibly fun. I couldn't recommend this game more.			",152,32,7,7,14,2,15

A fun and refreshing soccer gameAlthough this game is not the first time where cars and soccer have been put into the same game, this is a refreshing game to many that feels like something new. It is a game with a simple concept, it is loads of fun as so many things can happen in a match that makes it exciting every time, such as an epic save or goal. Playing with friends is definitely recommended as i find its the way to play that i found brings the most fun, but if you solo queue it is still exciting. The controls in the game are simple to use and playing with a keyboard is very doable. This game is definitely worth the price and will bring many hours of fun!			",559,133,27,50,58,15,66

It's a great game that will keep you occupied for any amount of time you allow.They have consistently added new content for free and new cars as paid DLCs. I really enjoy the underwater maps that they recently added and the resemblence to rapture from Bioshock (one of my favorite game series). My favorite DLC car is the Delorian Time Machine.On a different note, I'm not sure about the new addition of crates and purchasable keys to open said crates. However, it seems to be fine because none of the items you can get in a crate will give you an advantage because of their purely cosmetic nature.

												Soccer/Football with cars.  Easy to learn, difficult to master.  The well polished game has several appealing aspects.  For starters, the games last about five minutes so you can jump in for a quick one.  Matching is mostly based on skill level so you often are paired against fair competition.  The game includes training modes and allows you to play computer opponents so you aren't thrown in the fire right away.  The most significant charm, though, is the craziness.  You have cars ramming each other and balls taking lucky bounces.  You have small mistakes causing a teammate to miss an easy goal.  Or a teammate accidentally knocking a ball into your own goal.  It's hard to fully put in words, but whatever the formula for gaming fun is, it seems like Psyonix has figured it out.			",243,49,1,8,12,0,34

												By now everyone knows what Rocket League is about.I played it since it was in alpha, loved it from the first match.With time all my friends bought it, even the ones that didn't like car/racing games or football.We got countless hours of pure fun out of it. You can play for 10 minutes or 5 hours and still have lots of fun. It's easy to pick up and play, but hard to master.It's cheap, a potato could run it and one of the best coop/competitive games out there.Go ahead and buy it.			",409,94,13,48,23,9,33

												Rocket League is football/soccer done right. In FIFA you'll see every year they add new ""features"" that they think adds value to the game. In reality those features do nothing but take you further from what you want, just football.In rocket league the aim is to get the ball in the opponents goal more times than they can get it in your goal in a set amount of time. You can use flips and rocket boosting to get the ball in the goal and stop it going in yours. And that's the game. It may sound minimal and in reality it is, but because its so minimal it means getting into the game is incredibly easy. But mastering these mechanics will take forever.Every single game is different as everyone is better at something or pefer a certain playstyle. Unlike fifa where you're worrying about the multiple other ""features"" screwing you over, in rocket league it really is just some people in cars with a ball. And that's why this game is great. The ONE negative about this game is the servers. The reason the servers have been taking a dump on themselves is because of the immense amount of people trying to get on, now its only around 10k people on pc. But ps4 players who paid for ps+ got this for free this month so they've had 100k+ people trying to get on. This was a massive underestimate from the developers and I personally think it screwed up their launch immensley. However it seems to be running ok now so lets hope they've got it under control.With the correct attitude from the developers this game could become one of the most popular sports games on pc. People thinking this would become a big esports game aren't thinking straight. It's a game based entirely around the physics of a ball. It may become as big as FIFA's pro scene but thats a mere scratch on what esports really is.I rate the game 10/10 as it does what it does in a fantastic way. ",123,22,7,14,22,1,25

I have also translated my review into Dutch, please read second half for thatENGLISHIntroductionAt first, I was a bit sceptical. How could this game even be a good one?I had seen the trailers, I had seen about everything about this game.But still I thought that a game like this wouldn't be any success.A friend of mine recently bought the game and is enthusiastic about it.He also said that this would definatly be a game which I would love to play.And here is my review...The Game itselfThe game itself has a pretty simple concept, mixed together: racing and soccer.Basicly the player controls a car (kind of RC like to me) and you play soccer with it.You can play against AI bots with different levels of difficulty, but you can also play in local co-op mode or online.This game even has cross platform gaming, which means the players can connect to a game from multiple platforms.The platforms currently supported are Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and - obviously - the PC.The Menu within the gameThe game within the menu works quite nice and looks great.There are no options I'd miss and everything you can think of you would want to set, are adjustable.The Game mechanicsJust like every game - espcially in games like these - there's a curve to get to know the game.The curve in this game isn't that hard and - even in online games - you can get to score quite fast.Also the mechanics just feel right, I never got a feeling, that when something happened, it happend wrongly in any thinkable way.The excitement one gets after scoring, is just amazing, even when the opponent team scores, well, at least for me, hahaha. While I am writing this review, my throat hurts because of all the yelling. To make that even worse,the possibility to destroy opponent vehicles (when you've got enough velocity to just ram the opponent also makes me yell out of excitement, especially when you prevent the opponent (team) from scoring with it or when you can make sure to score with it (for example in front of the opponent's goal, when your team has the ball and are close to scoring).The controlsI played this game using my X360 controller connected to my PC. The controls are quite easy to learn, hard to master,so you can get to scoring even faster. I honestly have to say I did not play any second using the keyboard, so I can't tell anything about playing with the keyboard. Even the menu is available with the controller, so that's a nice thing, because not every game has support for it. How other controllers are doing with the PC version, is unknown to me, as I only do own a X360 controller.I do hope and think that newer controller, like the XONE controller or the new Steam controller are even better,because I hear that these controllers are more  comfortable while using.GraphicsThe graphics are nice, which doesn't come as a surprise, because the Unreal Engine is being used.By the looks of it, my guess is that the new Unreal Engine 3 (UE3) engine has been used.An older engine, but when you're in-game, you don't actually see it's UE3 being used, the game just looks to great for that.ConclusionTo my total surprise this game is very amusing and I actually am now recommending this game to anyone who thinks of buying this game. It's not that expensive, but the excitement pays back very well and quite fast.If you're a lover for arcade racing and fancy a soccer game (or the other way around) as well, then maybe this is something you will actually come to love. Even I didn't regret buying this game and I hope others won't as well.ScoreTo get a impression about how I feel about this game, I'd rate it a a 9 out of 10.NEDERLANDSIntroductieIk was eerst wat skeptisch over dit spel. Want hoe kan een spel als dit nou ooit een goed spel worden?Ik had wat trailers gezien en eigenlijk zo'n beetje alles wel, wat over dit spel te vinden was.Maar ondanks dat, dacht ik dat dit spel geen succes kon worden.Een vriend van mij heeft onlangs dit spel gekocht en was er best enthousiast over.Ook vertelde hij, dat hij wel vond dat dit een typische game voor mij zou zijn.En nu is hier mijn review...Het spelHet spel zelf is gebaseerd op simpele concepten, die samenkomen: racen en voetbal.Simpel gezegd bestuurd de speler een auto (wat doet denken aan een afstandbestuurbare auto) waarmee je voetbalt.Hierbij kan er tegen bots gespeeld worden op verschillende niveau's, maar je kunt ook online spelen en zelfs met lokale split-screen.Het spel kent zelfs crossplatform gaming, waarmee spelers van verschillende platformen het tegen elkaar kunnen opnemen.Het spel is momenteel speelbaar op de Xbox One, PlayStation 4 en - uiteraard - de PC.Het menuHet menu in het spel ziet er modern uit en past in de style van het spel.Ik heb niet het gevoel dat ik opties mis, eigenlijk alles wat je je kan bedenken, kun je instellen.De game mechanicsNet als elk spel, heeft ook dit spel een curve, je moet er dus even in komen.Die curve is niet al te moeilijk en je kunt eigenlijk vrij snel al punten scoren voor het team of een ander ervan weerhouden.Ook voelen de mechanics goed aan, ikzelf had althans nooit het gevoel, dat dingen die gebeurden fout gingen op wat voor manier dan ook.De opwinding die je krijgt van het scoren is gewoonweg fantastisch, ook als je een doelpunt tegen te verduren hebt, dat had ik tenminste wel, hahaha!Tijdens het schrijven van deze review, had ik nog steeds last van mijn keel, van al dat schreeuwen, hahaha! En om het nog erger te maken...In het spel is er ook een mogelijkheid om een tegenstander aan gort te rijden, door met de juiste snelheid er tegenaan te rijden.Als je hiermee het scoren van de tegenstander kan voorkomen of als je zelf vervolgens scoort, dan De besturingIkzelf heb dit spel gespeeld met Xbox 360 gamepad. De besturing zelf, is overigens niet erg moeilijk, maar beheersen kan even duren in combinatie met de mechanics.Eenmaal alles onder de knie, zul je zien dat je snel kan en zal scoren. Ik moet hierbij wel bekennen dat ik niet met toetsenbord heb gespeeld nog, ik kan dus geen oordeel geven over hoe het spel speelt met toetsenbord.Wel vond ik het erg fijn om met de gamepad ook het menu te kunnen besturen in het spel, je hoeft in feite dus niet steeds te schakelen. Hoe andere gamepads werken in combinatie met dit spel, heb ik dus ook niet kunnen testen, want ik heb alleen een Xbox 360 gamepad.Wel verwacht ik, dat het met gamepads als die van de Xbox One en de Steam gamepad het net even wat beter gaat, omdat die controllers wat comfortabeler in de hand liggen.De graphicsDe graphics zien er goed uit, maar dat is eigenlijk geen verassing, aangezien de Unreal Engine gebruikt wordt.Het lijkt er trouwens wel op, dat de gebruikte engine Unreal Engine 3 is.Een wat oudere engine dus, maar wanneer je in het spel zit of het speelt, merk je dat eigenlijk niet eens.ConclusieTot mijn verbazing moet ik toegeven dat dit spel een verassing is om te spelen. Ik had niet verwacht zoveel plezier te hebben in Rocket League.Mocht je dus nog over deze game twijfelen, dan zou ik zeker aanraden het spel te kopen.Het spel is niet duur en je krijgt er een heleboel plezier van.Als je van arcade racing en voetbal houdt, dan is dit misschien wel een spel om verliefd op te worden... ;)Je zult - net als ik - geen spijt krijgen dat je de game gekocht hebt.Het eindoordeelOm een cijfer te geven aan dit spel, zou ik het een 9 geven, op een schaal van 10.

												Trying to explain just how fun this game is to people is pretty much impossible. I have tried and usually just get a ""deer in headlights"" stare of bewilderment.You could explain the mechanics; you play as a rocket powered RC car capable of jumping and flipping around the field, trying to score goals while flying acrobatically through the air... but that doesn't quite capture the pure excitement that Rocket League offers.Not since Hawken have I experienced Overtime this intense and victories this satisfying and I honestly don't know why that is... but it is.Negative points are few and far between but some may be: servers aren't quite capable of handling the thousands of people playing at once but the devs say they are working on it, and it has improved in the last few days. Another might be that the ""random"" unlocks are for any car but the one you prefer to use but that's just PD2 ""random"" logic I'm already used too.Overall, this game runs great; I get between 40 and 60+ fps on my upper-middle-class PC. It looks great even with all the AA's and motion blur turn on its not over the top. The controls work and feel great even for keyboard and mouse unlike some OTHER games... *cough* Speedrunners. It is absolutely worth $20 and I have nothing else to say.			",97,9,3,4,11,2,0

												Awesome game. It's action-packed fun, while it takes lots of time to master. You'll play the same game, but as you get better, it will be a different experience almost always. Customizable cars giving options for lots including antennas and hats really lets you express your gaming with style. If you like csgo, rocket league has the same competitive feel, while games are short and quick. Recommend 100%!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Trying to explain just how fun this game is to people is pretty much impossible. I have tried and usually just get a ""deer in headlights"" stare of bewilderment.You could explain the mechanics; you play as a rocket powered RC car capable of jumping and flipping around the field, trying to score goals while flying acrobatically through the air... but that doesn't quite capture the pure excitement that Rocket League offers.Not since Hawken have I experienced Overtime this intense and victories this satisfying and I honestly don't know why that is... but it is.Negative points are few and far between but some may be: servers aren't quite capable of handling the thousands of people playing at once but the devs say they are working on it, and it has improved in the last few days. Another might be that the ""random"" unlocks are for any car but the one you prefer to use but that's just PD2 ""random"" logic I'm already used too.Overall, this game runs great; I get between 40 and 60+ fps on my upper-middle-class PC. It looks great even with all the AA's and motion blur turn on its not over the top. The controls work and feel great even for keyboard and mouse unlike some OTHER games... *cough* Speedrunners. It is absolutely worth $20 and I have nothing else to say.			",97,9,3,4,11,2,0

												Rocket League is football/soccer done right. In FIFA you'll see every year they add new ""features"" that they think adds value to the game. In reality those features do nothing but take you further from what you want, just football.In rocket league the aim is to get the ball in the opponents goal more times than they can get it in your goal in a set amount of time. You can use flips and rocket boosting to get the ball in the goal and stop it going in yours. And that's the game. It may sound minimal and in reality it is, but because its so minimal it means getting into the game is incredibly easy. But mastering these mechanics will take forever.Every single game is different as everyone is better at something or pefer a certain playstyle. Unlike fifa where you're worrying about the multiple other ""features"" screwing you over, in rocket league it really is just some people in cars with a ball. And that's why this game is great. The ONE negative about this game is the servers. The reason the servers have been taking a dump on themselves is because of the immense amount of people trying to get on, now its only around 10k people on pc. But ps4 players who paid for ps+ got this for free this month so they've had 100k+ people trying to get on. This was a massive underestimate from the developers and I personally think it screwed up their launch immensley. However it seems to be running ok now so lets hope they've got it under control.With the correct attitude from the developers this game could become one of the most popular sports games on pc. People thinking this would become a big esports game aren't thinking straight. It's a game based entirely around the physics of a ball. It may become as big as FIFA's pro scene but thats a mere scratch on what esports really is.I rate the game 10/10 as it does what it does in a fantastic way. ",123,22,7,14,22,1,25

I have also translated my review into Dutch, please read second half for thatENGLISHIntroductionAt first, I was a bit sceptical. How could this game even be a good one?I had seen the trailers, I had seen about everything about this game.But still I thought that a game like this wouldn't be any success.A friend of mine recently bought the game and is enthusiastic about it.He also said that this would definatly be a game which I would love to play.And here is my review...The Game itselfThe game itself has a pretty simple concept, mixed together: racing and soccer.Basicly the player controls a car (kind of RC like to me) and you play soccer with it.You can play against AI bots with different levels of difficulty, but you can also play in local co-op mode or online.This game even has cross platform gaming, which means the players can connect to a game from multiple platforms.The platforms currently supported are Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and - obviously - the PC.The Menu within the gameThe game within the menu works quite nice and looks great.There are no options I'd miss and everything you can think of you would want to set, are adjustable.The Game mechanicsJust like every game - espcially in games like these - there's a curve to get to know the game.The curve in this game isn't that hard and - even in online games - you can get to score quite fast.Also the mechanics just feel right, I never got a feeling, that when something happened, it happend wrongly in any thinkable way.The excitement one gets after scoring, is just amazing, even when the opponent team scores, well, at least for me, hahaha. While I am writing this review, my throat hurts because of all the yelling. To make that even worse,the possibility to destroy opponent vehicles (when you've got enough velocity to just ram the opponent also makes me yell out of excitement, especially when you prevent the opponent (team) from scoring with it or when you can make sure to score with it (for example in front of the opponent's goal, when your team has the ball and are close to scoring).The controlsI played this game using my X360 controller connected to my PC. The controls are quite easy to learn, hard to master,so you can get to scoring even faster. I honestly have to say I did not play any second using the keyboard, so I can't tell anything about playing with the keyboard. Even the menu is available with the controller, so that's a nice thing, because not every game has support for it. How other controllers are doing with the PC version, is unknown to me, as I only do own a X360 controller.I do hope and think that newer controller, like the XONE controller or the new Steam controller are even better,because I hear that these controllers are more  comfortable while using.GraphicsThe graphics are nice, which doesn't come as a surprise, because the Unreal Engine is being used.By the looks of it, my guess is that the new Unreal Engine 3 (UE3) engine has been used.An older engine, but when you're in-game, you don't actually see it's UE3 being used, the game just looks to great for that.ConclusionTo my total surprise this game is very amusing and I actually am now recommending this game to anyone who thinks of buying this game. It's not that expensive, but the excitement pays back very well and quite fast.If you're a lover for arcade racing and fancy a soccer game (or the other way around) as well, then maybe this is something you will actually come to love. Even I didn't regret buying this game and I hope others won't as well.ScoreTo get a impression about how I feel about this game, I'd rate it a a 9 out of 10.NEDERLANDSIntroductieIk was eerst wat skeptisch over dit spel. Want hoe kan een spel als dit nou ooit een goed spel worden?Ik had wat trailers gezien en eigenlijk zo'n beetje alles wel, wat over dit spel te vinden was.Maar ondanks dat, dacht ik dat dit spel geen succes kon worden.Een vriend van mij heeft onlangs dit spel gekocht en was er best enthousiast over.Ook vertelde hij, dat hij wel vond dat dit een typische game voor mij zou zijn.En nu is hier mijn review...Het spelHet spel zelf is gebaseerd op simpele concepten, die samenkomen: racen en voetbal.Simpel gezegd bestuurd de speler een auto (wat doet denken aan een afstandbestuurbare auto) waarmee je voetbalt.Hierbij kan er tegen bots gespeeld worden op verschillende niveau's, maar je kunt ook online spelen en zelfs met lokale split-screen.Het spel kent zelfs crossplatform gaming, waarmee spelers van verschillende platformen het tegen elkaar kunnen opnemen.Het spel is momenteel speelbaar op de Xbox One, PlayStation 4 en - uiteraard - de PC.Het menuHet menu in het spel ziet er modern uit en past in de style van het spel.Ik heb niet het gevoel dat ik opties mis, eigenlijk alles wat je je kan bedenken, kun je instellen.De game mechanicsNet als elk spel, heeft ook dit spel een curve, je moet er dus even in komen.Die curve is niet al te moeilijk en je kunt eigenlijk vrij snel al punten scoren voor het team of een ander ervan weerhouden.Ook voelen de mechanics goed aan, ikzelf had althans nooit het gevoel, dat dingen die gebeurden fout gingen op wat voor manier dan ook.De opwinding die je krijgt van het scoren is gewoonweg fantastisch, ook als je een doelpunt tegen te verduren hebt, dat had ik tenminste wel, hahaha!Tijdens het schrijven van deze review, had ik nog steeds last van mijn keel, van al dat schreeuwen, hahaha! En om het nog erger te maken...In het spel is er ook een mogelijkheid om een tegenstander aan gort te rijden, door met de juiste snelheid er tegenaan te rijden.Als je hiermee het scoren van de tegenstander kan voorkomen of als je zelf vervolgens scoort, dan De besturingIkzelf heb dit spel gespeeld met Xbox 360 gamepad. De besturing zelf, is overigens niet erg moeilijk, maar beheersen kan even duren in combinatie met de mechanics.Eenmaal alles onder de knie, zul je zien dat je snel kan en zal scoren. Ik moet hierbij wel bekennen dat ik niet met toetsenbord heb gespeeld nog, ik kan dus geen oordeel geven over hoe het spel speelt met toetsenbord.Wel vond ik het erg fijn om met de gamepad ook het menu te kunnen besturen in het spel, je hoeft in feite dus niet steeds te schakelen. Hoe andere gamepads werken in combinatie met dit spel, heb ik dus ook niet kunnen testen, want ik heb alleen een Xbox 360 gamepad.Wel verwacht ik, dat het met gamepads als die van de Xbox One en de Steam gamepad het net even wat beter gaat, omdat die controllers wat comfortabeler in de hand liggen.De graphicsDe graphics zien er goed uit, maar dat is eigenlijk geen verassing, aangezien de Unreal Engine gebruikt wordt.Het lijkt er trouwens wel op, dat de gebruikte engine Unreal Engine 3 is.Een wat oudere engine dus, maar wanneer je in het spel zit of het speelt, merk je dat eigenlijk niet eens.ConclusieTot mijn verbazing moet ik toegeven dat dit spel een verassing is om te spelen. Ik had niet verwacht zoveel plezier te hebben in Rocket League.Mocht je dus nog over deze game twijfelen, dan zou ik zeker aanraden het spel te kopen.Het spel is niet duur en je krijgt er een heleboel plezier van.Als je van arcade racing en voetbal houdt, dan is dit misschien wel een spel om verliefd op te worden... ;)Je zult - net als ik - geen spijt krijgen dat je de game gekocht hebt.Het eindoordeelOm een cijfer te geven aan dit spel, zou ik het een 9 geven, op een schaal van 10.

Rocket League is so easy to pick up it's hard to put downWhen my buddy asked me if I was going to buy Rocket League I said: ""Nah dude, I'm not so much of a soccer fan."". He told me he doesn't like soccer a lot either, he also told me that this game was nothing like normal soccer.So I bought it. That might be one of my best purchases of 2015, the game is extremely well-balanced and super fun to play. The graphics, physics, music etc it is just perfect. Rocket League is a physics-based vehicle soccer video game for Windows and PS4. The concept is easy: ""You have to use futuristic cars to knock a ball into the opponents goal"", you can jump into the air and use boosts to make this process easier.Pros:  Any non-acient PC can handle the game. If you want to check if you can handle the game, go to ""canyourunit.com"".[www.systemrequirementslab.com] Fun to play alone or with friends. Different skill opponents based on your own skill so it is impossible to lose all the time. A game only takes 5 minutes without overtime. The game is easy to learn, low skillcap. Multiple gamemodes make sure you will never get bored. Online mode against other players or offline mode against bots for training. Rocket League is not pay to win, the DLC's only contain extra cars and customizations. Your car choice or customization does not effect your gameplay in any way. It is possible to carry bad teammates. Gaining skill is fairly easy, you will not have to play 8 hours a day to win a match. You can mute other players. There is no way to cheat in this game which makes it more fun for every user. The sound is not annoying at all! There is a lot of physics in the game.Cons: You can't kick an AFK teammate, it will get a lot harder for you to win a match. The game does not have a report system for spam or griefing. The game is meant to be played with a controller, some movements are unable to do with a keyboard. It is possible to get in the higher ranks with a keyboard but it is way harder, therefor I would recommend a controller. The ranking system is still in it's beginning phase, it is fairly easy to rank up or rank down fast. You will need the DLC packs to get all the achievements.Overall experience:I would recommend this game to everyone, whether you're young or old, like FPS games or MMO RPG'S. Once you get the hang of it it is really fun to play. It is however more fun to play with friends then to play alone.It is super fun ingame with all the different cars and customizations. For just 20€ I consider this one of the best valued games on the Steam market. Originally posted by www.polygon.com:Rocket League is so easy to pick up it's hard to put down.This quote is exactly how you should picture this game.NOTE: I do recommend using a controller instead of keyboard.Rating: I would rate Rocket League a solid 9/10.Want more recommendations?

												One of my favorite games. I could not stop playing it or thinking about it for about the first 30 hours of playing it. I mean, not the first 30 hours after buying it. For a few weeks, I was hooked on it until about the 30-hour mark. Then it becomes frustrating to play with random people who suck because now you're good enough to know how to play and, who knows exactly wtf they're doing. BUT, if you have a friend to play with, it's amazing fun and that doesn't matter.Best played with a controller. You can buy a fairly cheap Logitech one online or at a Best Buy or whatever. I immediately bought a $10 Logitech F310 at Best Buy when I got this game. It's so much better. But it is playable with mouse and keyboard as well.ROCKET BOOSTSSUPER ACROBATIC BATTLE CARS1v1, 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4!I find it's best played on 2v2 with a friend as your teammate. 4v4 is pure chaos. Seriously. They even named it ""Chaos.""And, guess what. Don't like soccer? Don't like race cars? Neither did I. But sometimes when you combine 2 things you don't like, they can make something really awesome that you love. **ROCKET LEAGUE!**			",67,6,1,6,1,0,2

												Rocket League is a game which combines soccer and reckless driving. It is a sequel to the game SARPBC, Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars and it is produced by Psyonix. It includes cross-platform play between PS4 and PC, having an huge playerbase currently.GameplayYou will have lots of fun with this game guaranteed! The controls are ultra-simple to use, you will get used to them in a blink of an eye. I play the game with a controller, which for me it is the best way to play it, but it is enjoyable to play with the keyboard + mouse too. The game itself is ultra fun! The ball physics with the rebounds and all feel impressively well, as the cars handling. It is incredibly easy to play, yet extremely difficult to master. You also have to use strategy in this game in order to win the matches, much like regular soccer. If you are just a ball chaser you will have difficult times winning, you have to think about your positioning and timing very well. You can also do incredible trick shots and jump shots due to your boost, which are incredible hard to master, but after some time you will start to get the hang of it. The worst part are some camera angles and the bots AI, but unless you plan on only playing offline games, the AI wont be much of a problem. It feels so good to make some incredible plays, even when you fail you will have tons of laughs. It is a very simple game with simple ideas, yet they work perfectly and make this game a blast to play for both casual and professional players.LongevityThe longevity of a game which relies on an multiplayer-focused game can be debatable, but in this one I am sure you will spend enough hours to compensate the money you spend in the game. At the moment I have spent 35 hours and intend to spend many more. You have tons of cars, paint jobs, hats and other customization stuff to unlock during the game that will keep you entertained for the first hours (I unlocked everything in around 20 hours). You also have 4 different game-modes (1vs1, 2vs2, 3vs3, 4vs4) which give some good diversity since each one of the modes has its own strategies to follow in order to win them. You also have an offline season mode available to play, but it is kind of boring in my opinion given the multiplayer options you have. Practice mode is also available, a great place to tune your skills up. The ranks and leaderboards system will also entertain you, it is great to climb up against your friends in the diverse list of leaderboards available.Graphics and PresentationOnly have good things to say here too. By the moment you enter the game you will know you are in for something special. Slick menus with an ultra easy interface plus amazing songs will make you excited right at the first time you open the game. You got plenty of voice commands to use in-game which is definitely a plus presentation wise. Now the graphics. Another win in this spectacular game. Great graphics for a game this simple. All works really well, the colors, grass, car details, everything looks great. The level of detail in the cars and their customization objects is great too. These are some impressive visuals, even though the main focus of the game is definitely not the graphics.Music and SoundsThe soundtrack in this game is amazing. I was totally not expecting it, there are really some great songs in it, got some of them stuck in my head. There are only around eleven songs in it, but most are awesome and don't get old. The various sounds in the game are also great, from the sounds of the different boost types, ball hits, drifts, crashes, everything works really well.MultiplayerThis is the big deal in this game. And oh boy, how fun it is to play it with or against friends. You will have tons of fun making the best goals ever as well as the biggest fails in history. It really gives you tons of laughs. You have also the option to play ranked instead of casual games, which make for some more intense, fun matches! The playerbase is huge, around 100000 players are online in most of the time, so you will find games in a matter of seconds. The community is in it´s majority very friendly, but like in all multiplayer games, you will find some toxic people playing the game too. You also have different server regions to choose from so you can play without worrying about lag. Unfortunately I did have some crazy lags in some european servers. It is rare to find a laggy server but it happens and can get very frustrating, specially when you are playing ranked. Yet, I am sure the devs will fix most of the server issues soon, so no worries about that.SummaryPros:Newcomer-friendly gameplay, yet difficult to masterGreat controlsAmazing soundtrackGreat graphics and presentationAmazing multiplayer with lots of fast-paced, intense matchesCons:The Bots AI is pretty weakSome connection issues in multiplayerMy personal score: 9.7/10If you enjoy high octane reckless driving and the world's most popular sport, Rocket League is for you. It is one of the most fun multiplayer games released in the last years. The base price is great value for the game you get, which will get you hours and hours of great fun! Embrace the latest gaming trend in Steam and PS4 and have a blast playing this soccer-meets-cars gem! ",209,71,12,24,17,3,33

												Other reviews covered positive sides pretty good, I'm just gonna say a single minus- there's no real punishments for leaving ranked. It's almost impossible to play ranked 3's because of constant leavers, people failing to connect, etc. One of my matches (3v3 queue) started 1v2! That shouldn't happen at all! It's still a positive review, this game is too good and developers showed much response to community already, they'll probably fix that too.EDIT. Patch 1.0.4 Ranked matches will no longer start if the game is not full.See, I told you :P			",358,86,13,55,62,5,71

												When I first fired this game up, I didn't know what to expect. The controls took some getting used to, but once you get them down, there's something magic about this game. I spent the next 4 hours holding my controller, unable to wipe the grin off my face, and finally realised that this is what gaming is about. This game is pure FUN. It's competative, but you can laugh about how horrible you look when you whiffed on that save, you feel happy even if you lost, you're having a blast. I can feel the addiction starting to settle in, because I cannot stop hitting next match. Just one more match, just one more match, like in the old days. I haven't enjoyed myself so much since the Genesis era. Now I have to get more friends in on this game.			",226,31,21,31,25,5,34

The only downside that i saw was that there is some lag issues, although I did find that if you changed the region from ""any"" to whatever region you live in, it helps with the lag.

												 Rocket League is a physics-based vehicle soccer video game developed and published by Psyonix.Well who are fifa fans (like me) will love this game for sure...the mechanics of the game are outstanding....the cross play with ps4 players will pump the show....there are no special rules...simply we are a car trying to put the ball in the net and rock the show.....                 my personal likes from this is the finiishing touches  just like  in real fifa forwards dribble pasts defenders and finish ...just like we rush with our jet speed car and boom we on target.....and we score....some touches in air are simply mindblowing...    There are so many cars which we can upgrade with various paint job,custom decal paint jobs,flags,and other various stuffs     this is not a hardcore game or not like that....but it be ur time stelaer for sure....want fun?....just get this and start playing  #Sales:Rocket league as of december 2015- [8] million copies have been sold....and this figure will be increasing soon.even though 2015 is dominated by huge AAA titles on the line....rocket league is one of the best games of the year for sure...Awards:best sports/racing game of 2015....Cptn personal review:well i love this game and want this series to be continued ....as  a fifa fan i love this product.....its more awsome with the recent dlcs out ....thats it thanks for reading my review urs _CPTN.......100%recommended....

												Hit a ball a couple times, into the goal they goOnce more, twice more, three more times.suddenly you're a proThen when you think the game is won you sit back with a smileLittle did you know the other team was ready for this trial.They hit it once and in it goes faster then beforeYou don't know whats happening but suddenly they score.They keep on scoring in quick persission snappier then the last.You spam ""Nice shot"" as much as you can, but deep down u wanna kick their♥♥♥♥♥The score is locked an even number, ""3 to 3"" it reads.You sit back in utter shock, as your nose begins to bleed.You take a few to gather your thoughts and think about this crime.BUT DON'T YOU FRET THE GAME IS NOT OVER, THERE STILL IS OVER TIME.The countdown hits ""1"" and off you fly, your team on your left and right.""TOGETHER WE SHAL DEFEAT THEM!"" is what blasts through your micThe other team was in total shock they did not see this coming,They spent most of the over time, sitting in the back and hummingThe ball goes flying in beautiful precision headed right for that goal.It pierces the barrier and colors fly!Making you lose controlThe final score reads ""4 to 3"" a perfect little sightI can't explain how happy you feel, its just the perfect night.

												Game was fun, this last patch has destroyed the competitive mode. Its randomly throws people in it. They have forced bad maps into the competitive matches and its just ruined the spirit of it all.They have changed the POV settings and the speeds are off somewhat as it was during Seasons 1 and 2.

												Let me get right to it. Rocket League is an amazingly addictive game with a lot of depth. Just when you thought you know how to play, other higher-level players will come and shatter that illusion. It also feels amazing seeing players pull off amazing moves, and then after several matches you try looking badass, failing each time, until it does work, and you get progressively better at it. It's a textbook ""easy to learn, hard to master"" kinda game in that regard. The controls are responsive, and it also looks amazing visually at max settings. But... why a negative review then? Hear me out, don't down-thumb like a sheep because I don't ""like it"". Because I do. I love Rocket League, my play time is proof of that. Then what is it? On the surface it's very simple, but deep beneath it's a very troubling issue: Psyonix has announced a crate system á la Counter Strike: Global Offensive and Team Fortress 2. And as far as I'm concerned it's literally the worst timing to implement such a controversial system, with the recent outcry regarding the CSGOLotto-gate and the two little sh*ts Martin and Syndicate, as well as Valve's involvement in all this (going as far as ""advising and consulting"" these shady websites). Psyonix was - and to a certain extent still is - a developer that I hold highly because of their pro-consumer attitude with a lot of effort put into free post-launch content. To keep affording their contributions, they already sold DLC with new cars and other cosmetic items, but I didn't mind. Why didn't I mind? Because you already knew what you'd buy, it's not a surprise. You can spend the 2$ on a DLC pack and know exactly what you'll get. But with this new upcoming system, it's literally going to be a lottery. And I know what you're thinking, ""lol he uses the word literally wrong"". No, I mean it. It's literally a lottery. To make matters worse, while regular gambling is regulated at a minimum age of 18, even children can play Rocket League. Crates will be dropped ""free"" randomly during regular gameplay, but you can only open that crate if you buy a key. Which essentially means it's literally gambling: you never know what's in a crate unless you spend the money on a key to open it. Maybe it's a great and rare item, maybe it's a duplicate you already have dozens of. And to top it all off, you won't even be able to sell your items on the Steam Community Market. ""We don't want it to make prone to exploitations"", they say. But that's bullcrap, it's only because of the console versions that they won't - or can't - implement a selling system. So what happens when you've spent money on this lottery only to have many duplicates? Who knows, probably you could just use the current trading menu with five items of a certain class that convert to one item of a higher class.This is not just about you. This is also not just about disabling the crate system and just playing the game as we used to. This is about a morally grey system that can take advantage of vulnerable people for uncreative, greedy financial benefit. And I don't want to take part in this, and neither should you. But I expect thumbs down and ignorant comments.			",222,44,2,27,7,1,28

												I'm going to do a very simple Pros and Cons Review of this game. TL:DR; 10/10, have never played a game that causes me to scream in agony, facepalm at the sheer stupidity of what I just did, and have a giant grin on my face laughing with friends all in the matter of 5 minutes.PROS-100's of cool and unique customations for your vehicles, including hats, and antennaes (There are also some popular gaming communities flags included in the game to show off your love for Lirik or RoosterTeeth etc.)-Besides marginal differences and a slight variation in hitboxes all vehicles handle the same, allowing you to pick your car based on preference of look and not based on which is ""op""-The game play can be summed up as ""easy to learn, difficult to master""-There are many maps with more free maps and whacky new game modes to be added.-The camera has multiple sliders to allow you to tinker with the camera until its exactly how you like-Seamless switching between controller and keyboard-Runs at a smooth 60FPS-Split-screen-1v1,2v2,3v3,and 4v4 game modes-DLC has no in-game advantages hidden behind a pay-wall, they are strictly cosmetic and only for if you'd like to help out the devs(Not to mention the first DLC is a reference to Fast and Furious)-Tons of options, very in-depth video, sound, and interface options that any PC gamer will be content with.-Very nice and easy to use Quick-Chat in game to quickly tell your teammates when you are defending or going for the ball during kick-off, as well as spam NICE-SHOT when an enemy accidentally own goals.-Ranked system has a very basic elo system, start at 0 pts, go through Bronze, Silver, Gold, Etc. Nice and simple, win more than you lose and you will advance.-Season system against bots that's great for when you just want to sit back and relax without the worry of competitive matchmaking.(It is to be noted that EXP earned is halved when playing bot games)CONS-Cross-Platform without the option to disable. This is honestly my biggest issue with the game. There is a ""disable cross-play"" option in the game however it only functions in ranked, forcing me to play unranked with ps4 users on my team. Call me a PC elitist or whatever you'd like, but in my 44 hours of experience at the time of writing, 95% of afkers and leavers, as well as people with ping above 100 are ps4 players(spotted by the PSY Net profile picture) I would be willing to wait up to 5 times my normal wait times if it means I wont have someone leave or rubber band around the map at 900 ping.-ZERO penalty for leaving games. In Unranked you are free to join and leave games whenever you want, as often as you want, with no repurcussions. losing by 2? Screw it just leave. Have to pee? Just leave the game.-No option to disable joining in progress. Because there are no repurccussions for leaving games, you tend to join games in progress where your team is losing 7-0, luckily you can just leave without worry ;), but constantly leaving games I join with 30 seconds left down by 5+ pts get's annoying and has happened way more than I feel it should for how much I've played.-No Ranked Team-Play. You can join ranked games with your friends, but there is no ability to create a ranked team, and play with a roster of people. With the custom colors already implemented in the seasons mode it would be very easy to allow us to create teams, with a normal paint job and alternate in case the other team matches us, as well as pick our favorite map as home field, playing ranked 3v3's with my friends and our own custom colored cars and logos (also already implemented in seasons) would be fantastic. Less of a con and more of something that really should be put into the gameRECAP-I highly recommend this game, as it has clearly made it's way to the upper part of my playtime list and shows no sign of stopping. It's a game you can pick-up and just relax if you'd like but at the same time it's a game that can have you at the edge of your seat, butt clenched screaming at the top of your lungs as you score a goal with 0 seconds left to tie the game and put it into overtime, only to have the other team score at kick-off.

												This has been some of the most fun I've had playing an online game in a very long time. It's a game you really have to play, and feel, in order to truly understand the hype. This is a game I honestly think almost anyone can enjoy. Even if you're not typically a fan of sports games, like myself, or don't particularly like cars or racing, I still feel like there's a ton of enjoyment to be had with Rocket League. It's a game that is even more fun to play than it looks.Every match creates an impressive sense of tension that makes each goal, assist, cross, clear or save feel extremely satisfying. The tight and responsive controls only add to this, as nearly every play or mistake simply comes down to your ability and timing. The controls are intuitive enough to pick up quickly but with an immense amount of depth. You can easily spend hundreds of hours honing your skills and still have room to improve. There's a huge skill cap and the gap between players can be extremely obvious. Thankfully, even the unranked matchmaking has MMR, so you generally always get matched against players of equal skill.It looks as though things will only keep get better with the seasons and ranked divisions. There's currently ranked 1v1, team ranked 2v2, and solo ranked 3v3. They will be adding more in the near future including a team ranked 3v3 (Woo!). There's a lot of potential here for some amazing competitve gameplay and I can't wait to see it.There's already a ton of stuff to unlock in-game as you level up; everything from new vehicles to a very large variety of ways to customize them, as well as some hidden secrets. You unlock things almost every game, so you always have something to look forward to. The devs want to support the game for years and will be adding more content to the game as time goes on. Some of it will be paid addons with new cars, ways to customize, etc., but every future map will be free to all.TL;DR I can think of few better ways to spend $20 if you're looking for a really fun game that you can sink a ton of time into. This game makes me feel like a kid again, and I love it.I have high hopes for this game! I will continue to update this review as I play more.			",201,9,2,13,9,0,13

												Rocket League is pretty cool, I guess.Set in a post apocalyptic future where prisoners are forced to play soccer in highly explosive motor vehicles, where the loss of life and blood shed is used to sate the anger of an ever growing complacent society. Rocket League puts you in the shoes of one of these vehicles as you do your best to try and put that stupid god damn ball into the stupid god damn net if only your god damn team would stop charging at the god damn ball like you're part of a god damn peewee soccer team.God damn. Never has a game made me feel as inadequate as Rocket League, it's like living in a box while Tommy Two Tooth lives in a relatively clean dumpster. I want that dumpster, Tommy. The game can be played with anything from two to eight people, who's objective is to hit the giant ball into the giant net. This is easier said than done half the time since you have 6 or 8 people charging into the ball with the hope of it somehow finding the net. I mean, I'm guilty of this two, but I have the excuse of being ripped on MDMA for most of my life. Sounds simple, right? Well, it is, but it also mixes in a few other elements. Not only does your car move fairly fast, but it also comes with a turbo feature so you can haphazardly drive up the wall and fly off the ceiling. You can also double jump to reach a high flying ball and miss completely. One of the more advanced techniques is to use the turbo boost mid air so you can fly of sorts and miss the  ball while it's still in the air. My favorite feature is hitting the ball and having it accidentally fly into my own net, having my friends laugh and yell at me while I wonder why I'm sober. Haha, just kidding. I don't have friends. Missile Franchise however has one major advantage. And that's how easy it is to pick up. You can go weeks, if not months of not playing and still be fairly awful as you were while you still played. It's hard to take a game like Rocket League seriously and that's probably it's strongest point, mixing in both casual and hardcore players and showing that we're both equally garbage. Should you play Rocket League?I say you should, it's fun, fast, and frantic, it's great to play with others, and it also lets you destroy little kids to the point that they make high pitch noises and Pikachu sounds for the rest of the game until they quit.Seriously, I'm not joking, we did that once, we broke him.

												Addictive and fun (with friends splitscreen or online), Rocket League achieves the oldest and most important adage in gaming, ""easy to pick up, difficult to master"".I surely played thousands of hours of the original game (this is a sequel to a PSN title) and I took part in both the Alpha and Beta stages of development of Rocket League, but there is still much for me to master and strive for. There is a compelling reason to buy this game to play with friends on or offline but online is where it truely shines, you can be as casual or competitive as you like.Rocket League is not a game, it's a way of life. Just try it, you won't be disappointed. Controller recommended.			",681,224,32,82,55,8,76

												Rocket League is a crazy blend of soccer (or football depending on where you live) and RC cars.The basic idea of the game is very basic - use your car to poke the ball into opponent's gates.You'd think this might be awkward with RC cars physics, but that's actually not the case. From my point of view, this game has some of the most polished and balanced ""fun physics"" model I'd seen lately. You have pretty much absolute control over your car and it's movements (well, aside from times when you are flying). Which means that it's quite easy to control the ball (if you are not terrible as I am).In addition to basic RC car controls you have an ability to (double) jump and boost (which can also be used to propel yourself to the sky).You can also use your car to push other cars away from the ball. And if you have enough speed - you can blow enemies up (can be achieved by using boost boost).There are also some cosmetic customizations, different car bodies, tires and stuff like this.So, it all comes down to the question - does poking the ball and high speeds towards gates sounds compelling to you? If yes - grab this game, it's pretty awesome. If not - well, it's not for you, go get something you'll enjoy.I have to also note that I'm not exactly a huge fan of soccer. But I had an absolute blast playing Rocket League.Oh, and there's also split-screen support.I have not noticed any issues or problems with the game during my playtime.More detailed look in the video:

												Rocket League is one of my favorite games ever released. The depth that the game involves is absolutely incredible. But, the game has major flaws that ""patches"" have ""addressed"". The biggest one being the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor ranking system in the ranked game modes. You win 3 games, still same division, you lose 1, down a division. This attempt at a ranking system is so god awful that it makes me and everyone i have ever discussed it with want to jump off of a bridge. And yet the devs release this huge patch claiming to fix everything by resetting everyone, when really all the patch was, minor fixes and then covering up the flaws with new items and personlization ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. gg psyonix.

												I absolutly love this game. FLipping rocket cars playing soccar is so much fun. The new rumble update is one of the most fun games I have ever played. I Sadly cannot recommend Rocket league because of an unwelcome part of the rumble update. Previously all cosmetic DLC was the fair price 0f $2-4. In the rumble update they have added TF2 style crates you must unlock with keys. You cannot recieve the crate items in random drops. Car skins from crates have already skyrocketed to $15 worth of keys if you want to trade with other players. What would have been $2 if sold by Psyonix as one car, is now $15 unless you open a crate and the rng gives you the car you want (You could easily spend more then $15 opening crates and reciving nothing you want). Even if you were the luckiest person ever and recived every single item in both of the current crates for 1 key each, it would cost $30: Significantly more then the most expensive DLC you can purchase for the game, which is the soundtrack Vol. 2 at $6.As long as this anti-consumer system is in the game I refuse to purchase any Psyonix products. I would have purchased the new cosmettics as a DLC pack, even if it cost more then all of the other DLC.			",115,9,2,10,20,0,8

												You know that feeling you get when you watch your favorite sports team and they do something amazing (score a point/goal, whatever), well, Rocket League is that feeling, guarenteed, every evening you play it. You will be amazed after many hours how the skill curve is still there and that improvement comes with it. You'll be amazed even with your own performance from week to week, and it will keep you hungry for more. It's not even a scary game to pick up for beginners because you get placed against similar levels/skillsets. It's the casual and competitive gamers' place of unification, under a generally cool concept with strong execution from the developers. This has been my go-to game since the summer '15 and it will likely continue to be a staple for a while to come. I'd recommend to anyone. $21 is cheap. Do yourself a favor and buy RL.

												I've got to say, for a multiplayer game, the matchmaking takes the fun right out of it.  If you start winning, they place you against players multiple levels above you, thus keeping you from progressing and to a certain degree it sucks the fun right out of it. I've played it for all seasons now and the way winning streaks are handled now just ruins the fun of the game (to me). I don't want to grind again hellaciously difficult players because I had the audacity to win twice. I really, really like this game, but it feels like the fun has been taken out of it. It's just a chore now.			",1189,407,33,153,106,12,197

												I would recommend this game, but there's a lot of annoying things that come with it. The Community.Oh the community in this game. Have you ever played CSGO? Yeah, it's like that but from what I've experienced it's worse.You'll get called out for being a crappier teammate quicker and more frequently, even though what counts to having a good teammate is yourself. I mean this by the fact that Doubles more-so than Standard is like marriage; it either works, or it doesn't. You can't simply have 2 people playing in the exact same way, otherwise you won't accomplish anything. But you'll get called out on it because your teammate is nothing other than a sore loser. It's nobodies fault that you were paired with someone who has the same playstyle and isn't compatible when it comes to Doubles. Kidding, it's your fault, YOU suck, YOU are the problem. (Sarcasm, if you missed it).The DevelopersI wish the developers put as much work into the game when it comes to dealing with the community, rather than focusing it on more DLC and maps that nobody truely asked for. Sure, some of the maps are good, but when a lot of them suck it's not helped by the fact you're limited to a preference-based system which seems more like a placebo effect. The DLC isn't anything special, the cars are just from other games they pair up with to make DLC in the game and the most annoying difference is that the other game who makes the DLC on Rocket League usually supplies their DLC for free.Though, I don't mind, I wouldn't be using the DLC anyway. The only point to DLC that I see is to support the developers, but I can't support the developers in such a way when they can't fix the simple things instead of the half-arsed features that deal with disruptive players.The report feature is good (not really), but for what good it does I might as well just not bother playing if I'm looking to enjoy the game which is hard to do when you're put with people that come across as if they grief regularly. The bans are pretty lax, which is a shame because a lot of players that do cause problems are the ones that pick up and play for 20 minutes at a time maybe, then come back 1-2 days later giving plenty of time for a ban to wear off. There's no real reason to care about being banned for griefing in this game. Hell, I've griefed a few times to put it to the test, but I've never seen a ban come from it.Ranked feels simplistic and, again, half-arsed. Sure, it may function, but it's hardly anything special. Matches still seem to go off a hidden point system, for example; you win, you rank up but the next match you lose you rank down. So here's the problem, at a lot of ranks you can experience the same skill level of players, and that doesn't work so well when you're trying to rank up to what 'should' be considered a good rank. See in CSGO, MGE or DMG is about the average. You can feel the difference to being Nova 2 as opposed to DMG, but in Rocket League Prospect 3 is pretty much the same as Challenger 3, only you can use that 'rank' to stroke your ego when insulting your teammates and such. Conclusion, some whatAll in all, I can't recommend this game. It's not fun anymore and it's dragged down mostly by the community, and the features needed for it to be fun are non-existant even after almost 2 years of it's release.Eventually I'd like to see that bans aren't as lax and the ranked system is better along with the report system. It was good for the first 2 seasons, but it seems the developers couldn't keep up with the increase in players and more so the toxic ones. Hopefully all the money earned from eSports and the DLC will go towards improving the issues aforementioned.			",309,26,12,24,38,3,12

												Not sure what it is about this game. Whenever you talk about it to people they're always asking ""well doesn't it get boring? It's just the same thing over and over"" and you can understand why they think that.But there's some beauty when it comes to the game. It's almost like its simplicity is its strength, with this environment where you can apparently only do one thing, you're able to do almost anything. It's almost got a sandbox feel to it, always competing but trying out new things, and I can safely say that after 1000 hours there's still so much to learn.Price wise is fantastic, and if you've got the funds available I can't recommend it above, don't be overwhelmed when you can't do what you want at the start, just give the game the couple of hundred hours it deserves and evaluate your situation then.

												Rocket League is easily one of my favorite multiplayer games. Everything runs completely smooth, I haven't run into a single glitch or lag spike, there's no voice chat (that i know of) which is good because, while I would like to communicate with my team, there's no telling whether they would listen or whether an 11 year old would tell me what my mother's been doing. Every goal made rewards you with an extremely satisfying explosion it leaves me wanting more. But not from the developers, I just can't stop playing xDMy only complaint is I would like more levels, which I'm assuming levels will be added or switched out over time.  A new game mode would be nice too. Like and Anti Gravity mode where you have unlimited boost and have to fly around for the ball. But I'm just nitpicking.This is an absolutely amazing game and you would be wasting your money if you spent it anywhere else but here.			",270,58,6,25,30,1,14

												Hands down, one of the best games of 2015.  Similar in action to another Indie game called Altitude (ball mode) where teams try to score goals against the opposing team.  However, instead of cars Altitude uses planes. Rocket League will be a game I play for years to come - controls are easy to learn, but hard to master.  There's nothing more exhilarating than skillfully flying your rocket car through the air to score a sick shot against the opposing team!  What a rush!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let’s not waste energy exploring why soccer should replace its paper chain of squalid billionaires with cars, and accept it as fact. A fact which Rocket League proves with simple and immediate ease.I’ve never played a game that needed a tutorial less. Association football, soccer, wendyball; whatever you want to call it, it’s that, but on wheels. Drive car at giant ball; hit ball into net; score points. Rocket League’s competitive core has existed for centuries, and this helps make a preposterous concept feel primal. This, in turn, is a laughable way of describing a game which would be called moto carball if it actually existed.Like dry martinis and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥scribbled in an unattended notebooks, Rocket League is a celebration of simplicity. Driving is delicious. Cars ease around like butter in a heated pan, but always feel under your control. You accumulate boost by driving over markers on the arena floor and unleash it is a thunderous rush that fires you across, over and around the pitch. Because matches take place in smooth, enclosed spaces, you can drive up walls and across ceilings. Cars can also jump and dodge, both of which can be used defensively and offensively. The weight of the cars, as well as your ability to apply unruly boost to jumps, adds a pleasingly haphazard element; like athletic footballers leaping to header high balls, but with less shirt-pulling and zero chance of flattening a £2000 hairdo.Cars ease around like butter in a heated pan, but always feel under your control.Vehicles feel light and buzzy—somewhere between Micro Machines, and those swift, slidey remote controlled cars which only seem to appear on Christmas Day. This contrasts nicely with the fat, beefy bounce of the ball, which gormlessly invites impact like a punchable cousin. And that’s it. I feel almost guilty reducing a review to ‘ball’ and ‘car’, but there are only ever those two things in the field of play, and crucially, they both feel great. It’s helped by a crisp, intuitive camera. You can focus on the ball, effortlessly whizzing around with it always in view, or switch to the standard camera - very useful for rushing back to defend your goal, or smashing into other vehicles. There are no weapons, but certain markers fill your boost and let you obliterate other players. Mercifully, it’s the generous, instantly-respawning type of obliteration. Destruction is the only conspicuous deviation from clean business of driving around and scoring goals, but in most of the games I played it was a rarity—certainly never frequent enough to be irritating.Destroying other vehicles is one of many actions which accumulates points; imagine Burnout, but with awards for skill not speed. You receive points for things like clearing the ball from your goal line, spectacular saves and overhead bicycle kicks—named so because the more literal ‘quadracycle wheel-nudge’ is a senseless stew of words. Giving everything a points value means it’s about more than scoring goals. The most valuable players I encountered were workmanlike wingers who selflessly chugged along the the flanks, crossing the ball for greedy goalhunters like me. It stops players from clustering in the same spots and reinforces the concept that Rocket League is a team game.Except, of course, when it’s not, such as when you’re duelling against a single opponent. Alternatively, you can set teams of four against each other, in matches which become so frantic that they’re less like footy, more like a lost, confused beach ball bashed between bumper cars. Playlists of duels, doubles, standard 3v3 matches and the appropriately named Chaos 4v4 mode are all available online, with ranked playlists limited to duels, doubles and 3v3. There’s a reason why online play is the first option on the menu: Rocket League is designed to be played with actual people, and this is absolutely where it thrives. My experience was marvellously robust. I rarely had to wait long for a game, and if players dropped out mid-session they were immediately replaced by AI bots. Best of all, it’s refreshingly simple to get back into another game, so very little time is spent lingering in lobbies.If playing online isn’t your thing, there are exhibition matches and full seasons you can solo. The length and difficulty can be altered, and while it doesn’t offer much in the way of depth—cars and football, remember?—I still found myself bonding with pretend teammates. Whether online or offline, playing games randomly unlocks new cars and upgrades. These range from simple things like fresh coats of paint and shiny wheels, to pointy hats for your wizardmobile. Upgrades are purely cosmetic, but volume, variety and the promise of driving around with bubbles frothing from your exhaust should be enough to keep you coming back.The offline modes do reveal the game’s minor inadequacies, however: team AI can be flaccid and unreliable, especially against tougher opponents, and the same simplicity which makes Rocket League immediately playable can cause things to get repetitive when played alone; a criticism that only becomes apparent precisely because it’s so damn addictive. It’s a simple thing done brilliantly well, kept interesting by the thrill of competition.THE VERDICT 87/100ROCKET LEAGUERocket League is fast, fun and relentlessly enjoyable. The best football game without feet.			",189,44,1,46,12,1,12

												Rocket League is easily one of my favorite multiplayer games. Everything runs completely smooth, I haven't run into a single glitch or lag spike, there's no voice chat (that i know of) which is good because, while I would like to communicate with my team, there's no telling whether they would listen or whether an 11 year old would tell me what my mother's been doing. Every goal made rewards you with an extremely satisfying explosion it leaves me wanting more. But not from the developers, I just can't stop playing xDMy only complaint is I would like more levels, which I'm assuming levels will be added or switched out over time.  A new game mode would be nice too. Like and Anti Gravity mode where you have unlimited boost and have to fly around for the ball. But I'm just nitpicking.This is an absolutely amazing game and you would be wasting your money if you spent it anywhere else but here.			",270,58,6,25,30,1,14

												tldr: Ridiculous fun. Simple to pick up and difficult to master. HIGHLY recommended.My reviewInitially I was so confused about all the hype this game had; it seriously looked stupid to me. Cars with a soccer ball? ""Okay whatever I guess"" I thought ""I'm not even a fan of car games or soccer"". Even watching the videos that YouTubers made I wasn't convinced that this game was worth its asking price. However, I made one purchase that changed all that...I preordered the Steam Link because I needed a device like that at my house, and there was a promotional combo going on for those that preordered it; you'll get a copy of Portal 2 and Rocket League for free. I decided that since I was getting the game for free I would download it and give a try. I thought I would just run it once or twice and then leave it to gather dust in my 200+ games library. Oh man was I wrong.The first match I ever played online was so much fun. I found myself laughing rather then getting frustrated when me and my teammate would both drive past the ball, turn around using a three point turn and then accidentally smacking the ball into our own goal. I knew how to jump and flip from the tutorial but the only thing I seemed to do was mash the accelerate trigger. Despite my poor understanding of the games mechanics I managed to squeeze in a winning goal... for the enemy team. We lost the match 2-0.And you know what? Instead of getting angry I just queued up another match. And another. And another. Next thing I know I've been playing four hours without even thinking about it. It was just so much fun to be able to learn from your mistakes and apply your new knowledge so quickly. I quickly learned when to use boost, when to jump, when to flip, and I just kept getting better and better at the game. Now, I'm not a pro by any means, I'm not even at the 'Champion' rank yet, but I've sure as hell come a long way, and I only keep improving with each game I play. Gameplay wise this is without a doubt the best game I've ever played in a long long time. The rules are as follows:  Get the ball into the enemy goalAnd that's it. It's such a simple objective and yet there's so many ways to go about it. Do you try to get it over their heads? How about a simple pass? Do you boost into and demolish the goalie so your partner has an open net? Or when you get even better at the game, you can just fly into the air and gracefully tap it into the goal.The cars handle like a dream. They do EXACTLY what you want them to do. Once you master the use of a controller with this game you can virtually pull off any move you can think of: your car will never get in the way. This helps reduce frustration by a lot.In terms of graphics the devs make full use of UE4, meaning the game is stunning even for such a simple concept. The maps along with their skyboxes are rich in detail. The grass sways in the wind, and the sand have track marks from the cars driving over them. It's a really good looking game that is also super well optomized: any modern GPU can handle this game @1080p with 60fps.Overall, this is my favorite indie game of 2015 (and probably 2016 too), and I saw it's a must buy for anyone with a Steam account.

This game quickly became my most played game on Steam, surpassing games that I have owned for years like TF2 and Civ 5.

												Lots of fun from the first second - Starting out as a pretty chaotic game of hitting the ball as hard as possible in roughly the right direction, Rocket League changes as you do, quickly becoming a fast paced and very tactical game as you anticipate the balls (and other players) movement in an effort to land strong, accurate shots. Easy to get into, but with enough depth to provide a lot to learn and a lot of fun playtime. Only downside is that if, like me, you find it easy to get angry at losing, or playing badly, this game will drive (hah!) you crazy at times.10/10 overall.			",61,1,1,10,13,0,13

												Rocket league is an incredible game, that definitly deserves a spot in your game library. The concept is original, the gameplay is a blast, the controls are designed with finess. There really isn't much to complain about with this time soaker of a game. The graphics are impressive, the community is thriving and encouraging, and the experience of ranking up and learning how to meneuver your car in new ways as the hours go by is highly engaging and rewarding. There are both competitive and casual que's to satisfy a larger audience, and new updates being released constantly. This game is polished like you would not believe, and is my personal favourite multiplayer experience. You will not regret buying this game, and I promise you will get more than a few hours of great fun within its glory.			",25,5,0,3,2,0,1

												I've been looking forward to playing Rocket League for a while.  Thanks to the free weekend I was able to put enough time into it in order to judge it properly.  The matches can become quite intense and the fact that there's both bots and splitscreen mean that you can have a decent amount of fun with your friends.  I can see this game being great fun even if it ever gets to the point where there are only a few people playing it online.			",764,221,41,136,96,3,131

												Lots of fun from the first second - Starting out as a pretty chaotic game of hitting the ball as hard as possible in roughly the right direction, Rocket League changes as you do, quickly becoming a fast paced and very tactical game as you anticipate the balls (and other players) movement in an effort to land strong, accurate shots. Easy to get into, but with enough depth to provide a lot to learn and a lot of fun playtime. Only downside is that if, like me, you find it easy to get angry at losing, or playing badly, this game will drive (hah!) you crazy at times.10/10 overall.			",61,1,1,10,13,0,13

												Hands down, one of the best games of 2015.  Similar in action to another Indie game called Altitude (ball mode) where teams try to score goals against the opposing team.  However, instead of cars Altitude uses planes. Rocket League will be a game I play for years to come - controls are easy to learn, but hard to master.  There's nothing more exhilarating than skillfully flying your rocket car through the air to score a sick shot against the opposing team!  What a rush!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's nice to see a game without any big expectation & turning into a little hype! Nothing special about this game, it's plain cars play soccer/football in stadiums. Yet, the gameplay is awesome, the laughters moments are so often. You can play season/exhibition match while waiting for an online matchmaking. The sound is sometimes a little rusty, but overall with a great music  - awesome experience. Furthermore, you'll have tons of cars, items and style option to your cars!Right now, after a day it worked fine there is a little problem with the servers. It should be fixed soon & matchmaking servers will work as they did before. Over 70K people waiting for you to crash your car in there while trying to score. You'd probably see many fluke goals(Which are funny). HIghly recommended game with friends or without :)			",41,9,0,5,7,1,9

												A great competitive but easy to get into game with amazing depth of play and replayability. I was on the edge about purchasing this game, especially at full price. The only reason that I took the plunge was because Steam recently released their refund system, so I wasn't worried about making a poor purchase. I played the tutorial at first and I already knew I was hooked. The increadibly gratifying feeling of scoring my first goal. I still remember that. And while that feeling may have dulled to a degree, it likes to come back in amazing games. A lot of reviews seem to mention the community and that if you don't have a friend that plays this game you might as well pass it on. Well this is not entirely true.  I have made a great many friends playing this game. Simply go into a duel and once you have a good game with someone ask if they want to team up. I have made a dozen friends this way and I can always get someone to play with within a few games. The only real negative in my opinion is that the framerate is locked to 60fps. There are however .ini tweaks to remove this cap, although some people report problems with it, I haven't experienced any. I get a smooth 150fps with two 780s playing on ultra at 1440p. On a final note, Ultra Low Motion Blur (also known as Light Boost), works amazingly for this game. I've owned a monitor capable of ULMB for over a year now and played with it a few times, but it is incredibly apparent for this game and I would say helps me as well.			",189,27,4,21,19,1,41

It's also the section of the plant that contains the seeds. The other parts of plants are considered vegetables. These include the stems, leaves and roots — and even the flower bud.This game teaches you life lessons. 10/10 Would buy for a friend.			",158,16,8,18,12,2,23

												I know this game doesn't really need the praise but as I don't often write reviews and when I do they're always for games I feel should never of been added in the first place I feel like it's a nice change to be able to write about a game as fresh as Rocket League is.I'll start off by saying I was in the beta for RL but I never knew how much fun I would get out of it playing with friends, it was enjoyable back then playing alone but it's so much fun playing with friends.The more people recommend this game and the bigger the game will get I think, I'm a big FPS gamer and I've played cs for most of the time I've owned a PC and I'm massively into eSports, any game with potential of that and I'm straight into looking into it, I've played most of the FPS Games out there, BF, CoD and even got into MOBAs. I mean it might already have some smaller leagues but I'm hoping this might be another game to take off into the world of eSports. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys that side of gaming or someone would just likes something to play while you feel in the mood for a change of pace, and also the casual PC gamer who just plays anything you're able to get your hands on. I can only imagine it's already got people buying it from all the big streamers playing it like LIRIK, summit, Soda and the rest.Going back to the game I feel like the devs have done an amazing job with this game, the gameplay is solid, it's enjoyable for short term gameplay or hours of gameplay and it's cheap for a game in todays world where anything on Steam can cost up to £50 but you could say it's not a type A title, Gameplay is mostly easy, the basics are easy to lock down but when you attempt to learn the timings for rocket boosters, jumping off walls and other things you could spend days, weeks or maybe even months attempting to get them to a system you feel is reasonable.The game has a decent setup for people, the FOV can be changed aswell as camera angles.. The only thing that annoys me personally is I use the talk button on my controller for mumble but everytime I set the button seems to reset so I have to keep doing the same change everytime I boot the game back up, I suppose there is a simple fix for it out there, I've read editing files or making the config read only is a temp fix.In terms of how the game plays? Very smooth, I'm sadly one of the AMD gfx card owners and while some games are just poorly optimized for my card this is good. Controller support is also good and I recommend using one to play.Overall this game is one of my favourites this year at just £15. People thinking of waiting for the sale if you have money to spare I would just buy it now, I honestly don't think you'll regret buying this game, I'm one of those people who normally wait and I was going too but the amount of gameplay I kept seeing on Twitch, I just decided just to buy it anyways and I'm glad I did.

												I am 30, baby on the way, generally feeling my age creeping up. Worked a full day, drove the 5 hours to spend a long weekend with my brother. We fired this up at 11:30 PM to see what all the hype was about. By 10AM the following day I had logged 6 hours of playtime. I have not fought the urge to get a good nights sleep to play a game in years. I am sure as time passes like most games the community will become toxic and unkind to players lacking the finesse or decision making to make a team excel, but at the moment this is one of the most refreshing and enjoyable gaming experiences in recent memory. I hope this encourages at least 1, but hopefully thousands of purchases of this gem.			",221,42,4,40,10,2,28

												Edit: It's been well over a year and a lot has changed with Rocket League. I've put in over 400 hours now and it's easy to say that you never stop learning of new things to do. That's the magic of this game. If you have the drive to become better, you have that opportunity. Every game is a fresh pallette for your to learn from. Engaging in aerials and challenging the ground play is commonplace for even ""fresh"" under 100 hour players now. It's remarkable how the community has grown. The basis of the game itself is the player base. You can focus on the inevitable sketchy personalities there are, or you can play and find those worth spending your cooperative playtime with. I've always been interested in learning from others and it's been great playing with 30+ good teammates along the way. If you're the type that wants to push yourself and get better personally, this game is absolutely for you. The ball physics do become more predictable and make sense as you pay attention and see the trends. Player personalities do show through and your study of the behaviors does matter. The game is far from surface-deep. Original post Jul 17, 2015:  This game transports me back to the feeling of all the great old-school sports games. I remember yelling at my friends every time the game winning shot went and we whined over the indefinite ball physics. That isn't to say that this game isn't polished. It has a nice energetic electronic soundtrack and it doesn't try to inject excessive personality. The elements it has are well done. Some examples... -Graphics: not too cartoony, not overly gritty. -Venues: although little variance, lots of ambient and lighting differences keeps things fresh.-Customization: Make your car your own with a rich color pallette and some neat effects.Bought this at regular price, it is totally worth it! Looking forward to dozens, maybe hundreds of hours in this one.			",189,32,8,22,21,1,28

												It's actually not more than a fast paced game of soccer with rocket powered cars, but that's all it takes to make you never stop playing. Key factors are the very smooth controls and probably the best learning experience any game can offer: In the first few hours you pretty much drive across the field desperately trying to hit the ball. And you fail ... Hard ....... Many, MANY times, but you laugh at your fails and at all the other players' fails too. After a while you can get decent shots with the ball and you start to take the game more seriously. But what makes you really angry are the guys that can shoot from up in the air, which you think is very unfair. So now you also want to become one of those flying monsters and you're going to have a really hard time trying to hit those aerials until you can finally wreck your opponents. Did I say finally? Well, No Way! Now it is all about actually shooting the air balls on target from right underneath the ceiling and off the walls and stuff... Uh, are we still not the biggest pro in the world now? The answer is a big fat NO! There are still many more things to learn pushing your skill to maximum and beyond ... and on ... and on .... and even further.This experience is also pushed by a pretty good matchmaking system that (almost) always puts you into challenging matchups no matter what skill level you are at.Rocket League really is a great game and if you consider to buy it, just go for it - a decision you won't regret. While being a little sceptic about the initial hype with nearly every streamer or youtuber playing the game, I have to admit what Psyonix delivers to us here justifies all attention and excitement about the game.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When I first seen this game I am not going to lie I thought it was just another ""fad"" and this game would quickly die out so I ignored it. Boy was I wrong. This is in all ways a great game. First off, it's really easy to get into. No crazy rules or anything to memorize, its just one of those games that is easy to pick up but hard to master. Optimization for this game is STELLAR. I was personally expecting my build to run it terribly as it runs most other games pretty bad but I was happily surprised to find this game to run smooth as butter. There are also a ton of customization options, a decent amount to start off with and more are unlocked through playing matches. Controls feel fluid and ""right"". What I mean by that is a lot of games these days the controls just feel off and ehh. I was playing with a PS4 controller and it works flawlessly and the controls are great although the default sensitivity I found to be a bit low so I had to adjust that. My main problem I have with this game is the matchmaking system. Honestly it's not great as beginners will be paired up with pros which is a pain so expect your first few hours in the game to be an absolute wreck. Another thing I have to say I don't like about this game it would be the maps. Don't get me wrong they are all really pretty but all the maps are essentially just different backgrounds of the same pill shaped stadium. It would be cool if different maps had certain features to them that made them for unique (like ramps in different parts of the maps). Other than that this is definitely a must buy, i'm really sad I hadn't tried this out sooner.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I know this game doesn't really need the praise but as I don't often write reviews and when I do they're always for games I feel should never of been added in the first place I feel like it's a nice change to be able to write about a game as fresh as Rocket League is.I'll start off by saying I was in the beta for RL but I never knew how much fun I would get out of it playing with friends, it was enjoyable back then playing alone but it's so much fun playing with friends.The more people recommend this game and the bigger the game will get I think, I'm a big FPS gamer and I've played cs for most of the time I've owned a PC and I'm massively into eSports, any game with potential of that and I'm straight into looking into it, I've played most of the FPS Games out there, BF, CoD and even got into MOBAs. I mean it might already have some smaller leagues but I'm hoping this might be another game to take off into the world of eSports. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys that side of gaming or someone would just likes something to play while you feel in the mood for a change of pace, and also the casual PC gamer who just plays anything you're able to get your hands on. I can only imagine it's already got people buying it from all the big streamers playing it like LIRIK, summit, Soda and the rest.Going back to the game I feel like the devs have done an amazing job with this game, the gameplay is solid, it's enjoyable for short term gameplay or hours of gameplay and it's cheap for a game in todays world where anything on Steam can cost up to £50 but you could say it's not a type A title, Gameplay is mostly easy, the basics are easy to lock down but when you attempt to learn the timings for rocket boosters, jumping off walls and other things you could spend days, weeks or maybe even months attempting to get them to a system you feel is reasonable.The game has a decent setup for people, the FOV can be changed aswell as camera angles.. The only thing that annoys me personally is I use the talk button on my controller for mumble but everytime I set the button seems to reset so I have to keep doing the same change everytime I boot the game back up, I suppose there is a simple fix for it out there, I've read editing files or making the config read only is a temp fix.In terms of how the game plays? Very smooth, I'm sadly one of the AMD gfx card owners and while some games are just poorly optimized for my card this is good. Controller support is also good and I recommend using one to play.Overall this game is one of my favourites this year at just £15. People thinking of waiting for the sale if you have money to spare I would just buy it now, I honestly don't think you'll regret buying this game, I'm one of those people who normally wait and I was going too but the amount of gameplay I kept seeing on Twitch, I just decided just to buy it anyways and I'm glad I did.

												I love this game so much. It never bores me to play it.It's easy to learn but hard to master and is a really solid competetive game.I'm not the biggest fan of cars and football/soccer but both mixed together make it a game I just enjoy to play.Must have in my opinion. It takes a long time to get kind of good but it's definitely worth it in my opinion!			",111,12,4,8,10,2,15

												The first time I saw this game I knew I have to play it and I wasn't wrong this game. It's so good and so balance and hard to master that you will always  learn something new. Good amount of customization, just skins, nothing that can change the gameplay, plus the maps are free.You dont have to pay anything beside the game to play it and have fun, there is no advantage from other players with the dlc unlike other games... cough...payday2...cough. You dont have to like football nor cars to play this game. Go buy this game right now you won't regret it. ",291,53,9,28,15,1,31

												An amazing and fun game that you would not expect to captivate you for hours on end. Low price point and on the outside a one-trick pony, however for what it does, it goes above and beyond. A simple mechanic of cars with rocket boosters playing car-size football that will keep bringing you back. And to keep you in style and have some personality a myriad of cosmetic parts to customise your car out. All in all its stupid fun. 9/10.			",243,24,7,26,22,4,40

												I can't remember the last time I had this much fun in online games.. this, people.. is how you make a GOOD game.The things I'm really excited about (from the most important to less important): Amazing gameplay and absolute rocksolid programming (no crashes, glitches, stupid UI elements) Very good matchmaking (you'll be playing in seconds and after a couple of really big wins, you seem to get better oponents (could be just me)) Awesome soundtrack (I spent the first few minutes just listening to the soundtrack when I first started it :P) Great sound effects (good atmosphere, good programming/scripting.. lots of little details such as crowds chanting 'we want more' when you start a rematch) Great support for controllers Great menu system, easy to understand, good to read on TV Very good graphics, great 3D models, great texture design, great overal design Challenging tutorialsThe only downside to this game is that is can be highly addictive! Play with care and take breaks often.. your adrenal gland will thank you for it!			",169,37,5,19,55,4,46

												Rocket League is a project involving a secret partnership with Microsoft. Due to controller sales falling, Microsoft decided to make a game with the sole purpose of getting the saltiest players together to break them, and thus have to feed into the vicious cycle.

												Few things to start with:- I hate racing games- i don't like soccer games- i LOVE Rocket LeagueWhen you first see this game you might be like:""Soccer and cars? Oh, really? Cool idea, but this cannot be fun.""If you are afraid wasting your money (It's often on sales, 3rd party sites, buying game for cs;go/tf2 keys), then trust me:YOU WILL NOT REGRETIt's possible that you checked youtube videos for this game and have seen all those fancy aerials, sick dribbles and breathtaking freestyles. Well... Don't expect to be that good at the beginning. Don't be suprised when you have less than 15hrs... you will  rather miss the ball on ground than touch it xDBut... after spending more and more hours in this game you'll notice that you are slowly getting better and better. It's very satisfying. Just rly... When i was a pro (like 30-60hrs into the game [i dont remember how many hours it takes to get 20-29 lvl sry]) i did my first aerial goal  and i was like: ""AHHHHHH!!! IM SO GUT FEELSGOODMAN"" but then i checked some youtube videos and were like: ""Okay... FeelsBadMan"". This game is easy to play and hard to master and gives a lot of fun (as long as you dont meet salty kid [Ignore him/ mute him]). Try it out :)11/10. Spent +700 hrs  at the time of writing this review. Will play more :D			",172,29,2,19,15,2,17

												Gameplay is great.  Controls are tight.  There's stuff to unlock.  Easy to play but you can spend many hours mastering the game.  This is probably one of the top 10 best PC games made in the last 10 years.			",240,19,6,6,18,4,1

												tldr: Ridiculous fun. Simple to pick up and difficult to master. HIGHLY recommended.My reviewInitially I was so confused about all the hype this game had; it seriously looked stupid to me. Cars with a soccer ball? ""Okay whatever I guess"" I thought ""I'm not even a fan of car games or soccer"". Even watching the videos that YouTubers made I wasn't convinced that this game was worth its asking price. However, I made one purchase that changed all that...I preordered the Steam Link because I needed a device like that at my house, and there was a promotional combo going on for those that preordered it; you'll get a copy of Portal 2 and Rocket League for free. I decided that since I was getting the game for free I would download it and give a try. I thought I would just run it once or twice and then leave it to gather dust in my 200+ games library. Oh man was I wrong.The first match I ever played online was so much fun. I found myself laughing rather then getting frustrated when me and my teammate would both drive past the ball, turn around using a three point turn and then accidentally smacking the ball into our own goal. I knew how to jump and flip from the tutorial but the only thing I seemed to do was mash the accelerate trigger. Despite my poor understanding of the games mechanics I managed to squeeze in a winning goal... for the enemy team. We lost the match 2-0.And you know what? Instead of getting angry I just queued up another match. And another. And another. Next thing I know I've been playing four hours without even thinking about it. It was just so much fun to be able to learn from your mistakes and apply your new knowledge so quickly. I quickly learned when to use boost, when to jump, when to flip, and I just kept getting better and better at the game. Now, I'm not a pro by any means, I'm not even at the 'Champion' rank yet, but I've sure as hell come a long way, and I only keep improving with each game I play. Gameplay wise this is without a doubt the best game I've ever played in a long long time. The rules are as follows:  Get the ball into the enemy goalAnd that's it. It's such a simple objective and yet there's so many ways to go about it. Do you try to get it over their heads? How about a simple pass? Do you boost into and demolish the goalie so your partner has an open net? Or when you get even better at the game, you can just fly into the air and gracefully tap it into the goal.The cars handle like a dream. They do EXACTLY what you want them to do. Once you master the use of a controller with this game you can virtually pull off any move you can think of: your car will never get in the way. This helps reduce frustration by a lot.In terms of graphics the devs make full use of UE4, meaning the game is stunning even for such a simple concept. The maps along with their skyboxes are rich in detail. The grass sways in the wind, and the sand have track marks from the cars driving over them. It's a really good looking game that is also super well optomized: any modern GPU can handle this game @1080p with 60fps.Overall, this is my favorite indie game of 2015 (and probably 2016 too), and I saw it's a must buy for anyone with a Steam account.

												Not sure what it is about this game. Whenever you talk about it to people they're always asking ""well doesn't it get boring? It's just the same thing over and over"" and you can understand why they think that.But there's some beauty when it comes to the game. It's almost like its simplicity is its strength, with this environment where you can apparently only do one thing, you're able to do almost anything. It's almost got a sandbox feel to it, always competing but trying out new things, and I can safely say that after 1000 hours there's still so much to learn.Price wise is fantastic, and if you've got the funds available I can't recommend it above, don't be overwhelmed when you can't do what you want at the start, just give the game the couple of hundred hours it deserves and evaluate your situation then.

												This game is super fun and highly addicting. It takes the simple concept of soccer with cars and turns it into a game fun for both new players and highly skilled competitors. This game quickly became my most played game on Steam, surpassing games that I have owned for years like TF2 and Civ 5. The amount of fun I have had from this game is worth way more than the $20 it costs.11/10			",164,34,2,17,22,2,17

												To put it simply, this is probably the only sports game any gamer would ACTUALLY play. Thank goodness Steam doesn't put up with that Madden and FIFA♥♥♥♥♥♥every year, and all those other ones.Rocket League is a combination of soccer and cars [or vehicles capable of juggling a giant flashy ball around. Whatever]. The controls are simple enough any way you decide to play — I play with the Steam Controller personally, but again, any way you desire is absurdly easy and comfortable. It plays like a typical soccer game, too; trying to launch the giant ball into the opposing team's goals. And normally, a match is made up of six players—three on each team. There are options for 1V1 and 4 on 4, even, and you will be hard pressed to put this game down.Though I do have to say that online play tends to suffer quite a bit, especially when people with horrible ping/connection are in the game and driving everyone crazy with how they're clipping into the ground and flying in circles and all that. It gets a little frustrating.The customization isn't a huge turn on for me [never really is, as I don't care much for different costumes and the like], but I'd recommend, if you've been looking at this game for a short time, or even a while now, to get the Collector's Edition through retail. It comes with four of the newest car models, and three of the big DLC packs, which also give you more cars to play with, and more skins, 'toppers' and all sorts of zany decals for your vehicle of choice. It also comes with a really cool art print that was specially made to celebrate the game's retail release. And the Collector's Edition is still around $20 (prices obviously vary from where you look).Gosh, I miss my Hot Wheels collection from when I was super little :bSo hey, you can either wait for a sale on this game (it's normally $13.99) and still get a few new cars if you've got $20 to spend in the first place, or you can buy the game at retail (It'll always be the collector's edition, as that's all there is). And how ever you buy the game, it'll be pretty damn hard to put down.			",168,51,1,12,5,0,3

												So i heard everyone was buying this new trend thsat just hit the steam store and it's alot of fun, so decide to buy it, and i must say this is one of the most fun competitive games i have played, it's just a blazing amount of fun specially when you play it with a friend you can feel the teamwork work together and you can enjoy such a good moment when scoring that goal, like wow ♥♥♥♥ yeah i just did that, it's very easy to learn but very hard to master and be the best, since i have seen some unrealistic plays (in the ranked games) and i do not believe how good people can be at playing this game, anyway long story short.this is a game i needed to play when im bored from playing CSGO or whatever else it is you play primarely.i really do however hope of seeing some pretty cool updates, like maybe weapons in the game or other game mods like deathmatch, aerial flying race, or W/E, maybe the ability to upgrade your car to have a better performance (other than having them all the same) to make it more balanced so the van for example could be more armored but slower. EITHER WAY I GIVE THIS A - 9/10  - A.K.A worth every mother ♥♥♥♥ing penny			",79,3,0,4,5,0,1

												Very fun competitive multiplayer game, while on this game I pondered with someone on what makes a fruit a fruit and a vegetable a vegetable, this is what I came up with : According to botanists (those who study plants) a fruit is the part of the plant that develops from a flower. It's also the section of the plant that contains the seeds. The other parts of plants are considered vegetables. These include the stems, leaves and roots — and even the flower bud.This game teaches you life lessons. 10/10 Would buy for a friend.			",158,16,8,18,12,2,23

												A great competitive but easy to get into game with amazing depth of play and replayability. I was on the edge about purchasing this game, especially at full price. The only reason that I took the plunge was because Steam recently released their refund system, so I wasn't worried about making a poor purchase. I played the tutorial at first and I already knew I was hooked. The increadibly gratifying feeling of scoring my first goal. I still remember that. And while that feeling may have dulled to a degree, it likes to come back in amazing games. A lot of reviews seem to mention the community and that if you don't have a friend that plays this game you might as well pass it on. Well this is not entirely true.  I have made a great many friends playing this game. Simply go into a duel and once you have a good game with someone ask if they want to team up. I have made a dozen friends this way and I can always get someone to play with within a few games. The only real negative in my opinion is that the framerate is locked to 60fps. There are however .ini tweaks to remove this cap, although some people report problems with it, I haven't experienced any. I get a smooth 150fps with two 780s playing on ultra at 1440p. On a final note, Ultra Low Motion Blur (also known as Light Boost), works amazingly for this game. I've owned a monitor capable of ULMB for over a year now and played with it a few times, but it is incredibly apparent for this game and I would say helps me as well.			",189,27,4,21,19,1,41

												I know this game doesn't really need the praise but as I don't often write reviews and when I do they're always for games I feel should never of been added in the first place I feel like it's a nice change to be able to write about a game as fresh as Rocket League is.I'll start off by saying I was in the beta for RL but I never knew how much fun I would get out of it playing with friends, it was enjoyable back then playing alone but it's so much fun playing with friends.The more people recommend this game and the bigger the game will get I think, I'm a big FPS gamer and I've played cs for most of the time I've owned a PC and I'm massively into eSports, any game with potential of that and I'm straight into looking into it, I've played most of the FPS Games out there, BF, CoD and even got into MOBAs. I mean it might already have some smaller leagues but I'm hoping this might be another game to take off into the world of eSports. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys that side of gaming or someone would just likes something to play while you feel in the mood for a change of pace, and also the casual PC gamer who just plays anything you're able to get your hands on. I can only imagine it's already got people buying it from all the big streamers playing it like LIRIK, summit, Soda and the rest.Going back to the game I feel like the devs have done an amazing job with this game, the gameplay is solid, it's enjoyable for short term gameplay or hours of gameplay and it's cheap for a game in todays world where anything on Steam can cost up to £50 but you could say it's not a type A title, Gameplay is mostly easy, the basics are easy to lock down but when you attempt to learn the timings for rocket boosters, jumping off walls and other things you could spend days, weeks or maybe even months attempting to get them to a system you feel is reasonable.The game has a decent setup for people, the FOV can be changed aswell as camera angles.. The only thing that annoys me personally is I use the talk button on my controller for mumble but everytime I set the button seems to reset so I have to keep doing the same change everytime I boot the game back up, I suppose there is a simple fix for it out there, I've read editing files or making the config read only is a temp fix.In terms of how the game plays? Very smooth, I'm sadly one of the AMD gfx card owners and while some games are just poorly optimized for my card this is good. Controller support is also good and I recommend using one to play.Overall this game is one of my favourites this year at just £15. People thinking of waiting for the sale if you have money to spare I would just buy it now, I honestly don't think you'll regret buying this game, I'm one of those people who normally wait and I was going too but the amount of gameplay I kept seeing on Twitch, I just decided just to buy it anyways and I'm glad I did.

												Well, usually I'm not the biggest writer - actually I haven't written a review at all. But when a game lets me pass the mark of 1,000 playing hours, I think it well deservers my first one.Rocket League is a fascinating and exciting mixture of soccer, but with a special twist of not just being yet another simulation, but it introduced something else - flying cars. It is rather easy to start with, and in the beginning (and to be honest sometimes even now) you are happy when you hit the ball. Later on, when you've managed to advance through the game with your first goal (yeah!), your first aerial-goal (hell yeah!!) and nail-biting saves of balls that have crossed the line with 99% (holy s***!!!) you will realize: ""Hey, there are still guys out there that kick my a**!"" and that there is still much to learn.But your effort and endurance will be rewarded with a fun, thrilling and competitive game, which will let you keep saying ""just 5 more minutes""...But that's not all: Psyonix, the developer, is one of its kind. They do something, which is rare, maybe even extinct in the world of game developers and publishers: they listen to the community (crazy, right?)! So here we are, a good year after the release of Rocket League and Psyonix has released several small (optional!) DLCs which primarily introduced new cars and they have released free updates which introduced new maps and play modes. After ice hockey and basketball which altered the map setting and/or the ball the newest addition ""Rumble"" gave us a more fun oriented mode with all kinds of power-ups that will literally kick your and your opponents a**. These big additions were free, so if you want to, you can have an awesome game that'll entertain you for ages at a low-budget price. If you want to support this great bunch of people a bit more, you can buy the DLCs or some keys to the recently integrated crates. Both ways are not in any kind a ""pay2win"" upgrade, but either just new cars or some stuff to pimp the visuals of your car. So with Rocket League and its DLCs being on sale again right now, wait no longer, and buy this great piece of software - you will not regret it!			",47,2,10,6,8,2,17

												I've been looking forward to playing Rocket League for a while.  Thanks to the free weekend I was able to put enough time into it in order to judge it properly.  The matches can become quite intense and the fact that there's both bots and splitscreen mean that you can have a decent amount of fun with your friends.  I can see this game being great fun even if it ever gets to the point where there are only a few people playing it online.			",764,221,41,136,96,3,131

												This game is super fun and highly addicting. It takes the simple concept of soccer with cars and turns it into a game fun for both new players and highly skilled competitors. This game quickly became my most played game on Steam, surpassing games that I have owned for years like TF2 and Civ 5. The amount of fun I have had from this game is worth way more than the $20 it costs.11/10			",164,34,2,17,22,2,17

This is one of the best games I have played so far!Rocket League is probably the most unique game I have ever played that is so much fun without lacking a goal.  Pun intended.  You play as a little bumper car... and you try to play football (US: soccer). You use a rocket engine to boost ur speed and can even fly if you get skilled enough to handle the car in mid air. There is a lot to the game and it is hard to master but very much fun to play.  Game modes?   Solo - 1v1  Double - 2v2  Standard - 3v3  Chaos - 4v4  Ranked Solo - 1v1  Ranked Double - 2v2  Ranked Standard Solo - 3v3 (NO TEAM)  Ranked Standard - 3v3 (TEAMs)  Special Modes / Private Matches / Mutator SettingsSoloYou will play against another player.DoubleYou will play with a friend/random against two other players.StandardYou will play with two friends/randoms against three other players.ChaosYou will play with three friends/randoms against four other players.Ranked SoloThe same as Solo ""unranked"" basicly.DoubleThe same as Double ""unranked"" basicly.Standard SoloYou will play with two randoms against three random other players.StandardYou will play with two randoms/friends against three other players (possibly a Team).Special ModesThere are sometimes different modes you can play, like for example the hockey puk mode.Private Matches / Mutator SettingsIn private matches you can choose settings for the game and with the mutator settings you can also change the game itself for example unlimited boost, low gravity, ball speed, etc.Friendly Matches/Bots/SeasonYou can also play against bots... It is boring but an easy way to earn experience. Cars There are a lot of cars, and you can choose a lot of costumization options such as sticker/decals, colour, antenna, tires/rims, hat and the boost. It is very very colourful and the cars are very well designed. I hope I could help :)			",58,5,1,5,9,1,4

												Rocket league is an incredible game, that definitly deserves a spot in your game library. The concept is original, the gameplay is a blast, the controls are designed with finess. There really isn't much to complain about with this time soaker of a game. The graphics are impressive, the community is thriving and encouraging, and the experience of ranking up and learning how to meneuver your car in new ways as the hours go by is highly engaging and rewarding. There are both competitive and casual que's to satisfy a larger audience, and new updates being released constantly. This game is polished like you would not believe, and is my personal favourite multiplayer experience. You will not regret buying this game, and I promise you will get more than a few hours of great fun within its glory.			",25,5,0,3,2,0,1

Seriously amazing game. Nothing beats the anticipation of whether or not you'll hit that goal scoring, or saving, ball.

												It's a great game. One of them easy to play hard to master games. And it takes a fair while to master all of the games mechanics like physics and positioning.

												This game is easily one of my favourite games. This game has intense competitive multiplay, which I love, mixed with a playful casual side of the game, which is delivered through the gamemodes such as rumble and snowday. Recently the game has added a trading feature, with of course new items, from crates, to trade. This is a blessing and a curse, as I love to trade with other people and build my inventory, even so much so that I have started to pour money into buying keys, but it's helping our brilliant game devs who continue to support the vast and growing community the game has so it's worth it.

												Rocket League is a football game like none other. It is also a surprisingly deep game considering the mechanics are literally: go fast, slow down, (double) jump, slide and boost. There is a tonne of nuanced gameplay you won't get your head around until hours in to the game, with flying and juggling a few of the possibilities. With an incredibly well realised visual aesthetic and presentation that oozes class. It's money well spent even if you're just playing on-line alone. Though with a team, or a few friends round, it could easily eat hours of your night.While lacking game modes, the base game is enough to keep you distracted for some time.I can't recommend this game enough.

												Rocket league is a soccer game with cars that puts huge emphasis on the physics of the ball and car. Game is really easy to learn, but very hard to master. It develops hand to eye coordination, precision, timing, teamwork, split-second decisions and pretty much every other cognitive function. But, before anything else, it is FUN!

												Hi! I'm IGgy, you may remember me from avoiding pure multiplayer games like the plague that they are and I'm here to recommend Rocket League, a game that combines two things that I hate! Football (Soccer if you're weird) and pure multiplayer games! The reasons I can stand this football game is because instead of humans that crawl over the field at a sluggish pace while some old dude gives color commentary over it you have ♥♥♥♥ing rocket cars and you can put skulls onto them.This is my car at the moment of heroically throwing itself between the goal and the ball. And it has a skull painted on it you better ♥♥♥♥ing believe it. And yes that is a mother♥♥♥♥ing propeller hat on top of that car. I know this whole ""oooh, silly hats, haha. I get it!""-thing is really ♥♥♥♥ing played out but this ♥♥♥♥ing propeller spins. They patched that in because people were complaining that it doesn't spin. They also made it so all the explosions now spell BOOM! in big explodey letters.I got it for free with PS+ on PS4. I played a couple games and then decided this is worth the full price so I can play it on PC! I then got it on PC!!It has this easy to pick up, hard to master deal going for it. At first you'll just drive around maybe jump occasionally, while attempting to move the ball to where you want it to be until you've won that struggle that is winning your first match. After a short time you'll do some insane♥♥♥♥♥♥you think is super awesome and then you see someone who's actually good at the game and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ if what I did was awesome than this is at least Awesome with a capital A. Maybe even an A+. Then you'll crank up the FOV and zoom out the camera and you'll instantly be slightly closer to the skillz of those mastas.It even has cross-platform play in public and private matches. On the same platform you can just invite friends to form a party with you and then trash some pubbies that just pile up on the ball like it's the second coming of that piece of toast with some bearded dude's face on it. If you have twenty bucks to spare feel free to get that game and stuff.I mean, it's all right.			",353,57,3,33,21,1,32

												This game is a blast. It's a nutty concept, but the gameplay is so well polished that everything just feels right about it. It really is a genre of it's own. The learning curve isn't too steep, but there's lots of opportunity to continue improving your skills as you keep playing. But honestly, even when you're losing you're still having a good time.You won't regret picking this game up.			",211,38,3,20,14,1,26

												This is an awesome game, it's one of my favourites. The matches aren't heavily time consuming, so it's a great game to pick up and kill a few minutes. It also has a great competitive system if you are into ranking on games.Lastly, I highly reccomend a controller to be used. I played with keyboard and mouse for a long time and I could definately see the difference in performance once I started using an xbox 360 controller on my PC. It just makes the gameplay smoother.

												I love this game so much that I own it on every platform.It's incredibly fun for a game with such a simple formula. It's enjoyable if you have only 10 minutes of free time to play, or if you want to binge for hours; it never gets old. The developers are fantastic; really involved with the community, constantly updating the game with new requested features, and best of all, no pay-to-win microtransactions. Personally I'm completely fine with paying a couple of bucks for some new cars just as a way to support Psyonix. It's just really refreshing to see a genuinely fun game made by genuinely great developers, especially in the cesspool of microtransactions and cut-content that is the AAA game industry today.TL:DR -  Wow!Wow!Wow!Chat disabled for 1 seconds.

												As every multiplayer game, I recommend getting a friend or two to play it with you, you get used to the controls quickly, they're simple. The game is fun.I was a little worried about this game, cause I dislike football and racing games, this game is NOTHING like those two genres. Definitely would recommend, you'll feel awesome even if you're completely useless.IT'S GOT HATS PEOPLE, BUY IT NOW ",23,3,1,1,5,0,1

												No wait, don't leave just because it's soccer and has cars. That's what I did for months, and I regret it.Rocket League is best experienced by playing it once. Anywhere, in any state of mind. Just try it once and you'll know if you'd like to play it more. I did, and was hooked. Bought the game the very next day and have averaged 4 hours per day since.The concept is simple enough: You control a car. There's a ball and some goals. The opponent is trying to mess you up and you're trying to put the ball in their goal. Think kindergarten kids playing soccer: They're all just running after the ball with no clue about what to do with it, other than to kick it.Then you start doing pinch-moves on the walls, flying through the air, dribbling on the roof of your car. More advanced techniques to accompany your game. You've become the average player, making some nice looking plays in the air.After a while, you realize there's even a deeper level still. There's positioning, strategies, passing plays, mind-games... While the barrier to entry is really low - It might take you literally less than a minute to get familiar with the controls - it takes years to get to the top, to master some things that are possible. The skill ceiling is impossibly high.The best part is: You'll be having fun all the way.			",143,24,5,15,23,1,21

												This is it. This is the moment your whole life has been leading up to. Weeks of training, months of dedicated work to get yourself into peak condition; all for this. Your brain goes into overdrive as you see the ball barrelling towards you. With a well-placed hit, you effortlessly send it flying to the other side of the field. Your teammate, seeing an opening, leaps toward the ball and continues to lead it towards the opposing team’s goal. Abandoning your position of defense, you begin a pursuit of your own; a pursuit of glory. Time itself seems to slow to a crawl as your comrade sends the ball skyward, right into position. But time is of the essence. and it’s not exactly on your side either. The countdown begins; 10, 9, 8, 7… With the last of your energy, you bound towards the ball at top speed. The odds may be against you, but damn the odds; you’re going for gold! With a graceful leap, you make a last ditch effort to score the winning goal. This’ll be a buzzer-beater to remember!You miss the ball completely.REVIEWRocket LeagueGENREPhysics-Based Car SoccerDeveloped by the up-and-coming game development studio, Psyonix; Rocket League is the far more famous sequel to the lesser-known Playstation Network classic, Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle-Cars. [Hopefully, I won’t have to say that again. Er, type that again.] In Rocket League, you assume control of a battle-car in what can only be assumed is the ‘Rocket League’; a high-octane, high speed, supersport with a high mortality rate. In reality, it's car soccer, but that’s not important; what is important is the fact that you’re a mother♥♥♥♥in’ battle-car playing supersonic future soccer. In this utopian society, Rocket League is a high-intensity sport adored by millions, but experienced only by the elite few. As it just so happens, the ‘elite few’ is actually the ‘not-so-elite you!' Train hard enough though, and you’ll master the wonky physics of car soccer, save so many shots that your teammates may as well just nail you to a cross and call you the son of God, and maybe even perform aerial maneuvers so sick the entire crowd goes home with leukemia! Only the strong will survive in the Rocket League!In theory, Rocket League is almost the quintessence of simplicity within game design. You can drive, drift, jump, and boost. In practice? Not so much. Driving is as straightforward as it comes, mind the fact that you can drive on walls. Drifting is sufficiently simple as well, you can powerslide and change which way you spin whilst mid-air. Jumping, however is where things get complicated. When you jump, you have a variety of options to choose from for your next move. For example: simply pressing the jump button will send you directly skyward, another press and you’ll perform a double-jump. Pressing any direction whilst jumping will send you tumbling in that direction, performing two of these ‘flip-jumps’ in succession will send you barreling in a direction of your choosing without the need for boost. Speaking of boosting; hoo boy. You can boost while driving to, well, boost your speed. Simple, yeah? If you reach maximum speed, hitting an opponent will reduce their car to a smoking pile of rubble. That’s ground-based boosting. Air-based boosting is a whole different ball-park. With a hop, skip, and/or a jump, a little angling, and fingers to press left mouse with; you’ll be able to use your boost to soar gracefully like an eagle! Or not, it takes some practice.So that's the basics of the controls, but what about the game itself? Well, as previously stated, Rocket League is car soccer; no, really. You're in a car, there's two teams and a ball, and the objective is to score the most goals within a five minute timeframe. That's, uh, that's it. Sort of.There's four primary game modes in Rocket League; Duel, Doubles, Standard, and Chaos. Simply put, these are just neat little names for 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4. [Coolio, huh?] There's also ranked variants of all of these archetypes excluding chaos, as it’s, well, a bit chaotic. Occasionally, limited time game modes will appear. At the time of writing, the most recent mode was ‘Snow Day’; a Christmas themed variant featuring lower gravity and a puck rather than a ball. It was pretty neat.Y’know what else is neat? Customization. Y’know what Rocket League has a metric ♥♥♥♥-ton of? CUSTOMIZATION. From body to boost trail, hubcaps to hats, and everything inbetween; Rocket League offers the Cosmetic Junkie within all of us the good♥♥♥♥♥♥ the premium cut. Then again, maybe it's just me that's crazy for that stuff. That ♥♥♥♥♥ my bread’n’butter. I need help. Oh, and don't go worrying your pretty little head about not getting that super-special hat you wanted; Rocket League rewards players with cosmetics after every match regardless of performance.Help, by the by, is in ample supply! Striker, to goalie, learn to play on the fly! Sorry. What I mean to say is that Rocket League has a variety of training modes worn which to hone your skills. In addition to basic and advanced tutorials; there's striker, goalie, and aerial training, as well as basic sandbox mode. The game may be hard to master, but you can't say it doesn't help you along.Let's say you get cold feet though; let's say you're intimidated with the prospect of going straight to online and ballin’ it with someone from Bali. Well, reader, in that case; why not peruse the offline bot-match options? Firstly, there's exhibition mode; a standard bot mode where you make the rules and play at your of leisure. The AI scales in difficulty with 4 increments; Rookie, Pro, All-Star, and Unfair. Unfair is exclusive to exhibition mode, as it's an asymmetric hell-hole. [In a good way, trust me.]Should that not entice you, season mode awaits your beckon. In season mode, you create a team and duke it out in the Rocket League for chance at some good ol’ virtual glory! Simply choose what difficulty, how many players, what team, and how many weeks and bam; you're ready to go.The music’s pretty swanky too, if I do say so myself. [Which is kinda redundant if you think about it; I mean, is it possible to not say something as yourself? Anyway, tangents are pretty neato.] There’s  good tracks in there, a couple okay, but the only true atrocity is that it only plays on the main menu. I mean, yeah, you could always just find the OST on Youtube and play it in the background, but it seems like a smidge of an oversight to be honest.So that's Rocket League; the hip new rocket-sport that all the cool kids on the block have been spackin’ ‘bout! I've never fancied myself much a fan of sports, though I have been getting into football. [Not futbol, mind you.] But I digress, the point is; even if you don't much like sports, this could be the game for you. Simply put, if you're a fan of high-octane, easy to learn, hard to master, physics based, team-reliant, competitive gameplay; Rocket League will be a blast for ya’. It's been hours of fun between my friends and I, and I don't see the end anywhere nearby. Oh, and did I mention there was splitscreen co-op? ♥♥♥♥in' righteous, Psyonix.What did the well-informed consumer say after reading this review?“Well that really got the ball rolling!”			",61,12,1,7,6,0,2

The game is currently on sale (40% off) and if you don't have it, please, do give it a try as it's one of those 'easy-to-get-into' titles.  Even if you're not into the genre, there's a good chance you'll get a lot of fun out of this.Plus, the developers are transparent, responsive, and interactive. They've been providing frequent, free updates, many of which are driven by community feedback.+ Looks great+ Runs great+ Vehicle customisation+ Highly competitive (casual playlists are available if that's your thing)+ Has a subtle crate-key system which can be disabled entirelyAll in all, great value.

												Absolutely beautiful, one of my favorite games of all time, it's fun to get good team plays because it looks cool and the feeling of good communication is great. You have a great blast, with or without friends, you laugh, your adrenaline starts pumping, and it's just amazing. 10/10			",17,0,0,0,1,0,0

												Definitely one of the best competitive games and really freshening in contrast to the strung-out matches in shooters.It's also a great deal for casual gamers, since the ranking system considers their individual skill. Matches just last a few minutes (5 + goal cam) and it's perfect to dawdle away some time (even though you will mostly start one game after each other ;-) ). Long story short, it won't be a mispurchase.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

YouTube™ Video: 1 Minute Review of Rocket League 

			Views: 164		

			FULL LETS PLAY/REVIEW: http://youtu.be/i-y-LwmRTck One of steam's hottest new titles, but is it worth YOUR money? Find out in this quick video and like and subscribe for more quick reviews and lets...		

This game is SO much fun. You play as a rocket car which you can custom design via unlockable special effects and truck body parts. The goal of the game is oh so simple, get the ball in the other teams net but the gameplay and strategy on accomplishing this is where Rocket League becomes something truly special. Everything from the music, graphics and sound effects draws you into the gameplay and really puts you at center stage of all the action regardless of your skill level. The art style is right on the cusp of the so-called ""Uncanny Valley"" meaning everything looks just real enough to not look like a cartoon, but just cartoony enough to keep the ambience fun and light. If you can convince some friends to take the plunge with you, this game is exponentially more fun when you're playing with friends and the game DOES feature multiple split screen options so local multiplayer is not only possible, but comfortable. I was having connection issues when attempting to play online, so online play might be spotty, but the game is quite popular already and it's literally the first couple days of the game's release. Having said that this game is worth having just for the local play with friends alone and I can see this title being a huge hit for the Steambox release coming up soon. BUY THIS you wont be disappointed.			",160,28,1,35,25,1,36

												Pros- Insanely fun with friends.- Still fun when playing solo.- Developer continously working on the game adding new stuff.- DLCs are cheap and exactly how a DLC should be(cosmetics).- Friendly community.- Full fledged training mode to git gud.Cons- Servers are buggy sometimes.- Reconnect option, once you accidentally disconnect could have better implementation.- Xbox one, PS4 and PC combined cross platform missing (cross platform is PS4 PC or XB1 PC only.)Overall, you can't go wrong with this game. There's a learning curve to this game but the ""learning"" part is so much fun.			",127,28,3,6,2,1,12

												I've been playing this game for just about a year now and it is, by far, the best game I have ever played. In the past, I was into shooter games and games that get your blood pressure high. I love soccer, I love cars, and rockets are cool too so I decided to try out Rocket League. It's an amazingly well-developed game with short, 5-10 minute games, tens of thousands of customization options, and even amazing graphics! The developers are getting more and more creative as they add amazing new fields and gamemodes to experiment with. I would definitely recommend this game and it is definitely worth the $20.00.

												This Game has something that really fascinates me, like in the sense that you just dont play ""one quick round"". Nonono you WILL at least play 4 matches until it even crosses your mind to quit again, you maybe think that 100+ Hours are not much in a Game and i would give you right there, but then i need to remind you that 1 match only takes about 5-6 minutes. so yeah, 100+ Hours is a good time in my opinion.Quick Review over the importances to say about this Game:-basically football without human players, just cars-matches that take about 5-6 minutes each-crate system maybe a little too similiar to CS:GO-1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4s in many different gamemodesGamemodes-Normal 1v1,2v2 etc. as you see everywhere-1v1,2v2 etc. in a ranked system-Rumble is basically normal 3v3 with powerups to♥♥♥♥♥♥each other off, great variety and great fun-Hockey, well its hockey, what did you expect. ball is a puck and the floor is ice-Rocket Labs, normal 3v3 just on experimental maps you wont see anywhere else, great fun for trying something new-And the Last ist Basketball, this gamemode isnt too much fun since the maps are abysmaly small but its pretty good for learning how to flyAnd thats basically it, not much right? Well yeah if you look at it that way its really small in Content, however this Game is damn competitive and addicting if you can get into the scenario of car football.If you are still into that then by all means, buy it.thanks for reading through my ramblings :3			",417,98,15,24,29,1,40

												This is an awesome game, it's one of my favourites. The matches aren't heavily time consuming, so it's a great game to pick up and kill a few minutes. It also has a great competitive system if you are into ranking on games.Lastly, I highly reccomend a controller to be used. I played with keyboard and mouse for a long time and I could definately see the difference in performance once I started using an xbox 360 controller on my PC. It just makes the gameplay smoother.

												Decided to try it out since it was a free weekend. I knew it would be good based on gameplay I'd seen and seeing the features it has. I was worried I'd get addicted, and I am. Bought it. Too late to turn back. Worth it.Visually, the game looks great. The particle effects, the stadiums, awesome job. You really get immersed into everything.The controls are very easy. Right now I'm using a mouse and keyboard. After a few hours straight of playing, my W, A, S, D fingers were sore (lots of movement in this game). I plan on trying the game out with a controller (which seems to be the popular way to go). Like other reviews say, it's a breeze to pick up but hard to master. But so far in only 3 hours of playing, I would say I can hold my own quite well. Been matched up against pros (there's ranks that will appear under names such as Rookie, Semi-Pro, Pro (I think it goes higher)) and I've been able to outmaneuver them. The game takes some patience. Setting up shots for your teammates, waiting for the right time to thrust in and hit the ball; not just driving crazy and hitting the ball just to hit it. If you're worried about how you play, there's tutorials and training you can go through. I haven't done any of that (I'd rather learn by diving straight into a match) and I turned out fine. But there's lots of help if you want to get better.As far as the DLC, I haven't bought any, but they look neat. The cosmetics and car types are very appealing and bring a fun element to the game. I have several thousand hours in TF2, so maybe I'm biased :P And you acquire some after matches, it's not like you have to go in and buy stuff, that's just the DLC that costs money. Everything else you get by playing the game, which I love.I highly recommend this game. You don't have to like cars or soccer to play this. It's just fun.			",57,0,3,1,3,1,9

I really love this game, and the price is completely worth it.My English is not the best, sorry about that... ;)Edit 1: Fixed formatting.Edit 2: Fixed some wrong typed words. ",53,10,2,2,8,0,4

												This game really reminds me of Road Trip Adventure game on PS2 that first I had played it and play car football minigame when Im childhood. Looks like Rocket League was remake from Road Trip Adventure but both really fun with past and now. See this video shows play car football from RTA gameplay. :D*Not my gameplay*

												Pros- Insanely fun with friends.- Still fun when playing solo.- Developer continously working on the game adding new stuff.- DLCs are cheap and exactly how a DLC should be(cosmetics).- Friendly community.- Full fledged training mode to git gud.Cons- Servers are buggy sometimes.- Reconnect option, once you accidentally disconnect could have better implementation.- Xbox one, PS4 and PC combined cross platform missing (cross platform is PS4 PC or XB1 PC only.)Overall, you can't go wrong with this game. There's a learning curve to this game but the ""learning"" part is so much fun.			",127,28,3,6,2,1,12

												I love this game so much that I own it on every platform.It's incredibly fun for a game with such a simple formula. It's enjoyable if you have only 10 minutes of free time to play, or if you want to binge for hours; it never gets old. The developers are fantastic; really involved with the community, constantly updating the game with new requested features, and best of all, no pay-to-win microtransactions. Personally I'm completely fine with paying a couple of bucks for some new cars just as a way to support Psyonix. It's just really refreshing to see a genuinely fun game made by genuinely great developers, especially in the cesspool of microtransactions and cut-content that is the AAA game industry today.TL:DR -  Wow!Wow!Wow!Chat disabled for 1 seconds.

												As every multiplayer game, I recommend getting a friend or two to play it with you, you get used to the controls quickly, they're simple. The game is fun.I was a little worried about this game, cause I dislike football and racing games, this game is NOTHING like those two genres. Definitely would recommend, you'll feel awesome even if you're completely useless.IT'S GOT HATS PEOPLE, BUY IT NOW ",23,3,1,1,5,0,1

												This is an awesome game, it's one of my favourites. The matches aren't heavily time consuming, so it's a great game to pick up and kill a few minutes. It also has a great competitive system if you are into ranking on games.Lastly, I highly reccomend a controller to be used. I played with keyboard and mouse for a long time and I could definately see the difference in performance once I started using an xbox 360 controller on my PC. It just makes the gameplay smoother.

												Rocket league, what a game, I was surprised the very first moment I saw some videos of it. ""Cars and football? Sure why not, it really looks like fun!""And so I tried it to see if that was true, and indeed it was.Can't stop playing now, and I don't know if I will for a long time since you always want to progress, but I gotta say it has one of the best, if not the best, developers I have ever seen.Add the amazing music, graphics, and playability and you have a great game. 10/10.

												Decided to try it out since it was a free weekend. I knew it would be good based on gameplay I'd seen and seeing the features it has. I was worried I'd get addicted, and I am. Bought it. Too late to turn back. Worth it.Visually, the game looks great. The particle effects, the stadiums, awesome job. You really get immersed into everything.The controls are very easy. Right now I'm using a mouse and keyboard. After a few hours straight of playing, my W, A, S, D fingers were sore (lots of movement in this game). I plan on trying the game out with a controller (which seems to be the popular way to go). Like other reviews say, it's a breeze to pick up but hard to master. But so far in only 3 hours of playing, I would say I can hold my own quite well. Been matched up against pros (there's ranks that will appear under names such as Rookie, Semi-Pro, Pro (I think it goes higher)) and I've been able to outmaneuver them. The game takes some patience. Setting up shots for your teammates, waiting for the right time to thrust in and hit the ball; not just driving crazy and hitting the ball just to hit it. If you're worried about how you play, there's tutorials and training you can go through. I haven't done any of that (I'd rather learn by diving straight into a match) and I turned out fine. But there's lots of help if you want to get better.As far as the DLC, I haven't bought any, but they look neat. The cosmetics and car types are very appealing and bring a fun element to the game. I have several thousand hours in TF2, so maybe I'm biased :P And you acquire some after matches, it's not like you have to go in and buy stuff, that's just the DLC that costs money. Everything else you get by playing the game, which I love.I highly recommend this game. You don't have to like cars or soccer to play this. It's just fun.			",57,0,3,1,3,1,9

We were just having a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of fun.If you want a competitive experience, i can't adress that.But if you wanna have some mindless fun with cars playing football?

												Rocket League is an amazing game and if I have to be honest, probably the best multiplayer experience I have ever had. Bold claim indeed, but I can't think of a time when I haven't invested atleast up to 10 hours per week on it.Rocket League's gameplay on the surface is as simple and clear as it can get. You have a symmetrical field, two teams with 1-4 players on each side and a ball. Kick the ball into the enemies goal to win and that's the only objective. Literally RC car football. But once you get used to the bare mechanics of the game, Rocket League starts to unfold its brilliance. Not before long you'll end up denying boost spots so that your enemy can't get the valuable boosts, crashing into enemies to make them go boom or kick the goalie away, rotating your car midair to hit the ball precisely into a specific direction and changing/rotating positions with your team in order to keep your goal guarded and to lay pressure on the enemies one.  The game allows for very strategic play and feels truly awarding when you end up victorious in a close match that went into +10min overtime against an equally skilled enemy team.Rocket League offers a good amount of playlists and game modes. Casual modes for some fun time after a long day, Competitive modes where the game will rank you according to your skill and even Hockey/Basketball/Rumble mode to change it up from time to time. I think that the ranking system as of now (Nov 2016) works really well and manages to keep me motivated, striving for better rankings (Grand Champion, here I come). Hockey and Basketball modes aren't very populated though and it can take a minute or longer to find people.Servers work fine for the most part, however you'll occasionally experience rubberbanding and lag which can be excessive, even in Competitive mode which can sour your experience. These issues however I have mostly encountered in Casual modes.Rocket League offers a sizeable amount of customization options for your car, from different chassis to wheels, colours, flags, decals and boost trails. It allows for some really funny and great looking vehicles and the recently added crates offer another big pool of content to work with. My only complaint is that decals aren't universal except for a few and the colour pallete isn't as big as I hoped for.Technically, Rocket League shines. The game is not a benchmark title per se, but it runs extremely smooth with no spikes whatsoever and offers a good amount of graphical options. I couldn't test performance with other cards myself (mine is a GTX980 - game runs up to 270FPS) but my friend has issues running it on a 310m on low settings(+30 FPS, Aquadome and Neo Tokyo are unplayable) so people with such low hardware should consider this before purchase.The visual style is very colorful and crisp. Rocket League doesn't suffer from visibility issues (it used to when cars exploded but it has been fixed since) and screen shake can be disabled (which I recommend). You can switch between two types of cameras: One that shows you everything right ahead of your car and ""Ballcam"" which tracks ball movement. Second option can be confusing at first but it is essential to learn using it, which after a while becomes second nature once you have developed good spatial awareness. Big plus: the camera can also be customized to your liking.I have never played a Multiplayer game that was this much fun and addictive. I highly recommend it to everyone who is looking for a fun and competitively viable game.If you excuse me, I've got to pwn some noo...*gets hit by teammate*AAAAAIIIIIIMPOOOOOOT!!!

												Believe the hype. Like many classics of their time, Counter-Strike, Quake... even Spacewar, this game's simplicity is its strength. Just basic gameplay with oodles of nuance.Yup... oodles.It also doesn't hurt that the developers are extremely engaged with the community. At least, it doesn't hurt since they're committed to not fiddling and tweaking and throwing in gimmicks to the core modes. Most choices are cosmetic and what counts is how you play. No pay to win! How about that?So hop in and bop the ball around with others at your skill level! And when you get up to the point where people are flying off the walls and knocking the ball into your goal from midair, rest assured it's not because they bought fancy gear or gained enough levels to give them perks. You can do it too, right from the start, even... with enough practice.			",74,16,8,3,13,2,4

												Rocket League is an amazing game and if I have to be honest, probably the best multiplayer experience I have ever had. Bold claim indeed, but I can't think of a time when I haven't invested atleast up to 10 hours per week on it.Rocket League's gameplay on the surface is as simple and clear as it can get. You have a symmetrical field, two teams with 1-4 players on each side and a ball. Kick the ball into the enemies goal to win and that's the only objective. Literally RC car football. But once you get used to the bare mechanics of the game, Rocket League starts to unfold its brilliance. Not before long you'll end up denying boost spots so that your enemy can't get the valuable boosts, crashing into enemies to make them go boom or kick the goalie away, rotating your car midair to hit the ball precisely into a specific direction and changing/rotating positions with your team in order to keep your goal guarded and to lay pressure on the enemies one.  The game allows for very strategic play and feels truly awarding when you end up victorious in a close match that went into +10min overtime against an equally skilled enemy team.Rocket League offers a good amount of playlists and game modes. Casual modes for some fun time after a long day, Competitive modes where the game will rank you according to your skill and even Hockey/Basketball/Rumble mode to change it up from time to time. I think that the ranking system as of now (Nov 2016) works really well and manages to keep me motivated, striving for better rankings (Grand Champion, here I come). Hockey and Basketball modes aren't very populated though and it can take a minute or longer to find people.Servers work fine for the most part, however you'll occasionally experience rubberbanding and lag which can be excessive, even in Competitive mode which can sour your experience. These issues however I have mostly encountered in Casual modes.Rocket League offers a sizeable amount of customization options for your car, from different chassis to wheels, colours, flags, decals and boost trails. It allows for some really funny and great looking vehicles and the recently added crates offer another big pool of content to work with. My only complaint is that decals aren't universal except for a few and the colour pallete isn't as big as I hoped for.Technically, Rocket League shines. The game is not a benchmark title per se, but it runs extremely smooth with no spikes whatsoever and offers a good amount of graphical options. I couldn't test performance with other cards myself (mine is a GTX980 - game runs up to 270FPS) but my friend has issues running it on a 310m on low settings(+30 FPS, Aquadome and Neo Tokyo are unplayable) so people with such low hardware should consider this before purchase.The visual style is very colorful and crisp. Rocket League doesn't suffer from visibility issues (it used to when cars exploded but it has been fixed since) and screen shake can be disabled (which I recommend). You can switch between two types of cameras: One that shows you everything right ahead of your car and ""Ballcam"" which tracks ball movement. Second option can be confusing at first but it is essential to learn using it, which after a while becomes second nature once you have developed good spatial awareness.

												Rocket League is a very addicting game. Plus-Easy to learn, hard to master. -Good soundtrack.-Constant updates and new content.-DLC isn't pay2win. You can be the best player in the world by only using the vanilla car.-Steam Workshop support.-Training can be customized to your preference and what skill you want to learn.-Very fun to play. -Cross-platform play (Although you can't party with player from different platforms)Minus-Crate system/microtransaction (You can disable/hide the crate in the Options though.)-The chance of getting painted wheels from random drops is extremely low. If you really want to get painted wheels, you have to pray to RNG or trade with keys instead.			",82,13,3,5,8,2,11

												When I saw Rocket League first time, I found it silly. It started being played so much in streams. I thought, why do people play this silly game. One of my close friends who bought this game sometimes enters the game and tells me to buy it. I bought it by saying If so we play together and enjoy so I have no regret. We can consider this game ""haxball in the third dimension"". That's because They two are the games which looks like easy while watching but after playing, you realise that you cant do what you think in.There is not so many words to say about the game, since it has no story or something like that. To get used to play is crucial and I dont think that you dont need any skill when you play. You memorize the ball physics by training after a while. If you learn to set the kicking ball timing, the rest is about luckiness. There is something called aerial kick that I can't do well and think it is the only hard thing in this game. It might be de done by training and playing but somehow I cant. Though, I dont really play so much. I play 2-3 games in 4-5 days.In short, I suggest you to buy this game. You won't regret but It starts boring you after 2-3 games.			",48,3,1,1,7,0,2

 Basic is Beautiful Rocket League is a basic yet a complex game, Concept-wise it is pretty simple you have 2 Goals and a ball, you can already see where this is going, but don't be fooled by the simplicity, because you are Controlling an R/C Car that has a Rocket booster attached to it, which you can use to fly, and make acrobatic plays, with a Rank-up & unlock system Let's Dive Deeper: Pros:    Very Intuitive  You Don't need a sporting background to enjoy or understand the game  Friendly community  Extremely fun!  Has Casual & Competitive Options And Matches Ranging from 1v1's to the Chaotic 4v4's  Full Controller Support  Cross-platform play (PS4} = HUGE player-base  Crazy addictive / has the ""One more game"" Charm to it.  Runs on the Unreal engine = Great Graphics  Cons.    Servers are a little bit Wonky  Lack of Content, i know that they release the DLC, but i'm frankly not sure if the new                                    Customizations/Cars are worth the Money  Game issues where you can't rejoin a game if you disconnected from it  Verdict: It's a Simple Masterpiece and a classical example that games don't need to be complicated, they just need to be              fun , it has some rough edges but these problems can be annoying sometimes, but they're not enough to bring this game down.

												10/5 stars. Psyonix somehow managed to digitize FUN, and this game is the result. A simple concept with a brilliant execution. The replay value increases with every explosive goal and epic save, all presented with perfectly-balanced visuals which provide serious eye-candy without getting in the way of ROCKET-POWERED CARS AND TRUCKS PLAYING RC FOOTY. Seriously. Awesome. I'm not exaggerating when I say I got my money's worth within ten minutes of first launching the game. I still have a kid-like grin on my face whenever I play, the whole time, every time.			",130,14,3,18,22,1,37

												By now you already know what this game is about, so no need for an introduction. Highly competitive, skill based game. It will take a huge chunk of your time to master, but you can enjoy it at all skill levels. More content like cars, cosmetics and maps, are added from time to time in the from of DLC.

												It's an easy game that is fun from the beginning, specially with that low learning curve. Over time you start controlling your vehicle better and better, start doing tricks with your boosters and perfecting the strategies with your teammates. Shoots on goal, saves and aerials can all be trained in the training area, where even real complicated scenarios are recreated with a ball canon that shoots at you. You can also play offline against bots, but they only get good of they are set on All-Star (highest difficulty), yet they still have the tendency to score own goals.

												First of all. If you head and check the negative reviews 9/10 of them will be complaining about the servers from the first few days of launch. The game has had over 10x the amount of players they expected from the Beta statistics. If you check their twitter you'll see they've been working their asses off, non-stop since launch to make sure the servers are better and faster. (Which they now are)I played the original game Super Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-cars and loved it. It was a genius idea and very well executed. This game is a polished off and perfected version. The game is very simple and easy to learn, yet hard to master. I have to say, out of the past 5-6 years of PC gaming it is one of the most fun and enjoyable experiences I have had, even with how little I have played it as of yet. For £14.99 it is an absolute steal! It is fun offline and on, without a doubt.			",315,55,12,49,22,4,38

												Its basically a football with cars. When you get in the game for the first time I suggest to play tutorial first so you can learn basics and advanced skills and then go into multiplayer 4 vs 4 CHAOS or 3 vs 3,2 vs 2 NORMAL and 1 vs 1 DUEL. When you played the round when you won or lost you get new items or a new car. You can customize your your car boost engine to for an example: snowflakes, sparkles and much more... You can customize your tires of the car and your antenna which can have your country on or other things like skull, heart, snowman and more... You can even put on the head of car for an example: a crown, taxi lighter and more...You can choose which color of the car you want. On the blue is green or blue or mixed, on the red its red or yellow or mixed together.From level 1-10 your ROOKIE, from level 10-20 your SEMI-PRO, from level 20-30 your PRO, from 30-40 your VETERAN, from 40-50 your EXPERT, from 50-60 your MASTER. And that means each time your level goes higher you will face more skilled player from multiplayer.The gameplay is simple, hit the ball in the goal, when your ingame you can pickup a small or big yellow things on the field which give you boost, with boost you can get fater to the goal before other enemy team shoot on it. But if your teammate shoots the ball almost to the goal, use the boost and go fast and shoot on the goal and win.My rate: 11/10Just like jacksepticeye said: SPEED IS KEEEEY!!!!EDIT: I love the new updates and DLCs, it makes you wanna play even more and im playing it since I did this whole review. Good job Psyonix!!!!!			",127,21,4,5,13,3,7

												Haven't heard of this game? You're on the steam page, of course you have.Haven't got this game? Get it.Got the game? Get the DLC.Got the DLC? Get the other DLC's.Got all the DLC's? Get some crates. Trade up. Get your favourite items.Got everything? Watch some Rocket League tournaments, or even compete for yourself.Done all that? Your life is complete.On a slightly more serious note, this game has a lot of customisation and a surprisingly long learning curve, where you are still learning new things at 1000+ hours. There are tons of montages and videos with a good community (once you get past Challenger, anyway) and finding nice people is surprisingly easy.I also want to point out that this game will last a long time. I bought this game over a year ago, and I thought that I wouldn't play it for very long. Here I am, closing in on 1000 hours every day. This game is extremely in-depth, even with it's very flat-looking surface, so if you are worried about that, worry no more!			",35,3,3,2,6,1,3

												10/5 stars. Psyonix somehow managed to digitize FUN, and this game is the result. A simple concept with a brilliant execution. The replay value increases with every explosive goal and epic save, all presented with perfectly-balanced visuals which provide serious eye-candy without getting in the way of ROCKET-POWERED CARS AND TRUCKS PLAYING RC FOOTY. Seriously. Awesome. I'm not exaggerating when I say I got my money's worth within ten minutes of first launching the game. I still have a kid-like grin on my face whenever I play, the whole time, every time.			",130,14,3,18,22,1,37

It's fun, simple, beautiful and now that the matchmaking servers are up and running properly, pretty smooth as far as netcode goes.Keep in mind I am a person who loathes sports and sports games, yet this might be one of my favorite games to date.4-player splitscreen (not that I have anyone to test it with), PS4 crossplay, high degree of customizability, absolutely no pay2win aspects, all future maps and cosmetics will be free of charge and other features simply add up to a very solid game.10 out of 10, bought with no regrets.

 Basic is Beautiful Rocket League is a basic yet a complex game, Concept-wise it is pretty simple you have 2 Goals and a ball, you can already see where this is going, but don't be fooled by the simplicity, because you are Controlling an R/C Car that has a Rocket booster attached to it, which you can use to fly, and make acrobatic plays, with a Rank-up & unlock system Let's Dive Deeper: Pros:    Very Intuitive  You Don't need a sporting background to enjoy or understand the game  Friendly community  Extremely fun!  Has Casual & Competitive Options And Matches Ranging from 1v1's to the Chaotic 4v4's  Full Controller Support  Cross-platform play (PS4} = HUGE player-base  Crazy addictive / has the ""One more game"" Charm to it.  Runs on the Unreal engine = Great Graphics  Cons.

												When I saw Rocket League first time, I found it silly. It started being played so much in streams. I thought, why do people play this silly game. One of my close friends who bought this game sometimes enters the game and tells me to buy it. I bought it by saying If so we play together and enjoy so I have no regret. We can consider this game ""haxball in the third dimension"". That's because They two are the games which looks like easy while watching but after playing, you realise that you cant do what you think in.There is not so many words to say about the game, since it has no story or something like that. To get used to play is crucial and I dont think that you dont need any skill when you play. You memorize the ball physics by training after a while. If you learn to set the kicking ball timing, the rest is about luckiness. There is something called aerial kick that I can't do well and think it is the only hard thing in this game. It might be de done by training and playing but somehow I cant. Though, I dont really play so much. I play 2-3 games in 4-5 days.In short, I suggest you to buy this game. You won't regret but It starts boring you after 2-3 games.			",48,3,1,1,7,0,2

												Never was a fan of football, and I never will be. Hell, not just football, any sport that requires me to do stuff. Although, I am a fan of vehicles. Cars, specifically. I wouldn't mind playing this for the rest of my life. It has a good choice of cars, even better if you have DLC cars (gotta pay for them though). Awesome maps, and has a competitive part to it, where you can play ranked matches. It also has cross-platform multiplayer, which is something R* should do with GTA Online. You can play with your friends if they're on PS4 or X1 and you're on the master race. Valve should take a look at RL and see how servers should be. SERVERS THAT ACTUALLY WORK, UNLIKE IN CS WHERE EVERY SECOND MATCH EVERYONE'S PING IS 4000+. Oh, and I found out that you can have pre-mades on your team for ranked matches, which is very dope and you don't get matched against other pre-mades, which is not entirely fair. Overall, good game, would recommend.			",41,9,0,1,2,0,8

												A great team oriented game that does require some player skill to be effective. Controls are intuitive and easy to learn but hard to master. Momentum and geometry are your enemy, beside the other players! The game allows you to save the entire game video and you can use the very robust video review tool to review your epic shots and saves. It has many camera angles and video speed playback option so you can FRAPS your highlights. I strongly recommend this game because of its replayability and great features. Get a group of your friends together and settle old beefs on the pitch. 5/5			",430,56,40,38,43,2,44

												Great game, easy to get the hang of and has a mostly friendly community. despite the odd salty people or rage quitters which is unavoidable in most multiplayer games. Psyonix do a fantastic job of listening to their community and providing free content based on what the people want. Has a great tutorial system for newcomers, and a seamless multiplayer matchmaking system. In all, fantastic game. Well worth the $20. 10/10			",3,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The controls are easy. the mechanics are easy. The matches are quick but very intense. You'll learn fast that just because you can fly around the map at top speed with ease, that's not always the best approach. It's not the kind of game you'll sit and play for hours at a time, but its one you'll come back to over and over again. Each game takes only 5 minutes, the game is less than 1gig of HDD space, and it loads up quick. Girlfriend runs to the bathroom while you're watching netflix together? Load up Rocket League, play a match and by the time she gets back you're already done. Plus, you won. Achieve victory while others leave the room. Micro-accomplishments gained by tiny rocket cars on a soccer field. $20 seems a bit high priced, but you can always ask Steam for a refund :) A great pick-up-and-play game while taking a break from shooters and RPG's. I regret nothing about buying this title.			",123,12,2,13,8,1,9

												*Controller Intro*:I'm playing this game with a PS4 controller pluged in the PC ( it works natively on Windows, without using any programs ) and the game recognises the controller as the PS4 controller, giving me all the controls in pop-ups accurately. I was kinda amazed.Now for the gameplay.This is a fast and tactical game, despite all the chaos that will happen on the field.The controls are simple and easy to get used to just after a few games, but very hard to master.The goal of the game is to score a goal by wrestling with a GINORMOUS ball while fighting with your opponents and trying to coordinate with your team.The matches are fun and exciting, lasting from 6 to 10 minutes, depending on the amount of goals scored in the match.The customization is wild and rampart, with the cars having the same ""stats"", except the minor hitbox changes.There are several game-modes, and if you're familiar with the FIFA or Pro Evolution Soccer games, you will understand what they are.You have the Exhibition game mode where you play ONE match with your adjustable settings.You have the Season game mode consisting of multiple matches that follow a basic tournament format.And you have the Play Online mode (currently down on 7.7.15, the launch day) that has Unranked and Ranked game modes.If you are a fan of fun, this is a game for you.

												Fantastic game with a lot of customization and stuff to do. Platformwise they cover everything with competitive matchmaking but also splitscreen with your friends, which on PC you don't see too often. The game is also on PS4 and there is crossplatform capabilities in place. I'm runningat least 60 fps when in a game of 4v4 with bots and almost everything maxed out at 1920x1200 on my 7950.If you play games like FIFA you're in for a surprise, no help with aiming or targeting, it's all physics based. It's fast, hard and incredibly satisfying.I played in the alpha and beta on PC and all I can say is that the developer, Psyonix, deserve your money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you hate football? Have you always felt that footballers would be a more appealing bunch if they had a boost engine attached to them and could do flips and stuff? Well, worry no more, Rocket League is here.If you never played the original game, Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars, then you completely missed out on one of the greatest hidden gems on the PS3. Rocket League is the sequel to that game- arcade football with RC cars. If that sounds simple, that's because it is. However, as many players of the original found out, it's deceptively simple. While the controls and the aim of the game are easy to pick up, there's definitely a big gap between a good player and a bad player; mastering the physics of the ball and your own car take a long time.Rocket League is a step up from the original in nearly every single way. The game looks gorgeous, has a great soundtrack and the customisable options are off the charts. Psyonix are fantastic, down-to-earth developers and really deserve to be supported for making such a love-letter to the community they've fostered and cherished over the years.

												This game...What a gem this game is. The concept is simple, It's soccer with cars.  Seems simple enough yet this is one of the most fun games you could have played this year. Rocket League is a game that makes you say, ""Just one more match"" which turns into hours as its fun and addicting gameplay keeps you coming back for more. As you play, you collect accessories for your cars while gaining levels which luckily is done right in this game. Any game that makes you move with the gameplay because of how into it you become is doing something right. There is DLC for this game which gives you more car types and accessories and one nice thing is that Psyonix gives you the new arenas for free. This company deserves your money and have done everything right in my books to make this game one that I will continue to come back too for a long time to come. This is my personal Game of The Year and is highly recommended to anybody who loves a good time!Update: This game is still Top-Tier!			",305,50,5,19,27,5,9

												This is a challenging game. At times quite frustrating and for some reason, I have seen the worst come out in people with this game. For whatever reason there are a lot of people that become sarcastic, they criticize and become nasty, or just plain mean.   Also, beware of people cheating you out of your stuff, scammers etc. It's bad enough with the crate system, costing you about 30.00 per crate, time 4 is 120.00 to hopefully unlock a cool looking set of wheels or something. I think it is absurd though that when you spend money on these things your chances of getting duplicates is great! I have spent about 50.00 opening crates to get 1 ""cool"" decal and loads of duplicate ""rare decals for cars I won't use.... That kinda rubs me wrong. Makes me think the developers are too greedy. Its a lot for nothing is how I see that. But as far as driving and flying, It's cool			",49,2,2,2,1,0,1

												Rocket league is a game that provides a fun fast paced experience unlike any other game, you may hate sports games and you may hate car games but rocket league offers a very different experience with a big learning curve due to its particular style.You may be asking the big question, how is it different to any other sports game or experience? Well I'll tell you why,Rocket league offers a much different perspective on sports games, and I'm not just talking about the camera angle, size of the pitch etc.  even though they are factors, I'm talking about controls, what I mean by this is, take fifa for example, to pass the ball (For controller) Press A, most of the time that will mean the ball will pass to another player then that player has the ball, to shoot is B, the ball will cleanly come off the player and shoot in the direction of the goal with little aim required, when you are dribbling, the ball will stick to your feet until contact is applied. When you are playing rocket league that completely changes, if you want to pass you have to make it happen, if you want to shoot you have to do it yourself, there is not a button to do so, this means you have to utilise all your controls and you're physically doing absolutely everything in your power to make something happen.  This means there is so much room for diversity in gameplay and skill, so many skills that are vital to one's success, just because you know the most complex skill doesn't mean you have won, You must learn to adapt in different circumstances and understand the situation. Rocket league may seem very repetitive at a first glance playing a 5 minute game on practically the same field but thats where you are wrong, rocket league will make you come back wanting more and more and more. Rocket league is a game where even after 100s and 1000s of hours, you can still improve drastically, every hour being more rewarding and fun than the last, I am still amazed at how much more I can learn even after I have played for ages. This game is very fun and I can't stop playing, I would recommend this game to anyone and I believe regardless of your preference you should definetly give this game a go.Overall 9.5/10			",29,3,1,4,1,1,1

												Most people probably don't want to read a long review, so I'm going to keep this one fairly short. Rocket league is just simply Soccer/Football with Cars. I personally HATE Soccer but I really do still love playing this game. One of the things that I especially love is that it is hard to master, and it takes many hours to actually start to develop in the game. This is NOT one of those easy to pick up games and you'll have to either train or play lots of games to get better. The gameplay has not gotten boring whatsoever so far, and I really do recommend this game to ANYBODY, no matter your opinion on the sport itself			",45,4,0,3,8,0,2

												Not much of an review, just a warm recommendationstraight from my heart.---RECOMMENDATION---Rocket League is a football/soccer game,with Nitro-Cars.This is a football/racing game, where each team startsat their respective sides on the field, and the ballis dead dropped in the middle, and the goal,is obvious, scoring goals. Each round is set to5 minutes, if the score is set to draw at the endof the clock, you go to overtime, and the first teamto score wins.Might not sound that fun, neither thought I whenI first saw this game popping up at Steam.But when I started playing it, it was a whole differentthing. This game is freaking addictive, fun and competitive,and just blew me away.Rocket League is developed by Psyonix. Not the mostknown developer team, but they do have some experience,mainly developing Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Carson Ps3 and Co-Developing Unreal Tournament 2004 with Epic Games.And that shows, as the core mechanics are tight and precise.The Nitro-cars can use boostersyou fill up by driving over glowing circles around the field,you can double-jump and do trick-shots, and it's sosatisfying to score goals, doing that one insane trick-jump thatjust manages to nudge that ball into the goal, then watch the gloryin replay. Teamplay is important in this game,having a team mate passing the ball just right so you canboost in and do a trick-jump and score.The game is also fair, as there's no bs perks or unlockableitems that can give you an advantage in the match.The unlockables are straight visual changes, as well as the cars youunlock throughout the game. So everyone is playing onequal terms, and it's skills and team play that will determinethe winner.You can either play against Bots in customs matches,or seasons mode where you'll play in a leaguespanning over a set number of weeks.The bots are pretty good at Pro difficulty.At rookie they're too easy and dumb, so playingat Pro is the sweet spot between useless andunfair.If you're after some more intellectual opponents,head over to the multiplayer.This game supports 2, 3 and 4 player split-screenfor playing with friends.If split-screen ain't your cup of tea, no problem,this game features Match Making and Dedicated Servers.Set up a private lobby with your friends or play againstrandom people. This game features 1vs1, 2vs2, 3vs3 and 4vs4matches.Currently this game has a pretty large player-base for an indie game,and that's thanks to Cross-Platform play between PC and Ps4.The graphics are splendid, colourful and visually exciting, so nothingto complain about here.I really don't have much of any complaints regarding this game,tho some might feel as there's little content in this game,with there only being one game modeand no performance-enchanting upgrades for your cars, but,in my opinion, that's what makes this game great, everyone isplaying on equal terms, and the core mechanics in my opinion,is so fun and addictive that it doesn't really need more gamemodes to satisfy me.If you're a person who appreciates these types of games, this onemight be perfect for you, either you just want to casually playalone or with friends, or take it up to a competitive level, this gamejust works, and will give me many many hours of funentertainment.I strongly recommend this game for anyone wanting to trysomething different and looking for either casual funor competitive play either against bots or online.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more reviews and recommendations, please visithttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/6966222-Bad-English-Game-Reviews/ ",540,180,18,84,31,4,53

												    Dear Informed reader,    In a hole in the ground there lived a _Xx_Fazerino_goondoolf_exdee_xX_, the most magnificent of all beings with their quick wit and eagerness to succeed in the video of games. However, this is no ordinary _Xx_Fazerino_goondoolf_exdee_xX_, for this particular specimen has travelled vastly from the corners of cod campers to the slopes of Dromund Kaas (discount Old Republic) to bring you this oversaturated family friendly review in the most savage matter. Long has this wizard travelled being known in the north by the Hobbits of Eriador as Gandalf the Undeniably Gingertastic, by those in the south the rednecks of all societies (F4Ze clan) as _Xx_Fazerino_goondoolf_exdee_xX_, but most commonly know as ""Goondoolf the supr wise and awsme u knw fam"" mainly by himself. Although this matters not for his skills measure wide and vast conquering any achievement by any mere mortal other than himself, such as his ultra superb french skills ""Oui Oui! That's all I know...."", to his oh so adorable stories about how he danced in Grade 1 as a small Sugar Plum Fairy. most broadly he is revered for his mastery of that which is the game Room Escape, or so he pronounced it for many years, and his overall 62 million defence experience mind you he never truly received his max cape... frikn noob. In short, this man is so accomplished you can't even begin to truly convey your emotions before they destroy your innermost organs from his overall goodlookingness and Roblox skillz, and therefore you should listen intently to his awesome review. Without any further ado I happily present _Xx_Fazerino_goondoolf_exdee_xX_'s epictastic review chock-full of savagery, romance, Captain Jack Sparrow and of course Star Wars Conspiracy theories about Han Solo being alive and being an ewok who 360 no scopes good ol' Snokerino in the face. Review in 3, 2 , 1...._Xx_Fazerino_goondoolf_exdee_xX_: Well... at least I tried it i suppose. It's decent ya know?			",44,2,0,12,4,1,1

 Intro                              Rocket League Review: How Long Have I Had Rocket League? Purchased: Jul 7, 2015 @ 8:53amIt all started when I wanted to watch one of my faveorate Youtubers (Northernlion). I have problems trying new things so I decided to watch a new video (He does ALOT of The Binding of Isaac). This video was of Rocket League. As you see I have had this game since release on PC. When I started watching this new video i was thinking to myself ""This is the greatest @$#@! OF ALL TIME!"". Not only did I want this game I watched that video at least 100+ times till the game released. Let's just say if I had not watched that video and tryed something new I would be VERY upset with myself knowing I could have gotten this amazing game on launch day.  Pros/Cons Pros: Replayability Good Community Up To 4 Player Split-Screen CO-OP Good Ranking System Consistant Updates Amazing Trade System Wow!  What a Save!Cons: GG! Rematch! One More Game! Wow! Thanks! Chat disabled for 4 seconds Chat disabled for 3 seconds Chat disabled for 3 seconds Chat disabled for 2 seconds Chat disabled for 2 seconds Chat disabled for 2 seconds Chat disabled for 1 seconds Chat disabled for 1 seconds Chat disabled for 1 seconds Chat disabled for 1 seconds What a Save!

												This game is amazing. Need i say more?!This game is a great mixture of fun and challenge, as you go up the levels you slowly improve, the matchmaking is great but can often throw a rookie in which is really funny but mean for them! This is an amazing game and the bots are sometimes challenging but sometimes ridiculous, i would like a level above all-star difficulty as i feel now that it is fairly easy to play against them. I would really recommend playing with a controller thoough, it's really hard to quickly do things so the controller is essential to play in general. Very good game all-in-all. The new updates adding ♥♥♥♥♥♥ maps are really ♥♥♥♥ing annoying, I lag out and get ♥♥♥♥ing demoted, and I get♥♥♥♥♥♥teammates all the time. Please remove the crap maps that lag me out and find a system to kick toxic players who just moan at you. I'm quitting ♥♥♥♥ing competitive because of this crap. ♥♥♥♥ this game.I'd rate this game 94/100On second thoughts, 83/100			",143,26,3,13,14,5,11

												If you like arcadey driving games, simple sports games, and playing against your friends, Rocket League could become your next online addiction. Essentially soccer with cars and a giant ball, this game has you drive around an enclosed arena, bumping into other players as you try to knock the ball into the goal. But in keeping with the arcade spirit, the physics are a bit on the unrealistic side, which is why your car can hop up and twist, you can drive up the sides of walls, and head-on crashes only cause you to bounce back (though, admittedly, the physics may be too unbelievable for those looking for a real athletic challenge). You also can play matches up to four-on-four, either online, via split-screen, or in a mix of the two, though the more populated matches tend to be a bit too chaotic. There's even an exhibition mode where you can play against the computer, and these matches also go up to four-on-four, though this gets old pretty quickly -- well, unless you customize your car with a pirate flag, purple boost smoke, and a sombrero. That's just funny.			",157,39,5,7,5,3,19

												Rocket League is a football (soccer) game where your player is a RC car. The concept of the game is simple and very enjoyable. Even though they reccomend you to play with a controller, I found that the keyboard and mouse controls were easy to use so I did'nt bothered playing with a controller. There are ALOT of car customisation so you can make your own car look unique and unlock more items as you level up. Multiplayer is fun. There is a casual mode where you play for fun in 1v1 2v2 3v3 and 4v4. And if you are a competitive person there is a ranked mode where you can play 1v1 2v2 and 3v3. Single player consists of quickmatch with the A.I or local and a season mode. Season mode is well detailed, you can choose your team, how many players per team, how long the season will be and more. Also you can adjust difficulty as you play. There is something for everyone in this game. For a 21$ game it looks amazing the details on the grass and the environment is amazing and it runs smoothly. If you are looking for a fast paced arcade game or if you are a football (soccer) fan, I defenitly reccomend you to buy it!			",39,15,1,8,2,0,0

												Althought incredibly fun this game has two huge issues.The matchmaking is poor, facing the same opponent or having the same teammates in ranked is awful! Especially as one of the communities many trolls is always the one you get put with twice in a row (this occurs frequently).Onto the trolls... The report system is obviously fake. The game is full of them and running into some of the same guys constantly proves no banning takes place.They could at least not matchmake you with someone you just reported...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ti piacciono le macchine? Ti piace il calcio? Compra Rocket League.Un gioco davvero estremamente divertente, sia giocato con amici sia in singolo online. Non c'è molto da recensire, il gameplay è intuitivo e strutturato molto bene, sono presenti molte macchine (alcune a pagamento tramite dei DLC) oltre a diversi campi; disponibile anche la modalità Hockey su ghiaccio e Basketball. Si può giocare da un minimo di 1v1 ad un massimo di 4v4, sia competitivo sia for fun. La personalizzazione delle vetture è vastissima, cappellini, occhialini, scie di NOS, colori, bandierine e molto altro. Ho storto un po' il naso quando hanno introdotto le casse (1.49€ l'una) ma vabbè, resta comunque un titolo quasi perfetto.Io personalmente trovo Rocket League super competitivo, e come ogni gioco competitivo che si rispetti, partono santi ad ogni gol subito, specialmente se ci si ritrova in squadra gente che gioca totalmente a caso. Have fun!			",66,12,2,6,3,0,2

												So.... You control a car, your goal is to hit a soccer ball into the opponent's goal. Physics! It isn't just any car though, you can flip, use a nitrous boost. and while being on a team of up to 4 people you have a damn grand time setting up shots and delivering, what's more, matches are only 5 minutes long, (aside from the time spent watching goal replays and the countdown back to the game) so you can hop in, have a quick game, hop out, or even hop out mid game and join games in progress...It's not very easy to explain the thrill of this game, it's something that needs to be experienced first hand in order to understand fully, I definitely recommend this game for anyone who likes physic based games along with teamwork.

												I've sunk many hours into this game and for the most part, I thought it was great. A year ago the game was great. Today, not so much, and today I would not recommend it to a friend? Why? Psyonix's servers have gone to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Rocket League is a fast action game where split second actions determine who wins and loses. This is a game that cannot be played with lag.A year ago everything ran smoothly. Today my friends and I are having significant difficulties with USE servers. It's to the point where the game is tremendously frustrating. On your screen you hit the ball left, but a second later you see you didn't in fact touch the ball at all. During off-peak hours the game is better (Sunday mornings, for example), but during most of the gameplay during the week I end up rage quitting over constant lag issues causing me to be an ineffective player. I am not enjoying the game anymore. My friends aren't enjoying the game anymore.I suppose Psyonix haven't been able to keep up with the growing popularity of the game and have let the quality of their servers slip. I would not recommend this game to a friend with their current service.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I used to love this game and play it daily until the Neo-Tokyo patch, and here's why:I'm ranked Expert in this game currently, but am only really as good as most Veterans.I got my girlfriend the game in the summer sale, and play it with her on a smurf account that is ranked Pro, she is Semi-pro currently.Unfortunately matchmaking is so bad that we can't have a good game and she doesn't really get the opportunity to play with people of a similar skill level to the learn the game, as the big recent patch appears to have completely f*cked up matchmaking. We will join a usual 3v3, and will end up with a team that is Me (Pro), her (Semi-Pro) and a random (Veteran etc.) and then will be against a team with an Expert, or a Legend and an Expert, and even Rocketeer ranked people.Just now I was playing this with her with our team comp as Pro, Semi-Pro, and Veteran, against 3 Veterans. We were winning 3-0 as our teamwork was pretty good. One player leaves on the other team, and someone hiding his rank replaces him. This guy then proceeds to juggle the ball 3 times in the air before scoring and just generally being very skilled in the air, and then goes on to beat us 4-3 (all the while my girlfriend is still only just learning to hit off the wall and very occassionally has the guts to try an aerial). So thanks to matchmaking the opposition gets an insanely good player who carries them, and as such we lose the game.Now this is not just some system that recognises that I am very good for my smurf rank and so giving me decent competition. Even when I play on this main account (as I said earlier I am expert rank), I have very often been put against teams made up of semi-pros and pros while having veteran team mates, and the newbies have been absolutely slaughtered, making me feel extremely guilty that they have had to come against such an unfair team.All-in-all, if you are already experienced at this game, you will tend to have fun, maybe have some stupidly easy games thanks to poor matchmaking. If you are new to the game or looking to get it for the first time and will need to learn the ropes of wallcrawling, aerials etc. then just don't bother until matchmaking is fixed, as you will just get annihilated and frustrated that you aren't being given the chance to learn the game amongst people of a similar skill level.

												Good, but very poor network optimizationThe game is fun, but playing online takes up more than 1 Mbps for only 1v1. This is VERY poor network optimization, as ideally every network update whould only have to send 12 floats + 1 boolean (49 or 97 bytes depending on the float precision, plus network buffers) per car, then another 12 floats for the ball itself, leading to a grand total of only 146 or 290 bytes for the cars and ball, for the data sent from the server to the client every update. I figure 20 every second should be plenty - thats only 2920 bytes or 5800 bytes a second - 23 Kbps or 46 Kbps. then you only need to send a 2-byte packet every time the state of a boost pad changes, and then a packet for chat every time a message is sent. You should EASILY be able to play online with only a 512 Kbps connection. But it struggles on a 3Mbps connection with 1 other person browsing the web. PLEASE OPTIMIZE NETWORK USAGE.

												Rocket League is sports game with cars, but will you want to play it ?Rocket League is a very simple arcadey sports game. You control an RC car and you play football with other people. It's as simple as it sounds and some matches could become incredibly intense.Gameplay is simple. You control an RC car and you play football. You have a nitro button to go faster and a jump button to save or attack. It's really simple and you get used to it really fast, you won't have trouble at all.Graphic's are awesome. It has a lot of color, some of the arena's are awesome and look incredible and not to mention the car's. They all look awesome and you can customize them, like adding decals, hats and antenna's. Soundtrack is awesome and the sound design is awesome. Everything from the car sounds to the crowd cheering it's all amazing, all the little details are just awesome.When you play single player the AI is incredibly easy as they AI is incredibly stupid. The only hard thing is unfair mode where you can choose 1v2, 1v3 or 1v4 and all of the are really hard.You can play this game for 100 hours and not get sick of it. The game is incredibly fun. It's one of those games you can always play as a side game and you will always want to play one more match after you've played it.The game doesn't have many bugs. The only bad thing is sometimes the ping would rise to 300 even though my internet is fine.Rocket League is a incredibly fun game and without a doubt a must own for anyone. I had tons of fun playing it and I see myself playing more in the future. The game has tons of modes like 1v1 2v2 3v3 4v4 and the unfair mode mentioned earlier. If you have friends this game is also a really great game to play with them. Rocket League is one of my favorite games that came out in recent memory. It's a great little title and a must own for everyone. I give Rocket League 9.5/10			",904,350,32,94,59,7,85

												Game is Great.  The EULA is stupid.  In this day and age the publishers that be think that template EULAs should be used on all platforms.Publishers,The EULA, that was added on 2016/09/08, states that I (the consumer) cannot use the license on more than one PC even though I own a license to use it on the PC platform. Compare section 2(1) against section 5.1.b.  In otherwords you are trying to make the license be bound to 1 computer.  Section 2(1) makes sense in that I have a license on/with a single platform.  But section 5.1.b does NOT make sense in this day and age.  Espectially when the distribution platform is Steam.  Steam controls/limits only 1 active/running game at a time. AND when the game is paired with Steam Cloud which easily migrates saves between one computer and another I cannot believe that you added section 5.1.b.*#2) is that a EULA was added POST-SALE. I was not presented with a EULA at the time of sale therefor one CANNOT be added after the fact especially when it bans my use of the software if I don't agree to the license. e.g. I should not be able to use the newly patched version but I should be able to use the version prior to the patch that added the EULA in-game. Also I have no recourse, on the Steam platform, to use the previous version that did not require the EULA. (Steam's backup system doesn't work like a traditional backup system.)#3) Also Psyonix in section 6(7) says they can decide if your account loses access to VC/VG with no mention of any recourse the consumer can take to refute the claim. e.g. they are the police, judge and executioner.#4) Lastly Psyonix is specifically removing a right Californian's have. See the bottom of section 8. Thus this cannot be good for the consumer if they are removing a consumer right.All in all this was a bad move by Psyonix. It is a bait and switch licensing in terms of #2. You cannot even exit the software without agreeing to the license (unless you use Task Manager. You cannot even use Windows' ALT-F4). That seems a bit illegal doesn't it?*Post updated on 2016/09/09 0207 because I re-read the EULA and it indeed says 'at the same time'  I swear it wasn't there the 1st time I read it.  I apologize.

												Who doesn't want to drive RC cars and run into things ? Everything about the cars are just crazy from the customisations to the turbo boost you can change everything to personalize the car . You have to play offense and defense in the game getting the timing of the ball down is a little tricky but smashing into your opponent making that game changing save is sweeeet  !  I would definitely recommend this game to others			",43,1,5,0,4,0,3

												Uninstalled.New EULA is a joke and ♥♥♥♥♥ all over us, introduced Microtransactions because they couldn't make any decent DLC. There's a huge stigma about microtransactions in games, especially in a game you paid for, it's understandable from a F2P game, they need some sort of income to keep the game free and to keep making content, But when a game you buy decides to pack up some little DLC's into various crates and gives you the chance at getting the particular DLC you want, that's dirty. What could've become more DLC is now locked behind a freemium gambling paywall, with the real DLC I could chose what I wanted and happily pay for it, now I'd have to buy a key, then use that key on a crate, and hope that I get the item I wanted, if not, I'd have to buy another key, potentially spending more money on useless items, than I would on an actual DLC pack I actually wanted, not fun.This game was fantastic, the graphics, the feel, the cross-platform, now it's just another soon-to-be F2P money ♥♥♥♥♥.To sum up the EULA, Psysonix has complete control over you, they can sell your data on, They can take the game away from you and deny you access for life if they see fit. I'm not even going to mention that they deny access to the game unless you agree to their new EULA... oops. ♥♥♥♥ you Psyonix.Absolutely Disgusted.EDIT: I made a few mistakes when reading the EULA, review has been changed, the game is still going in a bad direction though.

												Cool game ruined by match making.  Pros-Lots of fun when you're evenly matched-Easy to get started but difficult to master-Lots and lots of stuff to earn-Nice leveling system with cosmetic rewardsCons-Match Making is awful-Did I mention how bad the match making is? -Constantly queued against people who are leagues ahead of your skill set. One really good player can completely wreck a game of newbies. -A high level player can queue with his brand new friend and it puts them in the low players MMR so the high level player just wrecks everyone.  Results in really lopsided games. -No penalties for leaving games so people quit constantly resulting in lopsided games with AI controlled players. Seriously people quit after the first goal is scored when there is still 3 minutes left in the game. So weird. Until they fix the match making and punish leavers this game will continue to be extremely frustrating.			",11,0,0,5,0,0,0

												Pros:-infinite play value-VERY high skill ceiling-stays fun and entertaining even after a while-even better with friends-co-op oriented. You can chain devastating and hilarious plays with a little bit of teamwork-friendly community-newcommer-friendly, easy to start and have fun early-very smooth and refreshing gameplay-well optimized, stutterless yet beautiful graphicsCons:-sometimes uneven matchmaking. You might be matched with people who are way too strong or too weak for you-newcommers tend to forget teamplay-might become a bit frustrating if your team lacks synergy I recommend this game. If you don't know what to play in your steam library, there's still Rocket League. Also, bring your friends into it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game to get into, fun at first and turns competitive when you get good enough.Rocket league is highly versitle with each game being different from the next, if you're ever bored this is a great game to play casually. Starting out you'll find every player who is better than you utterly amazing and gaze in awe and won't even remember losing cause you were too focused on their sick aerial. You'll also laugh uncontrollably for each new physic breaking move you see. In short, its a good game for those who are looking for a good time whether you play casually or competitively.

PRESENTATIONRocket League has all the polish of a full triple A release, but still with the price point of a normal indie game. Unreal engine 4 makes this game an absolute joy to look at while also still being relatively easy to run. The texture quality is gorgeous, down to every last car and stadium. The environments are quite amazing to look at, they do a great job of immersing you in the match. Combine that with the sound design of the cars and the crowds, and you actually start to think you are inside of the arena driving the car. This game also has some of the best particle effects I’ve seen in a game. Every spark, every engine trail effect, and there are a lot of them, just look amazing. This is easily the best looking game I’ve seen this year, and definitely up there for best looking games I’ve ever seen. CONTENTRocket League has enough content to keep entertained for a long, long time. With seemingly endless amounts of ways to customize your car including decals, boost trails, paint colors, types of paint, wheels, HATS, and antennas. Add all of those with a good selection of cars, you can have millions of different combinations. I’ve been playing this game for a long time and I still haven’t unlocked everything in the game. Another great thing this game offers is competent AI to play against. Rookie mode gives you an excellent way to practice at the game, while All-star mode gives a challenge to the experienced Rocket League players. Pick your team in season mode or grab some friends to play online, and be entertained for hours. GAMEPLAYRocket League is a very unique game by nature. There are certainly not a lot of car soccer games, especially not with boost power-ups and jumping cars. Even though there aren’t a lot of games like it, Rocket League nailed their gameplay. It’s an arcade racer at heart, which is perfect for the fast paced action of the game. The cars handle very well, on the ground, gliding on the walls, or in the air.  The gameplay can be very tactical and team based at times. You have to utilize your boost at the right time, you have to make sure you get the right angle on your shots and passes or they will go in every direction but the one you meant. Teamwork is incredibly useful, it’s the difference between winning big and losing big. The gameplay also takes some unique twist when you add or take away players. You can have 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4 or even an unfair mode where you play by yourself against multiple AI players. Overall this game is incredible fun to play with friends or by yourself.

												Rocket League must be one of the few games released this year that I can recommend with almost no embarrassment nor awkwardness. So, it's not cringeworthy, then what is it?Rocket League is mostly about having casual fun driving cars with nitrous. The goal in the game is to actually make a goal. With a ball. So, football with cars, 'eh? It might sound a tad lame or somewhat ridiculous idea but trust me. It works, somewhat. The game was made in about couple weeks time by a couple of handless monkeys and an orangutan. You can always get the best out of the game by buying the newest DLC's (read ""cars"") and going nuts with the biggest and baddest hit registers that money can buy. Also, don't forget to tag along your rabbit foot, if you don't know how to play, don't ya worry kid! Just smack the ball as fast as you can, and wait for the goal, it'll go there.As always, the game is ridden with Polish, Russian and other ""bugs"" who like to get busy with your hiney, with a telephone pole. It's not half as bad as CS:GO or DoTA2, but still, very inconvenient for the rest of the world.Pros- Semi-good servers in EU - Oceania - US- Cartoony graphics- Fun to play- Easy to learnCons- Some of the servers lag. A lot.- Matchmaking needs country limitations.- No anti-cheat (first cheats are appearing as you read this)All in all, it's a pretty decent game as long as you play with your friends. 3.5/5 ",211,24,10,18,26,1,29

												Beauty in simplicity - that's how you can describe Rocket League in one sentence. This game is just about playing football with cars, it's fun and it's extremely addictive. Also, a lot of stuff is still added to the game (some free, some as DLC), like new game modes (Snow Day, Hoops, Rumble), new cars, standard items, painted and certified items etc. The only thing i would say is bad in Rocket League is that the developers adding non-standard maps into standard playlists and they don't care about that it changes the gameplay and majority of the players don't like those maps. It would be best if there were separate playlists with standard and non-standard maps for all modes. I'm sure it would make both sides (those who like non-standard maps and those who doesn't) happy. Unfortunately the developers still don't want to hear about this, hopefully they will in the future. But this is really the only thing i found that i don't like in Rocket League, there is nothing else, all other things are positive so i definitely recommend this game. Also, nominated for the ""Just 5 More Minutes"" award :D. Result: 9,9/10 (just because of those non-standard maps, otherwise it would be 10/10)			",19,1,1,0,1,0,0

												Pros:-infinite play value-VERY high skill ceiling-stays fun and entertaining even after a while-even better with friends-co-op oriented. You can chain devastating and hilarious plays with a little bit of teamwork-friendly community-newcommer-friendly, easy to start and have fun early-very smooth and refreshing gameplay-well optimized, stutterless yet beautiful graphicsCons:-sometimes uneven matchmaking. You might be matched with people who are way too strong or too weak for you-newcommers tend to forget teamplay-might become a bit frustrating if your team lacks synergy I recommend this game. If you don't know what to play in your steam library, there's still Rocket League. Also, bring your friends into it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Think i've found my Best Game Of 2015 right here, everythings great about this game, can't praise the devs enough, everything they've done is great, nothing is pay to win, they've listened to community feedback and made adjustments to the game based on that feedback, not buying the DLC's wont exclude you from any matchmaking, it's all just perfect.

WE LOST BUT I DON'T CARE THIS GAME IS AWESOME!And then when you start to understand the game a little bit:Come on buddy, make it a goal. Naahh it's OK, close one.Yey! We won. Good job guys.When you become a pro:*Teammate scores*Nice Shot!Nice Shot!Nice Shot!Chat disabled for 4 seconds.*Teammates fails to save a goal*What a save!What a save!What a save!Chat disabled for 4 seconds.And i enjoyed every step of it.

												First of all, this is a very fun game. You can easily put hours into Rocket League. I enjoy seeing the new cars/decals/flags  they release even though you have to pay for some of them. You know, I wouldnt mind them releasing a car pack for free every now and then but this game is fairly new (2 months or so). This game can get very competitive very quickly with ranked matches or even just against bots. Cant wait to see what comes next!			",160,17,7,16,16,1,20

I wish I could be good, and I probably would enjoy this a lot, but I can't.That aside, this game is an amazing example of great design. This game has a great balance between simple to understand mechanics (as it is based on soccer, a simple game that most people know the basic goal of), and tricky manuevers and strategy that reward skillful players.

												Rocket League is an action-packed funfest that is easy to play and difficult to master. Everyone can jump in right away and have fun with this title which is something like a combination of RC Racing and soccer (football). Never dull and extreme fun to play with friends Rocket League makes a great party game as well as a nice game to relax in when taking a break from more complex games. It brings the best of what makes console games fun to the PC. I recommend playing this title with a controller for maximum enjoyment.

			Rocket League is a fantastic fast-paced action game which is essentially football with cars. Anything can happen in the stadium and often does!

This is the funnest game to play among friends and on your own. It requires amazingly high level of skill to improve which makes it challenging enough to never stop.Highly recommend to anyone looking for a game changing experience.Patzr .~			",5,0,1,0,0,0,0

												I played this during the free weekend, because I was honestly sure I wouldn't like it.But hot digity damn, this game is addictive!!I will say as many others have said before me: This game feels more like football than football games.Because you control one character, yourself! And you have to set up goal chances for your teammates and dribble like nobody's business!I don't usually enjoy football either IRL or in games like FIFA, but this game can be enjoyed by anyone, doesn't matter if you're not into sports. I will say that knowing the way to set up goal chances as they actually do in real football games really help, and just knowing how to move around at all.During the free weekend, I went on skype with a friend, and all off a sudden we had played for over four hours.You will most likley just keep playing game after game after game.And the server search is so ♥♥♥♥ing fast you won't have time to sip from your drink between matches!All in all, love this game!It's extremly fun to play with friends while communicating.Hectic and hella fun!PS: When I say ""football"" I of course mean the real football, not Hand-egg.

One of the best games I've EVER played. I never get bored of it, and it's amazing to see how well you progress. You'll be whiffing and wondering how the hell you hit the ball in the air, then you realize hey i can actually kind of jump hit it. Then you start to add some boost and however many hours later you can aerial. That's just one of the many simple examples of skill progression in this game that keep you addicted.And then you add friends to form a team of your own to go against others in competitive, or if you're just looking for leisurely play, there's casual. It becomes a world of fun no matter what you decide to do in this game, and i find myself playing it every chance i have some free time.11/10 gg ez ",37,7,0,7,5,1,2

												It's football (or soccer, depending on how you like to call it)... With cars! I mean, what more could you wish for?This is a great game for both the casual player and the one willing to invest hundreds of hours into mastering every single aspect of this game. The classic ""easy to learn, hard to master"" experience.It has a working online match-making system for teams with up to 4 players, which never lets you wait for your match for longer than half a minute. But there is also a season mode for the single player experience as well as split-screen coop, both online and local only, for up to 4 players, which already is a sensation on its own for today's gaming standards.And as if this was not enough already, the game also properly works. It is kind of sad that one has to congratulate a game developer for making a proper, finished game - but judging by the flood of early-access-pre-alpha-beta-not-finished games that pop up everywhere, one has to really compliment Psyonix for releasing a game that is as well polished as Rocket League is. You are likely to never run into a game-breaking bug, or any bug at all, and Psyonix did a great job of getting the best performance and quality out of the Unreal 3 engine.To sum it all up: I can really recommend Rocket League. The game works flawlessly and is great fun for everyone who is just remotely into competetive online gaming.			",515,77,15,51,41,6,79

												If you are looking for a very addictive hard to put down game then this is most likely going to make you♥♥♥♥♥♥bricks. the simple but so well construced concept of car soccer with rocket power is what makes this game shine, i havent had any problems with match making yet (will update if so) and the community is alround pretty good i mean you are always going to get the guy that dosent understand what push to talk is and has his AC on fullblast and thinks that he is mlg pro but you get that anywhere. can not recomened this enough PLAY WITH A CONTROLLER!!!! its how this game is meant to be played, and no the keyboard and mouse controlls are not ""good enough"" to get the maximum enjoyment and playabilty out of rocket league use a controller.

												11/10, this game will be the next E-Sport.Have you ever wanted to play soccer in a rocket powered car, while being able to floor it into the other team and blow them up? Then this is the game for you! With easy controls, short matches, and just an overall fun experience, this game will slowly suck your social life away!Pros:Insanly addictive. You are unable to stop playing this game.Matches are only 5 minutes, a little bit more if you hit overtime.Easy to learn, but difficult to master the harder techniques.Controls are easy, and intuitive.The super simple tutorial makes the super simple controls even easier.Community is awesome.Cons:It's slowly sucking away my soul.Every once in a while you get connected to an iffy server, but even then it's not too bad.

 So simple, so entertaing and SO MUCH FUN! This game recreates the fun you get playing the ball sports. You will find yourself enjoying close matches, getting a lot of adrenaline rush in intense situations and just liking the simplicity of the game.The quick chat options are great and brings more people together. The only downside is that beside the multiplayer there is nothing much to do in singleplayer. Nonetheless, this game is worth trying out.			",70,15,8,6,3,1,11

Product received for free
												i got this game for free with the steam controller a year and couple months as of writing this review.  i repurchased the game for ps4 also, because of the fact that most of my friends have a ps4 and not a gaming pc, either way, i love this game and have donned the moniker of Marty McFly because of this game.  it's the most unique game i've ever played.  i dont like traditional sports games, this is in a league of its own.  if anything it's the same feeling i got when i played tribes 2 or tribes vengeance.  not that the gameplay is similar, but the feeling you get from someone besting you in a 3d arena, there are no limits to how good you can get, and also how bad you can make a mistake.  even after how many hours i've dumped into this game, i still want to play it as much as the first week i tried it.  and to think i would have missed out on this game just because i dont normally like sports games, or racing games. probably the most timeless, competetive, difficult to learn, instant classic game, that is by far in my favorites for the rest of my life for sure.  the only gripe i have with this game is the fact that SOME of the players have a toxic attitude, but most of the actual good players are nice and respectful.  just keep playing, it's all experience and realizing where you made a mistake and correcting bad habbits, there are great aspects to this game also, it really puts me in a zen mindstate also.  i could just be in practice hitting the ball around and talk on the phone with someone. theres something euphoric and satisfying about this game, and i am extremely addicted. lol			",104,23,0,26,12,0,22

												I definitely recommend this game to anyone. Even if you’re playing by yourself, however the servers can be a complete joke making the games extremely laggy and making it near to impossible to line up the perfect shot (This really needs to be fixed by the way). Besides from the servers the game is perfect and really great fun when playing with friends. There is even a ranking system for those obsessed with progression. And casual games for those who enjoy repetition. The best part however is seeing yourself improve game after game and customising your ride. Overall great game. I can see alot of potential with this game as its community is constently growing and im glad to be part of it.			",99,13,0,7,10,0,3

												This game is a blast.  I wasn't sure if I would like it because I am not a soccer fan, but I was looking for something for my wife and I to co-op together, and she hates soccer and car games so it took some convincing.You know what, she loves it!  We played for 3.5 hours last night and we can't wait to play again today.  It is so much fun.  We are playing with her and I on the same team against bots and it is a blast.  The sound is great and the colors are very colorful, and the game runs great on mid range hardware.Even if this game does not look fun to you, I suggest you buy it and give it a shot.  You will not be disappointed. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Addicted!  I used to play a game called Monster Truck Madness 64 on the Nintendo 64 where you could play soccer and hockey with monster trucks.  The mechanics were obviously what you'd expect from an N64 game, but it was fun.  This game took it to a whole new level.I love the competitiveness in the game.  I like that you can cross play with PS4 players (although I wish you could party with PS4 players).  Controller support is great!  I have a lot of friends that play the game.One thing I think they could really work on is the lag compensation.  There can be really bad rubberbanding if there is lag.			",159,15,8,6,13,3,23

												Absolutely love this game. At first I thought the game might end up being rather repetitive, but is hasnt. True, the game follows the same principle every game, a ball, the enemy goal and go kick it in. But the amazing thing about this game is that there is always more to learn, more epic stuff to do. The feeling that you get when you pull of your first aerial goal is amazing. It might not look like it on first glance, but the possibilities in this game are near endless. I suggest you give it a shot and dont be discouraged if you cant pull of that aerial in your first 10 hours of playtime. Only negative thing I would say about this game are the newer maps they have released. They tend to be just a little different then the ones you have gotten used to. A little bigger, a little smaller, the floor not being even. Or in the case of the Neo Tokyo map, just a totally different design. It basically screws over all the things you have learned when playing those maps.			",109,7,2,14,15,1,18

												It is Rocket RC Cars meets Soccer..  and don't forget the explosions It doesn't matter if you play soccer games or not, this game takes it to a totally new level. Competitive, fun, and chaotic  gameplay experience. Play with friends in private match up to 8 players in the party, friendly or competitive match ups you chose, go ranked or social with friends against others, or go solo.. It is all up to you. Smooth controls, hard to master (especially camera controls); but you know what they say ""Practice makes perfect"".  Recommendation: Use a controllerWide range of car customizations, large collection of items to unlock. Overall gameplay graphics are great.  Physics and Explosions.. You have to get that angle right and be careful those explosion will throw you and the ball off your course. A Must buy to all,  time and money  well  spent :D :P   Don't forget to save that replay    ",70,67,0,2,5,0,0

												This is a quick-to-learn game that lets you play fast and challenging matches without the need for a long training. Of course, it is plenty of extremely skilled players, and playing against those players is sometimes very frustrating. Nevertheless, the usual learning curve is pretty satisfactory.There are lots of options for customizing cars, and several game options as well. This game keeps people very concentrated, but it asks for experience more than for strategy and hard-thinking.			",73,4,1,3,7,1,13

												Being a huge fan of millitary simulators like Arma and Squad, I don't generally play arcade style games like this. When this game came out my current Arma Exile partner dropped out and started playing Rocket League. Looked like the dumbest waste of time and money I ever witnessed compared to the complexity of a game like Arma 3. However I bought it on steam just to see what the hype was. Then I got a new fulltime job and PC gaming time was limited. Could not play 4-6 hour sessions on Arma anymore. While I began to get a feel for it I was starting to slowing let it grow on me. Now, as I am rank Master, it's nearly a daily play for me with alot of friends. I have steamlink and extra controllers to play with friends at the house on the big TV and it's by far the most fun yet competitive game I have ever played. Side note: I strongly, strongly HATE CS:GO			",157,31,23,15,31,1,8

												I play this game to wind down and just chill out. I use a controller, slouch in my chair and listen to my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ playlist on Soundcloud for half an hour. I play this game very casually and not that often, but it's fun, rewarding, good for co-op and playing with friends. Lot's of customisation which is nice, cars, wheels, paintjobs, hats and things can add a bit of humour and more content is always nice. Competitively it's still fun, I just don't enjoy that side of this game as I don't play it that way.All in all, great game, looks nice, feels nice, is nice. Buy it.Pros:>Looks nice>Relaxing (Unranked)>Good physics>Loads of customisation>FunCons:>Can't really think of anything bad, all round it's pretty damn good. Vote up.			",93,5,15,4,21,0,4

												It seems like such a little kid game: whacky looking racecars hitting a soccer ball. But my one friend had about 80 hours of play time and insisted that it was a great game. So did everyone else within the massive amount of positive reviews. Also, I hadn't played a car driving game in a while. With that said, I added it to my wishlist and the moment it went on sale I bought it.Here I am now with over 100 hours of play time that FLEW by.Beautiful clean graphics and game menus. Crystal clear audio with fun electronic songs when in menu. Playing with friends has always worked perfectly for me, whether online or split screen. Believe it or not I prefer playing with the keyboard, but the Xbox 360 controller works great, as does the PS4 controller. I love playing with friends but it's very fun going solo as well, and I don't say that often. Many ""hats"" and ""antennas"" to style your car with. Many paint types and colors to style your car with. A decent amount of cars to pick from. A decent amount of arenas and game modes to choose from, or create your own rules in your own arena and invite friends. If you don't have any friends the game's bots work well, although they are pretty easy even when set to their hardest difficulty. I'd equate the bots on ""All-Star"" to a real player who is around ""Semi-Pro"". There is an exp point system and leveling up, but it doesn't do anything other than change the status displayed underneath your name such as ""Rookie, Semi-Pro, Pro, Veteran, Expert, Master, Legend"" of which you can opt out of displaying. There are multiple camera options (can be very helpful) and graphics options. There are multiple servers in many regions, and you can toggle which regions to connect to. Also, the developers keep the game updated and release both free and purchasable content from time to time.The game itself is soccer but with cars. Cars that can jump! And if you are good enough, cars that can even fly haha. There are boost pads that speed you up and you can use the boost to ""aerial"" as well. Cool side-note: This is the first game for PC that is cross-platform with both Xbox One and Playstation 4 players. If you are playing a match and notice someone's picture says ""PSY NET"" that means that they are using a console.Not much else to say other than try this game out for yourself!			",47,6,0,3,2,0,2

												It's football -or soccer for the muricans- with cars! This game makes me incredibly moist. And to top it off, the optimisation is good. It's just a bundle of joy, really. Unless you're getting ♥♥♥♥ing stomped by the opposing team... Then it kinda just ruins your day.			",140,27,1,16,11,1,16

												If you're like me and you hate sports (football especially), purely because of how its evolved from a semi-serious thing into a soap opera that takes place on a muddy field starring stuck up millionaires prancing about in short shorts, and you also happen to like video games that are more fleshed out than you think, then rocket league is for you.Granted, rocket league is aimed at everyone, even the people who hate football (or soccer, for you foreigners). At first glance, you may say ""its just football with cars"", but its so much more than that. Sure, it has the basic premise as football, but you cant fly through the air using supersized thrusters, while doing a pirouette and hit the ball in mid air into the goal in real life can you?Rocket league features a satisfying customisation option that allows you to change the look of your car (of which there's many). You can change the primary colour, secondary colour, decal, trims, type of coating, antenna topper and even have hats on the roof. Not to mention the generous variety of cars they give you right off the bat, all of which have their own separate decals.However, as much as I love a good customisation screen, the gameplay is where rocket league thrives. Its easy to pick up and start playing, but its extremely hard to master, and when you first enter the pitch, you may even find yourself scoring goals already. This isn't even half of the gameplay. Using your thrusters, you can pull of bafflingly graceful tricks such as aerial pirouettes, juggles and even mid air bicycle hits (if you know what you're doing). These skills will develop the more you play, and teaching yourself how to do aerials is half the fun.Rocket league also supplies you with the necessary modes to assist in practicing said skills. It has aerial training, striker training and goalkeeper training, and more, all of which come in several difficulties to truly push you.Rocket league has a separate mode for competitive play. This is different from the normal casual match, as you'll be ranked based on your performance. If you're familiar with CSGO's competitive mode, then you'll know the ins and outs already. The gist is, you play 10 matches, and based on your performance in said matches you'll be ranked. You'll also reap rewards at the end of the season, these include crowns, thruster trails among other things.There's also a seasons mode that's separate to the other modes, where you face off against bots in a season. These bots have a team name, some of which I found amusing, and also want the winning cup as much as you do. It was fun, but once I did it once, I didn't end up coming back to it. For beginners however, its a marvelous way to practice.I think that rocket league a special game, one that doesn't come around often, but when it does, it hits the stores hard. The DLC (that provides no advantage to buyers whatsoever) is something that I frown upon. Its mainly because I never like DLC, and think its just another money grabbing gag (I'm looking at you activision and EA), but its a great way to support psyonix and rocket league itself. Some of the skins in the DLC are quite nice too, with the same amount of detail that went into the originals. These usually come with cosmetics too, so you get a plentiful amount of loot for your money.All in all, I think rocket league should be something everyone should play at some point. It's an ingenious idea that blends two ridiculous ideas together and it somehow works. Buy it. Play it. Learn its ways. Enjoy it. It truly is something to behold, whether you play it with friends or you play it solo, its guaranteed to satisfy you.tl:dr football isn't good, footballs with cars is good. Buy rocket league.

												Over 250 hours in now, and this is still the game that keeps giving. I don't see myself stopping soon. Whatever price this game happens to be, it's more than worth it.This is the kind of game you go to play 10 minutes of and wind up playing until 3AM when you should have been in bed hours ago. It is now the only game I play consistently, and it is consistently fun, never a chore.As a bonus, Psyonix are some of the coolest devs around. Most of their updates have been great so far, and it looks like they'll continue to be that way. They listen to their fans.The only complaint I have at the moment is that the report button seems to do nothing. It's a minor complaint.			",156,43,2,9,9,3,10

												This game is a blast.

We played for 3.5 hours last night and we can't wait to play again today.  It is so much fun.  We are playing with her and I on the same team against bots and it is a blast.  The sound is great and the colors are very colorful, and the game runs great on mid range hardware.Even if this game does not look fun to you, I suggest you buy it and give it a shot.

												EDIT: Even after all this time, this game is still pretty damn fun. Although I haven't had much time to play it lately, I still think about playing it whenever winter breaks comes. Seriously. One of the best games I have ever played.This game is absolutely fun, even if you don't like sports (like me). Especially with the latest update (called Rumble, which introduces Mario-Kart-esque power-ups), this game can easily appeal to a very wide audience.Basically, it's soccer with cars, but it has so much potential for really great, funny moments, as well as several modes (including hockey, basketball, and Rumble). Play with your friends, play with strangers, play with bots. It's totally up to you.			",76,10,3,14,14,0,9

												This is a brilliant game, and it has the perfect micro-transaction model as the items you get from the crates are not pay to win, and are instead cosmetic. In addition, the update has established an economy for rocket league, so you can trade others crates for keys, meaning you don't even need to pay to get keys. In addition, all non-decal items in crates are worth >1 key, so there is a large possibility to make back your investment.			",93,17,2,9,5,0,7

												I played Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars back when that came out, so when I saw that they made a new one, I was pretty stoked. I got it for free on the PS4 and because it was so freaking awesome, i decided to support them and bought the game on Steam :D No regrets!			",224,67,14,22,32,4,18

												One of the best games of the year. It's like Soccer (Football), but with cars. An easy to learn, hard to master game that will quickly turn into a timesink, but a game you can also put 10-15 minutes into before work if you're short on time as well.If you're wondering if you should buy it or not, it's worth every penny.10/10 game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you want to play a game where everything is a skillshot, then this is the game for you.If you want to play a game with (RC) cars, then this is the game for you.If you want to go fast using turbo/boost, then this is the game for you.If you want to fly with a little toy car, then this is the game for you.If you want to team up with or face your friends, then this is the game for you.If you like football without a referee, then this is the game for you.If you like games that offer splitscreen, then this is the game for you.If you like well-refined gameplay, then this is the game for you.If you like both Mario Football and Mario Kart, then this is the game for you.If you like to deny other people's goal attempts, then this is the game for you.If you like to score goals, then this is the game for you.If you can relate to most of the above, then this is definitely the game for you.

												I never was a fan of soccer games and not really too much of a fan of car games but this combination is very fun!This is a fanastic game with a very high skill cap that gives you hours of play in an increasing variety of game modes.  All added maps and game modes in patches are free to play which is pretty awesome.  They add a few small DLCs that are pretty low cost and add a few extra cars to play with and decorative items.

												Best.Game.Ever.**Edit**With almost 200 hours into this game my love for it is has not in any way dimished.I feel like i reached my peak about 195 hours ago, i can manage to pull off insane goal after goal and pretty feel and look like some kind of expert.  Then the very next game (sometimes the same one!) i can barely hit anything and am made to look like the s**t player i am!  But this rollarcoaster is what make this game so exciting to play, and the feeling when you score that backwards aeriel goal is worth a hunded flapping misses as the ball slowly slides pass you into your goal...Plus if by chance you ever did start to feel tired of the format (this hasn't happened to me as yet) then the devs bring out a new game mode so i can show miss and swear, but at leats blame the ""new"" format for it!I guess the only negative is some of the players attitudes, but then its online gaming and where isn't there an a problem with a small amount of other players and their incessant need for attention, negative or otherwise!This is almost certainly a game that will never get ""put down"" or if it does its because my thumbs and fingers have given up on life and they haven't invented some sort of head bobbing eye movment mode so i can keep missing then scoring amazing goals all in one game!

												If you're like me and you hate sports (football especially), purely because of how its evolved from a semi-serious thing into a soap opera that takes place on a muddy field starring stuck up millionaires prancing about in short shorts, and you also happen to like video games that are more fleshed out than you think, then rocket league is for you.Granted, rocket league is aimed at everyone, even the people who hate football (or soccer, for you foreigners). At first glance, you may say ""its just football with cars"", but its so much more than that. Sure, it has the basic premise as football, but you cant fly through the air using supersized thrusters, while doing a pirouette and hit the ball in mid air into the goal in real life can you?Rocket league features a satisfying customisation option that allows you to change the look of your car (of which there's many). You can change the primary colour, secondary colour, decal, trims, type of coating, antenna topper and even have hats on the roof. Not to mention the generous variety of cars they give you right off the bat, all of which have their own separate decals.However, as much as I love a good customisation screen, the gameplay is where rocket league thrives. Its easy to pick up and start playing, but its extremely hard to master, and when you first enter the pitch, you may even find yourself scoring goals already. This isn't even half of the gameplay. Using your thrusters, you can pull of bafflingly graceful tricks such as aerial pirouettes, juggles and even mid air bicycle hits (if you know what you're doing). These skills will develop the more you play, and teaching yourself how to do aerials is half the fun.Rocket league also supplies you with the necessary modes to assist in practicing said skills. It has aerial training, striker training and goalkeeper training, and more, all of which come in several difficulties to truly push you.Rocket league has a separate mode for competitive play. This is different from the normal casual match, as you'll be ranked based on your performance. If you're familiar with CSGO's competitive mode, then you'll know the ins and outs already. The gist is, you play 10 matches, and based on your performance in said matches you'll be ranked. You'll also reap rewards at the end of the season, these include crowns, thruster trails among other things.There's also a seasons mode that's separate to the other modes, where you face off against bots in a season. These bots have a team name, some of which I found amusing, and also want the winning cup as much as you do. It was fun, but once I did it once, I didn't end up coming back to it. For beginners however, its a marvelous way to practice.I think that rocket league a special game, one that doesn't come around often, but when it does, it hits the stores hard. The DLC (that provides no advantage to buyers whatsoever) is something that I frown upon. Its mainly because I never like DLC, and think its just another money grabbing gag (I'm looking at you activision and EA), but its a great way to support psyonix and rocket league itself. Some of the skins in the DLC are quite nice too, with the same amount of detail that went into the originals. These usually come with cosmetics too, so you get a plentiful amount of loot for your money.All in all, I think rocket league should be something everyone should play at some point. It's an ingenious idea that blends two ridiculous ideas together and it somehow works. Buy it. Play it. Learn its ways. Enjoy it. It truly is something to behold, whether you play it with friends or you play it solo, its guaranteed to satisfy you.tl:dr football isn't good, footballs with cars is good. Buy rocket league.

Decent soundtrack and nice looking environments/textures.I regret not getting it sooner but i'm looking forward to playing this lots in the future. great game! ",285,47,5,24,31,5,42

												Okay, this game, I can assure you that it's not for all. But for people who just want to have a little fun one late night can pick it up with a friend or two, and suddenly it's so much better. I'll point out a few pros and cons about it (that I know of, and personally think is good/bad) because a lot of people think this is the best♥♥♥♥♥♥ever. It is not. There are many games better than this. But anyway.. What this game has to offer is:- Good soundtrack. Of course not all the songs appeal to me, but most of them do, and you can just have them in the background while working on something else. IF you buy the soundtrack that is. Not all the songs are available though.- A lot of car customizations. Even without the very neat DLCs, you can still get exclusive holiday items, if you're up to farm them, which can be a little time consuming. But other than that, all the cars look good, and you can have a lot of cool and goofy styles, if that's your preference.- It's pretty-looking. Honestly, it's one of the prettiest games I've seen (imo), and I play it on the lowest of the lowest quality. I still see the beauty in the maps and how well done some of them are made.- It's fast paced. Now, some people aren't as good with fast paced games, which is why I'm mentioning it. I love me some fast games, but I'm not really sure if this is a pro or a con. It can be discussed.Now, because I've already given the pros, right up there.^ I dunno what else to put in. It's a fun game and a great experience with friends? idfkWell, the only cons I can think of right off the bat is:- The matchmaking system. Some would agree with me, some would be like ""BUH SUM PPL HEF ROOKI/VETEREN FRENDS THO"". Well y'know what? It's still trash. Honestly. I shouldn't be in a match versus a Veteran when I'm still a Pro. Same with Semi-pro honestly. Yes, the ranks doesn't mean too much, but it can get people on the nerves when they always get a bad team and the other team's much better. Etc. Etc.- It's a sports game. Even though it's not exactly like football (football with cars, wow) it's still football. For those who don't like sports game, or sports in general (except for e-sports) should avoid this. Unless you want to try out something new, that's up to you.- Hitting your own teammates. Yeahm you can hit your own teammates without any consequences, right? Except you can ♥♥♥♥ their position up and lose a point. That's just one example out of many. But I can see how it can be (a little bit) good too. You can hit your teammate in case they got no boost. But usually it just messes up their position.- Easy leveling up. Even though it might not seem like a big deal (levels don't matter) it messes up the matchmaking system, because some Pros and Veterans should play with a lower rank. Again, this can be discussed.Well, I dunno what else to add. For people who don't get the ranking system:- Rookie is the lowest rank, and the first one you'll get. (Level 1-9)- Semi-pro is a rank you get after reaching a certain level. (10-19)- Pro is another rank you'll get after reaching a certain level. (20-29)- Veteran is yet another rank you can get. (30-39)- I'm unsure of the rest of the ranks, but I'm sure there are at least two more. I'm terribly sorry!If I had to rate it though, it'd be 8.5/10. Yeah yeah, sue me, I'm just a human.

A Brief Review of Rocket League: Rocket League is an incredibly fun game based in a future of extreme sport and rocket science!Players operate powerful, rocket powered beasts as they attempt to play a game of football!Games are fun, engaging and extremly enjoyable to play with others. There are many different game modes from 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4 as well as other game mades which can apply insanly fun elements such as square footballs, lower gravity or even faster footballs.Apart from the gamemodes themeselves, players have the ability to customise their beastly cars in many different ways from body, wheels, rockets, devals, hats and antennas! The choices for customisation seem almost endless!The incorporation of DLC's also make Rocket League and fun and engaging experience for any player with added cars, maps and even more hats!All in all, for the small price of £15, Rocket League is an extremely fun game for anyone looking for a fun and entertaining experience to enjoy in their free time.

												""I hate Soccer! I hate cars! That game is stupid!"" - Me, before playing.""ANYONE WANNA PLAY ROCKET LEAGUE?!?! RRRRRRRGGGGGGH HGSFDG"" - Me after trying it.I honestly thought this game looked boring, but after trying it out for myself, I grew to LOVE IT.I reallllllly suck at being a striker, so I've been trying my best to be a good Goalie. Even though I mostly sit in the goal the entire game, it's still fun! Saving the net from enemy goals makes you feel useful!I don't think I have as much fun being on the attack, haha. I suck.

												Rocket League is one of those games that I looked at initially and said ""meh"" for the longest time. Once I finally tried it I understood the hype. Great developers paired with simple yet well done game mechanics. Easy to pick up yet hard to master. Great with friends. Definitely recommend, especially if on sale.  ",125,13,2,14,19,0,39

												Played this game for about two months now, and all I can say is I love it. No match is ever the same and there's a ton of different skill levels and ways to play. One thing that annoys me the most however, is the community. Out of EVERY game i've played Rocket League has by far the worst community for lower level players. It's riddled with afk's, people who abandon matches when they're losing, and over all just REALLY toxic people. It does get better the higher level you get and if you're able to get over it for a while, it's not THAT bad. Over all I highly recomend this game for anyone that's looking for a fun new type of mmo. I rate this game a respectable 6/10 for new players. Not that it means anything, it's just my personal rating.			",24,4,1,0,2,0,0

												I don't like football/soccer, or football/soccer games. I like Rocket League. I can see why people like football/soccer games; the team play, the atmosphere, the tactics and the fun. Rocket League takes these bits and adds Hotwheels cars instead of players. I love it, and my kids love it, which is a rare thing to achieve; to appeal equally to such different age groups. Add to that it is currently the only cross-platform game in the world, allowing PC player to play against/with console players, with no detriment to either formats. Mark my words, this game is incredibly good, and will go down in the annuls of history to be remembered for all time. In the dictionary, under the word ""Addictive""(addicting is *not* a word FYI), there is a Rocket League screenshot of the ball exploding after a goal.			",157,18,18,9,17,1,8

												Rocket League is probably the game I'm accumulating hours on the fastest. Already have 60 hours in this game and will definitely not be stopping there.  This game is amazing fun as a solo player but even better with friends. The game features a ""season"" mode intended for the solo player, although I would like to see them implement a co-op season vs the AI.Anyone with this game will and should encourage all their friends and their friends, friends to buy this amazing game and help it grow into a game even bigger than what it is!AMAZING GG well made game devs!!Edit: Now over a 1000hours into this game... And does all of the above apply? YES!! I do feel now that season mode is redundant :P... Might be because all start bots can't airial at all. Playing with or without your friends is great! Nice to mix up some gameplay with the new updates to this game like Rumble/Icehockey/Basketball.I love that the developers allow mods in the game. Obviously not for online play, but in the training section.  Mods enhance our ways to practice and this is so beneficial for the whole community.TL:DR - Amazing game. BUY IT.  Won't be dissapointed			",47,2,6,3,2,0,3

												♥♥♥♥ this game. It just makes me angry that I suck and my teammates suck. I wish I could be good, and I probably would enjoy this a lot, but I can't.That aside, this game is an amazing example of great design. This game has a great balance between simple to understand mechanics (as it is based on soccer, a simple game that most people know the basic goal of), and tricky manuevers and strategy that reward skillful players.

Posted: March 3, 2016
												Here is m honest opinion about this game.First, let me tell you about myself. I have played this game for over 160hrs, and i must say, this game is totally awesome.P.S: PROS and CONS below if you want to skip this.About the game: This game is soccer; with cars! Your car has a rocket booster in the back and you can flip your car in all directions, and if you get good at the game, you can even hit the ball in the air [called an aerial] using your rocket booster! [It's not easy to do, but practice makes perfect. P.S: I hit the ball in mid air maybe %10 of the time, which is actually good for my level]. The games are 5 minutes long, which you might think is too quick, but you are totally wrong! The game is perfect with 5 minute games. Of course, if you play privately with friends, you can change the settings to a lot of things like ball size, ball speed, car speed, the timer (5 min, 10 min, 20 min, and unlimited), and a LOT more! The maps are all gorgeous, with great graphics.* The feeling you get when making a goal is the best feeling ever. And when you make a goal that is unexpected, like an aerial goal (scoring a goal while hitting the ball in mid air), its even more amazing. For a person who has $15-$20 on them, and cant make up there mind on a game, they should definetly choose this one, [unless you dont enjoy such a type of game for some (CRAZY) reason].THE PROS:1) Great game over-all.2) The sound in-game is amazing.3) Graphics are amazing.*4) Playing with friends online is just so much fun.5) You can play 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4.6) I personally play with a mouse and keyboard, and i must say, its just as fun if you dont have a controller.7) The plays you can make in-game is just incredible (and pretty hard to do, but easily achieveable)8) And many more*You need a pretty good computer to play this game at max settings.THE CONS:1) The players in-game may get angry when you are winning them (trust me, this is very annoying)2) The talk feature isnt clear, and it is very hard to understand what a person is saying.3) You will need an ok computer to play thisgame, and if your computer is a store-bought one, like an HP, like mine, it will be very laggy when playing in 1920 x 1080 (unless you bought an exeptionally good store-bought computer)4)There is a few more issues i find with the game, however i cant get them off the top of my head at the moment.TIPS TO GET BETTER1) Watch youtube videos, here are a couple of youtubers who are good at the game, and can show you the games true potential: Kronovi, Gibbs, and you will find more on youtube by typing in Rocket League.2) DO THE TRAINING!3) Play around a lot in the free play mode!4) PRACTICE WITH FRIENDS!5) When playing for the first time that day, first play unranked, and if you win a match, then play a ranked match.6) This game isnt about becoming the best, but its mainly about having fun, try to always have that in mind.7) PRACTICE MORE!FINAL NOTES:Just do your bets to enjoy the game, while also playing seriously. The game has updates every so often, and the game just keeps getting better. Hope you enjoyed this review!			",24,2,0,2,10,0,1

												If you like tieing your fingers into knots, cursing and making sex noises, then this game is for you.Pros:- Nice car customization, a lot of things to add with some cool stat recording features.- Fun with friends, playing on your own doesn't suck aswell.- Addictive, you will feel the need to improve. You WANT to be good in this game.- No pay to win. If you have skills you will succeed.Cons:- For me, I have no servers in my country, wich means 200 ping. I can play with that ping, latency doesn't feel to hectic. But I wish sometimes there was servers for me.- If you are living with your parents I'd recommend a gag (or sound insulation in your room). You will curse the crap out of everything...and make sex noises. Trust me, I've seen this with everyone, you make weird and awful sounds while playing.- need to get insurance for your mouse and keyboard. I have a short temper though xD.This game is great fun, every cent worth it.			",61,5,0,7,9,1,20

												I'm here to tell you all about the positions in Rocket League.Striker:You're job is to score goals and keep the ball on the opponents side.But whatever you do, DON'T MISS A SHOT. You will be hated on until you want to uninstall. If you score a goal, hope you don't have that one guy who spams ""What A Save"" after every goal. You will get hate.MidField: Most People don't even know that this is a position. You're job is to keep the ball from going too far back. You want to try and set up your Strikers for goals.Unfortunately, the second you miss an Ariel or any hit, you're going to get hate.But it feels so good when you hit an Ariel. So keep calm and waste that boost.Goalie/Keeper:This is probably the most important positions in the game.You're job is to keep the ball out of your net and to clear it up to your midfielders.But be warned, the opponents, and sometimes your own team, will constantly run into you and get in your way.Missing a Save results in a goal and your opponents getting real mad at you. Oh, and don't be that guy who gets the best spawn and stays back. Just don't. Well, that's it. My review on Rocket League. Hopefully this boosts your interest in the game.-Frost.			",13,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good game. I recommend (if anyone is going to continue playing the game) that people should watch pros play the game. I learnt a lot from it. Also change your camera positioning in settings. These steps can lead anyone to becoming a master at this game.Note: Some of you may experience lag when people are joining and leaving while in match. The problem is that you may have an SSD in your PC, but the game may be installed on a HDD. If you install it on the SSD, this issue will not occur.			",57,3,1,3,6,0,3

												High-octane balls out badassery wherein there are certain plays that can only be explained by divine intervention.Update: As of this update I've just crossed the 300-hour mark and I can't say enough about how much I love this game. I'm a little put off by the implementation of crates and keys as they've ruined another game that I've put hundreds of hours in. In any case, this game has the perfect balance of easy to play hard to master, and a learning curve that is friendly to new users. Overall this game gets an easy 9/10 and remains my game of the year for 2015. A year described really well by game critic Razorfist: “The year when indie broke out, and triple A broke down.” Seriously, just buy the damn game.			",85,8,2,8,4,0,3

												This is a game with which I have arguably had the most fun! The controls are easy to get used to, and the action can really build up (I personally enjoy the initial clash after each score the most, as there's no knowing how it will play out)! Not to mention the beautiful soundtrack.This is also one of the few games that I have ever bought so much DLC Content for (Skyrim and South Park: The Stick of Truth are pretty much the only others), because I typically don't like spending the extra money. However, I've yet to come across another game that allows me to geek out like Rocket League does. Come on, where else can you dirve the Official Back to the Future Time-Machine Delorean, or the Bat-Mobile from Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice?Since I bought this game, Psyonix has added Hockey and Hoops as online servers; and as of today (June 20) they're adding Neo Tokyo (and here I am with an addictive sweet-tooth for all things Japanese), along with another arena for Rocket Labs (which I thoroughly enjoy)! I've also purchased another copy of this game to give to a friend since getting this game.I truly hope that Psyonix keeps releasing new content for this game, as it is the Only sports-style game I have ever enjoyed, and will ever play!Oh! Shoutout to #H20Delirious for getting me hooked on Rocket League!			",32,3,0,6,7,1,2

It also comes with a very neat replay editor.Besides some server issues at the time of launch (there's a ♥♥♥♥ton of players online at this moment) the game is really worth it. Also, the devs have been very quick to respond to the connection issues and they are amazing.			",176,16,11,38,21,6,30

												Now you might be thinking, is Rocket League as good as everyone says it is? Is it worth the hype? I mean after all, isn't it just soccer (footbol) with cars?Rocket League is worth every single word of praise and all the hype it's gotten. It has tons of polish, great music, lots of cosmetics, a great DLC policy (cheap DLC that gives lots of customizations that don't impact gameplay) and it has A DELOREAN TIME MACHINE (DLC, but still).If you're not convinced, Rocket League is one of the most fun multiplayer games known to man. Everything that moves can explode, from the ball to your enemy cars, and now with mutators the action will never get boring.			",128,24,2,7,9,2,9

All added maps and game modes in patches are free to play which is pretty awesome.  They add a few small DLCs that are pretty low cost and add a few extra cars to play with and decorative items.

The customization is pretty great, and has more room to expand like, adding more decals, which I would love to see, or, creating your own decals to put in the workshop or use for yourself! That would be great! The gameplay is fun, except for the fact that you can easily get ranked with people with hundreds of hours more than you and way better. Overall, it's a pretty great game and you should buy it! I totally reccomend this to any gamer that plays action games, because this game will keep you on your toes waiting for the next shot to open up...			",44,5,1,3,10,1,1

Posted: September 10, 2016
												With a total of over 600 hours played I thought it about time to write a review. While this is of course subjective based as is most reviews I hope it provides you with what you are looking for and helps you to decide if you will be purchasing this game.Common thought | Coming from mainly fps and mmo type genres I can't recall a time where I was ever interested in a sport based game in fact I dispised them. I had to be persuaded just like those I have had to persuade before they realise this is a great game that deserves a chance to prove itself. If you are like I was you have probably thrown this game out the window because you think it ""looks boring"" or ""its just soccer with cars"" and thats a shame and my goal is to help you reconsider.Match Length |Each match of Rocket League lasts 5 minutes (Custom games excluded). The match ends when the timer hits 0 and the ball hits the ground or a goal is scored. Game Modes | I will start by explaining the non-competitive (Unranked) game modes. I won't go in depth but hope to provide enough information so you get a rough idea of each one. At the time of writing this review there are 8 modes which include: Duel (1v1), Doubles (2v2), Standard (3v3), Chaos (4v4), Snow day (Ice field with a puck instead of a ball), Rocket Labs (Experimental wierd shaped maps), Hoops (Basketball court with the hoops elevated) and Rumble (A new game mode which gives players power ups every 10 seconds which can effect both the ball and other players).I personally prefer Duels and Doubles as they require more effort on my part. Standard is fine and is the most common in the pro scene however I am not a fan of that many cars on the field at one time and usually stay in goals to avoid the mayhem. 4v4 is just a cluster ♥♥♥♥ and I never play it. Snow day was fun for about 5 minutes but not something I will be going back to. Rocket Labs can be fun for some random games and provides variation from the standard maps. Hoops was also fun for about 5 minutes and I feel the court is to small and should be made larger or even the same size as the soccer field but that might come across as wierd since a basketball court is smaller then a soccer field... anyway I don't play it and won't play it again. Rumble suprised me actually. It's quite fun and its hard to predict what can happen. You opponant may shoot for goal but then the ball is frozen in mid air for a few seconds which is then saved followed by a punch which sends the ball to the other end. I will be going to Rumble when I want some variation to my game from time to time.Competitive |This is where the game gets fun however does have both pros and cons. The competitive (Ranked) game modes include Duel, Doubles, Standard and Solo Standard (3's but you queue by yourself). Ranks - A total of 10 matches are required before you will be placed into a rank. There are 4 tiers which include Prospect (Prospect 1,2,3 & Elite), Challenger (Challenger 1,2,3 & Elite), Star (Rising Star, Shooting Star, All Star & Super Star) Champion (Champion, Super Champion & Grand Champion) Each rank within a tier has 5 divisions. Once you have reached division 5 in that rank you then have a chance to move up 1 rank. PROS:1. Its hard! - Games that are easy are boring, Rocket League is a game that you progressively improve over time and there are always players at your level which means you don't always get owned. When you score a goal or win its satisfying. After 600 hours when I get a goal it still feels awesome. 2. Teamwork and Communication - Strategy is definitely something that will improve you game. Pulling off mad plays or passing at the right time then stepping our opponant to score a goal is cool as ♥♥♥♥!CONS:1. sometimes versing unfair opponants where you verse someone greatly better then yourself or a smurf which is incredibly irritating.2. The addition of the Wasteland and Tokyo maps in competitive play. I feel they shouldn't be included as the field is different then the rest of the standard maps. This means some people may get these maps more then others which I feel is unfair. Tokyo being in competitive takes it to another level. The map has elevated sides and is just rediculous. Wasteland and Tokyo should be in non competive only.Final Thought |Look the game isn't easy, it takes time to get good and a very long time to get great but don't automatically disregard the game as♥♥♥♥♥♥before you play it thats just being naive. I've read some of the negative comments on steam for Rocket League and they are a perfect example. I understand the game isn't for everyone but what I am saying is it is worth trying if you don't like it refund it. I could have continued this review and I am sure I could have written it better I haven't written many reviews. if I can update it I will later but I hope that this helps.			",54,3,2,4,4,0,2

												Got it for free with the Steam controller. I didn't think I would enjoy any kind of sports game but this one is fun to jump into for a few matches here and there. It's very simple but there's a lot of high skill tactics to learn in the long run. It'll keep you returning. I just wish it showed the avatars of pub match people. Silly that it just shows question marks for everyone...Edit: Also holy CRAP, this has the worst AI ever. The offline season mode should not even exist when you always get bot teammates that shoot the ball into your own goal CONSTANTLY. Every match feels like its me versus 5. But its also so stupid that I can shoot the ball from first-touch into the goal 9/10 times....			",500,122,11,54,26,6,76

												Pros:-infinite play value-VERY high skill ceiling-stays fun and entertaining even after a while-even better with friends-co-op oriented. You can chain devastating and hilarious plays with a little bit of teamwork-friendly community-newcommer-friendly, easy to start and have fun early-very smooth and refreshing gameplay-well optimized, stutterless yet beautiful graphicsCons:-sometimes uneven matchmaking. You might be matched with people who are way too strong or too weak for you-newcommers tend to forget teamplay-might become a bit frustrating if your team lacks synergy I recommend this game. If you don't know what to play in your steam library, there's still Rocket League. Also, bring your friends into it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rocket League is a simple concept executed very very well. If the idea of playing soccer with nitro-boosted cars sounds fun to you, then you'll probably enjoy this game. It's a lot of fun with friends, but it's also fun going solo and grouping up with random teams. The presentation is top notch. The menus are intuitive and easy to navigate. There is a tutorial mode to help you figure out the basic moves of the game. The game plays really well (as in the controls are good). The camera can take some getting used to, but it's fine. The menu soundtrack is amazing. That's a small detail but it just shows you that Psyonix really thought about each part of the game. Definitely recommended, especially with friends.Update: This is now my most played game on Steam. It's a lot of fun and Psyonix is always updating the game, whether adding DLC (it's just cosmetic stuff... different looking cars, wheels, paint, accessories, etc... you don't need to buy any of it unless you just want to) or additional modes or holiday-themed limited time items. They added a mutator mode for a while which was a lot of fun, a hockey mode for the winter, and now they've added non-standard shaped arenas in the rocket labs mode. This provides for a fresh experience as the game changes things up every now and then.TL;DR - This game is really fun. Grab it. ;)			",106,73,4,15,14,3,34

												Addicted!  I used to play a game called Monster Truck Madness 64 on the Nintendo 64 where you could play soccer and hockey with monster trucks.  The mechanics were obviously what you'd expect from an N64 game, but it was fun.  This game took it to a whole new level.I love the competitiveness in the game.  I like that you can cross play with PS4 players (although I wish you could party with PS4 players).  Controller support is great!  I have a lot of friends that play the game.One thing I think they could really work on is the lag compensation.  There can be really bad rubberbanding if there is lag.			",159,15,8,6,13,3,23

												Best.Game.Ever.**Edit**With almost 200 hours into this game my love for it is has not in any way dimished.I feel like i reached my peak about 195 hours ago, i can manage to pull off insane goal after goal and pretty feel and look like some kind of expert.  Then the very next game (sometimes the same one!) i can barely hit anything and am made to look like the s**t player i am!  But this rollarcoaster is what make this game so exciting to play, and the feeling when you score that backwards aeriel goal is worth a hunded flapping misses as the ball slowly slides pass you into your goal...Plus if by chance you ever did start to feel tired of the format (this hasn't happened to me as yet) then the devs bring out a new game mode so i can show miss and swear, but at leats blame the ""new"" format for it!I guess the only negative is some of the players attitudes, but then its online gaming and where isn't there an a problem with a small amount of other players and their incessant need for attention, negative or otherwise!This is almost certainly a game that will never get ""put down"" or if it does its because my thumbs and fingers have given up on life and they haven't invented some sort of head bobbing eye movment mode so i can keep missing then scoring amazing goals all in one game!

												Amazing. Wow. I. Can't. Even. Wow. Rocket League is a car game and a soccer game combined. The graphics are amazing! The customization is pretty great, and has more room to expand like, adding more decals, which I would love to see, or, creating your own decals to put in the workshop or use for yourself! That would be great! The gameplay is fun, except for the fact that you can easily get ranked with people with hundreds of hours more than you and way better. Overall, it's a pretty great game and you should buy it! I totally reccomend this to any gamer that plays action games, because this game will keep you on your toes waiting for the next shot to open up...			",44,5,1,3,10,1,1

												With a total of over 600 hours played I thought it about time to write a review. While this is of course subjective based as is most reviews I hope it provides you with what you are looking for and helps you to decide if you will be purchasing this game.Common thought | Coming from mainly fps and mmo type genres I can't recall a time where I was ever interested in a sport based game in fact I dispised them. I had to be persuaded just like those I have had to persuade before they realise this is a great game that deserves a chance to prove itself. If you are like I was you have probably thrown this game out the window because you think it ""looks boring"" or ""its just soccer with cars"" and thats a shame and my goal is to help you reconsider.Match Length |Each match of Rocket League lasts 5 minutes (Custom games excluded). The match ends when the timer hits 0 and the ball hits the ground or a goal is scored. Game Modes | I will start by explaining the non-competitive (Unranked) game modes. I won't go in depth but hope to provide enough information so you get a rough idea of each one. At the time of writing this review there are 8 modes which include: Duel (1v1), Doubles (2v2), Standard (3v3), Chaos (4v4), Snow day (Ice field with a puck instead of a ball), Rocket Labs (Experimental wierd shaped maps), Hoops (Basketball court with the hoops elevated) and Rumble (A new game mode which gives players power ups every 10 seconds which can effect both the ball and other players).I personally prefer Duels and Doubles as they require more effort on my part. Standard is fine and is the most common in the pro scene however I am not a fan of that many cars on the field at one time and usually stay in goals to avoid the mayhem. 4v4 is just a cluster ♥♥♥♥ and I never play it. Snow day was fun for about 5 minutes but not something I will be going back to. Rocket Labs can be fun for some random games and provides variation from the standard maps. Hoops was also fun for about 5 minutes and I feel the court is to small and should be made larger or even the same size as the soccer field but that might come across as wierd since a basketball court is smaller then a soccer field... anyway I don't play it and won't play it again. Rumble suprised me actually. It's quite fun and its hard to predict what can happen. You opponant may shoot for goal but then the ball is frozen in mid air for a few seconds which is then saved followed by a punch which sends the ball to the other end. I will be going to Rumble when I want some variation to my game from time to time.Competitive |This is where the game gets fun however does have both pros and cons. The competitive (Ranked) game modes include Duel, Doubles, Standard and Solo Standard (3's but you queue by yourself). Ranks - A total of 10 matches are required before you will be placed into a rank. There are 4 tiers which include Prospect (Prospect 1,2,3 & Elite), Challenger (Challenger 1,2,3 & Elite), Star (Rising Star, Shooting Star, All Star & Super Star) Champion (Champion, Super Champion & Grand Champion) Each rank within a tier has 5 divisions. Once you have reached division 5 in that rank you then have a chance to move up 1 rank. PROS:1. Its hard! - Games that are easy are boring, Rocket League is a game that you progressively improve over time and there are always players at your level which means you don't always get owned. When you score a goal or win its satisfying. After 600 hours when I get a goal it still feels awesome. 2. Teamwork and Communication - Strategy is definitely something that will improve you game. Pulling off mad plays or passing at the right time then stepping our opponant to score a goal is cool as ♥♥♥♥!CONS:1. sometimes versing unfair opponants where you verse someone greatly better then yourself or a smurf which is incredibly irritating.2. The addition of the Wasteland and Tokyo maps in competitive play. I feel they shouldn't be included as the field is different then the rest of the standard maps. This means some people may get these maps more then others which I feel is unfair. Tokyo being in competitive takes it to another level. The map has elevated sides and is just rediculous. Wasteland and Tokyo should be in non competive only.Final Thought |Look the game isn't easy, it takes time to get good and a very long time to get great but don't automatically disregard the game as♥♥♥♥♥♥before you play it thats just being naive. I've read some of the negative comments on steam for Rocket League and they are a perfect example. I understand the game isn't for everyone but what I am saying is it is worth trying if you don't like it refund it. I could have continued this review and I am sure I could have written it better I haven't written many reviews. if I can update it I will later but I hope that this helps.			",54,3,2,4,4,0,2

												First of all, this is a very fun game. You can easily put hours into Rocket League. I enjoy seeing the new cars/decals/flags  they release even though you have to pay for some of them. You know, I wouldnt mind them releasing a car pack for free every now and then but this game is fairly new (2 months or so). This game can get very competitive very quickly with ranked matches or even just against bots. Cant wait to see what comes next!			",160,17,7,16,16,1,20

												This is a brilliant game, and it has the perfect micro-transaction model as the items you get from the crates are not pay to win, and are instead cosmetic. In addition, the update has established an economy for rocket league, so you can trade others crates for keys, meaning you don't even need to pay to get keys. In addition, all non-decal items in crates are worth >1 key, so there is a large possibility to make back your investment.			",93,17,2,9,5,0,7

												Psyonix is the BEST developer ever. The game is only $20 to begin with. The DLC are like $3 each and are COMPLETELY optional. The cars added through DLC are just cosmetic and give the players no advantage over others who dont have the DLC (AKA super balanced gameplay). Overall the gameplay is easy to learn YET VERY HARD TO MASTER. This game is super addictive and I can't see myself putting it down in the foreseeable future. My friends and I are moving up through the ranked leagues and although it may seem like a grind, every match is enjoyable. The car customization, cross platform play, splitscreen multiplayer, mutators, and frequent updates are some added benefits that make this game great.Must have game IMO.			",26,2,0,5,7,0,1

												This is probably one of the best and most addictive multiplayer games i've played in the last few years. The premise is simple. Its rocket powered cars playing football and its as fun and manic as it sounds. The matches take place in a big boxed in arena (yes you can drive up the walls and even on the roof) with the options of 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4 in both ranked and unranked matches (though 4v4 is not available in ranked). I'd strongly recommend a controller as well for this game.Good points:- given the premise of this game its very easy to get into but difficult to master. It requires a lot of skill to be a great player but regardless of how skillful you are, you can still have a lot of fun with this game. -This is the first cross platform multiplayer game i've played as ts possible to play against PS4 players as well as PC which is good as theres more likely to be enough players online that you wont have to wait ages to join a game.-with the matches being only around 5 minutes long its a great game to jump in and out of to kill a few mintes.-it has a great replay feature that allows you to save replays of entire matches to view again or for recording purposes.Bad points:-the servers can be a bit laggy at times and though not as bad as the it was around release it still is a problem at times.tl:dr this game has given me some of the most thrilling multiplayer experiences i've had. The feeling of grabbing a late goal to win a tight match is incredible or the devastating feeling of losing after conceding a last second goal is just something that not a lot of other games have managed to do for me. An absolute must buy.			",446,133,17,76,93,4,90

												Now you might be thinking, is Rocket League as good as everyone says it is? Is it worth the hype? I mean after all, isn't it just soccer (footbol) with cars?Rocket League is worth every single word of praise and all the hype it's gotten. It has tons of polish, great music, lots of cosmetics, a great DLC policy (cheap DLC that gives lots of customizations that don't impact gameplay) and it has A DELOREAN TIME MACHINE (DLC, but still).If you're not convinced, Rocket League is one of the most fun multiplayer games known to man. Everything that moves can explode, from the ball to your enemy cars, and now with mutators the action will never get boring.			",128,24,2,7,9,2,9

Seriously?It's Rocket League, guys. Football (or soccer if you're that kind of person) with cars. What's not to like? Oh, best played with a controller and friends. Don't have friends? Play with the bots, they're near realistic and freaking hard as hell. And don't expect this game as easy as playing other ball-kicking games, because it's not that.Enough said, get and play Rocket League.			",201,31,10,14,15,1,6

												Great for playing wth friends. Its short round based competetive multiplayer with great controls. It looks great, plays great, and the entire concept is hilariously fun.			",169,20,1,12,24,1,24

												Rocket League is fast, fun and relentlessly enjoyable. The best football game without feet.			",400,87,16,59,35,4,46
