Pre-Alpha TestFor as far as I know, the game is currently in a state of developement and includes various bugs that's not noticed. Though, it includes a fun fusioned FPS-with-vehicle gameplay which is one of the main reasons I'd recommend people to try it out. The pros and cons are simple to be listed out, if you're running on a laptop like mine having these specs...Intel Core i3 4300iU 5th Gen 4-ProcessorIntel HD Graphics 40004GB RAM256GB HDD, 256GB SSDSolid State Drive included^Then I wouldn't recommend you to run at it's highest graphical/video settings, running it at 1280x768 with ""Fast"" graphical settings would still least gain you a stable 30+ FPS gaming experience.Now to head over for the pros and cons section, let's say...Pros:*Great graphical designs*User-friendly gameplay*User-friendly tutorial*Beautiful simplistic maps*Many settings for it's graphics*Player-created bases of your own choice*Fast matchmaking system, even if it's pre-alphaCons:*Physics control's not good enough*Sound effects for engine bugs out at times*Texts for in-game chat's too small*Mouse controls bugs out when below 15 FPS*Does not include a fullscreen on/off function in settings (alt + enter works, though)Outcome of my review would be a definite 8.5/10, you've done a great job so far, developers of Impulse of War!

								Alright, alot of people seem to be saying this game is pay to play, which is in no way true. In fact, the ONLY things you have the OPTION of paying money for are premium(which doubles XP and money gain, which is common free game fare, and by no means required) and aesthetic items, currently colors and trails. Even without premium, it doesnt take all that long to get the money for things, a few matches, which if you do well, and the game lasts long enough(It's based off the points you get in a match) gives ~10~15k of the in game currency each, and that's without premium, which is plenty. Now, if you're not doing well enough, it can feel a bit like you're not making much, but... that's true regardless of if you paid for premium or not. not to mention you can log off for a while and come back to an idle game style money generator, which generates money even while offline till it hits 15k, at which point it stops until you collect it.It's an interesting concept you should try, the game's graphics are really good for a free, early access game, the controls are customizeable and handles rather smoothly. I'm honestly astounded that one person managed this much for an alpha release.Only downsides would be bugs, a wierd ""matchmaking"" system, the low player count(Though that may be an illusion caused by the matchmaking being wierd)Overall, it's a free game I recommend to anyone who wants to be part of an early access game that has a good bit of potential in my opinion.

								This is a fast paced vehicular based first person shooter. The Buggy is fast, the upcoming aircraft is fast, the tank is a tank. You have a choice of capturing flags, capturing a train or team deathmatch known as command battle. Teams cannot rescue or return their own flags. That is awesome. While this is in exremely early access at the time of this review, there is already enough functional gameplay to enjoy with others around the globe. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a FPS that is not all about gore and violence. This plays more like a sport than a war or a fight. I also recommend this to anyone who likes to drive crazy and be rewarded for it. You will be rewarded by not having to respawn. Casual or Hardcore, this is a FPS for those that like to engage the opposing team face to face.			",91,22,40,7,32,1,8

								When you look past the minor bugs that Impulse of War has in its early access stage there is a game that is nothing short of fun. It's one of those games where even if you don't have as good of aim as everyone else or aren't as good at controlling the vehicles, you still get drawn back to the game time after time because of its enjoyable playstyle and immense landscapes to drive around in. Impulse of War has so many great opportunities in its vehicles, maps, gamemodes and more that keep me excited about its future and makes Impulse of War on the right track to becoming one of my favorite games.

								I love the game beautiful graphics and simple maps that make the game very fun. I also love the rate at which you earn money it doesn’t feel like a grind. Which is a problem in many games these days. The last thing that really popped out to me in the game is the base. I really like the base and bots sometimes come to attack you. Next i would like to say that I found out recently from reading another review that there is only one developer working on this game.Congrats you have made an awesome game!!Now i would like to say what I think should be improved in the gameFirst I would like to add more vehicles. Ability to expand and build in you base more (maybe customize the Terrain to an extent to have a cool base and have more buildings to unlock more vehicles)Add clans and clan bases Friend Window (i like to chat with friends and make new ones)What I found to be a deterrent to play the game was the physics of the game on the capture the flag map when you get launched fromt the ramp the landing made you slide right into the bottom of the cliff. I found one bug on the capture the flag map I forget what happen but I couldn’t fire for the rest of the game. Driving was fine though. Also is there a English Bug Report Page (sorry wish i knew russian). In the end great job I am loving the game and continue developing the game this game has a big future ahead of it Dmitry Medvedev.Edit: the bug on the capture the flag map is with the ramps. I lose the ablitily to shot when i hit the left pillar in the air. For the rest of the game			",118,10,4,35,13,1,20

								Impulse of War, it seems like a pretty neat early access game. I know right now it runs pretty good, but I feel like it needs work in pretty much every other area.

Early Access Review
								(This is a pre-access title, so my opinion on the game may change as time goes on)THE GOOD STUFF1.  Two Vehicle Classes:  You've got the lightly armored, highly agile buggy.  And you've got the heavily armored, lumbering tank.  So simple varity.2.  The Gameplay:  So far, I've only seen Capture the Flag.  But I assume there will be more in the future.  The gameplay's pretty solid for a game that's 2 days old.3.  Wait times don't take longer than...  A half a minute.  So not too long.4.  The base generates currency even while you're offline.  You literally never have to play after the tutorial.  Just leave your base, come back, and collect the currency every day.  And you can have a tricked out ride in about a week!  Or you could play the game and get it in about...  No time flat.5.  It's Russian.  And I only put this reason so I don't go to Gulag.THE BAD STUFF1.  Early access:  Bound to be glitches.  None encountered but don't hold your breath.2. Special Ability takes too long to regen.  For the Buggy, it's a booster that literally just thrusts you up for about 8 seconds.  And then it takes 8 YEARS to regen.3.  In game payment.  Don't think this is a downside?  They said that in World of Warships, until the Tirpitz came out.  No, don't try and argue the point, it's a downside.4.  The sounds need a little work.  They aren't terrible, but they aren't great either.  The engine sounds like it's mumbling, even at full speed, and there's a lack of inertia when you go up a ramp, because the sound is so mediorcre.5.  Some of the effects seem a little unrealistic.  Like I imagined when I slammed into a rock that I'd be crush.  Nope, I ricocheted off of it and bounced about for a moment like a ball.However, despite everything I've said, I recommend supporting this game.  It's free, it's actually decent, and it's only a few days old.  Plus you get a bonus 1500 GC, (Premium Currency), for just downloading the game.  You have to go through the tutorial, of course.  But it's still worth it.  I think this game can me something really special.  Just add some more content, improve on some vehicle and landscape characteristics, and you've got a starter game bound to turn heads.			",60,10,5,5,2,0,7

								Hopefully it can get better as is goes on, but I would not recommend it currently.[b1]Pay Shop :[/b1]With so little content in the game, it is good to see that atleast there is a working pay shop to drain your money. The only saving grace it is is just for cosmetics (for now atleast.)[b1]Graphics :[/b1]The models looks like trash, just blocky figures supposed to be a vehicle, wheels are the same with noticable edges instead of a curve. The textures are seem stretched out. [b1]UI :[/b1]The UI also needs a lot of work; the text needs to be consistent instead of three different fonts, as well as not is two languages when relevant it seems lazy to just create one intro screen instead of two for US, and Russsian. kinda also applies to chat where I personally don't own a cyrillic keyboard so I can't even communicate to a Russian teamate. There is a random button just to tell you who the dev is. [b1]Gameplay :[/b1]With actual people it was actually enjoyable. The problem is is that 99% of the ""people"" are bots, with horrendous AI. Several times playing deathmatch a bot would just stroll right past, and not even bother to fire at me. Also there is several major bugs with the game, I have had several major bugs with the vehicle crashing through the ground, and my weapons locking for some reason.Flying is also useless as a feature. With the buggy once you are in the air you are just a target, and cannot even aim at the enemy let alone hit them.The base is pointless. What is it for? There is the tank factory which says it can unlock the tank for 49K currency, and all it does is then unlock it in the store you then have to pay 149K (iirc) to actually unlock the tank!There is also the leveling system, you can get a high rank, but there is no reward.

(still in early access so lots more to do)Cons: Some bugs that need to be fixed, Some grammar issues but I understand, and some upgrades are a bit pricy.And for the developer here are some bugs I have encountered while playing the game: If you spam exit (menu) sometimes the gui for the menu wont pop up. Another bug is when i joined another player and when the battle started it was a view of the battle but I could not play almost like the camera didn't load properly onto my vehicle.

								For an early-alpha game isn't bad. However, the game have a great bug, when I click on the shift to accelerate, the car it turns. It’s urgent to fix it. Physics controls aren't good enough, need a lot of work (needs a lot of more direction, lacks balance, etc.). In other hand, but less important in a game, the intro music sounds good to me. And it could have more languages, like Portuguese, and not just English and Russian. But it's good, English it’s always good. Later on, insert a tutorial is always a good idea into a game. Game still very basic but it’s normal because it’s very new (February 2017). People that gave a negative review need to understand that the game have 1 month (and one developer, just one). The game has multiplayer, so try it. I hope that in a while new features will be added and bugs will be fixed. Overall, it has potential, keep up the good work Dmitry!			",226,74,10,8,26,0,33

								Don't waste your time. Yes it free, and yes its very early in development. But there's already a cash shop in the game where you can buy currency in an alpha. There is also many other games in the driving vechicles shooter genre that are much more polished and enjoyable to play. Wait until the game is release before you try it.To be honest I don't hate it. It's decent work for just one person developing the game. It runs on Unity, and performes well enough. I just feel at it's current state it is not worth your time, unless you want to be a guinea pig.			",224,49,13,28,18,3,27

								This game seemed like it would be a cool fusion of robocraft and rocket league so I installed. It's free - why not. First launch and the tutorial crashes immediately, second launch we're good to go. Now we get to drive around a poorly designed map to shoot some crates and learn how to use WASD and the LMB. But let's go to our base. Turns out you can build. The facilities themsleves take about 10 second to actually be created, and being the stunning clever young man that I am, I drove right into the building spot before it finished and got stuck in the damn thing. How is that overlooked? Thoroughly underwhelmed, and for that reason... I uninstalled.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								this game is a lot of fun.  like a more complex version of Tank Ball.  needs more features and more people tho.  bots and game modes get old with experience.  the physics are a blast.  no fall damage so there's no excuse to not go full Stunticon.  i found remapping the key controls for the three different thrusters to be a game changer..  crucial for out-maneuvering opponents and directing aim while in the air. binding back thruster to shift can give a handbrake effect for pulling off donuts and quick turn arounds.  UI is funny at first.  a few minor bugs.  nothing to lose by downloading			",107,10,2,9,4,1,2

								I've been playing this game for a week or so since the pre-alpha keys were released to testers. The game is still miles and miles away from completion but the current state of the game is defiently playable by all means.The game currently, at the time of writing, consists of two different vehicles you can commandeer. The first is a buggy, which you start of with. This little dude is unarmoured, nimble and can do alot of damage by getting behind enemy lines and stealing the flag- returning it to the allied base and scoring lots of points for your team. The second vehicle is a tank, which I personally haven't got around to using yet, as the base structure to produce it is 49000 coins.Currently <Impulse of War> is still in alpha but it is plenty playable.Thomas_,Pre-Alpha Tester.

								This game seemed like a pretty good idea. First off I couldn't get a good experience because of a few problems which seemed to be actually big problems. I wasn't able to put my headphones on because at 31% sound it sounded as if somebody in my living room could hear it through my headphones. It was extremely loud but I usually have that problem with a few steam games but easily could have just turned it down. Another problem was frames, I was so laggy. I tried turning my settings down 2 times but only thing that happened was the game stopped responding and it was a weird type of fullscreen to where I couldn't even start up task manager with Ctrl + Alt+ Del. I had to keep clicking to where it would allow me to click End Proccess to where my Windows would restart. I had to then restart up the game and wait 5 minutes in order for all the new settings to load in which were the lowest that seemed possible. They have a custom little Game Quality which you'd think they would use just low, medium, High but they didn't. I put it all the way at the bottom Simple and it was really laggy. I'd imagine if frames wise I'd be getting like 13 constantly. So i started moving around in this little car I started off with, it was weird and I even got stuck on a tree. I tried moving to the right but it seems like those car controls are the ones without right and left unless you are going fowards or backwards first. I also didn't see anything that told me about objectives except for the side of the screen it said ""go to the base"". I looked around and seen a big spaceship and a blue circle surrounding something. I tried to go towards the blue orb thing but my game suddenly just stopped responding and made my windows crash. I can run a lot of other games fine but you'd think that a Unity game like this which doesn't really look anything like these newer games would run smoother but nope.			",61,4,0,10,6,2,1

Impulse of War is a really good game I played since the closed alpha.It has action filled battles and it is very unique.Pros:+you can modify your car (or tank)+very good performance (for an alpha game)+multiple maps/game modes+the cars have some sort of thrusters, so you can fly with them+the developer is very nice+many players+nice graphics+funny bugs+build your own base+not pay2winCons:-some bad bugs-ai is not perfect-some lobbys are laggyI would totally recommend testing out this game, it has many features and sometimes the bugs make the game even more funny.9/10 Stars★★★★★★★★★☆ ",32,6,4,2,11,2,1

								Very smooth game mechanics and beautiful game running at high frames and the game is still visually imersive I would recomend this game in its current state however I have notice a couples here and there buts its alpha so it has some bugs but nothing gamebreaking! (sometimes the enemy would spawn in the same location as you but I got the melee weapon) The matchmaking is fairly balanced and the upgrading mechanics are just as good as any other! I haven't notice many drawbacks to the game the matches are nice and short, face paced action packed fun making playing fun and the customization is just colors for now but they do give a cosmetic appeal and it also helps support the developers of the game !
