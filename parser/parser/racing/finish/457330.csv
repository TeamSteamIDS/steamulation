								Hard to play? Yes. Premium Shop? Yes. Fun and Good comunity? Yes.But for what i've played i liked and disliked at the same time.. The game have a lot of bugs but some of them are fixed now.. but still have a lot to be fixed, it's playable.It's hard to play as i said, but with some training gets a lot easier. Just give it a try, and the game it's still in early acess soo i thing you have nothing to lose at this point.Give it a chance and don't get turned off by the negative reviews, most of the people who gave a negative review didn't even played 1 hour... It's a free game anyway, nothing to lose, nothing to win. 7/10 (sorry for bad english) :P			",100,23,8,18,9,0,8

								For a game about drifting, the physics are so off it's pathetic. Wheel and Controller support is extremely basic (you can't use it in menus, making playing it infront of a TV in Big Picture annoying). Graphics are a joke, matchmaking is non existent and all the cars sound like lawnmowers.Well, I say 'all the cars' but in reality all you can drive for free is a 'tezza Altezza'. You start off with some feeble in-game currency that gets you pretty much nothing. You need to buy the events to take part, you need to buy the tools to tune your car, you need to buy the packages to install the parts and you have to buy any new cars if you want them. They didn't even bother to get some real car licencing to justify having to spend REAL money!One of the worst F2P cash grabs i've ever seen.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I thought the negative reviews were basing the game off of very popular publishers like Turn10's Forza series...I was wrong, this game is almost unplayable... Pro's : It's a drifting game.Decent amount of car selectionNice realistic upgrading capabilities, like Valves, Pistons, Camshafts, Crankshafts, Turbos, etc.Free to installThey tried to incorporate real factors like engine wear, tire wear, oil life, etc.Con's : This game is not modeled around any realistic drifting principals...The engine sounds are very annoying.There is no player base.You can't earn enough cash to get a better vehicle without spending real money.Everything basically costs real money.The cars don't even feel arcady, they feel like you took a 64bit game and translated it into a modern dress...Again, the driving characteristics stink...This game is a grind, you get almost nothing per race: 3-4000 credits... This sounds nice until you realize just a set of pistons will cost you around 50,000...When you finally get enough to upgrade your internals you find out you have to be a higher level...All of you money ends up going back to repairing your car 24/7... You tires last about 5-6 races, and cost about 10 grand, so there goes half your money... Then you need an oilchange, another 5 grand, and to service your engine, another 5 grand... You get the point...The game has been set up as a pay to play, for instance it costs you 120 greens to get a new license plate... Which greens can only be bought with your real life cash....This could all be over looked if it was a great game, but I added a tuning kit which added 100hp 100 torque to my engine... And I still get the same characteristics... The drifting feels very unrealistic... You can't use body roll...In real life, I use body roll to get my subaru to lean into a drift and I use my cars weight to continue the drift... In this game, if you use body roll your stuck taking the corner normally but with your tires smoking... Then when you use and E-brake your car drifts for 1 second and loses all of its speed...I thought upgrading my car would fix these issues and make the game playable... I thought that with my torque and hp I could engage a drift by knocking my rear end loose through sheer power... However, the car acts just like before except I can now hold a drift for 2 seconds...I would say, save your time and hardware space and skip on this game... I was honestly hoping for a very nice game to play with but I got a crappy game....			",50,2,7,3,5,0,4

								I understand that this is an early access title and that with any title in this status there are things that are not going to either be incomplete or necessarily function correctly.  However this game needs so much more development than I think it should even go into early access. After playing this game for a bit over an hour here are my thoughts:* You are restricted to only using the keyboard and you can't even customize it so that if you don't like using the arrow keys you're out of luck* The car models and track models in this game are beyond bland. * The car models (appearance only) are straight rips of real life vehicles. The e190 is a straight rip of a 190 Evo, the Mustang is a straight rip of a Ford Mustang, the Camaro a Chevrolet Camaro, so on and so forth. There is no way the developer paid to license these names or the vehicles themselves. I'll be very surprised if they don't get sued by the various auto makers that hold trademarks on these vehicle likenesses and names. * The only way I could slightly differentiate between each track was what was in the background. The tracks (limited as they were) were not distinguishable or special in any way* There is only one playable race mode and who finishes first has zero affect on the winner. It  simply looks at who had the highest scoring drifts. That makes sense since it is a drifting game but it would be much more of a challenge if placement affected the total score* You can only race one friend at a time. This is beyond silly in the day and age where it's not unusual to have a lobby full of 16 people playing a game, even a racing game* It is far too easy to drift in this game, it takes absolutely zero skill. The slightest tap sends you careening around a corner. I was hoping that this game would actually take some effort and timing to get the best drifts possible but that is not the caseI could go on and on about this game but it is going to need a lot more development before it is even remotely close to something that I would even vaguely consider playing again.

								---WARNING, MICROTRANSACTIONS UP THE WAZOO---Edit: The game doesn't ""require"" you to pay for their services, but man it would help. Instead they yield you with about 2k credits averaging every race and expect you to race enough to buy parts and/or kits worth 50k averaging. If you want a new car? My best advice is to get warehouse tickets with their PTP money that they give you in the beginning and snag those end race cards and get warehouse tickets to sell for around 10k a piece. And yes, that's even with ticket rarity that they are all 10k a piece. What a load of crap, right?At first, the game seemed to be really ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Like REALLY ♥♥♥♥♥♥. But as I started playing more and selling the useless warehouse tickets, I finally got my POS Altezza to a less-but-still-♥♥♥♥♥♥ POS Altezza.Winning matches doesn't yield enough credits or ""rupees"" for whatever reason. Even when I have a 10 mil advance on the guy in points.Tried lap running too, yields me the same amount of XP and credits, so that's broken.Game overall feels good drifting once you get the hang of it. They charge you to do the typical modding that a car requires to actually make a decent drifter. My issue is that there's not that balance of ""sure, I can pay, or I can have fun and race a couple times to not pay"", and you instead get ""Sure, I could pay, or I can race 1 million times over and over (and that's if you're winning) to get a new car"". (unless you sell warehouse tickets for 10 a piece even on rarity)Oh, and those tickets are useless unless you pay anyways, because that makes sense I guess. (not really)I reccommend it because it's fun to♥♥♥♥♥♥around with friends, but if you're trying to do anything more than what they just give you in the beginning, you're going to be in for quite the grind. Which I'm surprised for an EA game.I don't reccommend due to bugs, gameplay is stale, grind is grindy (redundant, but moreso than that of let's say WoW), and not much customization unless you pay.

								I just want to start by saying that you should not listen to the reviews saying negative things about this game. All of them have the same thing in common. 0.1 hours played. High Octane Drift is very fun and easy to get a handle on. It definetly is not like any real drifting, but that is almost the beauty of it. It's a new mechanic to learn and it's fun to practice it and get better. The customization of cars is awesome. There are not as many cars as I would like, but it's still in development. Modifications are very good. There are many different options with pros and cons on each part. I would like to see more body kits and exterior modifications, but again, I still have hope for the future. When first starting there is a tuorial of some sort... For me it was buggy and not helpful at all. I did resort to asking other people online (Mostly everyone online is pretty cool too) about things and using Google. After playing and messing with things on my own, it came along pretty quickly. Microtransactions are 100% not needed and not intrusive at all. You do get an edge by paying real money, but name a game that you dont get an edge by paying. There is also a mechanic where you must repair your vehicle, buy tires, buy fuel, etc. At first I was very turned off by this, but it is not bad at all. Overall High Octane Drift needs some work to be better, but being in open development means they will gradually improve! I'd definetly say play this game and spend at least 30 minutes in it			",13,1,2,1,2,1,0

								I am not sure what  to say w/o actually offending people. This game isnt really what you would expect from the screenshots.The driving isnt that good. It feels like your driving a 50 ton boat on icy surface. There isnt an actual feel for the speed. The engine/soundeffects are really bad. The ""shop"" is an actual shop where you can buy Points with real life money and spend it on tuning parts for your car, also most of the ""tuning"" parts are blocked, so that means you actually need to play the game for a long time to unlock them TO THEN buy them using real life money or ingame currency, which is ridiculously expensive.1 / 5Would not recommendTry a ""racing"" flash game instead			",87,6,3,14,6,0,4

								I really, really want to give this a thumbs up, but I can't. The physics, although arcade like, shows promise, but the real downfall is the pay to play that is implemented in the game. Yes, you get a free car, but unless you play reall money, you can't get another. Also, parts of the game are all written in Russian, but is being marketed to a American and Europen audiance, doesn't make much sense to me. Maybe over the next few weeks, the will fix these things, but I doubt it, since world of tanks and the obsurd pay to play it has, all of these developers seem to be going that direction. Hell, drop the play to play crap, and I'd pay to help development, but pay to play shows me your just after a money grab.			",27,4,13,2,14,0,3

								This game is pure torture.  Title High Octane Drift   Developer Cruderocks   Publisher Cruderocks  Release 11 October 2016  Graphics 3D   Genre Racing/drifting  Price Free-to-play  Rating  2/10 The game.High Octane Drift is a racing game where players pave the way to bigger and better cars by earning cash. You can build and customize cars, from their engines to their gear ratios and leave opponents in the dust.But forget, this game in just a few minutes becomes a complete torture. And the torture begins soon in the tutorial. Why? The gameplay is the worst there is.Gameplay.You need to race on various tracks that test different skills, get sponsor contracts, and join a team for team-based racing. Compete in racing events with up to 32 other players and conquer daily challenges for rewards and fame.Securing points in the races (by doing drifts of course) will give you credits which you can then use to improve your car, or make any repairs that you need to do. Thereafter, you may choose from a huge range of upgrade parts for you to purchase and put in your machine. Upgrades includes those ones that affect performance and those that are purely for aesthetics in the game. Each upgrade costs some form of resource in the game and the better the upgrade, the more it costs.The physics are so bad, so awful. Drifting is so inconsistant. Even more for a drift game, which should have a gameplay appropriate to the genre of the game.Graphics are the truly bad too. The matchmaking seemed is non-existent and all the cars sound like lawnmowers.Add to this, the game have a lot of bugs. This has to be one of the buggiest early access titles I've ever seen.Pay-to-play.The game doesn't ""require"" you to pay for their services, but ofc it would help. In reality all you can drive for free is a 'tezza Altezza'. Basically, you will have to spend real money if you want to evolve in the game and the craziest thing is that they didn't even bother to get some real car licensing to justify having to spend real money. This leads to believe that it is just another game for developers to earn easy money, without betting on the development of it.Pros. (+)Good question, no pros in this game for me.Cons. (-)Horrible physics.No matchmaking.Bugs.Graphics.The game don't have much customization unless you pay - pay-to-play.Just don't. An unbelievable game, for the worst reasons.			",226,74,10,8,26,0,33

Early Access Review
								As I type this review I've played this game for an hour, I may or may not continue playing.This review is meant more as a first impression review taking in as much as I can and giving as much information as I can think of that's relevant to a review.The garage/menu.With the garage menu it's very easy to soft lock the game by having the tabs at the top to become completely invisible which had happened to my twice when clicking the social tab, or create overlapping texts / menu's (when you click another tab the texts / menu's will remain visible).This didn't actually bother me all too much, I see it as something that could be easily fixed and probably will be fixed in the future.The controls.I like that the controls are fully bindable, however I think it's stupid that one of the buttons to bind is a button to switch from Automatic to Manual, this should just be an option that is permanent because it's unlikely that someone would want to switch between the two on the fly.The car handling.Obviously I only have the default car available with the platform kit that you are suggested to purchase during the tutorial, I feel like the car handling is actually decent, I tend to do a lot of 180's from severe oversteer which I believe is my controllers fault, Xbox One where as I'm used to using an Xbox 360 controller.The pay wall. (The reason I'm giving this game a negative review)If you haven't played the game and manage to read this review then I'll explain the resource system the game has.You have Gas and Tires (as well as Oil later on it seems like) that are resources that are required to participate in races.These resources can be purchased with in game currency or with real money.This might not sound bad and might not even seem bad at first until you think of it in the bigger picture, and the way I see it is that if I'm losing resources while gaining currency and ultimately having to dump this currency back into these resources, how will I ever be able to afford upgrades by using in game currency? Well to answer that, either you dedicate A LOT of time to this game or you simply don't, in other words you use real money. If the game didn't have such a stupid system I would actually consider using real money in the game because I would at least be able to continue playing the game and enjoy playing without having to worry about something stupid like that.Also the repair system is kind of stupid but that's more bareable because you can do the free repair when you aren't playing the game at least.All in all I rate the game a 7/10 as a fun drifting game but a 4/10 for the game as a whole.I'd highly recommend checking out alternatives instead of using any real money in this game.

								I would just firstly like to say that if you are looking at the reviews. DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM! yes the game can crash and is slow at some points but it is early access (At the moment) when the game does fully come out, i can see this game being one of the best drifting games out there(yes seriously) And i would just like to say a massive thanks to the developers for making such an amazing game, and i cant get enough of it. One of the things that need fixing is when you start a rivals event like tandem, and says 5,4,3,2,1 go. after go it takes another 5 seconds or so until you can actually start driving, any way apart from that it is an amazing game even at its stage. and would highly reccommend trying this out if you love, drifting, cars and customization.

								Physics are very bad, just awful. The starter car... I understand that in race games you are suppose to start out with a very low end car and build yourself up from there, but my god the physics on the starter car (and really every other car) are SO awful that it's not even worth putting in more time to improve it. It's not fun practically being locked in 2nd gear maxed out at about 35mph. Also the sound gets annoying super fast, it's all the same wimpy, disgusting vacuum sounding cars. The game can, and definitely is pay to win but that comes natural with any F2P. However, trying to get things legitimately in-game are so ridiculously expensive you almost have no choice, unless you want to spend countless hours grinding to even get something that might slightly help you improve. I would not recommend this to friends or other people, you could have a lot more fun drifting in pretty much any other racing game. Very disappointing that even to this day there is yet to be a good drifting game on steam..			",93,7,10,3,7,0,1

								So i got now more time ingame than the most reviewer here.proMultiplay Drifting race game some single player modes (didnt tested them)had alot of fun during the 2hours of gameplay saw guy with over 1million points in first round of 2 i dont know if you guys know the game project torque the controls feels samei liked the game and this one here too consMenu need fixes the items need discriptions the tutorial dont explain the menu well but at the end i have to say its early access and i hope this game will get his polished and finish menu soon as it leaves early access or in the next few updates but for now the 2hours i played had alot of fun drifting around  ",217,22,10,27,23,5,36

								Its early and buggy i get that... Pros:-Lots of stuff to change on your car-Solid amount of Vehicles (it seems) -Graphics look somewhat appealing (at times) -Nice loginscreenCons: -Horrible sound ( like ear cancer level) -> Your car makes the same noise for a long time if you lock in 2nd gear for drifting..-Drifting mechanic feels like a balance parkour on a cardboardbox strapped ontop of a football and sprinkled with oil. -Menu design is not really usefull. There are collums but under play you see 4 big boxes with no texts explainig whats going on -> could use some more filling -Gamepad implementation is kinda weird though Xbox / PS3 pads seem to work fine. -Options not complete -> Sound menu? Dead zones for pads? Quick menu is a joke during races...-Micro transactions...... in an Early Access game-Fuel, Tire system (similar to endurance in other games) -> really guys? REALLY? For a game that is in Early Access for 10 Months now its very weak. It feels like a clear money rip off  for Microtransactions from the devs. (though thats my personal opinion.)Don´t gonna play this game for a while now maybe never ever.... ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game seems to be getting a lot of hate on here but for what it is (a FREE early access game) its quite solid. Yes there are lots of bugs and the servers do have issues sometimes, but that happens even in AAA titles nowadays throughout their first week or two, which at the time of this review this game is hardly a week old. When playing this game you must remember that you are playing a free trial of the what is essentialy the BETA.  This game has a lot of potential and I hope people will support the devs. in getting it to where it needs to be. It has tons of customization options, fun tracks, and fun acrade style physics.

								so far the game is pretty good. if you have issues with your car not being able to be controlled like you want to, use a game pad or steering wheel and change your tire compound, track compound obv for high hp cars. esperiment with your tires and fuel type also. currency is rather cheap, i like that, but i dont like upgrading the garage to find out i have to spend and extra 60g each vehicle to adjust the suspension adn other parts per car, i think i spent enough on the garage upgrades, what do you think? yes plenty of bugs and upgrades are kind of ""unoriginal"" or  ""baseline"" but i mean c'mon they just released this game, i think it really could be the next big mmo racing game if approached right, keep it up guys, fix the bugs, bring more cars and ESPECIALLY more maps please please please. keep up the good work!

								This game is LOADS of fun.For everyone that has put a negative review, you'll realize they don't have more than 30 minutes played on the game. This is because the starting car is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's the hardest thing to try and get the stock altezza to drift. Anyone who gives it a positive review has played for longer than this. Pick up the game now. It's an amazing game, with a great community, great cars, an amazing customization aspect, and more!You can make your own vinyl wraps, custom rims, custom engines, custom everything! Your car is your car, and that's what makes this game amazing. Not only that, but it has a competitive aspect, as well as a chill freeroam aspect to it. It's everything all in one, and the only reason someone might dislike it is because the starting car is aids and they don't care enough to save up the $$ to upgrade.My personal recommendation is saving up for the 180 then buying that. It's a lot easier to drift in and you can learn from ther.			",68,9,5,5,2,0,0

								If cars actually drove like in game, we'd all be dodging cars on the street. They slide way way too much, and you never get anywhere over 3rd gear. On top of that, the sound is terrible. The horn is a recording of someone letting someone know they're here.Sometime during the ""tutorial"" they say to click the up arrow as fast as you can to keep your tires sliding. Well, if you get off the throttle for .000000000000000001 seconds, you pretty much apply the brake so hard, you come to near stop.If you guys want to see good drifting, I recommend watching your friend scoot on the floor over this.

								Let me start by saying, give this game a try.  It's fun at it's best and it needs more player base.That said, it needs a lot of work, especailly making the game enjoyable by fixing the economy.  As iit stands, getting started sucks, and you really can't make enough  money to do more than maintain the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ starter car.Definitely has a lot of potential.  Mechanics are very good, controls are excellent and very very configurable for controller, even able to put cluch on left trigger (gas/brake on RT/RB in my case).  Highly recommend trying it out, hopefully they will unlock more mods and cars to buy with ingame funds, doing so might bring more players.			",85,1,9,7,19,1,4

								Right now the game is unplayable for me unless I spend money, but from what I played it is very VERY fun and a cool concept. Take all of the almost ""payed to play"" out and make it a game you dont need to spend over $10 on just to get that one good car and fix the the fule glitch and I will thumbs up the game and even spend a little bit of moneys on the game. As it stands right now it is a thumbs down but keep heading in the direction it seems you guys are going in and it will be a solid   game ;).			",47,2,8,1,1,0,0

								Do not download this game. It is not worth it (Even though it's free)The drifting in this game is like having a poo standing up, you can do it if you put your mind to it and you train a LOT. But what's the point if you can just sit down and do it in a less frustrating, messy and annoying way. Basically what I am trying to say is just get a job and buy a good game like forza for the money you make in the same amount of time you would have to put into this game to actually learn how to drift.

								This game looked promicing, early access drifting game for free. After playing, I wouldn't buy this game if it was 50p.The graphics arent the greatest but thats not a problem, its the physics that are. The games description calls them 'realistic'.The cars handel like their on glue most of the time yet sometime they are as slippy as ice, with no idication as to why, and the game is so full of glitches and bugs that it coulld be called an insectarium (yes I bothered to wiki that) and the early access title doesnt cover that. Its well over a year old,  and from old videos on YT, practically all of the glitches i've seen are still in the game over a year later. It has been poorly and incompletely translated to English and the term 'matchmaking' doesn't exist in the games dictionary as an E-class car can go up agianst an A or B-class making a victory impossible and minimum xp and credits. So, TLDL: Bad graphics and physics, full of bugs and glitches, bad translation and no MM at all. Dont waste your time.			",52,3,15,1,7,1,4

								If you want a true review here it is. This game is great it takes some time to get used to how the drifting works but it is tricky, I suggest you read the tips when you play the tutorial they do help for learning how the drifting works in this game. There are a lot of things that need to be fixed in this game but you have to remember this is early access...This games is just fun to go and mess around in, you can learn how the drifting really works and get pretty good at it, it just takes some time. So dont go and listen to all the bad reviews that says it sucks, it does but in a good way that has potential. Also I suggest using a controller, if you want keyboard is fine but it gets tricky at times. Also remember this game is FREE to play.....Did I also forget to metion that this games is originally a russian drifting game so the spelling and games might seem werid to most of us....

								Game is quite nice, it's ""driftable"" and you don't need to have a super computer to run it.Too bad there isn't European server, i have to play on NA. Even if i tried an online race with some random guy (doing some tandoms) and wasn't quite bad, it felt like i was in European server actually.On the down side, it crashes sometimes. But since the game is new, devs are probably doing their best to fix the game and add more content on it.Edit: Forgot to mention, it feels like a smartphone game, but isn't a bad thing, since it it's free2play8/10 And waiting for new update for fix the crashes.

								I want to start off by saying I do not recommend this game in it's current state. It has a lot of potential but is lacking a LOT in the current state of the game. It's a really good drifting simulator with actual progression, it's a lot easier when you re-bind the keys from Up, Down, Left and Right arrow to W, A, S and D, but the amount of glitches with the game is insane. I'll go through them in one moment. I want to start by listing my system specs. I'm running the game on maximum graphics, as high as I can possibly get them without an external program.I'm running...Processor: AMD FX 8320 8 Core, 3.5 ghz clock speedGraphics card: Nvidia Geforce GTX 960 SSC ACX 2.0RAM: 16gb DDR3-No SSDI know I only have 0.6 hour's but in that 0.6 hour's I have experienced an entire plethora of glitches.Let's get into this shall we?- First off I launched the game and accidentally clicked the register button before typing in a name, therefore creating an infinite loading error. (I assume the developer has not coded in a proper ""I'm sorry, we need you to fill in the required field"" notification.) To fix this i pressed Alt + F4, relaunched the game, typed in a proper name and clicked register and continued on my merry way.- It seem's that English is not the primary language of the developer, it's all very broken and hard to understand. I assume he/she is russian because of the amount of russian text in the game on the english version. So either take some classes or get a proper way to translate, or even have someone else do it for you if that is at all possible.- Even with my hardware compared to the recommended hardware on the highest possible graphics I experienced a hell of a lot of frame stutter while trying to drift, not so much to the point that it's perfomance impacting, but to the point where my surrounding's we're all stuttering pretty badly.- There was this thing when I happened to recieve some kind of gift or something, it told me it gave me 2,000 rupee's (The in-game currency, very Zelda like.) but I don't think I got the rupee's. I'm pretty sure it glitched out and did not give me anything.- I would recommend by default having the drive key's set to W, A, S and D instead of the arrow key's.- The graphic's are surprisingly worse than I expected them to be, the screenshot's look really nice even when you boot up the game the background look's really impressive, i'm not saying that's a bad thing, i'm just saying it's kind of weird considering what the recommended part's are to play this game.- Also I was not able to access key features like fullscreen toggle, option's and setting's until I had first completed the tutorial, which was gruesome to get through with the arrow keys.Final Words.If you're considering getting this game, please do. try it out, if you don't like it, just wait a while until it's a clean and pristine version, much better than the one now. I for one really like this game and want to see where it goes as the last drifting simulator type of game I've played was I think The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift or something or another for the Playstation 2.- Message to the developer'sPlease do not get mad at this review, some developer's out there (I'm not naming any) can't take constructive criticism.I really like this game but it needs a lot of work.- SincerelyNinja			",77,6,3,11,7,0,0

								The only reason as to why people have negative review for this game is the starter car, which is incredibly hard to drift with when starting off. This game has the style of a freemium game, much like free games on mobile phones such as Clash Royale which has the option of buying in game currency to progress far more faster than a person grinding for in game currency. Even though the game is clearly unfinished, it's still a really good game. Altough, I wish there was a bigger community because most of the servers are empty, at least in the American servers.

								This game has some very serious potential, it looks fine and the physics seem alright as well. My only complaint is that it has a pay wall, you have to ""earn"" the premium currency in order to unlock some of the core features of the game (car tuning, I mean wtf...) and you just can't have that. I'm always happy to help out devs by the means of cash money, but when they force it I just get turned off from the whole game. I'll check back in the coming months to see if this changes but at this point I personally would say to stay away from this title unless your willing to spend a good bit of cash to jump start the beginning, as the first car you get is slow as all hell and you'll likely just get discouraged trying to race the people that have been grinding or have paid.

								Well to be honest i don't expect much - i thought it's going to be another mediocre random drifting game made with unity engine - It's surprisingly enjoyable at some part.the gameplay was alright. It doesn't feel too realistic which is good for some people (like me, for example), who just want to enjoy it without messing it up too much. The customization was pretty good since it allows you to make your own paintjob, and it has alot of bodykits and wheels options. It also allows you to take a part in online session where you can trash your tyre together with some random internet friends.But the downside... The sound design was pretty much lacklustre at this point, lack of background music and the annoying engine note ruins it, also the grinding was kinda annoying at some times (but yeah, it's F2P) and some few bugs here and there... but it's an early access game so what do you want to expect.i'd recommend it but don't expect it as a ""Fully Blown Realistic Drifting Simulator"" - but hey, atleast you don't need to pay a cent to play it.

								Very good game and has lots of content and replay value for a free game. Although the cars are rip-offs, they hold a close image to their real cars. You drift for money, points and xp and the cars that are put on price have large gaps in price meaning you need to grind for the car you really want. Although the game has microtransactions, it helps the developers and purchases don't make a great deal in difference except from the customization (a wide range of everything) since you need skill to hold the point streak. Overall, a great game for no price at all and is great for car enthusiasts.			",3,1,3,0,2,0,0

								Went into the game not expecting much and got just that. Now dont get me wrong the game has base to become something good, but as it stands now the controls are terrible and floaty, the sound is ear grating and the graphics....i dont know how to explain it but they just bother me. In short give this game a year and try it then and see if its anygood.			",90,3,6,12,3,0,13

								Do not bother installing, it is literally a waste of time.First off:-graphics look like their from ps2 era (this game looks like it could run on one of those super old gpu's, the listed requirements make no sense)-No feedback while driving, its supposed to be a full on drifting game, but the game gives you no feedback whatsoever about anything that could help you improve your drift.-Customization is ridiculously expensive and so are the cars.-And the worst part, IT HAS TIMERS, seriously, you have to fix your car, like the engine, transmission and etc... And you have to wait for it to be finished, its like one of those stupid mobile games and you have to pay if you want it to finish instantly. F*** THAT! this needs to end, this type of garbage mechanics should not be on pc.There are so much better games out there and this, save your money and get something like forza or need for speed, those two have everything this does but a lot better and with a lot more.PLEASE DO NOT LET GARBAGE LIKE THIS SURVIVE, END THIS STUPID TYPE OF GAMES WITH TIMERS, SERIOUSLY!

								Game looks nice and all but,1 The physics suck.2 It's not really a free to play, you have to pay real money to get/unlock stuff.3 I absoluteley wouldn't recomend it to anyone who loves to drift and doesn't have a small loan of a million dollars.I hate this game just because you get teased to personalize your car, but what you'll get is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ starter car that can't even drift when stock, you can only upgrade it one time to stage 1 (then ur broke) that actually does no ♥♥♥♥. You can't afford other cars. And all upgrades are expensive as hell. Just don't bother downloading it if you have a small wallet and a passion for drifting. It will crush your drift dreams.conclussion: This game sucks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I know It's early access, but this looks and sounds like a school project for early stage programmers.How this made it onto Steam in the first place is beyond me.I have a hard time seeing potiential in this game as all the core elements are so far from just decent that I don't think it will be possible to make this good in any way, at least not with the currnt engine and/or Dev studio.If you launch a game that you want people to like, you should have at least 1 or 2 core elements almost perfectet.Most people could live with poor graphics and bad audio in early access if the car handling was awesome or they would be okay with poor graphics, mediocre handling and physics if the audio was awesome, had a great soundtrack and the game surpported gamepad/controller.This game has NO redeeming elements, and it seems like the Devs used more energy on car graphics than they did on actual gameplay like handling, plus... a drift game that only supports digital input (keyboard) at launch has a bullet in its foot from the start.If I'm wrong and this game has potential, it has been released at least a year too early.

								Initally, this game can seem overwhelming with the number of menus and different options avaiable to you. Some arent working due to this game being a work in progress. However, if you stick with it you will soon discover that making money to upgrade your car isnt as difficult as it seems. Control wise, this game has basic controls, using the arrows to control the car. I havent driven a car with lots of upgrades so i cant say what it feels like. However with practice you can get some pretty decent scores. Graphic wise, it will adjust itself so you never have to worry about lag due to the specs of your computer. Overall this game has a alot of potential and I would recommend it to most people who love cars.			",4,18,1,1,8,0,2

								This game is one if not the best f2p racing games on steam.pros- . lots of customization anywhere from the flywheel to spoilers everything in a engine you can change.. a good amount of cars. 15-25 cars, they all can get lowerd and customized.. a good repair system and sponsor/contracts are good. . the cars look really good. Solid game for early access. you get around 4k gold for losing 10k win. 7k lose 12-15k win with premium.. Buying things with real cash is cheap. Not a pay to win. ITS NOT DEADcons-. Getting greens is hard but you start out with some. (dont waste them). the maps are so bad (that doesnt really matter to much). takes a while to get good.. there is no ranking system so you could play with insanely good people.. some stuff is out of reach. i have 15 hours and still havnt played lap gamemode(that mode is dead). need more tuts for someone who has no idea about cars.the only reason this has mixed reviews is becasue people dont wanna put time into the game.15 hours i have a skyline upgraded and a 180 upgraded. There is alot in this game. i dont play very many f2p games.but this was really fun. and will play more. ",66,6,7,6,12,1,7

								So I crashed my car and now I have to wait while it's repaired or spend currency in-game that costs real money.  Hmm, I think while I'm waiting for my car to be fixed it ought to give me just enough time to uninstall.  Plus the controls are a little wonky, haven't used the arrow keys since my Doom 2 days, I can't retrain my brain that fast!			",121,21,5,14,15,1,11

You start up with this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ car and you have to begin youre grindingness to get better parts but this isnt the bad thing the bad thing is matchmaking. Then i started i went on a race jsut to be greated to race pros when whay get 2 mil in one go and meanwhile i coud bearly get 100k so mm is horable. Gearbox OH MY GOD now if you are not a car guy it will not bother you but who ever is a car guy you will want to take a knife and stab developers because i started getting annoyed how you will hear gears grinding and scraping something i dont know what but it will drive you mad. Ok now good things It has nice costumasation and grapchis i loved it but economy is just stupid. Some parts like wheals are not even aveable for you because you have to buy them with in game currancy which you get it from real money or 1 token per level (btw like wheals thay can cost up to 36 tokens) Bumpers cost more then engine which is SO STUPID! I recommend getting Drift Street Japan you you are looking for entertainment or nice community! Now this is a free game and its♥♥♥♥♥♥but it cost nothing of corse its pay to win but is also free unlike drift street japan and also this game only takes 2g of space so if you want to try go ahead but just dont waste youre money on it please!

								Ah yes. High Octane Drift. The game that tries to be Forza but fails along the way. Here's why:- The tracks feel super plain.- What even is physics, this makes Goat Simulator feel more accurate in terms of physics.   The cars handle like boats, honestly.- I'd suggest investing in a Unity Plus upgrade, monthly costs are relatively low.- The viewing angle of the cars while drifting is painfully low.- gameObject.FindWithTag(""MainCamera"").GetComponent(Camera).nearClipPlane = 0.01;   Thank me later.What I actually liked about the game:- The customization is farely nice. - Holy crap you can rebind your controls.- Graphics are OK, a little plain though.A tip from developer to developer: Don't focus on the drifting part of the game, if you add regular racing physics where you can push the car to the point of losing traction, you're doing it right. Then the drift community will come to you, because it'll feel way more authentic than the car automatically going sideways if you ever so slightly nudge your steering buttons.Also, take my advice with a grain of salt, for it may not always work. But Forza did it, LFS did it, and pretty much every other game did it.(I'll gladly help you if needed.)			",67,8,7,4,6,0,3

Terrible, the game is terrible.This game felt like an unfinished mobile game that was made on MS Paint, Judging By the title screen it seems half decent. But then I actually spawned in and wow, it looked bad.. So I crank up the settings to max and all it did was add vignette :/Thats was the first 2 minutes of my experience, So I thought ""oh maybe its just graphics"" BUT NOPE. It was terrible! I accelerate and it takes about a whole second to respond (Not my keyboard, Brand new k65) and the handling is just terrible with keyboard, so I plug in my wheel and stuff and I try it once more.NUP.Still terrible handling, just slightly turning to the left would make the whole car spin out, and not only that, the handbrake is more like a line of code that just says ""slow-down:car:50% and -Lose-All-Traction""This game sucks BALLS.P.s. you may be thinking ""oh this dude has only 9 minutes his review isnt serious"" I played it on my other account :) ",10,0,2,3,1,0,2

								I've been playing Gran Turismo 6 lately, and I own a car which is intended to be driftable stock (its a Japanese coupe).  GT6 is very real, and my car handles pretty similar on GT6 and in real life.  I understand this game is about drifting, but I can't steer--the wheels constantly lose grip and end up in a low speed slide.    That's not how cars work.  Any car that cheap wouldn't rev fast enough to spin the tires constantly.I'm giving up on this one... it just isn't fun.			",6,1,1,5,0,0,3

								This game suck. If you try to drift, it automatically hold gas for you. That makes Cars almost unavalible to drift. Also its so much Pay To Win Game, almost everything cost money, or a long time of playing. Horrible graphics, even on Fantastic, and bad optimalization, i got 80fps but still spikes and lags. Unplayable with Steering Wheel (I Have DFGT and TH8A). Even worse on keyboard. Joystick is the best option, but still hard to drift with this automatic gas in steering.			",26,0,4,0,3,0,0

								This game is really god for a free to play but the way you have to get to level 8 before buying something is annyoying as ♥♥♥♥, the microtransactions should be taken out and the game should just cost money as it ruins the experiance for the people who dont want to buy coins.   The graphics are decent, and the games engine is smooth cant complain about it.It has some glitches like the inside of cars not loading and some menu screen dont get translated and come up in Russian.Another bad thing is that you need to wait a long time to repair your car.

								Dont get your hopes up to customise your car like crazy. The game does not support a tutorial to show you how to level up so you are stuck watching annoying small youtube channles in low quality to find out how to level up and get improovemants and impproove your car with extremely bad car customizing system and when creating a vinyl it is confusing and there is a lack of content or you could create a vinyl using photo shop or pain.net which is confusing and overall there are bugs every where such is in thhe map the shop and the vinyl creator its. you better wait and save your time (becuase it takes too long to figure out the mechanics) and get a decent free game. but i still play it to mess around.

								unfortunately i did never get this game to work on windows 10 pro 64. it always logged me in to the eu-server and then kicked out with the information ""disconnected from lobby"". tried it multiple times with different security-settings on my computer.i will definitely NOT lower the security-level of my computer completely e.g. by disabling the firewall even temporarily (which would be like writing my pin-number with permanent marker onto my credit-card), as some 'helpers' suggested, since other games which go via servers work out-of-the-box with the security-level i have. what a pity. the game seemed to be such a nice idea...

								This game suck. If you try to drift, it automatically hold gas for you. That makes Cars almost unavalible to drift. Also its so much Pay To Win Game, almost everything cost money, or a long time of playing. Horrible graphics, even on Fantastic, and bad optimalization, i got 80fps but still spikes and lags. Unplayable with Steering Wheel (I Have DFGT and TH8A). Even worse on keyboard. Joystick is the best option, but still hard to drift with this automatic gas in steering.			",26,0,4,0,3,0,0

								Hard to write a solid review when the game isn't complete. I'll do my best.Video - 6/10    Whenever you turn your steering wheels the smoke that comes from the wheels end up doing a graphical tearing effect.Audio - 4/10    Unoriginal soundtrack. Generic sound effects.Story - 0/10    No story, so can't review it.Gameplay - 4/10    Not a fun game to play. The car feels like it's driving on ice and it generally very hard to control. Even when the car is bone stock the car just doesn't handle correctly. Half of the store isn't finished yet as of writing this. It's just not a fun game to play.I want the developer to, well, develop the game more, honestly. I want more people in the gaming industry, I totally support the indie scene.			",121,26,5,9,19,0,9

								The Game is actually pretty good. The game is still in early access and there isnt much to do really. The garage and tuning and parts page is kinda weird. The stock car is extremely hard to hold drifts with. Purchases in game arent working for me, but this game is actually good! I think the game should stay at a free game and keep the same prices for the purchases in game. The prices are fair for what you are getting. the game is a ton of fun, and i really hope to see what a finished solid product looks like!			",42,3,4,2,1,0,0

								So much grinding in this game i feel like im playing Heroes & Generals again. Everything requires money like tires, fuel, oil, car repairs and stuff like that. Visual upgrades cost so much you gonna have to play at least 15 races for front bumper. The cars are so expensive BMW is like 2 million so every race you get about $5000 MAXIMUM so you gona need to do about 400 races if i'm not mistaking. And the physics are just bad. Most of the time you gonna be doing donuts after exiting the corner. When you brake your car goes on the side and sometimes when you go offroad you loose all your points. It's so frustrating. It would be nice if they could add some music in the game. Graphics are decent considering that this was made by Unity engine. And the game could be a bit more optimized. The smoke eats my performance. So yeah, it's just not fun.			",86,16,3,7,9,4,11

								Eh, same compliments and complaints as the rest. Beautiful aesthetics, cute attention to details (the li'l windup toy cars in the garage are ADORABLE!!!!), and great sense of humor, however, (and that's a BIG ""however,"") the foundation is a few steps behind. Keep working on that engine and the handling, and perhaps start players off with an auto transmission (or at least give tips on how to use it in the tutorial). I'd really like to see traditional handling, something akin to Ridge Racer. Also, not sure if it's part of the local humor across the pond, but as a North American player the occasional broken English seemed like it was an error. Like I said, it might just be an in-joke over there, but if that's the case, it went way over my head. I'd recommend tweaking that for NA localization. ;) Keep up the work, guys! Making games is hard, so don't take the criticism too hard, consider it as free market research and just oil the squeakiest wheel.			",8,7,1,1,1,0,2

								This is a fun little game, Though it seems free, you will evntually pay what it would normally be. The sneaky devs have laid many traps to get you to pay, from unbypassable paywalls to tempting you to use money in situations such as ""accidental"" car repairs that take hours and force you to pay. There is no matchmaking for rivals and there seems to be many hackers, Those are the cons. Other than that it is a very fun game that will eat up hours of the day. Never getting bored of the track loop and creating the perfect car with internal and external mods. This game was never meant to be a massive, popular multiplayer game. If it was less money-consuming I wouldnt've been so on the fence with this review.			",17,2,5,4,10,0,1

								Early Access is a bit too early i think. But i want this game to succeed, becuase it reminds me of Street Legal Racing: Redline. Car models are nice, but the rest of graphics are low. Handling is the biggest drawdown for this game. It does feel very weird, certainly reminds me SLR: Redline crappy handling, but after some time you can get a hang of it. It is funny, last 20 matches i did, i got like x3-10 times more scores than the other guy lol, i can get 1mil scores in the right track, and most other people get 100k-300k. That shows how hard it is to drift, even though game does assist you by steering wheels in oposite direction when you start sliding, but it is not enough.Sounds are terrible, menu is also terrible and very confusing, but i am leaving positive review just because it is very early access. I hope it does get better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is one of the singular worst games I have ever played. It may be a free game, but it is not worth the disk space it occupys. It is a waste of time. Not only is it a waste, we humans have a small time on Earth, and any second playing this game is so much of a waste you will regret playing this game on your deathbed. This game is a waste of brain cells. The physics are awful, you can't even drift. If you try to drive normally your car is if a piece of butter were to slip and slide on pure oil. This game isn't even free. It is a pay to win game that expects you to pay real money for new cars/upgrades, considering the progression on this game is incredibly slow. You could spend your money on microtransactions in this game instead on a good game, such as anything else. Even Big Rigs Over The Road Racing is a better game than this. The cars look good, but then again, thots can look good. Looks can be decieving. Out of 10, my overall score for this game is being fisted in a back allyway by a middle aged man named Pedro/10			",113,17,3,15,16,1,18

								high octane drift. whenever you suspect a free to play game making questionable things to you as gamer i see that as a double challenge - they try their tricks on me to get my money (which i, happily saying, dont have) and i try to resist because what they ask (at least at first glance) is such a small money - well, a price of sub sandwich, frankly.when youve got your first car and first race it rides like a piece of soap in a bucket of butter if you understand what im sayin - it like to drive a car with no tyres on special k - not less. you cant go straight and must catch your car and balance it - you have no time to basically think about throttle or breaks or whatever.then you decide to spend some ingame money (tickets, bucks and premium money - so its 3 currencies actually) on upgrades you suddenly discover your car transformed and rides, well, not perfectly but not terrible anymore. THEN you discover the sport tyres, the sport gasoline, the oil - you start to use them. they cost money, but with every upgrade you have less soap and more car in your, ehrm, car. WHICH takes a change of oil after every single freaking race you take - thats more money (ingame money). so thats how people start to buy premium accounts.but if you loved drifting contests in nfs underground and feel free to play a free-to-play game with 3 race tracks in it - just payin a buck a week for when you run out of tyres, or gasoline, or whatever - thats perfectly good game. pretty unbalanced, track graphics really sucks, but the cars and little possibilite to make it run better make me vote FOR this game. i dont pay money and i feel the coming of some financial struggle (ingame, sorta), so lets see.what i definitely dont like is bugs and that fukboi on a welcome screen - what the hell of a vaper he is? put some kanye kardashian there, finally!p.s. - i think ive got the worst results in this game, still looking on combo-count not road all-time and getting into accidents6.5/10			",15,2,3,0,4,0,0

								Game Pad compatible !!!! I aint going to bash that game because the concept is great, Kinda would expect more graphics wise, but for basic gameplay, it is great. Some good, hard work has gone into this game, but like I said, not for me, but try it yourself. Everyone has different taste !8.5/10 - Creativity/Customization 5/10 - Graphics7.5/10 - Controls8/10 - Gameplay7/10 - Overall Enjoyment !!!- Even though its not too much for me, Strongly reccomend for anyone who wants to play/compete.- This game has serious potential, and with some updates over time, this game could become very huge and competitive !!!

								Overall, this is a good game. Like always though there are some pros and some cons.Pros:Good GraphicsNice carsDecent PhysicsMany Upgrades and customization optionsVery Nice online communityCons:Upgrades are sometimes expensiveMoney can be very time consuming to earn and gets repetativeCars range from being affordable to over a million Rupees (The main currency in game)When drifting to earn money, you lose your points if you even just slightly wall - tap when drifting and it gets annoying when you end up losing millions of points because of somethhing that shouldnt even be counted as a crash.

								Based on the original facebook version of the game (yes, this was originally a facebook only game) I would say you should definitely wait a bit until it's a full release. It's one of the best games I've known so far.Ignore my time in this game, I'm an Australian, and the steam version only has the North America server right now.OVERALL RESULT: Seriously, just wait for the server to be made in your area before giving it a bad review.

								Not a bad little game. Pretty buggy, and it kept crashing the first few times I tried to launch it. But the physics aren't bad, and for a free game it's pretty decent. Nice selection of cars, though most of them aren't really my taste. The car mods seem pretty nice. I use a keyboard and it's really tricky, but I imagine it would be one of the best free racing games with a controller.			",21,6,2,6,5,0,1

								Was so pumped about this game, but then BAM, turned it on, chose the server, waited a minute and it froze. Awesome, just awesome, I heard pretty bad things about the P2W mechanics here and it's a shame you just put facebook mechanic here and just released it on Steam. I hope this game will become better and won't freeze.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I really like the game! I absolutely love the not-so-pay-to-win aspect. Some departments that need to be worked on are keyboard controls, better wheel adjustment, and physics. But overall 9/10 in my books! Also not very intensive and runs farely well. Only had an interesting crash issue once! If I had money I would invest in this game but great for a free game!

								Game is really addictive and fun, if you can get into it. Don't listen to reviews of people that have played the game for less than a hour or two, because this game is a grind. It's better to play this with a buddy and enjoy yourself with them, game is still in early access and graphics wise, is pretty good maxed out for unity.			",58,3,2,0,3,0,5

								Have been playing since game was plagued with crashing, not my favourite game, nor the worst game. I enjoy playing this game as a break to others, I do not play it frequently and I do not plan to.Pros:- Tons of fun to play- Controller support- Duel mode- Tons of upgrades- Livery editor- Decent amount of cheap cars- Body mods and rims- Progress through cars and upgrade kitsCons:- Terrible bugs- Hard to navigate- Car controls not like any other game- Unbeatable online players- Livery editor is impossible to use- Micro transaction currency :/- Rims cost real money to upscale- On junkyard tires card will slide too much and on upgraded tires too little, hard balance- Menus overlap other menus, causing frustration- Not nearly enough modesThis is a game for the person that doesn't care about car physics and just wants a game to just drift and have fun on. For a free game it's not too bad and for a free game it's also terrible(bug wise). I recommend you try the game since it is free and I still have fun playing it time to time.			",21,2,2,0,2,0,1

								I really think that this could be a great game, lots of potential. That being said, the physics could be polished. It's much too easy to spin out and head off the track. The graphics could also use some work but it'll do for now since the game's still in Early Access. One more thing that I should add is that the customization feels limited, body kits and rims must be bought with cash and gold and from what i've seen so far, they are bought with real money. Hope you guys will continue to patch up the game because in it's current state, it feels a bit un-playable.			",123,22,14,16,22,2,5

								I would not reccomend this game right now, as the drifting element is really hard to control the car therefore you spin out.Pro- Good menu layout for the garage- Car model is goodCon- Drifting can be a pain- Garage tutorial hint for tuning is futher down from the shop button- Tire model are a bit low res in ultra graphics- No sound option until you exit the tutorial drifting stage- Not fond of the in-game currency just yet- A bit extreme with the green markers, if you slightly tap them they still flying off into the distance- Not really seeing a MMO style game- Only in the North American region (I'm in Europe)Although I'm being negative, the game still has potential and the game is only in Early Access			",115,3,2,7,22,1,11

								I plan to update this review in the future since I'm writing this 5 days after the release. This game has so much potential, I've been a fan of car games since NFS Underground 2, or maybe Hot Pursuit 1... I really fell in love with drifting when I was playing the grid 2 campaign.Anyway, How I feel about the game is as follows:Pros:-Excelent idea with a promising future provided the devs don't let the game die like so many others have.-Plenty of users who are excited to see the game progress and develop-POTENTIAL-POTENTIAL-POTENTIALCons:-Controllers and keyboards are not able to be mapped at the same time, you have to pick one to race with.-Glitchy at times-Thrown onto steam as soon as it was remotely playable (honestly, i'm ok with this)-Too soon to tell much more (although some physics tweaks may not be such a bad idea here and there.)as long as this game doesn't become one of those pay-to-win nighmares that we've all seen before, I think we can expect to see good things in the future.

Well lets just say i wasnt lucky.I totally dont reccomend this untill it starts progressing with many bugfixes.With a pretty sh*tty tutorial aswell, This isnt worth the button you pressed, The space it takes and the memory it uses.Just spend the money to get absolute drift.0/10 Would make a serious and helpfull review for the first time never again.

They didnt learn how to drift or do anything they needed to, so instead of learning the game they went to write a bad review. Now if you stayed and played the game and learned to play you would have seen its a great game and they are still ironing out the bugs and fixing things.			",72,7,3,5,15,0,3

								Overall an alright game. Could do with a lot more improvement though. But I can't massively complain, it's in early access. There are some translation issues and it is laden with microtransactions which essentially force you to pay real money. That's really a let down. Money itself isn't that hard to get but it's really easy to spend. The upgrades are also detailed, they can be pricey however. I was using this with a keyboard and the cars are very easy to spin around. Pros:Drifting Graphics aren't terriblePhysics aren't complete rubbishIt's in early access so there's room for improvement Detailed modificationCons:Translations are off in some places. Some bits not even translatedMicrotransactions that are essentially needed unless you grind for hoursHard to be smooth with keyboardLong loading screens ",2,1,7,0,5,0,0

								Very good game! It has a big BIG potential! Lots of cars, modifications, the drifting  itself is great when you play with a controller. The only down side is that it seems to be hard to find a rival to race. But if you play with friends, you can have a lot of fun! Yes it has some bugs, but the game is free to play and in early access. I will continue to play and I can't wait to see more updates on this game :)!			",39,5,6,7,4,0,0

								I'm posting this as of Early Alpha. I Haven't played to much but let me explain why.I am playing this game with VR, and a Race Wheel.I am pretty Experienced when it comes to drifting and car games.The problems i have are simole.CONS----Cars handle unrealisticly, yes a car will slide and drift with eas if built correctly, but wheel spin is ridiculous and MPH feels fake.Expensivem they want so much to do basic tasks, if we have a garage we should have access to a garage, not pay for every single item which are usually cheap, but here are not.Graphics, most racing games focus a little more on enviorment because it has important land marks that you recognize making the tracks better, this game uses off adverts, and really gives nothing enticing.simulation? lol NopeTime, this game needs all of your free timeProDedicated Drifitng game, if the devs actually care, they could make a very popular and unique titleArtistic, cars look nice and have a good variety of modifications, if you can afford itSounds, are good, although most cars sound the same per classWorking with other people can be fun, decent communityRECOMENDATIONS TO DEVSFix over stear and under stear issues with your vehiclesGive more soundMake in game purchuses cheaperMake making money easierMore tracks (preferably mimics of real tracks)Needs gradients (hills and what not)Perfect tunes aren't perfect ( i would like some stock options)Physics, cars wont slide 400 ft if they are going ""60 mph"" MPH correction, give us Torque not MPH, and then give us correct MPH of vehicle movment on the plane...Also RPM info would be niceInterior...

								It's a good drifting game, early access, what do you expect? This is different from the others. That's why people find it hard to play. Commonly, on most ""drifting"" games, you only need to do, gas handbrake then turn, thats a drift. In this game, it's pretty complex. I rate this 7.5/10.			",27,0,4,1,5,0,2

								I really think that this could be a great game, lots of potential. That being said, the physics could be polished. It's much too easy to spin out and head off the track. The graphics could also use some work but it'll do for now since the game's still in Early Access. One more thing that I should add is that the customization feels limited, body kits and rims must be bought with cash and gold and from what i've seen so far, they are bought with real money. Hope you guys will continue to patch up the game because in it's current state, it feels a bit un-playable.			",123,22,14,16,22,2,5

								I plan to update this review in the future since I'm writing this 5 days after the release. This game has so much potential, I've been a fan of car games since NFS Underground 2, or maybe Hot Pursuit 1... I really fell in love with drifting when I was playing the grid 2 campaign.Anyway, How I feel about the game is as follows:Pros:-Excelent idea with a promising future provided the devs don't let the game die like so many others have.-Plenty of users who are excited to see the game progress and develop-POTENTIAL-POTENTIAL-POTENTIALCons:-Controllers and keyboards are not able to be mapped at the same time, you have to pick one to race with.-Glitchy at times-Thrown onto steam as soon as it was remotely playable (honestly, i'm ok with this)-Too soon to tell much more (although some physics tweaks may not be such a bad idea here and there.)as long as this game doesn't become one of those pay-to-win nighmares that we've all seen before, I think we can expect to see good things in the future.

								I would not reccomend this game right now, as the drifting element is really hard to control the car therefore you spin out.Pro- Good menu layout for the garage- Car model is goodCon- Drifting can be a pain- Garage tutorial hint for tuning is futher down from the shop button- Tire model are a bit low res in ultra graphics- No sound option until you exit the tutorial drifting stage- Not fond of the in-game currency just yet- A bit extreme with the green markers, if you slightly tap them they still flying off into the distance- Not really seeing a MMO style game- Only in the North American region (I'm in Europe)Although I'm being negative, the game still has potential and the game is only in Early Access			",115,3,2,7,22,1,11

								For everyone, keep this in mind: the game is an EARLY ACCESS, the game isn't complete or even near completion. Things will change, and at this stage is playable but you will most likely not like the state of the game right now.The graphics for the game are not too bad for a free-to-play racing game; more closely to an older racing game from 2004-2006.Loading times are between 10-15 seconds for me, not a big deal. For those who say the game takes forever to load, you might need a better computer, or better internet connection. Quit exaggerating and saying it takes 9 months to load.The controls for the game are simple (driving games usually have simple controls in general) but the in-game mechanics definitely need some work. Using the handbrake can help with drifts, but half of the time I don't even use the handbrake at all, and the car can drift just fine on its own, as long as you have some speed.I wouldn't necessarily recommend the game at this stage, but I am interested in the game and I'd like to see where the game goes in the future.It is DEFINITELY playable, not 100% obviously because it's in early access, but overall it is playable.

								It is no Doubt a Pay To Win game but here it doesent really matter if you lose. You still have a great time with other players and the costumization of the cars are INSANE! They were not joking when they said pick your own style. From custom Wraps to fly bumpers and spoilers. And man, just wait till they add bodykits. But don't expect that it'll all come for free. No no, if you don't got any money in your wallet you better keep racing och just hope someone gives you a steamcard for christmas. I have to tell you though. This game is best played with friends.

								Alright so yes there was a rocky start and the game not workign but after that 1 bad day it was fine, Alot of these bad reviews are from people who didnt take their time to learn the game. They didnt learn how to drift or do anything they needed to, so instead of learning the game they went to write a bad review. Now if you stayed and played the game and learned to play you would have seen its a great game and they are still ironing out the bugs and fixing things.			",72,7,3,5,15,0,3

								I played less then 20 mins of this before I said screw it. I thought this was more of a racing game then a FULL out drifting simmulator. Controls are more then difficult to concor without spending alot of time on it which I don't care to do. On top of that, this is a VERY heavy pay to win as well. Never seen a game want so much hard earned in game currency before in my life until now. If you're looking to goof around cause you're board, then this is the game for you. If you're thinking of playing it as a racing game that more or less a cheep need for speed, you're looking in all the wrong places.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								the game is nothing like a true drift or even race game, if your looking for a good race/drift game this isnt it. the cars do nothing but slide sideways no matter how good you or your cars gear is which means your unable to do any real drive work to add to your drift scores. the cars are impossible to control as once you get more than 10 mph the rear tires are loose and any amount of turn and your car is spinning in circles and your off the track. before those who like this game go off on me it comes down to the fact that as a longtime race/drifter player when i try to just drive the car to get used to it/the game and i can not even slow drive around a corner of the track ( the cars get sideways from about 15mph range and up ) with out the car spinning around and stopping me or it slides off the road into the grass it not a play able game. they even charge you everytime you ""practice""  so your not able to get any real time to grasp there take on drift. there i am sure is some who like this game and its sloppy sideways junk but if your not one that wants to do nothing but flip side to side just to get down a straight away of the track to then get to a corner and then flip from one side to the other 3-6 times to get thru the corner, go find another game or do like what im about to do get out the trusty need for speeds			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								physics : wonky at best, this is VERY far from simulationsound : my ears are bleeding from the sound of the car... if you can even call it thatmenu : it feels very weird, you never know where to go to do stuff ( is it too hard to make a clear part of the ""garage"" tab where you can easily swap parts from your car ? )races : barely 10 people playing at a time, so you basically have 1 gamemode available, because this game is 100% multiplayer if you want to get money atleast f2P ? : yeah, meh, there are quite a few parts, but a fair few are buyable only through their premium currency. Freetoplay currency is VERY long to get a hold of. even by winning tandems with over 10M+ points you get the same amount ( 5000 ) as someone winning by 1 point over, so it does not feel rewarding at all for good work f2P currency is also buyable with real money, and it is very cheap ( around 50K for 0.35€ ) but most cars for example are either around 100K, so basically buyable through normal playing, or strictly over 1M+, meaning you're just gonna have to buy money to get these, pretty slimey to be fair. It almost feels like this game has 3 currencies, F2P currency, you can buy about 3 cars and maybe a dozen upgrades, and then premium f2P currency, it's the same inside the game, but the amounts to buy stuff just mean you need to pay up, and then the usual premium currency where some parts/cars are ONLY obtainable by paying, pretty ♥♥♥♥ing stupid3/10 game , funny for a few minutes, and gets very boring very fast because of the grind to buy stuff			",56,2,6,5,8,0,1

								Its an eh game right now. I understand its a free to play game and i'll keep that in mind. Its a no right now but ill definitely come back later down the....drift.     Right now theres not much to do other than spin out on the track trying to get a hold of the controls and MAD DRIFTS! There's no sound track in the game so its pretty boring unless you get some fire on a playlist. I tried to pimp my ride but that♥♥♥♥♥♥might as well be in brail cause its dificult as hell to use. The mulitplayer isnt great either. Just a bunch of people trying to drift but looking like that white dude in Tokyo drift.      ATM i won't play it any further till they slap some makeup on it and polish it up. You could get it and get some time in getting used to the drifting to become the next DK. I got high hopes for this game cause i love racing games but got no money to buy them.    ",35,0,1,6,0,0,1

								Definitely has potential. Pros:Graphics not bad. Many car options.Very specific and good tuning system.Cons:Half the game doesn't work.Other half of game needs real money to be spent.Car controls are awfully difficult, maybe I'm just bad at it.Following that, already a cheater in the game, gained 18 million points in a drift event with the starter car. Overall, a good starting point, but it has a very very long road infront of it.			",23,0,3,1,2,0,0

								Even though it's early access, this game has a great foundation its very playable on both controller and keyboard. If your friends like drifting as well the multyplayer fun stuff servers are really great for running tandems. The community for the most part if very welcoming and at all hours you can find poeple to drift with.  The developers seem listen to their players every day when it comes to getting rid of bugs!!! (so post them on the forums!)Pros- great physics- smooth controls easy to learn, nice and difficult to master- multiple camera views (including cockpit)- stable multiplayer servers- nice graphics- good community - 10/10 Development team!!!- Free to play If you dont want a specific car or tunings - a huge selection of cars and mods- many great engines that can be swaped - A great game to support, money I've spent spent on the game im very satisfied with and my garage is at 10 deep with space for 2  ;) - very satisfying sounds- There are at all times, people to drift with!!! cons- the starter car is one of the hardest to learn it seems  (a positive way to think of it is, this will give you great control when you get your first car- a few bugs here and there (thats what we are in early access for though, so help the developers know about the bugs you experience.

								There is no native controller support wtf. When you try to map them, the input on the keyboard menu changes with the joypad menu. This game is only halfway though out. And don't even try to play with the wheel. How do you expect me to drive let alonee drift with a keyboard, where you either turn the steering wheel 100% or non at all. Driving is not linear like the controls on the keyboard. It makes the game unplayable. FIX this people.			",75,3,6,4,5,0,0

								Controls are actually pretty great, found out where the controller settings are.Only gripes are:-The practice track has a time limit and uses up resources to get in.-While in-game, you can't open the options menu to adjust things like control mapping.-When setting up the controls for my Xbone controller, the triggers got swapped. Dunno why. And because the of reason number 2, I couldn't fix it in-game and wasted 10 tires and fuel having to leave and fix it in menu.Otherwise, pretty great game so far, looks extremely promising if they just iron out some small kinks and work to make it even better in the future.

								If you love car games, even better if you are in to drifting, then.. THEN, this game will be fun for you.I personaly love drifting games, and i feel like the developers here are on to something realy good.Of course its only out on early access, but still i have ton of fun and chill times in this game.Havnt encountered to many ""game breaking"" bugs yetHense the early access you may see features that wont work yet, thats becouse its a work in progress.Also; If you try this game (wich is free!!!) dont expect to be doing ken block style drifting in your starter car.You will need to upgrade your engine or at least do some grinding to earn credits and make your car a living beast as i have done. it is rly fun! you can almost feel every engine part upgrade you do.1 negative  part of this game is that since its free, its bound to have some mini transaction.I feel like they could tone this down abit, so it wont be pay to get the coolest car or whatever.Maby do pay to get awesome skins to your car.7/10 for an early access drift game (not many good ones out there)			",53,11,3,3,24,3,10

								Overall I think this game has potential. The art style is nice, handling is unique all though it takes time to master it. Only thing is that the engine damage and tire and gassoline usage makes me anxsious about saving money and pushes me away from enjoying the game. I'd like to freely drive and not worry about if i'll get the parts i want.			",67,3,5,3,3,0,0

								Sh!t game when you dont keep track of every little f+cking thing to do with your car. your engine comepletely breaks and requiers constant attention and money. if you are looking for a good free to play game..... look elsewhere. completee waste of time and if you dont have endless pockets of money you cant get anywhere. my advice to the developers. make the car parts last longer and also make sure the cars dont use as much fuel as they do.

								Controls are actually pretty great, found out where the controller settings are.Only gripes are:-The practice track has a time limit and uses up resources to get in.-While in-game, you can't open the options menu to adjust things like control mapping.-When setting up the controls for my Xbone controller, the triggers got swapped. Dunno why. And because the of reason number 2, I couldn't fix it in-game and wasted 10 tires and fuel having to leave and fix it in menu.Otherwise, pretty great game so far, looks extremely promising if they just iron out some small kinks and work to make it even better in the future.

								My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			",31,4,1,5,8,0,1

								high octane drift reviewthe game is ok,in my opinion its a good game for drifting. the controls take a few minutes to get used to though and the physics make it hard to drift causing your car to spin out a lot. the game is very expensive because its meant to cost money,so as free game its pay as you go.meaning everything is expensive (everything in high octane drift is too expensive basicailly).i like how the game has variety of customization features,it has much more customaization features than other drifting games so far.high octane drift has a variety of cool features ,you can sign contarct sponsorships and get double the money when the contract ends you can also get the sponsorship designs.in the game one faeture everybody misses out is that the altezza is not the only car in the game you can get much more cars even cutomized cars.(customized car cost emeralds ,you get 1 emearld every time you level up so getting them is hard).there is a variety of drifting tracks which is nice to see the graphics are ok ,the graphics are probally like this to keep lag down though.i am currently playing the game to see  its features and i have seen that not a lot of people play this game because of the starter car (the altezza),i can clearly see why because the altezza constantly spins out.this is why it took my weeks just to learn how to drfit basicailly if i had another car i probably could of took days.the gamemodes are fun to ,practice is graet but im warning you it costs you 500 to go practice plus ten tires and oil,i don not like how practice costs money . i have also played this game on a computer from 2013 and it runs fine except for  when you go in free roam with other players.this is when it lags hard ,it would be nice to know how many people where on one free roam game there should honetsly be a chart telling you.customization for wraps are cool but to get them it requires too much stuff and is advance and confusing,another good thing is that the game trys you with 59 achievements ive even seen a achievement based on pokemon in high octane drift this achievement was called ""gotta catch 'em all""if you dont want to start off with the altezza after the intro do the following steps1.go to shop and click on cars2.in there go my cars and press sell car3.the altezza should sell for 33k leaving you with 83k (altezza normally costs 66k,sells for half of price,also buy tune kit 1 for 3 greens)4.you should be able to buy 4 cars a old bmw e63 (63k),altezza (66k,just dont buy it!!!),nissain 240sx(73k and 100 percent reccomended by me) and last the mazda rx-8 (83k)5.now buy one of 4 cars tune kit for greens.(the more expensive the car the more greeens tune kit 1 cost)this game is not all the best and is not going to be the best as i know that the team who created this game is very small and its a big project for them,so atleast high octane drift has a potentially good looking futurein conclusion...if you are new to steam and looking for a free racing game/free drifting simulator then this is perfect youmy opininon of this game is a mixed thoughWARNING ADAVNCED REVIEW FOR PROS ON HIGH OCTANE DRIFT UNDER HERE			",11,0,12,0,2,0,0

								I really like the game! I absolutely love the not-so-pay-to-win aspect. Some departments that need to be worked on are keyboard controls, better wheel adjustment, and physics. But overall 9/10 in my books! Also not very intensive and runs farely well. Only had an interesting crash issue once! If I had money I would invest in this game but great for a free game!

								Have been playing since game was plagued with crashing, not my favourite game, nor the worst game. I enjoy playing this game as a break to others, I do not play it frequently and I do not plan to.Pros:- Tons of fun to play- Controller support- Duel mode- Tons of upgrades- Livery editor- Decent amount of cheap cars- Body mods and rims- Progress through cars and upgrade kitsCons:- Terrible bugs- Hard to navigate- Car controls not like any other game- Unbeatable online players- Livery editor is impossible to use- Micro transaction currency :/- Rims cost real money to upscale- On junkyard tires card will slide too much and on upgraded tires too little, hard balance- Menus overlap other menus, causing frustration- Not nearly enough modesThis is a game for the person that doesn't care about car physics and just wants a game to just drift and have fun on. For a free game it's not too bad and for a free game it's also terrible(bug wise). I recommend you try the game since it is free and I still have fun playing it time to time.			",21,2,2,0,2,0,1

								If CSR was about drifting and on PC.If you like F2P games, this game is for you.If you like the drifting in Juiced 2, this game is for you.If you like being mid drift, hitting a wall, and keeping your points, this game is for you.If you like to hit crowds of people with your Mustang, this game is not for you.Drifting is hit or miss. Sometimes when trying to set up a line proper, you lose control in the middle of setup and somehow get 10,000 points. Other times you set up the line you want, try to take it seriously, and end up not getting any points until halfway thus leaving you with 2,000 points. Free to play model is here, and it's steep. Customization options look nice. They basterdized the way the AE86 looks, among other vehicles.Spend the 10.99 on Peak Angle and get a complete drifting game that is solid for PC.			",34,2,6,1,4,0,4

								I wanted to give this game an honest try but after 3 practice rounds of not being able to make one solid turn without oversteering or flipping around like it is a Iced Over NASCAR track I had to give up. Great progress made so far for only being on version 0.3 of your game.But please add controler support and save of the trouble of using the DEVS modded Assetto Corsa control scheme.

								Read all of the other reviews. They all say the same exact things. The handling in this game is absolute trash. GTA V has  more realistic drifting. (That's saying something).			",55,1,4,10,1,0,0

								10/10 best car game out there in 2016.For some reason the developer has decided to use boat handling for the cars which is really innovative and makes the game really fun to play.			",48,6,4,2,1,0,1

								This game isn't actually too bad, first was plagued by the crashing when trying to load up but seems that has been fixed and I can now actually play...My only problem with this game is one that many before me have pointed out. The pricing of upgrades and stuff is way too high, i mean 75k just for a front bumper? Its just a grind fest to get something new...other than that its not bad for a free game.			",31,0,3,3,1,0,2

								Overall I enjoyed a little bit of the time that I spent in the game. The drifting was fun but there are a few problems. Obviously, the graphics are not that great but its a free game so I'm not complaining. Though the wait time to find opponents was annoying. The major thing wrong with this game is the microtransactions. EVERYTHING that you really was the price is EXTREMELY high. I understand they have to make money but this was just overkill. I would have paid a few buck for this game if they just had reasonable prices on it or just not have jacked up in game prices 1000% Feels like a phone game with all of the microtransactions			",54,20,12,5,13,3,5

								Its ok but the starter car is crap. it high revs at 2nd gear and throw you off the coarse. and no its not that I suck but read the other reviews about the starter car. Im not the only one experincing this. other than that, great potential for a car game. NEEDS MORE F2P CARS (LIKE PAYING FOR IT WITH INGAME MONEY NOT REAL MONEY)!!!!!			",19,0,3,0,1,0,0

								This game is great for drifters. There is still a bunch of bugs, but still a good game. Yeah the sounds are pretty bad and only a few maps, but once you get the hang of it and can deal with bad sound its pretty fun.			",90,2,3,12,10,0,5
