YouTube™ Video: Island Racer Gameplay (PC HD)

			Island Racer pc gameplay walkthrough (no commentary). Playlist: https://goo.gl/znVwxh Steam Indie Game Download: http://store.steampowered.com/app/569010/ ""Island Racer is a casual racing video game...		

Not the worst racing game I've ever played, just too much I dislike. No options whatsoever, video, controls, nothing. Resolution seems to be upscaled from 1024, pop-ins happen at a short distance and making matters worse I had some bad fps spikes.  Didn't test multiplayer, required to make a login so I'm not sure if it's compatible between platforms or had anyone playing. Two themed islands were available, mediterranian and tropical. Tracks can be generated using off and onroad options, couldn't customize further. 8 selectable cars with choice of manual gears, all handled reasonably well with keyboard, gamepad and mouse. While the world may be open most trees and fence posts brought me to a grinding halt, no damage model exist and the physics outside of driving are quite comedic. Hate to sound so negative but I just don't see myself playing much more. Highlights being the car models, soundtrack and feel of drifting. Personally I think the price should be lower given the lack of care porting the game. Without some patches I would give Island Racer a 'halfway' vote which unfortunately doesn't exist. Cheers.

												Really weird controls, but adds to the fun when you play it with a friend or two :)			",31,0,2,0,3,0,0
