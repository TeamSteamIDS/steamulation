												For this price, you really can learn a lot. For real driving. I mean,  parking( in real life, it's very important).So instructive!!!			",7,2,50,1,2,0,0

												I bought this to entertain a small child..... turns out it is one damn fine game.... Requires a fine touch and patience.  Some achievements would be nice and a choice of vehicles, but a solid solid game, well worth the money			",15,2,4,1,8,0,1

												Great game; brilliantly simple and rewardingly hard.Has some controller support, but it could be better (joy2key is an easy remedy, though).Why aren't more people talking about this game?			",232,59,4,29,15,1,32

												Very hard game. I didn't think driving would be this hard. If I did tests for my driving license, I think I would crash a few times. Overall a fun but stressful game. :(			",19,0,1,1,1,0,0

YouTube™ Video: Retro Parking First Look Review  - PLAY for Pennies 

			Views: 197		

			Welcome to Sim UK. This Retro Parking Review on PC is part of the ""PLAY for Pennies"" Playlist where I select, purchase and review PC games which are less than £5 to purchase.		

 PROS=====It has a VDUB in it!The car itself is nicely modelled.There are a lot of levels and they are all challenging.As you progress the challenges evolve and expand making it tougher.It's reasonably priced.GREAT Music track, I like it anyways :-)Addictive (kinda) CONS======The car sound OMG!!!!!!!! Terrible, horrendous!It's not the best Mobile->PC Port I have seen.Controller setup is clunky, poorly worded and annoying.Controls are not great, sharp turning and reversing especially.No Timer, no replay entertainment value. Play once, throw away.No controller support for wheels (not that I have yet figured anyway)No 1st person view.Rushed maps, lots of gaps you can cheat through.The camera angle and the camera controls, nasty :-(It has a great idea and with some work it could be a really, really great game.  For £2 what can you expect and when you put it like that it's OK I guess and it is KINDA addictive, until you get too annoyed with the controls and camera angles that is.Overall score:  45/100			",50,26,20,0,51,1,8

												Controls could be better, e.g. analog throttle and brake on gamepad triggers. Physics are not good enough, e.g. car is still working when driving off some wheels on high ground and some barriers do not have proper hitboxes.I'm missing a few interesting game modes like time attack (earning medals like in TrackMania and with optional worldwide highscores) or penalties for hitting cones instead of an instakill. So far I haven't seen any fields that force you to drive forward or backwards, which would add another challenge to some levels.If you like this kind of parking games I highly recommend ""Trucks & Trailers"" from SCS Software,  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very addicting game if you are into these parking type games. There is 200 levels to last you a while. However, the game does get a little boring after you play it for a long time. But i got it on sale for $0.49, so totally worth it if you ask me.			",67,14,6,7,6,0,2
