												I REALLY like this one. Its more than a hover space craft race thing. Which of course it is. But the added weapon elements, and extras make it quite intense if you really want to go full on. Race, crash into, blow up and destroy etc opponents and aim to win as well. Great!  The graphics are pretty good, should get good results even with a low end graphics card.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game really has the feel of star wars pod racing. You can pick up power-ups that can affect the gameplay of the match. It can get a little frustrating in the begging to drive each vehicle. The graphics are alright and fun to look at. The opponents can be very stupid at times and run into the walls. The game is a good arcade racer with potential to be alot of fun. I would recommend this game to any racer that likes having power-ups to blow the competition away. Its a good game but can be improved.			",3025,1130,139,313,428,33,475

												Let's turn an RPG into a racer!Yep believe it or not. This is what happened. A.I.M Racing is a follow on in the series of 'A.I.M' (not yet ported to steam) and 'A.I.M 2' which can be found here...Both of which I had never heard of before. Basically the story set up in these versions is that mankind was playing around with artificial intelligence and creating mobile war machines called 'gliders' which were in turn controlled by artificial brains in a capsule called 'mechminds'. Each generation produced a more complicated and sophisticated 'mechmind' and the 5th generation was considered to be the most superior. All this testing was done covertly on a planet known as 'Polygon 4'. Eventually because of various milestone events, the future construction of these war machine gliders were abandoned and the location of this planet a forgotten fairy tale. However the assembly line itself and the testing facility was still fully operational and the testing protocols as dictated in its programming was still active. Hence the planet itself was still testing the mechminds to see which was the most advanced in warfare and racing as set up in its programming parameters. Only once that answer had been obtained would the system 'shut down' or enter into a sleep phase.The mechanics of the game itself will remind you of Star wars Pod Racing mixed with the unfair elements of maybe Mario Kart SNES. You see the ai that you race are developed on purpose to be unfair, with the ability to be able to catch up unrealistically and to be able to overpass you at that single moment in time when you’re about to cross the finishing line in first place. So if you want a relaxing enjoyable experience and time to learn the controlling, I strongly suggest placing it on 'easy' so that you can at least unlock every level without needless constant repeats because of the unfair ai on the other difficulties and absolutely impossible ai to beat on the insane difficulty.There are 30 gliders and 16 different locations that you will eventually be able to unlock. The most superior glider will only be made available at the very end and already has its speed upgraded to the max. So since you are given a limited amount of upgrade options you may wish to place it on the various facets that the last glider lacks. Why? This is because once an upgrade is chosen, it can’t be undone and applies to all gliders from that point on. So perks such as strength, firepower or handling which the last glider lacks, will seriously help you in being triumphant against the last level which even on 'easy' setting is a trolling experience against unfair ai. The landscapes themselves are quite versatile from one another and always will inspire you with wonderment as you speed across the various alien projections. The locations will test your ability to drive when confronted with bright light, extremely narrow passages, sharp turns and well timed navigation through or around various obstacles. Each location seems to have a unique test to it, even the open basic track can be very testing as you’re now confronted with the fact that the ai can easily gun you down with rockets and splatter fire. Each location was also made unique by each having its own specific original soundtrack to accompany it adding again to an imaginative universe.You really can see a fair amount of time was put into this, but there are a number of blaring issues that need to be mentioned to.* There are quite a few areas where you can simply drive off the map. The game just freezes your glider into a trapped small area but you never respawn back on the map, instead many times you will need to restart.* Controlling can be really obnoxious on some of the gliders especially if your wing tips hit something or your forced to go into a tube like you do in an underwater level as most gliders can't handle the sudden change of navigation at all and will be flipping all over the place.* Ai that just sticks with you regardless of whether you go slowly or fast does not make a good racing game.* There’s not really a lot you can do when the ai in the harder difficulties are hot on your tail. Their splatter harassment and rocket launching will be deadly accurate with practically no warning attached. To evade their pursuit seems fruitless and more an inevitable mechanic of the programming. While other games often add defensive weapons, this game only offers offensive ones.* There isn't many shortcuts you can take, most of the tracks are just standard routes, offering no versatility in travel routes.* While multiplayer options are available no servers are maintained by developer or publisher so the game is more a solo experience.* No achievements.Regardless of all these gripes, because of its low price and imaginative landscapes I did enjoy the several hours I spent on this game. Granted it’s not a ‘great’ racer, but it is one that at least kept me entertained for a day or two.Developer: http://www.skyriver.ru/index.phtmlMontage of various levels of the game:

			A pod racing game with similar unfair racing mechanics as super mario kart where your opponents are always able to catch up and pass you just at the last second.

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Racing game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou can have different profile slots with different names.There is a difficulty settings.There are alot of resolution sizes available.There is a sound volume slidebar available.There is a music volume slidebar available.You are able to change the controls on the keyboard.You are able to play with your controller/Wheel and joystick.Multiplayer is Host based and it requires IP Ports.About the game.If you are familiar with the star wars racing on the N64. This is almost the same and you pretty much know what to expect. However it is still different. Each ship has their own stats and attributes and firepower! You can also choose a different color on the ship. One thing that i have noticed. If a Computer player is ahead of you, they most likely will stay ahead and there is no way to catch them up. Weapon pick ups - rockets, mines. They all have a different button. So if a rocket requires button A then a mine requires button B.Controls aren't super good.Bad music.Graphics are old.Needs to unlock other road tracks.The map on the top right looks messy. There is just TOO MUCH DETAIL to see the actual road.When computer Ai's are ahead, they usually stay ahead. Don't worry, THEY WILL CATCH UP.Other things.-------------------I Give this game a 3/10			",462,169,6,45,48,1,62

												woah this game is toughIts a great game well optimized (can run on the worst rotten potatoes)and has a real arcedy vibe.I played very similar games on machines and had fun.This was no differentyou travell at high speeds knocking on your opponents weird♥♥♥♥♥car and collect powerups ranging from afterburner time (nitro)to missiles.The one major con which can throw people off is the control scheme for keyboards.Its just not good for the mechanisms.You can change it but there are too many buttons to press in this ride that its difficult to keep trackso i recommend using a joystick8/10 for the lowly measly price they charge just buy it without hesitation.

												The controller bindings are terrible.I was forced to steer, accelerate, and brake, all on the left joystick.  Setting up different buttons did not help.This game would be playable if the controls were updated to work better with the common Xbox controllers.Graphics were alright, and I would probably leave this installed for a time killer game, but the controls ruined it for me.Looked like a decent Wipeout clone. :/ ",480,150,19,94,19,4,38

												Pod racing without any annoying kids! The awkwardly named A.I.M. racing is a wipeout style racing game where you pilot a hovercraft around a series of race tracks. There are power ups and game modes.cons-rough round the edges-unbalanced-controls are odd-feels mostly slow-tracks not well designed or interestingpros-feels kind of fast sometimesNot recomended unless you need tp play a poor wipeout knock off 2 /5			",1733,561,64,200,227,23,325

												Avoid like the plague. It's very bland and generic. It controls like crap. You often come to complete stops. All the tracks except one are locked and I couldn't even beat that first one. It's just incredibly tough and your blaster is totally underpowered. Probably the worst 3d racer I've ever played.			",1440,723,54,194,106,12,193
