												Oh my god this game is terrible. First off, the guy you're controlling looks like he's dead and someone glued his arms and legs to the bike and is remotely controlling it. That's the only explanation I can think of. Basically we have horrible controls, repetitive gameplay, terrible music, and a game that's mind numbingly boring with zero substance or anything that makes you want to play for more than an hour. There's also some weird physics which appear to be like goat simulator however this game is 100000000x worse than goat simulator and it's a complete insult to that game. Do not waste your money on this pile of crap and if you did then get a refund at once because this game is not worth any amount of money. It is an absolute failure of a game.			",34,12,0,3,1,0,0

""The Dev of this game deserves to become a deserter""A lost town in war. You escape just with a motorcycle followed by guards in armored vehicles. Your controls are A (left) + D (right) + Space (break/boost). Your motorcycle is permanently moving and distance is calculated by time (lol wtf?). Holy crap how hard it is to just turn around. Collect the golden hearts, drive as long as you can and use the boost ramps to perform some jumps. The big goal is to cleanup the destroyed city from scrap to move to the next destroyed city. Boring & grinding and only a few challenging achievements. But also the least matching soundtrack evar - Cello, the brain eater.			",1637,665,58,135,164,17,216

												This game is garbage, I have all of the achievements (don't ask me why). -Turning too hard means that you'll lean against the ground and start going straight. -Some of the characters aren't able to go over jumps without crashing. -Unlocks will sometimes give you characters and vehicles that you already have. -There are spelling errors all over the game-There is not really any settings available (Space bar is brake/drift, there is no list of controls)If you do end up playing it anyway, like I did, and want to get all the achievements: The easiest way is to go towards the far right corner from where you start (will not be available immediately, some rubble will need to be cleared) and there is a golden statue of an anime girl. Running in to this statue will unlock her as a character, her name is Query-chan, she is the only character that holds on to the bike properly, if you get her on the drone, she is essentially invincible and you can do whatever you need to.

												Insanely boring. These sort of simulators are supposed to have poor controls which add to the humor level of the player's failure. I get that, but the whole time I was playing this I was making the same face as the rooster in my avatar. I had a truck jump up & land on the rider's back. The truck then proceeded to ride me & my scooter for a street block, until we all crashed into a wall. Seems humorous? Not at all, stoic rooster face intact.The majority of rounds end with you basically parked against a wall or object. Collisions should result in calamity.There are no control settings. You are left to figure it out for your own. Which is ok unless things change for no reason. I played a few rounds & found that pressing select on my controller would do a fast round reset. Somehow after about 10 rounds that stopped working & the start button (which did nothing earlier) now functioned as a return to main menu. From the main menu I was able to load the next round.The BGM is torturous - nuff said about that.Also why the hell does it say ""trial version"" in the bottom right of a game I payed for?Refund requested. Now I'm going to go back to doing something fun, like ripping my pubes out with a pair of pliers.			",819,184,6,73,31,7,49

												I felt compelled to write some sort of review of my own, after having read some of the posted reviews concerning this product. To be perfectly honest, it is definitely not worth the full sale price of $9.99 -- I bought it for $0.99 and I feel like, for that kind of price, it definitely was worth it. I could see the developers realistically charging maybe something like $3.00.In terms of gameplay, if you love ""ragdoll-physics"" games, then this could be worth adding to your collection but I wouldn't expect anything near the level of ""depth"" when compared to the very popular Goat Simulator, etc.The bikes are extremely hard to control. Typically, your rider has a very hard time just staying on his bike, let alone clearing jumps and collecting ""peace points"". However, this level of difficulty does not/did not leave me feeling frustrated or potentially enraged. Due to the simplicity of your objectives -- clearing rubble throughout town (simply by staying on the bike for as long as you possibly can) collecting peace points, and hitting ramps/speed-boosts -- it's actually, at least for me, incredibly relaxing. The game simply doesn't expect very much from you. Surgeon Simulator, on the other hand, frustrated me a lot faster, to the point that I simply stopped playing/lost interest (I'll just stick with Trauma Center).Eventually, controlling some of the bikes gets easier and some of the riders are better for maintaining a good grip on your bike (example: Ninja), allowing you to hit those jumps, etc.I feel like it's a funny game, as most ""ragdoll-physics"" games usually are. I don't get people that would bother, after having surveyed all the rest of the content on the internet on a daily basis, being ""offended"" by the extreme vagary of plot in this game.

												This game has a lot to answer for, especially for increasing my blood pressure. The rider on the bike is clearly asleep as at times you can have a slight bump into a tree and he gives up. Surely any sensible person would turn it slightly more. The music is incongruous and the wonky physics are not as fun as Goat Simulator. However I did have fun in an odd way. I made a video of my play through so if you want to take a look before buying:
