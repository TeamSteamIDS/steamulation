												This game is drugs. The computer is drugs. Your hands are drugs.The controls are not simple. They build in complexity rather quickly, and it always feels like you're just barely able to keep your head above water. You will be kept in a perpetual state of not-drowning-just-yet. But every once in a while, you hook a pair, lance immediately, and hook your next without thinking about it. You get flying along, jumping from one pair to the next, not thinking. Not seeing or hearing. You are experiencing.And three seconds later, you're ruined. But for those three seconds, you knew what it was to be a god. And god was drugs.			",368,93,7,27,21,3,22

												INDIE GAME OF THE DECADE!!! OMG, how did this gem slip by under the radar? I can’t even believe this game was developed on the id Tech 4 (Doom 3) game engine. Oh how I envy the developers so much. This is one of those moments where I’d say, “I wish I made a game like this!”They did something incredible with the music in this game. I’ve always been seeking one where the music is completely dynamic based on the actions you take or do. By dynamic I mean you have a base rhythm but can add instruments at any interval and make it sound just like one musical masterpiece. And this game achieves this!I swear sometimes, I feel like I’m even making my own music when playing this game. And it’s the only game I know where if you crash into an enemy and slow down or whatever … it just sounds and looks so cool! Tell me how many games out there make you want to do mistakes like taking damage? LOL … none right? Wrong! Dyad …Quite a chill and psychedelic trance type of music in this game. So for those that don’t like that genre I can see that may be something like half the greatness gone. But lucky for me I love this type of genre of music.I find the gameplay progressive. I’m not comparing, but if we take a look at other indie games like, Beat Hazard or Audio Surf, the gameplay and rules just doesn’t change at all. In Dyad, it’s progressive. New enemies, objects and variations to how you move are introduced throughout what I would call the campaigns. And it's not annoying, it's very fun!I rate this game 12/10. I wish I was sitting on a couch playing this game next to sauce and just speaking my mind just like in the trailer. It’s bloody hilarious! Watch it! But seriously I can see how this game can make one do something like that.EDIT: Changed my mind about not liking the chargers after playing Just Take a Pinch level. They're awesome in combination with invincibility shields. Also corrected that the dudes in the trailer aren't the Dev's, but they're funny as heck!I would also like to elaborate on my second paragraph. This game is the inverse to games like Beat Hazard, Audio Surf, Symphony ... etc. The thing about those games is you see visuals customized or laid out to variations in your music. With Dyad, the music is has been customised to the way you play. So everytime you hook an enemy, graze, lance, pick up an invincibility shield, ride a zipline ... it activates a sound effect that seemlessly blends in with the background music. Don't get me wrong, the visuals are definately a big part of the game and is in dynamic sync with the music, but I was kind of dissapointed with The Cynical Brit's video on Dyad where he basically commentated about everything except the sound. You really have to have an ear for Dyad ... kinda like Osu! ... it's not just about visually interacting, you need to hear the rhythm. imho.Also the infinite level is genius. I was avoiding it for a bit because I thought it really was infinite. But one day I wanted to chill and just started played it expecting no ending. But surprise! It's like the equivalent to having a story-like conclusion to a game without a story ... lol.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The audiovisuals are one of the most hypnotic trips you can have without melt your brain or breaking the law.

												DYAD is an amazing psychedelic experience. The seamless blending of its mechanical, visual, and aural styles transport you through transcendental dimensions in a ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" style. A great game for fans of psychedelia, electronic music, and challenging games. It is best played with headphones and an analogue controller.Favourite level: Giraffes? Giraffes!

												It may have only taken me 2 hours to beat the whole thing, but I can safely say this is probably one of my favorite games ever.It's everything it promises to be - psychadelic, mind-bending, and hallucinogenic, while also being engaging, reasonably challenging and having a solid mechanical foundation and gameplay.First of all, it does a great job of easing you into the game as it adds new mechanics. It starts out simple to let you learn and ramps up from there. There's really only ever 4 buttons to worry about, too: left and right, hook, and lance. The fact that it is so simple control-wise means it's that much easier to feel immersed in the game and not worry about what your hands are doing.That's hardly what makes it great, though. Each level feels like a unique audio-visual experience. In order to complete level goals, you have to be constantly looking ahead down the ""pipe"". As you perform certain actions, the visuals AND audio react accordingly. The fact that you have to be watching in a certain way and processing what is happening visually, all while everything is changing and responding to what you are doing, is what makes this such a psychadelic, engaging experience.If you're used to arcade-style games where the focus is on precise, responsive controls and clearly defined, easy-to-read game state, you might feel put off by the idea of this game at first. Everything is constantly moving and waving around and oscillating, which you would think would make it hard to keep track of what is happening. As far as I can tell, though, this is intentional and doesn't hurt your ability to start to gain mastery over the game. As the game state changes (for example, as you speed up), the way you need to visually process and respond to the game changes as well, and the visuals and audio respond to keep feeding you the information you need.The ""ending"" is a huge treat; an audio-visual dessert which somehow manages to top the psychadelic experience of each of the levels.Once you've played through the game, there's plenty of replayability playing through individual stages to get to the top of the leaderboards and competing with your friends or the general public, going for trophies, or even just enjoying the remix mode. However, it seems the friends leaderboard isn't functional (at least for me), so I was a little disappointed by that. Also, the leaderboards don't seem to let me scroll to the next page, so I can only ever see the top 20 or so scores in the world. Perhaps this will get fixed later.Definitely get this game unless you are concerned about the overwhelming visuals causing diziness or something like that (it wasn't a problem for me and I get motion sickness pretty easily).

												TL;DR This game game can become really messy for your eyes, make sure to play in a well lit room or RIP eyes. Also I have no idea how to play with a keyboard. Besides those two little problems, Dyad is a really interesting game. It becomes pretty addictive once you really get into it because there are so much things that get added in the gameplay as you play. But I'd like a option to have the game running on ""Windowed no borders"". It'd be super.Let's get into things. In Dyad, you basically are a little... non identified thing with kinda tentacles (just what I think, maybe it has a name) and you must grab onto ""enemies"" being little light orbs. You must make pairs of enemies that are the same colors to boost your speed and get more points. That's basically the base of the game.But it's not only that. Sometimes, you just need to make pairs and finish the level. Sometimes, it's a race and you need to finish is in less time as possible. Buuut, you can also start to ""graze"" the enemies by grabbing them. A circle will appear around them and then you just need to pass close to them. This'll build up a ""lancing"" bar, then you'll be able to ""lance"" on the enemies. This is like a super boost and you can hit the enemies like that to go faster and make the lancing last longer (I think? I'm not sure about this)Those are the only things I tried so far. There must be some other modes and special things to do. Also the music and sounds are really great.Since I always have my game controller plugged, I still haven't figured out how to play with a keyboard. But the experience with the controller is really enjoyable and easy to play. You just need the buttons and left joystick. And fingers. And hands. And eyes. And a brain. You get it.This is the kind of game you'll want to play a level over and over again to master it and get a high score (at the time I'm writing this I hit the 9th place of a level on the global leaderboards after trying a level a few times). The fact that you can edit the way you play the levels after finishing them once (""remix"") is really interesting and I really like it. You can even play a non-ending game just to, like, relax or practice without being scared of a game over or the end of the level. But I don't know what some of the things do though.If you're epileptic this is not the game you want to play at all. As you play, the colors and lights become more intense. I myself am not someone who's really sensitive to that, but at one point I had to take a break because it was too much. I couldn't even play the damn level anymore (the game reminded me of Super Hexagon. Must take breaks while playing this or you just slowly become crazy). Also I'm someone who tends to change windows a lot when I play (to take breaks and all) and when it's full screen it tends to freeze the game and sometimes make it crash. An option to have the game windowed but without borders would be really cool. I don't want to touch the launching options because I don't know if it works just like TF2.After this kinda novella I can only say ""Yes, I recommend this game"".			",49,9,2,4,7,1,1

												A nice experience that feels more like a drug trip than anything else. There isn't really that many levels, but remix and trophy modes are fun to ♥♥♥♥ around with. One problem it has is that there barely any options and there isn't much you can do to reduce the colours that fly at you, so long play sessions can probably cause some eye damage, seeing as I've already gotten some eye strain from Dyad. Overall, a really nice game that is sort of a... tunnel racer(?) and reminds me of Rez a little bit.Worth the discounted price by far, but the $15 is a hit or miss. Personally, I'd reccomend you buy it when on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dyad is just insanity disguised as some Tempest-esque racer, while Super Hexagon is insanity disguised as .... dodging things in concentric circles?  There's not much to say about these games other than few other games have lured me into a ""zone"" as quickly as these two.  Perhaps it's the gameplay that requires your undivided attention and reflexes, or perhaps it's the energetic music pumping into your ears... whatever the case, these simple games offered hours of enjoyment without the need for any real carrot on a stick other than the old-fashioned high score.  Not many games can do that for me anymore.			",687,272,23,99,56,7,113

												Dyad is a colorful, but difficult, experience. It's what I like to call a tunnel racer, even though it's not always a racer, strictly speaking. These tunnels are filled with enemies in different colors. Linking two of these enemies together will give you a speed boost and grazing these enemies will fill up your Lancer meter. The Lancer meter will torpedo you forward when activated, letting you spear through enemies and power-ups (I guess they can be called that). Now, I know I called this some sort of racer, and I'm sticking with it, but it's not in the traditional sense. Every mission has different objectives and finishing it with 3 stars will unlock Trophy mode and Remix mode. Trophy mode is a even harder version of the same mission and that's where you'll be able to get your achievements. Some are possible, others are just impossible to get. But it's always fun, because the missions are short and usually can be completed within a few minutes.A fun experience, but the price is way too steep. Wait for a sale, then grab it.[Rating: 81/100]			",1657,631,69,221,194,16,225

												""It's like psychedelic shaders - the game. I watched nothing but colours for five straight minutes and somehow it was the most rewarding ending a game has ever offered.""I got Dyad some time after I first saw it being played by its developer, Shawn McGrath, on a Twitch stream. It looked incredible. Like, I wasn't sure what to think. I just wanted to have a go. After eventually buying and playing the game for myself, I'm still not sure what to think. It's probably better if you just don't think, plug your senses into the game and feel it. Feel the game. Feel the game playing you as you play the game.Dyad is kind of post-genre but definitely arcade in nature. Imagine playing Tempest but with the pace of Burnout. That's kind of how it feels to play. The actual gameplay is essentially pair matching similar to the match-three style gameplay of Audiosurf. You need to be able to think quickly while remaining relaxed. Otherwise you'll never be able to figure out what you're doing, never mind wou're supposed to be doing. Also like Audiosurf (or any other rhythm game), Dyad lends itself well to short bursts of play as well as long sessions of score chasing on a single level.As confusing as it looks, (and it always looks confusing, even if you've played it,) it's a remarkably simple game. The concepts are fed to you at a satisfying pace, increasing the difficulty of the game as you progress through each level. To start with, you just have to ""hook"" two consecutive ""enemies"" of the same colour as many times as is required to complete the level while also avoiding the enemies themselves. However, as you encounter different types of enemies and you learn to use your second ability, ""lance"", things get difficult quickly as the complexity layers on and you start moving ever quicker through the infinite tube the game takes place within.If you like fast-paced, twitch gameplay, rhythm game-like mechanics, and are willing to be blinded for a few seconds for going on a lucky streak, you'll probably enjoy a quick session of Dyad or perhaps a long one if you're feeling competitive.

Controls feel very imprecise for the task at hand. Caused motion sickness for me. Crappy console port with bad menues. Had to unplug other USB devices to be able to use my Xbox controller.I don't remember how I got this, must have been part of yet another shovelware bundle. Wouldn't recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you enjoy bright lights and trippy tunes (especially on a good trip), and a good challenge while at it, try it out. I'd recommend waiting for a sale, however. The price is a tad high for the content as it stands.Nonetheless,I rate it a Woah... out of WOW! due to all the pretty lights and nifty tunes. It's like a brain massage.			",507,102,23,37,48,4,78

												Dyad strives on chaos. Without the visual flare that makes this game so special, it's just another tunnel runner. But don't let that stop you from picking this up; it may not feel as exciting as you expect, but it sure is a hell lot of fun. Just know what you're getting into before laying down cash on this one. 8.2/10.			",141,51,5,18,17,1,17

												I first played Dyad at Indiecade a couple years ago, and although I thought it looked pretty, it seemed way too easy. Well, I must've either been high at the time, or else they made it a lot more challenging, because the next time I played it, on my own PC, it was much more difficult. Aside from a few minor game design disagreements, I don't have any complaints. Each level has two basic formats: The first is to familiarize yourself with the new mechanic it introduces and get a score out of 3 stars. The second is a trophy level where you have to achieve some adrenaline-releasing task that requires expertise of the aforementioned mechanic. The latter format would take me anywhere between a minute and several hours depending on the level.If you're into demoscene-style visuals, the ending is probably a nice treat for you too. I enjoyed it thoroughly, even without the employment of psychedelics.			",627,240,10,61,32,2,64

Don't be fooled by the light-hearted trailer, this game is pretty repetative. I'm glad I bought it during the sale, because it certainly is not worth the $15 it demands. Although I only played for less than a full hour so far, this game is exteremely boring, and the repetativeness and variationless expreience provided by the trailer is exteremely misleading, especially in the first few levels. The music is horrible and subtracts from what seemed like a good experience.Plus, the controls are crap. Imprecise, along with vague tutorials and faulty guidance system makes for a horrible game.This game is so bad IGN gave it a 10.			",83,10,0,4,10,0,9

												I can't recommend it because it is really buggy. I spent my money to play this and now it crashes as soon as I try to play a level with no explanation. Computer is sound, it shouldn't be an issue. Others have encountered the same issue, or a similar issue with no response from the Dev. It hasn't been updated in over a year either, so I would guess it just isn't going to be. Don't spend a lot of money until it is updated. From the response of others, I would say the gameplay is fun. But that's only if you are lucky enough to get there. I recommend reading the discussion pages before a purchase t see if you want to take the chance.EDIT Update: Speaking to the developer he said this error occurs on some sets of nVidia cards. He gave no indication he had any intention to fix this.			",331,185,8,74,50,3,58

You appear to need an xbox controller to even play it and even then the controls are imprecise and the actual gameplay is simple and not that psychedelic (it seems the between level bits are more psychedelic than the game itself). The game is very simplistic - like tetris with only one shape. Do yourslef a favor if you want a psychedelic game go buy Space Giraffe (or any other Llamasoft game really)			",56,11,0,5,8,0,10

Thats it.There is no other action. I was really expecting more. There might be some gamers who like this, but for me it was too boring.

												It...Hang on.Dyad...Right. OK. Dyad is a game that is hard to describe. Many of the other reviews describe the effect like being on drugs, and I agree. It feels amazing and responsive when you pull off a level perfectly, and while the difficulty ramps up rather quickly I never felt as if I was out of control. This is definitely a point in its favour, because the graphics are... trippy, to say the least. Imagine the Doctor Who opening without the Tardis or the music, then synch up some weird electronic beat and underlying melody,add in weird beeps and boops when you hook an enemy and that is pretty much the experience of Dyad.Plus you have taken all the drugs.

All there is is exactly as the game looks in the screenshots. Here's a description:You're a... Thing. And you travel through these tubular things, and have to collect things while avoiding things. That's... about all it is. Level after boring psychadelic level, there's just nothing new. They introduce a new ""Enemy"" about halfway through the game, but several levels afterwards you'll just get stuck like me. The levels become rediculously impossible (only halfway through the game) and there aren't that many levels in the game, but I'd be amazed if you could even get THAT far because it's SO BORING.

												My eyes are bleeding and my brain hurts.  Trip your way through some psychedelic♥♥♥♥♥♥and get some high scores.  It's arcade style fast paced action.  It's audiosurf with actually fun game mechanics, except you make your own music in this one.			",457,123,29,57,63,8,94

												Despite its interesting premise, it actually gets pretty repetitive and potentially boring.  Levels are long and have a uniform structure to them, so you're pretty much doing the same thing over and over until time runs out, and then possibly a couple more times if there are multiple stages of a level.  Precision was also difficult due to the abstractly moving targeting reticle.  The music can sometimes be catchy, but it just didn't make up for how bored I was getting, not to mention feeling sick from the blurring visuals.  There's a lot of content here, but without a plot to justify the tedium, I don't want to play it.			",137,47,3,21,14,4,26

												I was only able to cope with this game for about 45 minutes before having to come here and tell you to please buy it.If you grab it on sale then all the better! I got my copy for $1.49! But even at full price this game has a lot to offer. Just be prepared to have your reflexes and eyes strained a little bit. I love the music. I adore the visuals. I'm in love with the gameplay.

												It's Audiosurf meets Space Giraffe. If you've played neither of those games, It's the astroids tube racer from Earthworm Jim but with psychadelics and everything seems to lock in with the rhythm. If you haven't played that, It's like riding a bobslet with rocket boosters on drugs.			",222,42,3,19,22,3,43

												Needs MAJOR BUG FIXING. It crashes so much, oftentimes right on the start screen. I am not the only one who experiences this problem, and until it is fixed, i do not recommend this game. I managed to play level one before it crashed one time, and I can confirm that it is a VERY pretty game, BUT IT IS UNPLAYABLE AT THIS MOMENT.			",91,20,0,12,6,1,6
