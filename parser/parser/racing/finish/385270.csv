Yes Its fun for a couple of minutes, but then you realize that actually you can't steer the car correctly, because even a turn makes you fly into the air. After 15 minutes I was able to buy every single upgrade from the shop. There is additional content when you buy through paypal, but who wants to do that? Multiplayer is empty and everything is in development, when I say everything there is only one map available at this moment which have air loop and few obstacles, that's it.

								Jet Racing Extreme is a racing game where you get behind the wheel of a jet powered car and race around one of (currently) four tracks. There's not much else to say about the game itself so I'll crack on with the rest of my review.+A fair amount of customisation is available for your car, you can change the paint colour which is pretty basic but you can also upgrade the components of your car as well as fine tune them to create the best vehicle possible+The car's damage models are good and the car breaks apart nicely upon impacts, smashing into things is a big part of the game so this is rather important+Decent sound effects, the car noises are reasonably realistic in particular-Keyboard controls are, as expected of a racing game, bad and despite the dev claiming the game is best played with a gamepad the gamepad controls are quite possibly worse with terribly thought out bindings and no way to change the bindings for the gamepad (keyboard bindings can be changed)-There are currently only four maps available, two of which are just a short section of one of the other maps-The camera occasionally swaps angle randomly and most of the camera angles in the game are completely useless for a fast paced racing game - Seemingly this has now been fixed-The driving and general physics aren't even slightly realistic despite the claims on the store page and in the forums-None of the UI is explained at all making it almost completely pointless-The point system doesn't really work properly, I sometimes got given stunt points for crashing into objects and spinning uncontrollably which doesn't really make sense-A few grammatical and spelling errors, obviously not everyone speaks perfect English but it can't be too hard to get someone to proof-read-Despite not being a mobile port (the devs are planning to port it to mobile however) it does very much feel like a game that belongs on a smartphone or tablet rather than a PC or laptop-The mouse cursor always stays visible, one of my major pet peeves in games-You can't reverse so if you crash into a wall and can't turn out of it you're forced to restart-You can't pause the game! Another of my major pet peeves, seriously it's 2015 and we can't pause our games?-As you can see from the below comment section, the dev really has no idea how to communicate with the Steam community, telling me, among other things, that I'm wrong because I disagree with himVerdict:Avoid it like the Plague (2/10)Jet Racing Extreme is a poor mobile port that fails at what it sets out to achieve, with poor controls, sub-par graphics and a fair few other issues this game is neither worth your time nor money.No drama, Just Reviews.El K.

''I destroyed my car and my keyboard too!''I got this one for free, so I shouldn't complain. However, I will.Jet Racing Extreme is a Trackmania-like game. High speed (not as high as TM tho :( ), tricky physics, loops and obstacles ahead the track and a lot, A LOT of stuff that can induce rage (rage ranging from verbal rants to literally destroying your keyboard with your teeth and then pluging your cat's tail on the usb port to use as keyboard replacement).  At first it looks nice, unity 3D engine well used, decent graphics good modeling (just good) nice textures but It is still in  early access stage, so its not flawless. The lack of car options is a feature that should be fixed asap, though the (still small) possibility of customization fills that hole a little. Same goes for the available race tracks. Sound-wise its not bad, though again it turns to be repetitive and there are no sound options available as for the time of this review is being written (I'd recomend devs, for (._.)'s sake add this urgently!) I always loved to construct stuff, but i like destruction with the same passion, and JRE has it! You can destroy your vehicle in a billion pieces (probably less, but well, sounds more destructive). This is probably the strongest point of the game, and the one that will make me recomend this game.In conclusion: If you are a fan of destruction, then get this game, specially if it is on sale. Note that the destruction of the in game vehicle added to the crazy physics can transfer to PC peripherals, room or car destruction due to rage effects. So, if you can't afford to lose stuff stay away of this and download Trackmania instead.(._.)'s score: 45/100 - ''I enjoyed it for a little while, then i cried myself to sleep''.

								Ok, good thing first. This is basically ""get from point A to point B in car that can go over speed of sound.""Driving feels crazy, in good way. Graphics looks nice, damage model is great, although in speed you are going to ride in, car basically explodes on every hit.Now problems. - This is mobile port, in worst possible meaning of that. - Some stuff is controllable only by clicking on virtual buttons. - Controls are COMPLETELY broken. Like, brake and nitro is mapped on same key and slightest hit on arrow sends you car spinning around. - ... and don't even think about controller. Not working. - Camera changes mode automatically, in worst possible moments, to worst possible angle. You WILL die because of this, every ***ing time.And worst of all, if you try to speak about this in forum, dev simply deletes thread.Do NOT buy.			",425,153,9,51,53,3,76

								It's really fun to crash your car, either bit by bit or in a huge explosion. As a car-crashing-simulator this game would get 8/10 from me.However, as a racing sim, this game plays terrible. There are quite a few obstacles on the road that will trash your car on the slightest contact and even without obstacles it is hard to keep the vehicle on the road. You will most likely spend more time flying than actually driving.+ destroying your car is fun+ flying your car across the track is fun- driving ""seriously"" is almost impossible- no background music- bad controls (not just vehicle controls, the whole UI suffers from bad design choices)- no online players			",949,303,39,123,72,11,145

								Right now this seems like a Rocket Car sandbox game rather than an actual race game but for the current sale price of $2.49 it's a pretty fun game. Once you've figured how to map the controls to your joypad (I recommend mapping ""Steering"" to the left stick, ""ThrottleBrake"" to the right trigger, ""Airbrake"" the the left trigger and ""SteeringDirect"" to the right stick ... then don't use the right stick at all), the car is pretty fun to drive and the physics result in some fun stunts and crashes. The graphics are pretty nice and the game runs pretty smoothly for an Early Access title.Overall it's a fun driving game for two fitty, buy it while it's on sale.			",1879,710,92,183,194,22,269

								Ok this game has so much potential to be really cool but my god it needs a lot of fixing! It seriously has some of the fastest racing I've ever experienced and the crashes are freaking spectacular! The controls however are janky as hell. Keyboard works moderately well but when you try to use a 360 controller its super sensitive and does not control well at all. You can theoretically tweak the car's controls through an option menu in game but this didn't make any difference with the controller and it apparently made the keyboard steering stop working even after I put it back to the default values.So as it stands right now, its fun but frustrating. Though there's still alot of amusement watching yourself crash and burn over and over it does get tiresome when you want to attempt to actually complete a lap. My friend managed it, but I didn't.In another 6 months I think this game will be fantastic and as such, I say jump on the bandwagon early because these developers deserve your money to be able to realize their vision! Just lower your expectations with the current build (Jan. 15th, 2016) and know that its currently a CCC title rather than a AAA. I'm sure it'll improve with a little developer love and community support!			",222,53,12,25,8,3,18

								Very fun game, but also very difficult. I find games like this a lot of fun, but this is the best of this type of game that I have found. They managed to make it extremely fun, but also realistic, so going 400 MPH and crashing into a wall actually obliterates your car. Pros: -Extremely fast, and dangerous driving-very good destruction physics-Realistic, but also fun (unlike some games that are too simulater-ish)-a few good but challenging tracks-more tracks to come when out of early access-actual shop where you can buy parts for your car-you can change the look and color of your carCons:-steering can be very wonky, but when you hook a controller up, it's is slightly easier-going too fast will throw you off the track when going around a bend-not many players online (would be better if more people played)-when you crash your car completely, it brings up a sign, sometimes deducting you 100 pointsAt it's current state, the game is well worth the money as you are getting a good amount of content, but the game could be improved on quite a bit (Fix that steering!) hopefully AI will be added in future updates as it would make the game more interesting. The game is cheap, so if your looking for some fun and you don't want to spend too much, buy this now.			",98,5,0,5,6,0,1

								The concept is good, but the game is very very poorly made. The idea of driving a jet-powered car at 700km/h while using stuff like turbo jets for extra speed is cool. The HUD is also kinda cool, but the actual gameplay is honestly terrible. I'm not bad at racing games at all, but it took me about 15 minutes to get to the first checkpoint on a random track I picked. The controls are absolutely terrible and when going over 200 km/h (which feels like 50cc mariokart speed) the car won't turn properly anymore. Overall this game plays terribly and I will not recommend it at all. The concept is fun, execution is poor.Idea 9/10Graphics 6.5/10Controls 0/10Gameplay 0/10			",37,8,1,5,3,1,0

								I tried this game today by chance and I find it really interesting. Imagine this....you are in control of the fastest purpose-built vehicle that man has ever seen, Your mission is simple , race to the finish line and care not to crash . :D It sounds dull but it is amazing. Very nice physics , damage system and interesting simulation. You will need time to familiarize your self with the controls and more time to tame that ""Beast with a fragile heart"" , but once you grasp the basics you are going to have lots of fun. Keep in mind that this game is under development and it is going to get better , i hope they add more vehicles but without overdoing it and imporove customization and parts you can have . I don't mean that I want ""Rocket League"" physics just more parts to play with and have fun. Enjoy.			",56,8,8,1,7,1,8

Refreshingly Addictive!The game is in early access with few tracks but each time i play, i feel i have more to explore! I was surpised to see such detailed physics made with unity engine! Down to each and every part of the vehicle! The crashes are mind blowing, you never know what shape you will be after! Tracks are super challenging: At one point you think ""WTF THATS IMPOSSIBLE!"" but again you are tempted to try, with an awesome soundtrack \m/ to keep you engaged!Learning more about the vehicle makes you a better driver, as there are interesting configurations to experiment with and tame that beast! To add to all this awesomeness, you can equip a gun to destroy bots that kamikaze on you! Hopefully, this shows a promise of vehicular combat action in the future! With the developers now shifting to Unreal Engine, the game will, without a doubt, make a huge leap towards awesome  graphics and gameplay! There is immense potential with more tracks, vehicles, guns! I sincerely hope the multiplayer part is carefully developed as this is what will make the game truly complete!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Warning: What you are about to play is EXTREMLY difficult, but can be fun once you start learning the controls.If you love making big crashes, this is also for you. The game is fun in its own right just to have fun and mess around. Your car is going to be very twitchy, careful use of the booster and brake respectively will be the key in whether or not you survive your run. I still have yet to complete Overpass. Messing around can help you figure out the controls, but it will take a lot of time to master which may turn some people off from playing this one.I play a lot of high speed, futuristic games such as Wipeout, F-Zero, but never have encountered anything like this unique game.  It is a simulator, you may want to re-bind the default controls. From what i have experienced so far, i am enjoying it. It runs nicely, minus a few occasional frame skips. Probably my computer. I like the fact you can customize and mess with your vehicle, giving it an almost career like mode. The learning curve on this sim is quite high, even for experienced gamers. You may understand this better if you have played flight simulators which require careful presicion. I plan on playing it a lot more overtime and practicing. An in game tutorial race might be helpful for new players, rather then just a text/picture manual. The game is nicely detailed, i have to say its worth the $3. This is not for people who don't want to take the time to carefully learn a game. Patience is a must.			",101,87,17,28,3,0,6

								I think this game is a work in progress and it deserves more + votes. the controls are a little strange at first but so was trying to fly in Battlefield 4. great graphics provided at top speed max settings with no FPS loss. This is one of those Games I could spend hours playing not even caring what I'm doing just driving around crashing into walls losing tires and parts pushing the limits of every corner on the racetrack to see what I can get away with. you drive your jet car around several race tracks (providing you make it past the first gate) at top speed (at least I do)to see how far you can get. I love it when you hit something and your car disintegrates or you tear off a tire and keep driving. I'm not sure about the point system and it don't bother me. this is a fun game and I recommend this game 10/10 I can't wait to see what this Dev does with this game in the future. the Game pad update came today so now you can use a controller and it sure is fun. I think if you can't make at least the top 5 on the leaderboards you shouldn't do a bad review. this game deserves a little more attention, a lot more than it's getting. it's in early access the game was released July 14th 2015 yeah there is going to be some bugs in it no game has ever Launched without one bug. the people that are giving this game a thumbs down have probably only played it less than 2 hours and haven't made it to the top 5 on the leaderbords. okay so there it is #1 top 50 leaderboards.

Early Access Review
								TLDR:Jet Racing Extreme is a simple, fast racing game with well-made damaging and destruction system. It is fun for a little bit but it is not anything special and is not worth its price. I feel like developers wanted to make a good arcade game but then mixed it with realistic damage and destruction system and it didn't match well.Details:+ Fast-paced gameplay with nice (but somehow weird) steering. The speed one can reach here is really high and it is exciting;+ Destruction and damage system - it is very good, detailed thing in this game. You can damage your wheels and even get them completely destroyed and you would still be able to drive your car. That is an interesting and well-made idea;+ Maps are nice and interesting;+/- Car upgrades - There are many upgrades available to your vehicle parts which is nice. Although, I somehow had enough money to upgrade everything to its max level after my very first race and I did not even know why. That completely ruined the upgrade system for me. Hopefully they will change it someday in the future;- Sometimes you could get a feeling that the game is actually too fast - it is very nice to feel the speed but your vehicle always crash after touching literally anything. That is frustrating and I would rather like to enjoy the speed rather than seeing my car crashing so often in such an arcade game;- I feel like developer mistakenly mixed 2 different, opposite things in this game - they created realistic game if it comes to damage, destructions and physics but I did not like that - I feel like this game should be a very fast-paced arcade racer in which you could get unbelievable, enormous speeds and enjoy the fast ride without worrying about your car getting crashed that much. Unfortunately, that is impossible - your car gets destroyed everytime it touches something and it frustrates a lot - it completely removes the ""arcade"" thing;- Music is repetetive and boring. So are sound effects - honestly they were making me annoyed and I could not stand them after a while;- In-game purchases - the game itself is a port from mobile game but I try not to judge it by that. However, seeing in-game purchases or ""Premium"" versions etc. is not good. Only if the game was incredibly cheap but it is not - that is why I am surprised they even kept these in-game purchases in a PC version. That is a big NO;- Multiplayer seems to be dead. What is even worse, single player mode is boring - you do not even compete with any other AI-controlled cars. You just drive alone;- Graphics could be better;Summing up:I cannot recommend Jet Racing Extreme at its current state. It is not worth the price with what it offers at the moment. It has very good damage and destruction system and physics are nice. However, the thing how developer mixed arcade and realistic style is a big mistake in my opinion. I hope the game will be upgraded and more features will finally be added but as for now, I cannot recommend buying this game, especially for the full price.			",1126,344,56,114,112,16,161

								This game has potential. I still remember the predecessor called P.O.D. many years ago but here there is just a few things about. First of all the car is impossible to command (at least via keyboard). You press left or right and it turns like there was a corner. In any case there is no way to properly command the car. The turbo boost make you just fall from every road. Physic is a problem here because there is no collant between the car and the road. The play will be like this:  start -- fall out. restart -- fall out.  restart -- fall out. restart -- fall out. restart -- go around like a mini scooter speed vehicle... reach a checkpoint, start to push engine and .. fall out.Let's take a definitive decision: UNPLAYABLE.Lord's Hol Napult experience: 3/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is pretty much TrackMania, but simulating the physics affecting your car. All the awesome speed and stunts you see in other racing games are pretty much deadly here, since the car feels and reacts like a real car would.Reaching the end of a track is a real challenge, and crashing your car, tearing it into pieces somehow never gets old.The controls are solid, there is some sort of driving assist that keeps you on track sometimes, but it's still very easy to completely lose control of the car if you don't brake in time.There's not that many tracks yet, but the game's still in early access.Right now, you pretty much get what you see in the trailer. If you find it interesting, you should give it a try.			",371,83,5,15,9,1,19

								positive- great, detailed model jet engine car- very detailed and realistic destruction model of carnegative- everything else :)- tracks and environment look awful compared to good looking vehicle, like it was done at least 10 years agoTo me it feel more like interesting concept that is forced to be "" full game"", physics is interesting but it is "" designed"" to be very hard and unplayable. And there is this thing, you have super advanced, ultra fast ""car"" on specially prepared tracks so you can test it, but is is very easy to crush and destroy your vehicle, restart and try again countless of times, this would be ok, even if controls are working against you it is still your mistakes that gets you wrecked. But why there are giant rocks in the middle of the road, blockades and barricades? In specially prepared track for driving? Deaths and crush count was to low? This game have very little content but due it's ""designed"" hard controls if might feel like there is more than it actually is because you will restart and restart and restart little more. After a while you will feel like you are wasting you time laying this like I did, not recommenced.			",730,332,28,78,68,8,111

								Looked cool at first but then I played it...Pros:None reallyCons:- There are no Volume controls at this time, you have to turn your system volume down- The controls are hard to master- Steering is not good at all- Crazy and unrealistic physics that are hard to understand Overall: The game has a cool idea but it wasent executed well, I will re look at it once it has some updates ",28,2,0,4,7,0,0

								- There are better ways to emphasise speed than making the car impossible to control- This game seems to exist in an alternate universe where friction doesn't exist- dodging around small obstacles in the track might be fun if the car were actually capable of making precise movements- No, that wall of text I had to wait for when launching the game telling me 'the game isn't bad, you're just bad' didn't help			",112,21,3,17,19,2,17

Early Access Review
								It can be fun, I guess. But so far the controller settings are wonky and buggy. Which made it wonky for me to play the game, which probably helped the physics feeling very very wonky.I'm not too sure I like the devs posts on the forums saying things like ""Controller support works for some people and that's good enough"" or ""This is a hardcore game get used to [the bad controller support] or gtfo"" (I'm paraphrasing not quoting ipsis literis).So far I'm neither impressed nor hopeful. But still I hope I can change this review in the future.Edit: After some 2 hours fiddling with the controls and whatnot I've at least found a way to play with the keyboard. I hope I hadn't. The driving is just horrible. The behaviour of the car was horrendous and it kept steering by itself into obstacles. It took me a while to find out that the autopilot (?) was turning itself on at speed. You can turn it off but then: a) The car is uncontrollable; b) the a/p stays off for a little bit and then comes back on.And so far I haven't understood why it's called ""racing"", and on the menu you click on ""race"", yet all the scores are kept in stunt points... I don't even know the time in which I completed the circuit.I got this game for free and so far I hope I hadn't. I would gladly gift it to someone else if I could but I wouldn't gift it to a friend...tl;dr: The premise is amazing and I love the idea, but the execution is not good. The controls are horrible and the mechanics are lacking.			",79,16,17,1,13,3,15

								I can't recommend this game in it's current state.Some general observations leading me to this conclusion:The 'Single Race' mode can't really be called a race in any sense of the word... unless you redefine the word race to mean a single car is driving on the track.Multiplayer is completely empty.'Car Tuning' is a nice idea, but the numbers are kind of useless. For example, do you know what either '15000 Spring' or '300 Damper' are supposed to mean? Me either. Neither is it intuitively clear what impact bringing these numbers up or down actually do short of trial and error.The 'Paint Lab' is also sort of neat, but only being able to pick a single color for the body makes it feel kind of limited.While I can figure out what the upgrades in the 'Parts Shop' are for, the insistence from the developers that there ""is no in-app payments in Steam version of the game"" is easily refuted by seeing that there is indeed a section in the parts shop which gives the user an option to buy barrels (in game currency unit) and upgrade packs for real money via PayPal.Most importantly, however, the gameplay is just not very good. While you get the sense that you're able to travel quite fast in the vehicle (and this can be quite fun for a moment), the steering and obstacles are kind of ridiculous. Any minuscule bump of an object sends the vehicle into a wild tailspin resulting in anything from the vehicle falling apart until it can no longer be driven to outright explosions. I could forgive the flaws above if the game played well, but this simply isn't the case. As funny as it can be to cause crashes and watch the vehicle fall apart after giving up on trying to 'race' properly, the novelty wears off really quickly. Even the videos promoting the game all end with some ludicrous crash sequence, tellingly enough.If the issues above (or at least the gameplay) are fixed, this has the potential to be a good game. However, given that the Early Access description describes the game as 'Technically Complete' I won't be holding my breath.Note: Game was provided to me for free via orlygift.com ",618,226,12,86,74,6,118

								A little racing game with practically no replay value. Graphics are comparatively average, the gameplay is simple, but the steering is a bit... strange, I'd say. Destruction system and upgrades add more fun into the game but upgrades are somewhat easy to unlock, and when it's done, repetitive music starts really bugging your ears. No AI opponents in the racing game is not good either.Then again, Early Access. And it's kinda fun.			",464,104,18,51,30,3,58

								I really wanted to give it a proper playtime, but I simply couldn't do that. :(What annoyed me in the first place is no controller support at all. I could try and try to smash the joypad buttons but it simply didn't work.Second thing - the graphics.I wanted to blame it all on my old laptop, that I don't like this game, but I won't do that.The time of the game reaction after I press any button is just horrible. I lowered the graphic details to the minimum, knowing that my laptop is not the youngest one, and the mouse cursor was acting normally, but when I was driving and trying to take a nice turn...I've suddenly found myself flying off the course for no reason. O_o And even after I've stopped touching any buttons...the vehicle just continued to...fly? slide? drive? whatever?!In my humble opinion: there are many more decent racing games more or less graphically complicated then this one and they give you hours of pleasure and work great. :)Sorry Jet Racing Extreme, but I am giving you a thumb down. Maybe I will reconsider playing you in the future and change my mind, but until then... :(			",1689,788,52,207,163,18,228

								Game had potential - unfortunately, driving itself is very hard... not, because driving is sensitive, not because driving is too slow... it just feels shaky. I tried around 10 times to drive normally, but I failed. I kept being out of the track, having some air-flights...Tutorial is basically wall of text. I really dislike such stuff, it's tedious to read and I usually don't bother to read them, because I want feel game first - then adapt my knowledge to new features - boosters, breakers, etc.So yeah, another developer who expects people to read massive text. I read it, but still I felt like i have no idea what to do. If I wanted to read, I would go play Visual Novel!Currently, I don't think that game is worth it, but I will give it a try in a future.PS: Totally bad music in my opinion. I don't know exact genre, but sounds of gitars are too heavy and doesn't fit into game, in my opinion.			",445,151,17,46,41,7,47

								This game's store page video shows a lot of footage of cars being destroyed.  Sadly that's about all this game has to offer.  Controls are pretty bad (if not downright awful), and properly controlling your jet car is nearly impossible.  This game needs a complete adjustment of the control scheme in order to be remotely worth playing, and even then I'd still not recommend it.  Multiplayer is nonexistant, and you still have the problem of your car exploding when you inadvertantly hit a bump in the road (or crash head-on into a wall because of the awful controls).  The game boasts super realistic physics, but that may actually be the biggest flaw this game has to offer.Also, iOS/Android control is a lie.  An android app exists, but the iOS app was never approved by Apple.			",262,95,7,15,27,2,18

								Literally Unplayable, cant make progress or even finish a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ track.You crash every 15 seconds (not the game, the car), no multiplayer (empty af), straight up painful sound design, 12 year old level design, confusing costumization system and much much more this game does wrong.Just as everyone else says, the concept looks cool enough, but the actual gameplay absolutely ruins this expirience.

Early Access Review
								-Keyboard controls are, as expected of a racing game, bad and despite the dev claiming the game is best played with a gamepad the gamepad controls are quite possibly worse with terribly thought out bindings and no way to change the bindings for the gamepad (keyboard bindings can be changed)-There are currently only four maps available, two of which are just a short section of one of the other maps-The camera occasionally swaps angle randomly and most of the camera angles in the game are completely useless for a fast paced racing game - Seemingly this has now been fixed-The driving and general physics aren't even slightly realistic despite the claims on the store page and in the forums-None of the UI is explained at all making it almost completely pointless-The point system doesn't really work properly, I sometimes got given stunt points for crashing into objects and spinning uncontrollably which doesn't really make sense-A few grammatical and spelling errors, obviously not everyone speaks perfect English but it can't be too hard to get someone to proof-read-Despite not being a mobile port (the devs are planning to port it to mobile however) it does very much feel like a game that belongs on a smartphone or tablet rather than a PC or laptop-The mouse cursor always stays visible, one of my major pet peeves in games-You can't reverse so if you crash into a wall and can't turn out of it you're forced to restart-You can't pause the game! Another of my major pet peeves, seriously it's 2015 and we can't pause our games?-As you can see from the below comment section, the dev really has no idea how to communicate with the Steam community, telling me, among other things, that I'm wrong because I disagree with him			",92,14,0,9,6,2,6

I softly recommend this game, under the asterisk that the game is hard for most players and requires patience, making the game more homework than a relaxing vroom vroom session.

Early Access Review
								I received this game for free and was actually pretty excited to play it, but was phenomenally disappointed.As I was playing this game, I noticed that the vehicles were next to impossible to control and would fly off the track if you went at even the slightest of turns (you know those bottle rockets you would make as a kid out of old soda bottles that would jet off wildly into the air? It felt like trying to pilot one of those). I thought it might just be an isolated problem that just I was having because I didn't have any upgrades, but as I would upgrade my jet I noticed that it still was completely uncontrollable. I then looked to the Internet to see that it wasn't just my problem, it seems that just how the game was designed. Absolutely horrendous and makes the game near impossible to play.If having a driving/racing game where you CAN'T EVEN STEER THE VEHICLE wasn't a deal breaker enough:The maps are very poor, bland and look nearly identical to one another. Notice how all of the in-game screen shots are in the desert. You know why? Because seemingly all of the maps take place in the desert. Which map do you choose: racetrack in the desert 1, racetrack in the desert 2, or racetrack in the desert 3 (this time with a jump)? Boring. The developers put in basic turns and things combined with the occasional jump/bridge and such in a failed attempt to make the tracks interesting, but it doesn't matter because actually trying to use these things will make you crash.Combine all of that with a horrible soundtrack, bad controls, bizarre interface, near-nonexistent jet customization, mediocre at best graphics and the fact that the developer has seemingly abandoned this project in its Early Access phase and you get a very lackluster experience. I would not recommend that you pick this title up, even on sale. Take it at face value: not even the developer really even seems to care about it. That's saying something.			",26,20,0,2,1,0,3

Early Access Review
								Currently, this game is just about playable. The physics on the car are pretty cool and I appreciate how the destruction feels when you crash, that all works really well. There’s some really strange steering assist but it only seems to kick in at a certain speed, or something? My point is, I don’t understand it. But that’s fine; it works well enough because of how difficult the car is to control, and it should be. But why is there steering assist that’s so strong that it won’t let you leave the road? I really want to explore the levels this game has to offer but it fights me to stay on the track. These are all small complaints for a game that’s in early access. Things can easily change in the future and I like the concept so I’m glad I bought the game as it is because I like to see games grow. But my biggest complaint is how the makers of this game can have the nerve to include micro-transactions on an unfinished game. Not only that but these “micro”-transactions cost more than the game costs. As is, the game is worth £5 at the most. I’m glad it only cost me £1.99. I’m happy with that price.This game is promising if you ignore the micro-transactions. The gameplay is on the way to being really fun. I just hope that the developer sees that this kind of game would lend itself to a free-roaming style of gameplay, but I’m not the one making the game, that’s their choice.			",112,24,9,8,13,0,8

								I have very mixed feelings about the game.Crashing your car is fun as hell. The physics are awesome, and seeing all the pieces fly in a spectacular mess is great. The high speeds you reach feel cool, and when you barely dodge obstacles, you feel like a badass.Problem is, that's incredibly hard to do. The game doesn't control that great. Everything feels sluggish, and unresponsive. I can make it through a course, as long as I slow down dramatically at certain points. This isn't just me sucking at the game. Your car is made to be sensitive to crashing into objects, however, that should only apply when you're going at incredibly high speeds. I shouldn't break apart if I lightly touch something, while inching my car forward.Overall, it would be a really fun racing game if the controls were polished, and more content was added. It's got some cool physics going for it, but you can't enjoy that for long due to the game being too frustrating to play. If a lot of the problems are mended, then this could be quite fun!

								I'm not into racing games but even i can tell that this game is a horrible racing one!I don't understand how crashing all the time can be fun for some people ... (the fact is most of people who wrote a review, did it just to get point on some site to get free games)- The controlling is so horrible, i couldn't stay on the road for more than 2-3 minutes, no matter what i did- I spent most of my time flying & crashing ..- The driver doesn't move/do anything, he  just sit there & wait for his death, this is sooo annoying -.-- The smallest things can blow up your car, ""my car got destroyed once after i touched a small herb, oh  yeah a ♥♥♥♥ing herb (grass!!), nice job devs!""- As soon as you start the game,  you get a huge amount of point to unlock everything, without spending any efforts or time .. which raises many questions about the reason why they made those unlockable in the first place!!- As i can see from other reviews, the average time this game can provide is 15-30 mins max!- Again, game controlling & the game-play are so buggy/♥♥♥♥♥♥ (the main reason why i hated this game, it makes it almost unplayable).Overall, i can't recommend this game at all, just stay away of this! it's a waste of money & time. 3/10 would crash again!

								The game is great and constantly getting better.  It is an amazing experience once you get the hang of the controls.  Improving feels rewarding.  There is a learning curve and it takes a bit of patience(be prepared to crash and have your car ruined repeatedly).  I highly recommend it though for the unique take on racing with loops, corckscrews, jumps and everything else.  Multiplayer needs more users, but I expect it to take off.  Grab it while it's cheap as they plan to raise the price as they add features.			",89,21,1,17,3,1,2

Ive just got it yesterday, still liking it.  I think this game will grow potential and really be awesome.  Great indie game!   Jet controls are a bit hard to control, but managable for me.  My verdict is, this game is highly recommended from me 10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game has good potential so I will give it a thumbs up!It reminds me of Track Mania a bit with a jet-craft and more difficult. Currently, despite some adjustments its very difficult to just turn how you want, can't brake much and any contact will likely destroy your vehicle!  I have a very hard time trying to finish a track, maybe a bit too hard taking away the fun some. It definetly has some flaws but is in early development and has lots of potential and is a good price.			",314,64,48,19,11,3,23

								I think this game offers a nice set of fun but only for the people who love this kind of stuff. If you like Need for Speed u clearly won't like it unless u're into some serious crashing. This game will keep you entertained in short bursts thats sure. So overall I can recommend it for those who would like to see some anarchic crashing and flying machine part all over the map. It's still in development but I think even right now it's worth the price. Keep up the good work lads!			",259,31,27,25,18,2,37

								I got my copy of the game for free from orlygift.com, so I might be more lenient than I normally would. And to further expand my leniency, I priase the developers for their honesty on the steam game page mixing the standard meaningless marketing talk with straight honesty to not peak a customers interest that is looking for a different game.According to the developers this game belongs to the ""eXtreme simulation"" genre, whatever that is. After playing for a while it seems that such a simulation game is a game that is trying to be very accurate about that stuff us gamers rarely care about and mixing it high speed, explosions and destructions, things us gamer *do* generally care about.So what you'll end up with is a racing game with very high speeds making the car hard to control (just like in real life!). Mixing that in with inconvenient obstacles placed on the track by some narcissistic engineer to prove how awesome his speed machine is. In a way this game reminds me of the puzzle levels(where they called that?, idk) TrackMania in that the gameplay consists of you trying to get from checkpoint to checkpoint without exploding.As of writing the game consists of a single map on which several different tracks can be played. By playing the game you can earn an in-game currency with which you can by upgrades for you vehicle. All in all, this game is definitly not for everybody. But if you like challanging racing games, are hugely into jet engine power and aerodynamica this game might be for you.Though currently, with only a single map the game can get pretty boring pretty fast, making even the $5.00 that it is now pretty steep. Personally I would also like different cars that would handle completly different, just to make playing the same track more interesting.			",345,96,16,42,23,6,40

								For a ""racing simulation"" game, this game has no racing, or simulation, or any ounce of control whatsoever, the sole purpose of this thing is to crash your car as fast as possible and look at the results. And once more, another mobile delivered to steam, so you can pay money to beta test a game that is gonna be freemium on phone, infuriating.			",327,72,7,40,18,4,59

								I'll be honest. The reason why I haven't played as much as I should is because this game is just wayyyy too fast paced for me. I truly recommend this game to all racers looking for a challenge. It is well built and the physics are spot on. I only wish there was more than one vehicle, however they have designed and built that one perfectly. Definitely give it a shot.			",45,4,0,7,3,0,2

								I personally think this is a really cool idea. I love the destruction when you crash and getting up to high speeds and doing huge jumps and drifts and crashing is awesome. But the car itself is kinda hard to control at first. You get the hang of it as you play but its still really hard and i often have to have auto pilot on. I found it was easier with a controller but the controls are really weird. I really think there needs to be some effort put into controller mapping. I also think that maybe there should be speed classes for when theres eventually like a campain or something? So you dont over do it on some maps or maybe a difficulty setting. I look forward to seeing the updates for this game. Hopefully some new maps get put in. Maybe even a stunt map for lots of jumps and stuff. Maybe even some side game modes for fun like, Biggest jump, biggest crash, etc. I think the ios and Android gyro controlls are cool but hard to use. If you took advantage of controller gyros like in the PS4 controllers that would be cool as well. Also i love the music, but maybe try find some more? So its not the same everytime. Also maybe put a better explanation for the upgrades and stuff. Also maybe allow your only keyboard maping or at least a section with a list of controls for your game. I can not for the life of me find the parachute button. Anyway I like this game and im looking forward to when its finished.			",254,19,21,15,14,3,15

It is a little too early to call it a 'game', more a rocket car simulator I guess, graphics aren't bad, good hi-res textures etc.There's not a lot of point to it yet though, the races are nothing more than checkpoints and there's only one track and 'technically complete' is pretty much a lie.Worth it at £2 for a laugh, hope the devs do more with it though.

								OMG This game.The controls are sooooooo amazing if you like  to crash every 5 seconds.The graphics look wonderful if compare it to  super mario 1997.The online support is sublime, if you like  waiting 5 minutes for the game to load and being aloneI rate this game a 10/100 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I have a problem with the gameplay. The visuals, the sound, and anything in those areas are fine. I do not like the squirrely car system where I veer off into the abyss at a second. You guys really need to fix it and make it feel more like driving a car..and not a freaking paper airplane. You put a lot of work and time into this and I just feel like it needs to be my fault that I crash..not the fact that the game can't function even if I tweak it. Fix this issue and I'll gladly fix my review.			",44,9,0,16,11,2,7

								I love to drive up to a vertical cliff, then thrust with my jet engines up the mountain and into the sky for a huge jump that is unprecidented. With simpler courses, and multiplayer at high speeds up to mach one, this could have been a hit!  Unfortunately the vehicles are too powerful for the tight tracks they have built for them.  Awesome physics and damage is unprecidented for it's time.  A great game for fooling around on.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I got given the game for free and I wish I could go back in time and stop myself from using the key I got given, sadly that is not possible and I am stuck with this 'game' which has no online multiplayer servers for me at all and all I do is steer like a drunk moron who has never driven before in my life on some terrible maps in singleplayer. I'll admit that the game is fun for a couple of minutes, but you slowly get over the fact that your car is rolling and you have absolutely no control over what the car does. I don't think I could bring myself to play another 11 minutes of this game.			",135,33,3,12,17,3,7

								Initial ReviewThe game itself works fine. The reasons why i wont recommened this is because1. What the heck is Single player for? I was just testing around but ""The player"" has no sense of what he or she should do.  It was just go ride a jet fueled car in this crazy landscape2. Whats the difference between the different ""parts"" of a ""level""? I checked some and it basically just put me behind the next checkpoint. No difference really3. Instructions need to be part of the ""options"" menu. I was trying to find the keyboard controls but after you first tstart the game I cannot find it.4. Better remove the ""Mobile"" preferences. If this was for mobile we get it but before you relase it for PC better remove it(Early access I know, just saying)5. I think the controls are a bit too mobile oriented. I do not feel to be in control of the left and right turns in some parts of the mapsGot a free copy of the game from orlygift.com ",1187,472,41,92,96,10,144

								A good base, but in my opinion it's more a simulator than racing game in the present moment.What's good in this game:+ idea+ physics of the car and destructions+ tracks+ interface (menu)What needs to be done:- i don't like when a game starts from a configuration window with options. it reminds me old games- all of them should be in the game (resolution, key bindings)- lack of auto-discovering the controller- audio option in the menu doesn't work- the mouse is visible in the race- lack of pause in the race- more than one car- you can avoid the obstacles by going off the track (there's too much grip)- ABS should be turned on all the time. Without a controller it's uselessThe worst thing:- lack of idea for racing. In the singleplayer mode we don't have aims like: beat the track in 1:30m to grab the gold medal or beat the enemies or don't touch any obstacle. I couldn't play multiplayer because there was no players so singleplayer is more like a training. If it would be called ""Training"", I would understand, but singleplayer means that there are some AI's to beat, some story to tell or smth.I decided to give a thumb up because the idea of the game is now like: go ahead, drive on our tracks and have fun. The driving itself is fun, but it needs more to be done in the singleplayer to have fun in multiplayer.			",680,185,53,71,57,8,88

								This game is not my type of game, but I will not judge it around this as it has some potential, but could be improved quite a lot, but me disliking this type of game with still have a impact on recommending or not, the description, no.This game personally is quite hard to play, as the controls are either sensitive or annoying to use, and that they personally aren't the memorable. They have all the controls in mostly the right places, and it feels good when you play.The game itself could be improved by adding objectives, or it telling us what it should actually do, as there is no real objectives or point to this game that I can find then to ride around, crash into things, and gain points in and means possible.I'd pay nothing as it is not my type of game, but if I had to pick a price, it'd be around £0.99 - £2.00 to be fair on the developer who I'm sure has spent a ton of time creating and developing this game.Presentation - 6/10Graphics - 8/10Gameplay - 4/10Sound - 6/10Controls 2/10Quality - 8/10			",82,9,2,1,10,0,9

								Got a free copy of the game from orlygift.comWhile I did enjoy crashing in ridiculous ways and literally flying all over the tracks with every ramp I took, it got boring quite fast. The car really needs some better handling, since the only two ways of taking a corner seem to be ""not enough"" and ""full 180"". The shop needs some polishing too. They didn't remove the cash shop, but gave you enough money to buy everything there is to buy instead. This obviously caused quite some confusion. 6/10 For fancy looks, laughs and flying.

								I'd really like a ""only on a bundle"" button here, between yes and no. The game itself is not terrible, but I can really spend €5 on something i'll enjoy for a longer time.The game is fun, for the first few minutes. But then you realize you have very few options, other than playing the same few tracks (a total of 4 tracks right now, all in the same environment, and they look and feel very similar). There appear to be 8 tracks planned per map, and 4 different maps, so a grand total of 32 tracks, but I'm just reviewing the current state of the game, hopefully that means a lot more variety and fun.Driving is very hard, at times you will feel you have very little control on anything. Physics are weird too, on one side you have very good deformable car models, but on the other cars feel very ""squishy"". Slight impacts with objects can cause unproportionate amount of damage/deformation (i.e. taking a ramp slightly sideways to ""flip"" your car in the air can occasionally, and apparently randomly, simply make your car explode on contact).Racing is actually the minor part of the game. The actual challenge is to explode in a spectacular way!I'll give it a ""yes"" because I had fun, though it didn't last very long, but that might be mitigated in future by more tracks and stuff.

								My rating....its OK.Nothing too spectacular as far as the racing goes.  The crashes are the best part of the game.  The controls are too sensitive in my opinion and you do tend to oversteer which results in a lot of airtime (and said spectacular crashes if you were moving fast enough).  The shop is nothing to speak of and you will be able to get everything maxed out in 15 minutes of play...and frankly I didn't notice that much of a difference.  They REALLY need to update that to remove the cash references.  Also need more tracks but that looks like it is still coming along so it is early yet there.They have done a nice job on the crashes though with physics and graphics but it is likely you will play with it at hour or so and be done unless you just love racing (and crashing).Did I mention the crashing is nice?

								This game serves as a great example of why early access is bad. This game is not ready for the public...I'm not sure what I am suppose to be doing most times. I can steer the car correctly and I can't even get an inch down the track without flying and smashing into something. This game is amusing to say the least, but I wouldn't recommend it. Another reason is it kinda feels like this game was poorly ported from an android build....			",194,22,3,17,8,2,31

								Got a free copy of the game from orlygift.com.  It's pretty entertaining but the controls/auto steering take a bit to get used to.  Reminded me of the old Need For Speed game where you would drag race and pressing left or right just moved you over one lane.  I'd rather steer around turns myself.			",82,8,2,6,6,0,2

								This game is really challenging unless you have a very good balance point for landing as most of the landing from ramp make ur car damage. I would say that if your not good in neither at perception of landing or controlling ur speed of car, this is totally not suitable for you.			",508,206,10,62,47,7,68

								I find this game fun. But there are some serious problems that I hope they fix in the future.Here they are:-Audio Setting don't come up when clicked-Tried to use a controller but game wasn't letting me-Car VERY difficult to control-Checkpoints don't really work-Could fully upgrade car from beginning of the game-Can't reverse so if you get wedged between rocks (which you most definitely WILL) you have to restart-Punished for going too fast. One minute you're having a great time driving full speed then a rock comes out of no where and you explode-Car flips a lot and you have to restart because it's unlikely to flip itself back over-Super sensitive steering-Not much contentI enjoyed the game, and it can be a very promising title. If all or even most of these issues were corrected I would be willing to pick this title up again.			",138,28,1,23,29,0,16

Full Disclosure: I received the game from OrlyGift for the purpose of reviewing.It's difficult for me to recommend this game.  There's nothing significantly wrong with it, but the fact that it's a mobile game ported to PC lends some issues.  For example there's no way to change the screen width.  This was made worse by the fact that the controls in the beginning cover the entire screen.The microtransaction model probably isn't the best, either.  If the devs asked, I'd probably recommend setting the game's price at a couple bucks and just let it be.The game is sub-par, but the concept is good.  If it changes down the line, I'll re-review.
