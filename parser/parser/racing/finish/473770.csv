								my hands hurt.i mean, i'm not even particularly good - sure, i have some records with the barracuda but i'm not a zen-level enough pilot to pop it open normally. nevertheless i've spent hours chasing hundredths of a second on the leaderboards. i powered through each season of the campaign, learning just how i needed to dart around each corner to keep up. i've restarted a million times at the first imperfection, frustrated by my own inconsistency. and the process has not been kind to my hands.and it's all totally worth it.if you're at all a wipeout fan in any capacity - whether you're a middling player like me, a venom class pilot that likes to casually race, or a literal zen-level deity with a neGcon - install this game. it's still perhaps rough around the edges in some places, but don't let that or the early access tag keep you away. there's a ton of AG goodness in this package.the visuals (and the physics) hearken back to the days of the PS1 - the game looks like 2097/XL, feels like 3, and has a wealth of tools for for the intrepid modder. custom ships are already supported (with custom tracks forthcoming) if you know your way around a 3D model, and steam workshop support is, i believe, in the works.online play isn't in yet, but don't let that stop you either. the leaderboard competition is stiff as it is, so you can still show off your skill and sate your competitive appetite. and besides, it'll be great practice for when the online mode does release.best of all, the devs are wipeout-heads, so you can guarantee that the game will stay true to the spirit and even the aesthetic of the wipeout series.so grab a controller and come put your hands through the wringer. you'll be grateful you did.

								EN : Extremely faithful to the original PS1 Wipeout games, BNG is a game by the fans for the fans.Physics are well handled, the game feel is identical to the one you could have had when playing Wipeout XL/2097/Wip3out.Demanding, requiring learning various piloting techniques, the game offers a steep learning curve, yet allowing newcomers to get in. Taking the form of speed classes, you'll find a growing game speed, from slow to blinding fast. Just don't expect to master Zen Class in 10 minutes!Visuals will be the most dividing part. Here, the goal is to emulate the PS1 look, and various options are there to replicate visual glitches typical of the old console. To me, the game has a charming feel to it, as you can still feel the modern technology below the retro-appearance.Learning and perfecting your piloting will be the main driving force in the game, which, as an early access game does already have its fair share of content.AI races and tournaments, Time Trials (where competition for the top leaderboard spots is tight!), an incoming multiplayer (both online and splitscreen) all with 8 original ships, 5 bonus ships, and their dragship versions (insanely fast but very hard to steer) on around 15 tracks (more incomming too!)To conclude, BNG offers a very interesting feature. Customisation. You can import the orginal 3 Wipeout ships if you own the discs/ISOs. All of them, with corresponding stats! Steam Workshop is supported, and you could very well make your own ship, if you know how to model. Sounds effects and music are also customizable.The dev team is working hard on the game, they are very open to feedback of their players, which is quite nice. I do think BNG has a bright future!I recommend this game to all lovers of the original Wipeout series, all lovers of demanding yet rewarding gameplay and all lovers of the PS1 era.FR : Extrêmment fidèle aux WipEouts de l'ère Playstation 1, BNG est un jeu par les fans pour les fans.La physique est maîtrisé, le feeling manette en mains est identique à celui qu'on a pu avoir en jouant à Wipeout 2097/Wip3out.Exigeant, demandant une assimilation de techniques de pilotage variées,le jeu propose tout de même une courbe de progression adaptée à tout les niveaux. Présenté sous formes de classes, vous y trouverez une vitesse croissante, du plus lent au plus rapide. Ne vous attendez juste pas à piloter parfaitement en Classe Zen dès les 10 premières minutes!Les visuels sont l'aspect qui partagera probablement le plus. Le parti pris ici est d'émuler le look des jeux PS1, et diverses options permettent de simuler les défauts d'affichage de cette vieille console! Le jeu a, pour ma part, un charme fou, car on sent quand même la pointe de modernité, sous l'apparence retro.Apprendre et perfectionner son pilotage est le facteur le plus motivant du jeu, qui, fort de son statut d'early access, ne rougit pas devant la quantité de contenu déjà disponible.Des courses/tournoi contre l'IA, des contre-la-montre (ou la conquête des leaderboards est serrée!), un multijoueur en approche, le tout avec 8 vaisseaux originaux, 5 vaisseaux bonus, et les version dragship (super rapide et bien plus difficile a jouer) ainsi qu'une quinzaine de circuits. Pour finir, BNG propose une customisation très intéressante. Vous pouvez importer les vaisseaux originaux des 3 premiers Wipeout, si vous possedez les cd/isos. Les vaisseaux sont tous la! Et avec des stats correspondant aux originaux. Il propose également un support workshop, et donc il est tout a fait possible d'importer vos modèles, si vous savez les fabriquer. Enfin, les bruitages et la musique sont aussi interchangeable.Le jeu est suivi de très prêt par son équipe de développement, très ouverte à l'écoute et au feedback de ses joueurs, ce qui est fort appréciable. Il a des beaux jours devant lui!Je le recommande a tout amoureux de la saga originelle, tout amateur de gameplay exigeant mais très jouissif une fois maîtrisé, ou tout simplement, tout amateur de l'ère PS1.

								I wished somebody would make an anti-grav racing game like Wipeout 3, sadly I haven't seen anything even remotely close until now.Unfortunately I was looking for more of a successor, not a clone. The game mechanics are exactly the same as Wipeout 3. I mean exactly. The tracks feel a bit claustrophobic and rough. Also for some reason the graphics are on the absolute minimum settings out of the box. Once I realized this, I turned everything to max and it looks acceptable. Needs larger more free flowing tracks for Zen class IMO.Those gripes aside it is a solid Wipeout 3 clone. Works perfectly with my Xbox 360 controller. Beats loading up the emulator to play Wipeout 3. Heck I even imported the Wipeout 3 OST to really get the feels.Honestly it is hard not to recommend this game if you enjoyed Wipeout/XL/3 and have a compatible controller. It is free, moddable and fun!			",204,36,4,33,28,0,21

								You're gonna like this game if you're already a fan of Wipeout, or if you're unafraid of immense learning curves, losing doesn't bother you, and you're into low-reward high-effort skill-based racing games. If you don't hate yourself, you should probably look elsewhere.It's a beautiful love letter to Wipeout 3, it handles like a dream and its PS1-era aesthetic is faithfully recreated exceptionally well. The game demands precision, and will punish you with death for the slightest mistake. Come correct. You will go fast. You will go faster. You will become the fast. You will transcend fast.Final score: 2097 / 2159			",76,5,4,7,3,0,5

								I've only played half an hour of this so far and I'm instantly hooked. BallisticNG reminds me strongly of my teenhood, spent in front of a clunky old Playstation, playing Wipeout, Wipeout XL and Wipeout 3. I've got the game running quite smoothly on my machine with settings turned as far up as I can get them, and it is so, so delicious.At first, I thought I recognized the tracks, but as I played through, I realized that no, I've never seen these tracks, but the details put into them are so reminiscent of Wipeout 3 that the game could just about fit into the series.All I need now is Sasha's 'XPander' playing on an endless loop, or maybe some Chemical Brothers, and I'll be ensconced firmly in the late '90s again, dodging plasma bolts and energy walls.My compliments to the Dev -- I can tell you're here for the love, with the attention put into the game. Thank you.			",304,52,10,34,39,1,52

								What a fantastic thing!  BallisticNG GETS future racing: the exhilarating speed, the trance-inducing electronic score, and a delicious aesthetic that rides the line between elevated and industrial.  For a PC gamer who's a fan of the genre, this game is very rare and special indeed.  BallisticNG is still a work-in-progress right now, so there are some usability issues that crop up: navigating the game's menu via a controller is a rather haphazard affair (up and down did not work on my controller's joystick), the racetrack selection screen would really benefit from a visual preview of the track you are selecting, and the tutorial needs an overhaul (put that beautiful pilot guide in the game!).  Even so, the work that remains seems paltry in comparison with what has already been accomplished - the game is a joy to play, it runs well, and it's full of beautiful little touches, such as custom cockpits for every racecraft, that really emphasize how much love and care has gone into this game.  Were BallisticNG a futuristic racecraft, consider me thoroughly strapped in and along for the ride.			",58,42,2,13,1,0,3

								It's Wipeout.this is essentially a carbon copy of Wipeout.In a sea of games that try to be Wipeout, but just fall short, this game really stands out.Now, don't get me wrong, I like games like RedOut, but it still strives to do something significantly different than Wipeout.this is a fast paced racer that has a tendency to become hectic in later stages. With weapons and tools at your disposal, you can slow your opponents down, or even straight-up eliminate them, making one less ship you have to pass.The ships are kinda slippery, and that takes a bit of getting used to, but that's how original Wipeout was. regardless, there is an option present to make the ships flying a bit more tight.My only major gripe is the fact that the AI kinda stops offering you a challenge at a point.When your in the thick of it, sure. you're dodging and weaving, and fighting back with just as much furiosity. but once you pass that ship in lead, it's not too hard to make your getaway. and then that's it. you're soon lapping your opponents.It's still in Early Access as I'm writing this, so it may change.but it's nice to see that someone actually took the time and effort to, essentially, make Wipeout. And shocking that it was made free.*Edit* so as it turns out, my game defaulted the AI to the lowest difficulty setting... hmn.			",289,46,5,48,9,2,16

								Easily the best AG Racing since Wipeout, and it's Early Access and free!The game is extremely similar to Wipeout, and that is by far the best thing about it. Games that try to be a bit more different, like Redout or even Formula Fusion end up just feeling off instead of fun. Instead, BallisticNG has gone with bringing together the best parts of every Wipeout game. Zone mode? Check.Campaign mode? Check.Floaty physics with extremely responsive controls? Check.Old school EDM soundtrack? Check.And it's all wrapped in a nostalgic package that also gives you ample amounts of options for play and modding. Imo, it's the perfect love letter to Wipeout.Currently, my only gripes are that the Very Hard AIs jump an extreme amount in difficulty from the Hard AIs, making it basically impossible for anyone who doesn't already know the game perfectly to stand a chance. Currently, I just can't complete any campaign node with Very Hard AIs. Some Time Trials seem to be similarly impossible. The nodes themselves within the campaign also vary wildly in difficulty instead of steadily teaching you and challenging you, which is strange.But, as I believe campaign was added relatively recently and knowing that this is an early access game (with the ability to unlock everything anyway), it is perfectly understandable. And the game is still immensely fun to play.tl;dr DOWNLOAD IT. It's fantastic. It's free. It's Wipeout.			",10,2,2,4,0,0,0

While it might not be 100% perfect, it's definitely 99% of the way there and is a blast to play.Contains a satisfying amount of tracks and ships, all of the staple game-modes (including the Zone mode from the later WipEouts, branded as Survival here) and a great OST.With support for custom* ships, tracks and music, this is the definitive arcade AG racer. Cannot recommend enough and am extremely stoked for the full release.* May not be fully functional at time of review (V0.4)			",53,6,8,5,3,0,1

								In simplest terms you fly an anti gravity(hovering) vehicle over a track at really high speeds while racing. You have powerups to help hurt the competition or give you an edge like weapons/shields/autopilot pickups and they are all pretty good.Pros-Truely FREE and NO microtransactions of any kind.-Has a decent amount of vehicles to choose from and workshop support to get plenty more.-Good deal of tracks. They look quite nice imo.-You can practice a track without AI which is quite nice.-Sometimes a map has jumps which are obviously always cool.-Powerups are pretty good. You can definately mess with the competition using them.-All you need to make your own ship is a model and a texture file and after that customize stats, engine placement, and trails. So easy to make a ship. Content creators rejoice!Pro/Cons(Depending on what you like)-You have shields. You need to make pitstops to refill them. This will be somewhat difficult to manage if you are ramming into walls and getting hurt.-AI are pretty darn good. (You will have some competition)-High speed and you use airbrakes and skillful turns to help you win the race.-Graphics are going to be really win/lose for many people. If you like the look of this game you will absolutely love every second of how it looks just like I do. It feels so old school and I love it.-Can be a bit unforgiving. I like that personally.ConsI can't really think of a flaw. Only things you might dislike rather than a core flaw in the game. Maybe mention one or I'll put one later if I can find one. Updates are coming to fix some missing features as well in ship editor/track editor which will be amazing I'm sure.It is free. So you really should give it a try. You might have fun with it.

								Ballistic NG is quite the breath of fresh air in a world of poorly developed gamed either made free with the intention of conning people from their money or made to cost about 10 dollars wiht the intention havingf them play long enough to screw them over on their Steam refund if it tu8rns out to be crap.So, do I recommend this game? Yes, certainly. And here's why.""I present to you.... HI-HO SILVAH! AWAAAAAAAY!""The first and rathewr important part of this game is that it's completely FREE. no subscriptions, no microtransactions, 100% free. IT's very reminiscent of WipEout according to my friends, in fact, the trailer itself explicitly says it pays HOMAGE to the first 3 WipEout games. Lastly, the nicest thing I see here, is that the ""Why Early Access?"" bubble actually looks rather self-critical than like it's trying to promote itself as being built by the community and not actually listening. The developer behind this game is constantly updating. Something most unheard of from titles like Starbound from Chucklefish, Robocraft from Freejam, or Killing Floor 2, from TWI. Each of which having committed their own series of offenses.""So... What's in the bag?""A look without touching the game shows it goes all the way back to the original Play Station's graphical fidelity. I personally like it, but the people who are crazy for graphical quality might get turned off. Needless to say, don't let it turn you away. After all, it's completely free, and the developers intend to keep it that way.The controlds feel slick and smooth and respond nicely, although it's better with a controller in some cases. I've played using both a controller and a keyboard for the first campaign section as far as I could go, and they both feel very responsive. My only complaint is that the controls could still use some minor improvements from how they currently are, but nothing truly too severe.The frame rate is quite silky smooth, even with my obsolete hardware here, and I can vouch that it'll run fine on a toaster. Since it only needs about 183 Megabytes of space on a 64-bit Windows 7 computer, it doesn't take up much space, which is a fantastic detail to note.[n]""GRAPHICS!""[/b]There's quite a few options, but nothing to increase texture quality. While that is a bit of a let-down, there's nothing to really worry about in that regard. The rest makes up for it.Draw Distance going from 30 to 144 is quite nice, and the only other games I've seen with a draw distance function are Minecraft and Firefall, but we don't talk about Firefall any more. The horror... Anyway...FXAA filtering. Very nice.Bloom - A nice little addition as well.Camera damage - For those of you who like to immerse yourselves.And even more that you can mess around with in your gameplay settings for your HUD and some other little functions. Sweet, right?Resolutions also go from the old CRT-grade 640x480 all the way to your typical 1080 pixel resolution quality at 1600x900, a very nice variety. With this kind of game, 4K resolution isn't all that necessary. So yeah. Some nice functions in this game to buff up the quality.""IS it still fast and furious like the last games....""Yes. Yes it is. It feels just as fast as it should be, which is awesome. However, as you ascend hills, the speed can slow to a frantic sprint at times. Not quite as fast as a super sonic craft going up a hill, frankly. That said... The gameplay is amazing. You have, so far, 7 different power-ups you can grab during the race: Cannon, Plasma, Missile, Rocket, Mines, Auto-pilot and Shield.In addition to this, you have a large variety of ships for a title like this. There's easily more than 10 to choose from, including another whole column of ships you can unlock. And that's not yet mentioning the Ship Importer, which I'll get to later in this review. And each of these craft have their own unique stats, so there are plenty of ways to play this game.And yes, you can still destroy other racers as you make your rounds about each track. But be careful, the same will happen to you, and you only progress to the next race upon reaching First Place. As the game is now, it's not too much of a challenge to achieve in the first Campaign section, but I don't know about the other two yet.Another cool feature is online mode. Try it. Tell me what it's like, because my internet is just barely better than a 56K modem at the moment. It... Kind of sucks. *hangs head in shame*There's three ""Campaign"" sections, and I haven't beaten even one of them yet as I've been busy with other titles. That said, if you don't feel like unlocking everything the old fashioned way, then you can go to the profile tab in the main menu of the game and go to ""Unlock Everything"" to... Yup, you guesssed it: UNLOCK EVERYTHING, but this disables achievements, so beware.""YOU CAN MOD!?""Yup. You can put in custom tracks, vehicles and music into the game, which is pretty freaking awesome, but at the moment, the feature isn't functional. I'm assuming it'll come out at a later time. So since this game is of such upstanding quality at the time I found it? ESPECIALLY for an Early Access title? This feature will get a free pass from me since the entire thing is free and I'll review it when it's out and there's tracks and vehicles to try out.It WILL have Steam Workshop support, I believe, so hang in there, folks.""YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY NOW!?""Now, for the lingering issues I feel. Sometimes the game will chug a bit on my crapper toaster here, but with my kidn of crap computing power, that's to be expected. There isn't much you can do with a Mobility Radeon HD 4250 when it doesn't even reach a full 256 Megabytes of VRAM (It only has 252.6... x_x), but for what this product presents, its a nice blast to the past.Some of the power-ups can feels a bit dumb, and some can actually be WAY too powerful, but each is balanced enough to function as they are.... All of them except Auto-Pilot. If you activate Auto-Pilot and pass by an armed contender when you're alreadyb low on energy, you won't be able to dodge as he blasts you into a smoldering black heap of metal debris on the track. Not too exciting there.""Final Verdict?""I'ds give this game an 8.6 out of 10. IT feels good, the sound, game, environment, everything looks very nice. There's only a few things missing, and a few other things that could really use some tweaking, but beyond that? This is serious quality for low gaphical fidelity. A pleasant breath of fresh air in 2016 when games have stagnated for 5 years straight now.Give it a whirl. I think you'll definitely enjoy this game if you enjoy racing games.			",71,0,1,0,5,1,1

								BallisticNG is a free version of the PSone versions of Wipeout,especially 2097 and 3.The ships you will fly all differ in stats,and all behave differently,just like in Wipeout, there are ships for beginners with good handling and low speed, fast heavy ships with poor handling  and even some fast and maneuvrable ships with low shields, try to find your own!You will fly them on various tracks that have this old-school feeling doing  much with little5 different speed classes are present, they will suit everyone, from sunday drivers to insane record hunters.Keep in mind that this is an hommage to older games,mistakes are heavily punished, walls slow you down immensly,you can die pretty often(mostly from walls),and there is no hand telling you permanently what to do.Controls are not ""clunky"",""strange"" or ""unusual"", no no, you're just not good enough yet.It takes time to master the game, try again, and again until you start making perfect laps, then increase the speedclass each time.If you really like challenges or if you are a masochist, you can try flying the Nexus ship in the highest speedclass(Zen).Can't wait for multiplayer!

								Totally brilliant homage to the Wipeout games on PS!. It even lets you import custom-made ships and tracks and music - even the original ships from Wipeout 2097.The music was an integral part to the original Wipeout games. Whilst the original driving techno music in BNG is good, don't be surprised to find yourself importing your own FSOL, Fluke and Chemical Brothers sounds for added authenticity.Playing with a 360 controller is a joy, it's responsive and smooth. The graphics are deliberately and suitably basic and pixely giving the felling of those old PS1 games. Like the original Wipeouts, some of the tracks have a steep learning curve, especially at high speeds. And like the originals, BNG demands practice and an investment of time to get good. Before long you'll think it was 1995 all over again. 10/10Btw, that Robbie Williams should go solo, I think he'll do ok - you heard it here first folks!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								It's basically Wipeout. This is a GOOD THING. Plus it's free. Nostalgia for the PS1 era without having to mess with emulators or dig your PS1 out of storage. Works great with an xinput controller. I reckon they deserve a couple of quid for their patreon too tbh. I wanna see what they make next.			",192,32,43,16,25,0,23

								Lower your resolution to 512x384 and you're literally playing Wipeout XL.In all honesty, this is amazing. I've been waiting for a modernized Wipeout clone for a while, and this one's doing that and more. Open source, great soundtrack, good gameplay right off the bat. It's got some rough edges, but it's literally been in development for about a year. I'm so glad this is out.pls add the github back			",81,7,3,2,2,0,5

								This is a very nice nod to Sony PlayStation's classic WipEout. Its now one of my favorite PC racing games now. I am amazing by the effort the developers did in course design as well, it actually feels like a really good spiritual successor to WipEout with decent controls and item abilities.

								**Low playtime on Steam Build, but I've put at least 20 Hours into builds 0.3_2 & 0.4**I've been hopelessly addicted to Ballistic NG for the last week or so. I'm always on the lookout for good anti-grav racing titles. A lot have disappointed me in the past, as I couldn't help but hold each of them up to the same standard as the WipEout games. Ballistic NG changes that - it's cut from the very same cloth as XL and WipEout 3. It FEELS like WipEout 4.The controls are perfect - if you've played any of the first 3 WipEout games, then you'll be able to jump straight in, no problems. It's THAT spot-on. Even the behaviour of the camera is identical, and this contributes a lot to the game's authentic WipEout feel.Graphically, it's a PSX game with modern touches, and that's fine with me. A lot of hard work has gone into re-creating this style, and it pays off in spades. It also means the game is incredibly scalable - the game runs near flawlessly on my Razer Blade 14 2013 edition.I really can't say enough good things about the sound. It\'s WipEout - Von Snake & Friends have done an amazing job creating a soundtrack worthy of it's heritage, with nods to the most classic songs in WipEout history. They're genuinely great tunes, not pale imitations. The custom sound support is the icing on the cake. I threw in some CoLD SToRAGE, Sasha (Xpander!!!) and other classic WO tunes, and it only drives home the point that much more that this is the follow-up to the classic anti-grav games we've been waiting for.I haven't even touched on the other custom aspects of the game. The fact that it's open to custom ships and tracks is something I cannot wait to see spring to life. It has potentially a lifetime's worth of classic WO courses in it. Here's hoping the Steam Community really embraces Ballistic NG, it deserves it.For Ballistic NG to have this amount of content, and this amount of polish in a year's worth of development is, quite frankly, nuts. If you're an anti-grav racing fan from the 90's, then Ballistic NG is, quite literally, made for you. By fans, for fans, and bang-on in nearly every aspect. Open-source, and free, there's really no reason to miss out on this one.			",223,33,30,17,10,1,20

								*low gameplay time on the steam build but i have been playing since early beta releases*A game that manages to capture the essence and beauty of the original WipEout games so well that the later series simply cannot. Gameplay difficulty is brutal yet rewarding, track design is varied and interesting, craft designs are unique while still keeping a similar WipEout art style and most importantly it's on PC. I have been following BallisticNG now for some time since it's first beta release, the game is open source and is free for anyone to check out and download. If you're a fan of the original three WipEout games that are on Playstation then this is seriously worth picking up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								First off, no, this is no BeamNG parody. (you should have noticed that by the screenshots though)Hello and welcome. My Name? Irrelevant. You can see it anyway if you´re not legally blind and cannot see. If you are...... how the hell are you reading this? Ok, we´re slowly drifting away from the review here.  MOVING ON.What is dis?Not gonna lie and its gonna come up a few times in this review, but this really is Wipeout.If you don´t know what Wipeout is -first off you´ve missed something in life mate- Wipeout is a racing game set in the future with racing gliders, developed by Psygnosis for the PS1 in the late 90s. And because people in the future have gone mental, you can acquire weapons in the race and kill the other racers. You could say Wipeout is the perfect mix of F-Zero and Mario Kart. Only a bit more serious.How does it look?The devs of BallisticNG really focused on making the game look like on the PS1 again. No sarcasm implemented. Seriously, there even is the old model flickering straight up ported from the PS1 in the game! But of course you can enable some more modern effects to make the game look good, like FXAA and Post-Processing and so on. But said effects don´t change much. I´m playing with max graphics settings and it still looks like the good old original. Only on a higher resolution.Performance?Nice. Although I have two GPUs in my laptop (slower Intel chip + stronger Nvidia card) I can run BallisticNG on the BS Intel Chip with 1600x900 resolution and max settings at 100% fluid 60fps.How does it handle?Wipeout mate. Wipeout. But this is way more suited to driving with keyboard. I´ve tried playing Wipeout 2097 with an emulator on the keyboard. It felt terrible. This on the other hand drives way better and it´s very fun, even if you only have a keyboard.Plot?You´re a nameless Racing Driver, driving through your career. You unlock new gliders with more victories. The End.Oh, and you can make your own gliders. The game has an integrated editor for gliders, which makes it super easy.If you like your work you can send it straight to the workshop.Workshop?Workshop.Music?Classic old fast electric music. (Excuse me, I don´t have any clue what genre this is) Wipeout.The music in this game is very nice and has an awesome boosting effect. But I think it could use some more music. Sometimes I get the feeling that the songs are repeating all the time.Bugs?Well, I have only met one yet. That was me falling through the world because I took a corner too fast, flew off the track and through the wall that has no collision whatsoever.Features?Some are locked, because Early Access. Online multiplayer e.g. is listed on the main menu but not accessible yet.Basically, if you´re an old Wipeout veteran and are still waiting for Sony to actually develop another one, because we´re waiting for about 9 years for a new one now, show Sony the longest finger on your hand and play this instead.(after nine years of development, hopefully it would have been worth the weight. #PraiseGabeN) ",136,7,33,3,5,1,5

								After the closing of Studio Liverpool, there was a sinking feeling I would never get to see another WipEout game atleast for a long time, and while the Omega collection is coming, it's more of what I have played, but the this game came out as a light of hope, bringing with it new tracks and new challenges. At first the old WipEout handling was all new to me, but now I love it. I have now played the first WipEout game and I feel they took the better handling engine from the old WipEouts and gave it the more forgiving nature of walls in the new WipEout games. Which overall is better, hitting a wall certainly is not desirable and does dish out a proper punishment to your time, however I feel I don't need to restart a race for grazing the exit of a turn.  In WipEout 1 hours of frustration made you learn the track in and out to even progress, and while that had it's own merits of making the game a great challenge, it was mostly a crutch for making you stay playing the lack of content for longer. It is something that would not go down very well in the modern industry where exessively hard games do not go down well. This game takes that out, while still having an emphasis on trying to learn a track, it no longer forces you to play it for hours to learn the track. It also fixes the issue the old WipEouts had that the difficulty compensated for, the lack of tracks to keep you occupied if you blew threw them on your first attempt. With more tracks available now than in the any of the old WipEouts, as well as workshop and track builder, we won't be lacking tracks soon. As well as taking the great handling of the old WipEout games, they have gone the extra mile of offering the new handling from the Pure and on games, which is very appreciated as they were what I entered the series on. All this paired with the great retro style graphics running at modern resolutions, this is far better than an emulator could ever offer. The only thing really missing here is, well, WipEout, it doesn't use the old teams we know and love, for obvious reasons, but mods can and are helping that, it's just a shame Sony closed Studio Liverpool. I would like to see these developers try to make a lore similar to WipEout's but the game is fine without it, and for free, it's more than worth the download.			",24,2,14,1,2,0,0

								QUICK SUMMARY:This is essentially a clone, for nostalgia and for hardcore fans as well as newbies who are interested, of the original 3 psx WipEout titles (WipEout, WipEout 2097, Wip3out). If the game feels ""dated"" or ""old school"", you know why.SERIOUS TIME! WHAT IS BNG?The closest thing you will EVER get, at this moment, to a recreation of the physics of WipEout on PSX.Plays wonderfully and the learning curve is STEEP esecially for beginners. I highly recommend trying Practice mode with the three prototype tracks and different vehicles. That'll get you in the grove and will teach you cornering. Not too much content yet but these guys are working their asses off hardcore on this thing and having impeccable gameplay and good AI that feels nostalgic is just ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.PROS- the physics are almost, ALMOST perfect. More notes on that below.- The AI is defaulted to easiest and has a nice natural feel to get you into the groove.- The stages feel great and each stage gets crazier, a very nice comfortable learning curve especially for hardcores.- The ships feel varied, just like the psx wipeout titles- Music is good. Overall style feels nostalgic. c:CONS- Very VERY hardcore. There doesn't appear to be much of an ""incredibly easy, for the sake of learning"" track, like that of Talon's Reach in WipEout 2097 on the PSX.- For people unfamiliar with the WipEout games, the controls are incredibly technical and steep. The first campaign speed class could use some slowing down for the newbies.- Wall collisions are really tight, tighter than on PSX, in terms of ""feel"", in my opinion.- On long winded turns, AI sometimes drops 3 mines dead center at once that are almost impossible to avoid, ruining a race and crushing health. Maybe there could be a way to prevent close AI from earning the same items and ruining a strong laptime.- Sometimes (very rarely) ship clips through walls on some tracks. It's to my understanding that y'all are gonna work out those kinks. c:EXPLANATION OF PHYSICSOkay, so, this game, following on the formula of the PSX wipeouts (most notably WO3) has some very unique wall collisions.Essentially, as long as your nose is relatively parallel to the track wall, you will grind against the wall without hitting it or taking damage so long as you're on track. Once you're more than say 20 or so  degrees off with your craft's nose, BANG, you lose all your speed. Just like the oldies.The airbrakes will slowly shift your nose and also cause your ship a loss of traction. This has an advantage: in holding both brakes you get to slide your nose, ahead of time, into corners, at the cost of a lot of speed.Airbrake and nose control (you press up and down to keep your ship balanced for jumps and hills) is very necessary to master the game, especially past the first set of stages in campaign.** On this note, I would like to say that I think there should be more leeway on the degree to which your nose can be parallel to the wall, and how far into the wall you can fly, before the game determines a collide. The room for error feels quite a bit steeper than in PSX wipeout; right now it's somewhere between original WO1 (no wall grinding) and WO3 (loose wall grinding), and the psx games greatly favored the back ends of the ship for grinding to accomodate your ship sliding through turns. I would definitely give this game some tweaking.My method of turning corners consists of two to three steps, try and practice this, it is unique to BNG:1) Turn in the direction of the next turn while punching that side's airbrake to quickly shift your nose parallel to where the turn looks like it's gonna leave you off. (If it's a 45 degree turn, hard punch that airbrake till your craft rotates about 45 degrees)2) While still turning in that direction, quickly release the airbrake and HOLD DOWN THE OPPOSING AIRBRAKE. Holding down the airbrake that OPPOSES the direction of your turn basically removes all traction from your ship and causes a slide3) If you're entering too fast, punch down both brakes instead of the opposing brake. It's better to lose most of your speed than to punch a wall. Walls drastically hinder your acceleration.Cheers, and happy playing!			",93,4,2,2,1,0,0

								I personally love this game, though I will try to write a non-biased review.This game's art style is perfect, people will disagree.This game's controls... Very nice, though there are a few things to be improved upon.This game's AI, Meh... not the worst I've seen.This game's story, pretty sure there isnt one.To be improved?The games controls, while being very nice and easy(ish) to learn, really do need a tutorial. As much as I hate saying it. I literally had to look in the control section of the options just to find half a million things I could have been using to help me during the campaign.The Games AI... While not being the worst, I think that no-clipping through the AI and other players should be a thing. It is quite irritating to get up to speed, taking out players left and right, and then clip the person in 1st's wing and have all the energy taken off. Just a though.Either way, love the game... Love that you brought back an old school esque race system and the music... ear ♥♥♥♥♥♥s for days ;)			",83,15,6,14,11,0,7

								As someone who has played Wip3out, Fusion, Pulse and HD-Fury, this is an amazing thing to see. Given how difficult it is to emulate the PS1 WipEout games (not that I would endorse emulation, unless perhaps a game costs over 100€ and there really isn't a way to get it digitally). This, however, feels like playing Wip3out all over again, its such a perfect tribute to just how great those games were. I may sound like I am just gushing all over the game, but the fact is that if you want a true old PS1 Wipeout experience, get this game. I even went and put some money on this because I would not be able to play such a product of love and dedication for free.<3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								A real Wipeout clone which plays very nice even in this early state. The graphics are well done but don't expect the HD details of modern games. It's supposed to be an homage to the old Wipeout trilogy, so the design is like in those games (but still with HD resolution). The audio is fine (a few more sound effects would be nice) and the gameplay is just like in the old Wipeout(s). There are still some glitches (the turbo button doesn't always work and you get off the track quite easily imo) but the game is very fun in overal. It's free more than that, so if you like AG Racing, give it a try!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I love this game. The rendition of the ""floaty"" style physics is spot-on and the graphics are reminiscent of my favourite game, Wipeout 3; they're clean, crisp, and simple. Challenging though games like this tend to be, I got very comfortable with the mechanics early on. The only thing that I don't like is the pinballing from side to side when you collide with the wall, it seems a bit excessive to me. Four, five times ping-ponging back and forth.

								How did I not know about this earlier?  Amazing!  What a year or two this has been for a revival of anti-gravity racing games.  And while I'm pretty stoked with the game by the actual ex-WipEout devs... this is a wonderful retro stylized throwback to WipEout XL and Wip3out (my favorites of the series), it just brings back so many good nostalgic feels.  Keep up the good work devs!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								When I Read the description, and saw this in the store, the first thing I thought was: ""Huh, a clone of Wipeout."" After trying it out, I Must say, this game wants to evoke the aura of the games so badly, the graphics look like they came straight from the PlayStation, complete with model jittering (A nice Touch)! The game feels fast paced, almost like the Wipeout Games, which I belive is 100% intentional. That being said there are some downsides to it, but this is due to the fact that this is still an early access title, and not fully finished yet. There is no multiplayer (local or online) yet, it feels like there are too little race tracks in the game (A flaw shared with the PS1 Wipeout Games), and several things in the game scream ""Work in Progress"".  Then again, the game is free, so there's no point complaining about something that is free. The System requirements are very low for today's standards, so I recommend trying the game out for yourself, and see what you think. You might Be more impressed than I am... or less so.P.S: Despite what the store says, there is some controller support. You do need to enable it manually, however, as the game assumes that you want to play with the keyboard.			",26,3,1,0,8,0,0

								Can't thank the devs enough for making this!!THIS could very well be the Wip3out successor I've been waiting 17 years for. Looks like wipeout 3, feels like 2097. Love where this is going. Keep up the good work and thanks again.If you want that PSX feel, crank the res right down to 640x480, draw distance down all the way and feel the nostalgia flow. :-D Though I did cheat by having the frames at 144 and yes I know the PSX version was lower res still - (512x240 I think)BTW devs: might want to look into making the menus readable at 640 lol!

								Alright, so it's definitely a knock-off of Wipeout.  They're not reinventing anything, and it's rough around the edges.The development effort on this game is surprising considering they're giving it out completely for free.  They've added splitscreen and are currently working on online multiplayer.  They also added a handling mode that makes the game play like Wipeout HD; as someone who only played Wipeout HD and not the PS1-era games, this feature is really important to me.  They've announced that they're reworking all of the tracks, so we'll see how much that helps the game.  Seeing all these features get added makes me hopeful.The game isn't fantastic... yet.  Keep your eyes on it and wait to see how it turns out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I thought that getting a good futuristic racing game from a modern developer (outside of, hopefully, Formula Fusion) was as likely as an European studio ever making a good shmup. I'm glad to say that this game has proven me wrong. There's no superficial nostalgia here, this is the real deal: completely skill based with spot-on controls and physics and no unnecessary gimmicks.I do wish we didn't have to depend on devs replicating 20 year old games' formulas to a T, but if the alternative is awful mobile ports or lazy VR showcases I welcome this trend with open arms.One last thing: this game controls like the 32-bit Wipeout games, so be aware of that if all you've played is something like HD or Pure.

IntroductionThis is an excellent love letter to the Wipeout games of the PlayStation and PC generation of the 1990s. This game sets out to be an imitation, and succeeds very well at capturing the look and feel of the original entries in the series.MechanicsThe mechanics feel closer to the subject matter than any other imitation I've played. Steering feels precise, and the physics closely resemble those found in Wipeout. I would even say they improve upon the original games, as colliding with walls is more forgiving. Controller detection and integration is also intuitive.GraphicsGraphically, the look of the game is a solid rendition of the original games. I think this is a brilliant move, as it sets the graphical fidelity for the game at a reasonably obtainable level of detail, while successfully achieving the look that they set out to attain. The game looks better in action than in the screenshots shown, especially at max settings and with V-SYNC enabled, and are nostalgic. They even included PS1 era vertices. SoundWipeout is known for its music selection, and again the choices made here faithfully reproduce the music styles of the 1990s that were featured in the Wipeout series.ConclusionIf you're a fan of Wipeout, or other anti-gravity racers like the seminal F-Zero, then I recommend trying this game.

								As a fan of the old Wipeout series, I may be biased with my review.But I love this game, it's in early access so there are a few bugs, but from what I have played thus far, it's very, very enjoyable!For me, it brings back a plethora of memories from the days of playing Wipeout 2097(Or Wipeout XL as it was known in the US) with my brother in the 90s.It is such a breath of fresh air when it comes to games of this type, the attention to detail and dedication which clearly shows from what I have played.The controls are a tad on the sensitive side, but with a few tweaks it handles really well.The graphics are a throwback to the days of old, thrown together with a fantastic sense of speed.Track design as well as the opportunity to create your own craft and tracks is just amazing, and I guarantee will be a great hub for track builders and craft builders alike!I cannot stress that this game is early access, bugs are commonplace but for me, the perfections are in the imperfections, and with some well dedicated TLC this game will be a polished gem that many people will enjoy!

								This game is a love letter to my childhood. The original wipeout for sega saturn is the first video game I can remember playing. Since then the series has spawned several seuquels but the series has lost a lot of its appeal to me. The original trilogy, and to some degree wipeout fusion, will always be the pinnacle of the series to me. This game faithfully recreates the Wipeout of old (the first three games). It has a good techno soundtrack and all of the futuristic 90s racing that I know and love. (I would say great soundtrack but nothing can beat the soundtrack from the saturn version of wipeout 1 imo). If you're a classic wipeout fan there is no reason not to download and play this. It's free FFS!Also it has freaking mod support! (Tracks, Ships, Custom Sound Tracks)			",200,11,7,21,9,0,44

								A must-have Wipeout 2097 era cover that hits exactly the right spots in both presentation and gameplay. There was something very special about the original Wipeout games, with design impact on AG racers similar to how Quake III influenced arena shooters; I am joyous to say the developers succeeded in recapturing this magic inside BallisticNG.Perfect controls, adjustable PSX-class visuals (jiggly vertices just pleased my heart), recognizable sounds with a typical electro soundtrack and a stylish UI that hits home. A project that certainly deserves more exposure and financial support as it is clearly on the right track with immediate and well deserved cult status.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And it does exactly that. The visuals, the music, the gameplay, it is just WipeOut through and through. For those that want their retro AG Racing fix but do not want to set up or deal with emulators, this is for you.Visit WipeOutZone for information on this title and one other fan made game that deserves a Steam release!

I realize the music is probably tough because you don't have the access to all kinds of electronica artists like Studio Liverpool did, but right now none of the songs really stand out.

								I really like this Wipeout-inpired game. :D It REALLY reminds me of the only Wipeout Demo I played on my PSP. :P I really like how it's turning out too with all the custom music, ships, tracks etc. I also love the pixellated look of it and how the ship smoothly hovers and drives over the track when you drive it right.The only things I don't really like are how the ship stops immediately even if you don't crash directly (I know it's intentional but I just wanted to put it out there :P), the fact that the outside terrain is not solid (don't know if it's intentional or not) and some minor bugs which I'm sure you're able to fix.Overall, it's a cool-looking indie version of Wipeout which I'm sure it will spark nostalgia for Wipeout players. I also recommend it for people who like futuristic racing games which have a fast-paced feel and that take time to master.Regards,Andracer108			",28,12,3,4,2,1,1

								One of the best FTP Early-Access racing games out there.Fluid controls and beautiful levels, fast-paced and extremely addictive, BallisticNG (Often shortened to BNG) is a futuristic competitive game that you will play with your friends in the near future. This game is pretty inovative because your racing ""ship"" has health. You can reload this health in the pit. So far this game only has singleplayer, but in that menu you get 5 gamemodes: Arcade, TimeTrial, Practice, Tournament, and Survival.Arcade is a gamemode where you race against 7 opponents and try to get the best lap time over 5 laps.TimeTrial is a gamemode where it is pretty self-explanitory. You race against the clock for 3 laps and try to beat your best time.Practice is self-explanitory. (I hope noone asks what this gamemode is)Tournament is where you play against one opponent and race for a few laps. Then you move to the next level, if you win. And on and on. Until you win the tournament.Survival is where you cannot regain health. You keep the pedal to the metal and keep going around the track until you eventually destroy yourself.I'm very excited for further development of this game. I hope whoever reads this reveiw decides to take the game. I mean, why wouldn't you? It's free!			",42,7,4,5,5,0,4

								This game is a love letter to the early wipeout franchise pre-fusion. I highly recommended this if you are prone to the warm nostalgia feelings for classic wipeout. It does those games justice. Pros:* All the classic weapons are available.* The ships have that bouncy goodness that you get if you don't practice good pitch control. This speaks volumes about the attention paid to the controls in the game. It feels like Wipeout. * Wip3out style menus and the ability to add custom tracks. * Pretends like Fusion never existed. :DCons: * Background is a bit plain and occasionally I can see the track pop in to view. Needs to take better advantage of newer hardware (but this can be forgiven because of the games it replicates). Not a big gripe, but it can distract. * I flew through a wall....* The standard sound pack could stand to be beefier. Wants:* A zone mode.			",9,3,2,1,0,0,0

								Okay - six hours in and i can safely say i love it.I grew up with Wipeout 3, and jesus christ does this emulate it well (not to mention the fact it has full port compatability with wipeout 3, you can port ships from the special edition disk if you have it!)but seriously. the game is a liiittle bit basic right now. i somehow feel like something is missing from it.but the game in itself is a glorious little reminder of my childhood. - - - - - - - - - -You get two main styles of play. Retro and Modern. This is toggled by the 2280 mode. When 2280 is off, ships will handle like they did in wipeout 3. Theyll lose a lot of speed in collsions, use a pitlane to repair, and can use hyperthrust.Meanwhile, with 2280 enabled, you cant use the pits or hyperthrust any more, but ships scrape walls instead of smacking into them, and you absorb weapons to get shield energy back.

								BallisticNG is shaping up to be the best anti gravity racer the PC has ever seen. It takes all aspects of the beloved Wipeout games from the PS1 era and builds on top of them to make a much better AG racing exeperience.+ You can add Wipeout, Wipeout 2097 & Wip3out ship files to play in bng campaign for that nostalgic feeling of the old games. Build 0.7 will allow for track porting too.+ Mods. Custom tracks (0.7) & ships from the workshop.+ Ability to add your own music & ship sounds.+ In game track and ship creator, I expect many tracks in the upcoming build.+ PS1 style graphics. Turn on PS1 vertices in options for that wobbly graphical look.+ 2280 mode for fans of WipeoutHD physics, version 0.7 will have Wipeout64 physics added too (Ballistic64)- In current build some tracks need updating.- Some mirror tracks crash the game, so we're currently unable to complete the campaign.- Elite AI seems to be much harder than Hardcore AI- Not a fan of Hardcore AI always banging into your ship slowing you down quite often, but it's still fun as it feels like Burnout 3 where all cars rubber band for a close race!- Multiplayer very buggy in current build, but it's great that it has multiplayer anyways.For a free game, and a very fun one at that; it is definitely worth your time especially if you're a Wipeout fan.

								Absolutely Fantastic! If you've ever wanted to play the old WipEout games, but don't have an older system, then this is for you. It emulates the feeling of the old PS1 Wipeout titles perfectly, from the graphics all the way down to the handling of the craft. With an art style that is obviously trying to pay tribute to WipEout 3 and does an excellent job of it. The tracks in the game are very reminiscent of the WipEout tracks, not only in aesthetic, but also in technicality, with a tough learning curve and progressing difficulty. Besides the visual elements of the game, the sound design is really well put together. The whistling drone of the crafts' engines, the digitilised voices. And a soundtrack that makes me want to go to a rave, also harkening back to the PS1 Era WipEout OSTs which consisted of Trance, Techno and Big-Beat. Moving onto the controls, the keyboard controls feel a tad stiff at times, but you can still acheive perfect laps once you are used to them. However, if you use a controller, everything becomes much more fluid and easier, since these types of games were designed to be played with a controller in the first place.Overall, the game is very well put together for an indie project. With old 32-bit style graphics and an adrenaline-pumping soundtrack, old WipEout fans will be taken on huge nolstagia trips and newcomers serenaded into Anti-Grav Racing games. And as a free game, how could you say no.UPDATE: In 0.4.10, controls have been much improved, keep up the good work.			",68,9,5,6,7,0,2

								Pretty reminiscent of Wip3out, highly customisable, and remarkably smooth playing for something that's still on early access and ironing out a lot of the bugs. Anyone familiar with the Wip3out series will find that their skills transfer (airbraking/pitch/etc.) Can be quite a steep learning curve for beginners but that's why there's practice modes and more. Lots of options so far and looking forward to more being added. For a free game, this easily beats out the other Wip3out competitors right now (that aren't actually Wip3out). I'd love to see an Eliminator play option (similar to what's offered in Fury, where the focus is hitpoints to determine Gold instead of track speed). The game looks retro, but I found it remarkably smooth / sensitive with my controller, with only small and very tolerable amounts of glitches so far. Definitely recommend it, especially to anyone who was ever a fan of any installment in the Wip3out series.			",13,32,1,19,0,0,2

								Wow. This game brought back some great memories. If you are even slightly interested in the old Wipeout series on the Playstation, then you must add this to your collection. It's a mixture of Wipeout, Wipeout XL (2097) , Wipeout 3 & Wipeout HD Fury all in one great package and it's free !! Some great techno tunes really add to the retro feel. I'm running it at 4k with everything maxed @60fps on an i5 6600k & 980 Ti. I've only played 1 hour as I just downloaded it to see what it looked like after being disappointed so many times over the years with other Wipeout clones, but I can definitely say I will be playing lots more hours in the future. This is the best version I've seen bar none. It ran perfectly with an Xbox One controller without having to reprogram the buttons. Add this game to your collection, you won't be sorry you did.

Early Access Review
								BallisticNG is still in Early Access as I write this, my opinion may change as the game develops.BallisticNG is a futuristic racing game which uses anti-gravity ships darting around the track. If this sounds familiar you'd be right. The game is heavily 'inspired' by the original 3 Wipeout games on PS1/PS2/PC. I say 'inspired' because it couldn't be much more obvious.While it obviously can't use the same ship names and so on due to copyright, the game tries to mimic Wipeout as close as it can. The ship designs are new but look like they'd fit right in the PSX games. The way the ships handle feels almost exactly like 2097 did. You steer not only with the regular steering but also with the ship's airbrakes (a concept which will be familiar to anyone who's played either Wipeout or F-Zero). Pulling one airbrake makes the ship veer in that direction, which can be used to 'drift' a corner or slingshot your ship around it. Pulling both slams on the anchors and is really useful for the tightest corners. You can also pitch the nose of the ship up or down to land big jumps better and lose less speed.The tracks share the same kind of futuristic/neon aesthetic as the old games and range from very simple to extremely difficult. The visual style is very low poly and is done deliberately to look more like the old Wipeout games. Most tracks (not all) have a pit lane which will extend your lap time (as it's a longer diversion) but will restore your shields. On the subject of shields, each craft has one of varying strength. The craft are balanced so a fast ship that handles well will generally either have terrible weapons or low shields. A tanky ship with good speed and weapons would typically have awful handling. They all feel noticably different and you'll need to experiment to see which fits your playstyle.Normal gameplay sees you advance through several cups, which consist of multiple races. Finish as best position as you can and don't get eliminated. Each track features weapons pickups you can use to try and eliminate other ships from the race. These range from offensive weapons (rockets, missiles, cannon, plasma) to other miscellanous pickups (shield, which makes you invulnerable to damage for a few seconds) and autopilot (the AI takes over your ship control for a few seconds, great for hard parts of a track!).There's also time trials, free play, survival mode and the game will even soon have online multiplayer. When you consider that all this is free it's amazing.As if that wasn't enough, if you own Wipeout or Wipeout 2097 you can insert the disc and import the ships from it!If I had to pick things to improve...the collision detection can sometimes feel a bit off and one or two tracks probably need adjusting (one track has a corner which you sometimes get stuck on because it goes against gravity and your ship struggles to make it). The in-race UI isn't great; something as important as your race position shouldn't be a small font out of your main field of view. All in all though these are very minor complaints and I would definitely recommend anyone who was a fan of the old Wipeout games to pick this up. It's free, what do you have to lose?

								This review was assembled when BallisticNG was at v0.4.BallisticNG is the closest thing there is to a modern recreation of the classic WipEout games on the original PlayStation back before the end of the 20th century, primarily Wip3out. The level of commitment to this era is very significant, with the low-poly models, low-res textures and limited (but changeable) draw distance deliberately echoing the graphical fidelity of this golden era of home console gaming.Despite the intentional limitations, the game currently plays like a dream for anyone who ever played WipEout back in the day. The keyboard controls are surprisingly good considering the need to manage steering, pitch control and airbrakes, sometimes all at the same time. The track selection is rather generous given WipEout's tendency to not have that many tracks within any singular game (with the exceptions of Pure and Pulse including DLC). The craft selection is also pretty well done and there's even a selection of unlockable bonus ships to fly in.The ability for the game to get custom tracks and ships only makes the deal that much better. This combats the biggest weakness of the actual WipEout games in that, despite being fantastically fun to play, they did ultimately lack in content such as tracks. The planned Multiplayer is the icing on the proverbial cake, it just needs to wait for everything else to come together in due time.I'm very much looking forward to seeing how BallisticNG shapes up over the coming months, and so should anyone who enjoys the re-emerging futuristic racer genre.

Finally, the inclusion of the workshop to allow us to create our own racing machines and share them is a wonderful addition to the game.In conclusion, a well-made racing game that will definitely go far.

								This reminded a lot of playing the original Wipeout for PC back in, what was it, 1996? The look and feel are very very similar, including the low res textures and not so easy handling. So, if you like the Wipeout games, you can't go wrong with this: this is a tremendous effort, well done, and for free! I only wish the handling was a little bit more similar to the later wipeout games, which if I remember correctly was a little bit more fluid. Oh, and a little more polish on the menus and intros and such, would be nice, but this is Early Access, so I imagine it will be worked on.			",94,45,2,21,7,0,20

Controls are fine - you should be playing with a gamepad anyway, and if you're doing that there shouldn't be any major issues.It still feels quite buggy, though. I'm still only getting 40 FPS max on most tracks, and sometimes it even drops as far as 20 on some turns. There doesn't really seem to be much I can do about this. It doesn't seem to matter what resolution I run it in, and it's not like I can tone it down all that much further since all the graphics seem to be something out of the N64/PS1 era.I noticed that short draw distance was kind of a problem on at least one track, and that half a second in which it takes for the next section of track to load is actually very, very important. Framerate also seems to vary quite a bit; this wasn't really an issue on console so I didn't really consider it before, but it really makes navigating a track smoothly really difficult when everything isn't running smooth as silk. Also some corners don't have proper collision, you just pass through it and fall off the track.Anyway the game is basically Wipeout so I won't bother heaping too much praise on the game because it's already been said before.

								If I was told that this came from SCE Studio Liverpool back in 99'-2000 and was never released, I would believe them.Despite looking dated, the game maintains a retro-graphical edge that only further compliments the nostalgia it carries with it. Although games under development can go either way, as it stands, BallisticNG is a solid experience and worth exploring, and if you are a fan of the original WipeOut series, do yourself a favour and check this out.

I cant tell you how much I loved the original trilogy, this game is everything I never even dared to dream. I already imported all the old ships, so amazing. Dont mess this up you guys, I know its still in development, but I love the old art style/asthetic. The poliginalness of it all and good but low res textures. Making the best of what was available at the time and doing it in a way that kicked♥♥♥♥♥is hard thing to emulate when modern resources are so much more capable.

 Summary	Updated as of v0.6A really fun tribute to the early days of WipEout on the ps1. It's a little rough around the edges, sure, but if you enjoyed those old WipEout games - or even the new ones, like me - this game absolutely deserves your attention. Perhaps I just have a very specific taste in racing games (actually, I definitely do), but this is my favourite racer since WipEout HD. Good things	 Fast, hover-y racing mechanics. I never played the old WipEouts, so I can't comment on closeness of simulation - but it feels really great to fly these ships. Amazing throwback to PS1 graphics, with some modern quality-of-life improvements, such as HD resolution and bloom lighting. Really great soundtrack that sometimes sounds 'Tron Legacy'ish and sometimes left me thinking ""This HAS to be from WipEout, it's too authentic!"" Mod support! If you can model and texture a ship, you can fly it! Scraping the walls makes the most satisfying metal-on-metal sound ever. Things that could be improved  Some the feedback to getting hit (and particularly being eliminated) lacks 'oomph'. Some of the tracks are bit erratic and hard to navigate. 0.6 update: The redesigned tracks are much more manageable for a learning player, and look amazing as well! Sometimes, I fly through walls/the terrain. 0.6 update: Much less common in this update. Lack of campaign/obvious ways of tracking my progress beating tracks. Wipeout HD style campaign now included!Note that a couple of the tracks in the latest update are undecorated, but hey - it's free and otherwise works really well.			",48,6,3,1,6,2,10

								This game is still under development, but from what I've seen, it's turning out rather well.I'm a pretty big fan of the WipEout series, so I was very unhappy with the decision to close Studio Liverpool, thus killing off the WipEout franchise.I have been wishing for a true successor to WipEout 2048, so I gave this game a go. Basically, if you have played any of the early WipEout games, you should feel at home. There is even a decent modding community here; the workshop even has actual ships from the WipEout series!I certainly hope that we will see custom track support as well. Who knows, maybe we'll see Vostok Reef, Moa Therma or even Odessa Keys making their debut in this game.Overall, if you're a fan of WipEout, this is a must see. Even if you've never heard of WipEout before, I do recommend giving this a go. Be warned, however, that several elements of this game are still being developed. This is not a finished product right now. I've only really started playing it, but I expect to play it more as it gets developed.I know some players might not care about WipEout (which I understand), but still, I really do hope that this ends up being the WipEout game we've been waiting for. Unless, of course, a certain studio returns... PS. Use a controller if you can			",14,0,17,0,0,0,0

Coupled with the ability to port the ships from Wipeout, Wipeout 2097/XL, and Wipeout 3, as well as Steam workshop support for your own ships, make this a truly great game if you're a fan of anti-gravity racing games.

Wipeout HD was certainly different plus the crafts have sexier designs on the HD I did like Pure and Pulse but I liked Pure better even if I suck at Zone under Phantom Speed. Good old days...

Perfect clone of wipeoutThe entire gameplay is fantastic. You can enter a race in a few seconds (including loading time), the controlls are simple yet achallenging (Do not mistake this with bad controls, they require a lot of practice but they're just basic wasd car controls with 2 side brakes for advanced maneuvering), the AI is on the player's level and far ahead with the different difficultiesSurprisingly good graphics for a barely 1GB game, from textures to backgrounds and only lacking on special effects like the engines trails (which is, in my opinion, a  very  important aspect on these games). The trailers show all of this perfectlyOverall this is a simple game to get into, with tons of depth to keep challenging you on time trials and races. It's just 1GB and the best of all, it's  free  ",81,6,1,11,2,1,14

The genre of racing really sticks out in this game, with your opponents ACTUALLY having skill, and with the controls (Left and Right Brake) making the game more difficult and fun. I have a playstation 2, but I never got wipeout, and I can't really find it in stores. Wipeout looked really fun, and when I played this game, I had a good feeling about it.

								Really, this game is amazing. The genre of racing really sticks out in this game, with your opponents ACTUALLY having skill, and with the controls (Left and Right Brake) making the game more difficult and fun. I have a playstation 2, but I never got wipeout, and I can't really find it in stores. Wipeout looked really fun, and when I played this game, I had a good feeling about it. If you are a casual game player, this MIGHT not be the game for you, but if you like fast racing and the wipeout series, then you will love this game.			",39,4,3,2,7,1,2

								What I like: this game brings me back to my childhood when i used to play wipeout. the tracks are brilliant, the ships are brilliant and the idea of classes is great.improvements: of course the graphics need a bit of improvement especially in the cockpit. one other thing i have noticed is that if your going to fast into a corner in zen class you can glitch through the wall.overall: i love this game and cant wait for future updates.

								A totaly free-to-play clone of the original Playstation 1 WipEout games, with the physics, power-up, an overall style kept intact. There are a fair few tracks in the game as of right now, and they are soon to be redesigned as of the 6.0 update. Coupled with the ability to port the ships from Wipeout, Wipeout 2097/XL, and Wipeout 3, as well as Steam workshop support for your own ships, make this a truly great game if you're a fan of anti-gravity racing games.

								Let me just adress somthing that im seeing alot in the negative comments. They say that the game is impossible to control. that is not true. It may seem hard because as far as i can tell it has a steep learning curve. I love this game already. I loved fast paced furtistic racing games (i.e. Wipeout, F-zero) and was sad to see them go. BallisticNG is trying to revive that genre  even if its cloned. The workshop adds a whole new level to it. Who hasn't wanted to create there own racing game track know (with some coding knowlege) you can. so yeah it is hard to control (at first) and a clone but its realy fun once you get in to it.(p.s. Gamplay over Grapics kinda game)			",72,2,1,8,3,1,0

								In short: a free wipEout clone.Pros:Looks and feels like wipEout 2097.A ton of tracks and ships.Easy to get in, hard to master.Runs perfectly smooth at 60 fps.Fast loading times.Did i mention it's free?Cons:Graphics look dated (but this might be a deliberate design choice).Menus need serious work, especially when navigating with a controller. (Example: There is no simple “press B to go back”, instead, one has to chose the “back” item and select it with A. Cumbersome.)It doesn't come close to the awesome graphics design work of The Designers Republic of the original wipEout (title font, racing team logos, weapon icons, menu system, etc.).(Version 0.6.3 reviewed.)

								Whew damn, time for some good ol' nostalgia. This game has PS1-era graphics with some special effects. I'll make this brief. Pros: + Free+ Small file size (500 mb) + Decent amount of maps/ships + Moddable+ Moderately well paced+ Can run on low-end PCs + Good background music Cons: - Controls aren't the best - No multiplayer (yet) - Lack of content (for now) I like it. It's not groundbreaking, but for a free game, it's pretty fun. The controls are painful to start but you can improve; A controller works best for this game. There isn't any multiplayer, but that's said to be implemented soon enough. If you're looking for amazing graphics, you're not getting them here. If you're wanting something nostalgic, then you're in the right place. It's worth at least a few plays to see if you like it - if you don't, there's no money wasted and there's not much hard drive space used either.			",103,24,1,14,6,1,2

								InShort : Intense heart-stopping and immensely rewarding gameplay....if you're willing to put up with possibly the worst UI design I've ever seen on anything.  Highly recommended.I'd recommend anyone seeking a thrill to give this a shot. The kick you can get out of this game is insane, feels like riding an extreme roller-coaster the entire time. And there's a lotta content out there to keep you occupied for a while. Also, did I mention there's workshop support for some rather sick community content with custom ships n' tracks? Sweet!All I'd request from you when if you try it is a little bit of patience with the game's other minor annoyances. For one, the UI is downright pathethic. Doesn't respond to clicks half the time, and has W mapped to select and LShift mapped to back in the Menu. I mean, only a sadist would come with crap like that. And even the default control scheme is counter-intuitive (on keyboard atleast). But once you do get past those small niggles, my, you could sink hours into this one wiithout even realizing it. Just get used to it, and it'll be nothing less than an edge-of-your-seat joyride after that. Good work, devs!Updates -1. I see some negative reviews complaining about the pod control feeling 'off'. There's a chance you may be right, but I'd suggest you try remapping the controls to my control scheme, as I feel that the poor defaults may be the real reason than the game itself. I'd request you to give it a shot, as there's truly a gem hidden underneath to b found here :)Thrust - UPTurning - LEFT and RIGHTPitch - W and SAir Brakes - A and DBoost - LShiftUse Powerup - SpaceDrop Powerup - QAbove controls are inspired by the defaults of one of my favourite indie titles called Distance. I think this scheme works great for high-speed stunt-boost-p'up fueled racers like this one.2. There're some odd technical hitches in a couple of areas here and there that tends to break the flow, but not enough to put me off game. I noticed random half-second long freezes occuring mid-race that really hurts at times. A bit of playin' has made zero in on two of the situations that trigger this i) Change in Music.ii) Activating Autopilot.I'll update once this is fixed.3. Sounds - The game has great music and environment sounds. The announcer, especially, sounds awesome. But the pod sounds seem to lack that 'whirr and rumble' that I wanted to hear from it. Not really a big deal, but I thought I should put it out there.Thanks for reading,Sel.			",15,0,7,0,0,0,1

								I'd never heard of this game and found it on my discovery cue. What a pleasant surprise. It's basically Wipeout from the original Playstation complete with the authentic PS1 aesthetic, for free. If you've never played a Wipeout game before, it's basically a zero-gravity combat racing game on twisting, looping circuits.  It sits nicely somewhere betwen F-Zero, Rollcage and Xtreme G Racing. As far as actual content goes, there's plenty of ships to choose from and unlock, each with it\'s own handling and speed chareteristics. There are three tournaments available and an unlockable arcade mode with online multiplayer being added soon. The game also appears to have fairly extensive mod support with custom ships, tracks and Workshop integration.The PS1 styling has retro charm for most, but it's going to put some people off. All in all though it's free, you have nothing to lose by trying it.			",761,123,37,79,52,5,94

The graphics are very reminiscent of those from racing games on my PlayStation 1, and have sort of a nostalgic feel to them.I would really appreciate a tutorial somewhere in the game that would let me play around with the controls and maybe teach me about what all the weapons actually do. Having a giant block of text to read in the How to Play section was a little discouraging, but after a few races, I kinda got the hang of it. Even so, I don't understand all the weapons.

								As a huge fan of the Wipeout series, this is actually a very good game. It's very faithful to the original three, older Wipeout games (let's not beat around the bush, this is pretty much a clone with a different name). The gameplay is really tight and the controls are great, and never feel awkward. The track designs are good, though some are better than others. Aesthetically it's not as good as Wipeout though I doubt anyone can come close to the Designers Republic, however it still looks nice. The music is also good and fitting of the style and atmosphere, although slightly forgettable. Though apparently you can add in your own music, but I haven't tried this yet.What I really like is that you get the same sense of speed and thrill as in the classic Wipeout games, and it rarely feels cheap when you fail. On the flipside, it's also very satisfying when you get good at it. The race ships you choose from also have a lot of individuality and variation in both looks and stats which is great.There are a few glitches and bugs, though not hugely noticeable and mostly rare. Once or twice I've appeared to clip through a wall or floor and fall out of the level, and also at times the walls/floors of the tracks appear to vibrate slightly. Also, the graphics aren't the greatest, being somewhere between PS1 and PS2 level. However to be fair this is a (free!) early access game and it's otherwise very solid and complete so I'm not complaining too much.Overall if you're a fan of racers or especially Wipeout then definitely give this a shot. It's not like it'll hurt your bank balance, since it's free! I'd happily have paid a few quid for something of this quality.			",133,15,5,12,11,0,11

								I remember playing Wipeout as a kid and i can say this is insipred by it However there are things that can improve like each level needs to be Unique i played the Turorial level and it seemed pretty good its just the transition between slowand fast is a tiny bit to quick>The maps need to be more direct for example the forest map in Wipeout it was 99% forest themed it had dirt roads there were no cities there was pretty much only trees as i played the tutorial i noticed the map seemed kinda blank it didnt really say if it was a city one or a plain one from the Wipeout i played the first race it took me to diricelt ytold me and showed me from there on what i was doing and playing you need more billboards to make it feel like wipeout i think also the hover planes? ehh you need to put a little more detail into it either than or get rid of it and make all the hover plans just hover or cleverally tuck it and make it more hidden but just visible enough but either way it doesnt matter gameplay is pretty good graphics are fine i think you need to put a tiny bit more story more kinda like wipeout did wipeout kinda showed you were some type of famous racer by mainly ] making the settings loading screens and gameplay look like it also weird thing when i went to single player mode i got 80% lagso i raised the frame cap to the max and it helped at first when i unpaused then it got less laggy then i changed the frame rate to 30 and i uh went through thr track... so yeahhh but it only happened that one time and also i cant seem to use anything i downloaded from the workshop :/ BUT BESIDES THATIts a good game I recommend it Devs need to change a few things to make it more like wipeoutbut to someone whos never heard of it this game is definitely the one for you			",45,8,7,4,12,0,3

								Did a video of this for my channel which should be up soon. Looks promising but, a bit too close to the wipeout games of old. I cannot wait to see what happens with this game in the future, and I really hope the modding goes through the roof!Also there were a few holes in the maps I found... If anybody wants to see how I played and what issues I found. I suggest you take a look at the video

								This game is fun, but mostly for nostalgia's sake.  This is almost exactly Wipeout which I played a lot when i was younger.  THis game is very simple and has some seemingly laggy mechanix.  The 'ships"" feel as though they float and it's difficult to steer with arrow keys, but I still recommend it.  Play it once.			",77,4,4,11,6,0,2

								BallisticNG has everything you'd expect from an anti-gravity racing game, massive modding potential and is free to play as in you don't have to pay for anything in any context.I see a couple of negative reviews that criticize the game's controls. I'd like to mention that between using a controller (xbox360) and a keyboard I've found the controller has offered me much easier handling of all the ships. I personally picking up a Negcon controller as this is undoubtedly the best way to play any ag racing game. But keep in mind a CONTROLLER IS NOT REQUIRED to play BallisticNG, this isn't a case similar to the original Dark Souls port to PC. I'd also like to mention that this game tries to keep on par with the difficulty of early games in the Wip3out series of anti-gravity racing games. Outside of the autopilot power-ups you can pick up on the track there's no piloting assist that'll make up for a lack of skill, so you'd best git gud.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game.. gave me a childhood rush of days of playing Wipeout 64, and how I was just terrible at driving in it. That remains true to this day, but hey I at least won some races here in BallisticNG!There's not much more to say other than if you like Wipeout, you should definitely give this game a try! I mean, it's free!This game has a lot of potential for fun later and I can't wait to see potential multiplayer as well.5/5.~DanIf you want you can check out my first experience with this game below!

								Great game, I just wish the leaderboards weren't full of Barracudas and custom ships. There's not a lot to do yet and having these 'god' ships on the top of every circuit is pretty disappointing.Also disabling weapons only disables them for the player. If you ever wanted to play WipEout and facial Minesweeper at the same time give this a try.And either I'm blind or there are no replays yet? Class A dealbreaker.			",63,2,1,4,2,2,8

								Very faithful to the Wipeout series which is great. I still get that trancy can't blink zone that made the originals so immersive and fun. Everything feels great but for me I can't help but wonder why the old school graphics? I would love this to be soaked in high res textures with a bunch of cool effects. I love the sountrack but can't help but feel it could do with a slightly edgier sound.All in all highly recommended and if the devs decide to stick with the graphics as is maybe add an HD mode? That would be great!Well done! :-)			",100,9,1,12,5,0,17

I've tried using x360ce app to configure my controller as well and it didn't work.Unfortunately I've been unable to test much of in-game because of this.

								tl;dr Recommended for any Wipeout fan and those who want a difficult learning curve with satisfying payoff. Not recommended to absolute beginners just yetedit: things have progressed alot on this game, i love it more than ever thanks to its greatly increased stability, however there are some tracks which are being redesigned. Theres now a campaign grid mode much like wipeout hd fury.I run this on a non gaming laptop (dualcore 2.4ghz with Intel HD 4000 at 1280x720) and get a nicely consistant 60fps with bloom disabledFor those not familiar with Wipeout or Anti Gravity racing : This is a uniquely skill based racing game, based off the Ps1 game series Wipeout. So as well as traditional racing steering there are Air Brakes and Pitch.Air brakes :  these are essential to getting around corners without losing speed they take a little while to get the hang of and with every speed class they become more important and this is where the bulk of the games learning curve comes fromPitch: This is tilting your ship up and down inorder to match the surface of the track to avoid grinding against the floor in certain steep areas or after a jump and while essential is a lot easier to adapt to.As this game is not yet perfect it might be worth introducing yourself to the original series I would say try wipeout 2097/XL and wip3out or wiepout 3 special edition) in order to learn the basics and then come to this.  (the modern series Wipeout Pure/Pulse/HD and 2048 are slightly different handling)Wipeout fans: Dive in you'll either love it or like it and like me eagerly await every update.Okay Ive had about a few hours on this is feels great but not perfect, rest assured its very playable and rings true to the originals, I'm a long term wipeout fan although only just up to rapier on wip3out and can feel the differences it handles more like wipeout 2097, with collisions and style similar to wipeout 3Oh yeah its not free to play as in pay to win this is 100% free and only the skillfull win			",112,14,2,10,2,0,4

								NOTE TO BEGGINERS: Before you cry \'\'HOU DO I STEAR!!!!!11111oneomnsfjnskfadjksfhse\'\' you steer using left and right arrow keys and you use a and d for your airbrakes which, if combined with the steering creates a drift.BallisticNG is a great recreation of the Wipeout series. You steer a spaceship in a distant future and you compete with others for dominance over the space race champion.Online mode is to come, which im hyped for, and the singleplayer isnt bad.You can also make your own tracks, songs and shipsThe graphics are outdated, but it still goes through.Not reccomended if you are a begginer in racing games.Reccomended for racing game lovers.

								F-Zero? Is that you? Oh, it's a game that's similar and still awesome? Fine by me!In all seriousness, I love this game. It's got something that few racing games are pulling off recently, a sense of speed. BallisticNG knows how to be fast, and make you well aware that it's fast. This may lead to a higher learning curve than most racing games, but it's worth the time and frustration (I recommend using a ship with good handling at first).Though, as a bit of a gripe, and a bit of a contradiction to my original claim. Some of the courses can get a bit nuts in how unfair they are. I compared this game to F-Zero and it shows. Ridiculous speeds and unfair sharp turns. The character of this game is admirable, but I'd respect it more if the AI racers struggled as much as I did with navigating the courses at such speeds, but they act as though they always have the auto-pilot power up activated. Hey, this game is still in early access, it could happen. Would be funnier, and much more entertaining.This game is a lot of fun, and I've enjoyed playing it. I don't think there's anything that needs to be added or changed, but any addition will be welcome as long as it is relevant to the game and doesn't cause any problems.Final Mark: 4/5			",25,3,1,4,1,1,0

								WTF! Looks like a PS1 game this is blasphemy!!!!!!!!Now seriously: THIS GAME IS BEAUTIFUL! A game does not need next gen graphics to be good and BallisticNG proves it! The way the game is now is not 100% perfect but guess what this is why it's in Early Access :) Still it's pretty playable and fun to play specially when after 30 races you finally manage to do a beautiful race using perfectly those sexy air brakes and you see your ship dancing around those chicanes! ohhh dat feelling!Now this is not a game for everyone it's a tentative to ressurect the long dead hardcore futuristic combat racing genre!!! So I will copy and paste the same thing I posted in my GRIP review:****************************WARNING****************************Yeah the game is difficult but it's not a bad thing. If you like really easy games just don't get the game and 10 minutes later post a bad review making a game that some of us love get bad reputation :( I'm not a good player so follow my example and keep trying! Don't give a thumbs down cause you're a casul :)****************************WARNING****************************Oh yeah the game is free so you lose nothing go try it!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								If you have played any of the Wipeout games on playstation, then you don't need to read any reviews; you know what your opinion on this game will be.If you haven't, then it is essentially a very fast racing game. The gameplay requires you to use airbrakes carefully to take turns, but also utilize momentum to avoid crashing. To add onto this, there are weapon power-ups and speed boosts on the track.

								Well well well, it seems like those guys are making the game better fast. It already feel really nice, even if I don't like the ""glitchy"" ( made on purpose ) PS1/2 era graphics and the low res and noisy textures. Honestly this adds nothing to the game and is only present for nostalgia sake.Stuff that should be improved :- make the voice understandable, most of the time we don't know what it's saying.- tone down the ""warning, warning, warning"" message, it's annoying.- don't make every track the same width, too much wall bumping here.- add an effect/sound on boosters ( we don't see the difference between normal speed and boost )- add pickups for weapons instead of a ground texture, we can't see what we're picking up.Overall it's still better than Quantum Rush Champions anyway...

								I couldn't recomend this game at it's current state. ive always wanted to play a retro racing game and I thought I'd found it. well not quite...i only have two isuese with this game; the controls and the bugs.the controls are incredibly stiff when using a keyboard however they are slightly improved when using a controler but still not good. the bugs are just basicly you hiting a corner, glitching through it and then falling out the world yes you do respawn almost instantly but still its there. these isues could be solved quite easily and once they are i will be in love with this game because it has so much potential.so as it this game stands currently i would wait for the positive reveiws to go up and then play it.

								I've never played a WipEout game.So when I opened this up I didn't know at all what to expect. And for the first while... I was impressed. Though I always felt I was average at racing games, BaNG has proven to be a dastardly and difficult game that even my old reflexes couldn't keep up with at all. I had to start from the bottom. I had to relearn everything I thought I knew about racing. And it was fun.But as time went on, and I finally got over some minor bumps, and actually became able to beat some of the campaign missions, it started to occur to me that something very... important was missing from this game.This isn't WipEout.This may seem  like an obvious thing to say- well of COURSE it isn't WipEout, that franchise is dead. But that's not what I mean.What this is, and what it is doomed to be no matter how good it is, is a clone. A knockoff. A two-bit copy.G-Tek is the obvious parallel to FEISAR, though FEISAR's aspect of purism has been forked to Tenrai. Omnicom (could have been more subtle there) and Diavolt are obvious Auricom and Qirex expies. So on, so forth. The menu and general design of the game feels decidedly cheap, a far cry from the stylized and aesthetically pleasing work The Designer's Republic did on the old WipEout games (which were one of my main points of interest in the series, though I never got to play it), and making it feel more like it was made by people who only vaguely remember what they're copying.The music is also sub-par: Listening to the original WipEout/2097/Wip3out soundtracks I found a significantly higher variety of music styles than you'd find in this game. It's too techno. Too early 2000s. And trying WAY too hard to sound like what they thought WipEout sounded like. And after a while it gets incredibly grating. (The saving grace is you can replace it with better music, though I still haven't figured out how that works. But that should be able to augment the soundtrack, not fix it.)In general, as a pundit, I guess I could be pleased with this game. But WipEout fans shouldn't be looking here. They'll NEVER escape the fact that this is NOT WipEout and it will NEVER be WipEout and it lacks a lot of, at least to me, what made WipEout interesting.WipEout fans should go buy a PS1 already.ED: To those talking about how ""it'll get better, it's early access, blah blah blah,"" remember that these are my thoughts of the game as it stands right now. I do have the power to edit this, and as things change you might see the big red thumbs down at the top of this become a blue thumbs up.As a TL;DR : This game has excellent physics, and is easily one of the most challenging racing games I've ever played. However, it suffers problems with identity, as it still feels like a clone and thereby carries all the stigmas that a clone must carry. The music is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥too. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Listen here, big guy. No one here's a sh*tter but you.I've set multiple perfect laps on Zen as Barracuda, whom I bet is on the bottom of your ship tier list. I've been accused of hacking multiple times by players with the best TT records ever. I am better than you.There's a reason you're this mad at the game, and it really is very simple: You are a r*tard, you f*cking suck, and you are unable to adapt. Idiots like you who aren't able to use the airbrakes to take care of 90+ degree turns shouldn't be allowed to ruin other people's races. Maybe if you weren't f*cking blind, you'd be able to react accordingly to your craft approaching a wall.Sure, some things in the game need change, but everyone as laughing at you, the ultimate sh*tter, who dies preventable deaths and blames them on basic game mechanics.Go f*cking play F-Zero or some sh*t.

								As someone who likes their Future Racing titles, BallisticNG... Has a ways to go. Visually, it's trying very hard to get that Wipeout 3 look, and it mostly nails that. Similarly, the music is good, and the sounds are okay.But the track design seems not to understand how a track flows, with Chicanes next to each other in opposite directions, some very blind, very hard corners, and pit stops placed in such a way that you deliberately have to heavily brake to reach them, because they're on the exact opposite side of your racing line... On the *inside* of a sharp corner. The CPU, of course, has no problems with these, so I'm in the unenviable position of having high leaderboard placement (Definitely on the early tracks) while having finished those ""BEST TIME"" races in last position.It's still in 0.5 , of course, which means these problems can be fixed, but right now, how can I recommend it, since tracks and their design one of the core elements of a racing game?

								Apparently Wipeout has not aged well and simply does not hold up compared to other games I have played. There is a certain... excitment missing. F-Zero had crazy stuff like giant casinos, huge jumps, tracks with upside-down loops. This game has flat, narrow racetracks that are constantly slowing you down due to walls and relatively bland scenery.It has been a while since I have found a good racing game. This is not it.

								I know it's free, but after playing for a bit I could tell it just wasn't my kind of game. Little things like the tutorial displays JOYBUTTON0 etc instead of ""A"". For a game that works with a controller I would have expected better when a standard xbox 360 controller was connected. The game mechanics were rather strange to me, very different to other racing style games I've played. Finally, I just found it boring. It's not nessesarily a bad game, it just isn't what I was expecting. That's just my honest thoughts however, your millage may vary.			",131,13,8,9,28,1,12

								Well, I don't know what I expected since I didn't pay anything for this game. It's utterly broken. Gameplay consists entirely of slamming into walls and slowing to a snail's pace only to speed into the other wall. Speed is controlled with the A button which basically means you are either going to fast to stay on the course or not moving at all. The game has a frame cap slider up to 144fps, but Vsync just caps it to 60fps and turning off Vsync means crazy stuttering when you hit 144fps. Controller support is lacking (d-pad only menu navigation) which should be essential for a PSP inspired game. I wholly appreciate the aesthetic and inspiration, but it's just unplayable.

								Graphics look terribad, like 10 year olds can produce better graphics than this, but you know, terribad graphics can still be fun...Having to spend more than 10 mins trying to configure the controller however is not;Thrust set X... No problem.Drop pickup set O and thrown back to menuSquare? Thrown back to menu...Triangle? Thrown back to menu...Anything else? Thrown back to menu.Not to mention when configuring, not only can you mouse highlight an option, your controller can highlight an option too, so you can highlight 2 different options at the same time and not know which one your actually going to edit (why is this even possible?), thats assuming the game isn't being tempermental about the controller and failing to actually highlight anything at all.Also noticed randomly the game stops responding to controller input.And even then, after finally I thought the controller was setup, I pop in game, start up the thrust and start playing, then seconds later, hit the thrust again and suddenly... ""MENU""... *hits thrust, menu closes .... hits thrust again* ""SHIELD...""... there's only one option using button0 and thats thrust, how the fudge is this happening!? GAH.Too much of a headache...

								I do recommend this game and everything is exceptional, apart from the turning controls.With a keyboard, you're going to have an extremely sensitive time trying to turn and no matter how great you are with other racing games, you will oversteer a lot.The game teaches you very quickly to use 'air brakes' to do tight turns and you have two, one for each direction except the way they are programmed is that, say you have a tight turn to the left, you will use your air break and sure, it turns your harder but the momentum of you going forward just knocks you into an excessive drift slide where you crash and start bouncing off so many walls to try and gain control, your best bet is to just let go of every single button in order to slow you down enough to get back into the race, leading to falling behind.These controls have a big uniqueness to them and require a big learning curve, unless you have a joystick, then its a blast!Its free, the maps are designed decently and most importantly, its free!Play this now!

								Seems like it would be a fantastic game but sadly I cannot get it to run, at all. It is unrepentantly laggy, eXtreme G etchasketch edition. Will come back to it every so often, perhaps a patch will address why the FPS counter is afraid to go to double digits.			",305,32,8,43,21,3,32

								Easily the best 'clone' out right now. You don't need fancy graphics or mechanics to make a fun game. Single player is a bit short but you unlock more flight chassis each time you finish it. I would easily fund this. Please try it out for yourself. After all, it's free.			",205,19,5,21,12,1,4

								After playing this game for a short time, I already know I'm going to be spending hours in this game in the near future. It captures the visual style of the PS1 (even the graphical flickering) so well, and despite its primitiveness it's an art style that I'm quite fond of. There's also quite a large amount of content to play through + all the awesome stuff on the Steam Workshop which puts even more hours of possible gameplay time into this.My only cons are these:The controls were a little bit hard to get the hang of, and it kinda started out a bit quick for me, but they're very rewarding to get a hang of AND there's inbuilt controller support.The 5760x1080 display, while flawless in-game, doesn't adjust the size of the menus which makes navigating impossible over 3 screens. Not sure if there is a setting I can use to fix this.Overall, I love this game, and not only is it well worth your time, it's a free game AND it's a small download, so there is no reason to not play this. Also, shameless plug of my YouTube playthrough :P	 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The most literal interpretation of ""WipEout HD"" I've ever seen.Also, it could use more Red Bull.In all seriousness, I am so excited for this game's developement. If you're a fan of WipEout (especially on the PS1), this is an automatic download. It's free, after all! More people must know of this! Pros  (If you've played WipEout, you can skip this section, it's all here with better graphics and smoother framerates):-Great Frame rates, a potato could run this game but on max settings it still looks incredible-Fast paced, action packed gameplay-Plenty of tracks and ships already, and we're still on v6.0 and less than a year old-AWESOME COMMUNITY SUPPORT including an in-game level editor-Potential for insane amounts of content spanning 4 classic games (WipEout, WipEout 2097/XL, WipEout 3, WipEout 64) Cons :-No AG Leage (career/story/campaign) mode --- yet-A few glitches with going through walls on a couple tracks --- for now-Some textures are in low resolution like the original games (the ships) whereas others (most of the tracks minus the boost/weapon pads) are in high resolution, doesn't always look great together			",28,1,3,4,2,0,3

								Since the last time I played it there have been many, MANY improvements. There's experimental online functionality, the UI is much more comfortable and fitting to the series it succeeds, the ships while still hard to control are now only hard to control by nature. I'm loving how the project has come so far and I am glad it rose out of being quite buggy in my experience to becoming something enjoyable and fun. I would only recommend this game to those hardcore fans who can get used to the physics of the ships and such. It's extremely fast paced and has a high learning curve still, but is fun enough this time around to WANT to learn, to want to put time into perfecting your driving skill.			",37,2,5,2,9,0,0

								I have just found this little marble today, and got to run it just recently as well. I must admit. I have been looking back and forth for a good anti-gravity racing game... and this game is -just- what I wanted. It keeps it classic, graphics are not the best but the gameplay is solid. At first I was a tad confused on what to do, what powerups I had, but just five minutes, just that little amount of time was enough to find out how to play this game proper.It's amaizing, fun and simple. Feels like returning to F-Zero X yet not as crazy. The weapons and powerups you get are varied and fun to use, each one with tricks and bits to make you win. There's an autopilot powerup that last about five or so seconds, machineguns that slow down enemies, a one shot kill plasma weapon... Guys, give this game a try, it is free, yes, but it's also a great time killer.			",123,9,1,3,5,0,12

								I like it so far! It has a few bugs here and there (It's early access, what did you expect?) but overall the controls are smooth and feel satisfying, the vehicles look good enough and are all different from each other (they're not just re-skins). There are some small problems however, for instance, there is no multiplayer so far, it's in development but that could take a while, there isn't a feeling of impact when the cars crash into each other and the ui is pretty ugly so far, but it's the gameplay that matters! If you're looking for a new wipeout game to play this one just might be it, it just needs a bit more time to get there.			",243,47,4,15,24,7,25

I also loved this one.The BGM was an outstanding just like usual 20th century futuristic-racing video game but the graphics wasn't optimised well but it still didn't losing the fun I'd got from here!I'm still be patient for their original version for this one and I hope they would have done it well.

								It's a pretty solid racing game, however my main issue with it was that some of the stat changes between cars are very major. When I used one car on the first track, it was very hard to control and make my way through with all the tight turns. However, when I switched to the first car, it was a breeze. There should either be more info on the cars than ratings out of 10, or more minor stat changes. Still a great game, especially for free :)			",14,1,1,0,0,0,0

								It's a very fun game, even though I suck at it. I love it and certainly reccomend it. There are a few bugs that need to be ironed out, and I'd like to know how to make custom content (because I apparently don't know how to access it), but those are things that I found problems for ME. This game is still in Early Access, but it's certainly one of those free titles you'd be disappointed to miss if your into games like F-ZERO or WipEout (which is what this game is actually based off of)!

								I love this game, it's just great. It's one of those games that you'd find at a cinema arcade maybe in the early 2000's or earlier that would just be a ton of fun. Fast hovercraft jets with powerups and weapons as well as a great soundtrack with good track design. Do take note though that playing some of the later tracks with some of the really fast cars/jets/hovercrafts is a nightmare, crashed so much. 9/10 it's free it's incredibly fun and i can't wait for the online to launch.
