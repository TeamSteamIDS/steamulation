												I purchased this game for my son. I  read some reviews and watched the gameplay videos and figured that the game would be appropriate for a 6 year old. While the game is more than satisfactory for my son it is also hours upon hours of fun for myself. I play a lot of FPS, flight sim, and TF2. Most of these games have excellent gameplay with great graphics  and serious story lines. This game was a fun and lighthearted change of pace. I have had fun playing maps over and over finishing level accomplisments and laughing at the cartoon daredevil crashes. The graphics are fantastic cartoon graphics, the controls are easy to learn and with a control that fits his hands my son easily plays this game accomplishing levels and stringing together combos of stunts. This game belongs in the library of anyone young or old that plays games because everyone wants to have some relaxing fun occasionally. The levels are chanllenging enough to be interesting without it being too hard for a child to play or too easy for an adult to enjoy. Excellent game.			",179,33,4,16,14,3,26

												This game is a lot of fun. Think Excitebike, in terms of how it plays. Basically, you’re attempting to reach the finish line, while racking up as much points as you can, and completing as many objectives as you can. Because there’s three lanes on (almost) every track, there’s always an objective or two (or more) that you can’t get in one go, so there’s always an incentive to go back and replay the level. Perhaps I never sat down and studied the moves, but it does feel like you can just mash buttons and get a really good high score, so I don’t like that necessarily, but on the other hand, it is a good game to mess around with. The game includes a level editor that you can create your own tracks with, but I didn’t get to mess around with it too much. The one thing that I will say that’s negative about the game is that there’s a certain track that comes out of nowhere and is just down right infuriating; it took me hours and hours to beat. Still, I would recommend this game, and while I haven’t played the second game, there’s a bundle that includes Joe Danger 2 for very little extra. Something to consider.			",325,111,6,69,40,3,44

												I cannot recommend Joe Danger to the average gamer, as I can only recommend it to experts at bike games due its huge downsides:-Collecting is required for level/stage advancement, not just obtaining scores for trophies.  It'd be one thing if a ""star"" required to unlock levels were like ""collect 40 of 50 specific things"", but its more like ""collect all 50 things"" which turns this game into a tedious challenge once you reach certain stages that require stars. This stopped the game dead in its tracks for me after getting through a few percent of career and training modes.-""Full controller support"" is a lie. Lane changes either cannot be performed with a controller, or they're restricted to limited areas.  Also, multiple controllers for split screen are not supported!-Only Xbox controller controls are shown & explained in game.  Keyboard controls can only be seen and configured using the pregame launcher app.The upsides to this game might be enough for bike game experts:-Level building & steam workshop is pretty extensive.-Absurd number of unlocks and in-level collectables.-Leaderboards, ghosts, and split screen.

												Joe Danger reminds me of the NES days of Excitebike, mixed with the modern Stuntman series.  It's a simple lighthearted game that follows Joe Danger through his stuntman career with levels slowly increasing in difficulty.  At its core it's a simple game: Drive through courses gaining score by doing tricks and completing objectives.  The game throws a lot of obstacles at you however, and it can be quite a challenge completing all of the objectives without crashing and while maintaining your score multiplier.The game is a ton of fun and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Excitebike or Stuntman, or just anyone who likes a challenge.

												Joe Danger. Go in expecting nothing. And this will blow your mind.There's a little charm about Joe Danger. It's like your Excitebike in 3D with your mission based gameplay and speed and exploration in a linear progression based game. It's hilarious. It reeks off 70s to 90s and if you're from that time or you like those times, you'll love this. Joe Danger is about a retired stuntsman who wants to rejoin and get back his skills and audience. You take on the role of that guy and you bring him on the road to success. Not much of a story but this game's all about the gameplay. With tons of replayability, nooks and carrines to explore, a whole lot of missions, this game is well worth its price!			",16,7,1,1,0,0,0

												Joe Danger is a 2d platform racing / stunt game.This is really a nice game to play alone of with your friends.It's has a very basic controls to learn and so easy to pick up for gamers and non-gamers.You will have many tracks to race and stunt your way though.Every levels have his own goals like collecting start, beat the time or try to beat the high score of the stage.So the replay level on every stage is high so you will not drive to the game in 1 run.And the score board for world wide or friends only score is really a good add.This is one of the best games in his genre... and I can recommand this.I will give this game a 9/10.

												This game is like Sonic the Hedgehog and Excitebike had a kid.  It's pretty wild and fun.  Something breezy to play for a few hours without a lot of complexity.  Pick it up when it's on sale, $15 is probably a little too high.Also, the ""Training Ground"" is actually the HARDER levels, not the tutorial.  Just start with the regular Career mode first.  They didn't explain that very clearly.			",115,39,4,14,5,0,14

												This is an extremely fun game. for the cheap price, you get a lot of content, almost 100 levels I think and every one of those level has a great replay value if you want to 100% everything in the game. there's also Steam Workshop integration to make sure you will never run out of levels to play around !Twisting and turning your bike up and down while doing tricks, racing with Team Nasty, tying to beat the time limit, everything just fits in place and make the game really a thrill to play !can't recommend it enough, buy it !!!!

												I tried playing this with friends and none of us could figure out what the point of the game is. Is it a race? Sort of, but not really. There isn't much racing going on, and the racing itself isn't very interesting. Nor are the tricks or the collecting. Frankly, I just can't find the point of it. I can't tell my friends what the objective is because I just can't figure it out. I get to the end of the level and move on to the next, but I didn't do much of anything to get there and the next level doesn't give me any goals besides to get to the end.			",255,40,10,24,14,4,29

This is based on the PS3 version, BUT seriously enchanced for PC. advanced graphics settings are there.Joe Danger 1 and Joe Danger The Movie are having 2 differents campaign, ""The movie"" one is where You can play as Team Fortress 2 crew, Steve from Minecraft and have tons of unlockable characters.But at the pack price, gets both. Just 3$ more for both instead of only one.I got disapointed by Trials Gold Edition, but this one satisfied my need.No crapp DRM either, very simple to install and launch.Full XInput gamepad support, but keyboard control are very intuitive and are damm fine.
