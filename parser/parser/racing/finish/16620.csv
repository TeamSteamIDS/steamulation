												It's rare to find games that are so horrible, it just isn't even worth writing about them. Monster Trucks Nitro is one of those rare games.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												Jump. Jump. Jump.Jump.That's it. Nothing else. Hit the gas and jump.It also somehow still sufferes from lag on systems far more powerful than the recommended requriements.			",323,57,14,25,31,1,61

												I didn't really enjoy this game but my 4 year old daughter does. She likes to play it because she can finish quite a few levels by pressing down 1 button... the 'forward' button. Ok, ok, you need to use 3 more buttons and a lot more skill if you want to win a gold medal on each course but she isn't interested in gold medals. She's happy if she can drive the car to the finish line... which she can by pressing that one button.			",370,84,14,21,22,3,41

												My brother's son enjoys this game, he is 4. Several of the levels are easy to finish.IMHO it'n not a bad game, but it's not good either.For some reason it doesn't work on my Win8-64 bit PC, but works fine on Win7 and Win8-32 bit.			",114,17,15,5,13,1,21

												A very creative fun game that keeps you thinking. I loved this game and how fun it was to play. The monster trucks were awesome to play once you put in the cheat code to unlock them. I loved each level because they were all different and creative. There were times that you would fail and not understand why you failed so badly but just plain persistence and patients pays off when you beat the course record and get gold. If you want codes to help you out here are the best one's:Go to the Settings menu and enter the codes into the Unlock extra features box.DEVHOSENAUTO: Unlock Formula Monster TruckPIGGYRIDE: Unlock Pig Monster TruckYELLOWMONSTER: Unlock School BusDEVIWANTALLGOLDNOW: All Levels GOLDDEVIWANTITALLNOW: Unlock all levels I loved this game and all it had to offer, just make sure to find this one on sale because then you will get your money out of it. I have totally loved playing this game and if you liked the game Trials 2: Second Edition then you will love this one!			",3025,1130,139,313,428,33,475

												At the time of this review the price is currently £16.99 ...... whoever ramped up the price that high should be ashamed of themselves. This game is worth no more than £0.99 in sale.Shame ...Could have been up there with the Trials games.It appears like the devs have lazily ported an app version of this game to the PC.When booting the game, a config page is displayed, but selecting my resolution of 2560 x 1440 meant that all textures in the game were so garbled and messy I had no idea what was being said/displayed.I read a fix for this which says to start the game at a low res like 1024 x 768, then use the in game resolution changer (NOT the 1st config page) to set the correct resolution. But, the textures don't seem to be optimised for higher resolutions like 2560 x 1440. The clunky way of clicking through every screen resolution before hitting the right one is quite annoying ... was it really too much like hard work to add a drop down selector?!Not made for PC. Should be sold very cheap to reflect its value to the PC gamers.See screenshot for textures issue - the textures display fine at low resolutions:

												lol I played a few minutes and did a few jumps.  I thought... this is cool.  Turned it off and never turned it back on.You are just jumping but you do not actually control the trucks, you just do the set up and gas, but no turning.  So no reason to play more than 20 minutes of fun in my opinion.			",269,29,3,16,5,0,14

												Worst Piece of trash i've ever had on Steam, everything is super glitchy, colors are super bright, and i don't understand why it doesn't want to work properly even after changing so many options, the menu still super blurry (i use Windows 8 but this is the only game that can run but doesn't work properly), i don't recommend wasting time on this, even if it were free, not worth it, it's waste of space, at least i got it for free, Deleted within less than 10 minutes			",59,20,76,4,12,0,5

												Simple control... gas, brake, forward tilt, backward tilt, nitro... but really have to judge speed and landing aim well to get the best times and the gold.Good graphics.Engine sound is okay for this type of game, but could have been better.Challenging levels.Reasonalbe menus.Cute design.But considering the game is already 7 years old, I don't think it's worth $19.99... more like $4.99, or no more than $6.99.I recommend this game, but not at a highway robbery price.
