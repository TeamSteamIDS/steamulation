												-NOTE: As of September 15th, 2014, this review has been updated. Addendum at the bottom.-This game is everything a bad PC port could ever hope to be. A quick break-down:+Increased draw distance from other versions. Very nice!+No HD textures, but improved filtering on PC helps a lot.+Runs well, no more slowdown as is present in console versions-No analog support. Acceleration and steering are either on or off, even with an analog stick.-The digital steering isn't very good, either. Crazy drift is practically broken on a keyboard.-The configuration menu only saves half of the specified settings-Need to make registry modifications to get controller/resolution settings to work-Doesn't work in full screen mode, regardless-There are only 4 supported resolutions, topping out at 720p-Severe audio mixing problems -- SFX volumes are all over the place.-Original soundtrack was replaced with some REALLY UNFITTING music.-Different voice actors! Somehow even less enthused than the originals.-Sound clips for all voice actors and announcer are EXTREMELY low quality-Audio clips are now spammed like crazy. Expect to hear ""Taxi!"" until your ears bleed.-UI elements are very blatantly untouched. Extremely grainy/low-res, even at 720p.-All identifiable buildings, such as KFC, Pizza Hut, and Tower records, have been removed.So, in a game that's positively regarded for well-done arcade-style gameplay and control, a fantastic soundtrack, and a slick visual style, this port managed to achieve...well, almost one of them. The UI looks very bad, but the actual game behind it holds up fairly decently. Also, a quick search for 'Crazy Taxi PC Soundtrack Mod' will give you a way to restore the original soundtrack. The terrible audio mixing will still hamper your ability to enjoy it, though.This really isn't worth your time for anything more than a dollar or two. Pick up a dreamcast emulator and play it that way. It's a pain to configure, but at least you'll get analog steering. How SEGA thought it would be okay to release a game that revolves around weaving a taxi in and out of traffic at top speeds without any fine degree of control is beyond me.September 14th 2014 Update:I've left the original text in place to keep track of any improvements this game receives in the future. I'm actually quite pleased it was updated at all, and a few of the initial problems were fixed! Namely, the following:+The game now has an FXAA option! Not exactly the best AA, but hey.+No longer need to tweak registry settings to adjust options!+The game's configuration menu was completely replaced, and supports 1080p+ resolutions, including nonstandard ones. It now works on my 1200p monitor, and fullscreen at that!+Sound clips were normalized to all be at a reasonable volume level!+The interface has been updated, and will reflect keyboard bindings!+Keyboard controls have been reworked a bit, and are now just about playable!Combined with the fact that you can mod the original soundtrack into the game, the biggest complaints are that the analog steering/acceleration still suck (still digital input), and the crazy drift is still far too touchy with keyboard controls to actually complete any of the challenges easily. There are still minor quibbles like UI resolution, announcer/driver sound quality, the lack of branding, and so on and so forth, but none of them are nearly as game-breaking was what has been fixed. If this game continues to be updated, pretty soon that thumbs down will turn to a thumbs up. As it stands, the game doesn't control well enough to justify purchasing it. Here's to hoping for one more patch!			",436,46,5,37,17,3,28

												Anyone looking for a bit of nostalgia will be pretty dissapointed. I am not really a fan of The Offspring / Bad Religion, but their soundtrack perfectly suited this game and has sadly been removed. Not only that, but many of the real world destinations (Pizza hut & KFC) have been replaced with generic stores. TIme to dust off the old dreamcast.			",118,23,2,4,6,2,7

												+ Both the ""Arcade"" and ""Original"" cities from the console ports are included, as well as Crazy Box+ Easily runs at 60FPS no problem+ Full controller support+ All the cheat codes still work (including the bike cheat)- The soundtrack was replaced with some generic music, and some of the real-world locations like KFC and the Levi's store were changed to generic store names. I realize this was probably due to licensing issues, but still a bit of a disappointment.- The game runs up to 1080p, but the 2D elements (eg menus and the in-game hud) look extremely un-optimized and pixelated. If you've ever played an N64 or PS1 game on an emulator at high resolution, it looks sort of like that.- Graphic options are pretty nonexistent, but they include some basic options like anti-aliasing and vsync.

												""Like Skyrim with taxis"" 10/10 -IGN.""Is that GTA V ?"" 11/10 -Random kid walking into my room.So, let's begin to be serious. This game is criticized by a lots of players because this is the XBox Live Arcade Version. It can be considered as Crazy Taxi 1.1. The differences that players seems to disapprove is the soundtrack that is a complete new one and the fact that the Kentuchy Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut trademarks were switched to Fried Chicken Shack and Pizza Parlor. So, here start the personal opinion, I really enjoyed that game. You're constantly having fun without raging every five seconds. The new songs list is good, the controls still really good (a way to show your arcade skills) and the new patch Sega released for all Sega Dreamcast Collection games gives you the possibility to use your own buttons and add a FXAA to your graphism. The new achievements are very easy, you can do them in a single evening if you understand the engine (If you don't you can decrease the time difficulty.) Plus, the four characters are still really cool. My personal best is Gus (ಠ‿ಠ).TL;DR : You like great american cars like a Cadiallac Eldorado 1959 or a 1949 Mercury ? You wish to ride it with arcade controls ? There you go, buddy. It's Crazy Taxi! Anyway, you like having fun and you disregard online-raging, you should try this one to take a break.→ 80/100			",17,1,2,1,2,1,0

												This game is not half as bad as people make it out to be. The smooth graphics and framerate really make this game shine. If you play on a computer that has less then the required specs, don't go for it. Game does seem to have a mind of its own going faster then the car can drive at times. Its probably the VSYNC I have disabled. Don't like the fact that it's missing it's licensed sound track that made it famous in the arcade (The Offspring) Original PC release had it's soundtrack replaced too. Licensed properties such as Foot Locker, KFC, Tower Records have all been replaced by generic names. Makes the game less notable. I would get it if it's part of a sale.			",276,99,12,30,29,4,26

												Audio:First off, there's no The Offspring/Bad Religion in this game. That alone somewhat ruins the experience for me, but there's a lot more than that for sure. Nearly all the game's sounds have been changed, and in a bad way. Many of the songs play a bit too loud in game and then a couple are too quiet. There's a near constant horn that automatically plays for some reason when you nearly hit something (I think) that is really annoying and then when you do hit something, the car makes a really loud collision noise. The voices of the people you pick up and the player are also WAY too quiet. It's nearly impossible to hear them. Video:This could be good with a patch, but is a problem as is. The config launcher doesn't actually work and you're stuck playing at 720p the whole time. Another issue with the video is it's very stuttery. There are moments when it smooths out, but for most of the game it looks really choppy for some reason.Controls:The lack of analog controls absolutely kill this game. When using a controller if you move the stick slightly, it will register it as the same input as moving the stick fully in that direction. This results in not being able to drive around with any precision at all (I guess sort of the point of the game, but still).Verdict:Go download a Dreamcast or Gamecube emulator and play the game on there.

This game doesn't have analog control implemented so playing with a controller (I use XBox360 controller) is like playing with a keyboard. If you have played it on a real Dreamcast (I did), this game will make you cry because of this and, probably, you will uninstall it after a few minutes because it is nearly unplayable.If you want to play it properly, this Steam version is the last one you should try. Even playing it in an emulator is a better option because they support analog input and have much more rumble effects.This is the second port of a Dreamcast game that I have bought and played on Steam (the other one is Jet Set Radio) and both of them are broken (in Jet Set Radio you can't load savegames if you don't modify the "".exe"" file with a Hex Editor and rumble is not implemented). I wish there was a report button to report games in order to Steam to remove them from the shop because people is paying for broken and unfinished games.It's a shame that Sega releases this low quality ports and that Steam allows them to be sold in their shop.

												Crazy Taxi is a very competent driver's ED simulation. The game enforces strict morals upon the player to abide by the rules of cab driving. The game features 4 cab drivers who are mentally challenged and the player must assist them in learning how to drive. The player is punished when he or she arrives too late to a destination, teaching punctuation and driving skills. The player is given money for crashing into cars, but this only goes to show that the love of money is the root of all evil. Truly, while the game advertises itself as a crazy romp through the eyes of a taxi driver, the game is a ton deeper, and compares to the likes of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Anarchy, Spec Operations: The Fine Line, and Do Sex: ASPCA.Buy this game for your children. It will enrich their learning experience.			",197,22,2,12,6,1,11

												Warning: Prolonged exposure to Crazy Taxi may result in risky side effects in real life, like weaving through oncoming traffic just to earn precious tips. Though Crazy Taxi limits your doses to one, three, five, or ten minute exposures at a time, it’s easy to develop a habit of hitting the replay button for one more shot at earning a class-S licenseThe goal of Crazy Taxi is to pick up passengers and drop them off at their destination, but it’s everything in-between that earns this game its fitting name. From the moment your passenger enters the cab, you’ll be off like a shot, narrowly missing other cars and taking extreme jumps to earn a little extra scratch. And by scratch, we mean money, not damage– your car is completely indestructible, so don’t worry about the paint job.As you try to beat the clock, you’ll plow through outdoor furniture and other vehicles, causing mass chaos. You can’t run over the pedestrians, though, which separates Crazy Taxi from more violent vehicular simulators like Grand Theft Auto 3 and Carmageddon. Crazy Taxi is all in good fun, but don’t expect these insane driving skills to translate harmlessly in the real world.In addition to the highly addictive main modes, you can easily spend an extra hour or two on the Crazy Box mini-missions. Nine are available to start, with seven more that can be unlocked as you play. My favorite minigame is bowling, where you have to knock down seven sets of bowling pins with your car, but i also enjoyed the obstacle courses, and a highly challenging four-minute race that doesn’t even give you a directional arrow to follow.I also appreciate the level of feedback you’ll get after completing each mission. In arcade mode, you’ll watch your rank rise from 99th place as you pick up and drop off passengers, and then you’ll receive a class license ranking. (IN THE ORIGINAL VERSION)As you drive, you’ll have a very limited musical selection. Two bands, The Offspring and Bad Religion, provide the soundtrack to the game, and you’ll hear their same few songs many, many times until you decide to play your own mp3s. While the punk songs are energetic, at least a few of them have unusual themes for a driving game, like global overpopulation (“Ten in 2010”) or the cycle of abuse (“Way Down The Line”).Whatever man play  this only when you really want to have some insane fun. I mean it. ",135,26,4,10,13,2,6

												Crazy Taxi, the game that has been released and ported over to more platform than I can count, is on Steam. Is it worth your money? Well.... Maybe, maybe not. Crazy Taxi was originally released in the arcades and later on the SEGA Dreamcast. The Dreamcast entry saw a new city added, as well as new challenge modes. This version gets all of that. But something is missing. I can't quite put my finger on it yet. Maybe I'll remember later. In Crazy Taxi you play as 1 of 4 different cab drivers, who drive around the city picking up people and dropping them off at their destination as quickily as possible. You can drive against traffic, off road, over ramps for huge air...and even underwater. It's all a little, i don't know. Crazy! The maps are unnamed but seem to resemble the types of communities you may see in places like California. Sunny, and full of hills. A lot like San Francisco. So the game has really 2 modes of play. The arcade mode, which is split into the original arcade setting of beating the clock and adding time with each successful fare, or an overall timed session where you just pick up as many passengers as possible in a set amount of time. The other mode being the crazy box, which is just a challenge mode with different challenges, like a long jump, combo scoring, timed courses, and more. It's a apretty simple package, but it works. It's not a weekend game, but its a good game to kill an hour or so of boredom. But what went wrong? Why would I possibly not recommend this title? It's simple. Something is missing. Something that made the game a blast even more so to play back in the day. The soundtrack! Yeah. Licensing ran out I guess. And the once great soundtrack was replaced. But hey, this is not a big deal right? Well, when they replace some adrenaline pumping music with.....garbage (and, no, not the band Garbage), it kind of kills the overall mood of the game for some. It did for me at least.  I don't mind replacing music, but at least replace it with something more fitting! This is like watching your favorite action sequence in a movie, with music on the scene replaced and performed by.....Avril Lavigne? Yeah. It just does not work.Lastly, I know there is a huge hatred for product placement in games. But for Crazy Taxi, the product placement just seemed to fit. And it gave the world a bit of charm. But that too like the great soundtrack, is gone. Crazy Taxi is a great game guys, don't get me wrong. But when it's done in perfection on other systems like the Dreamcast, I can not possibly give this an honest recommendation.  ",2650,995,119,316,348,31,451

Very fun game, I remember that I played it a lot on the local arcades back in the 90ties!In this game you basicasilly is a a crazy taxi driver, who pick up random customers on the streets. The game is all cartoonish and fun, you can hit other cars and its ok, you must fun fast and when you perform stunt moves like crazy jumps the customers throw out money for you. You pick up one customer after another until the time runs out.Its a simple and nostalgic arcade game, which I recommend for all the 90ties game fansI Rate 3.7/5.0 ",135,13,0,25,3,1,6

												I bought this game just to write that it's not worth buying without the original soundtrack, as well as learn what the disappointing replacement soundtrack is during the end credits. But I also learnt that the PC version of this really sucks, especially when you're playing on a keyboard. So, refund time for me.This game isn't recommended on PC, but I recommend you get it on one of the original consoles (Xbox, PS2, Dreamcast) Hell, it's available on iPad/iPhone with the original Bad Religion/Offspring soundtrack and the gameplay is much better than this.But overall,  you could say that the original soundtrack is...ALL I WAAAAANNNTTTALL I WAAAAAAANNNTTTYA YA YA YA YA!

												This is a game I grew up with and have played on almost every single platform it's been available on. That being said, sadly this is worst edition of the game I've ever played.I will give it it's pros:- Runs at a solid 60+ fps- Has original feel and game play, including all modes and crazybox- All old cheats still workThe cons:- Some of the best music from the soundtrack is gone- Sound effects changed and horrible- Continuous loud horn honking sound when around / hitting cars- NPC voice volume is far too low in contrast to other sound effects- Company names (such as KFC) have been changed to generic names- Game has large black borders in full screen, esentially making it like playing on a 4:3 ratio, can not find a fix for thisWhile I will still play the game until I beat all of it, as I always do, I will probably not play too much of it after that. If you absolutely love the game and it's a must have then get it. Otherwise it's going to be a disappointment if you expect the same experience you had on dreamcast. Mind you I also got this game in a humble bundle pack, it is no where near worth the original price of $7.99. Kills me to say it because I love this game but would tell my friends to pass on this port.			",86,11,3,12,10,1,10

												Gameplay-wise this is the Crazy Taxi you remember from Dreamcast.  However, one of the best aspects of the original was the Offspring and Bad Religion soundtrack...which is unfortunately not present.  This would be a game changer but luckily with some file conversion, you can replace the current soundtrack with whatever you want.  They give you 14 tracks so what I did was put the original Offspring and Bad Religion tracks back and added a few others of my own personal preference.  Doing this definitely brings the Crazy Taxi spark back!			",62,4,0,16,1,1,2

												The fact that they removed the original sountrack and the brand name destinations takes away some of the charm of the original dreamcast release. Even so, I'm still enjoying replaying this game.  Still prefer this stripped version over playing it with an emulator.			",327,78,17,34,33,3,36

												This has always been a fun game and I looked forward to playing a classic on PC.  Pick up tricky customers against the clock and race across the city to deposit them (on time) and collect their fare, then race off for the next.  Collect as much money as you can and try to earn your Class A license.Great - except, on PC, forget it.  :(There are inexplicable lags and frame-dropouts.  The game will have momentary freezes throughout.  I should mention that I have an overclocked i7-4930K (12 logical cores), 6Gb Titan Black and 16Gb DDR but the performance is as reported in the forums - strangely poor).  It doesn't make a lot of sense.  However, this would be tolerable if it wasn't for the wrecked controls...Sega have mapped the controller to digital keys for this (bad) PC port.  There is no analogue control via gamepad, so touching the control stick lurches the car sharply full left or right (no gradual or easy turns), making it impossible to weave through traffic.  There is NO gain in using a gamepad for this game whatsoever, and on/off digital controls merely give full 90-degree turn or no turn.  Horrible.It's a shame because this game has always been one of those entertaining lightweight games that was pretty flawless on console, but there is no joy to be found in this PC port.  Avoid if you have the game on any other format (console and Android versions are much better).			",238,117,21,21,132,3,67

An Insane Taxi Driving Arcade Game


YouTube™ Video: Crazy Taxi || Insane Taxi Driving Arcade Game

+ The gameplay is so much fun. You drive around pickiing up passengers and taking them to their destination as fast as possible to earn cash and to extend the clock. At the same time to earn tips you need to drive close to other vehicles, drift, and perform high flying jumps along the way.+ The cars handling and physics are completely ridiculous but in a good way as they let you perform death defying sharp terms, ram other cars off the road, and slam into walls without worry. + Lots of shortcuts. With practice you will learn the best routes and inevetibly reach higher scores.+ Various minigame challenges ""Crazy Box""  which will help improve your skills and are also quite fun+ Great soundtrack+ This game is about 17 years old, and is still an absolute joy to play. I feel like those of you like me who grew up during the 90's / early 2000's will get a good nostalgia rush playing this again. - Learning how to Boost and Drift is quite difficult and requires some pretty precise timed button inputs. Without learning how to do these the game will feel overly challenging at times which can be a bit frustrating.			",2898,1025,99,264,346,21,391

												No Offspring soundtrack, controls are digital meaning no precise turning or accel/brake which is REALLY detrimental to gameplay, widescreen is stretched rather than scaled, almost all those real life brand name shops have been replaced with generic things - buy the DC, PS2 or GameCube version instead.Apparently there are unofficial fan patches to fix the inputs and the music, but I think I'll stick to the other versions.

												I loved this game on Dreamcast and still have it somewhere.But please DON'T buy this game on pc: it is unplayable.Since the controls are digital only (no analog, even with a 360 pad), steering is horrible. The smallest change of direction becomes a challenging slalom to even stay on the road.One word: UNPLAYABLE ...I'm sure I remember that this wasn't the case on Dreamcast. I'm sure it was analog back then. In anycase, it was fun in the days and now isn't anymore.Also note that the soundtrack isn't the same. It's not so bad, but far from as good as the old one.If you liked the old Crazy Taxi, don't ruin your sweet memories with this version.If you are curious to try it, go grab it on Dreamcast.

												If you played this game on the Dreamcast and you bought this version from Steam for nostalgic reasons prepare to be sort of disappointed. This game isn't bad don't get me wrong but it lost the original content it had from the Dreamcast version. Unfortunately the look and sounds of the game have been changed. The music is totally different, most of the music on this version have songs from some unknown forgettable indie and rock bands. So no music from The Offspring or Bad Religion the licenses for those songs are not available anymore. Also most of the buildings you take the people to are not famous places in real life like KFC or even Tower Records. They all been changed probably for copyright reasons or that some of the stores don't exist anymore. Other than that the gameplay is roughly the same more or less. If you want to play this game because you never played it on the Dreamcast your fine. But for those who want to buy this game to go back to memory lane take a detour and just play the other Sega titles available for Steam like NiGHTS Into Dreams or Jet Set Radio.			",22,2,1,0,1,1,0

												Crazy Tax is a 100% Arcade Racing game.The goals is to pick up so many customers if possible and bring them to a location.It's basic fun and sometime very frustrating.You have 3 types of customers .... easy, medium as hard.And every kind of customer has his own bonus (extra time).Controls are very weird and it needs to get used to.Its a old and reto game from the Sega Dreamcast era.Only there is no depth in this game and I get quickly bored.Play many rounds and geting better is the way to play this game.It's a good game, funny characters, good music.I give it a 6/10 score.

												HEY HEY, YOU RADSTERS: IT'S CRAZY TAXI! I Have Always Loved This Game, And Frankly I Still Love It. It's So 90s That It Deserves To Be In A Museam; It Give You A Tubular Refresher Of The Time That Was. As Much As I Love This Game, However, This Port Lost Some Of The Soul. Places Like KFC And The Levi Store Were Replaced With Generics Stores, And Bad Religion And The Offspring Is Not Blasting In My Ears: My Favorite Part Was Always Being Greeted By ""All I Want"", With The Iconic ""YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEEAH!"".  I Do Really Miss It, Because While It May Have Been Product Placement, It Made This City Feel More Real, Like It Wasn't Just A Crazy Perversion Of San Fransico, But Like A Real And Crazy Coast City. Regardless, If You Loved The Original, Or Just Want Some Radical Times As A Happening Taxi Driver, You Should Get This: HAVE A TUBULAR TIME!			",26,1,0,0,2,1,2

												The nostalgia bug bit me when I saw Crazy Taxi was on Steam and I had to get it. This game was my childhood.It's still the original Dreamcast game that I knew and loved in most ways, but there was one JARRING change that I couldn't overlook. What happened to the original soundtrack?! The soundtrack made this game and now it's been replaced with some other songs that don't seem the same! And a few of the locations were renamed, but that isn't quite so jarring as the fact that THE ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK IS NO LONGER THERE.Despite that, the game still plays well and is definitely best played with a controller. The graphics may be dated but hey, that was what it was like for the time. (But I wouldn't say no to a more polished rerelease that keeps the crazy feel).While I will recommend this version, the original version on the Dreamcast is the one I recommend more, if only because the original soundtrack was what really made this game for me. Or you could buy the songs used/find them on Spotify or Youtube and play them in the background!			",86,17,0,11,12,0,6

												SEGA'S Crazy Taxi  was last revived five years ago, for its 30th anniversary, but any occasion to return it to the big screen is fine. There is, perhaps, little or nothing left to say, other than this is one of the fiercest depictions of insomnia in the Steam library.Robert De Niro's Travis Bickle is a Vietnam vet apparently unable to sleep, who drives his yellow cab endlessly through the infernal darkness of New York by night, haunted and obsessed by the squalor, possessed of an ambiguous need to cleanse, to redeem or to destroy. Bernard Herrmann's score is unforgettable and so is Paul Schrader's screenplay. I like to think that Travis's famous line about a real rain coming to wash all the scum off the streets was inspired by Gerald Kersh's 1938 novel Night and the City, the basis of the 1950 London noir by Jules Dassin, in which ""the heavy rain shot down at an angle, as if it meant once and for all to wash away all the vermin that swam over the feverish face of this dreary and interminable city."" One of my favourite moments is one of the game's quietest: after Travis's tense payphone conversation with Cybill Shepherd, Scorsese's camera moves enigmatically away from him and just gazes down the blank hallway, as if tactfully averting its glance. A game that stays in the bloodstream.			",187,24,2,26,11,1,25

												Great game. Loads of fun.Word of Caution:This game does not have proper analog stick or trigger support. It's all or nothing, so turning is always abrupt, etc.Also, the original soundtrack has been replaced. I like the new songs fine, but it is not the original soundtrack.Solution: Check out the community page for it and you will see mods to correct these things.Controls work great with a mod that is found on the community page.The music can be altered and there is a guide for that as well. Or just do a google search and you will find a patch or someone who can send you a link to it.The negative reviews are because of the above issues, but they can both be solved in about 5 minutes total, which is worth it. The graphics on this game are much better than the dreamcast version (just watch a video to see the difference). You can play full HD (models are low polygons but clear, not fuzzy at all). Give this game a go if you liked it on console, or you want to play one of the best repeatable play-against-your-best-score type games there are. 10/10.Advice: play the tutorials (crazy box). It really helps for getting good at the game. I went from getting $1200 in arcade to $8000 after completing them (have since gotten even more money).			",191,57,5,15,15,1,21

												It's fine, but has issues, from the minor, to the major. I thumb it up because it's fun, but there's a reason I put the bad before the good in this review:bad:* no analog support -- do not play this game with an analog stick until this is fixed, the slightest touch will move your car, and this will be a deal breaker for many people; if you're using a controller, map the d-pad for steering* changed music (but you can fix it in 5 seconds with a quick file swap and get your YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH back on)* draw distance and pop in is still just how you remember it from 15 years ago, also anything outside of the 4:3 area pops in pretty heavily (most noticable with parked cars)* all the brands are gone (so, no more driving to THE ORIGINAL LEVIS STORE or PIZZA HUT or any of that -- instead of Kentucky Fried Chicken you're driving to the Fried Chicken Shack)good:* widescreen* easy to replace the music with the original soundtrack or anything* no slowdown, unlike on DC* it's still Crazy Taxi, and lots of fun* runs perfectly fine with onboard video			",63,3,4,1,1,0,4

												This port of the game is just terrible. The audio quality sucks, the draw distance sucks, and the steering is WAAAAAY too sensitive. Not to mention the game is poorly optimized. I was getting between 60 and 12 fps the whole time which is dumb because I can play Sonic and All-stars Racing Transformed (another, way newer, Sega title) at a locked 60fps. Also, it's not even that faithful of a port because some of the stores like Pizza Hut have been replaced with things like ""Pizza Parlor"". If you don't mind going through the hassle, here's a much better way to enjoy the game on PC.Step 1: Download the Gamecube ""Dolphin"" emulator (make sure you do your research on this. I recommend ""Simply Austin's"" video tutorials about this and the Ishiiruka build)Step 2: Download the Crazy Taxi Gamecube ROM from the Emuparadise website.Step 3: Enjoy a much more playable/enjoyable version of the game that handles smoothly, runs smoothly, is at 1080p, has good audio quality, and has all of the cool places you remember in it.And to top it all off, now that you have Dolphin installed, you can now easily enjoy many other great Gamecube titles! :D			",109,11,5,5,9,2,20

												He woke up to the mornings sunlight through his window.He looked at his alarm clock “I’m going to be late!” He got up and rushed to the bathroom and brushed his teeth and brushed his light brown hair. He went back to his room and got dressed, black T-shirt and jeans. He went downstairs grabbed his backpack and skateboard and went out the door. He got on his skateboard and rode down the street. “JAY! Wait!” He turned to see Dillon right behind him his best friend. “Dude we gotta hurry we’ll be late!” Jay replied. They started going fast down the sidewalks until finally they made it James Don Middle School. “Well we made it and we still have time to talk” Jay said “Yeah so how was the weekend?” Dillon replied. “Fine just slept most of it” He said. “Happy Birthday dude” Dillon said. “Thanks, but first I have to get the worst of it out of the day. School.” He said just as the bell rang. They stated walking to their first period class together. While walking he saw Claire his crush. “Happy Birthday Jay!” she said to him. He was sort of popular. “Thanks” he continued to his class and sat down. “History” He said as the teacher walked in. “Good morning class. Today we will start our study’s on the Heros of the Sky’s, Ground, Flame, Life, and Water. These hero’s were just myth’s people once said they were saviors from hideous monsters of earth. One in particular Domintern he possessed the powers of many in strength speed and agility. A clan unknown to this day once had once gave life to him once again after being killed many years before these hero’s. But we will talk more about this later.” Class continued on and others until the end of school. Jay skated home to get ready for his Birthday. When he got home his mother and dad and two sisters  Lauren who was 15 and Lisa who was 17 were waiting and all said “Happy Birthday Jay 13 Years old!” They all stated talking then after a while they brought out the cake and sang happy birthday to him. Then after eating some cake they started on presents. While him and his sisters were talking his mom and dad went into the garage and went to go get his presents. They brought out one odd one in particular a wooden box. “Open this last.” His dad said to him. He got a tablet, new Phone and new skateboard wheels. Then came the wooden box. After setting it in front of him they both looked at each other anxiously. He lifted the lid and saw 2 black wrist bands with electric blue lightning bolts on them. He put them on. “Why such a big box for these?” he said “They will be explained soon. Now come follow me.”  He followed him into the garage and in there he uncovered a button on the wall and pressed it. An elevator rose from the ground. “We have been waiting for this day ever since you were born Jay.” They both stepped into the elevator and it went down. He saw glass and through it a big room with black squares and in between them blue lights. It stopped at the bottom and they both stepped out and immediately  four kids stood before them. “Welcome.” One said. He noticed they wore the same wristbands but all had different symbols on them. “I’m Sam I control the element ground.” He said “I’m Jake I control fire.” Jake said confidently. “I’m Lindsey I control life.” Lindsey said with loyalty. “I’m Alex water is mine.” He said with a strong voice. “These are your partners and you have an element can you guess?” His dad said. In his mind he imagined a lightning strike. “Lightning…my power is lightning.” He said. “You are Lightning Shadow” He said. “Now talk to your companions. They are your mentors” He said as he stepped into the elevator. He watched as the doors closed and watched it go up. “Jay, do you know what those are?” Lindsey said. “Wristbands?” He replied. “Their called Gauntlets they are a weapon system, they protect you.” Sam said. Jake threw him a black hoodie with a lightning bolt on the back. “Put it on” Jake said. Jay put it on. “We are going out into the field be ready and that hoodie is your temporary way around. He felt like he could do anything. He tried to do a backflip and he succeed “Whoa. This is awesome.” He said. Alex got out a button and pressed it. A car rose out of the ground. His dream car. A Camaro with electric blue stripes and a black body. “Hop in guys” Alex said. They all got in and Jay got in the driver’s seat. “Wait can’t drive. I’m only 13.” Jay said. “But the computer can.” Lindsey said. Just after she said that a hole opened in the wall and the car raced off to it. In a flash they were on the road. Heading to downtown NYC. “This city is your new playground.” Jake said. “Put up your hoods guys.” Alex said and everyone but them up. “Ejection in 1 minute” A computer voice said. “Wait what ejection!?” Jay said franticly. Just then the roof opened to the downtown of NYC. They all shot up in the air and grabbed onto a wall of an apartment building. Jay was panting heavily. “What the heck?!” Jay shouted. “Time for free running!” Sam said. Just then they all started to climb up the building. Jay was still behind. “I cant do that!” Jay shouted up to them. “We know but the hoodie helps you!” Alex shouted back. Jay started climbing up at incredible speed. He caught up with them and reached the top. They all ran across the roof and jumped onto another  building. But stopped on the roof. “Why did you guys stop?” Jay said. “Trouble.” Cmon! Lindsay said. They all started to run to the edge and looked to see a girl getting mugged by men with guns and machetes. “Oh my god! That’s Claire!” Jay said. Then he jumped off the edge and started climbing down. They all said at once “Who’s Claire?” “I’ll explain later just hurry!” Jay said. They all reached the bottom. The men looked at them. “Oh who do we have here?” A man said looking like the boss. “Get them boys.” He shouted. “Guys gauntlets now!” Sam yelled. “Here Jayerrr I mean Lightning Shadow focus on activating them. H though about it then they transformed into black steel gauntlets. “Here think about a sword!” He thought about it and a sword came out of a slit at the top of one gauntlet. “Whoaaaaa” he said in surprise. Just then the supposed leader came at them with his machete. Jay dodged and lunged out of the way. He came back with a swing and cut off his chain necklace. “Sorry sir!” he said. With his other hand he upper cutted him, making him fall to the ground. The other men backed off Claire and looked at Jay. “Ummm I got lucky?” he said. They all ran away with scared faces. Claire got up. “Who are you guys?” she said to them. “Well you may know soon we gotta go!” Sam replied. Lindsey grabbed the back of Jays hoodie and pulled him up the building. “Okay first who’s Claire?” Jake said when they all got up there. “She is sorta my crush…” Jay said clearing his throat. “Okay guys lets just get home and start training.” Alex said..

												This game makes it feel like you are at the arcade for short bursts of fun, but there are still a few mode choices to keep it interesting. I got it for nostalgia, but it still made me laugh (especially when I was still working out how to get the car out of reverse) plus the music is good like the Burnout ganes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Crazy Taxi, the game that was 15 years away of being called Taxi Simulator. I'm glad it wasn't.The first time I played this was in an arcade, although most of the time I spent there was just watching the gameplay footage since I was very bad at it and my parents wouldn't give me coins to spend in a game that wouldn't last longer than 2 minutes or so.A few years later I got the Windows version of the game since it was included in Nestlé cereals, just like Starsky and Hutch, Ford Racing 2, etc. It was a bit different but I had a great time with it, spent dozens of hours playing it.When I got the steam version I tried it out and noticed that the songs were not the same (the Windows version I played had Pivit, Too Rude and Total Chaos songs instead of Offspring and Bad Religion, those are the ones that were familiar to me) and the framerate wasn't that good so I gave up on it right away.A few days ago I thought of trying it out again and man it really felt good! Not a very good port but the frame rate issues quickly fade away with the fun of playing this. I easily got accustomed to the new songs, they're actually pretty neat.I don't like the original level that much, since I always feel lost in it but the arcade level is a blast to drive around. Not mentioning the nerve-wracking Crazy Box levels!If you're already a fan of Crazy Taxi and you don't mind listening to different songs, different voices, not having Pizza Hut, KFC and Levis featured and a few performance hiccups regardless of your rig, then get this game if you want to get back to Crazy Taxi. The achievements are also quite easy to get if you're an experienced crazy cab driver. If it's your first time playing the game then HEY HEY, COME ON OVER HAVE SOME FUN WITH CRAZY TAXI!

												I have only recently had this game for about a week on PC. So I don't have anything to say on the actual previous version before this latest update.I own this on XBLA, and have on Dreamcast as well. Obviously there were some major changes to the game for the modern HD re-release. The glaringly obvious ones would be the original Offspring soundtrack is now replaced with some generic music as well as the original voice actors have been replaced and the quality of the audio for them is low, and the KFC, Tower Records, Pizza Hut and Levis brands are no longer a part of the game.Fortunately you can mod in the original soundtrack and voice actors with higher quality files from the original PC port.If you would like to grab those before you buy this, then please do so here.Original Dreamcast Soundtrack


How to replace the music! 
A Guide for Crazy Taxi
By: mum forgot to pay internet

			This quick guide will show you how to replace the ADX files in the game, and ultimately customise the soundtrack to  your  preference.		


Original Dreamcast Voices


Adding the original Dreamcast/Arcade voices 
A Guide for Crazy Taxi
By: Stachekip

			Lets you have the original Dreamcast and arcade voices for the characters instead of the newer ones introduced in the 2001(PS2, XBox, Gamecube, PC) versions of the game.		


If you use these simply mods, it goes a long way to replicating the feel of the original Arcade/Dreamcast version of the game.In closing, I give the game a 9 out of 10, simply because you have to mod the game to make it like it should actually be. If it had all the brands I would give it a 10.			",399,60,20,27,23,5,48

												I was really fond of that game on Dreamcast/PS2 and arcade...But that port is awful and removes all the fun from the original version: - Don't expect any offspring on that one... Was removed for some music that do not fit the game - Don't expect to bring someone to KFC, all places were renamed - No way to change these awful gamepad controls (accelerate is left shoulder, brake left trigger... In what world is that a good control???) - No support of analogic control meaning you cannot control softly your car - Some game mechanics are simply broken. All crazy drifts and gearbox tricks are not doable.If you want to play the nice version of that game, skip that version and get a PS2/Dreamcast version !			",147,21,18,22,20,2,13

												Good: As a reminder that this type of game experience used to exist.Bad: Terrible controls, crippled port with licensing issues.Crazy Taxi was first released in 1999 and unsurprisingly looks & plays like a port of a 16 year old SEGA arcade game.This is to mean that it plays in quick, frantic 5-10 minute score based sessions & as such has very few options in terms of gameplay adjustment. Being a SEGA title, the usual quirkness is abundant such as bizarre, brightly coloured character design choices & it's decade long attempt at trying to be edgy & cool without being offensive. To be fair, this was the prominent popular entertainment media attitude at the time, but it dates all SEGA's output significantly.The PC port has the original soundtrack removed, location names changed (due to licensing issues) & analogue controls removed which makes it verge on unplayable. There is a analogue fix you can find in the steam forums, but even this still leaves playing with a 360 controller 'squirrely' & largely unenjoyable. For a game dependant on twitch controls to stack up combos from weaving between traffic, not having precise control on this version severely dampens the experience.Even for a SEGA game, the driving controls were far more responsive on earlier titles such as Daytona USA & SEGA Rally & as such, if you're expecting a similar level of fidelity you might be disappointed.How much you'll get from this game depends mostly on how much nostalgia you have for the original Dreamcast or Arcade release. In which case  plenty other emulations are available to give a more authentic experience.As a history lesson you can see more modern games that have been inspired from this such as the Kudos system in PGR, the traffic weaving combos in Burnout Paradise, or perhaps most annoyingly, the core taxi pickup gameplay appearing in every GTA-esque sandbox game. It's still interesting to think that this entire game would now be considered a throw-away side activity in a larger game to be ignored & shows how far video games have evolved.Is it worth the full price? Not at all. Wait for it to be in a bundle or on sale if you really want to have a nostalgia moment & remember what people were playing in 1999-2000. If you have no reverance for either the title or for SEGA's late 90s period, then avoid & pick up a more modern title for probably the same amount of money. ",136,78,2,20,19,4,28

												Some of the controls are a little weird (driving/racing games on PC always are), and this game seems unable to do true widescreen (I got 4:3 stretched to fit my 16:9 screen), but if you can get it on sale, this is a fun way to play a game that originally came out for arcades in the early 2000s, along with Sega Dreamcast and Nintendo GameCube.I remapped my controls to more closely match vehicle control in Half-Life 2 (+Episode Two) and Garry's Mod. But the most different thing even then is the reverse/drive (forward) mechanic.			",75,17,4,1,10,3,5

												I first played this game on The Sega Dreamcast. The system was lacking in the game selection department, but this game was one of my favorite games to play with friends. There isn'tmuch to the game it has a few modes but no real story type mode. You start the game by selecting from one of the few playable characters all with different cars and stats. You drive around picking up as many customers as you can before time runs out. The world you drive around in provides numerous obsticles, jumps and bonuses for getting your customer to their destinations on time and penalties for not being on time.If you scare your passenger too much they will get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and jump out causing you to lose time and money.The game is fun to play with friends but it's arcade style game play and lack of story limits its appeal over time.6.5/10			",331,69,13,35,21,6,23

That does NOT mean make a new version. q-bert already shows that, that is a fail. Just add ONLINE. Its like remaking forest gump with a black guy.			",87,35,11,5,53,1,16

												Probably the greatest game of all time. Or something.Yet the PC port is kinda busted, lacking the original soundtrack, full graphical options, and product licensing that made the original game such a perfect slice of the late 90's. It's a shame that we'll never get a perfect port of Crazy Taxi on PC, but for those who need a quick dose of retro goodness, this will do the trick. Just make sure you load up The Offspring station on Pandora before you start playing.			",608,181,18,48,45,8,63

												EDIT...Well I have to congratulate Sega for actually bothering to update this game. Whilst it is still not as much fun as the arcade and original, it is far better and much more playable than it was before.Get it at a discount and it is worth buying, if you are a fan.1/10 before update, now 6/10 from me.My original review below.Don't even think about buying this absolute piece of rubbish.I loved Crazy Taxi on Dreamcast, but this is such a terrible lazy port, you'll wonder if it even had any quailty control testing.You'll have more fun, cutting your toenails.

												This is one of my favorite games of all time. I own this on Dreamcast, PS2, PSN, XBLA and now on Steam! Of course there's no comparison to the Dreamcast and Arcade versions of this classic title, but with a few mods and some finagleing, this comes about as close to the game we know and remember without having to break out the old Dreamcast. I don't think there is any analogue support although I always use the D pad to steer (even on Dreamcast) though there may be a patch or mod to fix that. All in all, this is a great way to experience a classic game from the comfort of your PC.			",147,28,5,34,33,1,12

												This game is my freaking childhood game..I wasn't actually expecting it to be there in steam store when I first got it here, but I am so glad it does. Would be playing it for hours and hours without even being bored, so why not give it a review here? :D Here's my review of the game ~ If you're searching for a wonky, fast-paced taxi simulator then you've found yourself the perfect game! -The controls are a little annoying and wonky, but this is what makes this game fun!-the soundtracks are not the best, but they still add up to the action!-the graphics are quite old (obviously) but if you do not mind that much then it's wonderful!-The physics and mechanics are EXTREMELY wobbly and crazy-Drifting is really hard so I'd reccomend just going in a straight line as much as you can-Drivers and cars are pretty cool!-It can get a little bland and quite boring since the line of the passengers you pick (if you are going for the fastest rides of course) after playing one gamemode for too long-Not much of a gameplay other than just picking up people and giving them a ride to the place they wish to arrive at.I give it a 7/10 for all this, and for being my childhood game <3  ",149,39,3,2,5,2,4

												Well, I was slightly disappointed. If you are here anyway, you have already played Crazy Taxi or at the very least know what it is. It's still Crazy Taxi, but the game doesn't support analog support, which means that the joystick goes from nothing to ALL THE WAYYYY.  This also makes CRITICAL moves like Crazy Dash ball-bustingly hard if not impossible. So, I guess it's not really Crazy Taxi anymore. Also they removed most/all of the licensed tracks, so no more YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH(that can be modded in tho)I'm putting this under recommend, as to say go buy Crazy Taxi, but on another system. I'd not buy the steam version until they patch it. Heck, that cound be anytime, they actually patched it for the first time in 3 years back in September!Also i really want to do this:10/10 would YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH again.

												Man, this game just didn't age well. I spent hours and hours playing this on my Dreamcast and it looked great, racing at high speeds through the city, listening to the Offspring while picking up customers. But it just seems so simple now. Maybe it's because I got older, maybe because better games have been released since then. It still holds a special place in my heart though, and I'm positive there's still lots of fun to be had here, especially for newcomers.[Rating: 79/100]			",1657,631,69,221,194,16,225

												Alright, I've played this game before on the Xbox Live Arcade for a total of 22 hours. The only reason why I play it on PC now is because, 1, it came with the Humble SEGA Bundle, and 2, I foolishly deleted my XBLA save data by accident. Pros: + Great gameplay + A really nice classic feel to the game + Some of the new music is quite good+ Very funny + Extremely fun+ Great replay ability+ Great open world environment+ Graphics have a slight improvement. It could be better, but hey, what else would you expect from a Dreamcast game?Cons:- No licensed stores - No Offspring or Bad Religion in the soundtrack- The new voice acting is a bit lackluster- Very hard to play with a keyboard, controller is heavily recommendedI honestly love this game and it is definitely one of my favorites. These cons don't really ""ruin"" the game. They are just little downsides to the game (minus the keyboard part, that's a big one).  ",48,5,6,1,12,2,4

												I'm going to preface this review with an admission that I have never played Crazy Taxi before, so things like missing soundtracks don't bother me.But this game is still really bad and difficult to recommend anybody spend money on.Now don't get me wrong, I truly love driving games; I play the hell out of arcadey kart racing games, arcadey car-battle games, simulation racing games and even simulation delivery games. If you get to drive in it, I'll give it a shot.  But you know what all of those games released after, oh, 1997 have in common? Analog steering.  It was kind of a big deal, way back when, to be able to tell your little car on screen to only turn *slightly* left or *slightly* right; it revolutionized track design, allowing for much more gradual turns in circuits, and for games to just be more nuanced and fun.And for some reason Sega decided in their Arcade -> Dreamcast -> Steam port chain to break that long-standing tradition, to remove all analog steering and replace it with good old-fashioned digital! Just like it used to be back on the Genesis!Thing is, in the previous two versions of this game, analog steering WAS a thing, and the maps, challenges, difficulty... everything, really, was designed around the understanding that the player would have the ability to carefully steer their Crazy Taxi.Without that ability the entire game is simply... broken.

												Crazy Taxi was awesome on Dreamcast. Everytime I hear offspring I hear ""YAH YAH YAH YAH YAH"", wanna carjack a taxi and take some random people up to deliver them to their spot.For me it's not problem that there are no original store or even the music I could live with that, even if it breaks my heart. The system to drive forward and backwards was also bad when this game came out but you get used to it.But WTF about the controls? I tried to play this game with a 360-controller. The sensitivity of the analog stick is from ♥♥♥♥ing hell. I wasn't able to drive 100 metres without a crash. I was about every movement with this ♥♥♥♥ing stick. If an update solves the problem I dould change my mind but that's really not cool Sega. Shame on you. This is an Arcade game! SEGA= Arcade. It should be possible to play those game with a ♥♥♥♥ing analog-stick. ",872,335,46,107,146,16,125

												It's a classic game, still a bit buggy from here to there but I can't fault it for the fact that it gives me a huge nostalgic feeling inside.The achievements aren't too tricky, and once you've beaten all of the challenges and unlocked the bike, it's a hell of a good time and reward! (unless you use the cheat code to get the bike, but that's just lame)Overall if you played this game on the dreamcast, it's well worth the money, and heck if you didn't play this in the past, you missed out and should give it a try.I also feel that the controller integration is a must, I can't imagine playing this without a controller.

												You tap on the control stick slightly to the left or right to slightly turn--the game thinks you're holding the stick fully in whichever direction.There are no subtle turns to keep straight, only flying way off and overshooting everything you want. This is especially damaging to this game's playability when picking up a passenger and starting. If you hold the control stick in any direction while going from zero to fast then the car will essentially stall for two precious seconds or more causing you to fail the mode. The textures are muggy and low res, and I hear the soundtrack had all the goodness amputated, surgically replaced with generic crap. I can tolerate how it looks and how it sounds, but not being able to turn properly in a game where you drive is ARTIFICIAL DIFFICULTY			",354,69,3,28,16,2,26

The updates are certainly welcome, but they don't change the limited gameplay gameplay and the lack of the original soundtrack.I have played a lot of Crazy Taxi, and although it's fun, this version is not worth buying. This release is exactly like the arcade version, the Dreamcast version, and the numerous ports that have been released over the past ten or fifteen years. In terms of gameplay, it brings nothing new to the table. The two main game modes are Arcade Mode and Original Mode. In these modes, you pick up passengers and bring them to their destinations as quickly as possible while performing stunts along the way. From what I can tell, the only difference between the two modes is where you spawn at the beginning of the game. The gameplay is enjoyable, but it gets repetitive. Once you're bored with those, all that's left is Crazy Box, a collection of challenges. Crazy Box doesn't really add any depth to the game; once you complete it, you won't play it again.You might be tempted to buy this because of some sense of nostalgia. Unfortunately, you won't be able to drift into the parking lot of KFC while blasting All I Want. Due to licensing issues, this version of Crazy Taxi does not have the soundtrack and branding that the original did. I know that you can restore the original soundtrack by doing some modding, but I do not think that it's possible to do the same for the branding.Looking beyond the licensing issues, this is a very crappy port of the game. It cannot run at resolutions higher than 720p, and the textures still look blurry at that resolution. They definitely have not been retouched in any way, and I almost think they look worse than they do on the Dreamcast. The in-game voices are incredibly compressed and sound terrible, but they can be fixed by replacing the files with rips from the Dreamcast version. Additionally, I'm surprised that a score-oriented game does not have online leaderboards.For some bizarre reason, Sega has recently started updating the game. They added placeholder Steam achievements a couple of weeks ago, but you cannot unlock them yet. While I'm impressed that they are updating a game that is several years old, I doubt that they will make any substantial improvements.Crazy Taxi is a solid, entertaining arcade game. However, I don't think you should spend $8 on this version when you can get a way better experience at an arcade for a few quarters.			",159,16,4,11,6,0,21

												What happened to The Offspring soundtrack? This definitely sounds different from the Dreamcast version you may remember so well from the soundtrack to ""We gon' have some fun."" Also, if you're using the 360 controller it's VERY sensitive. I haven't worked out if there's a way to tone that down yet or not.			",31,6,1,1,5,0,2

												The TL;DR version of this review - I can't recommend this. You're far better off buying the original Dreamcast version (and a Dreamcast to play it on), or any port that isn't one from the recent Dreamcast Collection.As for my actual thoughts:Gameplay:Whilst the physics in this game are inherently completely nuts, the lack of analogue control whilst using a controller is rather disappointing. I can't really harp on too much here, it has remained largely unchanged.Graphics:This, I could harp on for quite a while. Disregarding the low-res textures that look like they haven't seen any updates since the original PC port of Crazy Taxi many years ago, the draw distance can be too low if you're using the Limiter Cut tecnhique to go fast, resulting in the background not loading up in time for you to drive to it and a face full of shop front not far behind. Cars occasionally pop in and out of existance for seemingly no reason other than the game saying ""I can't be bothered drawing this."" Irritatingly, the cars that pop in/out are largely random, meaning that a vehicle occasionally can phase into existance right in front of you if you're driving through a densely populated area (see: between the Station and the Baseball Stadium on the Arcade map for a good pop-in example)Music:""BOO NOT OFFSPRING AND BAD RELIGION HISS BOO"" etc,Whilst not as oddly out-of-place as the christian rock used in the old PC port, I am still not a fan of the newer music. I long to hear ""S'ALL I WAAAAANT, YA-YA-YA-YA-YA!"" as I run through trees and people to get someone to their destination one second earlier. :cInterface:With the patch that increased the maximum resolution from a paultry 720p, there has been no increase in resoultion of the UI assets. So we get a lovely blocky mess there. I could also pick a gripe with the lack of rebindability of controls whilst in the game proper - necessitating the game to be launched in a Configure Crazy Taxi mode. My main bug-bear with the lack of rebindability in-game though, is that with only one control scheme, you cannot change the control layout to Type B if you're not a fan of using the triggers for acceleratión/braking. This leads to a situatiion where you have to press LT/RT to confirm/cancel any selections within the in-game menus, shy of going back to the keyboard to operate them.Oh, and I'm not sure if it was just me (which, admittedly, it could be), but the bindings in the configure mode for 360 controllers seem to have Drive and Reverse gears mapped the wrong way round.Achievements:A small gripe, but it is possible to over-achieve in the Arcade/Original License achievements so that your run is entirely useless for the purpose of getting achievements. It also creates needless target-shooting for $5,000, $4,000, $3,000 and $2,000 on each map to get the achievements.Performance:On a GTX 780Ti and an FX-8150, the game experiences frequent framerate drops for seemingly no reason. It's madness. Absolute sodding madness. Shameful display!So yeah. I may have picked this up in the Humble Bundle and got 12/12 achievements for it, but that doesn't mean that I recommend it. Sorry Sega, but with regards to this version of Crazy Taxi, I leave you with the words of your mascot Sonic: ""That's no good~!""			",565,114,12,77,45,5,46

												I played Crazy Taxi on the Dreamcast and it was an excellent, fun and adictive game with a very deep gameplay for an otherwise simple concept. The soundtrack featured ""The Offspring"" and ""Bad Religion"", which were a really good fit to the game. It ran at mostly 60fps and was one of the games that made you glad you had a Dreamcast. This port of Crazy Taxi seems anything but a port, since it seems to be using Crytek middleware that, while keeping graphics intact, makes performance go from 60fps to 10fps, where it seems to stay most of the time, going up only in scenes with not a lot to render. The game is very fast paced and low frame rates make it hard to play the game, on top of detracting from the experience all by itself. My computer is a recent Intel Dual Core with a GTX660 and people with better machines are complaining about the same experience in the forums - no amount of reducing detail helps.To make matters much worse regarding the port, the soundtrack has also been replacing by nothing worth of note and which I'd just rather turn off.It is very hard to call this a port and is nowhere near what is expected from SEGA classic games like this one. Stay away from this. For example of good ports, try Sonic CD for PC/Android or Soul Calibur for the Xbox 360 (albeit without the great Edge Master mode).			",123,25,2,12,4,1,27

												This is one of the most funny games of Dreamcast catalog. The game is still good in this PC port. Recently, SEGA has improved the PC versión adding a usefull program for configuring some options (resolution, controller, keyboard, sound and so on). However there is a deficiency. I proved the game with my xbox 360 controller and the control isn't analog. This is important because you can't choose, for example, the degree to which you want to turn the wheel (very important if you want to play this game properly).In conclusión: it's better to play this game on a Dreamcast because this way you'll control the car properly, that is, choosing the degree you want to accelerate, to brake or to rotate the car.

Perfect for a 20-minute-session after a long day at work.Run over people, play with taxi physics that make no sense at all and reach your destination before customers angrily jump out of your cab (even if you're currently at the bottom of the ocean.)I give this 4 out of 5 derps.░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░▄▄▄▄▄▄▄░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░▄▀▀▀░░░░░░░▀▄░░░░░░░░░░░░░░▄▀░░░░░░░░░░░░▀▄░░░░░░░░░░░░▄▀░░░░░░░░░░▄▀▀▄▀▄░░░░░░░░░▄▀░░░░░░░░░░▄▀░░██▄▀▄░░░░░░░▄▀░░▄▀▀▀▄░░░░█░░░▀▀░█▀▄░░░░░░█░░█▄▄░░░█░░░▀▄░░░░░▐░█░░░░░▐▌░░█▀▀░░▄▀░░░░░▀▄▄▄▄▀░░█░░░░▐▌░░█░░░▄▀░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█░░░░▐▌░░░▀▀▀░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░▐▌░░░▐▌░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░▄░░░░░░▐▌░░░▐▌░░░░░░░░░▄░░░░░█░░░░░░▐▌░░░░█░░░░░░░░░▀█▄░░▄█░░░░░░▐▌░░░░▐▌░░░░░░░░░░▀▀▀▀░░░░░░░▐▌░░░░░█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█░░░░░░▐▌▀▄░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░▐▌░░░░░░░█░░▀░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░▀░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░			",122,34,1,16,5,1,7

												OMG Crazy Taxi, what they have done to you?!Wasn't this supposed to be a new release? So why won't run full screen? It's a release for 2011 for christ sake, it should handle my tv's resolution and i'm aware xbox 360 version does.The only reason i dared myself to buy this was because Crazy Taxi is my favorite arcade game of all time, so no, i'm not doing a bad review 'cause i don't like it or because is not my cup of tea. I played Crazy Taxi on Dreamcast, played on PC (first release and CT3), played on Xbox, played on PSP. This, well, this is far the worst version (if i can say the other versions were bad).Now the soundtrack, oh god what in the world is that??? I saw people complaining about the soundtrack so i thought it was from the first pc release, that was bad indeed, but this one is even worst!And, maybe it's just me, but crazy drift doesn't seem to work properly.I so wish i could have my money back!

												This isn't a bad game,it's just...it got a lot of problems-My biggest problem with the game are the controls,they are kinda broken and don't allow you to drift and there are 2 buttons to acelerate,one acelerates faster then the other(where is the logic of this?)-The challenge mode is impossebel with this controls-It dosen't have the original soundtrack(but there is a mod online that allows you to change it to the original one)I liked this game but untill this problems aren't fixed I'll maintain my review asnegative since sega last updated this game in 2014.

												Can everyone stop complaining about the Music and Locations being gone? SEGA couldn't do anything about it.Now onto the review.Gameplay: This is a game where you drive around and pick up people and take them to places.Typically you get an unreasonable amount of time to take them there so you've gotta break every law imaginable and get them there in time.Red pays out less but is easierGreen pays out a ton but is hardIt's a fun game but it is a bit simple. I remember it being a lot more vast but you know whatever it's still fun to play for 30 minutes every so often.8/10Music:The music is pretty good. Not Jet Set Radio level good but it fits the atmosphere. Also some songs were removed from the original for copyright reasons.7/10Graphics: They actually aren't that dated. They aren't ""OMFG IT LOOKS LIKE IMAX 3D HOLY CRAP"" or ""HD"" as you'd say but the graphics look really good for the time.8/10Controls:The controls are a bit weird and there's a ton of tricks you can pull off (I haven't exactly ""Mastered"" them but they're there). You press A and B to switch between forward and reverse. LT is breaks and RT is Accel. Left and Right to Drive. X?(forgot) brings up destination and how far you are from it and Y? honkls your horn. Not the best but playable.6/10Final Score:7.25/10 - A good game but don't expect to be playing it a lot. (Which is good as the game goes very fast.)Do I think it's worth the $10? NO. I think it's worth $5 at the max. I got the 4 games along with Nights into Dreams for $1.			",82,39,2,11,15,3,18

												Crazy Taxi is one hell of a nostalgic game for me. I recall playing it years ago on the Dreamcast and playing it recently here on Steam and at a local Dave & Busters. This game is apart of the Dreamcast COllection which was realesed on many consoles and includes Sonic Adventure DX, Space Channel 5, SEGA Bass Fising, and Crazy Taxi.This game involves you going to different people in a unnamed town, picking them up, and driving them to their destination in a short amount of time. Trust me, this game gets insanely fun. Rampaging through the city, driving your customers to their location in alomst thirty seconds his always a joy.This game also has a mode called Crazy Box, which is a set of challeneges you must complete. These challenges really test your ability and even teaches you some tricks that will help you reach that S Rank in Arcade or Original Mode.Overall, this game's content isn't much. Only really having the normal modes and Crazy Box, but once you complete everything, you will find yourself always returning to the Arcade/Orginal modes, trying to improve your score each time. Also, the IRL Companies aren't in this verison (KFC, Levi, Pizza Hut, etc.).Final Score: 9/10- ♦TomoSenpie♦			",69,4,1,8,2,2,2

												A pretty awful port.I don't have the world's best rig (far from it, I have a GT630 and an i7), but I would have expected a consistent frame rate from a game made 15 years ago. The physics haven't aged well either; one minute you'll be driving sensibly, and the next you'll be pinged off into nowhere.Because licencing deals and product placement from the original has long since expired, all the copyrighted assets have been replaced by terrible looking bland, uninspiring signs. I think this is the first time in a game where the lack of product placement has actually made it worse.Oh, but they added AA and shaders! Doesn't improve the game's overall shoddiness. The game is even less consistent. Surely someone playtesting this thought ""this game doesn't work probably"", but obviously forgot to mention it.Having said that though, if all these issues were resolved (maybe not the bland signs, as that doesn't really break the camel's back like everything else), it would probably be alright. For now, it gets 1 star.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Crazy Taxi is a timeless classic. Its novel use of fare- and stunt-based challenges in what was otherwise basically a technical showcase of a racing game for the Dreamcast inspired numerous knockoffs and created a franchise that spanned a multitude of platforms. It's become a landmark standard of arcade quality for Sega and has, since its introduction, become a mascot franchise for Sega, along with numerous others including the Sonic franchise.This port does not do it justice.There doesn't seem to be much general consensus about this port of Crazy Taxi to Steam that I can ascertain, so I mainly have only the reviews and the small number of discussion forums on the game for reference. I've seen complaints ranging from outdated/strange screen resolution options to terrible framerate issues to the outright replacement of the original soundtrack and real-world in-game locations with generic substitutes. A lack of analog support seemed commonly reported on, although it seems the latest patch from Sega about a year ago fixed this.To be fair, I've also seen a lot of positive reviews about this game! I'm personally a gaming history buff as well as a bit of a Sega fan, so this really put a lot of pressure on me to play the game and see for myself.As for my personal experience?The framerate is god-awful. I'm talking, on average, 3-5 FPS at 1080p60 in Arcade Mode, maybe 10 in Crazy Box 1-1. It's absolutely unplayable. Since I'm using a hand-built gaming PC which uses a GTX660Ti as its main GPU, this should objectively not be happening and is evidence of terrible optimization on the PC version, or maybe compatibility issues that aren't apparent. Changing resolutions does not matter; the lowest resolution available, 480p, still runs at virtually the same framerate.Of course, strangely enough, I also read reviews in which people can play it at 60fps, so I'm still going to say that given how subjective performance must be with this port, that it is not optimized to the level necessary to be playable on a wide range of hardware. I know the game's a decade-and-a-half old, but seriously. It's a PC port. Optimization is one of the most substantial and important parts of PC porting. The fact that I can run Crysis at a higher framerate than a game which probably doesn't have pixel shaders should raise alarm bells.Aside from that, the replaced music is... alright, I guess, considering I've only heard the same song over and over again and have to quit due to poor performance before it ends. It still isn't The Offspring, though. I haven't traveled far enough in the map to be able to reach Pizza Hut's former location, so I cannot confirm or deny the removal of real-world locations, but given how old the game is I'm sure licensing issues probably convinced Sega to do this. Same thing happened to Rockstar with the PC version of GTA: San Andreas recently with THEIR soundtrack.The analog support many hoped for does exist in the version I'm playing as of today, but without a decent framerate it's pretty difficult to get down a sense for how it feels.Overall, I'd not recommend this port to you. As awesome as it'd be to have Crazy Taxi alongside all the other Sega ports in the Dreamcast Collection on Steam, I can say with confidence that this is the least playable Sega game I've ever played on Steam. Do yourself a favor and buy either the original Dreamcast classic (with the Dreamcast in tow -- seriously, it's worth the cost and effort) or one of the many console ports out there.NOTE: This review subject to change depending on whether or not I can actually get Crazy Taxi on Steam running at more than 15fps consistently. Somehow I doubt this will happen any time soon if a GTX660Ti can't handle it at 640x480.			",326,33,14,28,44,5,30

												Disclaimer: I LOVE Crazi Taxi. It's one of my favorite ever games. But I can't recommend this port for several reasons.1. Although it does support my Xbox controller, it doesn't utilize the analog stick like it should. As in, I might as well be using the d-pad to play the whole game.2. No Offspring soundtrack.3. No product placements. This may sound weird, but I'm ok with the product placement in this game with things like Pizza Hut and KFC. It added a sense of realism to the game. Now, it's just buildings very clearly meant to be Pizza Hut and KFC being relabled as things like ""Pizza Place"" and ""Chicken Shack"".Maybe if it was one of those 3 things being a problem by themselves, I might be able to tolerate it. But when combined, they push it over the edge for me and makes it loose its trademark feel. If you really want to get the best Crazi Taxi on your PC, go play the Gamecube port on the Dolphin Emulator.			",127,17,2,11,16,3,12

												Crazy taxi, when originally released in 1999 was known for it's smooth gameplay, character, and attitude it brought to the screen. Unfortunately, in this PC port most of what makes crazy taxi still a unique and fun experience is quickly lost, and sometimes broken. I own a dreamcast. I've played crazy taxi for countless hours. I know this game inside and out.The lack of the original soundtrack is the least of this port's offenses. In no particular order, here are my biggest issues with this port:- Bad controls. The lack of analog steering is a disaster. The support for an Xbox 360/One controller is great, but the lack of analog steering means that your little touches to weave in and out of traffic are now hairpin lefts and rights. This makes the game, and its basic mechanics on the road unplayable. In essense, these mechanics is what makes Crazy Taxi what it is. And it's gone here.- Poor graphical optimization. Upon startup you'll have the option to tweak graphical settings from resolution, to v-sync, but that's about it. The framerate sits somewhere around 20-30, and I'm currently on a GTX 770 MSI TF-N770. Inexcusable.-Audio Issues abound. Many crash effects sound as if they're peaking in my headphones. Just very poor quality.If you're a hardcore dreamcast fan, find a dreamcast system and get a disc copy of Crazy Taxi. This isn't the game you're looking for.			",116,15,9,12,20,5,7

												TERRIBLE PORT.This is a good game, and i own and still occasionally play the Strangelight PC port i bought a decade back. It ran well on GeForce 6600 and a Pentium 4, it contained fitting music, there was nothing terribly wrong with it. I also play the Dreamcast original version, and i really think ancient that port was a success, well done. Both ran at about 50/60fps full speed pretty much throughout. The negatives of the Strangelight PC port were lack of widescreen support and lack of analog trigger support, and some gamepads will have deadzone issues in menus. but it was consistent with hardware available at the time, and it still runs great.This port however is terrible. The framerate is all over the place. regardless of resolution. Car shadows are missing randomly (lack of depth bias?), and the colour is less vibrant, i think specular highlight is too narrow, among other things. And the worst of all: CONTROL IS TERRIBLE. Even after recent patch introducing gamepad support, the analog stick is only mapped to keyboard control, making lane changing on purpose or waving between traffic nearly impossible. The keyboard support could have been done better too.The music has also been replaced, and badly. I understand that original music might have been no longer possible, but replacement music doesn't match the tempo or the mood of original. Crazy Taxi needs really fast paced music to feel right. Strangelight port also replaced music, but it fits better, more similar to original.Native widescren support in this port is OK, menu/overlay is stretched but 3D rendering is properly widescreen adjusted. I would have appreciated more effort with some overlays, but it's fine by me. But that's really the only good thing i could potentially say about this port.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game in the winter sale.I remembered when I was less than half my age now, and I was playing on the sega dreamcast. The first game I played on it was Crazy Taxi. I remember being hugely excited between the music, the incredible graphics, the fun physics, and the race against time to deliver as many people to their destination in the ever decreasing timer.These days, though, the game has aged. BADLY.The graphics don't look incredible anymore, the physics just feel clunky, and the timer is short so your runs don't last long. This game is cheap, but you likely wont get a lot of playtime out of your money.			",184,58,6,45,41,2,32

Though the mobile version is better for providing the original soundtrack, you're in better luck getting the original version of it for the best experience, as this port simply replaces the real restaurants and spots provided (such as KFC and Pizza Hut) with generic replacements.

												SEGA bent this game over the pinball table when it came time for the HD ports, make sure you don't turn kiddies because the walls have magnets in them, don't worry about speed though because your car goes at the speed of light. If you hated the soundtrack you'll love this game though because it's gone! also no more brand names because SEGA is a pennyless hobo now and can't afford them.Overall if you want Crazy Taxi play the Dreamcast version.

												Welcome to California, the sky is blue, the palm trees are tall and the jumps are high. Crazy Taxi is a race against the clock driving game where you play as one of the only liveries in a town with no police. Why do I mention this? Because you'll be the one almost sideswiping traffic for tips, drifting for tips and of course catching bodacious air for you guessed it, tips. I think its nostalgia and style that will overpower players into enjoying this brief arcade game.Its all about that quick arcade fun rather than realism. Ramming other vehicles makes no difference, they'll fly backward or flip over in comical fashion. Land in water? That's fine just keep right on driving. Nothing can stop you except buildings. Pedestrians will leap out of the way, boxes and hot dog vendors will tumble in front of you.There are several different areas rich neighborhoods, parking garage shortcuts, beaches, parks and even highways that are a mistake to turn on. The two cities feel alive with plenty of pedestrians. You'll see other vehicles, trolly cars and even passenger trains as you're driving, but none as cool as your selection of four vehicles to start with. The other motorists are abundant, and overtaking them without hitting them grants you a bigger tip when you drop off your fare. It takes far more skill to dodge than than it does to hit them.Crazy Taxi takes what used to be a typical arcade driving game where you drive on several courses from point A to point B and made the checkpoints dynamic rather than static finish lines.Instead of having a blonde in your passenger seat like Outrun, you have a variety of passengers. Funky ladies, men with pink Mohawks and even mundane passengers such as priests and people that blend in with a crowd. The cabs are all convertibles so you'll get to see how animated they get when they cheer on your insanity. Wrong lane? Yeah woo hoo! Flying over big semmi trucks? Do it!The game is beautiful with bright colors and big sounds. They have an announcer to lure you in to play, well that is if you were in an arcade. He is available in the menus saying things like ""car-ay-zy Taxi,"" ""give it another go,"" and ""maybe next time.""Rather than selecting a cab based on its stats, you see the driver. You have a green haired Axel, a big smiling B.D. Joe, a leopard print top Gena and a more typical cab driver in a Hawaiian shirt named Gus. Do they play any different? The game never lets you know, but in the challenge box, you can see their stats. No not the vehicle stats, the driver stats such as age, height, weight and blood type. Maybe its all a subtle way of saying the lightest driver is faster, the heaviest driver has the best turning and the alphabetically first blood type can drift the best..Its a game that oozes style, fun, flair and attitude over substance and depth. While Crazy Taxi is a game born in the arcade, its one of the games in Sega's Dreamcast collection on several other consoles. This version comes with the arcade city, the original city, which was unique to Dreamcast and the crazy box challenges.Even with a home version, it seems like a game better suited for the arcades. There's just not much here. The two cities might be large, but your play time isn't. You play in small chunks of time across a city, either arcade rules that grant you additional time or a flat three, five or ten minutes. Even the nine challenge boxes are over in a flash. I prefer a game to have more meat to it, but yes this is an arcade game, but its on a platform with deeper driving games and racers.In the main game, your goal is simple, pick up passengers that have an icon over their head and follow the arrow to their destination. When you get close enough, you'll see a bright green drop point that illuminates a large section of sidewalk, allowing you to drift and skid to a stop.Each passenger has a different colored icon. Green means you'll need to go a long distance and get a lot of time to do it. Orange and yellow mean less distance and less time, while red means the shortest distance and time. There is an art to stopping close to them, because you'll have to wait for them to run to your cab before they hop in. The passengers also have rings around them, but you can still stop outside the ring to activate them.When a passenger gets in, he or she will tell you their destination, which shows up as a photo. In true late 90s fashion, you get a giant arrow at the top of your screen, but there is no easy to use GPS. Part of the challenge is finding your own path and memorizing the city layouts.With a passenger in your car, you see how much their fare is. Well that's if you make it on time. If time expires, they'll jump out of your cab, but they'll do it with style. Even when they leave your cab and pay you, they do some sort of funky dismount followed with a hand slap to give you the cash. Of course they need to give you the cash to give you extra time in arcade rules. I've had a few times where they jump out of my cab, but before they give me the money and time, my time expires.As for the controls, Crazy Taxi uses a keyboard and works quite well with a 360 controller. The driving takes some getting used to, but its more realistic than other games. You have an accelerator and a brake, but you also have drive and reverse. So to drive backward, you need throw it in reverse rather than hitting the brake until you stop and the backing up. The Crazy Taxi way seems needlessly complicated, why use four buttons when all you need are two? The reverse and drive system come into play with the game's main two tricks, drifting and dashing.In the crazy box, the game gives you vague advice on how to perform both of them. Crazy drift's advice is to shift into reverse, then shift into drive, but how you really do it is hold drive and reverse while making a sharp turn. This will skid your car sideways. The crazy dash continues to elude me, because the game's advice is to let off the accelerator, shift into drive and then hit the accelerator again. I've played for two hours and if I've done the crazy dash, I haven't noticed.As for the crazy box challenges themselves, its just quick fluff to let you know there are driving tricks. You'll be racing down a ramp, then crazy dashing off of it. You'll do other things like ram twenty balloons to pop them. Use ramps to jump across gaps to deliver your passenger before time runs out.The game lets you keep profile information for up to four people, that way you already have your initials registered. There are no online leader boards, just your own personal bests.Since it has support for 360 controllers it could have made use of camera controls. There are plenty of times when I've rammed a vehicle, when going up or downhill because my own cab obscured my vision. This is one of the few driving games with no ability to change camera angles.At the end of each session, you're graded and ranked. Another pet peeve of mine is after every game, it kicks you back to the main menu rather than asking if you'd like to play again. Perhaps the developers felt you'd want to quit the game after a quick joy ride. The menu also forces you to hit D rather than enter to confirm a menu item. Well that is if you're using a keyboard. While that might be a nitpick, its difficult to find faults in such a bare bones game.With the review over, Crazy Taxi is just a quick game. On paper, it all seems fantastic. There's nothing wrong with the game, I need something more than trying to get a high score. The taxi mini game in Grand Theft Auto games are much deeper than this and I'd rather go play that instead. If you're in an arcade, this is still a gem among shallow, fun driving games.			",1122,324,51,104,96,15,167

YouTube™ Video: Hercules - DISAPPOINTED 

			Views: 5,855,921		

			Hercules reads his scipt entirely wrong (reads the word disappointed, when he was supposed to sound disappointed).		

I should have read the reviews before caving in to the nostalgia. The sountrack and some of the locations have all been replaced with VERY generic versions. I know that this has been mentioned in several reviews, but I can vouch for how disappointing it is to have such important components of a game, especially when the main reason for purchase is to re-experience something as it was.

												No analog steering means that this game isn't worth playing. What were they thinking? Playing with an analog stick controls exactly as if you were steering with a keyboard - sharp sudden turns that you have no fine control over. Absolutely awful for a racing-style game. Avoid, unless you enjoy crashing into things and failing repeatedly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game port from Dreamcast broken and unplayable as-is. The steering is WAY too sensitive to play with an analog control stick. This used to be one of my favorite games on Dreamcast, but without proper *analog* input support, just unplayable...  Dont waste your money until they fix this. I expect better QA from Sega...

												I bought this thinking it will be CT3 but then I realized it wasn't. Anyway I tryed to play this game because I did it before on the arcade machines but even with an A10-7700k, 1gb VRAM and 8gb RAM I could not pass 24 fps on this awful port. If they fix it, I'll recomend it but meanwhile stay away from it. Go and get a torrent of Crazy Taxi 3, you will have fun with that one.			",111,6,4,8,2,1,3

 Original/Joke review: My friends call me BEEP-BEEP OUT OF THE WAY @SSHOLE!!!!!!!!!! New review: Originally, I had this positively rated.  After not playing it for nearly two years, I decided to try playing it again in a casual manner....I was pretty disappointed and wondered how I got 100% on this game as a keyboard player with these horrible controls (and I'm speaking as a keyboard player).The painful aspect lies in trying to get high ranks and the completion of those nightmarish trials.  Originally, I spent 10 hours on this game.  And it's worth about that much or less of your time.PROS:+ Nice soundtrack+ Nice gameplay for the short-runCONS:- Horrible controls (Keyboard player perspective)- Limited replayability- Awful trial mode- Menu commands are not standardized (Enter = enter menu,  D = confirm)It's nice to see that it's SEGA Dreamcast-age gaming, but the horrible controls is unforgivable.  Upon realizing that in retrospect, I'm revoking my positive review in place of a negative one.  Then again, this game DID give me Carpal Tunnel 2 years ago (which I had to spend a few days to a week on wrist braces...ugh)2.5 / 10   A game that could have been programmed a LOT better.

												Had a real laugh with this game, because it's an absolute joke. First of all, these taxis are advertised as ABSOLUTELY CRAZY. This could not be more misleading. Not only is the taxi acting like every other taxi I have driven (both in other video games and real life),  but the taxis are not kooky or nuts either! And you'd THINK the drivers would be a bit insane themselves, but NO. They are just as sane as the rest of us taxi drivers. And the money. Calling the money deranged is a real laugh. There is absolutely zero difference between the pennies you make in real life and the work you do within this GAME, and is nothing more than shekels. SHEKELS! I was told the taxis would be manual transmission style too, but they are in fact AUTOMATIC transmission style. If I could, I would ask for a refund promptly as that just ruins the whole experience for me. And if that wasn't enough, I had to pay for my own gas. As a taxi driver wanting a break off from REAL taxi driving, I am sorely dissapointed with the amount of lunacy in these so called 'Craxy Taxis'. I don't know how I'm going to break the news to my goldentipped taupe parrot shiner or my blue ringed shunt fire guppy, they were looking forward to hours of me driving around in demented taxis, but I guess that's not gonna happen now. Their small tears are on YOUR hands, Sega.			",167,13,6,14,11,1,20

												Disclaimer:I did not play this game in my childhood. I got this game in a humble bundle. I review this game as a pc port available for 7,99€ in the steam store and use criteria as for any other game. Keep that in mind while reading this.Pros:- good soundtrack (read that some of the originals are missing)- good map design (really liked the cities)- the crazy box is really goodCons:- game is very short (100% < 6 hours, just special courses and two maps)- bad steering (gamepad feels like keyboard)- broken settings (nearly no customization, often the changes do not apply)- bad graphics (did not age well)- high price (still 7,99€ today for this game?!?)There may be some more points to cover, but I only played this game to reach 100%...

												If you have never played this game you have either been living under a rock during the early 2000's or you weren't even alive back then.Good game, just a heads up though, the controls for the PC might feel really weird. This is normal, its because this game is an arcade port so the gear shift button was basically just a button. Think of it more like actually driving a car or playing a game in an arcade and it makes more sense*disclaimer: i take no liability if you actually drive a car like you do in this game*			",698,201,33,86,113,11,144

												I was expecting nostalgic vibes from the game's original soundtrack but like all the branded that used to be in the original PS2 version, they've all gone and they've been replaced like the old Top Gear presenters.Though the gameplay hasn't changed a bit and it's still enjoyable as it was 10 years ago. I would reccomend you play with a controller though because the keyboard can send your car plowing into a crowd of pedestrains that still have the reaction time of Jackie Chan on a caffine rush. Also the handling of the vehicle's in this game is well... Crazy, it doesn't matter how experienced you are in this game at some point it will make you look like a complete cabbage. Easy to learn, impossible to master.If you want to enjoy the good old version of the game just turn off the game's music and load up a playlist with the old music on.Overall It's a 9/10 from me.

												When I bought Crazy Taxi for a buck on Humble Bundle as part of a Sega bundle, I had high hopes for this game, as I was thinking this was going to be a video game about the events of the 1976 classic motion picture Taxi Driver, directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Robert De Niro as the titular (LOL XD) character Travis Bickle. Travis Bickle was one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen in a movie, and that was thanks to the fantastic script by Paul Schrader, and I was looking forward to seeing more of him in what I thought was to be the expansion on the great classic film.It wasn't, but it was still ok. Would recommend getting on Emuator because no trading cards.			",230,49,12,18,18,4,21

												Ahh, the nostalgia! I had this game originally on the Sega Dreamcast and racked up so many hours playing this game. Now that it's on my computer, I can rack up even more! Although this game is incredible, there are definitely a few cons to this port. Let's make a list:Pros:It's Crazy Taxi!The game feels faster because of the faster processorThe animations are as fantastic as everEvery time you play, it seems like there is a new challenge thrown your wayCons:The controller feels stiff because they decided to not make it analog sensing. For what reason, I don't know. But this can be fixed with a mod.The soundtrack is wrong! This was the first big turnoff I noticed. Luckily, there are mods available to fix this.Overall, this is a great port, and it serves the Crazy Taxi Franchise well. Without mods, I can see how it would be a disappointment. But once these are in place, the game is fantastic. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												No, the game doesn't have the original soundtrack (or even punk music at all, for that matter)No, it doesn't have analog controller support.No, the licensed locations aren't there anymore (The Levi's Store is now just the ""Clothing Store"", etc.)But despite all that, it's still Crazy Taxi. Aside from everything above, the game is exactly as it was on the Dreamcast or GameCube or whatever system you might (or might not) have played it on earlier in your life. It's still playable (I've beaten the Crazy Box and regularly score over $20,000 in Arcade mode), the music still gets stuck in your head, and let's face it, nobody remembers Tower Records anyway.If you're looking for a fast-paced, hectic arcade game to play in your spare time, look no further.

												Classic, arcade game. Really, I remember playing the demo version of Crazy Taxi on PC. It was really fun. I don't really understand and approve of replacing music and stuff, so if you wanna feel the original, you should visit the community section or just get a console version of this game. Crazy Taxi in this state and in 2017 isn't worth this much money (almost 8 euro in EU region), but while at sale - sure, why not. It's great for short sittings, it's easy to get into and learn how to be a pro taxi driver. There are also achievements, which is something new in older games. I will probably replay it few more times and have some fun.			",1735,712,60,244,224,20,321

 Its just not the same. The music is different (Even though it was highly innapropriate to some people), the stores are different, and the controls are wonky. Fix, NOW. After modding the game, its enjoyable. I can say that I drove a black priest to Pizza Hut crashing into other cars listening to ""Live and Learn""			",143,30,1,11,17,3,18

												This version of Crazy Taxi is ... a mixed bag. On one hand, all the gameplay of the original home version of the game is intact. You can play the original arcade locale or the one made just for the home version. You can play as all four of the original drivers and play by arcade rules (where you earn bonus time with each faire) or a set amount of time. And the gameplay itself is just as fun as it always was. Playing a taxi driver dodging through traffic at top speed and performing tricks to get the most out of your tip is always fun.And then there's the bad. The arcade version of Crazy Taxi along with the ports for Dreamcast, PlayStation 2 and GameCube featured a soundtrack of songs by The Offspring and Bad Religion along with product placement in the form of locations like Pizza Hut, Levi's store and Tower Records which served as fare destinations. To this day, I still associate the song ""All I Want"" with this game. This version for the PC omits both the original soundtrack and the product placement which I feel detracts from the overall experience. And the music they got to replace The Offspring and Bad Religion's music ... quite frankly isn't that good.Granted, this is a PC game and as such the game music can be modded/restored through the use of adding/removing adx files, but it's not how this game comes. Would I recommend this game? Yes, it's still a solid game. And if you don't mind messing with adx files, it can be quite enjoyable. Would I recommend this version over the GCN version? No! Most definately not.			",511,204,20,89,71,8,100

												Well, I haven't played the original Crazy Taxi, so I can't compare the two and see the flaws in this game. I really enjoy this game, and the music is suitable for the fast-paced driving. (Though from what I've heard it's nowhere near as good as the Original Soundtrack). Also, I don't know if this is a glitch, but you can drive on/in the water, and for some reason I really enjoy that. Though I just got the game, I'm already having a great time playing it, and I won't stop until I can memorize the whole place you're driving in.			",55,10,1,5,3,2,0

												Well this game was disappointing. After hearing so much about it, for so long, I expected... morePretty much everything you do in the game is pick up passengers in your taxi and drive them to their destination, with your goal being to get as much cash from them until the time runs out, which it does very quickly. You increase the cash gained by doing some ""crazy"" stunts. And that's all there is to it. There is only one map and I got bored of it very quickly.Crazy Taxi on PC also has some horrible flaws.This game is basically unplayable with a keyboard, the car turns very quickly and there is very little precision control with a digital input method. So a controller is a must for this game if you even want to think about enjoying it.The soundtrack for the game is all generic late 90s rock and as far as I can understand from other people, there were originally some great songs present in the game, however they took out all those songs for this port. So you are stuck listening to music that was already bad in the nineties.The physics engine is basically nonexistent. Whenever you crash into another car or a wall you simply change your direction at full speed. If you encounter a low obstacle the game will pretend it isn't even there and will simply shift you a bit into the air when you go over it. You also go uphill pretty much as fast as you go downhill.I do believe that this game was great when it came out on the Dreamcast, however this port to the PC is not worth playing. 2½ / 10			",808,305,37,121,97,9,172

												This game is mostly the same game that we all fell in love with at one point or another, whether it was in the arcade, or on one of it's many different console releases. I say mostly because one of the aspects that people love the most, the soundtrack, is not the same. In this version of the game, you will no longer hear the songs that were in the original game by the Offspring or Bad Religion, which is a shame as listening to those songs make it feel a lot more like playing Crazy Taxi. However knowing how these things go, the people who re-released this game probably wanted to keep the original music, but due to liscencing agreements, they were unable to secure the rights to those songs, as well as KFC's branding (the KFC in the arcade mode is now Fried Chicken Barn or something like that). While the missing original songs are a fault, the gameplay elements are still the same as the original game, so I feel comfortable recommending this game to people who the lack of the music is not that big of a deal, or having the original songs play in the background while you play. However if having the original music with the game is a big deal to you, then I suggest that you go and find a copy for your early 2000s console of choice (I personally like the PS2 version for those who can't get a Dreamcast version and a Dreamcast).

												This version of Crazy Taxi is ... a mixed bag. On one hand, all the gameplay of the original home version of the game is intact. You can play the original arcade locale or the one made just for the home version. You can play as all four of the original drivers and play by arcade rules (where you earn bonus time with each faire) or a set amount of time. And the gameplay itself is just as fun as it always was. Playing a taxi driver dodging through traffic at top speed and performing tricks to get the most out of your tip is always fun.And then there's the bad. The arcade version of Crazy Taxi along with the ports for Dreamcast, PlayStation 2 and GameCube featured a soundtrack of songs by The Offspring and Bad Religion along with product placement in the form of locations like Pizza Hut, Levi's store and Tower Records which served as fare destinations. To this day, I still associate the song ""All I Want"" with this game. This version for the PC omits both the original soundtrack and the product placement which I feel detracts from the overall experience. And the music they got to replace The Offspring and Bad Religion's music ... quite frankly isn't that good.Granted, this is a PC game and as such the game music can be modded/restored through the use of adding/removing adx files, but it's not how this game comes. Would I recommend this game? Yes, it's still a solid game. And if you don't mind messing with adx files, it can be quite enjoyable. Would I recommend this version over the GCN version? No! Most definately not.			",511,204,20,89,71,8,100

												It's one of those old cool games that everyone knows and remembers (not really). It's still a neat game, can entertain you for quite a bit although steering is a bit, well, hard. But go out there and make some money!Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

			Thanks for peeping! Although I know I'm not the best driver when it comes to this game... Want to support me AND get cheap games? (I know that you'd only be interested in the latter, but oh well).

												When I bought Crazy Taxi for a buck on Humble Bundle as part of a Sega bundle, I had high hopes for this game, as I was thinking this was going to be a video game about the events of the 1976 classic motion picture Taxi Driver, directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Robert De Niro as the titular (LOL XD) character Travis Bickle. Travis Bickle was one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen in a movie, and that was thanks to the fantastic script by Paul Schrader, and I was looking forward to seeing more of him in what I thought was to be the expansion on the great classic film.It wasn't, but it was still ok. Would recommend getting on Emuator because no trading cards.			",230,49,12,18,18,4,21

												Crazy Taxi is awesome and fun. I don't much like the new soundtrack, but I replaced it with the original tracks, and it's been beautiful ever since. Buy this game and take that preacher guy to the church.			",132,30,2,28,10,1,41

												A pretty decent port of Crazy Taxi. Just be sure to get a controller and also to mod the game to add the REAL soundtrack in. I mean, what's Crazy Taxi without some of that ""YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH!""? Nothing. That's what it is.			",54,11,0,3,6,0,1

												This brings back all the nostalgia of first starting in the gaming community. Of course, I was like...10? Anyways, this is a great game is you take it what it's for. Don't expect amazing graphics or anything but it plays like the orginal (minus the epic music) and it's a fun play!			",42,8,0,8,9,0,8

												At this point I'm not sure if anyone isn't familiar with crazy taxi, but the steam version is a pretty accurate recreation of the original console version. It can be frustrating at times, but If you enjoy mindless tasks and dangerous driving, this could be the game for you.			",101,22,1,9,5,0,12

												There's not much to say about Crazy Taxi other than it's a classic game that's still lots of fun.  The fact that they couldn't get the original soundtrack is kind of a bummer but otherwise the gameplay is still great.			",220,53,13,23,23,5,20

												As long as you remember the PC version of Crazy Taxi doesn't have the well loved soundtrack Crazy Taxi is known for, this is still worth the buy.Buy Crazy Taxi on steam, but then go buy the classic soundtrack and run it through Steam as you play.			",86,17,1,7,2,0,4

												No, the game doesn't have the original soundtrack (or even punk music at all, for that matter)No, it doesn't have analog controller support.No, the licensed locations aren't there anymore (The Levi's Store is now just the ""Clothing Store"", etc.)But despite all that, it's still Crazy Taxi. Aside from everything above, the game is exactly as it was on the Dreamcast or GameCube or whatever system you might (or might not) have played it on earlier in your life. It's still playable (I've beaten the Crazy Box and regularly score over $20,000 in Arcade mode), the music still gets stuck in your head, and let's face it, nobody remembers Tower Records anyway.If you're looking for a fast-paced, hectic arcade game to play in your spare time, look no further.

												Not bad, but not great either. I played this back in the day on Dreamcast, and this versions is missing somethigns like product placements/resturants, and the orginal sound track.			",253,74,8,28,12,5,42
