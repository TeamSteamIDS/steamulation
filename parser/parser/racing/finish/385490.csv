												This is my THIRD update to this review on [Los] Minidrivers, so here we go.The physics are out wack, many times I've lost my front wing, and flipped over it, forcing me to restart, speaking of restarting, I can't think of a race I've not needed to restart.After a race a Spa [Eau Rouge looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥by the way] Which I won, It showed I lost, forcing me to do the race again.In the grandstands are only cardboard cutouts with flat faces, with the example here: 


The only ""Fans"" that showed up were some cardboard ones 
A Screenshot of MiniDrivers
By: ٠•● Bubbles Zest




Speaking of which, in the Minis the heads bop up and down, which should be easy to implement, At Sochi the Pit Lane is very short, it took me three laps to actually replace my front wing, and I saw the AI having the same problem, It needs to be longer.The weapons you get aren't varied from last to first, so in first you could get a energy drink [Mushroom] while in last you could get a oil [Banana] it should be the other way around to be fair and balanced.Again on the point of the AI winning if your not ahead of them after lap one, at Silverstone I was in third and for the life of me I couldn't close the gap, at all they won, so ridiculous.At Barcelona in the middle sector there is a middle bit that's red you can go through without penalty, it's overpowered and should be sealed.The ""Hot Race"" which is just a race at Sepang everyday never changes, never does the ""Achievement of the day"" it's always cross the line backwards. Such a basic idea, screwed up.Second Review Below.After buying (Los) Minidrivers again, I have seen that, indeed the creators asking for a good review for 5000 in-game currency, Which seems desperateAnyway, In the races i've seen, If a AI driver gets ahead of you, they will win, not matter what you do.The background is ALWAYS the same for EVERY track, Which is really embrassing to see. I assume (Los) Minibikers is the same,The powerups are mario-kart esque, if you'd played mario-kart EVER you'll know what they do, You need to BUY your way into the career mode, not joking, no F1 game ever, has done this, This is EA level of what the ♥♥♥♥.Simply if you enjoy (Los) Minidrivers on youtube, You may find some enjoy of this game, If not I find it hard for a casual to enjoy this at all.Previous review below.(OLD) Laggy, Unfinished, Minidrivers the game should be pulled untill the controls can be modified, Ditto for full screen. makes lag spikes less often and remove pay to win elements, I am a fan of (Los) Minidrivers on youtube, but this is garbage			",18,1,1,0,5,3,1

												3.9/10 - ""Loved by Millions of People"" - Gotta be good right?!On one of these ""mini"" game reviews I should really deduct some points since they are IDENTICAL except one is mini bikes and one is mini cars. These games both have the same power-ups, tracks, racing modes and more. For that reason alone I can't in good conscious rate this positively.This game did have a better feel than Mini Bikers I have to admit. I was able to hold the lead better and occasionally catch up to the racer ahead of me, so this added a positive element to the game... the illusion of possibly being able to win. If you buy this game though I honestly don't think you can win; you've already wasted $6 on a extremely basic, copied and low quality racing game. Sucks to be  You , Me ... US.Worth about $1 maybe, but there are so many better games you can play. Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

Not just the price is cheap, the whole game!If you want similar gameplay, try out F1 RACE STARS (on sale) or you know what?Wacky Wheels! Those are great games! But not this one!

												This game is simply bad.  It feels (and likely is) a mobile device port.   The both the keyboard and controller controls are awful.  They are touchy and imprecise causing the car to whip around even at the lowest settings.  The vehicle physics are a joke.  It feels like the car is floating on air.  There are dozens of better race games on Steam. Play one of those and avoid this one.			",714,277,35,169,105,12,181

												Severe bug caused my position in the race to change at random, then when I crossed the finish line the game froze. Also car occasionally defaulted to steering left for some reason. Encountered the game freezing bug during the tutorial first and was unable to revisit the tutorial to actually learn how to play. Save your money. Avoid this game.Update: The pposition/freeze bug appears to be linked to changing the camera view during a race. There is a decent game underneath, but too much of it requires you to purchase new cars which are very overpriced.			",11,1,1,3,4,0,0

												I got this game on my phone and I enjoyed playing it, and it's a lot better on the PC version. I've always loved this game, I really found it quite fun to play, with the speed through the corners and also the crashes. It's basically an F1 version of Mario Kart :DOnly con is when you play it in window mode, it doesn't fit the screen and so it can't be maximizedAlthough when you do tournaments you have to wait a few days before you can do them which is a shame.I haven't played online yet but it'll be great fun I think ;)Pros: Crashes, cars, racesCons: Window mode, waiting for tournaments			",0,0,5,0,0,0,0

												Yes Minidrivers...First of all this game is NOT fun!...It's starts allright but the AI is so horrible that it kills the fun in the game over time...It's just not fun when you restart the track for the 35 time because the AI is suicidal, murderous and other horrible things...This game name should have been ""Crash and Burn"" and you should be driving Monster Trucks THEN i could excuse that the AI is what it is...I've played this game about 34-35 hours now and i've come to the point where i hate this game...The developers should have put more work in the AI cause at my point of view it kills the fun of the WHOLE game.You can earn stars on the differently tracks by winning on them and then there is a championship mode...No qualifying...You start 22 EVERY time on 21 tracks...Can you imagine the carnage and destruction!?! It's incredible my Keyboard and Mouse survived it...I'm not a violent person but this mess almost made me into Charles Manson...On top of that there is 3 difficult settings in Championship mode but the only different is that the AI drives alittle faster but just as stupid as allways.The game has weapons...They are lying on the track and it's random what you pick up...Like the game they are fun in the start but they are just annoying me now.+- Decent graphic.- Decent music and funny sounds.- Fun for 30 mins.-- Fun for 30 mins.- the AI.- Weapons.My Judgment: 3/10Peace out Peeps!

												The game looks nice, and has an interesting idea, especially for a motosport fan, like I (mostly used to be) am.There are a lot of different races and each one has a small resemblance with the real F1 track it is named after (country name, of course). I really liked that.Bad thing is, although there are a lot of different tracks, they all end up looking almost the same... You don't feel like it's a different race, and unless you are an F1 junky, you won't notice the similarities with the real ones, so that is not really that big a plus...AI is pretty bad... It will do it's best to try to fu*k up both his and yours race, but this is definitely not the first game that has such an AI, so can't be mad at them for that.Interface is not very nice, it feels cluttered, I didn't like it.And then; there is handling... This is, BY FAR, the worst racing game I've ever played. And I played a lot of different racing games, including the one I made that had such a bad handling that I never wanted to show it to anyone. And this, somehow, beats that.I cannot even try to begin to explain how bad it feels to ""drive"" in this game. It is almost worth buying, just to try and see how NOT to make a driving game...I'm just kidding... Don't buy this game... It's awful.0/10			",557,190,23,78,59,10,107

												It's okay and all, but what I don't like about racing games is input lag.  This game is full of it.  You either barely turn or basically do a 180.  The mapping of the AI is horrible.  They will purposefully go out of their way to crash into you and take both you and themselves out of the game rather than just follow the track.  Also, the achievements are bugged and only take effect once you exit the game.If you could pick this up for 50 cents or so, I'd say that you could enjoy it a little bit and there is quite a bit of content, however the content is one of the same.  The gameplay eventually just turns into a grindfest to get the best car and complete over 300 races.  It just feels extremely dull and boring after a little bit.  Also, when you have more advertisements than options on your options menu, it doesn't look right.It's not a good racing game, but it isn't incredibly bad, however the input lag ruins the fun for me.2/10			",1398,568,52,112,127,16,185

												MiniDrivers is a pretty simple arcade driving game, a throwback to pre-2010 games that were coming in CD jewel cases for a low price from no-name studios that you never heard about.Gameplay is not very complicated: drive, get pickups, dodge enemy projectiles, win races. Repeat to acquire more money, upgrade your car or expand your collection. It is very much lacking by PC standards, but is pretty good for a mobile game.Only thing I really hate about this game is the sound. Music is annoying, and sound effects are atrocious. Thankfully, you can completely disable them at any moment, and listen to whatever you want outside of the game.Overall, I give it 5/10 - average score for an average game. It is an alright timekiller for listening to podcasts, and that's all I really wanted out of it.			",512,152,22,54,37,9,61

												This game is a bad attempt to revive a long dead genre of kart racing. Unfortunately, this particular game looks like a cheap kart racing game from PS1 era which is not really promising. The design is amateur - high poly kart model in a low poly environment. Handing is outdated - kart racing without powerslide will never get good. Also this game doesn't support xbox360 controller properly - seems like Ivanovich doesn't know about dead zones and the weapons button is not even assigned. Btw google warns that their website is malware, haha.			",604,148,26,66,36,11,80

												5/10 ""For fans only""Los MiniDrivers boasted itself as the craziest arcade racing game, but admittedly, I have seen more crazy games back in Playstation 2 with in fact more traditional grandprix elements than this game. Despite that, the game has several features, charms, and cutenesses that keep the fans of Adaco, the mastermind behind the original flash web video series, to enjoy themselves.MiniDrivers is, at a glance, a top-down, auto pilot racing game with superdeformed racing cars very similar to Table Top Racing and Mini Motors Racing. but the game is actually more adjustable than it appears. The options are rather simple yet effective. You can choose a different camera, steering sensitivity, and whether or not you control the pedels to fit your driving style. The control is simple and very easy, to the point it can be a hit or miss. Your car tends to have very responsive steering, so there's no real need to brake other than tricky tracks like Monaco and Japan where you'll spin like mad when overthrottling into uphill and downhill curves. especially when your car has become faster. Still, it's a decent control, and with over 20 track in over 500 events each with its own racing conditions, lap numbers, regulations, and surprisingly increasing difficulty, you can jump right into F1 with no experience, and drive for fun and challenge.The races themselves are also ""okay"" in that it stimulates the F1 feel enough to enjoy. The game is on a fair balance between realism and fantasy, and the powerups are better balanced and easier to understand than F1 Race Stars, but comparing MiniDrivers to that, the game can be very lackluster.  First of all, the graphic is very, very bad. The lack of fantasy and bright color makes this game not very eye-catcing and in fact makes the game harder to play in the depressingly dark and rainy races.  The pace of the game can also be hurting, since you start very sluggish, and build you way up slowly due to how expensive the cars and upgrades are despite you having multiple ways to gain coins. The tracks can also become boring and repetitive after a while. which doesn't help in that there's variety in music at all except the flash series's main theme jingle, which is downright disappointing for this type of racing game. In most arcade racing games, each track tends to have its unique personality, in MiniDrivers, every track feels almost the same.On the track, the powerup can be very helpful or annoying. In your hands, you can upgrades several weapons like boomerang, oil, Safety Car barrier, turbo boost, and streamroller boost to make it very effective to your races. In the hands of AIs, however, the race can be disasterious as they suddenly use them to annoy you, then crash themselves into you like idiots. Speaking of AI, they can be very frustrating. The opponents tend to run a racing line, yet go mad into corners, resulting them crashing into barriers, each other and, worst of all, into you and ruin your race. On the other hand, there's no rubberband, so AI will be left in the dust when you have an overpowered car, something which can be good or bad depend on your preference.Despite the gameplay problems, the selling point of this game is a fanservice, and they nail it correctly with the fanservice. Fans of the flash series will not be disappoint with the adorable sounds that the drivers make, and while there's only one real theme, it's catchy and enjoyable for fans. The delivery of the game is also superb, as it cutely parody all the inside F1 jokes and drivers' personalities in the ways you feel heartwarming and not offended at all. The selection of F1 cars are also very incredible. Included in the game are larger number of racers from the iOS game, mockoff F1 cars way back from the 50s to the 2000s as well as classic tracks and constantly updated car skins, tracks, and events. The problem, however, is that not everything is nice and dandy. For whatever reason, the game couldn't license the fictional catchy names like ""Mini Rosso"" or ""Minicedes"" like they used to do, and the beautiful stickers have been replaced with child's doddles. Buying a car is also rather difficult because the showroom constantly changes the selection and the cars are all very expensive despite that they're really just skin swaps with slightly different performances: a Manor can easily win against a Mercedes when fully upgraded.""Craziest races"" are far from what MiniDrivers convey. The game is disappointingly lacking in graphic and sounds. Other than fanservice, there's not really anything new to add to the likes of tabletop racers, and the game simply isn't cute enough like its competitors. The gameplay, however, is rather decent and flexible, the fanservice and the delivery are very appealing, and it's in fact a rather cheap game. If you're F1 or Los MiniDrivers fan, this game should be enough to entertain you. If you're not either, then consider looking for something else.			",32,20,16,15,2,0,0
