												TLDR: half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥cash-in with no redeeming qualities, 1/10, do not buy, Codemasters should be ashamed.I really don't understand how Codemasters managed to screw this one up.Sure, they definitely indulge in milking old franchises (Worms, anyone?), but this game claims to be ""based"" on Colin McRae Rally 2.0. CMR 2 was/is an AMAZING game, a benchmark for rally games at its time that has aged exceptionally well. How hard could it possibly be? Take that game, port it to a modern engine, maybe nix a car or two and replace decals if you can't get hold of the same licensing deals, and you've got a great game, done!But no...This game manages to be so basic, so stripped down, that it barely even qualifies as a racing game, let alone something that should be mentioned in the same breath as CMR 2.Cars: CMR 2 had over 20 different cars. This game has 4. Yes, four.Courses: CMR 2 had 8 countries/courses. This game has 3. Yes, three... To make things worse, the Australia and Greece courses are basically the same gravel track. The Corsica Course is 100% tarmac. That's it. All races are in daylight, no rain. Compare that to CMR 2, where you had rain stages, night stages, snow courses, mud courses, hardpack and loose gravel courses, etc...Controls/physics: Pretty much any jump will send you into a barrel roll. There's a glitch that appears pretty often where while climbing, the car will suddenly ""snag"" onto the track like it's a piece of fabric, and lose all momentum. Wonder how many hours has been put into playtesting...More problems:- The cockpit view. MY GOD. You'll have to see this one for yourself... I'm dead serious, the Sega Daytona USA arcade machines had more detailed cockpit graphics! CMR 2 for PC came out in 2000 and it had a fully detailed cockpit for each car, what the hell happened here?- If you look at actual PC (not console) screenshots of CMR 2, this game does not look better in any regard, it actually looks worse... much worse. Much worse than a game from 2000...- Absolutely no pre-race tuning, which was a major part of CMR 2 and was pretty much obligatory to get good times at courses. But I guess it wouldn't be neccessary in a game like this anyway, where the courses are as varied as peas in a can.- At this point mentioning the lack of replays, additional game modes etc is pointless. This game would still be a steaming turd, with or without more content.Multiplayer: nope.Controller support: if you have anything more exotic than a 360 pad, you're out of luck as there are no remapping options.Please, DON'T repeat my mistake and buy this.

												It's not the same.This game is some sort of horrible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of one of the all-time great rally games, and a decimated, simplified for idiots, version for iphones. Why they couldn't just release the original is beyond me.The old menu is gone, instead you have the standard iphone menus, which are all the same. There is no way to choose your tires, or set suspension firmness or any of that, you wouldn't want to waste time on that would you?!, you want to click, and click and play! Because you're a dumbass who plays on iphones. Repairing your car is also a farce. And on top, to add the final touch, they've decided to throw out loads of stages. Why not?! Who wants to rally in the UK, or Sweden, or New Zealand anway? You also have less cars to choose from, just in case too many cars confuses you.It's still more rally than Dirt 2, 3 and Showdown though.			",4050,1573,184,467,683,63,676

												CMR 2.0 was one of my favourite games, that's why I decided to buy this 'renewed version' now.I don't know what happened, but this is not the same game anymore. The feel of speed is non existent, menus suck and are unresponsive, loader refuses to remember my graphical settings, so I have to set them every time I run the damn game... The game itself has it's own problems. Physics giving up shockingly often (the silliest example - I jumped really high in the air and when I landed my car stopped on the ground like it hit a concrete wall), cars feel like wagons filled with coal, fixing your car between stages is dumbed down beyond belief to please the average Joe consumer from America...3/10, for nostalgia sake :/			",118,29,0,4,6,0,10

												I don't often post reviews here but I thought I better with this one.This is NOT the original game, it is a cheap iOS and Android port that is missing half the features of the original game. There are missing stages, cars, replays, multiplayer, car setup, championship, missing menus, and they somehow removed cockpit cam from the game and put something that resembles a cockpit.The championships are non existant and the championship you play depends on difficulty, with only Australia, Greece and Corsica to choose from. They've removed Finland, New Zealand and UK/Wales.They have the original CMR 2.0 on PC already running on DX6-ish, why is it so much of a task for them to update to DX11 or lower and improve the textures/resolution? You're better off fishing the original out the cupboard or wherever and playing that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												tl;dr: THIS IS NOT A REMASTER OF THE ORIGINAL PC VERSION. THIS IS A PORT OF A MOBILE GAME. DO NOT BUY!so, the game sucks in almost every aspect, here's why:Graphic: probably the only good thing in this game. the nostalgia feeling is there, the game looks really like the old one, althought it has been rewritten in Unity. It uses most of the original assets and adds some realtime shadows, motion blur and sligthly better car modelsSound: awful. the car's sound is flat and boring. co-pilot voice has just few lines and also has bad timing causing them to be played too late or overlap each otherTracks: 6 rallies in 3 countries (Australia, Greece, France) spanning over 12 stages each (althought some of them are reversed). the tracks come from from the original game (so they're good) but they have been slightly modified to adapt to a mobile game: moslty, the road has been widen, but also, all the surface react the same way, there's no difference between tarmac and grass.Cars: only 4 cars. Ford Focus, Subaru Impreza '99, Lancer Evolution VI, Lancia Delta. the first tree handle the same way, while the fourth outperform each of the other in every way speed, accelleration and handling (which is completly unrealistic)Controls: bad. since is a mobile port, the game is not designed to take analogic input, so wether you're using a keyboard or a gamepad the experience is the same. the game also supports steering wheels, mine didn't work and i found complains on the forum that the steering feels digital even with the wheel. it's also very difficult to assign buttons.Physics: bad, very bad. you can clearly feel that the game was designed for mobile devices, the handling is very simple and braking is un-necessary. impacts are broken wheter you impact perpendicularly or just scracth something the result is the same: the car stops. it also happens to crash into invisible walls in the middle of the track or your car start to bounce around for no reason (especially the Stratos)Damage: broken. the car get damage even if you drive safely and slowly on a tarmac road. I would not be surpirsed if in the mobile version you have to wait for the car to get repaired or pay to repair it.Game modes: you can race on a single stage, a whole rally or a championship. the career is made of various championship, the first 6 just made of the 6 available rallies, the others mix the rallies in various ways but not the stages, so you'll have to do the same stages in the same order over and over again. the original game was similar but with different car classes and over 12 countries.AI: one of the worst example of the rubber-band effect ever seen in a game, and it's also way too easy completly lacking any challenge.this game it's a scam, they tried to make money on the nostalgia of the players with a very bad port of a very bad mobile game. AVOID even if it's free			",180,31,41,17,35,2,36

												(Traducción al español abajo) How to drown a good game into disgrace.Having the original Colin McRae Rally 2.0 since it came out, all I expected was to be able to play it fully in my actual machine without learning rocket science. Well, I have to recognize that has been achieved. You can play it... at least the parts you can...Megabazillion tracks... errr nope: The original game brings us 9 countries, (Kenia, Finland, UK, Sweden, Australia, Japan, Corsica, Greece and Italy) each with twelve stages. This rip only brings Australia, Corsica and Italy. By now, The game duration's been cut to a third.Megabazillion rally cars... errr neither: The original game places us behind the wheel of 24 rally cars, counting WRC, B group and various paint schemes. Here there are ONLY FOUR STINKY CARS. Content reduced to a fifth.Then, the controls. I'll agree Colin McRae wasn't the most realistic rally game in history (we have RBR for that), but at least you can figure out what is driving a WRC. Here, the controls are almost random. The car cuts gas in the middle of a straight without any reason at all, and the turns are divided into two: you did it or you didn't (There's no way to negotiate a drift)... Basically, I found out that I can't drive the car as I want (as in the original), but instead I have to learn how the game wants me to drive it.And then, the graphics... well, even worse than the original (the internal view is worth a shot, don't miss it), plus the scenary has been cut to a size that looks more like you're playing Gran Turismo 1.In a nutshell, don't set your hopes any high: It's an awful port, ripped everywhere, and almost unplayable.(Traducción al español) Como desgraciar un buen juego:Teniendo el Colin McRae Rally 2.0 original de la época, lo que esperaba era poder jugarlo completo en el PC que tengo ahora sin tener que andar haciendo experimentos. Bueno, hay que reconocer que eso si se ha logrado, Jugarse, se puede jugar. Lo que se puede jugar...Pistas a go-go... pues nó: El juego original nos permitía correr por Kenia, Finlandia, UK, Suecia, Australia, Japón, Corcega, Grecia e italia. Este rip no trae mas que Australia, Corcega y Grecia. De momento, la duración del juego se ha reducido una tercera parte. Coches de rally a go-go... pues tampoco: El juego original nos pone a los mandos de 24 coches, entre WRC, Grupo B y esquemas de pintura variados. Aquí no hay mas que CUATRO APESTOSOS COCHES. El contenido se reduce a una quinta parte.Luego ya está la cosa de los controles. De acuerdo que Colin McRae no era el juego de rallies mas realista de la historia (para eso está el RBR), pero por lo menos te podías hacer una idea. Aquí los controles son prácticamente aleatorios. El coche deja de acelerar de forma incomprensible en medio de una recta, los giros son una de dos: o entras o no entras (no hay posibilidad de negociar un derrape)... En resumen: me he encontrado con que, en lugar de conducir como yo quiero, tengo que aprender a conducir como el juego quiere.Y los gráficos... pues muy justitos. Comparados con el original son incluso peores (la vista interna del coche es digna de ver), y encima han restado profundidad al escenario de una manera que parece que estés jugando en gran turismo 1.En resumidas cuentas, no te hagas ilusiones: Es un port horroroso, recortado por todas partes, y prácticamente injugable.

												Colin McRae RallyYou hear that name and instantly awesome true Rally experiences come to mind. Harsh terrain, realistic and believable damage to your car as you make stupid mistakes, and a fairly competitive AI that makes it a nice challenge all-in-all.That isn't this game. This game is a mobile port. It isn't (at all) what it tries to advertise itself as. Handling is simplified, damage is merely cosmetic at best, the terrain looks horrible. Remastered is a term many low-resolution games use these days to try and bring these experiences to the modern PC, but Colin McRae Rally doesn't manage to do any of it.It lacks features that previous games in the series. You can't customize your car's behavior before a stage. Repairs are fairly unneeded as they don't impact gameplay, and fixing the ""engine"" costs the same amount of time as fixing the ""suspension"" or ""wheels"".There isn't much else to say. This game was trading on good memories of the Colin McRae series and it's just a cash grab. It's lame, it doesn't feel like a rally game, and overall it's a perfect example of what is happening to Steam's storefront where publishers and developers have no shame about what they try to do with their advertising.

What a ripoff! I thought that I was buying remastered CMR as trailer told me. But it was just a dream - a hoax. There are couple of elements from original CMR, for example Nicky Grist and couple of cars. Graphics are better than back in the days, and car handling seems gotten better. But where are all the tracks? Sweden, Finland etc..? Just single player without split-screen, that's huge disappointment and takes half of the fun away! Now we got achievements, three maps and four cars. No real championship, just tournaments. That is a ripoff, and shame to original series. I understand that this is just ported from mobile version to PC, but if I could get my money back, I would take that.  Colin McRae will be kicking in the grave when he hears about this piece of skit.  ",62,1,8,1,9,3,3

												Its pretty meh. Feels like I was playing a water down smartphone version of dirt on a pc . For the most part the tracks are all pretty simple and not very fun. IF you saw the trailer, they pretty much showcased all the cool or fun corners, the other 97% is just long boring straights that veer to the left or right. Driving in its self was pretty uneventfull and unfulfilling. Mariokart 64 was better driving game then this. Only a handfull of cars, very barren environments with the occasional weird stick tree or shrub. It was pretty boring to play. Save your money and buy DiRT on the next steam sale.

""HIT THE DIRT IN COLIN MCRAE RALLY - THE CLASSIC OFF-ROAD RACING EXPERIENCE.""Oh man, what a lie again. There's really not that much games that'll recieve red thumb down from me, but when it's happening it has to be total disaster. And so it is. Times changed since release of Colin McRae Rally, but trash still persists.Buying mobile game on Steam for 6,99€, is it crime or it is not? My grammar as well may be crime but let it flow. I won't be really that hooked up on the fact that it's mobile port if it at least have some similar traits to previous legend or at least some or just little bit of nostalgia. When you spend your childhood playing PlayStation 1 and one of the most scratched disk be Colin McRae, you'll really get mad when somebody ehm Codemaster states that it's classic experience.Game will last you under 5 hours. Races are easy, times are weak, visual and audio oh god terrible (doesn't matter that much to me), gameplay experience is zero, damage and repair is not funny like it used to back then and actual locations are whack. 16 easy achievements and trading cards are not even worth talking as something why it's worth to get this game.Bonus Point: Lancer EvolutionRating: 2/10 ",105,13,6,7,13,1,6

The ""AI"" is so hilariously fake. The textures are even more low-res than CMR2.0 Less cars and tracks than CMR2.0 which was released in 2000If you want to experience the classic game fully then getColin McRae Rally 2.0 + SilentPatch for it to work better on modern systems.orFor modern rally game get DiRT Rally.

												Like many others, I bought this game expecting a re-released version of the original with some graphics updates and without the hassle of getting an old copy to run on modern hardware. This is not that game.What we have instead is a stripped-down version with less cars, fewer stages and fewer set-up/repair options which was previously released for mobile devices. Between purchase and writing this review the store description has been updated to reflect this, but it still leaves a faint glimmer of hope that this might be something better. Don't be under any illusions  - you're paying to play the mobile version with better controls on a bigger screen.In fairness to Codemasters, this is at least a competent driving game. The cars handle at least as well as in the original, with noticeable changes between surfaces. Car damage does affect performance, but the scaled-back repair interface takes away most of the decisions in choosing what to fix between stages. There are only four cars available to drive (three of which must be unlocked by completing events), but they recreated as well as possible in the engine.Ultimately though, I can't recommend this. It may only be £4.99, but that still feels expensive for a cut-down version of a ten-year-old game. You would be better-off spending your money on a copy of the original on ebay and taking the time to get it working			",169,50,5,27,27,2,51

												Oh boyI sure do love ""HD"" remakes of old games that have marginally less pixilated graphics and take out well over half the content of the original game.Get it for $1 or less if on offer, if you're okay with 2-3 hours of mild entertainment at most.Beyond that, don't bother with this.It's a port of a phone game based on the original. Mildly reminiscent of the 1998 game, but not enough to be deserving of the same name by any stretch of the imagination.LIST THING LIKE WHAT YOU PEOPLE LIKE:+The handling is pretty decent with a controller+The system of car damage and how that effects performance seems to be fairly solid++gives an enjoyable sense of speed, exhilarating near misses and etc++++Ever wondered what it would be like to play 3 of the 1998 version's locations without a ridiculously low draw distance? Well you're in luck.+threw enough bloom and nice looking static backdrops at it until it looked marginally better than the 16 year old original. Lets give a big hand to all the hard working artists at Codemasters.+sound is adequate, though the co-driver's commentary would perhaps be more annoying if I wasn't blinded by nostalgia+still fun gameplay, but in a way that doesn't keep you from feeling disappointed about how minimal an effort was put into this-most of the positives are inherited from the original--this is a port of a phone game port of the original-Apparently steering wheels aren't very easy to set up for it---5 less locations than the 1998 original-all the stages within each location are all a bit samey (to be fair, also inherited)-not having 8 less cars than the 1998 original would have cost codemasters too much-no online leaderboards, no online anything---------no split screen multiplayer either----------------------no cheats for turning your car into a hovercraft-I don't know how they took all those touched up screenshots to have a camera angle that isn't straight ahead, because I sure couldn't move the camera at all.-I've played for 2 hours, already unlocked half the game content-what I haven't unlocked consists of 2 other cars and three rallys comprising of locations and stages that I have already played, but this time with the abritrary ""this is where the computer car would be"" icon that scrolls along a bar at the top of the screen moving a bit faster-----------doesn't play the playstation startup tune when the game is first loading (unforgivable oversight)-doesn't fetch the newspaper for you-It's not 1998 anymore-I'm getting old-you're getting old-you used to be beautiful-I'm just not feeling it anymore, alright?

												Do not let my playtime deceive you. I have played for 10 minutes and read countless threads in the games forum.I am very upset/dissapointed with Codemasters. I want a refund.CONS- This game is a port of a mobile game- There is no skill needed to play- Ther is no real controller support (Right trigger only accelerates on release of button DA FUQ?)- This is nothing like Colin McRae 2.0- At £4.99 it's grossly over priced (it's only worth to me is £1 max)PROS- None IMODo not buy this game, unless you want to play a terrible mobile racing game with poor controller support.

												Codemasters must be either running out of cash or just be plain stupid to remake this game. Sure, if they hadn't lazed out and just strapped on some ""better"" looking textures and cleaned up the audio I could have digged it. But this? No, just no! If you're gonna remake a classic game in this day of age, at least make sure to give it proper controls! It can be played with a 360 gamepad, with DIGITAL input only! That's just so stupid I have no nice words for it. Stay FAR AWAY from this even if it should be on sale, especially if you as me grew up playing the Colin McRae series of games, you'll just end up being sad and frustrated over this piece of garbage!

												I played Colin Mcrae Rally 2.0 on the original PS1 back in the day, and it is still to this day my favorite racing game EVER! But this game is NOT a HD-remake, its all just a ♥♥♥♥ing lie!! Don't Buy this! Its a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Iphone Game. This game shows how much respect Codemasters has for Colin Mcrae (who has sadly passed away in 2007). All the customisation is gone and even the UI is horrible and not even changed for the 'PC version'. Its maybe worth it at 1 or 2 dollar just for the nostalgia.			",204,23,8,18,18,1,7

												A far cry from the old Colin Mcrae Rally games. This is a glorified port of a mobile game. All the cars and stages are locked except for one, and you have to unlock them one by one. You can't modify your car's settings before a race (suspension, brake power, front/back steering, etc), there is no time trial mode. The stages feel empty and narrow, even more so than the PSone games. The difficulty is a joke, you can ♥♥♥♥ up massively multipe times in a stage and still finish a minute ahead of the rest.Final Score: 2/10Do Not Buy			",382,59,15,67,39,3,48

												Well where to begin with this game, I purchased it on the basis that I was going to re-live my childhood memories and play a game that got me addicted to the racing genre, my first race I'm thinking ""oh this is cool"" but then it is downhill from there. I start the career mode, struggling to figure out how to increase the difficulty, no you can't the ""championship"" is split up into several championships, where the AI starts off super easy in the first and then gets progressively harder towards the last championships. To add even more insult the first three championships are just based on their respective countries, i.e. Australia is the first championship and Greece is the second. Then they will ""Mix"" it up a bit and add a championship with all three countries stating ""it’s time to test your skill on more difficult changing terrains!"" no all they did was make the AI slightly more difficult to beat. Where the AI is concerned it is clear that for each championship they just have a set time to beat which obviously gets harder as you move onto the next championship. Secondly they start the race at 40MPH (so during the later championships you are just playing catch-up) and clearly do not suffer from car damage and hairpin turns, because from start to finish their progress bar moves at the same speed. Next is the damage system! I crash into a tree full on and my car is fully repaired for the next set of races, I cut a few corners and I have no time to repair my car properly resulting into the next two races being a challenge to stop the car from blowing up. Last the sound is♥♥♥♥♥♥ I constantly hear screeching as if I’m sliding on tarmac even if I am playing on a DIRT road, when wearing a headset it will give you a right bloody headache. Codemasters, can you just tell us what the AI target time is on the last championship? If I know then I won’t need to keep on this repetitive ride of going through the same championship over and over and over again, I can just do a time trial. It’s a good thing that this was marketed as ""based on"" and not a remake, otherwise I would of had a refund, the only way this would be worth the money is if Codemasters threw in the original CMR 2.0 and give us the rest of the game! Where the funk are the other countries? Only three!. The game does have its plus points though, it works well with an Xbox 360 pad and if you handbrake around a bend you get the satisfying sound of the handbrake clicking!			",111,5,13,11,8,4,5

												[UPDATE]I've reverted to a No. Don't buy this game. It's clear the game has seen little to no effort put into it by Codemasters, and there are just too many games better than this to waste your time with it. Even once I'd adjusted the setup of controls to make it more playable, I found I just coudn't be bothered. It's uninspiring and dull, and the menus are about as slick as a car stuck in mud.Play one of the Dirt series or even Xpand Rally before this. Don't give Codemasters the idea that their ports of mobile titles are acceptable.New score: 3, and game deleted, even if it doesn't take up much space.[original review]I've gone for a tentative Yes here, despite me kind of only half liking it. If you buy it and try it, you're getting a useful insight into mobile gaming ported to PC. You're also getting one of a few sparse rally games available for PC these days, and for that, it does hold some value. Just make sure you buy it cheap!I had already bought this on Android and it didn't last long before I deleted it. In hindsight I do wonder if I'd merely missed a config screen allowing you to adjust sensitivity, and in the case of PC, dead zone too.  For my first couple of goes on PC, it was horrible with a 50% deadzone meter and maximum sensitivity. The car would barely turn for most of the stick's travel, then suddeny lurch, makign it twitchy an unresponsive at the same time. Wholly unpleasant. However, step the deadzone down to a few notches off minimum, and reduce the sensitivity to about 35% and it's a different animal; it feels to control much better.There are still issues mind... such as the controller being useless in some menu screens so that you can't actually select the Proceed button; or when up becomes down and vice versa.Once or twice too when driving what appeared to be a rock and incident free stretch of track, the car would flip like it'd hit a big rock, causing confusion and delay as you roll the car and often end up facing the wrong way.If I was to rate this game out of 10, I'd go for a 6. Which kind of puts it just above average and worth a go. Though I cannot stress enough: ONLY IF IT IS CHEAP.			",532,181,50,87,73,5,52

This game is f*** boring.Have you ever almost fall asleep during race? Have you hit the wall and realised that after one minute because you were thinking about what to prepare for dinner? Yeah - it's THAT boring.Also i had weird controler problems. I changed buttons bindings in launch menu and ocassionally they changed themself during race.

												Ok, where to begin. I suppose I should mention before anything that this is purely a mobile port taken straight off the app store and shoved into Steam for what I can only assume is a quick bit of money making. The price itself isn't all that bad and if you don't have an iPhone/iPod etc. and you want to play this then fine, but go into it with the certainty that it is a mobile port, the feel and style of the original seemingly lost to the pages of gaming history. To get the full experience you'll need to play through championships to unlock other cars/rally's etc. Not a bad mechanic in itself but this game makes it feel like such a chore. First the AI is humorously slow, on my very first attempt i beat them by a minute and a half (and while I may be mistaken I couldn't for the life of me find any option to up the difficulty). Secondly there is no sense of speed while driving, I remember the original leaving me on the edge of my seat, sweating trying to work out what just happened. This just left me feeling like I was stuck in traffic during a long drive home after an exhaustingly long day of work. Now it is perhaps worth noting that my experience and therefore memory of the original may have been skewed by a 6 year olds sense of wonder and far too many Smarties, but I am not quite yet senile so I doubt it is that skewed.It has some positives, like the version I played on an iPod I was impressed by the audio, each time I passed some fans I got a little kick out of the cheers and sounds of horns but alas this kick fades way before I reach the next cluster of my adoring groupies. The handling is average for a mobile so as far as you approach the game expecting that it’s not too much of an issue, though I still feel like I have more chance of power sliding driving at 40 KM/H in that traffic I mentioned (I feel like the game has assists enabled but no way to turn them off…).And that I feel is as good as any point to leave this review on, what is a pretty good mobile game somewhat unsurprisingly makes an entirely dull PC game.

												This is NOT Colin McRae Rally 2.0 remastered for the latest gen of PCs.  Most of the cars and tracks of the original game are missing.  You cannot even tweak your suspension set-ups, a necessary part of any true rally sim, such as the original CMR 2.  As well, my G27 steering wheel barely works: turning is either full right or full left with no in between.  Pure arcade.  If you're a rally simulation fan, you'll be soundly disappointed.  However, I will admit that if you're an arcade, keyboard only driver, you may enjoy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As others have said, this seems to be a port of a mobile game. And looking beyond that, I still cannot recommend this game. It lacks meaningful content, with only like 5 cars and a limited amount of courses. Most of it has to be unlocked, which is little unfair because the game is not enjoyable enough to want to unlock all of it. All of the cars and courses should have been unlocked from the beginning.It doesn't have the same feel of the CMR games in the past, like 2005, or maybe I am just remembering the wrong thing. However, the presentation is decent. It looks okay, and sounds okay. But that does not save this game. At best, this should be purchased when it is on sale as it is only good for a cheap CMR fix.

												Colin McRae Rally (2014) would have been a somewhat acceptable rally game in 1996. Graphics might have been decent in early 2000s. Sadly it came out in 2014, meaning that it is not somewhat acceptable nor decent.This is NOT a remake of original Colin McRae Rally, no matter what the game's store page implies. Instead it is a mobile game by the same name ported to PC. It looks like a mobile game, it sounds like a mobile game, it definitely feels like a mobile game, and it has the complexity and realism of a mobile game. So it is a mobile  game. And not a very good one either.I especially ""like"" how the game engine has trouble handling jumps. Weird things often happen when your car becomes airborne. Like your car attempting to do an aileron roll for no apparent reason, or being stopped by an invisible obstacle when landing. Though I would say that the game engine has trouble not just with jumps, but with pretty much everything related to driving. Controls are unresponsive and most of the time playing feels like you are driving a brick around. A somewhat weirdly behaving brick.And I absolutely ""love"" the fact that most of the objects you see on the road are completely static, which means that either they are sprites and you go through them without any physical reaction from either the car or the object, or they seem to weigh couple of metric tons regardless of size or material, stopping the car instantly. That is so 1990s. I guess you could call that retro.Also the amount of content is minimal with just few different rallies, and there is no replay value at all. Really.Very much NOT recommended.

												I was not able to bear playing this game for more than half an hour.Except for some fine graphical effects and acceptable rally stages, this game is comprised of only poor or horrible elements: wonky physics, no analog steering, terrible optimization (runs worse than DiRT 3 for me) and no interesting completion rewards.To be honest this game shouldn't cost more than 1€.

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!I really wanted to give this a good review. I had a lot of great memories playing the original 2 Colin McRae rally games as a kid. When I saw this pop up on Steam I didn't hesitate to buy it.That was huge mistake. I thought I would play it through before reviewing it in the hope it would redeem itself, but it just got worse. Firstly this is not a remake, rather its a re release of a mobile verion of the game. the controls are evidence of this. No matter how hard I try I cannot get this to work with either my controller or steering wheel. The inputs seem to change everytime you play the game or just flat out refuse to work. There were 16 cars in the original Colin McRae 2.0 game, this has 4!The menus are awful, the resolution keeps changing between menus and racing, the physics are completely broken, and due to the control issues I cant finish the game. also whenever you touch the steering controls it seems to cut the power to the car, making it basically impossible to complete.Codemasters have majorly dropped the ball with this one, which is such a shame, because they have done so well with DiRT Rally.

												Where to start with this? First of all, despite all the buzzwords you are fed about it being a ""HD Reboot"" and ""Based on Colin McRae Rally 2.0"", DO NOT BE FOOLED. It is not the original, nor is it 2.0. It is simply a port of the mobile version, generously referred to as a ""Reboot"".Expect: Bare-bones graphics, dismal damage engine that is somehow worse than the orignal CMR on PS1, forward-facing sprites, indestructible shrubbery (Robert the Shrubber would be proud), a draw distance that gives the impression that somebody is physically drawing the terrain slowly with a blunt pencil, handling that makes you think that you are in fact driving on retextured damp tarmac, A bad taste in your mouth as the money leaves your account, Nicky Grist.DO NOT EXPECT: Fun, a wide variety of cars/locales (FOUR, that's right FOUR cars and FOUR countries...), HD Graphics, a game worthy of the name, a feeling of accomplishment, willingness to continue playing past ten minutes.Do not treat this title as a true PC release, as the description and media samples on the store page try so hard to portray, but as what it is; a port of a mobile game that wasn't even that spectacular as a mobile game. Save your money, or not. It's your funeral. Personally I'd rather just dig through my decades-old CDs and try to make the originals work - it's much less irritating, and you haven't actually lost any money.AVOID.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Maybe the game works well as a mobile title. I’m not a mobile gamer personally, but I can imagine firing this up on my way to work or on a long journey, and then pretty much forgetting about it. With a Metacritic score of 69 it clearly isn’t a bad game in the context of mobile gaming, but mobile gaming and PC gaming are two very different domains, and taken in a PC context this is just a lazy-♥♥♥ port.If Colin McRae Rally HD does one thing well it’s remind us all how much we’d actually love a true, lovingly crafted remastering of the original game, one upgraded to todays visuals. With tender care and modern mechanics introduced it could be brilliant. This new release bearing the legendary name, however, is utterly uninspiring, both as a game itself and as homage to the originals.The Good:+ Handles okay.+ Car models look okay.The Bad:– Looks bad.– Loads of stuff missing.– Nothing like the original.– Badly ported.With such a low price it’s perhaps worth a go just for the brief, shallow slice of nostalgia it provides, but the original Colin McRae Rally 2.0 still works on PC and can be bought for the same price. Get that instead.			",217,62,8,24,14,3,18

												definitely NOT THE COLIN MCRAE rallly from the days of yore. Just did the first introductionaty race and it's more than enough to see what it is, or more precisely - is not. probably will appeal to those who just want to play a rally type game, but I can't really recommend it even for them as the graphics are kinda... mobile like and outdated (makes sense as it is a port of a mobile release...). If you want a better looking and a proper rally game with some extra on top of it - go and get the first DiRT game. That game is old, but still looking and feeling good. Don't waste money on this one, only if you get it in a bundle and out of curiosity want to see what it is. (dunno, maybe I would give a little kid to play it, but can't say that rally racing is a game that appeals to most kids of that age).			",81,9,6,10,4,0,6

												Before you buy this game you need to realise that this is not a full HD remake of Colin Mcrae Rally 2.0 but a port of the mobile phone version, which contains far less content. 3 different rally zones, Australia, Greece and Corsica. It also only has 4 drivable cars, the Ford Focus, Subaru Impreza, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution and the Lanica Stratos. Whether more tracks and cars will become available later down the line, I don’t know.The menu design is rather clunky and is clearly designed for a touch screen device and there is no tuning section for your car and no replays after each race. There is however a section for repairing your car after 2 rally stages although as far as I can see the damage on your car does little to how you perform during a race.As for the racing the controls are okay, the graphics are also okay however some of the textures such as the walls can look very ugly, alot of the sprites also look fairly blend eg. Crowd members and trees. To get round this there is quite a bit of motion blur which does make the game look smoother at times.The pyhsics of the game are also okay but not great. There is some visual damage to your car when you hit objects, but this could be improved massively. There are also inconsistences in the track I found myself getting caught on flat bits of land and getting flung up into the air with no real reason.Finally the speed, when I first started the game I thought I hadn't set my car up correct because it seemed so slow. In many rally cars you find yourself in constant battle to keep the car under control, however here you can hold down the gas/acceleration button for the majority of the time without having many issues.So my thoughts this game is okay at best, but it could of been more, should of been more. It should have brought back the old school Colin Mcrae Rally 2.0 memories. But this game simply doesn't live up to that title and that’s a shame. ",16,1,5,0,9,1,7

												Usually, when I write some impressions I always speak about what the game is all about instead of what it could have been. However, in a rally game with Colin McRae in the title it’s a bit hard to not see the true potential that has gone to waste. The description of the origin of the game tell no lies, it’s a port of a mobile game so we are aware of what we can expect in terms of visuals and weather effects, sound, and so on. However, there is some information that not only I do not agree but I also find it to be a bit misleading.The description of the game mentions different types of surfaces. While this may be true, aside of road and off-road I didn’t see any other variations. There is no mud, no heavy dust, no snow or wet tracks giving you a very limited window when it comes to variety. Speaking of variety, the number of cars you can drive is really small, only four are available. This is a very low number for a rally game and to make it worst you need to unlock them if you want to race with them in the championship. The four cars are the Ford Focus, Subaru Impreza, the classic Lancia Stratos and the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI. The sound is as important for me as the visuals and if you are a racing fan you will want to have those crazy sound engines screaming for the next shift but once again you can’t expect such thing in this game, which is fine for a mobile port but insufficient for a PC game.In the end I played the game and got most of it, however there is not much to see and do which makes you search for better alternatives. The final line from the Store description ends with a bang but I’m afraid to be a really misleading sentence. It says “The Classic Rally Experience Races on PC and Mac” and I couldn’t agree less. This is not true at all no matter how big or small you are into racing games. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Colin Mcrae RallyWhen buying this game I got some great feelings that this game would bring me some good nostalgia. I played a lot of Colin Mcrae games when I was a kid. This game... it isn't the thing I thought it is. This is just a port from the mobile version. Grade for this 6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is not the CMR you're looking for.Make sure not to pay more than 2EUR or so for it as it has very little content to it. You mostly drive the same tracks all over and the first three cars are too similar. Finally Lancia feels more fun to drive but is let down by the atrocious concept of gravity this game has in general which seems to think the car is a balloon which wants to barrel roll every time it catches air.Gameplay in general has that nostalgic feel you want from it (ie the original game) but it is let down by the lack of content and frustrating implementation of gravity. The original PC version was much more versatile and I'm sad this is not it.			",70,11,6,12,4,0,18

												I don't really know wat this thing is but one thing i know for sure, THIS IS NOT Colin McRae Rally!The game feels like trash, the few tracks it has, feel all the same, cars don't change the handling in the ""different"" surfaces , and the phisics are terrible, crashes ridiculous to look at and you only have 4 cars 4!! They tried to take some aspects of the true colin Mcrae rally 1 and 2.0, so it would feel like such games but they failed, it is not close, it is not even close to a demo of those games, IT IS NOT CLOSE TO ANYTHING CODEMASTERS MADE TO DATE.Stay away from this horror and save your coins, not even for free this game is worth your time.

												EDIT/ IT'S POSSIBLE UNTIL AUGUST 19TH TO HAVE A REFUND ON THE GAME!!!http://forums.codemasters.com/discussion/comment/37019/#Comment_37019Today i connect on steam and see this game. I see particulary the icon wirh the Focus and the colin|mcrae|Rally, i hold my breath and think, ""damn, is that a sort of remix of CMR2.0, the best rally game i ever played, the one which sometimes i play with my PS3?"". I look at the description, based on CMR2.0, 30 levels, 130km, i was like ""finally, i will be able to play to a proper rally game on my pc"", a real one not like all the recent rally game in which you have gymkhana, a caravan, sponsors every where, thousands of different races, a ""story"" in which you have to become the best, drive like ken block (even if i like some of his videos) doing circle and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on a parking lot and drive on a real rally stage 5 minutes every hour. There's some other rally games, but they're never good. So, the price should have been a little warning, but for a (very good) PS1 game HD remake i thought it wasn't so much. So i bought it, launch it and first ""shock"", the soundtrack in the menu, not the one i know, whatever, i'm not here for that, i want to play, less menu, no car settings, ok, ok, if they keep the essence of CMR i'm ready to lose a few things...I start to drive, gearbox in manual, like the good old times, and few minutes after i thought, maybe it's me, or the Xbox one controller, i haven't the same feeling than before. I continue to drive, in order to be sure, and finally the conclusion arrive. The cars seems to never manage to accelerate properly, i never goes further than the fourth gear and 120km/h, in fact you can but only in straight lines, the handbrake isn't very present, the physics of the games seems clearly far of CMR2.0, i was able to take corners sideways on the old game and the cars really gives the impression that you were doing it (the camera was helping too), here you can slide but, it seems to be difficult fot the car to slide when in place, when you turn, the cars slow down too much, you can't really make it slide very long.So if you consider buying this game while thinking to CMR2.0, forget it, clearly codemaster shouldn't have evoke CMR2.0 in the description, that's miles away (in the wrong direction) of it. It's a disappointement to see that the name of a good rally games, is used to promote a cheap one.			",17,0,3,5,11,1,2

												This game was promoted in a misleading way, if it had have been made clear that it was a mobile port, then perhaps it wouldn't have received nearly as many poor reviews. The fact it was written as an 'HD remake' is EXTREMELY misleading, as there are far fewer features in this game than the origional 1998 release, which is disheartening, considering it is 18 years from release, and this game most likely costs more than the origional.As a Steam game, the controls are inconsistant to put it as well, as I can. The races were easily winnable on the first play through without even using the brake (either one). There were almost no customisation options availble, even with regards to controller settings.Ultimately a dissapointing addition to an otherwise well made series.Though it is worth noting they've improved the graphics since the last 'colin Mcrea Rally' release in 2005 (so not including the 'Dirt' series).

												I wanted to know why this game has such poor reviews, so i played it... for a 2014 game on steam it has not much to offer.No multi player, only five cars, no customisation whatsoever, no physical computer to race against, poor graphics, glitches that makes you jump in the air, no music, an anooying co driver and god! avoid the ditches because for all i know there is no respawn key. The races and the controls are both fine, but the good things in this game do not compensate for what is flawed. And what a better way to finish a race by being told (OKAY!).

												This is not a rally simulation. There are not a ton of cars or tracks. This is a port of the mobile game which is a low budget arcade racer. If you are okay with all of that then you will most likely enjoy this game.- The graphics are outdated but get the job done. A lot of the assets seem to be taken straight from the old CMR games.- The audio is decent. Most of the audio seems to be from the old CMR games as well.- The physics are extremely arcadey. The cars are pretty slippery but in a fun way.- The AI drivers (Colin McRae specifically) seem to be immune to car damage. Always going full speed while you're car is chugging along. This is more noticeable towards the end of the game because there are more endurance events. It is all about damage management while going as fast as possible.I really enjoyed this game and would recommend it to arcade race fans and rally fans. I had no idea this was a mobile port until I was halfway through. That didn't stop it from being fun. There are a ton of terrible racing games on Steam that cost much more than this, I'm not sure why people are so down on it. For $6.99 I have little to complain about.			",268,63,28,49,27,3,41

I am also stupid as I did not read the full description about this being from a mobile game and nothing to do with the real Colin McRae pc games, but that is the last thing I expected to find. Now I know more about the deviousness of Steam! :(Well, the game sucks big time. The physics are garbage, there are hardly any cars and only a few tracks. There is no realism in the driving.

												Hit something in frustration  as Colin McRae Rally, the ultimate off-road racing game experience, fails to return  to PC From different developers to those of the multi-million selling franchise and based on content from the 90% Metacritic rated Colin McRae Rally 2.0 (ie. rally based experience, cars involved), Colin McRae Rally for Windows PC features all the tracks and cars from last year's top selling mobile title that got a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ score on Metacritic with THIRTY amazing rally stages with a combined distance of over 130km. Go flat out through the flat dirt and the flat dust of the Australian outback, take on flat climbs through the mountains of Greece and get sideways on the tight and twisty roads of Corsica. THE CARS Get behind the wheel of four legendary rally cars, the Subaru Impreza, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI, Lancia Stratos and Colin McRae’s Ford Focus. Pace notes read by professional rally co-driver Nicky Grist help you fully commit through each and every stage. THE CONTROL With the critically acclaimed Colin McRae Rally handling nowhere to be seen,  and, allegedly, a damage and physics model under the hood, feel nothing as you put pedal to metal  across different surface types that all feel the same and blast through dismal and unchallenging environments. Race with a range of pads, including Xbox 360 and PS3 controllers.

And actually has the licensed branding for it's cars instead of little bracket shapes and boxes.Shame Dirt 1 and 2 were removed from steam and instead of Codemasters working on Steamworks integration they made this instead.

												Colin McRae Rally is not a good game. The controls are very poor, bordering on nigh unplayable at times. The cars bounce more than bobble heads and are ridiculously easy to flip and crash with simple traversing over a simple jump at low speeds. The game offers four cars that have zero difference in handling or acceleration with three of them being locked until progress is made into the championships. There are a number of different championships to play thru and each becomes progressively more difficult. The game runs fine, looks decent, and could have the potential to be better if a patch to fix the car physics and controls were introduced. For the first few hours, you'll likely tolerate the controls, but after a couple of hours past the point of no longer being refundable, you realize that this was not a good investment. The game does have steam cards and steam achievements so at least those work properly.Not recommended, not even on a good sale. Save your money for something better.			",367,166,31,70,75,13,55

												If you seriously want to play Colin McRae Rally 2, get the original and patch it with a silent patch. The game looks so much sharper, the controls feel much more analog and correct, the cars accelerate properly and you have the full content.If you really want to play this game in this version, get it on mobile, its not such a shame on that. If you want to play a good Rally game, get Dirt Rally. And if your PC is to weak to handle that, just get Colin McRae Rally 4 or 5, those are already so much better than this game. BTW I'm really happy that I got this with Dirt Showdown for like 2 bucks, otherwise I wouldn't even have touched it			",24,2,5,0,6,0,0

Absolute garbage !! do not buy this p.o.s i don't even know why it carries the name Colin McRae it has NOTHING to do with original series.Colin Mcrae Rally 2.0 was one of my favorite racing games so i was excited to have this new version .... until i played it.Lets put it in simple words , if you're a fan of old CMR do not buy this !!  this doesn't have any of the features that made those games great , driving physics , customization , feeling of speed , great  tracks , lots of cars ,   dynamic and challenging ,   you name it it's all gone , complete waste of money it really seems like a bad joke rather than a game.This isn't CMR remake , it's rubbish mobile port  with crappy mobile phone type of UI and a car that seems to be movig but it feels like a wagon with coal rather than a racing car , graphics is worse than original , 4 cars  and ............  and that's it really because i could not suffer this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t longer than 10 minutes.Codemasters should be ashamed to release this garbage , it's going to make me seriously consider bying any of their games in the future. 0/10 !!P.S The best part of this game will be deleting it			",319,70,9,33,22,5,71

												See that play time count? A half hour is all you need to experience all this game has to offer. This is an arcade style rally racing game that will run on any system. A strange combination of marketing tech-demo (this game was heavily sponsored by Ford) and racing simulation, you may be at first puzzled by the simplistic graphics and dumbed down controls, but it does warrant a look, especially if yiou're looking to have a little bit of mindless fun.No controller or multplayer support, limited graphics gratification and ... where's the music? reduce this to a game best acquired in a bundle, as part of a sale, but not at full price. For a superior experience that caters to casual drivers, buy any of the Dirt or Grid franchise. In a market of superior Free-to-Play options there's no reason to pay for an inferior experience, all round.This is a good game, doing what it does, but don't set your expectations too high.

												Therefor, that the game released in 2013 it's quite honestly bad.It's for the fact, that the graphics are really poor and simple, the interior of car models missing and many more things, that just don't feel right. The physics for example, are just absurd. There are trees the diameter of a few centimeters, that won't  even move a bit, nor breaking off but destroying your car when you approach with high speed. There are advertising tables standing around, that have the same effect. It also happens too often, that you are slowed to almost 0 after making a small jump and touching the road again, as if there would be an invisible big♥♥♥♥♥rock laying on the street.Another funny thing are jumps and wobbly parts of the road before a jump, that make your car flip on the roof. It's like making a barrel roll because your co-driver is 10 times your weight. The complete game is unbalanced and absolutely NOT recommended to play on a PC. It might be an casual funny little game on a phone, but definetly not a game, that Codemaster should sell at such high price and for PC.			",49,1,10,6,11,0,5

												For some reason, people believes this is a port of the old CMR games from the ps1 days, and later on pc. Well, this is not.I have all of them and, even though I never liked their handling model, this is even worse and the only things in common are the name and some assets.It can't have the same gameplay anyway, since this one uses a different engine, Unity, which is also partly what makes this game so bad.The performance of this game, compared to the graphics, are terrible. It runs just fine in my system, but DiRT2 and 3 at Ultra runs even better here, reaching solid 60fps at 1080p, while this one has worse graphics than CMR 2.0 and runs as badly as the last Batman game.Then there's the ""physics"", if so can be called, that are so unrealistic that gives the game a much higher difficulty level than what's supposed to have. They could have opted for the arcade handling model of the CMR series, but instead tried to make something just too big for this terrible engine, and it ended up becoming one of the worst racing games of all times, on par with Team6 titles.Controls? People, again, believes this supports gamepads and so ""you can control it better than on the smartphone"": nope.Although it does support gamepads, the controls are not analog, meaning that the analog sticks will act as digital sticks, which adds problems to the already terrible handling.That's at least what happens to me with the 2 different gamepads I own, and to many other people that can actually understand how analog handling feels like. If it only works for some specific gamepad model is beyond my knowledge, but since Unity has many problems with input devices, it might as well be.There's a load of other little and big problems with this game, such as a terrible menu, terrible configuration screen, basically no graphics options, static tracks and backgrounds, no replays, bland and dated graphics, recycled music from CMR 3 (from what I remember)...I can't really find a single positive thing to say about this game. I got it from the Codemasters bundle and I thank myself for not having spent even 1 euro on this title alone, because it doesn't matter how cheap you can buy it at, it's not worth the time it will make you waste.If you think this could be a nice time waster or a little arcade racer to spend some time on between more serious games, well that's a mistake: the terrible handling and bad pad support makes racing artificially too hard to be enjoyable, and I'd like to see how many of the positive reviewers actually could, or wanted to, complete the game.

You have to be a f***** rocket scientist to configure these controls, cause it's not defaulting to a standard 360 controller, and if you by a mistake happen to set wrong input, as I did, I didn't see that it said Wheel setting, som I set my analog left stick to use that setting, then your out of luck, cause you can't remove settings, and of course there's no ""Reset control settings to default"", so i uninstalled the game, installed it again, even checked that the install folder was removed before, but nooo, the settings is still there, so f*** this game, i Love Colin McRae Rally, so next time I want to play it, I'll dust off my old PlayStation instead.

												5/10+ the title's name brings lots of nostalgia for older gamers+ driving isn't totally crap, average handling, driving most of the time on dirt is ok+ familiar voice from the co-driver (don't remember his name)- bad graphics and presentation (even the menus are .... borrowed from colin 4)- no variety on anything, limited cars, limited stages, they say it contains maps from colin 1+2? i am sure it misses most of them-no customization options like changing the tires, setting the brakes etc. repair system is a joke as well- driving is not smooth as i remember it, simplified driving on dirt with average handling, bad physics (if i can call them that) and collision detection, there is no feeling of speed- much easier than the original games, no challenge at all, i remember every sec counted , now even if u crash a lot it's very easy to finish firsti was totally disappointed. colin 2 was one of my favorite racing games, there is no comparison to that. instead of going forward codemasters are going backwards, i hope either they leave the colin mc rae titles alone or if they decide to make a new game, to do so with respect to the gamers.

												Obvous cash grab is obvious.Seriously, don't get this one. The graphics might be better than the original Colin McRae on PS1, but that's about it. The handling is about as fake as fake can be. This might have been a good accelerometer racing game for your iPhone (a racing genra I'm not a fan of), but it has no business being released in this state on PC, and no amount of patches could make this game suitable for PC gaming. The original Colin McRae series had some really fantastic rally games in it (at least in the time they were released), but putting his name on this title was an insult to his memory.

												Be wary of the bad reviews, they are invariably by people who simply didn't read the very clear description that describes exactly what this game is:  ""Colin McRae Rally features the car and track list from last year’s top selling mobile title and features THIRTY amazing rally stages in three environments taken from the PlayStation classic Colin McRae 2.0. for this PC and Mac edition.""  So, it's derived from the mobile game which was inspired by the original PS classic CMR.It's great.  It really took me back to the feel and fun and challenge of the old PS game but with modern look and sound.   It is not a simulator, it is a great game! Game as in fun.  Game as in play for 10 minutes or play for an hour.  You don't have to wait an age for it to load, or endure the latest in bad, loud synthetic music, or consult a manual and a physicist on car set up.  You just play!Some people criticise the physics of the cars.  I have never driven a 4WD but I have driven plenty of 2WDs on very bad surfaces and when I unlocked the Lancia Stratos I finally was driving a car that behaved how I remember cars behaving, including the sudden total and catastrophic loss of all control when you mess up!I bought this on a nostalgia trip when it was offered on Humble Bundle and it's now the game I've played the most hours on Steam.If you're looking for a sim or some kind of pseudo reality and hours of tinkering and stats and so on then look elsewhere. This is a great game for anyone who can read a short product description and wants to race for fun.			",32,1,1,2,0,2,3

												Pros:You can 100% this game in around 10 hours.The tracks are relatively short, no race is longer than 3-4 minutes.Cons:This game was designed for a 4 inch screen, so it looks hideous on a 40 inch.You will be bored out of your freaking mind. Each ""race"" is simply one car against a floating CPU guide at the top.There are four cars, and they all handle worse than the airboat in Half-Life 2.The ""campaign"" is basically four different tracks that you will race about 100 times with your four cars.Stay far away from this title, there is nothing of value here.

												Cautious recommendation. I paid 1.25 EUR and that's a fair price for what this game is. I haven't played Colin McRae Rally 2.0 in a good while, but this feels pretty faithful to the original. The game looks dated, as it should. Driving is stiff and there's way too much grip, same as I remember it, though I don't recall cars ever doing backflips during jumps or getting wrecked just by hitting timing gates. Selection of cars is limited compared to original, there's like 3 out of 8 original rallies. NO RALLY OF FINLAND WHICH WAS BY FAR THE BEST ONE. Car setup is gone. It's barebones Android port, really simple menus with huge buttons and all that. It's no CMR 2.0 2.0 (c'mon Codies!), but in the end it's still pretty fun. Good for a little  nostalgia trip.

												Do not buy..I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.I was lousy and stupid to get excited and thinking this was a proper HD remake of the original Colin Mcrae 2.0. I bought the game right away and just dove into it to find it's nothing more but a crappy Cellphone port, with other words not the real deal. The whole game is nerfed to no end, it lacks proper control settings, it lacks car settings before stages, it lacks modes, it lacks cars, hell it even lacks gameplay. It might look like great fun being able to go down the nostalgia road and play the great rally game classic all over again, but do not be fooled, this game is false advertisement and Valve should take it off steam.Lesson learned on my part, do not buy games without checking reviews first.

												My comparison is with Richard Burns rally which I played some time ago. Always wanted to try this and feel it was a waste of £5. Apart from the initial confusion finding out where to set up the controller I find that I cannot get rid of the dead zone which makes for an arcade feel rather than a driving simulation. OK for kids I suppose but not very satisfying for somebody with an understanding of just how difficult driving a rally car can be. In short no finesse!Out of ten I'd give this 2. ",22,1,7,0,7,0,2

												Watered down tablet ""conversion"" of the original. I'm using quotation marks since, astonishingly, the game is actually not based on the original CMR, but Colin McRae Rally 2.0 instead. But it's not a conversion of CMR2 either, it's only using some of the cars and some of the assets of the original. The garage options have been stripped down, the number of cars have been cut and difficulty level generally made easier.For some bizarre reason the championship requires you to complete two consecutive six-leg rallies in one location before moving to the next, which I don't remember being a feature in the original. Didn't see any nighttime special stages either, and the damage model feels more forgiving.The end result is a game that kinda feels like the CMR games of yesteryear, but then again kinda doesn't and will just aggravate you more based on how well you remember the first few Colin games. They should've just straight up ported CMR1 and be done with it. This game, while serviceable, definitely will not satisfy the fans of the originals.			",345,218,7,36,30,0,40

Good entry level rally gameIf you're completely new to the genre of rally racing, but like(d) racing games in general, this game might be a nice little introductionary game to get to test your interests in this genre. It has a simple damage model system, a couple championships with each a fair amount of stages. And only after a couple stages you're allowed to repair some of the major damage to your car, so be careful. The navigator is voiced by none other than Nicky Grist, Colin McRae's navigator at the time.The game seems to support racing wheel and gamepad. I've tried none and played it with keyboard.Whether it's worth the full price is up to your decision. I'd recommend to wait and put it on wishlist to see whether it will get in a sale and pick it up then. However if you're more serious into racing and want a simulator experience, then I'd recommend you to leave this page and search for DiRT Rally instead.So very simple entry rally game, but nothing for a serious (rally) racer.

												Colin McRae Rally is an arcade-style offroad racing game, where you can drive different offroad racers in a variety of circuits and tournaments. Now, I compare all racing games to Gran Turismo 2, which is in my humble opinion, the best racing sim I have ever played. It reminds me of the arcade play of Gran Turismo 2, where you could drive cars like the Lancer Evo on dirt tracks, against a second player or versus computer drivers; However, with Colin McRae Rally, you are going up against computer players times, rather than the actual cars on the track. I think this takes away from the realism of the game, because you don't have other drivers as obstacles to conquer and overcome, it's all about time instead. Visually, the game is so-so, but the cars are pretty detailed. There doesn't appear to be a lot of customization. In all, I wasn't overly impressed with the game, though it isn't exactly a dumpster fire either. It skates by, but there are other racing games out there which would be better.

												The sad part about this is that there is still people that cant tell the difference between an HD port of mobil game and an HD remake , first of all this game is the HD port of a mobil game to pc that was made based on the first colin mcrae rally game from ps1 era (not the second one) so you already have an idea about the overall quality of the game , the graphics are mediocre but not bad ( i saw worst then this) and still enjoyable (people are made cause there is no graphics options but like i said this is a port mobil game so no need for them), sound effects are nice and at point , the gameplay is smooth , the cars are few but well made. but that doesn't mean the game has no problems, i faced some and really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off here some :- car physics when you jump are totally rekt so don't even think about jumping ,you can fix this just by slowing down.- no multi but for me it wasn't really a problem cause i don't like multiplayer anyway- the game becomes really really unfair in the end ( the last 3 tournaments) , Colin mcRae becomes OP driving a boosted Ford and your car becomes really fragile , easily damaged just by driving it and you will rage just to get the 3rd position.its not  the perfect game out there but i'm pretty sure that the devs are aware of it , thats why the price is 6.99$ i mean c'mon there are games much much worse than this one and they cost double and + its on sale for the most of the time + it has cards and achievementsi recommend it for those who wants to remember the good old days of the ps1 ;)7/10			",636,174,27,75,40,8,63

												Such a classic arcade rally game.I love this game because it's very basic, easy to play, easy controls and a small sized game. Plus I'm a huge rally fan! #TeamSubaruI finished this is on iOS and have played this offline when I feel like a good rally game.People's expectations are way too high. This is a port from iOS after-all. Don't listen to the negative reviews, graphics ♥♥♥♥♥s these days... if you just want to kick back and play an easy rally game, this is the game for you. Price a little too high. $5 would be ideal. ",209,20,6,9,4,1,2

												Accurately simulates driving a Ford Focus right down to the horrible grinding noise heard when the car is in motion. To better represent actually driving a Ford Focus, only digital inputs are supported. The pieces falling off the Ford Focus during a race will give you an idea what it would be like to own or drive this car.However, the repair times are completely unrealistic. An actual Ford dealership would take 6-8 days to fix relatively minor problems.Recommended only if you plan to use keyboard to control, and already own Dirt 3 Complete, and are just getting this for cards.

												First, the brightside:I didn't give codemasters any money for this trash. 100% of the price paid for their bundle went to charity. This game will also make you totally wash your hands of this now terrible studio. For, it's the ultimate screw you and troll a developer could give you. But hey, I made a Ford Focus do a barrel roll after going up a gentle hill...The Reality:The game is bad but it's amazing HOW bad it is. Not just in everything that makes a game but they manage to make it even more obnoxious by having the people on the sidelines blare what I assume is supposed to be an airhorn sound or Vuvuzelas. Then the idiot narrating your course turns is just terrible and annoying. Combine that with obnoxious game ""music"", sound effects and everything, yeah. Screw you too, Codemasters. It's not even fair to say this game is terrible because it is a Mobile title. There are perfectly fine racing games on mobile that would play just as fine on PC. There is no excuse for this trash.This game isn't so bad it's good, it's just so bad that it toally reaffirms your hate for Codemasters and how they do business these days. If ever you needed a reason to hate a developer for legitimate reasons, it's right here. Play it and join the Rage and then never give Codemasters your business again. It's not like they're capable of making a competent game anymore, anyway.			",745,134,23,93,104,10,118

												Colin Mcrae Rally for Steam is a wonderfully crappy experience that everybody ages 0 through 100 should experience. The overall horrible physics paired with irresponsive controls make for an absolutely blissful playtime when racing throughout Australia over and over on the same few tracks.I felt right at home when my brake barely even responded, or when my speed sporadically went up or down a lot with the lightest change of the gas trigger. It felt like I was truly there.The graphics were immersive enough to fool me into thinking I was actually looking at my PS1 over a CRT TV. I loved the completely flat bushes and trees, as well as the completely solid tree texture surrounding the tracks. I wish more games were like this.The sounds were beautiful. I loved the monotonous whispers of the co-driver into my ear as I flew against every tree on the course. I loved the sound of a tin can engine pushing itself far too hard.I would truly recommend this game to anyone if they want to have a delightful experience of what a racing game shouldn't be. 10/10 would give more money if DLC existed.Real talk, go play the actual Colin McRae Rally 2.0 for PC, it's an actual game instead of this tin can of a mobile ""port.""hi reddit			",103,13,22,17,17,2,11

												I don't understand why so many people give this game a bad review.  Sure it has some flaws but for the price it is one of the best rally games you can buy.  The graphics are good, the cars and the stages look good.  The cars feel good on the terrain and sort of remind me of the feel of Forza Horizon rally.  The handling is good once you adjust the controls in options to your preference and works great with my xbox controller.  The damage and repair system isn't the best, but that's the aspect of championship mode that adds the challenge factor.  I recommend this game if you are a die hard racing fan or someone who knows how to enjoy a racing game.			",203,50,27,9,21,5,16

												This is a good game, but there are few things you have to consider when you are up to buy it.It seems to be mostly based upon Colin McRae Rally 2.0, and seems to be ported version from mobile device.General observations:- Quite a simple graphics judged by today expectations (still found of sufficient level to my mind). Looks like CMR2.0 with modern processing effects applied.- Quite an accurate car models of real vehicles- Decent physical model with unique behaviour for each vehicle- Each car seems to have it's own specific durability level of each system and tends to receive specific damage depending on your driving styleIn comparions with CMR2.0 some content is removed:- less cars avaliable- no tuning- simplified repairs- less rallies (no Finland, Sweden, Kenya and England)- no duel stages at the end of each rally- no weather and night stages- rallies are shorter (6 stages per rally max)- less camera modes- no arcade mode- much less unlockable contentI used to be very found of CMR series and especially of 2.0, but still I can make some mistakes in my comparison cause it was long ago when I used to play it.Summary:Don't take it as one of CMR istallments, but consider it to be separate game of more arcade style.Would siut casual players, those who llooks for CMR2.0 nostalgie sessions, people infamiliar with CMR series and looking for arcade with real vehicles with more or less realistic behavior.Will fail to meet your expectations if you are looking for something in line with established CMR experience.Anyway I'd still recommend this game as a good fun.

												I can't recommend this game for so many reasons:1) Very basic: - So far only 3 countries, and I assume the later rally's are rehashes of these (correct me if I'm wrong). - Can't see any customisation for cars. - Only 4 cars in total.2) Co-driver instructions are confusing, sometimes not timed well at all. And the direction arrows that show on screen sometimes obsruct your driving.3) Cars handle like rubbish. If you slow down too much, you lose all momentum, and if you try to keep your speed up, you'll likely still lose a lot of momentum, or slide as though you are riding a road bike going around corners on gravel - sliding uncontrollably off the road. Someone else said ""a brick with butter for wheels"". I'd agree.4) Graphics are forgettable. Car sounds, especially when moderately damaged, are rather annoying. All feels like a mobile port, and not a properly developed PC game.5) Probably forgotten something...If you like rally games, get any of the DiRT games. If you're not a fan of rally but wanted a casual arcadey game, don't buy this - I'm sure you can find a better game to spend a few bucks on.			",1569,694,73,134,55,17,121

												Ok, it's older than dirt...pardon the pun... Yeah, the graphics are a bit...flat...but it's at least as much fun as Dirt 2 with slightly worse car handling but I'll say this for it, the cars handle better than anything in GTA 5!.  It's just dumb fun without all the orgy of customizations and tweaks that are modern racing games.  The game is just a basic fun racer and that's all I want.  I don't know why people think a racing game has to be any more complicated than steer, brake, go pedal these days.  Give me a break people, you're playing a game not training for the 24 hours of LeMans.  I got this as a part of the humble bundle and I almost didn't install it from all the bad reviews.  Glad I found out for myself.  If you got it free or cheap just have fun with it.  Games are taken way too seriously these days but there's no possible way you can do that here so don't try.  Just have fun with it.			",61,2,9,6,2,1,1

												So I got this game in a bundle a while back and never thought of it much. Recently I've been itching to play some kind of racing game so I booted it up and from the 2 hours I've spent in it so far it seems like a nice little decent racing game. It's very bare bones but it does exactly what a racing game is supposed to do, you go from point A to point B while navigating corners. As far as I can tell the game is single player only races against a clock and there only seems to be a small amount of race tracks.Like I said, it's very bare bones but it's simple to get into, fun and decently priced so whatever.

If you touch a barrier with the back bumper, the barrier pulls your car into it and its a mess.- If you get it for €1 or €2, i say give it a shot, if your are into racing.Overall: 5 out of 10.

												Even considering the budget price, this is dreadful.  The cars are hard to control because there is no analogue steering - even if you use an analogue controller, the car only responds digitally, either all or nothing.  Also the brakes are extremely weak.  I've played most rally games over the last 16 or so years and this is the worst by a mile.  I got it in a bundle for $1 and still feel bad.  Codemasters must have no shame in releasing games of this subpar standard.			",134,23,26,12,10,3,11

												Sadly, I bought this game without reading the reviews, although I'm not that prone to impulsive buying - just because the name - it didn't occur to me that same name doesn't have to mean same game (or a decent remake/sequel/prequel/quisquidqel). This is just an arcade, not a rally sim, not even close. I'd be able to get over that if there were some decent wheel support, but no, it's crappy and at best can be played with an xbox controller - but frankly, why would anyone want to play this worthless piece of poor coding on anything?

												One of the worst driving games I have ever played.The graphics are too simplistic, the car controls like it's a brick with butter for wheels and the level design makes sure that when you lose control, you are going to get rekt hard.Oh and BTW, the car makes a ""lovely"" sound after you hit something, like Satan is scratching your balls on thin ice with a landmower.I'm usually pretty positive even with bad games, but this one has nothing going for it. I'm going to drop the cards and never touch this game again.			",663,64,35,35,20,5,19

												If you expect a remaster of the Original Colin McRae don't buy this. While this is in itself a fun little game, which in my opinion does compare to the elder titles graphics and handling wise, this is an original game. You've got 4 Cars to unlock, which i think is plenty, the rally tracks are fun, yet nothing to challenging. Don't expect either a Simcade nor a Game that lets you fondle with each cars settings. Every two stages you get the chance to spent your time to repair broken parts of your car and race for the title. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes an Arcade racer or is a fan of rally. It's fun, challenging at times, trying to take speed into a corner, while fighting against the shifting weight of the car. 4/5 ♥			",148,16,25,18,13,0,10

												I can't believe all of these negative reviews. Did you guys buy this expecting Dirt Rally? Sound is mediocre, controls are for the arcade, graphics and views are tolerable, but seriously what did you expect? Granted I just now paid 2bux for it on sale, but it's fun for a few quick races when you don't want to drag out the wheel or spend a good amount of time on it. It's very casual, and as others have said, essentially a mobile game at heart. I wouldn't spend more than 5 USD for it, but it's small and perfect to satisfy my rally itch. It's definitely something I'll keep installed.			",109,21,11,7,24,4,12

												BEWARE. READ BEFOR BUY!Whoever is about to buy this game be WARNED. This has nothing to do with Colin McRae PC series. This is jus a port of  mobile version of Colin McRae. What does it mean? On my example. I knew old pc game Colin McRae. IT looks similar but that`s it. Driving model is terrible. Completely different from original pc game. Just 4 cars and only few tracks. Physics in this game doesn`t exist. So if You`re a racing fan looking for good game and race feeling, keep looking for another title. Or at least try to find original Colin McRae PC game. NOT RECOMMENDED			",173,32,10,22,22,0,21

												If Colin would know about this release he had turned around in his coffin.The game feels like a mix from mario kart and wave racer driving physics with a colin mcrae 2.0 graphic overlay. A very linear ""career mode"" is also included to unlock those 3 other cars. If you have unlocked the best car - the rest of the challenge is just a matter of endurance and achievment greed. (i was greedy)It wouldn't even be the worst game - but the name totally destroys it for me. Codemasters is now obviously doing same things like EA :(			",1115,429,66,128,171,15,223

												SHORT VERSION: This is a very lean game. Don't get me wrong. It's not a BAD game, but it isn't stellar.  There are much better racing games you can get at this price (or even lower)  (such as Sonic and All Stars Racing Transformed, Blur, Need for Speed Most Wanted 2012, Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2010, Need for Speed the Run, and the Dirt series.LONGER VERSION:The entire game is pretty much time trials by yourself. Unfortunately you don't see your oponnents' cars. Each stage offers a different layout, but to advance to a different area, you have to play stages in the same area like 10 times. I got bored looking at the same environment and playing alone without AI cars.Controls feel just like the cars in the DiRT series, which is good. Your car becomes damaged if you bump into debris and trees. After like 2 races, you're given an option to make a limited number of repairs. With the limited ""repair time"" you must strategically choose which parts of the car you want to repair.Because of the slow progression through the game (it takes forever to see the different environments), and innability to see opponent cars or race alongside opponents, I cannot recommend this game at this price point. There are far better and fully fleshed-out games that can be purchased for about $5 which are much more fun.			",173,7,12,10,5,1,9

												It's not bad, but it ain't great either. It's a fun race game to play on a laptop or a low-end computer, but it's nothing compared to any other Colin McRae game. The price is also a little high for what it is but if you can pick it up for a few bucks while it's on sale, I'd say sure why not.			",361,63,14,31,48,5,48

												PLNa wstępie gratuluję każdej osobie , która na była tę grę na promocji 80% czy tam 90% zniżki, bo tyle ta gra jest warta .Jeśli ktoś lubi magię powinien w to zagrać, auto potrafi,latać-w dodatku tor lotu samochodu zależy od jego humoru . Nie umywa się „to coś” do oryginalnego colina 2. Tak naprawdę są tu tylko  trzy kraje i cztery samochody na całą grę. Przejście kariery polega na przechodzeniu tego samego z coraz bardziej „śmiesznymi’ czasami na odcinkach. Mówiąc wprost przechodzimy około sześć razy te same trzy kraje, czasami tylko w innej kolejności. Z nowych rzeczy jest tylko grafika poprawiona i dodany efekt rozmycia. Ode mnie jako fana colinów i ogólnie zręcznościówek 3/10 Pozdrawiam Codemasters bardziej się nie dało schrzanić gry ;)ENGAt the outset, I congratulate every person who purchased the game on the promotion of 80% or 90% discount there, because so much the game is worth If somebody likes magic should play it, the car can fly-in addition the flight path of the car depends on its humor . Not a patch on ""something"" to the original colina 2. In fact, there are only three countries and four cars for the entire game. Career transition is to transition the same with more and more ""funny"" sometimes stretches. Put simply go about six times the same three countries, sometimes just in a different order. With new things only improved graphics and added blur effect. From me as a fan colinów and generally arcade 3/10 greet Codemasters more could not screw up the game;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recommend this game if you catch it at a deep discount. It is what it is: A Budget title that gives you a decent (arcade) taste of the Rally genre. This is a light game with decent graphics and performance. For the $1-3 i recommend you pay it is worthwhile. Codemasters has many exellent titles out there, and some are more of a sim experience than others. The original Colin McRae Rally was a masterpiece of it's time. A good looking, difficult, detailed simulation experience. DO NOT expect that here, but having a lighter more accessible title in the franchise isn't all bad. Enjoy the good, the bad, and the silly physics in this light, cheap, but fun game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												With all the bad reviews, i was a bit concerned, that this is really dog****.But it turned out to be quite fun.It is not an overly immersive game, nor does it require any big skills. It's just driving, nothing more. No strategies, no pushing others out of the way, just you, your car and the....well track.This game is good for some simple driving without attachments to pass a few minutes before dinner is ready.If you're looking for big choices like what tires to put on, what adjustments to the car to make and alike, look somewhere else.I give it a thumbs up because of its simplicity, though i can understand the people, who wish for something more detailed and immersive.

												Dont not listen to these children who only have a review vocabulary of 2 words, framerate and port. Every time a game that happens to be a mobile game too comes out they harp on about it being a port and make themselves look an idiot for causing a fuss over the label that applies to how the game was made. Is it a good game? Why cant people just give a yes or no answer without comparing it to previous releases in a series or moaning about their framerate or comparing it to a version of the same game on another sytem?We are talking about Colin Macrae Rally for the PC here, not the mobile version so it is irrelevant to this steam purchase.Now that thats all over with I think this is a really good game. It must be coming up to 10 years since Colin Macrae died and no of the kidsies nowadays are going to know who he is/was so its a little strange this brand is continuing.			",44,2,4,0,17,0,2

												I've seen a bunch of negative reviews for this game... I do not know if you have VERY poorly running PCs, a version of Windows that runs this badly, or got a snagged file or three in your downloads, but this game looks pretty awesome for what it is, has zero popup, & zero drawin EVER... (something those retro games the negative reviews say this game is not like, but this is far superior to in all the ways that I care about) Do yourself a favor, & set the launchers' graphics to low, but the highest rez possible, high has so much blurring that it not only eats framerate, it looks awful, & I got the feeling that I needed glasses all of the sudden on high, yeah it's THAT blurry, on low the textures look okay enough, & as I said there's no visual artifacts like stuff suddenly popping into the distant view, or texture drawins... As for the handling? Well if you fancy yourself as a hip Rallycross player, turn sensitivity down (unless it's too low straight off, Mine defaulted max), & turn the deadzone ALL the way down... this even makes the cars pull to the side a tiny bit when they shift gears, JUST like cars do on real loose surfaces like gravel/sand. If you fancy yourself as a casual rally player leave sensitivity maxed, & put deadzone 1, or 2 from the lowest setting, this negates the cars pulling to the side when they shift (except in the VERY odd circulstance when you're shifting, & jumping/cresting in 1st-3rd gears, & when that does happen don't hit a tree)If you aren't quite sure exactly what the meaning of the word fancy is... go play NFS yah Yankee! No seriously then you can turn deadzone up really high, which makes the game play/run so smoooth, it almost looks like it's getting a better framerate (the camera is just jerking about less).The tracks in the game all play/look JUST like real rally tracks should (yes up very close SOME of the many kinds of trees, & about 1/2 of the bushes seem to have fuzzy textures (on low, I don't play on high it gave Me motion sickness!), but you spend 99% of your time near the middle of the road, & in high rez that looks pretty darn good, & no popins (Marry?), the turns/hills/etc. are done VERY well (the 1st Championship is VERY easy, straight, & even bland looking tracks, keep playing m'kaaaaaay)The physics in the game? I dunno if peoples Phys-X/Active-X is flarmed up, or they have other issues, but they're dead on except for the fact that the car pivots on an axis like a top, but devs do this because they may look odd from a 3rd person view, from inside the car [more on that...] it ""feels"" more like a car traversing a loosly surfaced plane. so if you use 2 of the 3 views you'll prob have zero objections to the physics, from the follow the car view it looks pretty artificial turning, drifting etc. {*note to devs* A tighter tail camera clears this up a bit} The game has 3 views... the follow the car view, which is like any other game has, the hood view (bonnet) which lots of even modern games don't bother drawing the dang hood on, this does, & it damages in real time, & the inside car view (cockpit), which is like other games except this oddly has the body of the driver, & steering wheel gone, so it feels a little wierd at 1st, but works well, & once you start focusing on the road/navigator... Myself as with almost all racing games am very happy with this games hood viewI haven't beaten the game yet, so I cannot speak to bugs/glitches in later cars/tracks, but with like 28% unlocked (2 cars, & bunch'a tracks/variations) I haven't experienced any launch/play/control glitches Myself.I also think those people surely must not have actually spent much time playing 1st gen Rally games, or even PS1 Colin McRae, because everything in this game is superior to that game for sure. No splitscreen, no multiplayer, boo hooooooo! Then you hotseat with your friends, taking turns, & noting the times... That's how We did it on LOTS of older games that lacked even splitscreen, so the store claiming this to be retro goodness is 100% correct! (No sorry no demo derby, tag, soccer, or any of the other goofy modes you guys are spoiled with now in other recent rally games)If you have tons of cash, a monster PC, & want the worlds bestest rally experience, then Steam has about 5 better ones, BUT if you're stuck using a slow/cruddy PC like I am (for awhile *sigh*), & Like rally games, or racing in general... $7 bucks ain't to much to ask, & if it's on sale? (I just got Mine for like $1.60 I think) then it's well worth it!Note I'm using Windows 8.1 which has trouble running some stuff, AND a very slow, cheap laptop... if My PC will run this game, yours should too! Using X360 for Win pad (works great)			",133,4,24,8,9,1,1

Yeah, the game is not worth 7 euros if we realize that there are only 4 cars, a few tracks, no car customizability (actually it's OK with me, cuz I don't like the deep fine-tune ♥♥♥♥♥; that's why I didn't like NFSU2 - even that customizability was too much for me, I'm a driver, not a mechanic, but some base things, like the tuning concept in the 2005's NFS: MW would be welcome), no multiplayer mode and yeah, it's technically outdated for PC standards (which is not a problem for me, cuz I gladly play classic games as well as newer ones and I'm not bothered by the older graphics at all), BUT IT IS A GOOD LI'L ARCADE RALLY GAME. And I love arcade driving. The whole game feels like the Colin McRae Rally 2.0 (15 yrs old game and it still rocks, chills my bones - I love this episode so much), but less than that. I read in other comments that the game is unplayable, it has bad or worst controls, controller is useless, blah-blah-blah. Bull-shiat! I have an 11 years old Saitek Impact X6-38V joypad (so not a ""shiny"" and overpriced XBox360 controller) and the driving goes like a charm (don't check my screenshots, they're just for fun). I really enjoy this game, so F U, negative reviews!			",1198,239,58,94,64,12,87

												Colin McRae. Another racing game that tracks achievements. Graphics seem a bit dated, but overall, okay. Controller support isn't ideal, so a keyboard will have to suffice for these who can't deal with partial controller support.Recommended.			",97,2,5,4,1,0,0

												If you want a nostalgic rally game, or something to fill in time between DiRT releases, this is defintely a good buy. Otherwise, don't buy it and you might as well stop reading here.As a whole game, it barely stands up with a few glitches in places, and some very repetitive rally stages (I've only found there to be 3 different countries so far). But the experience from this game is more of a reason to buy it. Essentially it feels like the rally games from 10 years ago (partly because it is) but the touch-ups in the remake allow it to feel and look how it does in your memory. This game does what it sets out to perfectly, it lets you relive the old games, without too many of the hassles involved in installing and setting up to work with controllers.As for the actual gameplay, the difficulty level is fairly easy and all the competitors times are pre-determined. The stage progress bar up the top (straight from the old rally games) bears no reference to whats happening on the track for your competitors, and only shows average speed of the lead CPU (Colin Mcrae in every race). When driving, you get the familar pace notes, although they are mostly accurate, relying on them too heavily will cause an accident. Things like sudden hairpins, jumps immediately before corners, and the pace notes only being 30-70m ahead of you make for some very reaction oriented driving (especially in Australia...). Damage is taken fairly easily in the cars, with even crash free stages short causing quite severe damage by the time you get in for repairs, making the 30 minutes for repairs quite strategic. When you crash (you will), the damage to power and suspension is the most noticeable, followed by the wheels, making you have to dynamically change driving styles mid-race (momentum is key with a ruined engine.) If you're expecting a fully fledged game, that will give you an engaging storyline, or even a new experience, don't buy this game. If you're after a relaxed drive down memory lane, and this game is on sale, I highly recommend it. Pros - Takes you back to the rally games of ten years ago. Works flawlessly with Xbox 360 Controller.More emphasis on better driving, rather than speed.Damage and repairs is a nice change.Cons - Invisible walls just of the edge of the track in some places.Pace notes not always accurate or timely. I crashed in the middle of the road, into the road at one point. Rolling the car doesn't result in immediate car reset. Not much variety in rally stages.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's quite astonishing what a handfull of shaders, some motion blur and a bit of bloom can do to a very old game. Based on he graphics alone you would be really hard pressed to say this game was originally released almost 20 years ago.I have played all the Colin McRae series, have mostly gived up on them since they became Dirt, but this edition does justice to the franchise. It is simply beautiful, drives very good and has enough features to be fun. Obviously the gameplay and interface is basic and it does behave like a very old game, but if you like the feel of older games and want to replay it on a much newer system it's worth a try. Even based on the full price its far superior to anything you would get in your favorite cerial box.Update: After doing my research yes, it seems to be a mobile game port and the original is different.Stil, considering the prince and all, I stil like the game.

												Colin McRae Rally is a good game, but you have to considering the games age.Graphics are OK but quite monotone. No fancy cities, just some landscapes in Australia, Greece and Corsica.There are only four cars in the game but driving is fun and demands a lot of concentration.What's really good is the damage model. Driving carefully is paramount, if you don't you wont win the later championships.You should not pay more than three bucks for the game, either if it's Euro, Pound or Dollars.For a cheap price the game deserves a recommendation.I paid 6,90 Euros which, after finishing the game, I consider too much, but nevertheless I do not regret my purchase. I had fun.			",213,74,13,29,8,1,33

												This game is a lot like DiRT. Except it's more of a pure arcade racer. There's no confusing car customization or tuning. You just pick a car and drive. The visual/audio navigator directions are lower quality then other rally games but they server the purpose of simulating a navigator and are good enough to help the driver run faster. The handling characteristics are super simple and dumbed down. Hardly any need to use the brakes or accelerator with any modicum of finesse. Just barrel into a corner and, voila!, the car drifts itself. I would reccomend this game to someone who wants to have an arcade-style and very simple rally racing experience. I would NOT reccomend this game to someone looking for flashy graphics, or a ""driving simulator"" type experience because really this game doesnt have a lot to offer beyond ""vroom vroom"" but it's only $7 so what do you want?As for the ""HD remake fraud"" comments on a lot of reviews: Check the screen caps, check the trailers. What you see is what you get people.			",42,3,1,3,8,0,3

												My childhood has been reimagened with the new Colin McRae. The classic rally racer has remastered graphics, still keeping the classic graphics but in a more modern way. This game is great, but there are a few issues that I have with it, but a quick feature update will fix them.1: Replays, I did a sick tumble and I wish I could relive it in slo mo.2: Too easy, I like easy games, but it seems too easy.3: Needs more, in cars and tracks.Now to my happy pros that really help make you forget the cons real easy.1: Cool that its fully funtional with steam, including trading cards and achivements2: Graphics fully revamped, but still has the classic touch.3: Codemasters have taken some good use of Unity, using it to the max.4: Runs on pretty low hardware specs.5: The game itself is AWESOME!6: CHEAP! CHEAP! CHEAP!For a 7$ game, its really fun and would reccomend to any classic gamers or race lovers anytime.			",204,21,19,15,25,2,20

												Oh does this game bring back some fond memories. It's one of those games that got me into racing games personally and from what I've played I have nothing but good things to say about it.First off, great remastering effort. Runs on unity so it supports 1440p+/120hz setups without stuffing about. Seems to have wheel support but currently untested, gamepad works a treat. Co-driver is well voiced and has perfect timing with the corners. Car handling itself feels similar to grid (arcade) but has some nice drift on the corners. Bunch of official cars to unlock as you progress through the championships which starts off in my stomping ground, Australia.Nitpicking for 'modern day racers' it is missing a couple of things. None of which bothers me. Multiplayer, replays, vehicle tuning, track 'map' displays and ability to change from mph to kph.Views Available: Rear, Bonnet, Cockpit (quite basic as expected but works)It is exactly as you remember it. Nice clean no mess no fuss rally racing action. Well worth every cent, just don't expect the options you might find in games like grid/dirt. :)			",4107,1606,205,507,690,51,637

												I look back fondly at the older CMR games, and this fits well with them.It does feel outdated, but is otherwise a fine game. For a fiver you can't really go wrong!If I do have one complaint, it's that the gear changes feel delayed and clunky. I started off in automatic transmission, where it would randomly stick in a gear i didn't want to be in. Switched to manual hoping that would solve the issue, but if anything it got worse. Wouldn't change up or down when needed, such as tricky hairpin bends. Not something you want from a rally game.Otherwise though, sublime in every other way. Also nice to see codemasters not forgetting about their older games7/10			",67,3,8,4,7,2,2

												I have only played 37 mins (according to Steam) so this is an initial review for anyone, like me, who could not resist getting an old Colin McRae Rally on Steam. It certainly feels similar to playing the old game, and I feel like I recognise the tracks from my days spent on CM1 and 2.0. I would hesitantly recommend this as I have enjoyed my first few runs on it. However, there are a few issues. I have struggled to get my controller to behave as I would like. I can select keys or buttons but cannot change the analogue stick. Consequently I have to push left to accelerate and right to brake. I had a few hairpins where I ""whacked on the brake"" and actually accelerated into a crash. Also crests appear to cause my car to roll over several times. The next issue is the ""difficulty"". While getting used to the controller I decided to do the first Championship consisting of six tracks. Despite my crashes and rolls I won with a total of just under 19 minutes with the second place getting just under 26 minutes. I really ought to have to at least get good before winning, and never by that much!However, I enjoyed playing and it felt nostalgic. I certainly like the idea of some old classics being ""remastered"" for modern computers, and at a good price too. I look forward to a remastered Cannon Fodder... (hint hint)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros:- Takes me back to the childhood. Seriously who dont know this game at 2000, and played it a LOT :)- The graphics are the same and new, jeez, i like it!! Well, the Unity engine does the job pretty well!- Worth every penny, if you are an addict to this type of game!- The Co-Pilot Sound is almost the same, but in a good way- I like achievementsCons:- No replay, at the end of the stage.- No fine tuning option, best part of the game at the CMR2.0 imo.- Controls are horrible... well not that much but its not good as the CMR2.0 have- It's like you pushing the gas pedal to the limit but the car feels moving very slowly.- It's too easy- Lack of cars, and stages.. More than the half content are missing fromt he original CMR2.0.- MIssing the inside camera option (It does have but not like CMR2.0) :(- Am I missing the MPH/KMH option at the menus?Summ:Theres an IPhone version of this game. I dont have an iPhone, but the videos and the controls, and the engine whispers to me we have a port of a mobile game. Sad or not, thats you decide.For myself i can easily say worth every penny, because, what i sad before, its part of my childhood :)Anyway respect for Codemasters, for renewing this title and hopefully in a small update will cure the problems (physics, camera, fine tuning)But for the nostalgia i'll give a 6/10.

												A fun arcade-style rally racing game, I'm glad to see a Colin McRae Rally game back on Steam. This is a game what I've played very much when in my childhood, so when I saw this game I've directly bought it.I must say, I'm not disappointed about this game. Still the repairs in the game, trees which won't get out of your way, small boundaries near the track, and the most ridiculous crashes are still there. Only the biggest Con which also has been mentioned by other players, there is no replay function in the game :(Pros:- The further you are in the championship the harder it gets- Original Cars and Sounds, even the navigator has the same sounds- The Oldschool gaming feeling comes backCons:- No Replay's- Sometimes there are some jumps which causes crashes which costs to much time.After All;For a small price you will have a lot of fun, and you will get back some childhood memories!

Introduction:First of all the low price tag should be an indication of what to expect, an arcade racing game. Don't expect an next-gen rally game. This is a ""raw rally racing game"".  Pros: Has full racing experience. Has a quite dynamic car damage system.Straight forward.No bugs/glitches.Performance Optimized.Good effects here and there.Optimized for gamepads and wheels.Cons:Very low texture and edge quality.Not much custom features.No real story or goals.The games funky handling appears every once in a while. Conclusion:If you enjoy racing and want a chill game this is a good choice. You can sit back drive classic rally cars and cruise through simple tracks, This is basically an IOS game transferred to the PC platform.For more reviews check out  Original Curators Group  ",84,12,10,9,25,1,2

												FIrst of all: This is the EXACT game you can find on Android and I presume other mobile platforms. That being said, the game still delivers a lot of satisfaction.I recently bought the Android version. I had mixed feelings about it; especially the touch screen controls - they suck period.I imagined how much better the game will play with a gamepad controller like the xbox 360. And here it is!!I've only played the Australian Rally so far, but the game is solid. So much better with a gamepad.What it is: If you love rally games you will like this game. It has good control mechamism and the graphics are fairly good for the size of the game. You don't need a high end pc to play this. It's not too difficult or too easy. Damage your car and you'll notice the difference. You have steam achievements and trading cards. You  get the old school rally sound and commentary without drift and annoying commentary found in the latest codemasters games.The price is right for what you get.What it's not: You can't compare this to the Dirt series or Grid series. This was initially developed for mobile so the standards are not there. Original Colin Mcrae - you will never have that again in my opinion.Pros: Highly enjoyable, fun and nostalgic gameCons: Not able to modify the cars and some bugs in the sound and commentary (same in the mobile game)If you support this game, perhaps codemasters will realise we still and always will love original rally games and they will release a top quality product again in the coming years.....

												It aint the original thats for sure, first thing i noticed was there was no ghost car to race against, just a little bar showing how your oppenent did time wise, so you cant watch how a really good run goes down, and watching your oppenent race is a very usefull thing to know when to brake, drift,speed up, etc. The controlls feel pretty good,graphics are okay, but overall its pretty lean. Even the way they do the menu and how you select stuff is basic and mundane. They need to do a new Mcrae more like the originals, this is a watered down version of what this franchise use to be...but hey , you get what you pay for, and at the price, if you played it back in the day, you might as well give it a try			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun arcade-style rally racing game, I'm not actually sure which games this HD remastered content comes from - but I'm glad to see a Colin McRae Rally game on Steam, thanks Codemasters.Update: The content is from Colin McRae Rally 2.0 and the game runs on the Unity Engine.Update 2: Turns out the game is a port of a Mobile game that includes a select portion of the content from CMR 2.0, it isn't a full HD remake of that game and includes 4 cars and 3 rallies.Despite all this, I still recommend the game: It's good fun for what it is and IMO is worth the asking price - but please don't buy it expecting the full CMR 2.0 experience, you'll be disappointed.

												I recommend this game only cause it really feels like Xbox Live Arcade game for a decent price.  There is quite a few issues that others have already complained about which include the following.-bad controls - which can be fixed in the options-bad graphics - the amazing cardboard cutouts from the old game remain while the car, shadows and lighting are the only real HD and the game is built with Unity Engine- 4 cars and 3 continents -for $6.99 I don't feel like its a complete rip off-mobile port - a lot of complaints about that but I don't feel its the worse mobile port- no multiplayer - this truly is a disappointment- no ai cars on track - the only type of race in the game is you vs the AI Clock it does sound bad but its a short game so there isn't anything really to hype about here- bad physics - this truly is another bad disappointment but if its not something your looking to get angry at then this will be the least of your worries So if your expecting a big amazing game pay the 20 dollars to get other Codemasters titles cause what your getting here is a simple skimmed down Arcade racer for $6.99.  Don't expect anything bigger enjoy this little game.			",445,74,49,20,19,6,33

												I don't care how much you all hate titles developed in UNITY and released on multiple platforms. I'm having alot of fun with this. The original had NO cockpit view so this is a new and welcome ADDED feature. No this is NOT ported from a mobile title. It is content from the old game, reworked in HD with the UNITY engine. Your android thingus isn't running this in 2560x1440 with 8x MSAA on like I am. The XBOX360 controller works great and is much better than the Dual Analogue I played the original with. This is a classic, made better in every way and then released on multiple platforms for couch cushion money. 30 stages in 5 rallies with 4 different cars. Would I like more cars and more rallies? Sure. But then we wouldn't be paying less than the DLC for most modern games cost for it would we? Hate if you want to hate, but don't believe negative ""reviews"" from people who haven't played it, or are mad that it is available for other platforms.The AI is easy in the first few rallies and begins to get tough in the first Corsica Rally. The 2nd Greece is competent but after that they get strong.			",538,76,53,107,102,6,203

												Reminds me of the old PS1 days. If you started racing with newer generations you may not like it, but if you grew up with racers through the ages it's a fun jaunt through memory lane and loads quickly enough to be very casually played in short bits, unlike the great majority of racers which have a bunch of logo screens, fmvs, elaborate menus, and long load times. Makes a good ""racing snack"" with some nostalgia factor.			",443,126,41,62,40,5,71

												Doesn't work with PS4 controller. You can't clear control settings and can only bind it to a different button. Trying to bind it to the anolog triggers the car continusly accelerates and brakes when pulling the accellerate trigger. You can't assign brake and accelerate to any of the face buttons except for the d pad. Stupid.Also tried with a 360 controller same problem, you cannot bind the any of the acceleration commands to the triggers.I was declined the refund that was offered until the 19th that was not properly made aware to the buyers of the game.

												This game is such a poor excuse for a remaster and a release in general. It's a remaster of Colin McRae Rally 2.0 (still don't understand why is it called just Colin McRae Rally instead of Colin McRae Rally 2.0 Remastered), but it lacks more than half of the content from the original game. You get to choose from only 4 cars (Ford Focus, Subaru Impreza, Mitsubishi Lancer and Lancia Stratos), 3 of them you have to unlock. There's only 3 countries (Australia, Greece and Corsica, originaly called France), so you get to race only on three types of surfaces - sand, tarmac and gravel. No mud, no snow, no ice. All the races happen during sunny day, which is the only weather condition in the entire game. No night, no rain, no storm, no snowing, no clouds etc. The game is an arcade just like the original, but the driving model is kinda weird. Almost any bigger jump is almost impossible to land in a higher speed, instead you always crash and roll, because the car behaves like if it was made out of rubber. Besides all that the game is also missing the Arcade mode, there's no multiplayer at all, you can't setup the car and you can repair only four things. The game is a port of a mobile version, so the menus look really simple and as for the graphics (since this is a remaster) it's basically just a resolution upscale with few added effects. And yes, I spent 9.6 hrs on this game, because that's approximately how much it will take you to finish all championships, after that there's no reason to play the game any more.

												One quesion...one efing question. Why are there closed ""gates"" about 40 ft after the end of some stages? You know to get good times you try to be fast. But if your too fast at the end there, your car is going to crash head on against the stage, before the game fades to black. Seriously the last sound asset playing was the bursting of my windshields. I found it funny at first, but not so much, when I realized that the (significant) damage actually transferred to the next stage. Which caused my car to be waaay to loose on the track and me to not possibly be able to defend my lead (I won the first 3 stages before that). Thats ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Do you see a 40ft leeway to stop in any actual rally? I mean WHY? I bought CM Rally despite the bad reviews and, as you can see on my playtime and stage time rankings, thouroughly enjoyed it. I thought well its arcady, but at least there is a real competition to getting the tracktimes and sensible racing lines within the stage. But this prior explained issue (its not a bug, its existence is just ♥♥♥♥ing stupid) ruined my recent play session AND my expert rally championship.P.S. This being said, I enjoyed this, somehow, more than Dirt 2. Finally I want to ask if Dirt Rally will be coming to Mac OS. It would be nice not to rant about a game which is based on a more than 10 year old engine but do Hillclimb.Oh and seriously AUS 1 SS 4 and AUS 2 SS 2 ( i believe) have the most awkward jumps to them. haha the physics engine is struggling with those ones.

												Summary: This game is a disgrace and it doesn't deserve Colin's name in it's title.Pros:- i got it for the price of a sandwich ($2)...i wish i'd get the sandwich instead.Cons:- physics -> be prepared to flip your car multiple times while jumping and also while driving on straight road...i know it's an arcade, but hey, even Mario Kart got better physics.- opponents cheating -> you finish 1 second behind the winner and stats screen shows you almost 10 seconds behind (even at stage 1 races). They're also invincible and suffer no damage/speed penalties at all.- Unity -> damn, a rich dev/publisher like Codemasters can't afford a better engine? Why didn't they use any from their older CMR's or Dirt games? Oh right, that would mean they'd need to do something more than just recompiling the ARM mobile version to x86.- a lot more, but the game just isn't worth enough for writing it downIf you want the real CMR experience, get anything from 1 to 2005 or any Dirt and stay away from this; if you still want it because of the price - forget it and get Xpand Rally. It's 11 years old, looks better, got more tracks, better handling and got more in common with our well-known CMR franchise than this disappointment of a game.			",1295,547,64,172,182,14,267

												I won't say that this game is fantastic but it is like a nostalgia trip. It looks like these old Colin McRae games from the first half of 2000's but there is nothing special AT ALL. There is no special content, no multiplayer (even local) and even the main menu looks lame. I would recommend it if it was made a lot earlier but it was made pretty recently and there are a lot better racing games out there in the Internet and Steam right now.RATING: 4/10 ""Got bored after 1 hour of straight playing!""

												Fun, but the launch physics are so bad it's laughable. For example: Try to hit a jump at speed, Car vaults straight up and flips end over end. Might be a glitch. Reset and start again. Hit same jump. Car just barrel rolls like it was tossed by an angry toddler. The throttle and reverse is also about as unresponsive as I've ever seen in a game. Why am I going so slowly? It's because the game hasn't switched you up a gear yet and it's been redlining for 10 seconds. Hit a tree and need to reverse? Go and make a sammich before reverse finally engages.

												This game does look like a port from a mobile game. The graphics is quite nice, and doesn't require strong hardware. The interface is stripped down to allow quick access to matches. However, customizability is limited. The object model is simplified. Car selection and track selection is limited and repetitive. This game is really for the casual gaming when you just want to play a few races and win without serious effort. Not recommend as a racing game. They should charge no more than $3.

												Even on Steam sale I wanted my money back. If you are not familiar with this, this game is a mobile port of Colin McRae Rally to PC and it is not worth the money.For a PC port, the driving dynamics are flawed compared to the original CMR 2.0. You have horrendous understeer every time you want to attack a corner unless you use the handbrake but really it drops the car's momentum and you have to face the unbearable by watching your car slowly climb back up to top speed.The physics are also bad because the suspension model makes the car absorb the shock and pre load your car into the air sending it crashing.Though I know this is a port and I love Codemasters very much, they should have kept this title only exclusive for mobile phones.

												By today's standards (2014-2016) Sega Screamer Rally 2 (1996), Network Q RAC (1996) and Need For Speed 2 (1997) are better games in all respects, including the graphics details. This game is a junk in every category. The $7 price tag (today Jan-09-2016) is about 10 times higher than what it should be. Actually, it's not worth playing for free.People who say that this is a port of a mobile phone game are only partially correct. It is a mobile phone game, just that it's a bad one. Just watch Asphalt 8 on youtube and make a comparison.Instead of describing what is wrong with the game, I shall focus on what is good: Nothing.  ",504,143,32,91,66,5,117

												  Personal Score: 6.5 out of 10  This game is the casual version of the master piece Colin Mcrae 2.0 that was out in 2000, with that in mind i kind of loved and hated it. While playing i was allways thinking how great was the old game, and this one falls out short but when you finish the campaign you get a little light of hope in a message that codemasters thinks in adding more content later.  This game has 3 countries you play in, Australia, Greece and France ( Corsica), the first two are mostly gravel and the last one is all tarmac and you can somehow feel the difference between them.  You can choose between four cars Ford Focus, Subaru Impreza, Mitsubishi Lancer and a RWD Lancia Delta which didnt feel like it and was also the best car in the game since it was the only one with good acceleration. The Subaru and Mitsubishi felt like they had autobreak on, im quite sure the suspencion was made out of rubber because the cars were jumping all over the road.  I recommend it because is play and drive and close to the game base but there is a lot of content missing.			",181,20,22,18,7,2,5

If you are looking for a fun ray game that it pretty realistic this is NOT the game, and if you don't want the $50 price tag of dirt rally then I highly reccomend dirt 3. If is a very fun game with fairly good physics good graphics that runs well for about $13. It is worth the $7 extra. As for this game it is a port from mobile and it has pretty crappy control as well as less then decent graphics a very minimalistic UI and hard levels that make it very hard to progress in the game, it is also Getty repetitive and for me honastly was a somewhat boring experience after the first hour and a half.

												When I bought this I thought it was the original Colin McRae Rally. When I started playing it, it looked like the 2nd one, and had the same stages. But none of the awesome feeling that game had. Yeah, I got it at 80% so I didn't bother reading the description. Still, having a CMR (2014) or something as title would've helped.If you're looking to bring back some fond memories, stay away from this one, it's terrible.			",11,2,23,1,3,0,6

												While this game is nothing to rave about, I definitely don't really agree with all of the negative reviews it has received. Though, I am a newcomer to the game/rally genre, so that could be why.The first time I played the game, I was unaware that it was a rerelease of a mobile title; That being said, I'm still having a moderate amount of fun with it.The textures are definitely lacking (though by no means horrible), the menu music is the same 5 second loop endlessly repeated, the game has a moderate handful of tracks (though admittedly, still only a handful) based on 3 regions, and only 4 cars to choose from, 3 of which are only usable after unlocking by placing first in certain championships, and none of which are even slightly customizable.Though again, for a mobile title ported over to PC, most of this can be overlooked. As a newcomer to rally, this game came with a little bit of a learning curve, but after a few races I got used to the handling of the cars (more accurately the lack of handling), and now I find it really fun drifting through hairpin turns at high speeds.I do wish the game was a bit longer though, even from a mobile port. I've clocked about 5 hours of play time at the time of writing this, and I have three of the four cars unlocked, and only two more championships until I ""finish"" the game. This game may not be able to hold it's ground against many of the modern, more in-depth console/PC racing titles out there, but for the few bucks this game costs, it's definitely not a horrible game. If you're looking for a cheap, quick, simple, decently fun rally game, Colin McRae Rally is definitely worth a quick look. 3/5			",356,78,13,34,14,3,20

												Colin MCRae rally on pc or consoles is one of my favourite series when i want to play rally, and this seems only to have been converted from phones for the money. The real original rally  on pc  is so much better. Being a pc gamer iam spoiled with quality from Codemasters and Milestone S.r.l.  (Milestone is responsible for WRC 1-2-3-4.)Some short brief, first the good stuff:Original voice actor.Cars look ok and gives me some short flashes from the old days. ;)And now the bad stuff:Cars seems to be really low on horsepowers. Giving full throttle should give more juice on those wheels.Cars seems to glide on ice on all surfaces.Cars fly or roll on jumps like crazy.Car damage is as simple as 1999. Just see for yourself if you get it.The scenery of the tracks are boring and simple.Music is repeative and boring after 2hrsPlease Codemasters dont ruin such a famous gem as Colin MCRae Rally with these low cost ports from phones. Next time add alot more for it being worth to get on pc. Yes we want more because we know you can deliver. If you enjoy simple arcade racers with not so hard achivements and steamcards give it a go on sale. I gave it a go and can enjoy it for short bursts but thats all. Its not super bad but not good either.			",583,134,18,134,88,7,141

Product received for free
												Won this in a Twitter giveaway; I gotta say, even though I have fond memories of doing very badly at Colin McRae Rally 2.0 growing up, I still got a good deal of enjoyment from this. If you treat it as its own thing (albeit one that rampantly reuses assets from plenty of previous games), it's a pretty enjoyable arcade-style rally racer, one that's not as punishing as the original series (for better or for worse). A lot of the sponsors are rather anachronistic, there's only two kinds of surfaces, and the six championships are just shuffled around to make for ""more"" events.Events are simple time-based affairs. There's no actual in-race opponents; a bar at the top tracks your position compared to your best-performing opponent (pretty much always Colin McRae himself), and the race against the clock tends to be rather satisfying once you've gotten the rhythm down. Like I said, it's a lot less punishing; I don't know if I've actually gotten extremely better over the years since or if it's significantly easier, but considering I was able to recover from some rather galling cuts and significant wrecks without issue, it seems to be the latter.Maintaining vehicle damage is simplified to the point that it's easy to keep track of, but still tricky to balance. You can only repair so much before heading back out onto the track, and even a perfect run will cause some routine wear. Different vehicles do feel properly distinct, making the small pool of choices a bit more understandable, and when I went for a certain outdated classic, I found that it realistically got smashed to bits far, far easier than its more modern counterparts. You'll learn to recognize - and loathe - the sound and effect of each particular point of failure. Especially suspension.The original store listing definitely deserves the infamy it got. This isn't the original Colin McRae Rally at all (nor is it the sequel that it pulls all of its content from). It's a small sampling of cars and courses from that game given a semi-new coat of paint. As is said of many titles on Steam, it's one of those ""worst version of a great game"" kind of things. In the end, though, I found myself really, really enjoying it. It was kind of hilariously disappointing when the end screen told me to look forward to new cars and tracks in upcoming updates; with the reception this has gotten, that's never happening. This'll remain a grim reminder to be clear with your advertising, and a fun little diversion for those looking for a small spot of classic point-to-point rally.			",202,57,48,14,17,5,10

												When this game first appeared on steam it was described as an HD remake of Colin McRae Rally 2.0 and I decided to buy it as soon as it was on sale. By the time it was on sale it was apparent that this was in fact a PC port of the mobile game based upon Colin McRae Rally 2.0 and it had loads of negative reviews. In the end I still bought it because even if it is a cut down version I still wanted to play it to relive the fond memories of the original game.My first thought when I started the game was isn't this supposed to have updated graphics? After a look at screen shots of the original I could see the graphics have been updated but it still doesn't look great. I realised at this point that this game does not just need to measure up to the original but to the idealised version in my head coloured by years of nostalgia.To be fair it did have some aspects that lived up to my expectations. The overall driving mechanics are excellent fun (apart from the occasional collision detection glitch that just stops your car). It also has the great damage management aspects of the original what has been lacking from many of more recent dirt games.I am however still going to give this a thumbs down because they have cut so much out in comparison to the original it is not worth it. Most of the cars are gone, most of the tracks are gone, there are no different liveries, no different weather conditions, the car set up is gone and the detailed in car view is gone.

												Boring, repetitive and easy.Just racing against the clock. There is more than one opponent, but it does not make any sense, since Colin McRae is always the fastest opponent and it only matters whether you are in the 1st place or not. Would be passable if it wasn't a time trial but rather a race with other components.			",458,142,12,36,52,8,83

												Not worth at the current price. I got it with humble bundle. ~Terrible UI,~cars feel too floaty and weightless,~ok-ish control with keyboard~Ok graphics for a mobile port but no where near other dirt games.  Unless you get it for super cheap and have nothing to play, don't buy it.			",39,9,2,2,1,0,2

												  Personal Score: 6.5 out of 10  This game is the casual version of the master piece Colin Mcrae 2.0 that was out in 2000, with that in mind i kind of loved and hated it. While playing i was allways thinking how great was the old game, and this one falls out short but when you finish the campaign you get a little light of hope in a message that codemasters thinks in adding more content later.  This game has 3 countries you play in, Australia, Greece and France ( Corsica), the first two are mostly gravel and the last one is all tarmac and you can somehow feel the difference between them.  You can choose between four cars Ford Focus, Subaru Impreza, Mitsubishi Lancer and a RWD Lancia Delta which didnt feel like it and was also the best car in the game since it was the only one with good acceleration. The Subaru and Mitsubishi felt like they had autobreak on, im quite sure the suspencion was made out of rubber because the cars were jumping all over the road.  I recommend it because is play and drive and close to the game base but there is a lot of content missing.			",181,20,22,18,7,2,5

												Actually, I don't mind this game, it gives you a break from todays crap where if your going too fast approaching a croner, no amount of action form the player will change the direction your heading!As for the bland gfx, I culld not give a rats rear end about them!No idea if it has different difficulty setting, but so far, it is easy to win races, which is a bonus to me!Buy it if all you want is an easy racing game that does not require much effort!

												Well as you can see. It's a report of the phone edition. This is it's worst point.It has possibly the worst controls possible. No controller support (But apparently wheel support)It's not worth much at all. Maybe 69pIt's not hard to complete, and I can't even be bothered I'm so ashamed.They might as well just remove it from steam altogether.			",92,16,12,11,23,2,21

												This is a moderately fun arcade (lite) version of the original. It's got the great sound, the graphics are so-so but there is no customization at all. Not even tire selection for the surface conditions. I enjoyed the game having been a huge fan of the original game but would not recommend this to someone who has never played a rally game before. There are far better options out there. Pros:Inexpensive trip down memory laneI think the co-driver in this game is Nicky Grist and that alone almost gives it a positive ratingEasy to complete with minimal effortCons:Zero Car customizationNo point to using the Sub or Mitsu. I used the Focus and the Lancia for the majority of the game.E-brake doesn't do much at all you can cut corners at will. Random Car Flips WTFNote: I used Keyboard only to play. There are some reviews out there that state there isn't keyboard support. I re-mapped the shift keys with no problems. ",37,11,7,7,7,1,6

												While this game is nothing to rave about, I definitely don't really agree with all of the negative reviews it has received. Though, I am a newcomer to the game/rally genre, so that could be why.The first time I played the game, I was unaware that it was a rerelease of a mobile title; That being said, I'm still having a moderate amount of fun with it.The textures are definitely lacking (though by no means horrible), the menu music is the same 5 second loop endlessly repeated, the game has a moderate handful of tracks (though admittedly, still only a handful) based on 3 regions, and only 4 cars to choose from, 3 of which are only usable after unlocking by placing first in certain championships, and none of which are even slightly customizable.Though again, for a mobile title ported over to PC, most of this can be overlooked. As a newcomer to rally, this game came with a little bit of a learning curve, but after a few races I got used to the handling of the cars (more accurately the lack of handling), and now I find it really fun drifting through hairpin turns at high speeds.I do wish the game was a bit longer though, even from a mobile port. I've clocked about 5 hours of play time at the time of writing this, and I have three of the four cars unlocked, and only two more championships until I ""finish"" the game. This game may not be able to hold it's ground against many of the modern, more in-depth console/PC racing titles out there, but for the few bucks this game costs, it's definitely not a horrible game. If you're looking for a cheap, quick, simple, decently fun rally game, Colin McRae Rally is definitely worth a quick look. 3/5			",356,78,13,34,14,3,20
