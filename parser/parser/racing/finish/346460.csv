								TL,DR:hardcore skimmer (compare: multicopter) racing SIMULATION, science fiction setting, difficult but rewarding. deep game.~after playing this game to the death the last few weeks I think it’s time for me to write a review. I keep it short and focus only on points that make this game special to me:the physics and the controls are great, the handling is nuanced, complex and, yeah, I assume: realistic. though it's all science fiction, it really is a simulation. that makes the game hard and unforgiving at the beginning - the learning curve is really pretty steep. but once you get the hang of the controls and learn how to build a skimmer that's to your liking, racing it becomes just glorious.what does racing actually mean? compared to driving a car, the controls are sluggish and imprecise. once something is brought into motion, the momentum keeps it going to certain degree. unnecessary inputs spiral out of control fast, so you really need a light touch, a fluid way of conducting. also: foresight, patience and confidence. if this sounds like a stark contrast to moving through canyons with 1000+kph, that's because it is. that's the main attraction! elegantly turn in for a corner, rotate your nose in the new direction while going sideways at full speed, missing the cliff in front of you by only a hair. crazy on the screen, but try it with a VR set!change in difficulty comes mostly with speed (five classes), but upgrading to a faster machine doesn't necessarily make slower racing less interesting, thanks to the great feeling of the game.tuning and modifying the machine is relatively intuitive and cause and effect seem mostly logical to me. I have spent hours over hours tinkering and tuning my racers, and I'm still a long way from grasping even half of what lies in the details. the futuristic parts and their functionality aren't too far out, it's science fiction, but very close to present day real life. ~I play this game on gnu/Linux (the reason why I found it in the first place), where it runs beautifully  - the performance looks to be better than on win 7 right now, for whatever reasons. playing with a DK2 is incredible, the game is made with VR in mind and it really shows, it's really a must have for VR owners.Red River Studious is easy to reach via the boards, bugfixes come quickly and with good success. a total pro show, that, and a good indication for future support and content.~can compare elements of this game to: F-Zero, WipeOut, Slipstream 5000, Solar Jetman, SW pod racer, Richard Burns Rally~that's it, thanks for reading.best,Michael  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								10/10 would plough cockpit-first into a terraformer againAlright, kids.  This isn't your regular racer.  In this game, you'll fly instead of drive.  Hopefully.  If you're driving, you're doing it wrong.    Gameplay: 9/10Graphics: 7/10Sound: 8/10Is this game worth your money?  Yes.  I rate my steam games by how often my heartrate rises above 100 beats per minute, because those are the games that are the most exciting.  This game's gameplay consists of you feeling like a pro while you race over the planes of Mars, and then feeling like an idiot as you narrowly (read: by a hair's breadth) miss a pile of rocks.  The latter occurs more the faster you try to fly.The gameplay is a blend of traditional racers with realistic physics and the ability to trade alitude for airspeed and vice-versa.  Vector 36 FEELS like a traditional racer with just a little bit more depth to it.  It also runs slower than traditional racers, allowing you to savor the feeling of catching up to your foes.  This draws out the chase & pass sequences rather than leaving them down to some cheap pass-on-the-inside-of-the-corner ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, which is what you'd see in a traditional racer.  The graphics aren't Dices' Battlefront quality, but you don't notice that once you begin racing.  The gameplay is so good that it draws you in past its graphics and into the race.  Vector 36 is immersive WITHOUT lifelike graphics, and that's pretty damn admirable.  I should note that I'm playing on a GTX 650, so to be honest I haven't experienced Vector 36's true graphics quality.  Sound: nothing to report.  It's good.  Excellent, in fact.  Sounds realistic.  Adds to the immersion.  Look, point is, it's good.  You'll enjoy it.  And it's only going to keep getting better.  So...ARE YOU READY FOR A STRATEGIC RACER ON THE SURFACE OF MARS?DO YOU THIRST FOR SOME♥♥♥♥♥CLENCHINGLY TIGHT TURNS, SOME OF WHICH YOU DON'T ACTUALLY PULL OFF?IS IT YOUR DREAM TO BE TOO GREEDY AND DROP TO LAST AFTER CRASHING INTO A CHECKPOINT BECAUSE YOU TRIMMED YOUR SKIMMER TO FLY TOO LOW?ARE YOU THE KIND OF PERSON WHO CONTINUES TO RACE EVEN AFTER YOUR ENGINES CATCH FIRE?DO YOU WANT TO PULL YOUR HAIR OUT WONDERING WHY ALINA LI'S SKIMMER IS SOMEHOW PERPETUALLY BETTER THAN YOURS?IS THE POPE CATHOLIC?!THEN THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!

								This is the game VR headsets are made for. Try it with steam VR or oculus if you get a chance, it's INSANE. Especially when you're going 1000kph, 10 feet off the ground, through clouds of flaming debris, and just barely clipping your wings(?) on the cliffs.I found myself spending more and more time customizing my skimmers once I realized I could make them look and fly pretty much however I want. For higher speed races, it becomes a whole challenge in itself to basically make the fastest manned rocket possible that can still be steered. The interplay of engineering and skill required is really unique, and even though it's only single player right now, the bots are surprisingly competitive. It definitely takes some mastering. Overall it's showing tons of promise... especially for a one-man development team. It's still in the early stages so hopefully we'll see more and more variety down the road. I can't wait for multiplayer, to see (and demolish) other people's hard work!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is made by a single, ex-nasa engineer, using realistic-ish physics.  Racing is all about balancing power between lift and rear thrust for speed/surviving.  It's a bit like a rock skimming across a pond, if that rock had jet engines and rockets on it.Played on my Rift with XB1 controller, using a Nvidia 770 and getting good framerates, though i do lower the settings a little bit.There are some annoying bugs in the garage, but it's early access so hopefully they'll be cleaned up, and haven't found any bugs at all while actually racing.Fun game and want to see it developed more!

								This is a really unique racing game and likely the first one which uses newton physics. It features races across vast, open landspaces in 5 different speed tiers, kinda like the races in star wars.In most racing games you can only steer left + right. In Vector 36 you can also stear up and down + vertically, which also makes the game really challenging and somewhat hard to learn (at first). All skippers also drift alot if you want to turn, which gives it a great feeling.The lower you fly, the faster you are able to skip across the surface, but it is also more dangerous. This is also a great way to prevent people from just flying around freely.You are able to manage your energy distribution in real time while you are racing. Energy is distributed between stabilizators (lift) and engine power. That means the more energy the engine gets, the more challenging it is to get a stable flight. For example, if you set the engine to 100%, you wont even able to jump above a small hill while setting the engines to 20%, you wont even notice the hill because it will auto adjust the height. This will also affect your turn radius.Because of this, you are constantly adjusting your power management.By doing races you get money and are able to buy new skippersl You can also customize your own vehicle, by buying different parts for your skipper. No multiplayer yet, but it is plannedI can realy recommend it if you want a realistic star wars pod racer style game, but I cant realy recommend it for casual gamers, because the game is very hard to learn and first speed tier is realy slow.i give it 9 of 10 points.

								If you like racing games more oriented to the simulation side where you can adjust mostly every little aspect of your racing machine, then you should try this. Vector 36 sets you in a terraformed Mars, where pilots use their racing machines (called Skimmers) to compete on the circuits of the surface of Mars. These Skimmers are hover machines that you can adjust and fine tune to the millimeter. The game is fully physics driven and offers a very complete garage where you can modify your Skimmers, starting from the angles of every lift to configuring even the force and direction of each of them, all in an intuitive way. If you don’t want to wrap your head around all this, that’s fine too! The game has 3 basic Skimmers from different manufacturers that you can purchase and use them as is and they will work perfectly. You have 6 more customized ones in the shop too, so you have where to choose. The game has 6 circuits right now and an array of special races, like weight or engine power limitations, so definitely there is a nice amount of content from the start (and it will just keep growing!). On top of that, this game has support for the VR headsets, which will make your experience even more enjoyable!So, in conclusion, this game is a little gem that deserves more attention and is a good example of how early access games should be done. From the start, it’s perfectly playable and has a nice amount of content for it’s price tag, not like others that aren’t even playable after months of being released on Steam. The game is constantly in development and have regular updates, so I totally recommend Vector 36!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Vector 36 is a hard-science physics driven sci-fi hover sim. It feels like Podracing meets Kerbal Space program, and the polish on the game is pretty intense.Craft customization is deep and rewarding, as every piece of equipment affects weight and balance of the craft, so even something as simple as rearranging your existing components can have a dramatic impact on your craft's performance.It's definitely got a learning curve, but I'm having a blast and I can't put it down.

												(Please check out a full review at thecrankymessiah.com)This game is fantastic.I bought this on a whim and, to be perfectly honest, i didn't even plan on keeping it. I was bored, and i just wanted to play it for an hour or so to see what it was like and then refund it. Because i am a jerk. The next thing i knew, over 3 hours had passed and i was knee-deep in tinkering with my skimmer, trying to get it just right so i could get back to the track and beat the next race.The controls are fantastic. They seem very difficult at first (or at least did to me), and there is definitely a learning curve. But once you get the hang of them (and the physics), which didnt take anywhere near as long as i had feared, they are excellent. It is well worth getting past the initial struggle in order to master them, because once you do this game will make you feel like an absolute bad-a**. Coming down from a jump/bump and tapping your ""lift"" button while pulling your nose up slightly at JUST the right time to narrowly avoid bouncing off the ground and losing speed, or drifting through a turn and barely avoiding an outcropping or pulling up just enough to skim over it by mere inches, is incredibly gratifying. I don't know that i've ever played a racing game that gave me the same feeling of gratification and satisfaction, let alone of just plain making me feel like an awesome pilot/driver. There is a real, tangible sense of improvement and gradual mastery on the part of the player. Every race, i could feel myself getting just a little bit better, or learning cool new ways to handle my skimmer in certain situations and cut down on my time. It is a hovercraft, rather than a car, so expect a bit of floatiness. But not in a bad way. The physics are impressive. It feels a bit unwieldy at first, but trust me that you will be zooming around and expertly drifting through turns in no time.The skimmer customization is also extremely impressive. Changing parts and setting up your skimmer is not simply a matter of swapping out one part and putting another in its place. The customization options and ability to tinker are much more in-depth, and offer a wealth of potential builds. Parts are placed manually, and can be adjusted in myriad ways. Each part has certain areas on the body in which it can be placed, but they don’t simply snap on to some default location. They can be placed anywhere within those areas. And once you decide where to place them, you are far from done. They can be raised and lowered, as well as rotated on each axis. You COULD just put your new Lift Vector right where one of your old ones was. Or you could set it higher or lower, or rotate it a different way, or put it on a different part of the ship altogether, or still leave the old ones on and just find a good space for the new ones elsewhere on the skimmer (and buy a new radiator to account for the increased heat of the additional parts), or maybe move the back vectors closer to the middle and put the new ones where they were, or maybe you should... you get the idea. There is an almost overwhelming degree of customization. You really are free to tinker with your set-up to a very impressive degree. Even without replacing any parts, and just adjusting the placement of your old ones, you can drastically alter the performance and handling of your skimmer. The same part can have very different effects depending upon where it is placed.Just as importantly, every single tweak you make, from replacing a part to simply rotating it a small degree, has very tangible effects on how your ship handles. Mass, weight, and center of gravity all have very real, pronounced effects on your skimmer. Simply moving a part to a different part of your skimmer can completely alter its center of gravity and change the way it handles. Adding a heavier part completely changes its speed, how well the boost works, how easily and how high you can lift, and so forth. Make your skimmer too heavy, and you’re going to slow down and have a hard time making jumps when necessary, and you may be hugging the ground much more than you like. Make it too light with too much lift, and you’ll become too floaty and have a hard time staying close to the ground at all. I once tried a light build with a lot of lift thinking it would make me fast, and basically turned my skimmer into a metallic balloon; when I hit my boost or tried to lift at all, I floated off high into the air, and basically floated around unable to come back down when I wanted. The direction in which your lift vectors are pointed also have huge effects. Pointing them further in or out completely alters the way the handle and steer. You really must account for everything. You actually have to think about your set-up, and experiment. You have an absolutely massive amount of control over your skimmer, and how it performs. Between the varying effects each individual part can have depending on where and how it is placed, the multiple frames you can use, and the variety of parts at your disposal, there is an almost endless amount of customization and possible builds.Of course, none of that would matter if the racing itself wasn't fun. But thankfully, it's a blast. There's something about flying around Mars in a skimmer that you're fully responsible for building yourself, mastering the physics and controls, that is just a joy. When you finally figure out how to take a turn just right, or use the nuanced controls to narrowly avoid an obstacle without losing speed or damaging your skimmer, you feel like the coolest Skimmer pilot in the universe. I've tried playing with both a keyboard and a Steam Controller, and both work well, although i prefer the controller.Awesome game. I'm not even a huge fan of racing games, and this game has still completely sucked me in. Highly recommend checking it out. And if you do, stick with it. It won't take long to get the hang of it, no matter how hard or unwieldy it seems at the beginning. I hope you enjoy it as much as i have thus far.Now if you'll excuse me, i have this idea for a new set-up i need to try out on my skimmer....			",56,29,0,33,27,1,11

								Before I start: I play Vector 36 on the Oculus Rift DK2 and I've played mostly under runtime version 0.8 and only recently started trying the version patched to support 1.3.Furthermore I have spent quite a bit of time playing this game in offline mode. My real playtime at this time should be somewhere around 8 hours.--------------I recommend this game first and foremost, because it is so incredibly unique: The flight model the developer came up with is just that different from everything I've tried before and it really works.It's really hard to put in words how frustrating it is in the beginning ramming yourself into the ground and, even after a relatively short while, how satisfying it is to actually manage to improve your performance in small steps and actually manage to fly really fast.The developer is responsive, and even though some of his forum posts replying to my bug reports or questions were a bit unsatisfying (sometimes sounding like: 'There is not much I can do about it.') he ultimately solved all problems I've had with the game.The visuals don't look that special and the menues are actually pretty ugly. They DO work for getting into races, but IMHO there is still a lot of work to be done ... especially when trying to customize my vehicles while wearing a VR headset. This is definitely still early access.What actually is there however is the incredibly feeling of speed and the phenomenal feeling of control ... and the 'kick' when you try to improve your laptimes a bit, struggling against loosing said control in the process. The flight model is just THAT DAMN GOOD, that I just had to use caps, because, as I've said before: It's hard to put into words how incredibly satisfying this game feels when you are actually racing.If you own a compatible VR headset: Buy this game!(It might or might not be worth a purchase without a VR HMD. I can't tell since the experience is just so amazing with VR, that I couldn't even force myself to try it without. ;) )			",1049,411,37,182,126,12,162

												This game scratches an itch I didn't know I had. It's the epitome of a time sink to perfect your racing technique. It is incredibly unforgiving in the races and tournements so some balancing would be greatly appreciated but I could just 'git gud' and stop losing my cash in crashes. However it outshines the difficulty by being so enjoyable to control so give it a try!			",199,23,19,29,36,3,50

								In actual VR state with tons of crappy minigames and experiences priced like printer ink Vector 36 is one of the very few complete games i find for VR, and bloody hell a really good one!!Long time ago maybe with some performance issues using Vive, probably related to poor performance of steamvr, but in actual status works like a charm.Now i have it running in two rigs,Win 8.1 AMD fx9590 GTX 780ti 32gb ddr3 2400@1866 with Vive and my old potato Win 7 x64 Phenom 1055t@3200 8gb ddr3@1666 GTX660 with Oculus DK2 (so no ASW), running smooth as silk in the potato O_o (yeah, i know i dont believe it first time i tried, but oculus runtimes are far away more polished than steamvr ones).About the game itself, first fligths gonna be hard, is not easy to fly a skimmer in a low density atmosphere and dont be fooled expecting arcade behaviour of the skimmer, is a really hardcore simulator, if you like sims GO BUY IT NOW! plug yout hotas and... May the force be with you little padawan! sure you gonna feel soooo much G force ;).After sometime when you think you master the skills for flying fast as hell you can try to beat Miqueye and Moocow, but the force is strong in them (dark side maybe? who knows :P ).Meanwhile every hour spend in game feels like 10 minutes, every time you pass this curve you feel like you gonna die, every jump people surrounding you thinks you are becoming mad (not my fault, dont yell so loud), every bump you pass too close to the ground you feel like born again... other ones you go too low mate, too low!!! and you feel like a fly in a windshield :DBut not everything related to this game is good... unfortunately few people buy it :(, its sad looking a game like this in vr with poor sales, stop buying crappy 10 minutes demos for low end casuals and buy this game!!! a lot of hours of good game awaits you!!! a good and nice developer deserves your money!!! if he gets enough money maybe he develop another good game!!! or put multiplayer into this one!!! (yeeeah pls pls pls pls) You are a bloody hardcore gamer and you know it, you dont spend a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of bucks in your VR HDM and your monster rig for play cowshit minigames, but you do because you wanna try all you find in VR hoping to find a game who deserves this game. You find it, BUY THIS GAME, BUY IT NOW, BUY OR I HIT YOU WITH A BIG STICK IN THE BLACKHOLE!!! And no, the developer is not my dad, or my girlfriend, or my cousin, i dont know the guy really, but i know his work and he deserves my admiration. And my money! i buyed the game, not free for me!!! and your money too!! PD: No humans or martians are harmed during the make of this comments.			",147,29,28,7,20,2,2

								Vector 36 is something I will be following with high hopes.This isn't an arcade racer, instead following Newtonian principals. It's more like designing and racing your own Formula 1 lunar lander, then always pushing it to fly better than the last race. You're always fine-tuning and balancing your skimmer. Deciding whether you want it to naturally thrust up, down or centre, and placing parts in ways that keep you from listing to the left or right.The racing itself is an intense mixture of speed (in the later leagues) and straining to keep your skimmer under control (from the very start). You start off racing slow but that lets you hone your skill as a pilot. It's like learning to drive a car on ice, then allowing it to fly. Play with a controller for better accuracy but you'll have to switch to keyboard and mouse for menus.This game is very nearly complete and worth every penny.			",21,4,2,12,8,2,0

								One of the best experiences I have had in my Oculus Rift so far.  Great sense of speed (in VR) and fluid controls with HOTAS setup but still works well with XBone controller.  Staying as close to the ground for maximum speed but trying not to hit said ground is a nice gameplay dance that keeps you on your toes.  I feel an in-game tutorial explaining how the different thrusters work and how vector thrust in general works is needed in the future.  Overall a fun title that makes me feel like I am racing at incredible speed over the surface of Mars.  Highly Recommended.			",211,46,4,12,27,3,8

								Heaven help anyone trying to play this with a keyboard or game controller, this is closer to flying a helicopter than driving. Game picked up my X55, keys mapped and was able to unlock the next level without any effort. Gfx are nice on 1080 without SS, entry level ship is a little slow and sluggish - that's the point of the game i guess - you race and upgrade.   Some reviewers have cited VR nausea, i experienced none even when bouncing off canyon walls. I can't say the same for games like Project Cars which makes me ill when i race through hills or stack a car.  Kudos to the devs for making something that isn't about go fast, colorful novelty - this takes skill and even in the limited time i've had to play this i can understand why so many people love it.   Recommended if you like sims and use a joystick.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is my favorite seated VR game right now.So you race in a 'Skimmer' that at first reminded me of SW pod-racing (loved that game), until I actually tried to pilot one. This game is more on the simulation side than the arcade side of the spectrum, but don't think Flight Simulator, think Gran Turismo. This supported my very context-appropriate Logitech joystick and so I fumbled through the controls, went through the tutorials twice then proceeded to lose races, start engine fires and crash my skimmer into cliffsides. The learning curve felt steep in the beginning but flying the skimmer around Mars, learning to handle the heap of bolts, even while losing was a lot of fun.One thing I really love is that some game modes don't punish you for losing or crashing your skimmer, some even allow unlimited restarts, but others make you pay for damages to your skimmer incurred during the race and if your ship breaks down during a tournament race, you get 0 points for that race. This really makes you really afraid to bump into anything, including the ground. If you barrel off a ledge at high speed and forget to apply the vertical thrusters at the right time, you could die. Too much vertical thrust and you lose momentum frighteningly fast.Eventually you learn how to pilot pretty okay, then you start upgrading and customizing and you start to realize that with every modification you have to re-learn how to control your skimmer. This eventually becomes pretty rewarding, though I still feel like a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ skimmer engineer. This is my 2nd skimmer, she is a little harder to handle than my last one, but way faster:


She isn't the easiest ship to pilot but she is mine, and she is FAST.

You are given a lot of freedom to build/customize your skimmer, probably too much freedom for most, but that is one of the aspects that really sets this apart from other racers. You are given a way to easily modify, test, modify, test, over and over until you get your skimmer handling how you want. This process can be unforgiving at times. You might rotate a thruster 20 degrees and suddenly your ship faceplants tragically onto the test platform and catches fire. Luckily you can save and go back to earlier versions of your skimmer quite easily. Tweak, test, tweak!This isn't just a tech demo. There are quick races, practice races, tutorials, tournaments, shareable ghost replays, and a deep customization system. Even in EA, this is a game I could see myself putting 50+ hours into, a steal at the current $15 asking price. Give it a try, you can always return it if it doesn't pull you in.UPDATE - Gameplay Footage:

												This game is absolutely fantastic and offers an extremely unique racing experience, but be warned: The learning curve is incredibly steep and the game is absolutely merciless.Patient players who take the time to master the controls and the way skimmers handle will be rewarded with some of the most intense racing I've witnessed so far. Playing in VR feels incredibly good and well optimised skimmers can move very quickly, there's a real sensation of speed and drifting around a corner at 600kph is a harrowing sensation.Getting to the point where you can reliably drive your skimmer will take a while, though, as there's a lot to keep track of. Elevation, heat levels, boost, fuel bias and more all have a very real effect on your craft, and learning how to manage these systems in the middle of a race is key to your victory.You get to design your own skimmer from a decent selection of parts, and the way you put your craft together makes a gigantic difference to the way it controls. Pitching your thrusters the wrong way will gut your speed and handling, distributing the weight unevenly on your craft will cause severe problems at high speeds, and you can even get your hands dirty by individually tweaking the handling and limits of most parts.Chances are you'll spend a good few hours of gameplay making small but significant edits to your craft, then racing, failing, and going back to adjust your craft. For some people, this will be dealbreaker. For me, it's incredibly rewarding and when you finally land on a winning design that suits your playstyle, the feeling is unbeatable.This game isn't easy in any sense of the word, but if you want a challenge that's a refreshing break from the usual car sims, this is definitely worth your time.

								Vector 36 is a physics based racer that takes place on Mars.  It is pretty unique as far as racing games go, as it has both believable physics and hovercraft, which are not normally found together.In Vector 36 you can construct your own Skimmers, which are what the craft are called.  Construction requires you to consider balance between power and stability, as well as actual balance, as center of gravity and thrust will affect the performance of the craft.  I have found few games go to this level of physics as far as customization, it's not just how big of an engine you can stick on the ship, but where it is put and how it is angled.I have only recently tried the VR aspect myself, as I only just now recieved a VR headset.  I have played on a monitor until now and I must say that it is a completely different experience in VR, and I personally loved flying around in the cockpit in 3D, it felt much more immersive being able to actually appreciate the inside of my skimmer for the first time.I don't do number scores for games as I really never know exactly how to quantify it, but I personally recommend this game to any fans of sci-fi and racing simulators.

								Excellent game in VR, the feeling of racing and being there is awesome!The physics based simulation means this is no easy game, no arcade. You will crash, you will burn; but when you control your skimmer and get 110% performance out of it, its clearly a great feeling.The tracks are varied with lots of ground types: water, rocks, chasms, wavy surfaces...all these affect how you pilot, as your ship *needs* the ground, its no flyer, just a skimmer.I play with a Vive, a Thrustmaster T.flight HOTAS X and a GTX 770 (Yes, a 770 NOT a 970....Amazing! I play on High quality and I miss NO FRAMES!)Some things could be improved, like the UI in the garage and some of the pop ups that come too close to your face; but the studio though a single person is dedicated to the game, communicates with the players and keeps improving things.

This game is in an early access state so I will judge accordinglyTL;DR Great concept with great game play for such an early stage but it needs more time to fulfill its potentialThe GoodVector 36 is a great idea that has so far been well executed, the immersion from using the cockpit on a VR system is great and fits the theme perfectly. The builder system is a nice concept where you can mix and match a small range of parts to create a racer to compete in higher leagues, not quite an armored core range of parts but this is an early stage. Racing rewards risk taking, such as adjusting the 'bias' which basically means you will go faster but at the cost of maneuvering and altitude. I love the concept of this game and even at this early stage it is my go-to VR experience. I was surprised at how easy it was to plug in my X55 and Vive an start playing within minutes, a luxury that even large games struggle with. The soundtrack fits really well with the game play giving a nice escape from the sounds of thrusters.The BadWhilst the ability to customize your skimmer down to the balance of the thrusters is great the garage needs to be improved before I and others can use it properly, trying to alter the power distribution sliders in VR is horrible, I want 80% power not 78% or 82%. There is no formal guide as to recommended tactics when making your skimmer although the dev does have some (older) videos on YouTube and there is a discussion section on the community hub, I personally found that 10 hours into the game it all starts to make sense, but some people don't have 10 hours to sink into a game (although if you bought a HMD I suspect you do). Final point - this is an early access game with DLC, the dev has argued that he sees the DLC as a luxury that not all users will need which I can mostly understand, but I sincerely hope that we don't see any Payday 2, Call of duty or other cash grabbing DLC installments in the future.This is shaping up to be a really fun game and if the VR garage problems along with the complexity factors can be worked on I see this being an even better game.Edit 1: Other points after further time with game + Spellcheck ",297,35,17,25,50,0,45

								Playing this game on an HTC Vive with an X55 HOTAS. All the axis' and buttons for the controllers were mapped well by defalt, so I only had to do minimal adjustments to the controller setup to get it to my liking. It took me a little while to understand the basics of how to control the skimmer, but once I got the hang of it - oh boy - this game is an absolute blast! It manages to capture the spirit of traditional (car) racing games, in that you want to return to a track again and again to learn the layout and improve your lap times. At the same time - it doesn't really require lightning reflexes like many other games do - since a lot of inertia is involved in steering the skimmer. You have to plan your moves ahead, especially at higher speeds. I feel it's more about constant risk management. It feels sooo rewarding when you get a perfect drift at high speed though a tight corner. But don't think you've mastered it yet, or else you'll smack in the cliffs at the next turn.The feeling of presence is great. I am in the cockpit, all the instruments are perfectly readable. The engine sounds are intense. The controls feel just about right. Sure, there are a few bugs and things that can (and most likely will) be improved. Occasionally the mouse cursor hangs in the meny, and I have to reboot the whole game. There are sometimes a few missed frames while racing (GTX 980), but for the most part the game runs fluid. Modding the skimme is difficult, as it is not obvious how replacing a part or tweaking the placement / angle of said part will influence the skimmers behaviour. So - until further - I just use the stock skimmers, but there's plenty of fun to be had in those. I very much recommend this game. It has a very interesting gameplay, it has depht, replayability and is just fantastic in VR. Even though it's early access, it feels like a lot more complete game than most other available Vive / VR games on Steam. And when you buy it - don't rage quit after 15 minutes just because you don't understand the controls. It takes a bit of effort to learn the core basics (about an hour in my case), but it's well worth the effort. ",41,7,4,2,9,0,0

								TL;DR; Give podracing mostly realistic physics and customization elements and you have this game. Really fun in VR.Pros:The racing is really fun and can be tense as hell once you buy a faster skimmer! You need to intelligently manage the power going to your thrusters and to the engines keeping you aloft, or you'll clip the ground and lose a ton of speed. The whole thing feels really intelligent and careful even when you're screaming over a jump trying to overtake someone.It uses mostly realistic physics, but it isn't overwhelmingly complex. You need to keep thrust-to-weight ratios in mind and angle your parts correctly when you stick them to the chassis. If carefully picking and tweaking your setup doesn't sound fun, you can buy prebuilt skimmers for ingame money that work great. It feels a lot like podracing, except harder sci-fi.Cool looking cockpit and parts, which adds a lot when you're in VR. Impact alarms will go off if you crash or damage something, part failure will be displayed on in-cockpit screens, and information about the race is visible.This game is being actively developed! Early Access development hell? ♥♥♥♥ no! This is a game you can expect to be finished and released.Cons:The game isn't fully released yet, so not all the content is added and polished. It isn't a serious problem and the game is still worth purchasing.			",271,70,7,34,36,5,27

								An excellent racer/tuner game. Incredible work by a one-man dev team, if I understand correctly.This guy not only made a game with physics-based flight and custom ships, he made every bit of tuning you do actually relevant! Not for a casual player, though. You can and will massively unbalance your skimmer if you don't pay attention to your thrust's power-balance and center of gravity.Add to that, this guy's supporting his first project -very- well. It's anecdotal, but I asked in the forum about supporting multiple USB inputs for HOTAS set-ups. The dev responded personally, and it was added in the very next patch a day later.Super good game if you're into flight, racing, and tinkering/tuning. HIGHLY recommended.			",334,20,0,36,19,1,23

The ship building and customizing is pretty hard to comprehend, but this thing is still in early access. I'm looking forward to spending massive amounts of time in this one.

								VR Review - on Oculus DK2 - nVidia 780TiOn high graphics settings it looks good but has a bit of judder - maintains a 75+ framerate pretty well at low detail.  The smooth nature of the flight motions and the fact you're in a cockpit make this a comfortable VR experience.  While there's room for plenty of polish this is already a fun pod racer style game.  Hopefully there's enough early interest to ensure the indie developer can keep this going and flesh it out fully.As for right now, if you're looking to flirt with a physics based racer on your DK2 for a bit, this is complete enough and comfortable enough to be worth some of your time now.

								A masterful physics based racing experience unlike any other.Some spoilers, but only if you're a weirdo who likes to discover physics engine principles through testing.If you are a fan of racing games and vehicle simulators in general, then you owe it to yourself to try Vector 36. If you own an HMD as well, you have zero reasons to miss this one, the VR implementation is spot on. This is precisely the experience I was looking for when I bought my DK2 and a Vive. There have been many attempts in gaming and simulator history to invent a new style of imaginative vehicle. Very rarely is a developer able to forge something that's unique, intuitive, challenging, and fun. Red River has done it; everything else will be gravy.Even for experienced simulator pilots though, this game requires some mental effort from you. If you think you're going to get into the seat of a skimmer and win in your first three attempts like 50cc class Mario kart race, temper those expectations. Think of the experience like how Neil Armstrong must have felt the first time he sat in the LLRV. It's not a plane, it's not a helicopter, it's something different. Even though he was one of the most experienced pilots on the planet at the time, there was a new puzzle for him to learn and master and success was hugely dependant on his careful inputs.If I had to compare piloting the skimmer to a real world analogue it would be my guess that it reacts something like a wing in ground-effect vehicle (WIG.) Although, at a lower gravity with the ground effect pressure being multiplied by downward thruster pressure instead of large wing surfaces. That is, it's feels very much like what is visually happening. You can really start to feel and anticipate the ground effect cushion once you get the hang of it and it becomes a wonderful factor that needs careful management to navigate the purposefully crafted 3D course surfaces successfully. the thruster balance setting (% of power to lift thrusters from total power output) that can be changed on the fly is a critical control to utilize when adjusting your skimmer. Something that would normally be a dynamic setting in the backend of the vehicle physics is open for pilots to experiment with and leverage. Similar to F1's DRS system, it's a physical control that can be played strategically for an advantage on straightaways. My favorite aspect of the physics involved has got to be the dramatic drifts around sharp corners. Similar to turning a hovercraft, things are not based on grip coefficients, but rear thrust vector.  You can set up the ship to have a river tube feel, where only the reward thrust aimed in the correct direction will adjust your major trajectory, or you can add and position lift thrusters that have small wing like components that will act like elevons to cut your trajectory through the atmosphere for more violent turns, pilot blackout effects included :D. I tend to prefer the flat yawing river tube feel. needing precise timing to initiate a flat spin over 100 degrees to change directions quickly, and then float rearward for a period of time before the thrusters set you on your new path. Fantastic stuff. use that ""jump"" button or perish.The major striking aspect of the gameplay here is the Kerbal style vehicle building and physical consequences that result. It was totally staggering the first time I made a modification to a ship I had become accustomed to and discovered the affect it had on the flight characteristics.  I had replaced the stock radiator of the Firewave ship with a part that had far better cooling and was shaped more like a long vertical turbine blade. Setting the part on the ship was very simple and intuitive. Precise adjustment of it's position was made even easier with minute control of the three rotational axis that the part can sit at. I decided to roll the radiators over the top of the fuselage to act as a sort of spoiler, pushing the ship down with aerodynamics at speed. I thought it might be cool if I could feel some effect, but mostly was positioning it for aesthetics. Well, in the next race I set off as normal down a fairly typical hole-shot straightaway, noticing a slight difference in the float feel of the ship, but wasn't sure if it was psychosomatic or real.  When I got to the first corner I did as I always do ""late-brake"" by yawing the full rotation of the turn, hitting the booster, and drifting around the wall.  To my wonderment, I started rising into the air, very quickly, what felt like hundreds of feet in a short time. This was definitely different, definitely something had changed.  It took a few laps to really get the feel for the new ship, but what was obvious was that while my radiator positioning was working as I had intended in a straight line, when my ship rotated to drift perpendicular to my direction of travel, the radiators were positioned to act like elevators in a pitch-up condition!!! lifting me up several stories despite the lift thrusters being in a lower, normal state.That was it for me. That was the point that I knew I was experiencing something special. This game was not going to hold my hand and spoon feed me the experience it thought I wanted. This is sandbox engineering done very, very right. Combined with the ""gyro"" part, presumably acting like a flight controller in a multirotor drone by diverting thrust power to maintain level condition, the 12-course meal of vehicle physics in this game are both extremely deep, but very approachable for those of us who can remember the Jane's combat days. It's not Mario-Kart. It's way way way better.Understandably though, it's not for everyone. There are a lot of people out there who fancy themselves badass virtual pilots when someone else has adjusted all the expos and aero for them. This game requires more thinking than that, and as a result can be immensely rewarding when you discover a formula that rips! But it can also prove frustrating when the results don't match your ideas and there's no virtual mechanic to help walk you through design elements. However, things are happening for a reason, and in a very alpha Minecraft way, it's up you to discover what those patterns of creation are.If your first reaction to the game is ""these ships are slow and clunky"" I promise you, you are only two race wins away (not remotely hard once you get the feel) from enough cash to purchase a machine that can seriously get your heart going. Spoiler: I recommend not doing any upgrades to the stock ship. Win two races, trade up to the Firewave, buy the radiator with the tier-one cooling power and you have a machine that can endlessly turbo without worrying about heat management. This will give you a seriously fast ship that's still forgiving to control in turns. You can win quite handily with this set up and the speed and stakes get nice and high. Another pro-tip: the jump button is also affected by the turbo button. Used together, you get turbo lift, which can save your♥♥♥♥♥when you mess up your float.Even if Vector 36 fizzles from a lack of player interest (which would be a real tragedy,) I am certain we'll see more from Red River in the future if they keep applying whatever method they have been to create this gem of a cockpit experience. I know enough about vehicle physics and programing to see that this is a true labour of love. That the feeling you get from piloting the skimmers is an obsessively crafted experience, deeply worthy of your time.Top-shelf, Ryan!All my play time has been:-in the Vive-Xbone controller (flawless for testing)-GTX 980 on a 4790K with 16GB DDR3 1866 RAM.

It's really nice to finally master the controls and begin zipping across the landscape at 600+ then riding the inside of a canyon wall as you drift perfectly 10 feet above the jagged rocks and accelerate out at blinding speed. Using the Steam controller from the get go I loaded a template of someone else who'd had a good few hours getting a feel for it and was able to jump right in and enjoy it within minutes, I didn't try Mouse/Keyboard, it's hard to see where the keys are when using a HMD. This is one of the VR games that will keep me coming back, as said, really enjoying this one. Go for it, it's priced just right for what you get. +Great Physics+Sense of speed+Satisfying scenery+Nicely crafted courses+Build your own Skimmer+Graphics were reasonable and immersion was achieved+Great performance on High settings (970 GTX - i7 3770 - 16gig RAM)+Price is fair+Works great with Steam Controller-Steep learning curve-No character customization?

								ok so have played this in both htv vr and normal both with xbox 360 controler and a mad catz joystick and it is sooo ♥♥♥♥ing fun :-) its is not done yet however it is in a state where its is fun and can be played over and over :-) and the budilng of ship/skimmer is goodover all i like this game a lot :-) at this time i have played 2,8 houres...fyi this game is not only for htv vive or rift but for everone that likes to go fast and have 100% control over ones skimmer :-) buy it and play it and love it :-)edit : bias control is the best :-) but not the same as thrust control (bias higher % gives more power to forward whiler low gives more to the hovring at the cost of the forward thurst :-) have seen a few ppl having problem with this..)

								It gives me an adrenaline rush playing this game. In VR, you feel the speed and it's awesome. Cockpit games as far as I'm concerned are PERFECT for VR. I tried this a while ago with the Oculus DK2 and there was some judder, but with the Vive, and the game updates, it's looking pretty smooth now. I love games that incorporate physics and this one does a good job of it.. you can 'feel' the mass of your vehicle... as in you can sense the inertia and the thrust mechanics... it is a blast just flying around. Once you get the hang of it, you'll be able to haul♥♥♥♥♥and get in the zone.. when that happens, it's very cool.			",182,44,4,26,48,1,28

								Played on VR with xbox one controller.The nicest games are the ""instant"" ones because it seems all vehicles are equal there.It would be fine if you can just choose speed classes. And allow some balancing between gyro/thrust etc manually. with easy sliders.Currently if you buy parts, and for example you have two engines in your items, you cannot see clearly which one is active and nothing changes if you select either, so you never know which one stays active or becomes active.The shop and buying skims and parts is too complex, you cannot use the arrow buttons and you have to scroll through each parts category the whole time to decide which part is best which is boring, you just want to race.The screen is resetting to the direction where you are watching at unexpected moments, it should be a pre-choosen key manually only.All menu's force you to go with the mouse pointer to select a button and hit A to click. Would be much easier if left-right-up-down would jump between the active button to select it that way. Instead of joystick as mouse.The game crashed once and created a crash dump.GTX 1080 goes to 100% on the GPU most of the time during the game. I have ran much more heavy games which never used 100% so some rendering efficiency needs to be looked into as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastic racing game and flight sim.  Definitely will appeal to anyone that likes and understands helicopter flight.  The light simulation elements are deep enough to make a very engaging experience.  Love playing with HOTAS and TrackIR.  The UI was hard to work with on release, but has improved a lot and the dev has added to the game a lot more than anticipated after release. Standout feature for me is that ability to pretty much design the modular skimmers from scratch, cooling, wieght and balance, direction of lift and thrust and, this is the amazing one, build the fly-by-wire system - literally what movement controls what.  It's so creative and addictive trying to get a little more speed out of your skimmer.  Will you try to get better control with thrusters on long stilts  -  or build it to take knocks with chunky close in engines.Unique, special and suprisingly deep and immersive experience - I really love this game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Vector 36 although early access provides a unique high speed thrill over an alien landscape.I must say that when I first tried this game a year ago I found it difficult to understand the flight mechanics.  Now it's quick and easy to setup with my HOTAS system.There's a great sense of being in the cockpit of a fast skimmer.  I use a vibration feedback system so I feel the rumble of the engines.I really must try this in multiplayer with friends.I believe the dev is soon to release a big update.  For the future it would be nice to see an expansion (paid in order to support development) with another world to race over.For anyone who wants a more serious/hardcore racing experience (albeit fictional) then I recommend Vector 36...

								This game is pretty sweet. I would describe it as if Elite Dangerous and Episode 1 Racer had a baby. The speeds of the racers feel a bit slower than Episode 1 Racer, but driving the pod has a feeling much like Elite Dangerous. I played on HTC Vive with Warthog HOTAS which it supported both natively! I didn't run into any framerate issues as I have seen other people in discussion mention. I'm playing it with 980Ti, 4690k, 32GB for reference. I didn't get dizzy at all. The starter pod kinda sucks the one in the tutorials handles much better. I'll update this as I spend more time in the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome game! I highly recommend using this in VR, as it very convincingly replicates what it must be like to engage in an extremely expensive and fatal sport. This is frustratingly challenging to master, but the physics seem real enough - piloting these machines at high speed takes your full focus and concentration to avoid disaster, juggling throttle, bias, boost, pitch, roll and yaw - but what a blast it is!

								Easily one of the best VR experiences available right now.  This is a game that requires a bit of time to really understand controls.  If you can stick with it through the tutorials and the first ship upgrade you are in for one hell of a ride. Screaming down a canyon at 900 mph and peeking out your side window at another racer before pulling ahead is a dream come true.  I'm reminded of games like F Zero and Wipeout and actually being in the cockpit is something special. I personally like that this is not a racer you can just pick up and expect to be a pro at.  It's got a great amount of depth and nuance which you can really sink time into and improve at.  There's a ton of extra fine tuning for enthusiasts for upgrading the skimmer.   This also has a steep learning curve as its all physics based and the position and power of your components will dramatically change how the skimmer handles.   I'm pretty hooked on this one.  In a marketplace where most VR experiences are so short and superficial it is refreshing to find this gem with the depth and mechanics to keep me coming back to.  I can't wait for online multiplayer.  For those with complaints of motion sickness I have to say I don't get it one bit.  I personally think the whole ""vr legs"" thing is a very true phenomenon.  When I first got the vive a number of games had me nauseous but after several weeks of just powering through that nothing really gets to me anymore.  This one I'd say is pretty tame compared to others.  Highly recommended.			",11,13,1,1,5,1,1

								This is one of the most enjoyable games I have found to play regularly in my rift and I am not saying I have had a problem with enjoying vr. This game has achieved hooking me in to tweak and retweak mindset to improve times. Brutal at first and learning the garage function took some patience. Game is gorgeous and runs well on my 3570k/980ti with some minor slow down here and there. Don't go head first into this if you are new to vr. Ease in and you will be fine. Starter ship is nice and slow but I still wince when I bottom out my ship even after 8 hours in.  Cheap and it scratches the same itch that Dirt Rally does for me. Give it a try.

												This game might not be for you, this is for people who play driving sims and flight sims in VR without feeling sick. This is for people who have a HOTAS setup with VR. This game is not a casual racing game....expect to spend hours and hundreds of mk versions of your ship before it runs good and expect to restart the game more than once. It's not easy but its rewarding because at this moment its very easy to be the number one in this game and very cool to see your name at the fastest speed. This game is a huge recommendation from me if you are someone that has vr stilts not just legs and for someone who likes to compete against themself.			",383,38,28,41,26,6,36

								This is the kind of VR Racing game i was looking for. When you survive the first hour of controller struggles (I'm using a Hotas X - but it works also with Keyboard, Mouse & Controller), you start to think you can actually archive something, then the game really opens up. The tutorial doesn't make it easy at first - but with a little patience it gets better. You can customize your vehicles - and i'm not talking about a ""Red Sticker"" to your wings, no - you can put a lot of stuff where you want  (engines, thruster, fuel, etc) - but don't hope that you first selfmodifed vehicle will survive (Physics FTW!). Its tricky and you have to learn it - but it's fun and -again- with patience you will (maybe) succeed. ;)GFX & SFX are very nice, theres a bunch of tracks and game modes where you can earn in-game money to buy new stuff for your vehicle - or buy a complete new one.It's an early access title so get used to some bumps here and there, but nothing major - i've seen a lot of AAA-Titles that where not polish like this one.All in all, i'm very satisfied.I've played it with the Rift and the Vive - both are working as they should, but because this is a seated experience, you should go with the Rift, if you own both.Got it on a Sale, but would not mind to buy full price.

								This game is awsome! A unique experience on the Vive. I can't belive its made by just one person. I actually like this racing experience better than Project Cars in VR, although they are quite different and the comparison isn't really fear. Anyway, buy this game if you have a VR headset, play the tutorials (hidden in the race menu) and have a blast! I still have some stuttering, but the developer is working hard on it and has made it a lot better, so I think he will make it perfect in the end. Seems it's good for most people with worse specs than mine (gtx 980ti). And even as it is I'll recommend it wholeheartly.			",260,94,11,5,33,2,13

												Great game!  I bought it last summer and didn't spend a lot of time with it because I couldn't figure out how to control it at the time.  There have been a lot of updates since I last tried it and so I just gave it another go over the past few days. Wow!  The control is much better now which allowed me to play the game long enough to start getting the hang of it.  It really is an exhilirating game in VR.  Skimming over the surface at high speeds while trying to avoid obstacles is really great fun.  It really feels like I'm playing the Pod Racing scene from Star Wars.  Highly recommended!

								-Only VR game I've played that made me sick at 90fps.-Ship customization options are nice, they dont seem to do anything.-Ship flying speed indicates 180 something per something. Actual speed feels like 45mph at best, I spent most of my time around 10mph.-Constantly crashing in to the ground, I find the hovering is based on what terrain is below, as in, if there's a hole in the terrain you will drop a bit. This is nice but if you hit boost to keep you up out of said hole you come to a dead stop and it takes me a good 30 seconds to get back up to speed. -Hard to go physically forward, went over the controls, adjusted trim feathered the boost, rebuilt/balanced my starter craft, bought new parts that were ""better""; but, I was never able to even see the other racers most of the time when I raced, never mind take anything other than last place.-Graphics/models of the ships is quite good and I enjoyed all the modeling. It's very promising there.-Terrain textures and models looks like that off a cellphone game on low resolution.			",82,51,2,8,19,0,9

								when you do your first rounds in this game, you will become convinced that the controls are broken, that the ships - or skimmers as they are called here - don't respond to inputs correctly.but don't despair and keep trying. the controls are working exactly as intended.once you understand that your skimmer has forward thrust and upward thrust, and that you use BIAS to split your thrust between the two, AND you learn to use bias properly, then you will have a lot of fun. (input device totaling at least 4 axis recommended)Pro:+unique concept+detailed physics model+the controls setup is splendid+controls are very responsive and adaptive+you can tweak the thrust vectoring to your personal style+YOU DON'T NEED A VR GOGGLE TO PLAYCons:- a bit of a learning curve, but that's okay for an entirely new style of racing game- camera. without VR, you either can't see very well where your skimmer is going- feeling of speed. compared to how fast i'm moving, i sometimes feel the indicated speed is missing a decimal point. but  you get used to it and the effect is less apparent once you upgrade your skimmer to go faster than 500 regularly.

								Vector 36 is a great game. It's also the closest you'll get to Star Wars Podracing in VR.First time I played this, I took it off and realized 2 hours had passed. I introduced it to my friend and he played for almost 5 hours straight! He was doing full tournaments trying to unlock this vehicle and learning the subtleties of the games flying system.What's interesting is it actually feels like a real game..probably the first VR game to give me that feeling of a campaign mode where you go through different races and tournaments and earn money to buy new vehicles and upgrades.It's also seems to have a bit of inspiration from games like Kerbal Space program where you can attach the parts in different areas and experiment. Flying the vehicles has a bit of a learning curve but it's so satisfying when you finally get good at it ! Apparently it's made by someone who worked at NASA or something so the physics are realistic. I also found the 3 vehicles I drove feel very different. Even the inner cockpits are designed differently. ",265,62,7,43,23,4,28

								Don't take this review to heart, I only played for about 15 minites then let my friends try it.All played on the HTC Vive.These are just my thoughts on it.-Game did not seem very optimized. Kept losing frames, I run a gtx980 right now and the rest of my build it BUILT for VR, on top of that it just wasn't a very pretty game to look at. It wasn't bad but it really wasn't anyhting special-Load times are long and crashed a couple times on us within an hour.-Motion sickness was moderate, I got sick quickly but it didn't get any worse from when it started but definetely felt it in my stomach after I took my headset off, and that was only playing for about 15 minutes. (That wasn't the reason i stopped though)-Controls/flight mechanics are a bit odd from what I played. You can adjust the vehicles hover height from the ground, but the higher you get the slower you go. I just felt like I had very little control, at least with the starting vehicle.-I got up to about ~200 mph(?) and still felt like i was going pretty slow. the video made it seem like I would be going much faster. But again it could have just been my starting vehicle, but I can't image how sick I would have gotten going super fast.-Physics just felt a little too akward, not enough control for the player. Too much sliding and bouncing aroundGraphics 6/10 (based off other VR games I've seen)Gameplay 4.5/10     Bland, covered up but cool techno music XDConcept 9/10    Would be amazing if it had like power ups or weapons, mario kart style ;) The racing alone wasn't enoughOverall 4/10I asked for a refund.Not a horrible game, but i was dissapointed. I think I was hoping for something more like Pod  Racers from StarWars.I hope your experience is better :)			",81,17,1,1,13,1,13

								Promising..Very dificult to control with x-box controller.. Without a tutorail it's also hard to get a hang of the thrust conrtols..I'm just not requesting a refund because I believe it will be better whence it's released.. Polished for better controls and such.It's just that, the Bias control, when trying to keep afloat you can not move forward fast enough..If you move forward, you cannot keep afloat.. Reflex tells me to pull up to get higher with %90 forward thrust bias.. but I just crash down.. Guess cuz of no wings ? :D[EDIT]I just came here to edit my post after longer playing time.. When you get a hang of things, It really starts to shine..Now how can I change my thumbs down to a thumbs up...I mean.. sorry for the hasty review but.. it's quite the thing to get used to it..

												This game is awesome!  The learning curve is a little bit steep but the payoff is enormously satisfying.  Once you get the hang of it, piloting the skimmers around the track is thrilling!  Building custom skimmers is richly rewarding.  It's customizable and every design will behave differently.  Race against other players' ghost replays and see if you can beat them with a fresh new design! For VR users; I've got pretty good VR legs, but occasionally I do get a little blech.  The very first time I played this, it got to me.  The 2nd play session felt better, and after that I've had NO issue whatsoever with nausea.  I don't know why I got used to it, but I did.  The only time guests complain about motion sickness is in the blue grid testing area, but you can avoid that area while in VR.Head on over to the steam community's discussion pages and learn the basics of skimmer engineering!  Hope to see you all on the leaderboards!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Control is really hard - yeah I can get around a course but AI is zooming by me like Im standing still. Upgraded my thrust (little better) but still hard.  Shows great promise... but having a hard time connecting with it.  Love the cockpit and VR feel.  (some complain of buying a 4 save slots option? of course that would be ridiculous after paying for a game but only 2 complaints about that - so maybe they're mistaken).   I think it will come in time.  A review says tutorials helped him fly (I don't see any tutorials). I'll have to give it another look.  Only played about a hour so far.VIVE support sold me.  Nice to have early access - Will keep hoping for improvements.			",197,38,12,5,37,3,2

												Absolutely mind-blowing in VR (use Always On re-projection for smooth 90fps)Nothing else out there comes anywhere close to this, it's a gift from the VR Gods.			",102,23,12,2,20,2,1

								Vector 36 is a fun, well-optimised game about racing hovercars, or 'skimmers' as they're called in-game, over the surface of Mars. With a joystick for controls the skimmer is very intuitive and responsive. The gameplay is fun, races take time to master and the process of modifying and upgrading your skimmer to create a successful machine is pretty rewarding. 8/10			",50,6,1,6,6,0,6

								TL;DR: Have some money to burn? Don't have a lighter handy? Have some harddrive space handy instead? Here's your solution. Eh, if you want a tweaker racing game you're better off playing Nascar. While this is certainly very interesting, there's very little to add to the value of the game right now. The Dev has also decided to shill out some nonsense for some human dollars in pre-alpha DLC, so take that for what you will. But what is Vector 36? Its fantastic, when it wants to be. The racing feels like you're podracing without midichlorians and whiney child-actors. A single wrong move will splatter your dumb carcass over the nearest rock and the race will end for you in the sense there's no way you'd be able to catch up. You get repaired by a little drone-thing mid-race if you do lose some parts, which is nice, but you have to wait for it to start paying attention, then find your broken parts strewn across the landscape, then weld it back roughly where it went before.Wether or not it works after you're 'repaired' is entirely up to how many radiators you strapped on to begin with, and how many work after crashing. PROS: > Its fun to go 700+ mph> Its fun to mess with the AI racers, even if they tend to follow exactly the same line of movement. I like slamming into their radiors and watching them slowly burn up when they break off. > Its fun to watch the AI crash and burn around a simple corner> Its fun to build your skimmerCONS:> Its not fun slamming into a wall at 700+ mph because you don't have a perfectly tuned skimmer and it turns out you lose all steering above or below a certain speed and 'bias', which is the ratio between the lift thrusters and the forward thrusters. > Its not fun to grind through the same race over and over again to get the next part or chassis, especially considering the AI have better parts and go faster by default because of this, nevermind their near perfect piloting against your unexperianced hands> Its not fun to pay $4.50 of your human dollars for a few garage slots in an alpha game that already asks for a lump sum of $17.00. I'll recommend it, but only for the promise of future development and my lust for a true death-race style game that has good tweaking. Not if you want a finished product, for obvious reasons.
