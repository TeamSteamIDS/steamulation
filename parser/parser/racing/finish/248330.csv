												I started playing this game from a young age I can't even remember and I have always gone back to it, over the years I have seen it improve massively and I'm proud to say that I love this game, it's extremely joyful and entertaining for me and for many others. There are many things I love about this game, but something that is worth a mention is the hugely addictive multiplayer. I have always found the community, even it's changed as I have played, a delight to talk to and play with. I massively recommend this game to honestly anyone. Please pick it up. I beg you!

												iirc this is the game that replaces ""f*** you"" in chat with ""Lets Cuddle""Its pretty simple, but very well made.  You do everything dinosaurs do, including: running, eating and becoming extinct. Its great.Devs sent keys to everyone who bought the game. I think I actually got it on a free day many many years ago and they sent me a key anyway. They are the real heros.Also devs if you're listening, hit us up with some splitscreen and controller support.  That would be great.			",271,37,5,11,13,5,15

												An instant classic, Dino Run is one of my favorite little games. A long time player and it rarely gets old. Has enough modes and difficulty levels to give you a good thrashing when you're running from your demise. Achievements, trophies, and the like are also a great feature, they can be very hard but rewarding in the end. Speed runs are a good way to occupy yourself when you've completed campaign, and do get challenging! Unlike other games, the top level achievemments and hardest difficulty 'insane' are truly difficult. The controls are very simplistic but there's a learning curve to jumping about to keep your speed up. Customization with hats and colours help you trick out your dino. Be a spacedino! A fancy top-hatted one! Up to you! The only issue one may find is multiplayer, while great in its implementation you'll find it a bit deserted. The single player alone should more than enough justify buying this game though! Overall, a fantastic game and I highly recommend this to everyone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												6.4/10 - An Original Runner Still Evading Extinction!There is lots of good stuff happening with this game. It’s a lot more fun than I remember and now there are different modes, customization and more! Multiplayer was added, but I've yet to get anyone to engage in a race due to the lack of player base. It's important to note that this game isn't worth $6; it's nice but doesn't have the juice to keep you hooked. You play as a dinosaur who must escape the apocalypse heading in your direction! Run, Jump, Fly and ride boulders to safety. I completed all the sections on Easy in about 40 minutes, but since the levels are constantly changing you can keep adding difficulty for a newish experience each run. Overall, I'd pay $1-3 based on nostalgia and interest levels. Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more. Free Keys and Reviews weekly!

												One of those kind of games that are simple and easy to pick up for a few minutes of play in between being busy! You pretty much just run from one side of the map to the other, all the while avoiding the impending meteor apocalypse. There are different games modes also that change this, one included that lets you go about casually without needing to worry about death, handy for multiplayer chatting.I played the original often on browser, but I really love the new stuff included in this and the achievements are fun too. You can also customize your dino, and I'm a sucker for customization so +10 points for that in itself.			",198,20,7,14,9,1,1

												Dino run DX is a game where you play as a little dinosaur during the apocalypse running from a giant wall of doom. You eat many things along the way such as, eggs, other little dinos and birds. You catch a ride with pterodactyls or ride giant objects or animals, and get powerups that give you a little boost. If you get destroyed from the wall of doom you lose a life sending you back to the beginning of the level, you have 3 in total. When you lose them all, you become extinct forcing you to restart from the start. There are different levels of dificulty to chose from and the game lets you customise your little dino with different hats and choices of skin colour. You can upgrade your dino after every level to increase his speed, acceleration, strength etc... Its a fun, short game and is fun for mostly younger ages, so i recomend you get a young sibling or cousing to play this as they might enjoy this a lot. I know, i only have 44 mins on this game... on steam.If i am correct, this is the first video game i have ever played. As a kid, i was bored while my parents we're working, so when my dad showed me a website called miniclip with all these cool ""Video games"" i freaked out, hell, i was scared at the idea of a video game. So i went onto the website for the first time, and like every 5 (6? can't remember that well) year old boy, I LOVED THE DINOSAURS. So when i saw the little dino i clicked on it and played. I played this game so much as a kid and when i saw this on steam,  im not gonna lie, i almost cried. For those of you who played this as a kid, on whatever website. Buy this game to support whoever made this and enjoy your own personal trip through memory lane.			",41,7,0,4,9,0,4

												Dino Run or Escape Extinction: The original Dino Run (also titled Escape Extinction) was released on the 30th April, 2008. In that time the game has been played over one hundred million times making it one of the most successful flash games ever developed.The original is still widely available… for FREE!: Although Pixeljam promises that DX has made significant improvements over the original it’s a hard argument to justify purchasing this over playing the original flash games. There’s additional game play options, more levels and more hats in the DX version of the game. Of course, Pixeljam have taken complete advantage of what Steam can provide for players – achievements, full screen mode, Steamworks integration,But what exactly is it? Dino Run bills itself as one of the first ever runner games. It’s certainly the first ever prehistoric runner game. The objective is to take your dino to the end of each level before the dreaded doomsday beats you to it. Once completely engulfed by doom your round is over. However, if you beat it to the end you get to continue. Of course, there are bonuses and traps along the way that will either aide you in your journey or hinder you. At the latter levels these traps can become immediately deadly. In the earlier levels they can still be deadly but you are given a little more leeway than you are later on. One of the best things about the game is that the levels are randomly generated. This avoids the pitfall that games can feel repetitive.Multiplayer: One of the major selling points for Dino Run DX is the addition of multiplayer and the level sharing feature. The latter, especially, gives the game a much needed shot in the arm and extends the potential of the game almost limitlessly. Of course, when you have a daily peak of just 8 players and an all-time peak of 74 you really need to increase that for the title to see the best that it can be.It really boils down to the value proposition: Are you a fan of Dino Run? Then this is a no brainer for you. You’ve likely already got the game or you didn’t know that it was on Steam – in which case hopefully I’ve brought it to your attention. If you haven’t played it before then I suggest you give the free flash version a try and if you like it by all means jump into the game and purchase it off of Steam. The value is there for fans of the game.For similar reviews and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/ ",2243,882,89,270,267,28,370

I named my dinosaur 'Childhood' after my experience from 2008. I'm glad to see that Dino Run has aged well.What's this game about?Dino Run DX is a two-dimensional 'racing' game created by Pixeljam. You control a raptor that must escape a giant pyroclastic wall of doom (thanks to the giant meteor) by navigating through all sorts of randomly generated obstacles and landscapes in order to reach safe shelter.Originally released in 2008, Dino Run was given a new coat of paint in Dino Run SE (Slightly Evolved) released in 2011 and given another in Dino Run DX (no clue what it stands for) released in 2015.Dino Run is a very simple side-scroller that provides an atmospheric and enjoyable experience with a lot of replay value.The game itselfControls are very simple, involving only the wasd/arrow keys to control all aspects of movement and shift to activate a temporary boost. The mouse is not used during gameplay.There are two modes: Challenge and Speedrun. Challenge is the 'campaign' mode where there are set levels and failed attempts can be reverted with a limited number of 'time shifts'. Speedrun is a simple run of a single level which may have unique modifiers applied to it.Each level starts off with the dino to the left of the level and the wall of doom following not too far behind. The dino runs into a variety of obstacles, environments, critters, other dinos of different species, dino eggs and powerups. Some dinos are helpful and some get in the way. How the level is laid out can either be randomly generated or created from a unique code that guarantees the same layout when used in the same run.Game modifiers can be used to further enhance gameplay. Try changing the sky into a nightly setting.Through experience, the dino can be upgraded with DNA, which is earned via saving eggs, eating critters and obtaining milestones.The dino can be customised with skin colours and patterns and hats. Some hats are unlocked via completing runs at higher difficulties.I haven't tried multiplayer so I cannot comment on that feature.VerdictThis game is an absolute blast. The bright and vibrant colours, great soundtrack and very simple gameplay form a very enjoyable and replayable game. I highly recommend this game to all sorts of gamers. If you don't want to buy this game but would want to try it out, play their original version on their website here[www.pixeljam.com].Personal commentsI've always loved the simple soundtracks this game offered. I never turned the sound off. I really wanted Dino Run 2 to get successfully funded, but now I hope the best for Pixaljam and their future projects (including and hopefully Dino Run 2).Thanks for readingKevinEdits:Renamed some sections and added some info.

												This game is just fantasticly simple and enjoyable! I started playing this when I was young and I'm still doing it! As I said, it's simple: just run, as fast as you can, to the right! How hard can that be? Well, it can be really hard. Just try the different difficulties, the speed runs or planet d. Also the exploring aspect is really nice. The maps are randomly generated every time you enter, so you'll fine new locatons every time, and I'm not even talking about the hidden super eggs you have to collect! There's also a multiplayer ability, so if you want to play with friends you can! All in all, this game is amazing! At least that's the opinion of this guy right her! :)			",76,9,5,1,16,0,14

												So this game was originally a browser game from 2008. I used to play it a lot when I was younger, I remember seeing these lobbies full of people from across the globe. I may like this game from nostalgia, but when I take a deeper look at it I think that this game really is a good party game if you will, one to play with friends. This game is also still available in the browser even if it has less functions. As of now the browser version seems to have a bug that doesn't allow new users or guests to join the lobby, but hopefully it won't be that long before it's fixed. If you paid for this game on steam you will get some extra features aswell as being able to play it offline obviously. In online mode there are two lobbies, one for those who bought DX on steam and one lobby where browser users and DX users can play together! Sadly this game's multiplayer isn't very active at all and you'll be lucky if you find a random person to play with, it's really best to play this with friends. The gameplay is fun, chaotic and intense. You are some sort of bipedal raptor like dino that you can dress up in different hats. Your goal is to escape the ever closing wall of doom that heads toward the same goal as you. While you try and get away from your extinction things such as meteors or herds of triceratops will be in your way. You will also learn as you play what the best way to accelerate is and how to maintain your speed. If you eat critters and collect eggs your speed will increase slightly as long as you keep it up, you can also gather power up flowers that give you abilities such as an extended jump, increased speed+/acceleration or one that allows you to destroy large obstacles in your path for a short while. In singleplayer you can also upgrade your dino as you gather points. I don't think I recommend this game for full price, wait until the slightest sale is taking place.Tl;DrVery fun with friends, can be partially f2p, has a semi dead multiplayer. Buy it during a sale.			",146,25,0,5,10,3,8

A Prehistoric Racing / Side-Scrollign Runner

+ The concept itself is great. You (and all the other dinosaurs) are trying to outrun the meteor explosion that caused them all to go extinct.+ Gameplay is very basic but a lot of fun at the same time. You are a raptor and try to get to the end of the stage before the ever approaching ""wall of doom"" from the meteor impact catches up to you. There are tons of obstacles that get in your way while you race to the end.+ Minimalistic but very creative procedurally generated levels with branching pathways + Many ""hats"" or costumes that pay tribute to a TON of different popular indie games. Super Meat Boy, Shovel Knight, Fez, Bit Trip Runner, Castle Crashers, Battleblock Theatre, VVVVVV, etc.+ Online multiplayer- Fairly short in length / amount of content~ Not many people playing online (I wasn't able to find a game)			",2899,1025,99,264,347,21,392

												This is just VERY similar to the original flash game. I bought it for having achievements to unlock, and that I was willing to pay for a better experience. Unfortunately, very little meaningful gameplay has really been added. If you really like this game, and are willing to pay the $5, I would say go for it. Just know that you aren't getting the most of your money, and won't see a huge amount of improvements. As time progresses, more and more improvements have and will be made.			",14,2,1,0,4,0,4

												How much can I recommend this?  I suppose it depends on how much you played the original.  Dino Run DX, for all that ""Deluxe"" implies, feels like an exact port of the old flash game.  Glitches, visual bugs and all.  These are things we were happy to put up with when it was free, but to pay money for an edition that doesn't really improve on it at all is disappointing.  More notable is the failure of multiplayer- indeed, it's essentially dead now, and all the ""players"" you'll see there appear to be kids using it as a chatroom.  When I say dead, I mean DEAD, by the way.  I haven't played a single online game yet, and doubt I will.Another negative thing about the game is the bizarre controls.  For some reason, your little dino doesn't control very predictably.  Jump height varies seemingly randomly, and goes off in strange directions, so leaping for tantalizingly placed eggs can be an exercise in frustration.  The result is that simply moving around isn't as fun as it should be.  To be fair, this is a problem with the original game as well, but it's a surprisingly big issue, as it cuts down on the replay value immensely for me.What can I say that's positive?  Well, it's cute, it's charming, it's lovely to look at.  It sounds pretty good, to boot.  The pixel art is a blend of the old and new - the pixelation and limited colors we might associate with old Atari games, but without any of the limitations, like those on sprite count or scrolling.  Dino Run is, well, a modern game in a cute pixel style, but it is important to note that as a 2007 release this game (and the studio that made it, Pixeljam) actually pioneered the style before most other indie titles.  There's a ton of hats to collect, eggs and special eggs to find, and it can be fun.  But it's hard to overlook its shortcomings when you're paying for it.Look, I'm a longtime fan of Pixeljam.  I love their art, music, and their games.  I'd like to see their games come to other platforms (Gamma Bros. on 3DS would be sweet - just sayin').  But I'm not really happy with the state of this Steam release.  I'm happy to have supported one of my favorite studios, but unfortunately this will be finding its way into my ""uninterested"" game folder.			",33,2,0,2,1,0,0

												I love this adorable game. It's simple, it's retro, and it's very fun. You are a dinosaur! You frolic through an idyllic, pixellated Jurrassic landscape! Suddenly, an asteroid hits! Now you must run for your life as a wall of unstoppable doom advances upon you. Dodge other, slower dinos. Eat the occasional worm. Jump over obstacles, duck under wayward pterosaurs, find secret giant dino-eggs, and time your speed boosts well. Will going over that hill, or ducking through the cavern under it be quicker? You only have a split-second to decide! Occasionally you may even want to back-track to discover a secret or grab a nice power-up -- but will you be quick enough to do so and still avoid extinction? There is a multitude of difficulty settings, one-off levels, weird cheat codes, and even multiplayer racing to keep the game very replayable.Also, the music is lovely. It's retro, but in a fun and enjoyable, rather than annoying way. You can even download the soundtrack from within the game, and I enjoyed it enough to do so.I am not usually a fan of running games, but this one is unique and just plain fun enough to get a big thumbs-up for me.

												This is my first review so I'm gonna keep it simple.Pros:+Huge nostalgia rush if you've played the game before+Huge sense of discovery if you haven't+Charming retro graphics and awesome chiptune soundtrack+No matter what your skill level, there's always a challenge you can attempt+Can provide hours of entertainment for a very cheap price+You can play it for five minutes at a time or five hours at a time+Plenty of secrets to discover+Friendly, approachable developers+Constant updates with loads more content on the way+DINOSAURS WITH HATSCons:-Multiplayer lobbies are usually very inactive-After you've played for a few hours you start getting bored of seeing the same bits of terrain over and over (though they will be adding more terrain chunks in the future)-The sound of the Doom Wall will haunt you in your nightmares-There's a few graphical glitches, and very occasionally you just fall straight through the floor (UPDATE: most of these have now been fixed)IMO this is a fantastic game, and whether you've played the original or not, it's definitely worth buying.

												Did you enjoy the old browser game Dino Run? Dino Run DX is the latest game in the franchise. In Dino Run DX you play as a dinosaur that is trying to avoid extinction. You must keep running in order to avoid the killer cloud of dust that is approaching quickly. Gameplay mostly involves continuing to run right and jump over obstacles in your way. While running you want to collect eggs and eat less fortunate creatures that are also trying to escape. These eggs and creatures are used to unlock additional content for the game. I had some fun with Dino Run DX. At first I found the game to be kind of boring but it started to grow on me. Dino Run DX will mostly appeal to people that enjoy runner games. Dino Run DX is not the type of game that I would play for long stretches of time. Despite having procedurally generated levels, the variety in gameplay rarely changes so you pretty much just keep doing the same things in different environments. If you really enjoy runner games I think you should enjoy Dino Run DX and should consider picking it up. Otherwise I would maybe wait for a sale on the game.Note: I received a free review copy from the developer. Read My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com] ",998,413,28,106,105,15,184

Then curse and scream when a dumbass stego blocks the tunnel you just ran into and you're both swallowed by the wall of death following you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												pretty sure a lot of kids have played this game in their younger years when it was still a web flash game. wasn't one of those kids myself, but dang it i'm in my twenties and i've been having a blast with this game.Dino Run DX has quite a bit more to offer than the web version. more levels, more polish, more gameplay options, and hats! if you haven't played it before, i'd highly reccommend trying out the web version for a taste of the action before buying the Steam version. it's pretty challenging and a heck of a lot of fun, and the devs are constantly working on updating the Steam version with more content and fixes and the like. if you've loved the web version, you'll probably really love the DX version.bit of a tip, though: when you install the game via Steam, make SURE the Steam overlay can be pulled up ingame, otherwise you won't get achievement notifications when getting milestones, and will be unable to unlock them again as steam achievements. the devs were kind enough to help me with this problem (bless u guys), but i figured i'd shoot a warning to people should it occur to them! if the overlay won't pull up, try rebooting your computer and running Dino Run after the reboot. the overlay should pull up after.aside from that, the game's a huge blast and i hope you enjoy it as much as i have. <3			",158,52,2,58,23,4,17

												Dino Run is a simple to play, hard to master, very polished racing-ish game with simple but quite pretty pixel graphics!The game has two modes: single player and multiplayer, and they have some differences.In single player mode, you have 4 difficulties to choose from, which take you through a set of levels trying to race away from the apocalypse and to the safety-cavern at the end of the last level.  You can find secrets and achieve goals to earn DNA (exp), and at the end of a level you can increase your raptor's stats.  Those stats persist between runs, so you can keep strengthening your dino's acceleration, top speed, jumping height, and strength (to move things around) to better succeed at the levels.  You can also collect bones which count as a sort of currency, letting you buy a neat handful of unlocks such as wallpapers and the game's soundtrack.Multiplayer pits you in a race to safety against other raptors.  It plays similarly to single player, but without the stats upgrading.  Instead, you have points you can gain, levels you can increase, which let you host higher-level races which give more points.  You can also unlock hats as you go!I played this game way back in 2008 when it first came out as a humble flash game, and happily bought up the special edition when it came out in 2011. When I heard about the DX release here on Steam the other day by email I was stoked! I had no idea this was coming out! Even better, I handed the devs a receipt of my old SE purchase and I got a free key! So if you bought SE back in the day there's no reason not to email the devs and ask for a key. :3As of this writing the game doesn't seem too different from its old SE release, but I understand that it's getting crowdfunded right now and early in the cycle. The first goal of DX was just to get it onto Steam; we'll be seeing new features and things added in in the comic months from the looks of it! I'd call it a worthy investment - and even as it is now, basically similar to the SE version, it's still as much fun now as it was back then.I've also created a Skype group for furs and furry-friendly people who want to play this game together - the multiplayer mode being quite fun, when you have people to play with! If you've got the game and are furry-friendly, then just drop me a Friend request and/or comment on Steam here asking to join. :3			",451,94,10,48,33,9,43

												I have played this amazing game since some of the earlier versions were out on other websites and I have enjoyed every moment of this game! The multiplayer feature gave new depth to it as it allowed you to go head-to-head against other players and show of your swag on the lobbies. On boring days I would spend hours completing challeges and getting trophies. Overall I would recomend this game to anyone who wants to not be extinct.Happy Running!			",53,8,0,4,9,2,1

												Don't be fooled by the simplistic graphics and pastel colors - Dino Run DX is a true work of multimedia art.  With some of the most inspired and cohesive storytelling and game design I've seen in years, it should win an award for best music, alone.  It may not take you long to finish the game, but it will be an incredibly intense time.Well worth the money.  Give it a go.			",125,16,3,39,22,0,19

												This random runner doesn't have anything spectacular to recommend it, but I do always enjoy taking the occassional jaunt through the last days of the dinosaurs. It's got a fun theme, secrets, and hats, and has just enough depth to keep me coming back to it. I maxed out my stats on the original non-Steam version, so now I get to do it all over again.Plus, it's a good game where you get to play a dinosaur, and how many of those are there? Too few.

												Nostalgic review commence.It's been so long since I've played this game that I've forgotten about it all together, but as soon as I saw it on a friend's wishlist,I instantly felt all the memories flowing back.I had so much fun with DinoCity that I felt like I was an actual caveman beating up dinosaurs just for fun.Killing scaly creatures was so satisfying that I even made a game called Dino Run, because I liked Sonic and DinoCity,It was truly amazing for my simple mind, I still can't believe I actually did something with my life.Just kidding, I'm a stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥ I couldn't make anything like this ever.But I did have tons of memories of this game, almost dying from a big black cloud of unknown substance.It truly spooked my idiotic self when I was younger.If you got some extra cash and some coolguys to play this with.Try it out, it's great for those times that you have nothing better to do, like 80% of the games on Steam.

												Played this game on my browser when I was much younger. Still playing this game. An outstanding indie game, I encourage any fans of retro themed games, dinosaur games, fast paced games, I reccomend this to you. An exellent example that yes, indie devs can actually make kickass games. +Outstanding pixel art+Entertaining, random, crazy gameplay+Now on steam, awesome!+Good for all ages, and skill levels+Not a very hard game to learn, but still requires some level of planning and strategy for things like challenges.+So many other great things! :DAnd if you write a bad reccomendation saying ""Ughhh I can play this game 4 free"" Go home, your drunk. Support this game, buy a copy. It's rather cheap! :DDid I mention it's got HATS? FOR FREE?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!? :O			",92,6,1,12,6,1,4

												It's not a bad game per se, but there are some luck-based shenanigans that rubs me off the wrong way; the dino doesn't feel like jumping at times, thus holes are death traps, stegosaurs and triceratops on steeper slopes are very annoying to pass by, and I would be near the goal, and some meteorite from offscreen land on me and I get caught by the doom.There's not much of a learning curve, and it's possible to get some fun in short bursts, although, I'm not really fan of its simplicity and, again, there are quite a lot of moments that kills the fun for me.

												Don't get extincted. The flash game is back and better than ever for a very reasonable price. If you ever played this game in its web-based flash version then spending a few dollars on this one is worth it for the occasional short term joy you'll get from it. Not something to play for hours every day, but a perfect time killer.			",166,20,0,19,7,1,3

												NOSTALGIAI remember those ancient times I played this online...And now it´s on Steam since 2014?!?! How could I have missed this?This might look ridiculous, but it´s one of the funniest and cutest pixelart games in my opinion. For me, Dino Run DX is also one of the first games I remember playing. My skills have decrased a lot since then, but I am still enjoying this. Of course, this is not a thing you can play for weeks and hundreds of hours, but a run is always fun! 5,99$ is probably a little too much money, but when it´s on sale it´s absolutely worth.THE END			",66,20,1,1,5,0,6

												Dino Run is life: You run straight forward as fast as you can to escape all the perils and there is no guarantee that you will survive. Orr maybe it is just a dumb flash game moved to Steam for some mindess enjoyment. When you are done, your reward is more running until you die a natural death doom catches up with you. Somehow a natural death is still more preferable, trust me, you don't want the doom. Jokes aside, I will offer a short practical review, and a longer more picked apart analysis. Practically, this game has a tiny community, but each match is short and since matches are managed by a host, you can start with anywhere from 2-6 players depending on interest. Often it will be just 2 or 3, as that will be the entirety of players in the lobby. No link to steam accounts*, so you will have to make your own Xgen account. This is a pixel game with simple controls that anyone that can play Super Mario Bros. can pick up with ease, albeit learning what does what, while optional, is helpful in regards to the plants. The cost... well it is a browser game so play it on the Xgen website and then make up your mind whether you want to get the Steam version. On a deeper level, I was only half-joking about my first paragraph. While I doubt that was the intended effect, the game does feel rather dark and pessimistic at times for those that care about the ambience, pessimistic in a way that reflects reality. A sense of one's very survival being so fleeting that there is no time to live, only time to fear doom. Such is adult life, and such it has been since the beginning of mankind. The music and atmousphere can be anywhere from mildly inviting to outright depressing. Of course, I doubt most players will really notice or be concerned about this part.*This has been changed. You can now log in with your Steam account.			",27,9,4,12,25,0,24

												Less than 5 minutes of fun for the whole family. Talk to strangers online!!! No really, talk to them. That's at least 40% of the game. Talk to absolute strangers and beg them to race you, because without them racing you, you can not level up, you can not develope your character further. This game was better in like 2009 when it was just a free browser game with an entire communtiy that was built around vast friendships and acceptance. Except that one pedophile that sexually harrassed like 15 users on Skype and took child pornography images of them via screenshot and forcing them to, ""Impress the head admin"" after picking them up from the chatrooms of your game. Hope you fixed that bug in the game.There is a lot of room for improvement here.Stop beating the dead horse and trying to make money out of something you already destroyed years ago.

												So much advertizing and positive buff I just had to buy it from discount. Was it worth 2€? Unfortunately, not to me. I can understand this game has some ""retro"" value for those who had played the original flash game at early age, but for newcomers, the game has pretty much nothing to offer. Gameplay is very, very simple and it didn't get me addicted at all. I don't mind the poor C64 graphics and music that much since I grew up on that era, but in this game, its too artificial without any lets say, style. Controls are also quite poor and the dino just doesn't jump and move very accurately or responsively. Surely that was the case in C64 era but today, I won't let it slide easily. 15 minutes of gameplay and you have pretty much seen it all. Will I ever return to play this? Maybe, because at least it loads fast and runs in windowed mode as default. It's quick to start and quick to close.

												So much advertizing and positive buff I just had to buy it from discount. Was it worth 2€? Unfortunately, not to me. I can understand this game has some ""retro"" value for those who had played the original flash game at early age, but for newcomers, the game has pretty much nothing to offer. Gameplay is very, very simple and it didn't get me addicted at all. I don't mind the poor C64 graphics and music that much since I grew up on that era, but in this game, its too artificial without any lets say, style. Controls are also quite poor and the dino just doesn't jump and move very accurately or responsively. Surely that was the case in C64 era but today, I won't let it slide easily. 15 minutes of gameplay and you have pretty much seen it all. Will I ever return to play this? Maybe, because at least it loads fast and runs in windowed mode as default. It's quick to start and quick to close. Perhaps this is a good game while you are waiting some big file transfer to complete or something but I've played much more addicting and better indie games like, lets say Limbo or Obulis that were definitely worth that 2€.

												I managed to get 40 minutes of gameplay out of this, and that was with two playthroughs. I only purchased it because of nostalgia from my childhood days of being too poor to play anything but flash games. This is absolutely identical to the flash version, I honestly do not know what they changed. This has randomly generated levels I'm pretty sure (it's hard to tell since you don't really interact with the environment all that much) and the original didn't, but that's a pretty useless feature in a game like this, so whatever. You COULD replay this enough to get your money out of it, but then you'd be a ♥♥♥♥ing crazy person or bored out of your♥♥♥♥♥♥			",81,13,0,12,11,0,6

												Sadly one of the weaker pixeljam games. Feels like it should be a free flash game. The only thing you do is hold right and jump at times. A mocking upgrade system fakes the illusion of free choice but if you do not upgrade speed every time, you will just not be fast enough to survive.

												I love this game, and I have since I was even younger than I am now. My best friend and I played it between classes, and now owning it and being able to support the devolopers is lovely. I love the addition of hats and skins, in addition to lowering the chance of making my save file more permanent.However, this game still has a couple of things to work on. In the first chapter while running in tunnels I often get a lilac colored bar across the top of my screen. My only other complaint is while the music is WONDERFUL (and I wish a soundtrack was available) I wish I was able to change how loud sound/music was, even perhaps muting it?Those small things being said, I am thrilled that this is now available on Steam, and I encourage you to purchase this. Even if it is a runner, it is still a delight to play, from the pixel backgrounds to the great music.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It has a very Hotline Miami vibe, but with more of a prehistoric tone.Plenty of levels, speedruns, and collectibles gives this game lots of replay value, but the multiplayer is dead.I was really looking forward to racing around the apocalypse with other people, that would have made this game so much better, but there's no one in the lobbies!

												It's been a long, long time since I played the origninal on newgrounds years ago. Yet it still holds the same addictive charm for me today as it did back then. You're a dinosaur the world is endingoutrun the end of the world win the game and party It's not quite an endless runner, in the sense that you finish most levels within a minute or so. But the levels themselves can randomize and switch up (and there's 2 other campaigns to run other than the classic) so there's still variety to enjoy.I don't think I'd really go out of my way to recommend the game as anything super-fantastic, but it's certainly a fun little game and worth some of your time and nostalgia.

												I played and enjoyed the flash version of this, so I bought the new Steam version. The multiplayer was a bit of a let-down, though. I was expecting the ability to play the normal campaign levels in multiplayer, together. The only multiplayer levels there are, however, are race levels (where two or more players race to the finish of a pretty short level). I was expecting a co-op survival type of thing, but I guess the racing will do.			",123,15,6,13,17,0,20

												It's been a long, long time since I played the origninal on newgrounds years ago. Yet it still holds the same addictive charm for me today as it did back then. You're a dinosaur the world is endingoutrun the end of the world win the game and party It's not quite an endless runner, in the sense that you finish most levels within a minute or so. But the levels themselves can randomize and switch up (and there's 2 other campaigns to run other than the classic) so there's still variety to enjoy.I don't think I'd really go out of my way to recommend the game as anything super-fantastic, but it's certainly a fun little game and worth some of your time and nostalgia.

												Simple, yet entertaining and kid friendly game!In comparison to their new game release ""Last Horizon"", there are a lot of similarities: - noticably little content (more on that later - there is content, and it is being expanded in this game)- simple yet challenging game mechanics- few stages to get throughBut Dino Run DX features more: - hats, lots of them- customizable dinos (color only for now)- online multiplayer, although very laggy for me (might have to do with the poor engine performance on slower computers - they are on it to find a fix I was told)- still in active development as long as funds pour in, so it can only get better- dinosaurs are awesome!So my overall judgement is a recommendation, as opposed to Last Horizon, as of today (shortly after launch of LH).

ONE-DINO DOVEBURGER APOCALYPSELong story short there was Dino Run SE for a long time, and the devs started a Dino Run 2 KS, but it fell through, so instead of trying another large-scale (heheh) project like that, they started upgrading the HECK out of the original. Same engine, same experience, new stuff to play with.Although the ""upgrading"" of the internal Flash Player (ye it's FL-based) has caused automatic anti-alliasing and problems on certain machines, but I blame Adobe for that♥♥♥♥♥♥ Hopefully they can iron out every last one of Adobe's ""features"" to bring back the old experience with new stuff. Sadly it's also the same fate as a lot of classic Flash games and vids. As relentless as PixelJam is, it's doubtful that these issues will remain indefinitely.""Wait, where's your actual review?""If you haven't played this game I don't know what you're doing with your life. You can play the old free versions on their site, MiniClip, Kongregate, NG, etc. It is Flash-based after all....Fine. A short rundown: It's a fun game despite its somewhat unrealistic physics (but it makes for hilarious results if you can wurk it). The skills you need to beat the insane classic challenge run will make the whole of the game quite enjoable if you dig these kinds of games. It's not casual, but it's not hardcore either, which is pretty refreshing and gives it a lot of replay value, kind of like Ori and the Blind Forest. Yes, I went there.The game's soundtrack has a subtle and proper blend of DnB, Doom Metal guitars, and Tribal elements. Not a lot to hear, but it's a small game. I hope to see it expanded in the future. Apparently the Halloween Hellrun comes with it's very-own soundtrack. Can't wait to get some files of it, too.			",126,9,1,2,7,1,9

												I first started playing this game when it was released on Miniclip back in '08 and I was immediately hooked. I liked the graphics, the music, I played it daily. Then after forgetting it existed for a few years, I stumbled upon Pixeljam's campaign to revitalise this game. Too bad Dino Run 2 failed, I guess. I honestly think this is better anyway. You can't really make a successful sequel to an endless runner without ruining it. I've had 15 hours of play in the last 2 days, so that sort of shows how much of a nerd I am. This new desktop version has an improved speedrun mode, with seeds, and there really isn't a need for cheats when you can enable and disable them on the fly in freerun mode. With good art, a nice soundtrack, and easy-to-exploit goodies links, I'm rating this game a solid 5/7.			",44,8,2,3,6,0,8

												I loved this flash game, so I'm happy to give the devs some money. It's beautiful, and the physics feel nice and sticky, like you're always fighting against boulders and other dinos. I wish there was proper controller support, though, so you could control the whole game from the controller instead of just your dinos - enabale it for the menus and such. Some of the cooler hats should probably need to be unlocked, but I can play as a little Sandman raptor so its cool.			",140,32,1,16,5,2,6

												This is such an addicting game. You'll start by doing a normal medium challenge, then you'll say, wow that was easy, so then you will try to do an insane run, and love the challenge, you will probably fail a few times but then beat the challenge run on insane. Then you are going to look at all the speedruns. You'll never finish with this game.			",59,3,0,3,1,1,3

												I played the ever living snot out of this game when it came out on Kongregate and got the Impossible badge which is like the All Gold Trophies but with the addition of beating all speed runs on Insane, so...GOOD NEWS! I survived my childhood, and Dino Run DX is just as good now as it was back then, and I'm looking forward to the many improvements they're making. Multiplayer is also really fun but still a bit slow because you're not there with us! The devs are super chill and love hanging out with the community and are very receptive to feedback and incorporate community ideas about upcoming features whenever possible.

Product received for free
												I've been playing this since it first released back on Miniclip in '08 and it's been interesting to watch it evolve as the players grew up with it. Both the game and company have been through a lot of growing to reach where they are now and the latest iteration (DX) is the culmination of every lesson learned along that path. With some old bugs squashed, new features implemented, and hats crammed into every nook and cranny you can find, it's no wonder that the game provides hours of entertainment to players of all ages. What really puts it over the top, though, is the responsiveness and involvement in the community by the developers that you just don't see often enough.Small disclaimer that I received the game for free due to doing mounds of beta testing over the years.

												Dino Run DX is the steam version of the Miniclip game Dino Run. While it does the same thing as the online version, the steam version has multiplayer and lots of customizables. It also runs much smoother than the online version and is a better experience for someone who loves this game. It's great for all ages and is a good time killer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really unique and fun game, you don't normally see a dinosaur game as good as this ( no offense haha ). Although the multiplayer lobbies can be a bit barren sometimes you can always pass the time in singleplayer. I really like how it looks in general, not just pixels but the landscapes are shaped realistically too. Freerun is great for me since I don't have to always chat in the lobbies anymore with my friends, good job Pixeljam, hope to see more updates soon!			",10,3,0,0,3,0,0

												I started playing this game at a very young age and I loved it so much. One day I was fortunate enough to come across it once again on steam and i bought it right away. It is so awesome to see how far this game has come since I started playing it so long ago. It is a very simple game but yet very addictive. I hope to play it even more in the future <3			",47,11,0,6,3,0,0

												It's been a long, long time since I played the origninal on newgrounds years ago. Yet it still holds the same addictive charm for me today as it did back then. You're a dinosaur the world is endingoutrun the end of the world win the game and party It's not quite an endless runner, in the sense that you finish most levels within a minute or so. But the levels themselves can randomize and switch up (and there's 2 other campaigns to run other than the classic) so there's still variety to enjoy.I don't think I'd really go out of my way to recommend the game as anything super-fantastic, but it's certainly a fun little game and worth some of your time and nostalgia.
