												""Roll'd"" is a really surprisingly fun game. I bought it due to my prefererence for SAS (short attention span) games and multiple levels to be unlocked with a gradual progression. Figured if I played for an hour it would be reasonable at this remarkably low price. After three days I have most of the achievements and have passed level 40 (of 50 for which achievements are offered.)The premise of Roll'd is that instead of the character moving, the path does. Perhaps a small change, but a very nice variation from the norm. At various points new levels and variations are unlocked, as well as new and bizarre ""runners"". The numerous paths may only be different in appearance, but they certainly look VERY different, and give the feel of not being at all similar in gameplay. If it's an illusion, it's a good one.The art and music of Roll'd are really nice, and all in all this is a remarkable game for this low price of less than a dollar. If you like dexterity or running games, Roll'd is certainly one to be considered near the top of the list for players of all ages.Thank you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Basic InformationTitle:  Roll'dDeveloper:  MGP StudiosPublisher:  Forever Entertainment S.A.Genre:  Endless runnerGeneral ImpressionRoll'd is a 2D casual game in the form of an endless runner but it features the novel idea of shaping and controlling the terrain and not the character itself. When you consider this game’s price and that it has both Trading Cards and Achivements, you understand that you have great value here. It was quite a fun experience in singleplayer and I bet that the MP modes are just as enticing. Both characters and tracks offer enough diversity with unlockables  and my only complaint to an otherwise unique game, is the monotony of the soundtrack. But that is just a minor inconvenience and it shouldn’t stop anyone from giving this game a chance to entertain them and their friends.Strong Points+ Uniqe type of gameplay.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points-  Repetitive sounds.Rating 8/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews.

Roll'd Reviewby David =DFUN, addicting, and plenty of content!Roll'd is a game that anyone could love, regardless of their gaming background. What really makes it fun, is local and multiplayer! What makes it addicting for me is the level system, and my desire to break personal records.If you are still hesitant about picking up Roll'd, please.. watch me broadcast... or something! This game really is worth picking up. ",177,57,6,20,16,3,25

""Like ""G-force"" on a rollercoaster""Roll'd is from the makers of the nasty games ""Timberman"" and ""Tiki-man"", but also from ""Surfingers"" which I liked very much. As simple as those mobile port games are, Roll'd also means to quick react, but this time you turn the whole track around you while your charakter is running on a fix position. If you enter a curve in a too sharp angle you die. Uphill or downhill doesn't matter. Speaking of characters there was once this half-animated Disney movie called ""G-Force"" with a pretty lame story but cute guinea pigs. Well some characters in this game seem to be stolen from that but it doesn't help to hide the massive flaws that are implemented. Balance Achievements of normal and hard seem to be mixedup, the upleveling is unclear and the randomly stiched together curves are sloppy rendered and have micro-gaps. You don't even know visually what you are doing wrong, only hear your pig squeaking. Ofc the game has also some nice feature like 4ppl online MP on splitscreen, a global ranking and again a bunch of characters to unlock but unfortunately with no other behaviour (just other skins). But to levelup to level50 can be a bit of grinding if you already beat the highscores in all difficulties. So you must force yourself through this endless rollercoaster to make it 100% in the end ...			",1637,665,58,135,164,17,216

												Simple endless runner game which is suitable to be played in short sessions when you are bored. You start as a pig character, running on a roller coaster terrain, which you will have to balance with the right and left keys to prevent your character from falling off to your death. With only 2 keys to control, it sounds simple but that couldn't be further from the truth. It has quite a learning curve, and in the beginning, you will die a lot of times within seconds of the game, making you want to rage quit and throw your keyboard / mouse at the wall. However, once you get the hang of it, the fun starts. You get to level up, and unlock more characters, themes / locations and difficulties (easy, normal, or hard). The variety is quite extensive, and will definitely keep you playing for some time.  The background music is a mix bag of soothing music to chiptunes, depending on the location, which sometimes may be annoying. Overall, a good game well worth the cheap admission price!

												Right off the bat, I wasn't sure what you think of the music.  It's nice, yet at the same time, it got annoying after a while.  I think the problem was mainly that it was the same music playing over, and over, and over again.  I finally ended up just turning off the music. There are multiple characters to choose from, but this is done via an unlock/leveling up system.  Map selection also goes off this as well.  It's really nice they offer it as a leveling perk instead of just ""You beat the course, here's an unlock!""  What's even better is that even if you die, you still get some levels depending on how far you got.  Considering I'm terrible at this game, that was quite helpful for me.The concept of Roll'd is pretty basic and fun.  Don't roll and you win.  Sounds easy, but it can be challenging, which is nice.  I really enjoyed this game, even if I kept dying.  One issue was that even if you were full screen, the actual game was not. It's weird because every other aspect about the game is full screen except for the actual gameplay.  I suppose it's not as big of a deal, and doesn't make too big of a difference, but it'd still be nice if we're in full screen to actually have full screen gameplay.There are actually quite a lot of high points about this game.  Controller support, Steam achievements, trading cards, mlocal co-op, multiplayer, and even cross platform multiplayer.  The developers really went all out on this game and made it very much Steam friendly.  On top of this Roll'd is only 0.99 cents.  Pretty good price for this.   I took a look at the developer interaction, and from what I'm seeing, the last developer to community interaction was two weeks ago, and that was simply to step in for a forum moderation role.  According to their Steam page, the last actual update was a month ago.  Given how little the developer is interacting now, it worries me that they've given up on this game.  If that is the case, it's a real shame, because Roll'd is very fun, and had a lot of possibilities.Positives: Character variety. Unlock system. (you unlock from completing or failing a course) Map variety. Fun concept. Controller support. Steam achievements. Trading cards. Co-Op. Multiplayer. Cheap.Negatives: Even in full screen the game itself is not full screen. Music gets annoying after a while. No updates in over a month, and communication from the developers has ceased.For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's, and check out our Curations.

												OMG! Got this game for 49 cents. Wow! Well worth much more. The sound of the pig's squel as he's falling is a bit haunting. It takes you a few tries to get used to it. And then you realize you have to keep the world rotated back and forth to keep it level for the poor pig. I love how he waves his arms around when he's starting to get off balance. It's cute! I sometimes have a short attention span and like how I can really enjoy five minutes (or less) playing this. Warning - it's kind of an addictive game. I love that they have different costumes for the pig. And different 'worlds' and from easy to hard difficulty. I've gifted it to some friends and they already love it as well. It's 49 cents! Why are you still reading this? Buy the dang game!			",73,24,8,5,4,0,1

												F'ing Roll'd.This is one of those endless running, two button games that could be a phone game but works just as well as a time waster on this platform, too.In Roll'd you control the ground you run on by rotating the track, its relatively simple at slow speeds but on higher difficulty settings it gets very hectic and infuriating, you will always want to beat your top score.Pros:+Good Soundtrack+Lots of runners with pretty solid animations+Around 50 levels with unlockables along the way+Great scenery+Good learning curve+CheapCons:-Glitchy menus-Repetitive Gameplay-Hard to find multiplayer games			",352,69,24,42,32,7,50

												This is an interesting puzzle game. It's kinda like the little marble you had to get through the maze/labyrinth toy or the old school Monkey Ball video game. You use the keys A and D to move the ROAD !, not the character.. up and down to make the character walk with as little effort as possible. If not, he falls off screaming in pain. An agonizing fall to his/her death... Witch can be funny when playing characters like Sir Dinkalot ( a pig). With Levels and themes to unlock during the game, by the more you play levels, themes and characters. The soundtrack was kinda of a retro 8/16 bit throwback. Nothing hugely catching like Double Dragon II  Escape into the forrest. butt fun. With about 25 unlockable skins/ 5 theme backgrounds and 4 difficulty settings, its a fun game to challange yourself. Makes walking or taking a stroll a little a-bit diffrent next time, if you think of it this way...			",77,12,0,17,2,0,18

The game is really cheap but I recommend adding 4-pack purchase option for people who want to play it with friends.Not sure what was inspiration for a graphic style of the game because it has really different characters and maps. It looks weird. One time I play as some ninja guy, and the oher I play as Limbo guy.Music is okay.			",497,142,22,58,47,7,65

Super fast and addictive gameplay Great minimal visuals Nice soundtrack! Cheap price!Cons No separate points counting system for each level types (only shows best of all time and not in this current level) Nobody is playing multiplayer...

Review copy provided from developer. Note that my ability to enjoy a game is not influenced by how I recieved it. If you would like to see the TL;DR, go to the summary at the bottom of the review.Roll'd is a simplistic endless runner with the same sort of novelty provided from games such as Timberman.The gameplay is, like most simplistic games, simple. You assist a variety of characters through a variety of different worlds by making their journey across different terrains horizontal (to some extent). You do this by pressing the arrow keys for keyboard and left stick for controller. Personally, I found keyboard to be the easiest way to control the game as it felt more precise. In regards to how fun this gameplay is, it's more the type of game you can jump into for 10-15 minutes to try and beat your old highscore. For a single dollar, it gives you a fair amount enjoyment. Roll'd has decent enough graphics, and an interesting idea of switching up the art style of each area you unlock which manages to keep it mildly refreshing. I did notice that in the second area, the graphics do not seem anywhere near as crisp as they did in the other areas.The music tends to get quite repetitive and somewhat annoying. The sounds (e.g. the annoying pig squeal played each time you die) were even more annoying and drove me to switch them off in the settings. The only other issue I had was with the fact that the game isn't exactly fullscreen once you start playing.Summary:Pros:✔ Fun game to pop in and play✔ Cheap✔ Decent graphicsCons:✘ Area 2's graphics aren't as high quality (minor issue)✘ Music & sounds get annoying✘ Not exactly fullscreenConclusion:Roll'd is a bit of fun to entertain you every now and then. Would I recommend it? Sure. It's a small dose of fun that costs you hardly anything, just don't expect too much from it.Rating: 6.6/10Did you enjoy that review? Make sure to check out my curator page at Sour Fruits United and/or read my other reviews. If you had any things you liked/disliked make sure to tell me in the comments below. ",326,126,8,34,24,3,39

Basic InformationTitle: Roll'dDeveloper: MGP Studios Publisher: Forever Entertainment S. A.Genre: Infiniti RunnerGeneral Impression This game is fully worth their $1, cause you could kill time to easily by just playing a game. I really recommend this game to you if you like playing games like Subway Surfers or something like that. You can even play online with your buddies that maybe live across the other world, or you can play Local Online where you share your keyboard with your friend and BAM you two can play together. This game is just lovely!Strong Points• It's an easy and interactive game• You can kill time with this game• The controls are very simple• Singleplayer, Local and Online is the game modes you can play• The maps does not ever end• It is a one of the best pixel games on steamWeak PointsThe games freezes when you open the game. Then it dissapeares when you quit and reopensGeneral RatingsGraphics: 8/10Atmosphere: 6/10Audio/Music: 9/10Gameplay: 7.4/10Story: N/AEngines/Mechanics: 7/10Personal Rating: 7/10Go get it <3			",113,33,1,14,13,0,14

												Very boring game. One of the reasons why I do not like is the game that you play a sheep, what makes pig sounds (Yes I know that you can play humans later.Whether it awful if you falling down, music stops and echo effect. Added gets you very little EXP on a Level  (What can actually come to addiction as there are many achievements where you have to achieve certain level). Graphic is the only thing what i like just a bit.Unlike other games where you get the Steam cards after a few minutes, you have here really wait a long time.If i sometime having pleasure to get cards or achievments and trying it here, than i get after 15 minutes no more pleasurable.Not recommended.

												The game starts up in full screen on the wrong monitor and the left arrow key is permanently on making it totally unplayable.  It's no big deal as I got it on special for 49c but anyone with a razor keyboard be aware it won't work.Today I grabbed an Xbox 360 wireless control.  Although it works with this game, the stuttering issue with the left arrow key is still present and the game is still unplayable.			",20,1,0,0,6,0,1

												Its the new geometry dash, just when you think you're getting the hang of it you make a mistake, i definitely recommend giving it a try if you want to test yourself :DAt the moment multiplayer is pointless because no one is on the game but once more people are playing i feel like multiplayer will be a lot of fun :)			",33,3,0,5,4,1,1

												This is a great time waster. If you have 10 minuets to play before your friends get online or you are waiting for your food to finish cooking. This game runs really smothly and I still havent stumbled upon any bug. For the price this game is at you will be able to get a great bang for your buck and you will not regret your purchase. This games make you set yourself goals to achieve and it feels like you are trying to get somewhere.Thier is one problme I have with the main menu, there is no way of changing your volum in game. If you do whish to turn the volume down then you have to go on to your desktop and change the volume of the game in the ""volume mixer"". Overall I really like this game as it is fun and a good way to wast time.			",32,2,5,5,4,0,4

												Roll'd is surprisingly challenging. Although you only use two keys, the learning curve is actually quite steep. Even the easy levels can be quite difficult at first. So if you get easily frustrated by that sort of thing, you might not like this game. I'd recommend it because it's the kind of game you can pick up and play, for five minutes or a couple hours. It's actually quite addictive. Steam achievements, along with a small price tag, make Roll'd a good addition to anyone's Steam library.			",5,5,0,2,6,0,0
