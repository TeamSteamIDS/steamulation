												This could be a serviceable diversion if the mobile touch controls where properly ported to the PC platform. As it is at least the cards offset the cost of this unplayable game when it's heavily discounted but unless you're a card nut, don't even bother.As long as it's profitable for these simple mobile ports to get on steam we'll continue to be inundated with unplayable garbage like this that's not worth your time at any price unfortunately.

			Crimson Duck are the Asset Flippers that are the subject of today's video. I was concerned to see that these people had somehow gotten 5 games onto the Steam Storefront!		

Congratulations to Crimson Duck for being our guest of honor on our most recent episode of Asset Flippers! Rage Parking Simulator is an asset flip, as are all 5 ""games"" currently posted by Crimson Duck. Please be aware of what shady business practices you will be supporting by purchasing such an awful game.			",169,78,2,44,23,2,29

												The controls are simply terrible. You have to use your mouse to turn the car, but in a perverted way: move the cursor on a wheel icon, press LMB and drag it. Normal WASD just won't work. Buy only if you suppose to get the money back with selling the trading cards.And if you dare to buy, prepare for RAGE.			",169,45,2,20,17,3,27

												Of all the games you could play, this is not one of them.The ""mixed"" reviews are a bag of rancid excrement; this APP stands in line to lick heatwave-swollen, chapped money balls with butt-sauce.  If there was nothing else to do with your time, I'd advise that you continue to do nothing, even if it cost more money, because this app isn't worth your $.50 at sale price.In fact, if someone offered me only $.50 to play it, I'd want to slap someone they care about.After the first 10 minutes of actual trying, my 5 hours ingame were spent idle, waiting for card drops, and I didn't ask for refund so that I could remember the shame brought on my family by thinking that this colossal gem of glimmering♥♥♥♥♥♥might entertain anyone, ever.If you buy this product someone will violate you in the unspeakable place.

												+Name serves the game right, but most of it due to the stupid controls- Controls are the most stupidest thing ever, only using 'W'? Steering with mouse in a little space?- Car starts also in reverse, that will crash always if you press 'W' in the beggining - this is where you lose more- Clearly designed for Mobile a.k.a. poor mobile port - It's a simple flash game, and it's not that difficult to pass it through- 'Stars' are useless, you can always go for the 1star that you will pass the level, and more stars doesn't earn you anything elseOverall - 3.5/10 ",1719,690,48,123,182,14,223

												I was very skeptical about this game, ah well, not disappointed:- sloppy controls - starting with the fact that you drive with a mouse pointer, this game would fit something like iPhone. It's not fun, I guess the controls was the main reason of why this is *rage* parking simulator, but it's not outrageous, it's just lame. In addition to that, the game has a slow reaction to your wheel turns - let's say you were turning all the way left if you roll all the way right, you will be still turning left for some time.- you have like 50 levels, every next level unlocked upon completing previous, so once done you get - points, stars, and coins. What are they for?  You have no place to spend your coins, points are useless since you get stars anyway and one star is 1000 points  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, even stars themselves useless because you don't need to collect some amount of stars to unlock some level, you unlock next level when you complete previous with any amount of stars.+Steamcards - if you buy this game with 90% discount you can cover the price, its free +1 to your library. Nothing more.- No steam achievements			",2054,823,59,208,220,16,291

												Rage Parking Simulator 2016 what can I say.  The only good thing I could say about it is it has 9 trading cards in the series, and you'll receive 5 cards at to trade.  About the game, well it's incredibly frustrating as you try and try then try a little more until you die and get in-RAGE.  Don't kill yourself after playing it though coz you might.

												(This game was suggested by Zaraki Snakenoman and given by Grabthegames.com.  Thanks, guys.)EDIT:  This review has been modified as of 3/24/16 to reflect the addition of new achievements...leading me to finish this game...Rage Parking Simulator 2016 is a Unity-based game that involves parking cars with awkward controls.  You will often find yourself crashing, especially if you give a d*mn about scores and stars.  If you want the achievements, you can easily get them in an hour, so I guess it's not TOO bad...  Controls include pressing up to activate the gas, down for the brake, clicking the gear to shift gears and a wheel that you have to click and drag to steer....like I said, it gets awkward.  What sucks the most is that you ALWAYS start in reverse...As said in my original review, Rage Parking Simulator 2016 feels like a free flash game and there's no reason to pay $4 for this experience...if anything, I can't suggest a price higher than ""Free"". 2/10  I'm disappointed in Steam for letting this title slip by and I'm disappointed in Greenlight for passing this game onto Steam with...very low standards.

												i don't understand who these people think they are making this game. You have to use the mouse to steer and the arrow keys to go forward. You have to click a button every time you want to switch between going forward and reverse. 90% of the time you spawn facing forward but the default is for you drive in reverse.you can park sideways in the stall or just have the tiniest bit of your car in it and still win. why. it's named rage simulator because that was a way to disguise the game being awful and like it was intentional. it makes you angry because it's stupid.if your friend buys this for you tell them to ♥♥♥♥ off  ",176,32,4,13,10,0,7

												Let this game be a reminder of how low you've stooped for 100% Achievements. Can be completed in less than an hour thanks to not needing to 3 star every stage. If one had to, the controls ruin the game. Turning speeds aren't accurate while the scale of the road is accurate. This causes a problem for a lot of levels when the game pretends it wants you to parallel park and you simply can't as intended. It's a joke game that is only worth playing for the Achievements and would be refunded immediately by most if it didn't have them. Oh, and trading cards.2/10			",1856,657,61,200,197,20,282

												This game is the reason Steam refunds are a thing.Now, you're probably telling yourself: ""It can't be THAT bad ...""It can.It is.Even worse.This is worse than bad. This is the worst. This is even the worstest of the worst. Turn back, don't even buy it to ""test how bad it is"".Why?- controls are IMPOSSIBLE - move forward with up key, i would guess down is for brakes, but in that case the cars use Fred Flinstone's feet as a brake. And I mean Fred Flinstone after a bad accident with legs disabled. That is how this game brakes.- you steer using a click&drag with a mouse!!! You click on a wheel and you turn it! MY GOD WAS IT SO HARD TO USE A/D or LEFT/RIGHT?!- you hit a wall - game over, you hit a cone - game over, you hit a curb - game over, you hit a car - game over ... I wouldn't be surprised if I drove trough a ghost of a dead girl and had the GAME OVER sign all over my screen- this game makes you hate itself, it really does. I mean ... you start in REVERSE! You have to click on the gear shift to go forward EVERY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LEVEL. It just screams HATE ME!- It's also not a Hideo Kojima gameThere are 9001 flash games of parking a car online. For free. And 5 times better done. If anybody has actually bought and kept this game, please contact me. I want to meet you and listen to your stories. You must live a very interesting life.

Yet Another Bad Game 2016Rage Parking Simulator 2016 isn't the worst game I've either seen, bought or played during 2016. It's just another one of those extremely bad games that was released in 2016 on Steam. Shame on you, Valve.Rage Parking Simulator 2016 puts you behind the wheel of a car and you must park it. That's it. Reminds me of those Java and Flash games I used to play in the early 2000's. A pretty neat idea and certainly a fun game to play... if the controls would be even a tiny bit better.Here's the thing. To accelerate you need to press either W or up arrow key and to break either S or down. Normally these games would have the basic control scheme like any other game that has been on the market for as long as I remember but no, not this game. You steer your vehicle with your mouse. Yes, mouse. That's pretty awkward sounding and oh boy does it feel awkward.While the only thing that is horribly wrong with the game are the controls they do feel like they are the only reason why the game could even include the word ""rage"" in its title. If the controls would be fixed, or maybe changed since I can't really tell if they are intentionally bad, the game would be rather easy game to play. At least I would find the game too easy.So, I guess Rage Parking Simulator 2016 is another one of those games that is hard just because of poor design choices. It's not hard, just... rage inducing.

												Really disappointed by this game.1. You start every map in reverse (seriuosly... who starts to park in reverse from the parkinglot entrance)2. Bad controls (your turning right and moving then when you shift to the left your still moving right)3. Dosent give you much option (just park wrong, right, or even perfect it dosent matter... youll still get the reward)4. This game has no tutorial or shows you the controls  5. The setting page for this game only lets you turn on/off of the sound and lets you see the credits6. You have to use the mouse for everything (turning and changing gears)7. you cant have your game on Fullscreen (Game will just change back to windowed mode) ",79,7,1,7,3,0,4

												Normally I wouldn't complain because I got it for free BUT I am. For everybody even thinking about BUYING this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game: DON'T!!! The controls are so horribly bad that it's unplayable. They are over sensitive and absurdly difficult to use. The constant switching between drive and reverse is annoying as hell and is there even a way to steer with your keyboard? I didn't find none of dat♥♥♥♥♥♥Listen. I get it. It's supposed to be rage inducing. GODDAMMIT! It's even in the NAME!!!Of course it is. But these types of game should also have some kind of amusing content that balaces out the frustration, being it the sheer ridiculousness of the premise (e.g. I am Bread) or the hilarious presentation (e.g. Surgeon Simulator).This game has none of it!PLEASE! Just let the fact that that I am saying (writing) these words with my dying breath (my hands) be a warning to all  you fortunate souls out there, who have never played this piece of garbage: STAY AWAY!

												Ok, never buy this game... I got it for 60 cents, so ok. But this is fine school work, demo. There is only one really big problem - yes, you control the steering wheel and switching back and forward movement by mouse. Not like in Euro Truck Simulator 2, where you steer by mouse, you have to click and drag the wheel to steer! And the throttle is by keys and only one hit is too fast acceleration, so it is almost impossible to play it like in reality, you have to press up and down arrows quickly to move only a bit and steer by mouse.Crazy and playable only in fullscreen.

Steering and change gear need mouse, while it could be done with keyboard. Steering with mouse is troublesome. Setting page only toggle on/off the sound, and credits.No tutorial, control mapping, etc. And default gear is R?? WTH. Need to shift it every time I start the level.At least, it has trading cards.

												Just when you thought 2016 was done shoveling crap into your life, Rage Parking Simulator 2016.  It's trash. It's specifically designed to irritate the player. The fact that you begin in reverse with obstructions that cause you to fail directly behind you makes that clear. There are obstructions that don't look like obstructions. The whole game looks and sounds very cheap and controls like dookie. When crafting a badge gives you a coupon, just save your 30 cents.			",138,67,2,8,6,1,11

												I have played a lot of games, but this game really takes the cake.  Made in Unity Personal Edition (which, there is nothing wrong with that...a lot of video game greats are made in Unity...look at Cities Skylines!!), this game looks, feels, and sounds like it was made in under a day by someone who decided to download Unity on a whim.  I don't mean to be harsh, or in any way squash creativity by any means...but wow?  Had I purchased this from Steam and not a third-party, I would have already gotten a refund.Now...the breakdown.  Let's start with the controls.  Oh, science...the controls.  CONTROLSWell, for starters, you use the arrow key(s)...really only one (up) to accelerate.  I THINK down stops, but you can't really tell.  It helps ease my mind a bit to think that it does.  Now...the steering.  Since you use up/down arrows to accelerate and stop...you would think you use left/right arrows to steer, right?  Nope.  Definitely not, you have to awkwardly use your mouse (yes, if you are right-handed like me, you're using your LEFT hand on your arrow keys) to turn this little icon of a steering wheel on the bottom LEFT corner like it's some kind of mobile game and accepts touch-input.  TO RECAP: You use your LEFT hand to accelerate, your RIGHT hand to turn with an on-screen icon on the LEFT hand of the screen.  I...but...you...it...*sigh*.UI/MENUS/STUFFOk, the UI is...well...awful.  Almost worse than the control scheme.  You're greeted at the beginning of the game with a MASSIVE play button that kind of blends in...but sticks out...but is low-res and blurry.You can see a pause button at the top left of the screen, a steering wheel at the bottom left of the screen, and a ""drive/reverse"" panel beside the steering wheel.  If you crash, you are greeted by a ""caution"" triangle sign, with the word ""gameover"".  There are 2 buttons on this screen.  One looks like the Ohio State ""O"" with a left arrow coming out of it...presumably to go back...and the other is a ""do-over"" button, which is much more clearly labeled.If you complete the level, you are greeted by a ""level complete"" screen, which shows you how many stars you obtained, your score (which seems to be an overall counter of all the times you played the game, not that level...even remaining through multiple opens/closes of the game), and ""coins""...no idea what these are for, where they come into play, or even how else to see how many you have OTHER THAN THIS SCREEN!The menu system is...weird.  You go back to the mission select screen, and you have 3 options there, ""help"", ""leaderboard"", and ""settings"".  The help screen brings up a small tutorial on how to play...the slider bar only goes halfway down though...not sure if there's more or if the slider is just broke.  The leaderboard is nothing more than the word ""SCORE"" with a cumulative score (just like in-game when passing a level) of ALL THE SCORES.  No breakdown, no way to determine how much you made per level, etc....just SCORE.  The settings is where it gets REALLY weird.  There's two options here.  ""Sound"" and ""info"".  Sound is a toggle which mutes...everything.  Not just the music, not just the in-game sounds.  Literally the sounds of the game.  Period.  All of them.  Info gives you the credits.SoundsI have to give some credit here.  Although the music sounds like a 70's erotic film or workplace training video and is blasting (headphone users beware); the car sounds aren't BAD.  They're far from good, but they're not bad.  When you turn, you can hear the turn signal, the car acceleration sounds are generic but solid.  The crash sound is abrupt and loud, but does the trick.Physics/CollisionThis is what ruins the game for me.  Completely.  This game is meant to be one of those frustrating, physics-based, pain in the tushy games where you get mad at your own fingers for betraying you.  If this was the case, I would leave it alone...but that's not the case.  First of all, hitboxes/colliders are BAD.  Not being a mobile game, and having very little art assets, may I suggest using a mesh collider as opposed to a box collider, so there is accuracy?  This will also allow you to use 3d art assets as opposed to just 2d sprites and may make some graphical things be cleared up a bit (if they're just a stain on the pavement or if they're a pylon/obstacle).  Some things you're not even touching yet, and you collide with them, others you can go halfway through before you collide.  This is literally the purpose of this game, this needs to be solid.  Here...take THIS IMAGE[images.akamai.steamusercontent.com] for example.  In what world is that winning, when the winning conditions are to have 4 tires inside of a parking spot without colliding with anything?!?!Anyway, here's the video of the gameplay...save your money and get a burger with a buddy or something, it will be a better use of your time and finances.

""Women's nightmare""Rage parking simulator is a simple but challenging 2D topdown view game. You drive several different cars into parkplaces rated with 1,2 or 3 stars. Points doesn't matter to beat a level. So try to park anyways. Sometimes the level end triggers quite slow. So be assure your car is not moving anymore inside the parkplace. You start always in backwards gear and must set it with mouse to forewards. The steering wheel also needs to be spinned over mouse into the right direction and degree. Sometimes the collosion engine is way too sensible. On other times it lacks of damage recognize (mostly sideways). There are only a few levels with an extra trailer which makes it slightly harder. All 50 levels are doable witin 1.5 hours.			",1637,665,58,135,164,17,216

												I could ignore lack of control options. Stupid controls. Awful graphics and music. Ridiculous loading when changing menus. But I can't ignore the fact that steering wheel doesn't correspond car movement. You steer far left and press Accelerate - car moves FORWARD and then turns left. So what's the point of rotating virtual wheel, if it's not simulating the one in car?Also car brake works too slow.			",1874,696,88,247,256,23,329

												Firstly, I would like to thank this group (in which I ""AccidentalyStumbled"" upon and now proudly a member):  AccidentlyReviewed* for giving me a key for this unique game for FREE!!!. Special thanks to Group Moderator  Sqverl  for making sure I got a working key. I really wanted this game but unfortunately due to its ""Negative"" reviews I held back (Yes, it is only  ~ a $ and even less if it is on sale, but, for me every centavo counts), luckily for me I was able to have it for free*. Now For The Review:As the game title suggests it is intentionally designed to make YOU start to RAGE (actually, I didn't get to that - it is really more of a challenge), the controls** designed to utilize KBD/Mouse combo is perfect, very responsive, and works as intended. Really, if you know how to drive and comfortable doing a parallel parking you could easily finish this game, experience in controlling R/C's is also a plus-making turns in different view second nature). And after finishing the game I really don't understand why there are so much negative reviews.PROs:- Simple graphics that is appropriate for this game. (A 3D version? - that might be more challenging than this one).- Responsive controls (KBD/Mouse is all you need).- Works as designed/intended e.g. the controls & its rage inducing mechanics (as the negative reviews shows).- Now when I'm in a tight parking space (this is now in real life) I just think of it as a new Rage Parking Simulator level/challenge! CONs:- Not really that challenging. (way too easy). - No steam cloud. you have to manually transfer your save file/s or just redo every level when you transfer PCs.- There are a few bug (see my  screenshots-read the captions).- **Got to unplug my other controllers (gamepad/joystick), even though there is a re-configuration option it doesn't seem to function right ... so, to simplify things I just unplugged them.- The game is too short! only 50 levels.Please visit  AccidentlyReviewed  group and be a member. And get FREE Keys for almost NOTHING! ... all they ask is that you not let these games gather DIGITAL-dust in your library!			",53,12,1,4,11,2,6

												They could make the controls easier, but they didn't. So it is pretty hard to control your car. Even harder than it should been. But it is probably their gameplay choice. Yet, I can say that it is pretty bad.Also, the game is really clunky. Although the physics of a car are actually well throw into this game, I can't properly say that it is a good game.

Controls are all over the place and really isn't natural.Respect for the Developers for making a game like this but it's really stupid that you're charging for a game like this. Why don't you try putting this game on the Mobile Platform , yeah?			",31,4,1,0,2,0,1

												Seems like a fun game for a phone to kill some time, not sure if it already exist on it or no but the controls look like they're taken straight out of a mobile game. Anyways, my main complaint is that it starts to get boring few minutes in and the requirements for passing the level are just funny. You can literally stand next to the parking spot or park like a first-timer and still pass it.A weak 5/10This game would trigger all driving instructors. ",203,42,10,15,12,1,17

My playtime: ~1.2h (based on steam, 100% achievements with no 3 stars on all levels ).Grindy Achievement: No.Optional Achievement: No.Difficult Achievement: No (depends on your patience, really).Developer Response: Never.IntroRage Parking Simulator 2016 is a ""simulation"" parking game. I said ""simulation"" because although it looks like a parking simulation, it doesn't feel like it. If you want to play this game to learn how to park, don't. Go play something else or just drive a real car instead.MusicThe music is okay for the game with this price.GraphicBoth UI and UX are terrible. I don't know how to close the menu. The help text is very small and it has a scroll bar. Fyi, the box containing the help box is way too small compared to the screen size, and the scroll bar can't be scrolled to the end. It's better to remove the scroll bar altogether and change the help text to somewhat readable. I bet the whole text will fit my screen.After you cleared a level, there is no button to go to the next level. You simply have to go back to level selection or replay the level.Although this game was made in 2016, the graphics look like an old game (and i think i recognize the images on one of the old games i played before).The gameYou have to park an automatic car to one of the designated spots. There are some spots to park your car into, and the difficult one will net you higher stars (maximum of 3). However, the controls are terrible. The gear starts in R gear (if you didn't know, it's the gear to move backwards) and there is no instruction on how to switch it to D (going forward). I ended up looking through the discussion thread just to find out that you have to click on the gear image in the bottom left to change the gear. It becomes worse as soon as you find out that you also have to drag the steering to left and right just to move the car to that position. The parking spot is also way too small compared to the ""normal speed"" of the car which will took you longer just to park the car. I'm sure that even if you can drive and park a car in the real world, you'll have to find a hard time to park it fast in this game.Pros:- None that i know of, except if you think that trading cards count as one, that is.Cons:- Terrible controls.- No ""go to the next level"" button.- No control tutorial.ConclusionThis is a terrible parking simulator which will make you rage.Should you buy this game?No.Seriously, it's not worth it. There are free games out there which is way better than this one. Don't waste your time playing this game. ",104,49,4,17,11,2,6

												Gameplay/First Impressions: 


YouTube™ Video: Rage Parking Simulator 2016 - Who Cares if you Park Like a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 

			Views: 33		

			Rage Parking Simulator 2016 is an obvious designed for mobile game. The controls are♥♥♥♥♥♥and you can just park like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and still win.		

A mobile clone piece of crap.First off, the car starts in reverse for some reason. Logically, you would use w to go forward, but that just causes you to crash, because you need to put the car in drive. I've never driven a car in any game that starts in reverse, except for this one.Secondly, the controls are crap. You need to control the car using the on-screen steering wheel, not by using a or d like a normal human would do. This on-screen steering wheel is clear evidence of it being a mobile clone.Thirdly, you don't even need to park properly in the spots. You can litterally only have the hood of your car in the spot and the game will give it you. Once you discover this trick the game becomes painfully boring as all the levels, (all the levels I played anyway), become super easy.To close, at least it did one thing right. I was very tempted to smash something in my rage, after I repeatedly crashed, because of poor controls. ♥♥♥♥ this game.			",747,192,19,67,63,11,81

												I got the game from some giveaway i can't remember at the moment. Out of the 5.4 hours on record i actually played the game for about 30 minutes (the rest were way before that, for the trading cards). So... what i achieved for 30 minutes?- 5 minutes of rage for ""Why the **** it always start at reverse? There is no point of that, except artificial frustrating of the player and extra click every level.- 5 minutes of rage because of the clunky controls and missing ""next level"" button. Why? It's like several lines of code to add that. - 5 minutes of getting used to the clunky controls, especially the turning part.- 15 minutes play passing the levels with ease after getting used to the controls. No rage, it actually became boring, way too easy (for 15 minutes i actually passed about 20 levels, most of them on first try).Overall - i can't recommend the game for this price tag. There are a lot of .99 games with way better game play and way way better ideas. I got it for free and i am not feeling bad, but i am not feeling good either. If you can get it for free or for max 50 cents - it may be ok for small time waster, but overall - it's not worth it.			",107,36,5,17,11,1,11

												Using this simulator, I lost my ability to drive real cars. However I have now mastered road rage, a skill that was previously unavailable to me as a nordic fellow.(Seriously, you needed Unity for this?)			",185,27,6,16,6,2,15

												Что ж, я поиграл в эту игру не так долго, но я понял - это лучший парковочный симулятор, который я видел. Все, кто ставят плохие оценки и отзывы - просто неудачники, которые не смогли припарковаться на третьем уровне. И знайте, что такое странное управление и резкий старт - специально задуманные разработчиком сложности, чтобы испытать нас с вами! Также эта игра должна приносить ярость, и она её приносит.Итог - 10/10, игра года, мастхев. Well, I played this game not so long, but I realized - this is the best parking simulator that I have seen. All who give a bad evaluation and feedback - just losers who could not park on the third level. And know that this strange control and sharp start - specially conceived developer complexity, to test us! Also, this game should bring a rage, and it brings.The result - 10/10, game of the year, musthave.			",36,4,1,7,3,1,0

												I have a driver's license. A real one. In game, I can pilot F1 cars with such ease as I can parallel-park a truck. I can flee a V8 cop car with only my hands.But this game is NOT a parking simulator. This is more like a challenge. It sits there on my library, teasing me for quitting on the fourth level.The game is... Cute... Not much more than that. The controls are unusual, to say the least. Although you can setup many keys, you'll only need your mouse and the W/Up key. Steering is done by clicking the wheel and turning it, while throttle is W. That is not unexpected, since this is a port of a mobile game. For a mobile game, it might've been something cool to pass time, but not as a Steam game, with bad ported controls... If this game accepted either controller inputs or allowed to steer using A D/Right Left, maybe, just maybe this would pass as a real game.PS.: Your car starts on reverse for god knows why. First thing you'll do is crash on the cones behind you. ",313,47,14,44,38,5,45

												Why Mixed?! Why Mostly Negative? NO! NO GOD PLEASE NO! This game is wonderfull! It stands for it's name completely: You get in, press w, game over... WHA?! FFFFFFUUUUU--! Then you notice that little gear shifter and a wheel next to it. You think: ""Aaaah, now i get it"". Then you drive around a bit, crashing and laughing furiously, trying to get those precious 3 starts, that's what game about: little space, awkward controlls, music that suggest you should be pedal-to-the-metaling on a highway, yet you need to park and go to motherloving mall! That's rage's quintessence :DGot it for ~6 cents, but would gladly pay few bucks, it's a fun game to make some burst fun, and play with your tongue out while you're trying to gid gud :D			",165,41,9,13,12,0,19

(well, at least 2 first ones...)Controls suck or are just inexistant, I had to use my mouse to try this car game and to control wheel.Game is absolutely not polished. I found an obvious UI bug. And once you completed a level you have options to restart same level or go back to menu. What about next level ?It just looks like dev just don't really care about releasing something playable. What kind of project is that ? This is just a scam.So sad of having bought their bundle during previous sale...			",916,391,26,137,132,18,149

												Ok, never buy this game... I got it for 60 cents, so ok. But this is fine school work, demo. There is only one really big problem - yes, you control the steering wheel and switching back and forward movement by mouse. Not like in Euro Truck Simulator 2, where you steer by mouse, you have to click and drag the wheel to steer! And the throttle is by keys and only one hit is too fast acceleration, so it is almost impossible to play it like in reality, you have to press up and down arrows quickly to move only a bit and steer by mouse.Crazy and playable only in fullscreen.

												I do understand the negative reviews and all that stuff. Rage Parking Simulator 2016 isnt a game for everyone. While I did enjoy it myself, I do understand why people would hate the game.The controls are made to feel realistic. I get the way they want it to be. It can get some time to get used to, but when you get used to the controls, it is playable. Though, these controls can be just annoying for some people. And I understand why. The steering with the mouse makes it sometimes difficult, but for some people, like me, I have no problem with it. The gameplay is simple. There's nothing much to say. Its your average parking game. Except that its made to be hard on purpose. It's not that bad.There is nothing impressive in graphical terms. I do like the graphic style of the game though.I don't have anything to say about the sound. It's alright. Rage Parking Simulator 2016 isnt a bad game. It's a good game, but it not a good game for everyone to play. Some people, like me, will enjoy the game, while others, just don't. If you like simple games, challenging small games or 2D games, give it a try. Though I can't guarantee you will like the game. It's really up to what kind of games you like, or your gaming preferences.  ",445,57,47,23,36,6,23

												*Honestly, I played this solely because I wanted to add another 100% game.- The games controls can be annoying at times, but I got used to them fairly quickly...used mouse and keyboard.  You use the mouse to click engage ""Drive/Forward or Reverse"" and the mouse to control the steering wheel.  You use the keyboard for movement - ""W"" to move in the direction the gear is engaged in, either Drive/Forward or Reverse and you use ""S"" to stop.- There are 50 levels in the game and most can be beaten to "" 1 star rating "" fairly easily.This is a good time to point out ""ALL Achievements consist of passing levels, no matter if you get 1 star or not, no need to push for 3 star if you are just going for a 100% game.It'll probably take most a little more than an hour or so to finish all the levels to a 1 star or better rating.

It's a good party game and comes with steam achievements and badges, if you wan't to boost your steam profile.+Fun game.+Good party game.+Pretty casual and chill.+Holds up to it's title (can get a little 'ragey').-/+ Bad controls, but may be good for a party (for example when drunk).-Some of the models look unfinnished.-Rarely you hit stuff that you actually don't hit.7/10 in that pricerange and category			",101,10,3,5,18,0,3

												Honestly, this is a good game. I see many people complaining about the controls, I agree, they aren't like any other game, you gotta get used to them.But they aren't horrible at all, they are challenging ! The only thing that isn't great about the controls is the steering, you need to kind of stop the car to be able to steer in the other direction, else it's not gonna work.=)			",192,51,7,14,7,3,20

												Poor game, created for mobile. Not recommended at all. There are better mobile parking themed games. I had to ""play"" two more minutes for review.

												Pros: - It was free?- Turning mechanics work as you'd expect; ie properly.- Braking isn't instant, they behave properly.- Simply touching a cone or whatever doesn't mean you ""crash""; you actually need to be traveling at a low-speed as you hit something for it to count or you need to keep driving into something for it to count... 5mph bumpers = success...Cons:- Most controls don't work; the ones that do are Accelerate and Brake ( and they work prior to the mouse being able to click anything )- There is a delay at the start of the ""round"" which prevents you from clicking on anything, but your car can move so you often end up crashing before you're given control.- There is no way to exit the game other than ctrl+alt+del ( if you're using single-monitor or if you didn't opt for windowed mode; for multi-monitor I'd suggest windowed mode because the mouse isn't locked ) because no menu option exists for it.- There is no way to stop the loud music other than turning off ALL sounds, but only 2 sounds exist ( music loop and loud crash sound ). - There is no way to alter controls in-game.- Car starts in reverse instead of park, neutral or drive but only Reverse and Drive exists.

												What the fudge is wrong with this game!?This game reminds me of the days when I was still learning to drive, when my father would always scream at me whenever I'm close into crashing the car.  The most frustrating part of learning to handle the wheel is the proper parking techniques, particularly parallel parking.  This game basically wants you to induce the rage by experiencing those frustrating moments, which the title heavily implies.  The problem here is that this is a video game, and being frustrated in a thing that's meant to make you relax and enjoy is the last thing that should happen.You complete a level by properly parking your car in one of the many slots in the carpark.  The more difficult the parking is the higher the score.  Through this mechanic another problem arises which is on how to complete the goal.  At one point I'm able to park the car but nothing happened.  The game didn't even tell that you're supposed to click on the star in order to complete the level.Adding to the frustration is the severe collision detection this game has.  Just a little touch to any of the present obstacles will spell game over for you.Here we have weird controls, where you use the mouse to control your steering wheel as well as shift gears, which only has Drive and Reverse.  Adding to the frustration is that the gear is set in reverse from the very start, so it's no surprising if your very first attempt at the game ends up with a game over.If you want to shave your hair then get this game.  You'll never need to go to a barber as you have pulled out all of your hair in frustration.			",107,35,3,7,3,1,2

												Not Recommended. Stay away from this game.Concept is okay. You have a car and you have to drive it safely to a parking spot without hitting anything and their are lots of stages.  But it has been implemented so poorly. There is no setting to change other than turning Music on or off. You can not drive the car by WASD or change gear with any key. You have to use mouse and rotate the steering on screen and change gears by pressing a button on screen. That is really stupid. I mean it's a good concept and this game can get way better by just implementing Keyboard bindings for all the controls. But no support from this developers. Don't buy this game. If the developers add this feature I'll recommend this game other wise stay away,			",48,7,5,9,7,0,10

												The idea is interesting and it was a material for a great game. I say was because this ""game"", I'm hesitating to call it a game! looks like it was made by a 1'st grade student. The controls are horrible! The car takes to long to stop after you stop pressing forward and the best solution is to go into reverse and try to slow down. The collisions with the game objects are extremely strict. If you barely touch another vehicle its game over. The worse part is that even if you park in the designated area it sometimes does not ""click"" and you end up having to park again and again...Don't buy this game, don't take if someone gives it to you for free!
