												I don't really know where to start on this one.  I was expecting a toned down version of the old school game Twisted Metal, but instead what I got was a mobile port of an endless runner, which uses a car instead of a character.  Your options are left and right to dodge, quick brake and attack; no accelerator or brakes, just keep moving.  The games main concept is to speed down a straight road dodging cars all while picking up coins, powerups and weapons; simple enough.  As you get further down the road, you will continually pick up speed.   The overall feel of the game was a port of an iOS or Android to PC which would have been better off as a Free To Play with micro transactions or a free web based flash game, not a full fledged PC release.With all this being said, the game does have it's own simple quick game kinda charm, worth playing if you have some time kill.  Without looking at the actual specs, I would imagine this game would run fine on most modern laptops with just integrated graphics and a modest amount of RAM, so might be a game for a long car ride or flight?  I dunno.			",753,169,38,47,55,9,58

												Forewarning, don't buy this unless it's on sale. Very short, very easy, warts and all port of a mobile game. Fun to burn time on, but I ""completed"" it in under an hour. The icons are very big, designed for a mobile screen and are very obstructive when played on PC. There's an option to buy in-game money in the car customisation section and I presume this is a leftover from the mobile version as the button does nothing. There's an annoying  song in the background you can't turn off, or down. No settings to tweak at all. It's fun to kill time on while you wait for something else to load up, but is otherwise a  pointless and small game that isn't worth the RRP.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the crappiest mobile to pc ports I've seen and lord knows there is a lot of competition in said area. Game is a simple endless runner that looks and plays horrible.To make it even worse you can't turn to godawful trashy music that's even worse than the crappy game itself. So in summation... awful game, get something else. Have a good one.			",2198,857,88,271,225,28,362

												If you're looking for a cheap endless runner inspired by Burnout, you can do far worse than Crash and Burn Racing. It's a game that's easy to pick up and play, although the music is a bit repetitive.If you'd like to see some gameplay, I've made a Bundle Buys video on the game. Check it out!

												This is a simple endless run game. Nothing is special about this game.There is no achievements, steam cards, multiplayer, leaderboard, etc.Just as the title said ""Crash and Burn Racing"", you drive a racing car to crash and burn other cars.But it's still fun to play when you're bored.

												If they added leaderboards and Steam achievements, this would be a really really great game.  But for now, it's a really fun endless runner game where you are a car!  The physics are just spot-on for a crazy-taxi-type arcade-ness, and the game itself functions well, there is stuff to unlock, etc.However the downsides is in the amount of content.  Sure you could unlock all those paint schemes for each car, but it feels grindy just thinking about it.  I only played for like 30 minutes, but I felt like I saw it all.  Literally there are a few different powerups to blast cars in front of you, and you basically see how long you can last.  The pace didn't seem to get more intense either, but I could be wrong.  I don't really see the 'hook' of why I should even keep playing.  So why the thumbs up?  Because this game is perfect for what it set out to achieve: an endless runner with a car.  Now if the developers have a chance to add in some functionality to give it replay value and they could gave a gem on their hands.  Wishlist: - Steam leaderboards- Achievements- Trading Cards- Steam CloudWill check back on this title later, but for now look at that price tag!  Day 1 release and it's like under $3 US.  This price point makes the decision to recommend to someone infinitely easier, I would hope everyone have this title in their library, although seeing as how they set the price bar that low you will probably have spare copies from bundles in a few months time.

												Few indie games capture the essence of gaming, It's a timing thing. A feel. An assault to the senses.This game has it.This game is AWESOME.Perfect for short breaks at work.I felt like I was angrily, happily, hurriedly throwing 25 cents into a slot, over and over.~~~ 8/10 ~~~ developer, keep working on this !!!

												-8/10-This is a very addictive game that gets you playing for AGES to beat your highscore. The graphics are not fantastic, but the gameplay is good, the driving is not stiff which makes for good gameplay, the song in the background is cool (i don't know about you, but when the beat drops  ALWAYS blow up a bomb :)  ) and it has cool power-ups. The other racers you encounter and have to destroy, just makes this very addictive!			",89,9,3,2,11,0,7

												Definite pass. Endless runner where you navigate a boring, poorly modeled car through 4 lanes of poorly modeled traffic. You do the exact same 1 level, with a continuous loop of the same mediocre dub-metal song, that gets old after the first time you play it. You can change wheel and color of your car, but it all does nothing. There are only 3 total pickups and they get old. Nothing changes. You constantly repeat the same level to slowly unlock new cars to use on the level. But why play with new cars when you're doing the same thing you've done 1000 times before. 30 min of playtime in this game tops.  3/10.			",452,80,11,25,16,6,21

												This game allows me to drive drive destructively. What else does a man want? Highly recommended if you enjoy racing and endless runner games. It has some very good upgrade systems, nice new cars to drive in, would be awesome if had some alternative environments too!			",84,29,3,11,16,2,46

												In this game you do not have to accelerate, the only thing you have to do is dodge other cars and collect money, powerups or bombs/rockets. The bombs and rockets can be used to destroy other cars and the money is needed to upgrade your car.At first ""Crash&Burn"" looks like a nice little casual game but after a while I was dodging cars for, what seemed like 30 minutes, in fact it was only 10-15 minutes but long enough and way too easy. I don't know how long the first level would take but it was enough for me to just crash and quit the game. Crash & Burn is not a bad game but it could be a lot better. Adding steam achievements and leaderboard would already be a great improvement but it would not be enough to keep playing this game for hours. I do not care about buying new car colours or upgrades in a game like this. Perhaps I will play this game again in the future but right now I don't see that happening.  ",1619,636,54,225,180,17,281

 Not even worth the $1 from the Bundle I got it from The game goal is to get cash by destroying other cars so you can unlock other parts/cars. To do this, you get the help of random bonuses that spawn on the road. While testing the game on Steam Big Picture Mode with a xbox 360 controller, the first 4 plays were quite nice, but then I started to note problems. The cash wasn't updating correctly, the level is just a highway that keeps repeating itself, and the music...wait...just 1 music for the whole game ?? I mean, its the same one from the main menu...and the same one from last race...? Sure, I like dubstep (it's a good song for the game), but not over and over again...Well, if the game was in early access, I would have given it a chance.Discussion Hub is rather empty, noted some users with some other strange problems.While trying to quit the game, I found out there is no quit button. I had to get off the couch to get my mouse and keyboard!!! (The horror!!!!) Oh, and there is no reference what the controls are for the game. Figure it out youself.It reminds me of a just lauched free mobile game without the ads...So this is a game to avoid, not worth your time or money.Graphics: 6/10Gameplay: 4/10Sound: 2/10Final Result: Would ""Crash and Burn"" the game again.

												Quite possible the most addicting game I've ever played on my computer. I physically sat there for half an hour and just played and played. For a small game like this, that's a lot of time. It's sort of like Temple Run, but with cars, explosions and awesomeness.			",338,91,18,24,36,3,29
