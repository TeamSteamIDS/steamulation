												First off, I've had iRacing for years now, and I was one of those in the early days of owning it to blow my load on all of the content, so I do know where I am coming from here.I vote no, the price is NOT justified, it's actually a WORSE physics experience than Assetto Corsa for a start, but lets give a full list of the reasons why I would NOT recommend this game.1. The Physics : Whilst they are more realistic than most of the games people are used to this can barely be called simulation, whilst things have improved and continue to improve, the game lacks fundamental tire model elements that would define this title as a simulation. Fundamentally the iRacing engine is based off the Nascar Racing 2003 game engine, which in turn was based off the Grand Prix Legends engine of 1997. So in a nut shell this core engine is almost 20 years old. The company themselves and most definitely the players and community like to believe the simulation models tire wear which it doesn't, all it models is that an overheated tyre is a slippy tire so basically one or two sideways moments in a lap, requires potentially 5 corners afterwards on knife-edge oversteer to let the tires cool down again [exactly the same game engine tyre properties that were there on GPL] - which in real life just isn't the case and if you're used to real life racing physics and simulation you will be fighting the car on corner entry as braking and turning on iRacing seems to overwhelm the game engine and generally send you into a low speed spin, again something that wouldn't happen in real life. Despite these short-falls they are more interested in variable weather conditions than fixing the core issues of the game engine.2. The Price : Under no circumstance is the price of this title acceptable. Not only does it require monthly subscription but also the purchase of tracks and cars. Enjoy racing the skip barber on the North American circuits? Well next time they release a new track you can be it will be on the skip schedule almost forcing you to buy it. You don't 'purchase what you want/can' you end up being forced to make purchases whilst being given the impression it was the customers choice. 300$ plus change for all of the content. For a game? You'd expect such a price for a high end commercial simulator, but it's not, it's a nigh on 20year old game essentially and for this, it's a joke.  The tracks are the service's most acclaimed piece, but realistically they botch their laser scans, the Monza oval for instance is in no way in a scanable condition, so they have essentially just created a track on the fly, not to mention the 'tech tracks'. Lets not forget, iRacing aren't the only ones who laser scan tracks now, do Assetto Corsa charge extortionate amounts because they laser scan their tracks? And IMO do a better job of it. You can get just the same enjoyment at a tenth of the price with Assetto Corsa, or even rFactor 2 if you find a private LEAGUE to race in, rather than just trying to join some public server full of wreckers and then complain about the community of that game. Anyone who tries justify the price I garentee has most, if not ALL of the content and feels that natural urge to protect their investment [I mean nobody wants to feel like an idiot for spending 300$ on a video game do they?] which brings me on to point 3 .3. The cult : After spending so much money on iRacing for all of the necessary content people in the community then have this natural defense mechanism on their 'investment' and will defend iRacing on all levels unjustly, refusing to listen to logical critique and hyperpraising things such as the tracks [one of the things they love to do is pretend that iRacing models tire wear, which it definitely does not].tl;dr you pay 300$+ to get the less overall enjoyment with substandard physics than you would in a private rFactor 2 or Assetto Corsa league with. Do not confuse immersion with simulation guys! Shiney tracks and a decent public service still do not justify the price!			",131,9,31,1,20,1,14

												 Motorsport isn't for everyone, when i was younger i only liked fast cars because i thought they were sexy.Now after years of watching various Motorsport series' and Sim Racing along the way my perspective has changed. iRacing requires a change of perspective, you cannot come in as a fan of race cars and expect excitment.You have to be a fan- no, a follower of Motorsport. Someone who holds that passion at heart for Great racing. The more you love Motorsport the better iRacing will fit into your life and becomes a Hobby that trandsend general gaming in terms of long term enjoyment.In the beginning for me the buisness model was very odd, after buying stuff like rFactor, Race07-Evo etc then playing those over time it was the weirdest thing to pop up and i was one of the decenters. ""WTF is this- etc"" Then after a few months things became shockingly clear, rFactor, Race07 etc weren't updated.... iRacing was.Simply as that my mind changed as i realized they were in it for the long haul, every season iRacers get an update, Big or small it either adds content after months of development or more functionality with tweaks etc. Every $ i've spent in iRacing has been worth it, over the years we got pieces of content bit by bit and with so much more to come the list is getting bigger. To look at iRacing now with fresh eyes the money added up must be daunting, for me i waited impatiently for months and years in some cases for a Track/ Car to the point that the $12 i payed for them over the course of months was nothing. Anyway. iRacing at its core is a Motorsport Simulator, so excitment comes in spikes just like watching F1 these days.The first few laps are crazy and exciting then things settle down a bit with some sparatic fighting with a decent climax at the end.  When you are the one in the car this dynamic is the same but there is an added challenge, getting er done.You're responsable for the outcome of your race, if you make a mistake you suffer the consiquences, if you're slow it's up to you to learn more and improve.  Everything is up to and on you.As a result overall it's a fantastic challenge, to start from the very bottom and make your way up that ladder, from fighting scrubs to meeting people on your level then above. Over time iRacing becomes less and less of a gaming dynamic and more of a forum for personal improvement.Either way in the end as a fan of motorsport, facing the same challenge as the drivers i watch on track has added a fantastic dynamic to my life. To watch F1 then run a race with 35 people from all over the world at the very top is superb.Challenging, Exciting and Fulfilling.			",48,11,1,5,11,0,2

												 Honestly the only real competitive racing sim out there. It has it's downsides, like being too expensive, but you really get what you pay for.If you just want to hotlap some cars and try stuff out, play with your friends on the weekend, there are better options.But if you want to truly compete and feel like you are progressing your career as a ""virtual race car driver"" this is the one and only game you could play.

												Best online driving by far but once you realize you can only do 1 track/race without starting on your first of many many many many purchases that you need to buy to progress in any way shape or form,  basically the game costs about £1000 to buy all the content,  you can't earn it you can't progress to it you must buy,  From a game that charges a monthly fee??,  it is the biggest con i have ever seen.  Please don't bother with this.   We should never encourage blatant extortion.   The people behind this game are the most greediest individuals the world has ever seen and should never be encouraged,   also the fact they don't make it clear that your monthly fee will only let you do 1 track that they pick at a time.  Is nothing short of criminal.  Fact is they know its a con that's why its not made clear when you first subscribe that your goanna have to pay pay pay to do anything worthwhile,  total con  shame on you for taking advantage			",7,3,4,0,7,0,3

												So, it's not often I'm wrong, but I have to admit how wrong I was.After giving the game another 5 or so hours under the tutelage of a veteran player who showed me the ropes, its quite honestly a marvel of a game. Thats not to say there arent some issues, as there are, like a dated graphics engine, in game purchases for expanding tracks and drivable vehicles as well as having a limited pool of cars to drive. But all in all, an excellent Simulation that doesn't pretend to be anything its not. You just have to give it some time and love and it will give back.50 hours in: Had a number of issues purchasing iRacing content through Steam. iRacing support very helpful. Steam support completely lackluster. Been running the Global Challenge series in the Cadillac. Looking at working back through the Skip Barber series and on up to the Star Mazda series. Also, to get the most from this game, you ""have"" to use a steering wheel and pedals. Controllers just dont cut it!Original review included for posterity, ""Pretty average game. Confusing web interface that keeps asking for steam approval. Waste of $39.""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Internet racing is a fun, easy, and inexpensive way for race fans, simracers and gamers alike to enjoy the thrill of the racetrack "" - This is iRacings description of their game.  I'm going to break it down. Fun: YES! The level of courtesy and professionalism of drivers in this community is unparalelled.  It makes for very fun, competitive, and thrilling racing.  Even in the Rookie leagues, the number of drivers that care about the safety rating system is absolutely untouchable by any internet racing community.  AC is good, but not this good.Inexpensive: ABSOLUTELY NOT!  Talk about a money pit.  It's not only a monthly/yearly subscription, it's also a LITERAL F*CKTON OF DLC.  Once you have ascended from the Rookie ranks in this game, the cost increases dramatically.   As of yesterday, the total for all content in Rookie Class and Class D is $580.61 (including a $193.54 multi-purchase discount).  Class A, B, and C continue to add to the DLC money pit, but I'm going to skip the calculation.    Granted, there are a few cars and a few tracks that come with the subscription.  However, the price of each track or car is between $12 and $15.  For instance, the 2007 version of Daytona Intl Speedway is included with subscription, but the 2011(?) version is not. Nurbergring Nordschleife and the Grand Prix Strecke are separate $15 purchases.  But remember, it's only $99.99/yr, which is more than some racing sims without subscription fees and all DLC combined.  For that amount of money, they better have something better than the terribly clunky and slow web UI they currently implement (Read: it launches sessions from a website and it's terrible sometimes).  The fact it's based on a game from 2003, which has been continuously modified, doesn't justify the cost of building models and the level of physics/particles. Also, if you want to race against your friends - for fun - you need to rent server time from them, or just hope you get matched in the same race.  Absolutely no fun for those who want to race with friends.Easy:  No.  Just no.  Winning is not easy.  Driving is not easy.  Proper car setup (not done in Rookie class) is not easy.  The tracks and drivers are challenging.  VERY challenging.  With that challenge comes reward, if you do well.Race fan, Sim racer, and Gamer alike:  I don't recommend playing this game with anything but a proper racing wheel.  Not for the gamer who just wants to create spectacular crashes.  This game is for the serious racers and the community reflects that.  If you're into just watching, they have a youtube channel that broadcasts the races, and they could really use some of those sale profits to increase production quality there.  It sounds like 12-15 y/o kids trying to sound like overly professional and dry race announcers - except one is in the studio and the other is voice chatting over skype.  You watch the races from the same cameras and jerkyness that comes from the instant replay cameras that you get in game (like a single person is just operating it to watch the race).  They desparately need someone who has worked in broadcast to help ramp up the production value.  Words cannot describe how terribly boring and unprofessional these really are.Overall:  2/5.  The community and safety rating system are the only things holding this game together, imho.  Besides them just now (March 2016) updating to DX11, the cost of DLC, terrible web interface/sever load, being based on a game from 2003, bad broadcast production quality, inablity to race with friends, and subscription costs are enough for me to hate the game.  I got a yearly subscription on sale for $30-something, will not buy any DLC due to cost, and own a racing wheel.  The only reason I ever come back is to race with people who aren't starting wrecks like bored children.Edit: Added costs. Emphasized sh*tty server load/webUI. Added comments on (not) playing with friends.  Lowered overall score.  I also recently purchased an HTC Vive - it seems that iRacing has completely removed their VR support (even oculus), so that is yet another deal breaker for me.  Technically no racing sim supports the Vive, but that's not to say I don't have some of them working.Edit 2: They've finally re-enabled VR support...  For Oculus.  There are many trying to get it work on the Vive with ReVive injector, to no avail.  For those wondering: Assetto Corsa (with ReVive), Live for Speed (native), and Project Cars (native) are all working with the Vive at this point.  All are much cheaper ways to race.Edit 3: (late) Now with Vive support.  Looks great, is very optimized, and is even fun.  Still, after forgetting to cancel my subscription, I'm currently trying to justify the $99 I just spent -- I just can't.			",115,29,18,6,23,2,19

												After a very long wait iRacing is finally on Steam and im very happy especially them giving out keys to existing members.This game is subscription based which I don't mind by having a subscription it shows that the members are serious about sim racing I normally do my subscription for one year when they have there subscription's on special.

Content - you do start out with some cars and tracks i personally can't remember what you start with its been so long but iRacing has uploaded some pictures on the store page of what you get, is the content expensive yes it can be if you buy all the content like me, but if you buy only what you like it's not so bad, but keep in mind all tracks are laser scanned so from every bump right up to every building is modeled into iRacings tracks, this also goes for the cars they take hundreds and thousands of photos video and sounds to bring cars too life.I have been a member for over two years and easily have over 1000 hours of driving time plus I own every piece of iracing content all cars all tracks and this includes tech tracks.I won't sugar coat it this game takes a very high level of driving skill and great deal of time to master it's not easy especially someone who is coming from an arcade game this game is pure simulation.I used to use iRacing for practice when I had my real race car and iRacing was good place to practice, Now I no longer race in real life I still play iRacing its great challenge with a great large community.

I personally recommend using a wheel and pedal set to play iRacing but you can use it with keyboard or game pad etc I personally find it near impossible with keyboard and you can achieve good results with game pad with practice.The racing is as close to real life as possible and some times your lucky enough to brush door panels with real famous race car drives, there is a full licence structure and also system to report deliberate rammers if you find one, in two years of play I have had three rammers.You can personalise your cars to make them who you are and using Trading paints you can upload custom paint jobs for example maybe upload replica of your favorite race car or create your own in Gimp or photoshop or use pre made ones on Trading paints or use there in house paint system possibilities are endless.Car setups are highly detailed and represent their real life counter parts this takes time and practice to learn sometimes the smallest adjustment can have great change, but if your unsure about setups when starting in rookie you can visit the forum and grab a pre made setup from a fellow raceror use iRacing pre made setups  or race in fixed setup race's.I recommend this game only if your into full simulation racing but I think iRacing should offer one month free so people can try before they buy

Each season is 12 weeks long with 1 intermittent week between each season. Throughout a season, the tracks being raced change every week. The way race sessions work is on scheduled times. So let's say you want to race in the 4:00pm MX-5 Cup race. You register for that race anytime before 4:00pm and either join the pre-race practice or just join the race session when it starts at 4:00pm. Simple as that.Depending on the car you want to race, there are mutliple series to choose from. Your license class determines what series you can participate in. Your iRating determines the split you are put in to keep the competition even. Some series are for fun and do not count against your iRating or safety rating. You can join open practice sessions at any time where safety rating is not in effect.THOUGHTSI have been a part of the iRacing service for 5+ years now. I was never really into any racing games prior to that nor ever cared to watch anything of the like on TV either. I was more into the CS competetive scene and just other FPS games in general. Shortly after trying iRacing I was hooked and got into watching F1, WEC, IMSA, V8S, BTCC etc. I never realized how exhilarating wheel-to-wheel racing could be. iRacing is hands down one of the most competetive video games I have ever played. There quite simply is nothing like it in comparison.I love absolutely everything about this game. It is constantly improving and it is the only racing game with fully sanctioned online championships and series. It costs a subscription fee and requires you to purchase new cars and tracks if you want to race in the more advanced series, or you can just pay the subscription fee and only race using the base content. Provided you race the majority of a season in any series that is D license or higher, you can receive in-game credit to use towards cars, tracks, and your subscription fee.I joined a rental kart league in real life after about a year of being on iRacing and in my first season I placed 4th out of 39 people whom most of which had much more experience than me in real life motor racing. I owe it to iRacing for teaching me certain skills that I was able to transfer over to a real life scenario. If you have a wheel and pedals, please just do yourself a favor and give the game a try. If you don't, then consider buying some if you're looking for a different form of competetive gaming. Look for promo deals online if you don't want to pay the Steam price. There are places where you can get 3-month subscriptions for $5 or sometimes even free trials. You can link any iRacing account to any Steam account.

												There seems to be a lot of confusion on What iRacing is.  Although it's commonly called a 'Racing Game', it is really a Simulation Service.  You don't own the program, you purchase the rights to use the content.  Very little of the program is stored on your computer, as most of it is handled by the iRacing servers.  Why no 'trial version'? Well server time cost money, and hosting a solely massively multiplayer experience that is constantly improving is very expensive. However iRacing does provide a 50% one time discount for new members.  You can try the service for 1 months for $6.  not a limited scope version, but the total service!  If you are not sure if a dedicated simulation service is for you, it's a good way to get your feet wet.    However if you are willing to invest in iRacing (yes invest, like any Adult Hobby it cost money to play) Coming from R/C Racing, and knowing others who race full size cars, this provides a similar experience with greater convenience, and much lower cost (over time). For example one race Day at most R/C Tracks is typically $5-$20 USD,  If you only ran 20 weeks (once per week), at $5 USD, that would equal the price of one year of iRacing which provides 52 weeks of unlimited racing.  In terms of Graphics, sure it's not the prettiest sim on the market, but if you are truly looking for a motorsports sim, then this probably isn't a priority for you. But because the graphics aren't there, that means more processing power can be focused on physics (where it is paramount for a sim) Gameplay, it's a steep learning curve. It starts off simple with Fixed series early on, but the setups get detailed quickly. Each car handles specifically, and it takes some serious seat time to be competitive. You will want to put in several hours of practice before your first race. For the best experience a mounted wheel and pedal setup is ideal (approx. $350-$500+ setup providing on the equipment you get and if you build your base to mount your equipment. There are several How-To guides available to us as guides for building your rig. However you can get by with a wheel stand, or just mount the wheel to your desk and have the pedals against the wall.  You can use a controller or Keyboard/Mouse, but it will limit how far you will go, because these mediums do not allow the precision required to drive some of the higher powered cars.  The cheepest route is buy a hybrid wheel/controller (ie Microsoft Speed Wheel)  The MS Speed Wheel requires the XBOX 360 Dongle for PC to work, but will give the best option for someone not ready or able to get their wheel/pedal set in the beginning.  Physics, can be summed in two words, NOT FORGIVING! this isn't like the Sim-Lite, or Psuedo Sims, where you can make mistakes and easily recover. Mistakes can be costly (even end your race, if it's bad enough)  RaceRoom Racing Experience is pretty close in terms of how unforgiving iRacing is for mistakes, if you want to get a general idea.Community is the one area there isn't one competitor has yet to truly compete. iRacing has some of the nicest, helpful, well mannered, and mature drivers overall out there. The ages range widely, and most are dedicated to a few disciplines. The iRacing Forum (only open to members of the iRacing service) is a wealth of knowledge, with shared setups, tips, hints, and other helpful advice. There is a place within the service for League Racing outside of Official iRacing Series.  But the community thrives because at it's foundation is the iRating and Safety Rating. A driver's iRacing is a numeric value of your skill as a driver (max is 10,000 iR) This is what the iRacing Service uses to match you with other drivers with a similar skill level.  The Second, Safety Rating, is how clean you drive. So if you put tires off track, spin out, hit a wall, or another driver, you gain 'incident points'. Each incident point counts against your Safety Rating. Each event has a maximum allowed incident points per driver. Typically it's 17x (or 17 incident points) . If a driver gains the maximum allowed incident points, they are disqualified from the race and removed from the track.  So those drivers you have to deal with who constantly wreck others? they are typically Disqualified.     The other factor Safety Rating has, is it determines what series you are eligible for. Safety Rating Class License are as follows: Rookie, D, C, B, A, Pro.  For example, to run in the GT3 Series, you have to hold and maintain a B-Class License.   Yes Maintain. Outside of Rookie and D Class License, you can lose your License Class, if you drive recklessly enough.  It's not a perfect system, but it's far superior than what is offered by other programs on the market.In closing, IF you are looking for a Simulation First Service, which takes a time investment to be fast (like in real life) loaded with other like minded individuals. And a service which provides matched racing to YOUR skill level, iRacing is for you. Just keep in mind, there is NO Single Player career experience.  Many on the iRacing Service use Psuedo Sims or Sim-Lite games for this activity.  However if you want to just jump in a variety of different cars and race all over the place and run quick with minimal time in practice, this is probably not the direction for you. I hope you find this review helpful in determining if iRacing is for you.			",17,0,16,1,4,1,2

												You can find the best online races in iRacing. HOWEVER, it is expensive as♥♥♥♥♥♥($75 per year + $15 per track + $12 per car). Tracks change weekly so if you want to be able to play every week you have to pay $12 for a car + 8x $15 for every track in the season. That's over $130 (not including the monthly fee) just to be able to race in ONE series for 3 months. Thank god they change the tracks every season so you will have to keep buying until you have basically everything.Now if I spend a fortune to be able to use the service I would at least expect some sort of performance. But their website (which you have to use to join races or do almost everything else) is the slowest pile of garbage I have ever encountered. Every click takes at least 10 seconds until you see the desired effect. It is like Battlelog for Battlefield - but 100x slower and with a clunky and ugly interface.Furthermore driving feels like you are driving on ice. The force feedback is really bad and once you realize ""Damn, I am about to spin!"" it is already too late. In games like Assetto Corsa, rFactor 2 and Automobilista you feel what the car is doing and anticipate. In iRacing you can simply react and hope for the best.The only thing iRacing got going for it is the clean online racing. Races are competitive, close and fun. But my god, they make you jump 20 hurdles until you can finally enjoy this game. Once you are finally on track and only have to deal with the bad force feedback it is enjoyable - but it is certainly not worth its price tag.One can only hope that their monopoly on clean online racing will collapse someday. Because right now we are stuck with only one mediocre, expensive and annoying solution.			",149,29,23,21,44,2,17

												iRacing is undoubtably a decent sim, but it is a cash cow for the developers... I believe that the monthly subscription cost is overpriced... Not only that,  then you have to pay for subsequent cars and tracks as well which for me kills it stone dead. Buy this sim only if you've got money to burn. There are plenty of other sims out there, all with equally decent aspects that don't rip you off, so go for one of those instead.			",350,92,50,42,101,1,85

												I have had the game for three weeks now and im really addicted to the game. They have a great racing community and vast variety of cars and tracks to choose from. If you played forza and other racing games this game is way different and gives you a real simulation feeling. Since Feburary i had joined two leagues and got the thrustmaster TX Racing wheel which really helps with giving you the feel with great reaction speed and llevel of force feedback.			",1,1,1,0,4,0,0

												I'm an iracing member since 2009. Whoever is reading this, I know what your biggest concern is you think iracing is too expensive. But hear me out I subscribe on cristmas for $49 per year, during this year there are 4 seasons, in each season you can earn $10 by just participating in championships, you also get $5 anniversary credits, that leaves you at a price of $4 per year. This might seem as squeezing pennies from you but it is done because the iracing system works better the more regular participation there is. You might also need to buy a few tracks and cars but how is that different than paying $50 every year for the same F1 game from codemasters for example. The only difference is codemasters charge you every year for the same crappy content while in iracing they release new content every 3 months and it is bloody awesome - laser scanned tracks and cars. It may not have the flashiest graphics effects but the laser scanning ensures that now you can feel every little bump and see every little detail of the track. The cars are build with real life data and every single one of them feels different to drive.And the content is not even the best part of iracing - it is the one of a kind multiplayer system. This is the only place where you can have close, clean racing with random strangers. The racing courtesy is close if not better than in league racing thanks to the safety rating and the protesting systems. And while in league racing you can have a race each week, in iracing there are races all the time and in all kinds of series - oval, open wheel, gt, vintage etc.Currently there are about 40 different series separated in 6 license levels - rookie, D, C, B, A and pro. Everything in rookie license is free and comes with the basic subscription. You don't need to worry about buying cars or tracks until you upgrade your license. To upgrade it, you need to be a safe driver i.e. not participate in many incidents. Each type of incident has a different weight. Going off track is worth 1 incident point, losing control=2inc. points, heavy contact with a track object=2inc points, heavy contact with another car=4inc points, the light contact with cars and objects are worth 0 inc points. Every next license level has a steeper requirements for the amount of incidents you can score. If this system is not enough to keep the races clean you can also protest any deliberate wrecking, blocking or cheating to the racing steward who can give out punishments.			",8,1,10,1,3,0,4

												I started iRacing about a year ago. I was always into racing, but never could afford a decent wheel/pedal setup.I found out about iRacing right before my birthday and the idea of fair internet racing fascinated me... so i built myself a rig and jumped into the world of online racing. Ill sum up some of my expiriences with the simulation in this review, trying to give you some insight on how your view will change when you get better and better.Prior racing games/simulations:I've been driving the oldschool NFS titles (the old Hot Pursuit and so on) and some F1 titles, but always with a game pad so i had no prior wheel expirience approaching iRacing (hell, i didnt even have a driving license at that time).My first weeks at iRacing:I started out with the Mazda MX5 which is free from the beginning and got right into the frey. I started a privat test session and drove a few laps, quickly realising this was not comparable to anything i had ever driven before. I immediatly learned that you have to invest time in iRacing to become save and good enough to drive on a racetrack with others. And thats before you even think about doing competetive laptimes.While this is a starting obstacle you have to overcome it is also deeply satisfying to finally get into your first race after proper training. I started out of the pits and propably was driving on my own at the back of the field, but i did my first race and the feeling when crossing the finish line unharmed was absolutley great.I went on to practised on and quickly climbed through the license levels. Getting from Rookie to a D license was my first big acomplishment and i was proud as f***. :PAn important note about license levels: They are not about how fast you are, they are about how save you are! That is a huge difference. I'd rather have a slower driver in the field, who has his car under control instead of a guy who is quick as hell, but will most likely crash after 5 laps. If you just keep your nose out of trouble and work on your driving skills, advancing from Rookie to an A class driver is not that hard.My driving expirience now (about 10 months after my initial start - by now i am using an Oculus Rift DK2):I am having an absolute blast. Really. I don't even dare to call iRacing a game anymore, its a racing simulation and it does an incredible job. I am mostly driving the GT3 cars and i actually am quite good at them, being able to drive highly competetive laptimes. I can still get the other cars around the track, but i wont win a race in them.Putting my focus on a single car helped me to become a very save and quick driver in the GT3 series. I shifted from the official races to Community leagues and am now mostly racing endurance events with 4hours + racing time with my teammate.There are some races where i crash out, there are some races where i get taken out, there are some races where i just hotlap for half an hour because everyone else is either quicker or slower than me. And then i have those amazing 45 minutes battles other drivers which are at my exact pace. And everytime i am in such a race, i have a huge idiotic grin all over my face when im done. Its just such a great feeling when you are driving close to your limits and have a fair battle with someone else. You will litteraly start to shake and sweat and when you are leading a race for the first time you might become so nervous that you drop out of your chair. And it feels great!Even now i still get nervous at starts of big, important races. When im standing somewhere in the mid-front of a 60 car field at Spa and am waiting for the Safety car to drive us through the warm-up lap i still shake. In my mind i am already racing down the hill towards Eau-Rouge and get crazily excited. I remind myself that ive got a 2 hours race ahead of me and that i only have to survive the start. The engines start spitting... and everything from there on is in my hands.TL;DR: Here is a list of what i love about this game and about what is a little bit annoying.Pro:+ Great physics, really fun to drive+ Good graphics (and they will become even better)+ Friendly Community on the Road side, i dont know much about Ovals+ Amazing, clean races (yes you will crash at times, but thats racing my friend)+ A huge track pool and a lot of cars that feel completly different from each other+ An extremly high level of competition at the top+ Racing with people that have your pace, no matter if you are super quick or just having a chilled sunset drive+ The amazing feeling that you actually achieved something, when you win your first race after hours of training+ In deep setup building (the faster the car, the more options you get)+ The game sound (way better than AC imo).Cons:- You will have to invest training time to become good, but training is also fun, especially with others on the track!- iRacing is not cheap, but in case that you cant afford real live racing, it gets as close as can be.- Its adicting.This review sounds really positive does it? Well, thats because i am absolutley in love with iRacing. I spent 200+ hours in the BMW alone and i am not the quickest guy yet. Time to head back into a practise session, cya folks!

												This game has practically zero Steam integration.You need to register a separate account for the game, and launch it through your web browser.Beyond the rookie league (which you need to get out of in order to enjoy the game), all cars cost money, and all tracks cost money, and you need to buy at least 1 car and probably around 5-8 tracks, racking up a cool $100 in addition to the subscription fees.If you're OK with all of this, though, the online racing experience is the best you can get.The graphics, however, are surpassed in most areas by other games (though iRacing has a lot of great trackside detail others lack), and the physics are... weird. The game updates its physics quite often, but not across all cars at the same time so some cars behave better than others. During loss of grip, the feedback in this game is quite poor, so it's more difficult to counter than other games. I had to use real world scale FOV and headtracking in order to improve this.If you really want a super hardcore online racing simulator, I do recommend iRacing. But not through Steam.(If you want better graphics, just as good if not better physics and laser scanning, but a bit worse online, I highly recommend getting Assetto Corsa instead, which will also save you a lot of money.)

												[PS showing a low number of hours played due to only just getting a Steam key, been on the service a couple of years pre-Steam]Quite simply, iRacing is the best online racing you'll find anywhere. RFactor 2 is a better sim, Assetto Corsa looks prettier, but neither has the quality of racing you'll find on iRacing.The Safety Rating system, while not perfect, means that if people drive badly, there is a consequence. This generally keeps people honest, along with a protest system that allows bad drivers to be coached, warned or removed from the service. Meanwhile iRating gives everyone a reason to keep racing, unlike in a typical public server where one often finds that anyone not in a battle for the lead disappears on lap 3. Finally, due to the new car/track combo each week and regular races structure, most series you can get a good race every hour on a track you and your competitors will have practiced on, compared to most public server racing being either a 3-car field on a track you don't know against guys who also don't know it, or everyone racing on Spa in touring cars.I've had some of the most extraordinarily fun experiences in iRacing, the adrenaline rush beating fellow competitors knowing how hard they work to beat you, knowing that some of them are VERY VERY good (admittedly some aren't), is like nothing else. Sim racing is the best thing you can do with your computer and iRacing is the best place to do it.In short, not the best sim, but by far the best racing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Realistic, competitive, multiplayer racing. It's what other racing sims try to be. Instead of worrying about perfecting an AI, the developers of iRacing have spent their resources creating real tracks down to the smallest change in pavement with 3D laser mapping technology. The effort that goes into their services is astonishing. But in the end, iRacing is hard to look at as a ""game."" It is a subscription-based simulator service originally based on the engine of NASCAR Racing 2003 Season. If you are looking for a game similar to Need for Speed, Burnout, or even other racing sims, iRacing may not be for you. The subscription model requires you to purchase cars and tracks as you advance your racing license, awarding safe and competitive racing along the way, and this has been a major turn-off to a lot of non-simracers. Similarly, you really need a racing wheel to be competitive in this game. Wheels are not cheap. Playing with an Xbox One controller, I can do fine in rookie class, but when I advance to race in sanctioned series within Class D, I struggle greatly to be competitive. In a world where your setup means everything, people who play with a wheel/gearbox/pedals simply are at an advantage. And there's no reason to nerf that to compensate for the people who go into this game expecting to dominate with a controller. I am perfectly content to participate with a controller, fully aware that I will probably never win a race. The fun comes from fighting the car to stay off the wall, avoid crashing into your opponents, and run the best line, lap-after-lap, in an attempt to keep it together long enough to see the checkered flag.For me, as a huge fan of stock car racing, these aformented things are all things I liked. There are very little things I dislike about iRacing. The tracks and cars are great, the compatibility with controller schemes and layouts are some of the best, the community is excellent (there are a lot of good sports out there), and the game itself feels like real racing. The stock livery editor is decent, and you can expand it infinitely using programs like Paint.NET to customize your own paint scheme. The things I dislike are mainly nitpicks, such as that I wish there were more tracks offered in the rookie class races. I wish there was a larger variety of series available to low-level license holders that use more of the cars and tracks included in the basic membership. But honestly, that's it.In the end, iRacing wasn't built for Steam. It was built for racing enthusiasts to go against one another virtually without the risk, cost, and other factors associated with racing in real life. If you aren't a racing enthusiast or a simracer, iRacing is probably not what you're looking for. There's nothing quite like iRacing. DISCLAIMER: As you probably have guessed, I primarily play iRacing on oval tracks. I have ran on some road courses and most of my review remains relevant, however I can not speak for a lot of tracks or cars that are in the game as I am not investing in advancing my license rank outside of oval series. I'd almost certainly need a wheel to do that.EDIT 11/26/2016: A few months ago, I picked up a racing wheel - the Thrustmaster VG Ferrari 458 Italia Red Legend Edition Racing Wheel - and it completely changed the way this sim handles. If you can, get a wheel. They aren't thousands of dollars anymore, I got mine for less than $100 and it completely changes the experience for the better. The cars handle so much easier, it's easy to be competitive, and it just makes it so much more immersive and enjoyable.			",52,6,16,8,12,0,2

												It's a great sim, but be aware how lacking it is for the price.  You only get a few cars and tracks to start with, and have to pay over ten bucks if you want more.  Strangely enough I was able to purchase the game with my steam wallet, but when I wanted to get another month It wanted my credit card information.  I will most likely look for a new sim until they add the ability to practice by yourself without paying 13 bucks a month.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best motorsport simulation that exists. Period.Bear in mind, I'm not talking about a ""game"". I'm talking about motorsport. If you are expecting an experience similar to Forza or other games in that sense, you'll be bewildered at what iRacing is offering. iRacing isn't as much a game as it is a motorsport simulation. From licensing to competing in various series, iRacing is more about long-term development as a driver than it is about jumping in and just winning races like you'd do in Forza. You won't win your first race. You porbably won't win a race in your first 30 starts. You're going to have to work at it, and thats what makes iRacing special.There's a couple major things you should know;1) You'll start in a rookie series with other drives learning to drive. It can be chaotic, but focus less on simply getting out of the rookie series and more on improving your driving craft. Over time, you will develop and once you move out of rookies you will feel much more confident in the higher license levels. The driving is more predictable in the higher brackets as well.2) If you intend on playing the game with a keyboard, or a gamepad for that matter, you are not going to have a good experience at all. You NEED to use a wheel/pedal set. You simply won't be able to properly compete (or enjoy the game for that matter) without a proper setup. Whats the point of immersing yourself in a motorsport simulation without taking that first big step and using a wheel? Trust me, you'll enjoy it so much more.3) You will be slow. Practice and you'll get better, I promise. As a rookie, you'll only have to master one or two cars, and only a handfull of tracks. MASTER THEM! Once you do this, QUALIFY! If you are finding that there are tons of wrecks all around you and you're getting caught in them, qualifying with a lot of practice will often put you near the front of the pack, and the wrecks will safely happen in your rear-view mirror. 4) Use the forums! Honestly, there are a ton of super helpful people who are willing to help you. Especially when you start to learn about setups and making tweaks to your car. The forums are a HUGE asset.5) Don't get frustrated! Practice! The results will come. If you have any questions about iRacing, don't hesitate to ask by commenting on this review. I will respond and do my best to help you out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												[Just got my Steam key but I'm a 4 year+ member of iRacing]Coming from someone's who's played a lot of different racing sims and racing games in general. Absolutely nothing compares to what iRacing has offered. Personally, I have countless hours played, a rough guestimate would be in the thousdands. I've raced at the ""professional"" level in the top series. Nothing quinches the thirst of racing quite like iRacing. Well anything that is actually affordable at least.Here's my list of things that makes iRacing stand out.Pros- Most competitive racing available anywhere- Cleanest racing you will ever find on a game- Races are 24/7 there is literally not a time where you can't race- Laser Scanned Cars/Tracks- There's always something to do, goals to accomplish- Most realistic physics out there- Closest thing to driving an actual race carCons- Pricey. There are other sims out there that you can get cheaper. None of which offer what iRacing does, - Well should have labeled this conExperienceI have and continue to choose iRacing over any other racing sim. Nothing compares to it. I've raced in the NASCAR Peak Antifreeze Series on and off for a couple years. Competed in the 2012 and 2013 Pro Series. 4 year + active member. Lastly I have over 950 official starts and currently ranked inside of the top 25 active ""oval"" racers.			",64,3,22,6,20,2,5

												As a member of iRacing since May of 2009. I would not recommend iRacing in its current state.The physics are far from great, something that was (okay) in 2009 but to todays standards they are far from good. That said the online pickup racing is probably the only reason worth having iRacing right now, but even with the pickup racing being a plus, the lack of choices to run do to most cars being just about completely undrivable on the Road side, and on the Oval side the only time there is a decent amount of people to race is if you wait until a series is at Daytona or Talladega. Which is a shame because of the sheer amount of laser scanned tracks that are pretty amazing most of the time. And dont get me started on the community, most of them have their heads so far up their own asses they can barely get out of their own way on the track. Pros:-Easy pickup racing.-Only up to date Sim to race Oval racing at the moment.-The web based interface is nice most of the time.-Laser Scanned TracksCons:-Sub-Par Physics.-Lack of Offline play, (Nothing at all).-Most of their big event crash the servers and then end up getting canceled.-The Community-Lack of choices in series to race, (do to lack of participation).All in all I give it a 4/10 in its curent state as of 3/23/2015			",120,19,16,8,8,2,4

  Introduction                             I would like to start this off by saying I'm not a huge racing game fan. I loved the Forza games and that's how far i went into the racing sim genre. That being said I thoroughly enjoyed my time playing iracing. As I launched the game for the first time I was brought to a web page that required account setup and a few other things. This game has a web lobby similar to battlefield’s battle log. I’m not a huge fan of these types of menus, but the devs integrated this very well. Once i was finished figuring out the web interface, i went into a game and was faced with another set-up. Since I'm not huge into racing sims i had some trouble with setting up the controls for keyboard and mouse. I eventually got it working and it was a blast learning how to race the tracks the correct way. I plan on going back and learning more tracks.   Pros                Great Cars  Racing is smooth  Graphics are nice  Tons of cars  Tons of tracks  Competition is tough  Real life events recreated in the game  One of the top racing sims available  Racing Seasons     Cons               Keyboard/Mouse Support is not the greatest  Menus can be hard to navigate       Conclusion                                 This is a the top of the line racing sim and is packed with tons of features. If you are a racing fanatic or trying to learn cars/driving better this is the game/sim for you. It does not get any better than this amazing racing sim.   -HiPFiRED If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

												""""""EDIT have added an update at the end... """"""I will start off by saying that I was put off from buying this game for over a year due to a couple of reviews.. now i appreciate a small % of bad shouldnt count considering the amount of blazing reviews.. It was because all the negative comments all stated somewhere about the cost..... like most i am not a millionaire and cost is always a factor in my life... so i stayed away from iRacing.. I found a promo code giving 3months for $5. So I thought i would give it a go... Will skip a bit and just start off with addressing the cost moaners..If you added up the cost of all the tracks and all the cars then yes.. its insane money...........BUT............... and here is the buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuttttttttttt... In other car racing games you end up liking 2, 3 maybe 4 cars more than any... the same goes for tracks... yeah you know your way around them all but there are a handful you just love and end up sticking to them. I never thought I would like oval racing.... After getting into it and learning a bit more about the race craft i am absoultely HOOOOKED!!! so why buy tracks and cars you dont really like.... simple... if you are a stat glory monkey.. and want to be the next best F1 racer then you will probably end up spending a lot to get there... Also if you buy a game from a popular franshise a few years after it was released, and want all the downloadable content and mods and addons that have been created since its release, it would cost a small fortune.... but most people play from the start and add it as they go alone a bit a time.. iRacing has been around for a while now and walking late into it there is a lot to catch up on also the amount of work that has gone into creating the tracks is mind boggling,, there is a youtube video of them scanning the tracks... the constant updates, support and improvements.. the devs actually listen and care what the community are asking. their net code its bang on... i have been racing against people from all over the world and zero issues with connections from anyone. There is also sooooo much to learn and do before you even need to think about purchasing extra content. There is enough in the starter pack to keep you entertained for a lonnnnng time. This is not a game.. this is a simulator.. i used to think Project Cars was the poodles plums... it still is in its own right.. Project Cars has one foot either side of the arcade -------- real life simulator line. But iRacing is so far away from the arcade side of the line you cant see the line anymore.. I have only been signed up for a week on iRacing and i can honestly say this Sim is mind blowing!!i can only manage 2 or 3 races an evening, the adrenaline, mental and physical strain after a 40 lap oval is crazy. my first race i was shaking after it so much i couldnt pick up a glass to drink.. :D if you love project cars / asset corsa but wish there was a way of policing the idiots that spoil it for everyone else by parking on the apex of a blnd bend, ramming into the back of you because they are bored. etc etc etc... iRacing has that.... yeah there are the occasional ends of a bell. but there are things in place to punish and reward bad and good driving. its as close as you are ever going to get to real racing while sat in your pants at home. if anyone thinks about giving it a go after reading this send me your email address, i can invite you and get some in game  $$ to put towards cars and tracks.EditUpdate.. after 2 weeks and 24 something hours play time this game just gets better and better. I thought i would end up in road class but i have fallen in love with oval racing. even though its baptism by fire and in rookie starting ranks it is total chaos. its all about making it to the end of the race rather than coming first. once out of rookies it starts getting serious not to mention even more fun....in my 30+ years of gaming there have only been a couple of games that have got my heart pumping and adrenaline flowing. iRacing does this every race more than anything else i have played. here is a video of my first race where i am in 1st place and fighting for it back for 20 solid laps..

If you buy at least one full priced game ($65) a month, iRacing will save you some money in your wallet.Please look into this title if you are looking into simulation games or are looking for a real racing/track experience.NOTE: Please look at iRacing like a hobby, not a game. Most use it because they can't afford to race cars in real life or have a disability that prevents it.			",180,71,32,40,18,5,39

												The best racing experience you will find anywhere. One thing to note, you get enough content when you purchase the subscription to race but you are limited. You must purchase additional cars and tracks to race in them. Additional cars cost a one-time fee of $11.95. Additional tracks cost a one-time fee of either $11.95 or $14.95 (depending on the track). If you buy 3 pieces of content (cars or tracks) at once you’ll receive a discount of 10%. If you buy 6 pieces of content at once you’ll receive a discount of 20%. If you own either every road OR oval car (plus any 25 tracks), every new car or track you buy gets discounted at 25%. If you own all the cars and tracks, every new car or track you buy gets discounted at 30%. This is a bit of a negative but it really does separate out the 10 year olds and the guys who really want to race. Not to mention the tracks and cars are laser scanned so you're getting the most accurate stuff out there. The rookie series is a bit of a mess but once you advance out of that the racing gets much cleaner.Updates come 4 times a year approx. every 13 weeks. Drivers that are reckless and intentionally wreck others can, and will, be banned. Anyone can be protested after a race and a 30 min cool-down. Plenty more but I'm trying to keep this short if your interested in a real racing experience look no further, this is the place for you.Feel free to add me and ask questions if you like.-Edit- Lots of AC fanboys I see. FYI I own AC and PCars this is better then both but downvote away. Let me know when someone finally gives a proper negative review.			",102,11,28,14,23,2,27

												iRacing.... This game is one of a kind! Is it a good driving/racing game? Hell yes! Best of its class. is it a bargain? Not so much.Besides a outdated slow website (Which is getting updated and you don't use much besides the initial join) This game is epic! in all ways. Graphics aren't top, But they aren't the worst either. With a simple texture update you can make it look much nicer! The handling is responsive, fluid and lovely all round, You can loose controll but you have controll too! A good balance. throttle and breaking is also very fluid, the car feels real. It's best with a wheel but it works well with a Gamepad too! . but I don't think you will win many races in a gamepad.If this game was cheaper, I could see a lot more people owning it, especially Racing fans. This game does cost a lot. but doesn't mean you got to buy everything! A decent selection of cars and tracks, very american orientated (But expected with a american company) In short:Sounds are superb,handling model is perfect,graphics are decent-could easily be improved,UI is pretty nice not the best,game gets regular updates, Game costs a fortune if you want everything. Loving this game all round with many little nice touches and some really good ideas to filter out bad drivers and good drivers. its very rewarding too!All round 85/100a Few smaller things could do with changing but they aren't game critical and is more down to personal preference.For the price , Try it for a month!

												IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SIM THAT HAS A AMAZING COMMUNITY LOOK NO FUTHER. yeah the pricing is steep and sometimes the physics are questionable. I have played the forza'z and GT's hell even AC. this is the only one i go back to playing. (Note:just recently steam linked my account, will hit my 3 year mark on it. Have B in Oval and A in Road.)			",115,13,21,29,28,1,14

												This game is thought for simulation racers (not Forza / GT / F1 201X etc.) due to the complexity of setups and racing rules!Note: I drove mostly road classes in iRacing. But I also did race in oval classes.Not recommended due to:• Physics: Overall good but some key elements are unrealistic (example: There are many cars you cant catch anymore if you get little sideways) - also many people & pros think that in some of the lower classes (Rookie & D) the devs have reduced the grip for some cars on purpose to make it more difficult for rookies, what is imo unnessecary and annoying (example: D class Ford spec racer)>>> Within Sim Racing known to be quite unrealistic and outdated (game engine is from 1997)!It has still some bugs from Grand Prix Legends (1998)! Ridiculous• Tires: Only 1 compound per car, unrealistic pressuresPro's say: All cars should always have between 180 - 190 kPa => thats so unrealistic, as temperature doesnt matter at allSeriously? for that price?• No rain simulation or day/night transition• To be fast you need to be racing pretty much every day: You cant just jump in and expect that you drive in the Top 20% of the race (even if you have already 100h in iRacing or 1000s of hours in other proper simulations (ie. rFactor 2) and you have talent)Even with fixed setup (fixed means everyone gets a preset setup and so is equal).That is also partially due to the problem with the force feedback and complicated setup system with unrealistic setup rules (ie. tire pressures).• General racing rules: [Again this review is mostly for the road racing part of iRacing]:- The flag system used in this game is the American one. This makes sense for oval but not for many road series / classes (ie. Blancpain Sprint series) - I would understand if some European stuff would be cut (ie. blue flags) but totally leave it out is nonsense.- Generally you can overtake under yellow flag, WTF!- Generally the track boundary rules are inconsistent and unrealistic!• Community: If you say something negative about iRacing people gonna flame you etc. Sry but one of the worst communities when it comes to state critic about the game. Typically fanboys - reminds me alot about when Apple was extremely popular - or about the political scene in my country when you say something against the left-wing politics and you instantly get brandmarked as a Nazi...• Force Feedback: In general not bad, you need to tweak it a bit in the beginning and you need to set the strenght force  every time again if you sit in another car (annoying as hell). The 2 biggest problem i have are:- That you cant tweak the forces properly (except with an extremely painful and long way which I wont go into)- By default you cant feel the fronts AT ALL - pros say you have to listen to the sound which imo is ridiculous for a proper (self called) motorsport simulation. Every sim does it way better- You also cant turn off rumble effects (ie. ABS rumble) or even tweak them to a lower value - no thats not possible and a real problem for some wheels (ie. G27)• Safety Rating: I saw A license people that would be banned in normal leagues - they simply farm their Safety Rating in Time Trial andor lower classes. You can also report people for their driving - the big problem there is that they only penalize if its clear that it was intentional - normal stupid crashes wont be penalized (both get some incident points, even the guy clearly not at fault as the game doesnt judge) and thats one of the big problems in this game.Also falling from (ie) A > B license is extremely difficult but its way too easy to get up from B > A license. All in all those are big flaws and mostly the reason why you even see in upper series and races (ie. 24h of Spa, B license Blancpain Sprint Spa) so many unnessecary & stupid & ridiculous crashes. One of the most important features is flawed and thats another reason why i wont drive any longer in iRacing, i have more fun in a controlled (Admin) environment (league / clan etc.) in Project CARS even it has little more bugs!• Price: To get to A license you have to invest at least 100$ - but racing in an A class series for the whole season will cost you around 200$ - 300$ (depending how many free tracks are in, but more likely its 300 bucks) - the prices for tracks (once each 15$) and cars (once each 12$) are ridiculously high, the same you get in Raceroom / Project CARS / Assetto Corsa for 5$ (Tracks) resp. 2 - 4$ (cars). Okay is the monthly fee of 12$ / Month (or 179$ / 2 years) - I understand they have to cover server costs and for multiplayer race organisation its a fair price. There are coupons though which help a bit.• Updates: Above complaints (most of them) are agreed on by the iRacing community since years but why havent they been fixed or (properly) improved is the key question? They must easily make enough money to have a dev team still working on it. My thought: Its all about money instead of quality - ironically I believe more people would race (and existing people would invest more time) in iRacing if even 50% of the complaints from above would be fixed and profits would probably be more.Not positive nor negative• Netcode: Good, server run most time very stable- Sometimes laggy cars (they jump around alot and imo they should be ghosted or removed as theyre a big problem - this is a client side problem, their internet connection)- Netcode collisions: Even on your screen & both replays you didnt hit him, sometimes up to 20cm difference and thats crazy especially because close racing is a key element of motorsports- Sometimes people also warp inside each other at medium & bigger collisions what causes in the end way too much damage and breaks immersion and fun• HUD: Not modern but working as intended and intuitivePositive things:• Car / Suit / Helmet Paints - everything customizable. With an external program Tradingpaints you can use even completely selfpainted liveries.• Only people with wheels can drive in iRacing, thats great, as gamepad & keyboard drivers are known to cause more collisions and to be slower• Graphics: Nice - has good framerates• Dynamic tracks (localized track-temperatures): Cool feature• Tracks: Good variety, very accurate, some of the best you can find in sim racing• Car variety (not physics or similiar): Good spectrum of cars available• Damage: Has imo the best damage model of all simulations, even sometimes (suspension bouncing) buggy & inconsistent over cars (Tank Mercedes AMG GT3 vs. Balloon Audi R8 LMS GT3)• Driver Swap : I love it - only Live for Speed has that too• Awesome organisation of races & race series & special events: Thats the primary reason why iRacing makes a lot of fun>>> but the problems with Safety Rating (ability to drive clean of other drivers) reduce that to having only sometimes fun, most of the time when you wanna really race (and that i mean proper on track position fights) it ends in tears because most drivers dont know the rules or just dont really care and ram you!Conclusion: I cant recommend this gameThis multiplayer concept is great but has some flaws which reduce overall fun a lot, especially when you try to race other people. If this would cost less i would still recommend it but the prices are ridiculously high (I cant remember any game that cost that much aswell) and you can have for less money equal or much more fun (other racing simulations with leagues). There are also other problems that need to be fixed before i call it a good racing simulation. And some people in the community are way too toxic.>>> I recommend rather buy Project CARS / Assetto Corsa / rFactor 2 and join a good league with events & rules ... you will have more fun than in iRacing			",39,2,15,3,16,0,10

												As a die-hard sim racer and occasional real world racer I find iRacing to be the closest sim to real world racing. The multiplayer aspect of iRacing is unrivalled, the licence system and the way you work your way to the top feels as if you are a real race driver. The trick with iRacing is that it actually gives you relevant skills to race in the real world and can also build you a reputation that can greatly help with real world opportunities. I cannot rate iRacing enough, it is absolutely fantastic. Although it has ruined every other game for me now, all I play is iRacing!			",32,5,32,3,12,0,3

												DONT EVEN CALL IT A GAME! Because it's not, This is a Tool for training how to drive REAL race cars at fast speeds! Profesional drivers use iRacing, to LEARN a race track that they may have never been to in real life yet, weeks in advance of traveling there in real life! Dale Earnhardt Jr. is one of those professional Drivers who has Attested to having done exactly that! iRacing is so accurate to real life, that the same Cracks, Bumps and Grooves that are in the pavement that you can see on T.V.  and see in the famous Indianapolis Raceway, Are there in iRacing IN EXACT DETAIL down to the MILIMETER! They use Laser Scanning to make an IDENTICAL COPY of the real track! So tracks that maybe have small Banking on a 90 degree turn in real life, you might race that same track in Forza or Asseto Corsa, and be forced to take that turn WAY SLOWER than in real life thus negatively affecting your lap times, and you cannot compare your lap times in whatever car you just drove on that track to the professionals who drive that track in that identical car in real life!  Whereas with iRacing you can take a lap time at say Daytona Speedway in an Actual GEN-6 NASCAR RaceCar or Indy Car, and then Compare it to ANY Real Nascar or INDY driver's REAL Qualifying TIME on that track in that same car in real life to see how you stack up! NO OTHER RACING GAME HERE ON STEAM CAN MAKE THAT CLAIM and truely back it up, time after time...on track after track!        So i say again, Dont go thinking this is a ""GAME"" because this.... if anything, is a way for you to develop real life skills that you could take into a real life race car and start a racing career with. (if you dont believe it, look up iRacings World champions, Many of them have done exactly that, and used iRacing as a launchng point for their real life racing career's! So basically, if you like Arcade style racing games but dont like watching competitive MotorSports in real life, Wishing you could be the guy or girl driving that car at 200 plus miles an hour,.....Then iRacing may not be for you. And the reason i say this is, in iRacing there is no Rewinding time if you hit a wall or something, theres no buying PARTS UPGRADES, theres no cheat codes or ""TURBO BOOST BUTTON"", And if you dont have a steering wheel and aren't prepared to race the way a REAL driver would race, then you will seriously be having a hard time with it when you rise out of your Rookie License's in both Road and Oval Racing! (Although every once in a while people on X-Box controlers can do QUITE decently, BUT, it takes A LOT LONGER to get good at mastering an X-box's Joystick to get through a particular turn's ""Apex"" without missing a beat, And to be comepletely honest here....Most of the people i've talked to who started out on X-Box Controllers like that, IMMEDIATELY went and bought a steering wheel and pedals!Which despite being a bit of an Investment, you need to remember you're investing in Real Life skills you can use Every day to drive safer, OR Even take these skills into a real Race car in real life! So is that worth a few hundred dollars?...You BET IT IS!)          One thing i learned EARLY ON in my still very young iRacing Career, which was something SO OBVIOUS, i completely ""FACEPALMED"" myself once i truely REALIZED that i was so Naive' to believe it!....And this was how i've been SubConciously TRAINED over the years without realizing it, that all these Movies and ""arcade style"" racing games make you think that you can just FLOOR the gas pedal through a wreck, and things like touching a wall with the front fender does no damage to the car, or, driving alongside another car and you bump his Left Rear Fender, and nothing happens whereas in real life the wreck that you would cause Could be catastrophic to ALL cars involved!, And in those games and movies you catch the competition pretty fast if you fall behind because they have ""catch up speed"" toggle-able! Or if theres a wreck up ahead you can just Floor the gas pedal and push the other cars out of your way!....      And in iracing NONE OF THAT IS TRUE! This is REAL DEAL, REAL LIFE RACING AGAINST REAL DRIVERS (Some of whom Race on weekends at their Local Track in Real life, and have Years of Training over your skills!) And you must Drive as competitively as you can WITHOUT  making contact with other cars & walls as best you can! Touch a wall and spin out and cause  damage to your car? If that happens you can't just expect to pull a manuever like when playing  ""NEED FOR SPEED"" and pull back out, onto the track and race right back up to first place!     Your damage has REAL AFFECTS on your engine performance, Wheel alignment, and Aerodynamics! If all of that car isn't in pristine condition, you are SEVERELY HINDERING yourself! And in most cases a pit-in or Towing all the way back into the pits is necessary, and just be prepared that in ""ROOKIES"" you will see it happen multiple times per race where someone will spin, cause a wreck with another car, and then get back and keep going, not realizing that the now damaged car they are driving is slower and now a danger to others as they try to pass that damaged car at high speed!             Now as for Pricing: There are those who complain about the price, but the prices they charge AREN'T to line their pockets with money like these $60 dollar a game, Arcade Style Racing games! When iracing Charges you THE MINIMUM PRICE THAT THEY CAN, Give you A BUNCH OF FREE CONTENT WITH YOUR FIRST PURCHASE of the service, And EVEN Allow your Races to contribute to your ""Store Credit""!! They do all of that, Just so after you pay about $40. Dollars to get started with iRacing, you have pretty much all the tracks and Cars you need to compete for a few months without having to pay anything else! But when iRacing charges me. $11.95 for a car that i want to race that season $14.95 for a track, i HAPPILY pay that because iRacing is setup to charge each driver the MINIMUM it can in order for our purchases of those cars and tracks to fund the development of FUTURE TRACKS AND CARS!    So imagine Like me you live on a Disability income and since like me you live near Laguna Seca (Or whatever Real life track near you, that you wished you could've Competed at!), you've wished your whole life you could get into Racing Profesionally, But Like me, Despite your parents WANTING to get you into the sport, couldn't afford it for you when you were young...    Now picture for Roughly $40 bucks and the Price of a Decent Steering wheel and pedal setup, i can take a Porsche out on that track and finally LIVE THAT DREAM! And finally, for MUCH CHEAPER than it costs to drive a REAL RaceCar, i can Learn, and study from Professional Drivers! I can even Race AGAINST REAL PRO's IF  I KEEP practicing and get good enough! About a year ago a 17yr old Kid who won the Iracing Championship NASCAR series is now Announced plans to get into racing in Real life! And he's only been Racing in iRacing for 5 or 6 years! And it shows that this isnt some ""GAME"" to go play to unwind, This is a severely competitive Adrenaline rush inducing Simulation of the REAL THING!    In Closing, the rule of thumb you can apply to both real life racing and iRacing is that much like Real life Racing the Competitive level is REAL! NO OTHER RACING GAME OR ANY VIDEO GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED, has EVER truely given me ""BUTTERFLIES"" just from the level of sheer excitement you get in a rolling start before that green flag drops!  Especially since you are being given the  opportunity to drive against people who are just as fast, or if not faster than you are!     No other Racing Game or Even Regular Computer Game has EVER been able to TRUELY provide that ""BUTTERFLIES IN THE STOMACH"" Feeling to drivers and gamers alike! Not in the way that iRacing does! And i can attest to it, having nearly 200 steam Games, that Despite it being a bold statement it is 100% TRUE!			",134,11,6,9,20,0,12

												I can recommend this game only to the most hardcore virtual racing fan. Buy it if you want to experience an virtual racing career in a professional community, but be aware that you have to put up with a lot.PRO* great community* Fantastic implementation of a virtual racing career - every race matters, and you really get your adrenalin going.* Good physicsCONTRA* Extremely expensive. Like monthly subscription PLUS multiple hundred dollar of DLC expensive. And you need the DLC, otherwise you don't have many races available to progress your career.* Steam integration is a joke - it does not even display the correct playing time.* Outdated graphics* You have to use their website to launch races. The website is outdated & buggy* No support. Due to a bug in their website my name was not displayed correctly, because it contains international characters. I wrote four emails to their support email address, did not receive any useful response and they did not fix the problem during the month I subscribed to the service. I have to wonder if you get the same kind of support if you experience an issue that actually prevents you from using their paid service. ",63,24,13,12,19,0,11

												Member since 2009. Hour count doesn't reflect how much time and energy I've spent on the service.Is it expensive (compared to other sims)? Yes.Does it lack some features that other sims have, and are things that hardcore fans demand? Yes.Can it be frustrating? Yes.Then why do I keep on playing it, more than its competitors?Because of the biggest competitive scene of simracers in the world, paired with the best matchmaking system in the world. Practically no league you have participated comes close to this, and the big offer of official races is too good to resist, specially if your work and family always get in the way with a fixed timespot on the week to commit on racing. It's a premium, but it's absolutely worth it.			",51,0,6,2,3,0,1

												Like most of people, I was playing Forza or Gran Turismo and I was thinking at that time, this is a ""real racing simulation"". I was wrong.Iracing is not a game, this is a simulation of racing and of a driver career. You won't have thousands of japanese cars to drive, may be you will have only 10 cars. But you will learn each car and how to correctly drive them. You will have to learn each inch of corners, bumps etc.And yes this game is expensive if you want to play new series, but compared to the time you will spent on it and the pleasure you will get, its worth it.If you are not sure if this game is for you, just take a 3 months fee, with the free content. Warning: you may be addicted to it.			",81,14,20,6,6,1,2

												Being the NASCAR fan that I am, this racing simulator is honestly the best way to go. It's got every NASCAR series, every NASCAR track, and has the most realistic physics of any NASCAR simulator. Although the crash physics are terrible and could be improved very much so, I think this is a great way to go if you are a die hard NASCAR fan! Now this game isn't just all NASCAR, it's got many other things on the road side. iRacing has pleased me very much, and I reccomend it to anyone who loves racing and simulators!			",2,0,6,0,1,0,0

												I got this game in Oct 2014 after getting tired of the constant wreck fests in Aesseto Corsa's online racing. Whilst the graphics are slighty dated in comparison to games such as AC they are still 'very' good on max settings. The only thing you really need to ask yourself when deciding whether to buy this game is.....""is your main enjoyment Online Racing?"" If the answer is 'yes' then there there is no other game that comes even remotely close to what iracing offers for online competitive racing. When you first start out and race in the rookie series it can seem no better than other online racing games ..a total crash fest, but once you raise your irating so that you're no longer in the lower splits, it becomes real racing. The 'Safety Rating', 'Irating' and Points you earn in whatever season chamionship you've entered, all make each race 'mean' something. All stats of your races are saved so that you can review your entire career and see how you 've improved. Save replays of any race or practice session and watch it from the perspective of any other driver.If enjoy online racing ...get iracing!! ....end of story! i cannot recommend this game enough for its online competitive racing!Couple of extra things to note: - - Check the actual website before buying it through steam, as there may be discounts on the site that are not on steam. - Although it may initially seem expensive buying cars and tracks there is a discount for bulk purchases, and a couple of times a year there are discounts on subsciption / iracing dollars, which brings the price down quite a bit.

												I'm a PC gamer since 1994, and right from the beginning I played many racing games - Microprose F1GP, Indycar Racing, Nascar titles, Need For Speed , and so on. Some years ago I tried Live For Speed and was hooked on it for several months, I can say that this was my first true simulation experience. In that time I played some NetKar, rFactor, F1 and SimBin games too.From then, my wheel and pedals had been quietly standing in a box. Until I tried out Assetto Corsa recently, which got me instantly hooked.I progressed in the career, did some hotlapping, the sim is amazing. Then I tried the multiplayer... and well, I was disappointed. In some races I was leading, and near the end some wrecker would take me down smiling. Trying to kick this guys from the server, no one votes, no one cares. No sanctioning whatsoever.I saw iRacing with a 3 months free promo, and just WOW... this is a completely different story. From the start, from the behaviour of the car you can notice that it is a simulation, and not something made to entertain. And when you figure out the way the races are structured, the licences, the leagues, you forget everything else.To progress in the sim you have to BE SAFE, you don't have to be fast. This is a requirement, and surely helps teaching new players how to behave in the track. You start out in the rookie class, and you'll wanna get out of it as soon as possible, since this class acts as a ""filter"", all the wreckers-who-wanna-win-in-the-first-corner are there. As soon as you progress to D class, the quality of the drivers is noticeable better. You can easily achieve this in 1 or 2 days.Clean racing, fairplay. This is what separates iRacing from the rest.The netcode is by far the best I ever tried. All the servers belong to iRacing, so this also helps to deliver the best experience, almost without lags and dissapearing cars.In relation to pricing, I probably end up saving money. Instead of buying that random Steam game that eventually I wouldnt even play, the only thing I spend now is on iRacing.But in the end, they deserve every penny, because you get quality from the service. In any case, you don't have to buy anything in the beginning. You can progress as you'll like, and stay with the included cars and tracks only. You'll have plenty of time to decide on which career path you wanna follow (open wheel/close wheel, oval/road racing, etc).This is a simulator that demands true effort, but it pays back with the best racing moments you'll ever get from a computer.Warning: Expect to be completely addicted and spending MUCH more time that you've predicted, on this game. You've been warned! :)			",53,7,9,5,6,0,4

												iRacing may not have the prettiest graphics, or the most realistic physics (although it is very much on par with other top sims like rFactor 2 and Asetto Corsa...what is best comes down to personal preference).  The attention to detail on the tracks and cars as well as the obvious love for racing the dev team has and the obsurd competition is has to offer wayy more than make up for this.  It is far and away the best sim for muliplayer racing.  I've been a member for over three years and have purchased almost all of the content (although much of it I've never actually needed, you can race reltively cheap if you a smart) and I don't regret a single cent I've spent.  I highly recomend this to anyone looking for a competitive multiplayer racing experience!			",61,6,15,8,19,2,6

												Best racing sim on PC and the only racing sim on PC capable of giving a good multiplayer experience. iRacing is to racing sims what Counterstrike is to FPS games. Don't buy the game from steam though buy it directly from iracing and get a steam key from them when you finish. It's much cheaper to buy the game from them.Pros- Multiplayer experience is perfect, match making, license progression, incident points etc it all works great and you can get a race at any time of day. - Cars and tracks are very well scanned and recreated- Realism is second to none best physics on the PC and most complete featureset- Continual improvement and evolution with new patches every 3 months often adding major featuresCons- Not enough time in the day to play it- Steam implementation is poor - Will make every other game seem underwhelming in comparison			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been playing this game for over 2 years and it just continues to get better with every update.Pros:-Incredibly active and helpful community.-Laser scanned tracks.-Very good tire model.-Accountability system for wrecking.-Skill system that puts you in a split with similarly skilled drivers.-Leagues, teams, human spotters.-Custom paint support.Cons:-Slightly outdated graphics, but I think it still looks quite good.-Can be costly.-Not very controller-friendly, but if you're willing to take the time to practice it is definitely possible. But I hightly recommend a wheel.Overall I don't think there is another racing sim out there that is as competetive and clean online. Sure, there are a few other sims with better physics and graphics, but you will not find this kind of online experience anywhere else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been on the service for 2 years now. I found it after searching for the most realistic driving sim and I can't be more satisfied! The races are amazing and challenging. You can do short or long races, whatever suits you best.All the tracks are laser scanned, which means maximum authenticity when it comes to how accurate the tracks really are, compared to the real ones.iRacing isn't about achievments or unlocking things as you go, but rather the thrill of racing itself.When provided with such good racing quality, you just don't need any other gimmicks.The graphics aren't the best in the industry, but it's good enough and has a lot of detail.They plan to upgrade the engine to DX11 soon anyway so it will only get better!See ya on the grid!

												It may not have the end all be all best physics on the market (Unless you're talking Oval but then the competition is only vs Eutrenexy, makers of such ""great"" games as Ride to Hell, or vs the decade old NASCAR 2003 Season, made by many of the same devs as iRacing) or the best graphics on the market. But there's one thing iRacing does have. The best RACING. Highly competitive, comparitivly clean, the only real choice for public racing is iRacing. If you're tired of every pubby race in Assetto Corsa or the like ending in Turn 1 with everyone calling for a restart vote, iRacing is the thing to try.If you're looking for a sim to do solo hotlaps in, this is perhaps not the best choice however. There also is no AI, so you only can race against real people.Current Promo Code as of March: PR-NEWEMAIL22615 3 Months for $12No idea how long it will be valid for, the previous two codes are now invalid.You can only use one of the above, and only on new accounts through their website not steam (you can link to steam afterwards of course), so choose wisely.///Year Long Member with over 300 races who just linked to Steam.\\\			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are looking to race real people, this is hands down the best sim to do so. Over all it feels pretty great and major updates are really taking things to the next level (dynamic tracks, rubber marbles, debris from off track and soon dirt). But most important is the online competition. You get some pretty great races here (once you get out of R at least). Makes it pretty worth it. But yes, the cost is a bit high, it really becomes a hobby at that point, a kind of, how much do you want to race? thing going on. I'm sure there are online communities for other sims, but iRacing has a really eazy to use race system and you can almost always have people to run with. For me its worth it, pretty much, but again it comes down to this not just being another game, its a whole hobby in and of itself.			",281,47,30,20,23,2,40

												Great sim.Just player base isn't the best. MAny empty sessions. I was OK with the cost I guess for a while. But since January they now charge tax on top of already expensive subscriptions. Discounts have been reduced,, to a point where they only cover the tax cost that wasn't there before 2017.For me , its to much for the amount of time I put into it. Hence I cannot recommend as all that content you buy needs a sub to play.So that 400 bucks spent overall isn't a nice pill to swLlow.Be interesting to see Plyer base in a year . as they don't do much to promote the game as i t is,Works great with wheel and rift.Still for online e racing its no.1.Shame they can't grow and just shrink as a company ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Is it expensive yes? But it's all the money worth if you are looking for the ultimate Multiplayer racing experience. Players off all skill levels are racing against equally skilled racers thanks to the iRating system. Remember that the subscription only gives you the base content. All cars are priced at 15$ and tracks at either 10 or 15$ Everything is laserscanned and done down to the finest detail so it's the most accurate sim you can get hold of.

												It's extremely expensive but if you look for competitive racing on daily basis it's the only option you have. The content is of high quality but comes at additional cost. The base-content that comes with the subscription doesn't represent the game well. The overall realism, in particular the tiremodel, is still questionable after years of development. But it's slowly improving! If you're serious about sim-racing and you don't mind spending hundreds of dollars to get started, then I can recommend iRacing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												iRacing is the best racing simulator out there, no doubt about it for me. Lets get the negatives out of the way. Yes, it is expensive.Yes, people will crash you.That is the negatives I can come up with. What is then the best thing about iRacing? I’m a fairly fit guy, I work out a lot and ride mountain bikes in my spare time. I once, for fun, had my pulse watch monitoring my heart rate during a race and it peaked at 137 bpm! That is a lot, it is actually insanely high. For comparison, I was riding my mountain bike out in the woods for a couple of hours with an average heart rate of 169 bpm. If you find ANY game that beats this level of excitement and adrenaline please tell me, I NEED to try it!Now about the sim itself. The racing is close, I run the Blancpain Sprint Series which is a GT3 racing series. You might have heard that name before. That is because it is an officially licensed racing series that, also runs in the real world. That series adds to the list of Indycars and NASCAR and perhaps more, those are the two I can remember off the top of my head. That is cool. So the actual racing comes as close to real life as you can get in front of a computer (for now). Some critics of the game say the physics aren’t right, and a couple of years back it was nicknamed “IceRacing”.  I never agreed. I would like to know what qualifies those critics to actually comment on that. I bet only very few people have actually driven the real life counterparts to the cars in iRacing. iRacing updates every 12th week, some large and some small updates, to keep their physics top notch. Which is one of the reasons it is so expensive. Another is the officially licensed tracks and cars. As I said people will crash you, but it is often avoidable if you’re smart. I avoid many accidents and have a good safety rating. So if you instead of think “That f**king♥♥♥♥♥♥ what an idiot” try to focus on what you could’ve done better to avoid a crash you will see your safety rating improve and you won’t crash as much. I’ve never seen anyone intentionally wreck anyone – but I have seen some stupid passing attempts go horribly, horribly wrong.That is what I have to say about iRacing. It is a fantastic game! Get it!I only wish it was less time consuming!			",64,2,19,5,8,1,10

												I've been iRacing since 3-3-14. I absolutely love it.Too expensive, you say? I spend 4$ a year to play iRacing. At this point, I have all the tracks/cars that I need, so my expenses for the future will be my 4$ yearly subscription. If you race 8 races a season in the any of the B/A class races, and 8 in the D/C series, you receive 10$ participation credits a season(4 times a year so $40).With the yearly 5$ anniversary credits and the 49$ yearly subscription sales they have, I get away from it cheaply.On to the racing, thats why Im here. I don't have all the time in the world to play because of life, but the time I do get to spend, I don't waste because of the quality of racing in this simulation. The races are set to a certain time schedule so that theres a race almost always about to start. You jump right into a field of racers that are similiar to your skill level. I recently joined a league, which has only increased the experience. The irating and the safety rating systems they have in place make it so people are required to race a certain way, or be punished by the intense drops in safety rating. Which then drops the license class and you wont be able to race the stuff you want to race.I joined iRacing because of road racing. I wasn't an oval fan before iRacing, but now I'm completely in love. I used to think there was nothing to oval racing, and even described NASCAR as an ""adult male soap opera. Left turn, left turn.""  The actual difficulty of pack racing around a superspeedway cleanly, the difference that .5 degrees of negative Caster on your front left tire has on your tire wear over a 15 lap run at Dover, the effect a 0x tail whip into the wall actually makes on your lap times,(I literally could just continue to go)  and the overall utter enjoyment of what Im doing has made me appreciate oval racing a bit more. Any type of racing you want to do, its here.A wheel is a must, in my opinion. I started with a g27, have since upgraded to a t500rs with shifter. This sim has made me make the change to triple monitors, which I suggest to every video gamer because it has improved the experience almost all of the games I play.If your not sure you should try this, look around for a promo code. Theres typically a promo code for 3 months for $5, or cheaper. But take it from me, if you don't want to give up every video game you've purchased on Steam because of a racing service you found online, then don't even bother trying iRacing, because it'll hook you!!

												I have been a member for about 6 months but have played other driving Sims. However in this game you will find some of the best, and most clean racing. The only downside is that you can not judge this game until you are OUT of rookies. Being a rookie is annoying and hard but once you mack the jump to the next class a world of good racing is opened. From that point it only gets better. With racing ranging from a good care free times with friends in races with no consequences all the way to the most competitive SIM racing expirence you'll ever find this game has it all. I ask you to a least play for one month. Its worth every penny.			",95,7,13,5,16,0,3

												Easily the best multiplayer sim racing experience. It may not have the best sounds, physics, or graphics, but the quality of racing whenever you want it is amazing. iRacing makes it easy to race, fits around anyone's schedule, and as long as you put in the practice it is very enjoyable.You cannot just jump in with a controller and expect to have fun. Heavy investment is required to have the full experience in the form of a racing wheel and pedal set with force feedback. Although you have to pay additionally for cars and tracks in addition to the subscription, it ensures high quality racing with others who are just as committed to the sim.If this is your first sim, don't buy it yet. First I would recommend that you try rFactor/Game Stock Car/Assetto Corsa and join a league of your choice, practice and get better to ensure that you will enjoy sim racing, but only if you hunger for more would I recommend this game.

												This game is olny for those who really enjoy racing competively against racers from around the world. I'm going to base this review off of oval racing since that is what I've spent most of my hours on. Overview:iRacing is split into two types of racing, oval and road. Oval is basically NASCAR, Late Model, etc. Road is basically GT's, Formula One, etc. You don't have to do both to progess which I am grateful cause I suck at road course racing. If your into oval racing, you can just do oval racing, which is what I obviously do. Physics:Absolutly some of the best physics I've experienced in a racing game. Each car has it's own style and you have to adapt to each one you drive. For example, the Camping World Trucks handle completely different than the Whelen Modifieds in terms of handling and speed. This makes you go in practice and actually learn how each car drives which is amazing! Progression:In iRacing, you work through what is called Safety Rating. As you increase your Safety Rating, more series(cars and tracks) are available to drive(Sadly you have to buy everything which is major downside). The only way to increase your SR is to race cleanly and smart. Sometimes though you get put in stupid situations that you can't get out of, but that's apart of racing anyway.Competitiveness: A lot of races I've joined have been really competitive. So competitive that my heart races when I have the chance to win a race. There's never been a moment where I thought that a race was to easy because anything could happen. Overall I recommend this game to only those who really enjoy to race and being competitive. This isn't a cheap game either so you have to be willing to spend the money. But if you really enjoy racing, any purchases you make will payoff in the long run.  ",37,1,6,2,8,0,0

There is also a lot USA cars / tracks in this, what is good in general, but you will notice this US style also for road races. Kinda cups / cars etc. However you could drive GT3 / Formula Renault / Formula 1. And there are a lot of official tracks in this. Remind this:you gotta pay to drive (by year for example)you gotta buy cars and tracks. These are unlocked forever, but you cannot login into your account after subscription has end, till you renew it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Iracing's been around since 2008 and is constantly evolving and growing. People will argue back and forth about the merits of the physics in Assetto Corsa, RFactor and iRacing. If you just want to jump in and have a casual race against AI but don't like arcade physics then AC or RFactor are probably your best bet, but, if you love racing real people in a structured environment then I'd encourage you to try the more involved mmo experience that is the iRacing service.As well as official races in different series hourly, there are special events that are put on by the service. I just took part in a 24 hour race with driver swaps and teammates from all over the world. Amazing experience.You will have an irating that will aim to group you with other drivers of your ability and a safety rating that helps to ensure that safe and clean driving is promoted. For me that is the biggest plus of iRacing; driving against others who understand racing and respect you.			",19,10,2,7,3,0,6

												I have been playing this game before it was ever released on Steam.  In my opinon, it is one of the best racing sims out there today.  There are no AI so you know that you are always going to be racing against real people.  The community is great and very respectful. The competition from the other drivers is strong and great. Now lets get to the pros and cons.Pros:- Realistic- Competitive and Tough- Enjoyable- Many tracks and cars to use- Great systemCons:- There are bad drivers- Have to pay for cars and tracks as well as the subscription- Some minor bugs and fixes that could be fixed- Currency to buy items is only shown in USDIf you do plan on getting this sim, I suggest first getting a racing wheel and pedals for the most enjoyable and realistic experience.  If you do not own that, I suggest you get a gamepad.  I started out on the gamepad and did fine but did the best with a wheel. I reccommend you try this game. Definitely a must buy or anyone interested in racing.			",30,2,6,1,9,1,0

												You are bored with your NFS titles? Did you get a wheel and are looking for a proper simulation to get into sim racing? Then by all means DON'T BUY THIS GAME. Start with something cheaper like Assetto Corsa and see if proper sim racing is something you'll enjoy. Once you get good in it you'll be looking to compete against other people, and that's when iRacing becomes your only option.However! I feel like the devs should've made it much more clear as to how much money you actually need to spend on this. Just a subscription won't even get you a tenth of the content, though you can find enough enjoyment out of the stuff you get with it, especially if you're new.Other than the pricing which can make Call of Duty games with all their DLC look affordable - this game has no downsides. If you have the money there's no reason not to go for it.			",80,15,17,6,7,1,5

												Disclosure, ive never really tried online racing until iRacing. I got a 3 month free trial so decided to give it a go, the graphics turned me off initially. But If you at all enjoy racing you have to get this. There is simply nothing out there to compare with the racing platform this is. I competed in online Bathurst this year and finished 3rd, top 10 in Le Mans 24hr, the experience is something i will remember for a long time to come. Yes you will have to outlay a bit initially. Yes you will have to practice...a lot, yes you will have to learn to setup a car and have patience. It is expensive, you'll have to get a decent wheel and pedal set to get the most out of it. To buy all of the tracks and cars there is a few $100 in it. But there is simply nothing else out there at the moment with the structure, format and rules in place to make racing so enjoyable. For those who even have a drop of racer in thier blood, this is for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Updated 4/14/2017:Hands down the best Simulation you can get your hands on. Hold on. Don't leave. If you disagree I'd like for you to know why I think that. The best way to think of this sim is that they are a DCS/FSX like-sim group that host their own servers. So yes, the content does cost quite a bit separately, and the do charge you monthly. This allows them to continue making updates across the systems over time. Mind that they do a lot of their own research, shredding tires, etc. Having seen the developers work on past games, I can understand why they're doing it this way. And they're pretty upfront and honest about everything they're working on (despite some channels trying to accuse them of otherwise.). It's a solid simulator if you want the very best you can get.---------------Does that mean I recommend it to everyone?No. I don't.  Again, the way to think about iRacing is that it is the DCS of the Sim Racing world. It is a hardcore simulator (with a variety of flaws). Yes, the physics will be quirky because of how detailed they try to be. It's not always going to work ""perfectly"", however I believe other games tend to limit their physics calculations too much, causing the cars to be ""floaty"" (which isn't to be mistaken with the ""feel floaty"" aspects people have with iRacing).Dirt Racing is 100% awesome.If you want a game.... this isn't for you. If you just want to run some laps, this isn't for you.If you want something that is the best simulation of racing you can get... well.. if you can swallow the costs... do it.It's perfect. They have their methodology and it works. I can't fault them for that.			",141,12,13,15,8,1,5

												If you have a ffb wheel or going to buy one, this is the game. Absolutely great simulator with amazing multiplayer, I can't recommend it enough for the quality of the racing. They keep adding a lot of content and care about the game and their customers.However getting more tracks and cars is very expensive, the subscription is relatively expensive and the webpage that you do everything from feels like it's from 1998. It doesn't have a lot of downtime and it isn't really that slow, but when you're a millennial child and used to good frontends it is kind of annoying at times.			",63,9,2,6,2,0,2

												If you are a serious racer who wants fair, realistic & competitive racing against other like-minded racers, iRacing is the one and only place to be.Ive been on iRacing for 3.5 years now, just decided to connect the account to steam, so ignore the time played. ProsCommunityThe community is one of the bright spots of this service. Everyone has to use thier real names, giving a sense of accountability for each person.Driving/PhysicsThe physics teach you how to properly drive a race car. Asseto Corsa and Project Cars offer a simulation-esque physics engine but allow you to get away with certain maneuvers which would never work in the real world or iRacing. iRacing forces you to learn to do things right. The number of real life opportunities that have been opened up because of iRacing is a testement to how it prepares us as race car drivers. See MX5 challenge, NASCAR Peack Challenge, Greggor Huttu getting to test a star mazda car, michael conti getting to test a NASCAR car after winning the world championship. The list goes on...Racing/CompetitionThis is the #1 thing that sets iRacing apart from all other sims on the market. The racing & competition is unmatched. If you want close, clean, hard racing, you will get it here at any level. From Rookie MX5 to F1 or street stocks to Gen6 NASCAR. The racing is amazing at all levels as long as you have worked your way out of the bottom splits & shown you are a competent driver.Setting yourself personal goals and working towards them is really the purpose of iRacing. Theres always someone better then you which gives you motivation to work harder.Special EventsThe special events with thousands of drivers all competing at the same time across 20 or 30 splits is unique in the online sim racing world. Getting to race a proper 24 hour Team event was one of the best experiences Ive ever had sim racing and i'm a primary oval racer. Having the presssue of taking over the car from your teammate and trying not to wreck out is something so incredible.ConsWebsiteThe current website is clunky and not intutive for new users. Take the time to poke around and see where everything is and how everything works. The good news is that the website in its current form is in its last days. iRacing staff is well aware that its old and need of refresh and is actively rebuilding it from the ground up. This new Website is due out sometime this year along with a refreshed Sim UI. So things should be better in the near future.CostYes, the costs CAN be high. They dont need to be though. If you plan your purchases and take advantage of the twice a year 50% off deals, you can make it very affordable. I decided to think of iRacing as a hobby rather than a video game. When looked at from this perspective, its a very very affordable hobby compared to real racing or golf for example. Ive spent far more on my golf hobby than I have on iRacing in the last 3 years. So its money well spent knowing iRacing as a business is in it for the long haul and they plan on being around for many years to come.If your on a tight budget, plenty of fun can be had from the base subscription content & rookie series. You can stay racing in those series forever if you wish to not spend a dime on any DLC content.Graphics/AtmosphereThis is one area that iRacing could use some improvements. They just released a beta build of their DX11 engine which sets the foundation for newer, better graphics. The tracks are 100% laser scanned accurate but most seem very bare outside of the walls. Luckily you dont notice it much when your in the heat of the battle so its not a big deal. It will be nice to see some more life added outside of the ropes in the future.If you have the computer power to max the graphics right now, it looks pretty stunning but if your forced to turn things down, the graphics fidelity falls off pretty significantly giving it a pretty dated look.Day/Night transitions are missing but are one of the top priorities now that DX11 has been implemented. Fingers crossed that we see it before 2017 to make the 24.SummaryHighly recommended if you are a race fan or serious about true sim racing.			",0,0,3,0,2,0,0

												Although I have just 2 hours on the game I have had the game for a month and a half and done 44 Offical races I did not redeem my steam key for some time but I can say this is the best online racing simulators I have played to date.At the time of reviewing the games that pop out the most to me are Project cars, Assetto Corsa, Race Room Racing Experience and lots more... but none compare to iRacing.Things I love about iRacing PROS:-The sense of career in iRacing is incredible. Let me explain what I mean as I realise it's hard to understand if you have never played. iRacing should not be taken as a game but a career it's something you have to take seriously but it still has a great amount of fun.-The force feedback and physics of the cars is perfect, Assetto Corsa for me felt perfect I thought it could not get better but iRacing's feel is insane.-Laser scanned tracks and cars. You know in iRacing you are getting the best and most accurate version of cars, tracks compared to their real life counterpart.-The progression and license system is awesome. In iRacing, you race against drivers with the similar skill level to yourself meaning races are very competitive.CONS-Price. iRacing is a tough bullet to bite because of the prices involved but the monthly subscription isn't that bad but cars are $11.95 and tracks are $14.95 which means a full 12 week season can be roughly $160 which is pricey.-Hardware. You don't need the best PC in the world as iRacing is a really optimized game. But a wheel and pedal set which is absolutely necessary and keyboard or controller is not an option this will hold you back at least $400 but is a blast!I can only nitpick iRacing as it really is amazing and I can't ask for much more.SUGESSTIONS -Day and night cycle. I still refuse to do a 6+ Hour race because of no day and night cycle and its a shame would be amazing.-More weather RAIN!!!! Rain would be amazing but would take a lot of time for the developers as they loooveee to make things precise as possible.-Upgraded textures. The game is old I get it but the textures are really bad and this may be because of how the laser scanning works but if not new textures would be an appreciated touch!Overall iRacing is incredible the best racing simulator I have tried and if you are looking into the sim racing industry this should be your option if you are debating this game 10000% get it and try it.

I had a intense battle against him. i am just HAPPY to had a expirience like that. After the race we had a little small talk, too.

												I've been a member of iRacing for two years now, and don't regret a bit of it. First of all, the racing format is the best available. Every race is online, with real people using real names behind the wheel. This means there's accountability for your actions. Drivers practice for hours on the track just to do one race, so nobody falls behind the field and due to the ranking systems of Safety Rating and iRating, you'll never see a bad driver again. You have to work your way to racing the best cars.I mostly enjoy racing the NASCAR iRacing Series (half length weekly NASCAR Sprint Cup races) with their 32-car fields. This series really shows off the quality of racing on iRacing. I've done three hour races in this series without a single yellow flag. Wow.I also enjoy the World Sports Car Series, racing the HPD Prototype through multiclass packs filled with RUFs and Ford GTs. Other drivers are respectful and the races are a blast to do. The time just flies by.Great graphics, sound, physics, and most importantly of all, racing. I've used triple monitors and currently use a Rift DK2, both of which have seamless integration.If you're a SERIOUS racing fan that loves simulators, GET IT!			",91,4,18,5,27,0,7

												If you're looking for good and clean online racing, i think iRacing is the best solution available. Nice sharp graphic, very good physics, laserscanned tracks, constant updates and..of course, a top multiplayer racing system. You can drive many different cars around the world, from F1 to GT3 cars, and..for all Oval fans, there's a NASCAR license just waiting you. Just racing with other people around the world. Make new friends, share your passion. This is iRacing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the best simulator i ever drove, and i come back to this after trying others. Everything feels realistic but its missing of some eye candy, graphics motor feels little bit outdated. Runs perfect on maximum settings and without jitter at HTC Vive headset. Other negative thing is you cant test cars on any tracks offline even if you paid those tracks, if you dont have active subscribtion to online races, which is pretty unfair system. Hopefully this get fixed near future and hopefully graphics get some boost, would like to see how unigene 2 would render this one.			",50,8,4,4,9,1,3

												Simpily the BEST online racing sim out there!  Feels more like a career than a game.  I have been a member for about 6 months and have taken part in about 100 races on ovals and 100 races on road coarses.  And I also hold A class licenses in both.  I just recently linked my account to steam so that explains my in game hours.			",6,0,7,2,3,0,0

												What can i say about iRacing? I started iRacing in 2013, and have been playing it non-stop ever since, it is undoubtedly the best racing simulator there is. Official leagues running constantly on the servers, no need to find 20 friends and set up a race, it's all done for you. Plenty of cars available to choose from and also plenty of different series, Nascar (with all the cars and tracks) F1, GT3 (with BMW, McLaren, RUF and Ford GT), Indycar and many others. The racing is clean because of the Safety Rating system imposed on the racers, helpful forums and very good graphics. Both the cars and the tracks are laser scanned, so they are as accurate as in real life. It is not Forza and it is not GT or The Crew... it is a SIMULATOR. And it is the Best Simulator out there. Try it.			",43,2,15,6,10,0,7

												The best sim racing game imo. It is great not only on the physics aspect, but on the community too. The monthly fee you pay is for the service, the uncontable different racing categories in the game, having someone that organizes that for you, the official sanctioned series and the access to the racing servers and forums.The downside is that the game can become really expensive. After you get to class D (which doesn't take long) you need to buy cars and tracks that cost about u$12 each if you want to run in different series. The subscription is for the service, the cars and tracks you will need to buy. Not to mention a wheel and pedals if you want to have a real sim racing experience.I recommend the game, I think everyday of getting back to it, but I live outside the US and the $$ is somewhat unaffordable for me right now.If you like racing and have the necessary $$... GO FOR IT!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Where to start, I wonder. I wish Steam would show my real hours in this sim. We are talking about 1000’s. I joined early 2009 and even I thought this is good, it wasn’t my thing at the moment. Learning curve was really steep because I didn’t know how to drive a race car. Rare are those who do. I was too stubborn to admit it and seek for help, yet there was a huge community to offer it if I would’ve just asked.But the worst thing was the pressure when racing. I could not take the adrenaline rush which was overwhelming. I seriously thought I’m going to have a heart attack, and I’m not alone with this one. No matter how well I did in practice, my hands and feet were shaking so much in race that I couldn’t drive properly. If you spin or drive out of the track, nobody waits for you. If you crash, your race is done. And races aren’t just 3 lap sprints, but even at the Rookie level they last for 20 minutes. You have to stay focused for the whole time, and then you should be fast also. It was too much for me and I quit.I went back to other titles, of which I’ve driven almost all since late 80’s. But I found out that they gave nothing to me anymore. There was simply no thrill in any of them. Racing or other. I felt like I’m totally numb. After a period of time, I renewed my subscription to iRacing and that’s been a big part of my life ever since. Now I need that thrill and I need that adrenaline rush.Iracing can bite you hard sometimes. Frustration can be off the scale. But on the other hand the success feels so good you’d like to laugh and cry at the same time. I can’t think of any other game that gives one so much satisfaction.Iracing should not be approached like a game, and not because of the age old “it’s a sim, not a game” argument. But because it’s a hobby. It’s not a game you play through, or even a sim-like game you play over and over again like Civ, until next version comes out. You can never play it through and it never repeats itself any more than real racing. And not like many racing games out there, you’re not buying a new version anytime soon. Major updates come 4 times a year, and iRacing is planned to be there at least next ten years. This was just recently confirmed.       One can argue over individual aspects of iRacing vs. other sims. And many times other sims win these arguments. But as a whole picture, in all that comes into one single service (and that’s what iRacing is – a service) iRacing is without a slightest doubt the king of the hill. I do, from the bottom of my heart, wish there was some other sim that was better than iRacing. I would buy it in a heartbeat. But there isn’t. So for now I’m going with the best one out there.One thing is astonishing about iRacing, and it’s the fact it does the open lobby gaming better than any other online game or sim out there. That is something anyone has hard time to prove wrong. And since we are talking about an online sim, that is its strongest point. Another thing is the community side. It takes quite some time to understand how strong and wide-ranging it is.I’m not going into actual “game mechanics” here, since I don’t want to get into frustrating arguments over people who don’t take time setup their gear properly and don’t understand the iRacing’s long-term development plan.If you decide to give it a go, be darn sure to go to the forums and ask guys how to set up your system by telling what hardware you got. Someone will reply within 15 minutes. And then, have fun.       ",43,13,9,6,5,0,3

												Best Sim out there for sure! But there's a big but. The membership itself for me is okay. I feel good paying a monthly fee for the game. But you will realize quickly that you only have 6 cars. As your rank improves, you unlock better race classes. You have no cars for these classes and have to pay 12 bucks for each car you want. same with tracks. It can be expensive in the length. For me, its worth it though			",315,78,42,33,69,10,23

												Ive got about 25 hours in this game, not all on steam. Best racing simulator out there. beats the physics of Assetto Corsa, the compatability of rFactor and the scenarios of Project Cars.Price: Joke? I didn't laugh. game is 10.99, for a month, then the game is ripped out of your hands. So basically you pay 50+ $ a year for 4-5 cars and 5 tracks. If you want to race with the other cars, you must 1) Pay 500+ $ (no joke) for the cars and tracks, 2) get the required racing level/grade to race them (so race against pro players until you beat them). Unless you're a trillionare this game can be very expensive.Gameplay:Price away now, pretending im a millionare who put 600$ in this game. Its amazing because of the fact that there are no exterior cameras, no ""hacks/glitches"", nothing unfair, and most importantly: No trollers and bad drivers! Just you, other pro sim racers, the track, and your 4-wheeled monster. No singleplayer AI in the game though, but you can practice on any track with any car, if you bought it.Graphics/Main Menu:No main menu, so its a enternet launched game, kind of like battlefield titles. The website that acts as your dashboard to edit your profile, choose your racing session and join on racers. But, it is very complicated and I recommend watching a video that explains all of it simply because you must know all of it. Graphics are fine, not ugly and not pretty. They match the counterparts rFactor 2 and Automobilista. Ive got a somewhat ♥♥♥♥♥♥ machine and I have all settings maxed out and run it 120fps, because it is such a optimized game. (I haven't tried racing with 70+ people though)Physics:(using G27 with H-Shifter) Nothing to say about it, its the best in the world. Simple as that. But really, I have tried rFactor 2, Automobilista, Project Cars, Assetto Corsa, and it beats all of them. Its hard (just like real life) and it tells you very realistically when your vehicle looses grip. And if you havn't driven a certain car before, loosing grip might happen a lot, just like real life. It is one of the only games that have tought me proper throttle control and brake maneuvers. Car transmissions are also very well simulated. Multiplayer:Once again unbeatable. Given that Iracing has a big price-tag, the devs have worked for many years and have mastered the features of online racing. No lag, no rubber-banding and no intruders that don't speak your language. This game is 100% based on Multiplayer, so if you dont enjoy it, this isn't your game.Best way to try this game is by using a dsicount code (search ""iRacing discount code"") to buy the game. i payed 5$ for 3 months of racing, I had access to a few Nascars, a Mazda Miata, a Indycar and a few other slow racecars, matched with a few circuits including Daytona. If you want to give this simulator a try, i'd sugest using discount codes.			",16,1,9,0,12,0,0

												I got into this with some freinds and I say definatly the best multiplayer racer I have ever played and cant imagine one better! for a single player only experience I would probably still turn to Gran Turismo or Assesto Corsa or a few others. IRacing nails everything, the cars the tracks the physics and the whole experience. Races are smooth and their networks/server is fantastic. Wheel support is awesome, Eyefinity works perfect, optimization is awesome and updates come every season so I will be playing for a long time to come. The community is also awesome. Very freindly, helpful and good conduct. Awesome game, thanks!Cars - constatly added and updatedTracks - constantly added and updatedGraphics - constantly tweaked and updatedCommunity - Growing and awesome/very freindlyWheel/hardware - Supports just about anything.Support - Awesome. I have used Iracing on 2 or 3 systems with vastly different components and screens of different resolutions including eyefinity. Oculus Rift is my next project for Iracing.Price - This can probably be its biggest complaint, although I see the price as a charcoal filter to get rid of the riff raff and people who are not serious enough for a sim like this that might otherwise destroy the very awesome community. Think of it like a country club for serious racers. You know the old saying, if you have to ask how much then you probably cant afford it. Its worth the cost I put into it :)			",138,16,13,19,4,0,15

												Iracing promotes their physics and ""close to realism"" for their simulation.  I have talked with many real life racers who use this and they recommend this sim as it is a close as it gets to the real thing.  Keyword SIM, this is not a game, nor should it be treated as such.  The only thing people might find off putting about this sim, you have to buy cars and tracks.  So, what does it really come down to:  How bad do you want a great sim?  Do  you plan to take this serious?   As with any serious hobby, money and time are consumed for enjoyment.  I plan to race at my local track one day and feel this is the best step I can take next to buying the car and doing it.			",80,4,0,2,15,1,13

												The racing is clean 90% of the time. There are those that drive way over their heads and the system does a fairly good job filtering those drivers out. No other game has tracks this accurate, which is a huge plus in my book. While I can't physically show up at a track like Richmond and start turning laps, with iRacing I can. The community is fairly large, most people are helpful and kind. Again, there is the 10% that give iRacing a bad name with their elitism and whatnot. That's what block and mute are for! I've been a part of the sim racing community for over 20 years and this is the closest thing you'll find apart from a real race car. Yes there are pay walls and a nearly free subscription (if you use credits properly) but you wont find a better online racer. *note for the casual fans, there is no offline or AI. You can practice whenever you want though by yourself or in a game lobby.			",30,3,1,5,4,0,6

												Probably the most competitive online racing you will experience. I had this sim since 2011 so pay no attention to my steam play time.Some of the finer things like physics and drafting may not be spot on but overall the tracks and many of the car packages are pretty decent. It is a great way to learn tracks and improve your times with specific cars. You will learn throttle control, racing lines, braking correctly & getting an overall feel of racing. This is by no means an arcade game, treat it as a true sim.If you wait until around November/December you can get a yearly subscription for $50 instead of $100 and if you have credits you can get it even cheaper.Pros:Subscription is affordableYou earn credits if you race 8 series weeks up to $10 per seasonFun RacingGraphics arent top of the line but decentThroughout the year they have special event racesCons: -Additional tracks/cars will cost you- May be hard for people new to sim racing- You need to work your way up to higher license levels (but this is to prevent vertans with cleaner racing)			",53,4,13,12,25,3,15

												I highly recommend iRacing if your into racing games.  Once your out of rookie license it gets so much better.  You do need to practice in order to improve and drive safely during races.   You can protest races if a racer is not following the rules which can led up to a suspended or being band for sometime.   Read the iRacing ethics and rules to get a grasp on how to race properly.  I play iRacing just about everyday since I became a member JAN 2015.   ""BEST RACING SIM OUT THERE""			",76,6,13,7,17,1,0

												If you want an online sim racer, look no further. Be prepared to dish out a fair bit of money on cars/tracks if you want to expand on what the base subscription offers, as well as a racing wheel - a gamepad just won't cut it. The game has a huge learning curve, as you would expect, so commitment is essential. But believe me, it's worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Having come from Forza I was overwhelmed that there was some where I could race cleanly and competitively without having  to be restricted to organised leagues, everything is very professional but that shouldn't put you off trying iRacing if you are new because you can learn allot about how to drive quickly in iRacing and racing games in general if you are willing to listen and practise. The cars are engaging to drive, the community is great and you can learn a lot from them but the parts I really like are the multitude of race options available such as the possibility of 24 hour races with driver swaps  and the scale of the races you can have with a grid of over 50 cars in a race which is something to really behold. I also appreciate how well the service is supported with 4 major updates a year at the end of each season and staff members post in the forum with updates informing members about upcoming content, upgrades and features.The cost seems problematic but the service and content will be updated for a long time to come so it is a worthwhile investment for the long run, I would say the issue is the potential price upfront. Also hurry up and get those BTCC cars finished and released, they're long over due!			",15,0,10,4,1,0,0

												I've been on the service since 2012, if you want real racing this is it. It may not be in an actual car, but you can't find this level of competition anywhere else. Racing isn't cheap by any stretch of the imagination, but considering the sanctioning body (FIRST) and the numerious sponsorship ties as well as manufacturer support it's dirt cheap to run on iRacing.The penalty system, driver ranking systems, and licensing are strict. They hold people to a certain standard, something no other sim community can match. Especially on such a broad number of disciplines. Mainly due to the direct ties to sanctioning bodies like IMSA, NASCAR, and others.Some may tell you this is a game for hardcore people and casuals need not apply. This is partially true, but if you're truly into racing and want to learn, compete, and win along side other like minded people...... iRacing is the place to be!Note: If you're into any sort of multiclass racing or a Ferrari fanboy, please practice twice as much as the rest.

												By far the best choice for multiplayer simracing. Updated every 3 months with new content and improvements. Full VR support. The automated safety rating system keeps the racing clean and the performance rating helps you get competitive races no matter your skill level. Content can be expensive when starting out and a wheel and pedals is pretty much required, but the volume discounts and participation credits you can earn by racing  (up to $40 per year) reduce the cost significantly.

Along with the several different, officially sactioned, online racing series you have an arsenal of cars and tracks at your fingertips. Only interested in oval racing? You can do just that. Or maybe you're keen to turning right too. You can do just that. I tell people that are starting in iRacing, ""don't treat it like a video game"". It deserves to be treated like a career.

												Best motorsport sim to be had .. period.Did a lot of research in advance before picking up this title to see whether all the fuss and fanfare was justified together with the ""price tag"".Eventually pulled the trigger and what struck me first was the density of features and content available. I quickly realised that aiming for a specific series or two would be the way to go as there was going to be no way of just jumping around between series with any measure of success.Getting in the cockpit of the Caddy CTS-V was a huge eye opener for me and immediately justified the $'s spend. It's a far cry from anything you're probably used to. I like realism and never really got into casual fantasy gaming; usually spending my time with racing ""sims"", flight sims, etc .. i could instantly sense i've stumbled upon something realy special with iRacing.It requires patience, preperation & practice, just like real motorsports. before entering official races. A natural attraction to accomplishing something that is challenging, demanding and that will test you will stand you in good stead. I've never felt actual exitement and nerves when racing as i feel it in iRacing. It gets me every time and is somewhat unique to iRacing in my opinion. The sense of accomplishment i likewise find unique to iRacing. Some will argue subjectively about which of the the big 3 in sim racing has the best physics. In my opinion, between iR, AC & RF2, iRacing blows away the competition in that department; at least in terms of the road racing side of things.Add to this that iRacing is an ever evolving title with quarterly updates in content, physics & features.It's the only place you ever really wanna go if you want the exitement and challenge of wheel-to-wheel racing against real people around the world 24/7.

												(Been a member of service since 2013. Steam stats don't match up the time I've actually spent on service.)For racing enthusiasts, who are looking quality online racing. Service is developing all the time and new tracks and cars, that are done to resemble their real life counterparts with highest accuracy are added to service few times a year.Drivers are graded upon their Safety by rating and licence level, and graded by their ""skill"" with iRating. Safety and licence limit the cars and series you can drive. Getting out from the Rookie licence, can be a hand full. As you, and everybody around you, are still learning.Career vice you can pick either Road or Oval. Or ofcourse both. But they are graded in terms of safety and skill separately.Game costs more than your regular out of the box racing game. With requirement to ""licence"" (buy) tracks and cars, so you can use them, if you want to progress towards higher licence levels. In iRacing a single car costs around 11$, same as a DLC car pack for other games, but you pay for the detail how the car is modeled, not just a re-skinned car with random physics design.No game is without its flaws. Service has had some stability issues during big events. Like Daytona 500. Graphics can be bit out dated and some quite simple sounding features are just missing. But the quality what comes to racing, compared to any public service on online is way ahead. Just get out them rookies...			",6,0,2,0,1,0,0

												iRacing is one of the best MICROTRANSACTIONS game, with full access to laser-scanned MONTHLY FEES and a good MICROTRANSACTIONS community. Unlike in other sims such as Assetto Corsa, here you have a MONTHLY FEES system where you can MICROTRANSACTIONS and race with MICROTRANSACTIONS at your skill level. You start at the MONTHLY FEES level and progress up to MICROTRANSACTIONS level, but you require MICROTRANSACTIONS in order to rank up and MONTHLY FEES with better MICROTRANSACTIONS driving fast MICROTRANSACTIONS.This game has a lot of MONTHLY FEES and laser-scanned MICROTRANSACTIONS, with an outstanding MICROTRANSACTIONS quality that doesn't need to show post-processing MICROTRANSACTIONS and other useless effects to appear eyecandy enough.As I said, this game has a good MICROTRANSACTIONS community. They are open to MONTHLY FEES and constantly telling newcomers how to MICROTRANSACTIONS in order to progress and MONTHLY FEES well.PROS+ Great MONTHLY FEES.+ Awesome MONTHLY FEES.+ A large number of laser-scanned MONTHLY FEES such as WALLET MOTOR SPEEDWAY, LIME DOSH PARK, and more.+ Full support for the MONTHLY FEES, MONTHLY FEES and virtual MONTHLY FEES.+ Constantly updated with new MONTHLY FEES.CONS- Tons of MICROTRANSACTIONS.- You must MICROTRANSACTIONS in order to rank up and get faster MONTHLY FEES.- Community is full of MICROTRANSACTIONS.- You have to MONTHLY FEES every month in order to MICROTRANSACTIONS.TL;DR: iRacing is the most polished and competitive sim you can find, but its pricing model just kills it (for me). You have to have a lot of money if you want to drive virtual cars, otherwise, according to the community, the game is ""not for you"" and ""you should go back to Forza lololo"".

												Excellent sim, and improving a lot over the course of the year.  This sim is growing into something really amazing.  With the addition of the newest F1 car, and some new GT3 cars on the way, this is quickly becoming the absolute best Road racing sim on the market and is pretty much set is stone as the best Oval sim as it is now.  There is an upfront cost but you can start a career here in a frugal and affordable way.  And the money you may spend later on down the road really is worth it if you take advantage at every oppurtunity and really work towards getting your money's worth out of this sim.Getting this on steam is a little bit iffy at the moment, since oftentimes at major update times, there can be some pretty long downtimes.

												Without doubt the benchmark by which all racing sims are measured. The tracks detail is amazing and there is a noticeable change in how a car changes on the same track if you change the time of day. But be warned, getting in to it is a signficant investment in terms of money. You can get from Rookie to Class D without spending a cent, but after that it is almost impossible. If you do not have money to throw I around I'd suggest picking either an oval or road path and sticking to a specific category of racing.Example; if you choose ovals, you will be able to use a number of tracks from D to A license as cars like the National iRacing Series (D); NASCAR Camping World Trucks (C); NASCAR Xfinity Series (B) and Monster Energy NASCAR Series (A) all run on the same tracks, so the investment will be frontloaded. Spend a lot on tracks while in classes D and C and then not much once you are racing the Xfinity and Monster cars.The biggest issue I have though is the amount of tryhards and people that are fast on their own but can't race the minute other cars are around them. Be prepared to have races ruined by people that don't know to get off the gas when in your draft or the tryhards that divebomb you in to turn one on lap one and take half the field out.

												10/10 would divebomb again.EDIT: On the serious side of things, this is hands down the most immersive racing sim I have used at any great length. There are others out there that can match or exceed iRacing in certain elements (Graphically, iRacing is not ahead of the game, but is not trailing all that far behind either). However, the arrival of DirectX 11 has been imminent for some time now, and will take care of that.iRacing is a community. You only have to visit the forums to see how far everyone goes to help each other out. There is a steep learning curve to this sim, and the community have shown time and again that they will help the newbies out. In terms of the quality of racing, this sim is unrivalled. Racers are grouped into races according to their skill level allowing for close racing that is the cleanest I've seen in any racing game or sim. People understand that they can't just divebomb into a corner and shuffle other cars off the road. In many ways you will find iRacing to be cleaner than real racing! There is plenty of scope for personal progression too. The two most prominent rating systems are your iRating, which is influenced by your race results, and your Safety rating, influenced by your incidents per corner over a race. Balancing these two can be challenging, as no one wants to give away position, but if you're aiming to raise your licence level (done by improving your safety rating), then playing the smart game might be the order of the day.Now, iRacing is not free; far from free in fact. Additional tracks and cars will have to be individually bought, on top of the subscription fee that applies. But the trick is to not think of this as a game where you feel you have to purchase all the ""DLC"". There are cars and track that I'm sure I will never buy, and this is because once you've found a car and/or series you are happy with, you'll want to spend a LOT of time practicing and competing there. You really don't want to be racing in multiple cars/series' in the same season. It's not a pick up and play sim, you'll want to research what each series has to offer (the forums are amazing for this), you'll eventually need to look into the basics of mechanical tuning, and you'll need to spend a lot of time in one car to really get dialled in. The competition level here is high and you can expect that other drivers in your race will have put some time to practice a track in. iRacing will draw you into racing like no other sim can. I've found myself buying books on racecraft, mechanics and god knows what else since discovering this sim. So, on the strength of what I have experienced since I joined last August, I can do nothing but highly recommend iRacing to anyone who is willing to put the time and effort into racing copmetitively.

												This is more of a online racing carrer / simulation, than a game. This will demand time, effort, and dedication, and you are only limited by your own skill level. Multiple types of racing are avaible,  oval and road, both with multiple 'carrrer' paths if you will, for open top, gt3, or nascar racing.Expect to have good races, and bad races. But the higher your rating rises, the more likely your races will go caution free. With both fixed and open setup races, the full spectrum of race fan can find somwhere to be competitive. For someone like me, who knows little about racing, fixed setups offer a even field for close racing. For those more into motorsports, open setup racing allows you to change your car's setup to your liking.Do not look at the total cost of all cars and all tracks, that is not the intent of the game. Look at a path that intrests you, and slowly, season by season, work your way up to that goal. Anyone serious enough about racing to have a wheel, stick, and pedals, needs to at least try this service for 3 months, it is worth the price. You will not find better vaule for your money.

 The best online racing simulator I have ever played. The licence & race system is unparalled, with the accessibility of the site making it easy to find whatever race you are looking for. Whether you're a casual 'race anything' type of person or concentrating on taking your first title in a car, iRacing is the sim for you. The pricing seems steep at first, but race enough and it might just work out free in the long term (in about 1300hrs of playtime I've completed multiple championships, which earn you credits to pay for subcriptions).  9/10  ",66,10,36,5,15,0,2

												Been a member for almost three years, if you're looking for a top notch racing experiencing iRacing is unparalleled. The level of competition is just unmatched by the online of any other racing game or sim currently on the market. Be aware in rookies, though. They can't drive. If you're looking to drive street cars against AI or by yourself, this one isn't for you. Be prepared to treat sim racing as a pretty serious hobby if you do get into iRacing, however.

												okay theres a few things all should know when buying this. One the price for all the aditional content is about $800. Each car is usualy $11.95 unless its an old dlc in which case there are a few that are $5.00. The tracks are $11.95 - $14.95 and two are $5.00. Two DO NOT BUY EVERY CAR AND TRACK (unless you have the money lying around). Each car needs to be mastered along with every track and each needs its own level of finess along with learning the best line for each track. But the physics and FFB ar just stunning, no other game can rival its FFB. Graphics are pretty good at max especialy for a game from 2008 im also going to see if i can make get some post processing effects to spice it up. But this game is definitely on my highly recomend list.			",38,1,9,0,12,0,1

												I have been a member of iRacing since November of 2011 and have loved every minute of it. I can honestly say I have learned more about real life racing and race craft through iRacing than anywhere else. The way I watch real life races whether it be NASCAR, F1, or IndyCar has changed drastically.Yes the price of admission is steep, but because of that you can expect everyone to be serious about racing as well. Everyone has their own opinion about which racing game has the best graphics or physics or sound or whatever, but iRacing definitely has the best multiplayer experience hands down.I have found as with most things, you get the most out of iRacing the more time you put into it. There is a steep learning curve especially if you are used to more arcade style racing games, but put in the time and the sense of accomplishment is much greater than just a random achievement unlock.

												While it may be more expensive at first than other racing sims, bulk/loyalty discounts, and the ability to earn credit for racing (at Class D and above) help with the cost. I would say that iRacing is the most fun, intense, and rewarding racing game I have ever played. Not only is it the best for pick-up racing at any given time (please practice though), it's the best for events that give off a true event feel, from the 24 Hours of Daytona (with teammates), to the Indy 500. Also, of course don't forget the many hosted and league racing options available. iRacing is well worth it.			",89,8,17,6,11,0,16

												IRacing is without a doubt the best competitive racing ""simulation"" you will find available. *IRacing is not a game!*This is designed, and built for racing enthusiasts who wish to pursue sim-racing as a ""hobby"".Understand this... IRacing has the best competitive model, you will never find people crashing with intent, driving backwards on the track, or any of the obnoxious and race breaking situations found on many of the lesser sims. By that I mean it is simply not allowed, and no progression in IRacing is possible if you cannot race cleanly.Once you make the jump and commit to IRacing you will find yourself with a minimal amount of cars and tracks available. IRacing has a monthly commitment, as well as in ""sim"" purchases. *IRacing is not a game*You start with minimal access (rookie class) so you can actually learn to race, it is to provide a safety net between new drivers, and experienced ones. If you want to race with the big boys, you will have to prove yourself good enough. This is accomplished through what is called a safety rating. By learning how to race cleanly, you can easily progress through the lisence classes, and race in whatever series you want. It is not advised to jump strait to class A and start in one of those series. But some thought on what you will want to race might be useful, as the financial commitment is pretty high for a single series.I would advise anyone starting in IRacing to get out of the rookie class as soon as possible. (it is there to weed out bad, and dangerous drivers, not the sort you want to be on track with)*IRacing is not a game*			",134,30,31,14,29,4,20

												I have this game before the Steam release, so, thats why I have only the 5 minutes required to write a review, because I play the simulator directly from the Iracing website,. But Ive associated the game with Steam just to write this review.This should  be easy:1.- Do you like racing? yes? so, this simulator is for you2.- Do you want to race against a huge multiplayer community (more than 2000 racers online all the time)? yes? so, this simulator is for you3.- Do you want to race in a well organized environment where almost every driver is worried about clean racing because if you wreck intentionally you will be kick out of the service for three months or forever? yes? so, this simulator is for you4.- Do you want to race when you want because there will be always a race active for you to join? (popular races are scheduled to start every hour, also there are private leagues, and hosts) yes? so, this simulator is for you5.- Do you like Nascar? Do you like road course racing? Do you like F1? Do you like Indycar? Do you like Touring? Do you like GT? yes? so, this simulator is for you6.- Do you want to race in perfect laser official scanned road courses and ovals? yes? so, this simulator is for you7.- Do you want to feel and race with the best car physics in the market right now? yes? so, this simulator is for you8.- Are you a old papyrus fan like me (GPL, NR2003)? yes? so, this simulator is for youSo,..... What are you waiting for!!?? sign up RIGHT NOWIm not going to lie to you, this simulator is expensive, you will have to pay a fee (monthly, 6 months or yearly, your choice) and you will have to buy the content that you want for you to complete the seasons past the rookie license, but as soon as you have what you want you will no longer have to spend a dime, because iracing pays you to race, yeah, thats right, you will be earning money, each year you will make 40$ and after the year iracing will give you another 5$ as a gift, so, that 45$ (iracing credits, only for the purchases inside the sim). So, here is the deal: In the summer or in the black friday sale you can renew the service for a year for only 49.99$, so 45$ that you have made minus 49.99$= five bucks, yep, as you can see the simulator is almost free, and trust me, if you like racing like me that price is a good deal because you will not find anything like iracing, this is by far the best simulator on the world, and the multiplayer is the best thing Ive ever seen in my entire gaming life (and Im a old fart), so well organized, lag free and the community is amazing and helpful.Also, awnser this simple question again: do you like Nascar? yes? really?, are you a Nascar fan? look no further, this is your house, welcome my fellow Nascar racer, Ive been expecting you, this is the real deal, all the rules, the sponsors, the ovals and road courses, the cars, the trucks, and so much more, all in here in iracing.Oh! and I almost forgot!! this is a ongoing project, new deals are being made with the track owners and cars manufacturers for new content (like lemans and the ring, both coming soon) and they are updating the simulation with new builds regularly (for example, dynamic heat on the track surface).Look at this as an investment for your happiness, but beware, YOU WILL BE ADDICTED and the races are intense and so real, this is not for the casual gamer, this is some serious stuff, really.

												This is one of the best sims available. Decent graphics, great FFB, great physics, laser scanned tracks, amazing multiplayer (nothing comes close to the online experience).I played this title for a while on and off steam, and while I was active it was great. Problem is you need to have plenty of free time (which sadly I no longer have) in order to justify the cost of playing this title. If you have the time for hardcore play then this title is more than worth it. If you are the casual player and cannot adhear to scheduling beyond your control then I would recommend checking it out for a month or two to see how it blends with your real life schedule.I have nothing negative to say about this title. As many reviewers complain about the costs - it really is not any more expensive than you want it to be. You are not forced to join season championships. But if you are inclined to join such events then you must buy the cars and tracks in order to compete. But in the long run after you bought those you own them even after the events are over.  The quality of these products are of the highest calliber and are quite cheap for what you are getting.Whether you are the hardcore or casual sim racer I recommend you at least try Iracing - as it is a sim experience like no other.

												Absolutely 110% worth the price. Be smart about purchasing your subscriptions and buy when iRacing has their sales on. Try to find recent promo codes and it turns out to not actually be to expensive!Pros:-Physics are insanely accurate.-Force feedback is hands down the best, feels extremely similar to power steering. (G25)-Car sounds are incredible, also the best on the market.-All other sounds, spotter (and the ability to change voice packs), transmission noise, the clunk when shifting into a gear, the rumble strip sounds changing pitch depending on how fast or slow you drive over them, it's incredible.-Safety rating system works flawlessly in my experience, along with irating and ttrating.-Love the licensing system, and having to work up through your ranks to be able to drive in upper class series.-Super easy to get your FOV setup with the in-game triple screen setup section.-Endless amounts of mappable buttons.-Launches super fast-Servers on their end are also super fast, downloads and updates from iRacing never take long.Cons:-There is no denying that the subscription format of paying is on the pricey side, but it is absolutely worth it if you are at all serious about sim racing.-Rookie class can be difficult to get through as their are a lot of inexperienced drivers that will hit you and knock your safety rating back down.

												A solid racing games, gotta work your way through and spend a bit of money to get cars and tracks, which isn't easy if you haven't got much of an income. The online ranking system is one of kind, and you can just hop on and have a serious race. Most the of community is fair and friendly...if you stay away from oval racing... :-)I would highly reccomend to any sim racers out there. I do have some issues with the game, after playing a few more simulator games, I tend to find that the handeling on this game is out dated. Another issue I have is the inability to create a party with a friend and to join a sheduled race with them.			",68,19,22,5,11,1,8

Posted: July 2, 2015
												I've given iRacing some time over the past 4 months of my subscription. It's finally time I give it a solid review. First things first, iRacing is NOT your average pick-up-and-play racing game. If you think this you are WRONG. It's a racing simulator, so you need to have the proper equipment.Essentials for iRacing:USB Steering Wheel and Pedals (Usually bundled together)Working HeadsetShifter (Unless your Wheel comes with Paddle or Gear Shifters)A comfortable stationary chair. (There are a lot of races where you are going to be sitting for a while)It's possible to see some iRacers on youtube telling you that you need something ludicrous like a triple-screen monitor, or a Force FeedBack Racing Chair system. You Don't. All you need is mentioned above and you'll be ready to race in no time.So, now comes the gameplay. How does it fair to the rest?Racing is very enjoyable in iRacing. The Staff at iRacing really worked hard on making the best and most realistic simulator out there. For example, since iRacing laser scans each track, you'll be able to feel every bump and groove from the actual track. Each car has it's own driving style and you really do have to practice if you want to win races... I know that I've clocked at least 5 hours into this game just practicing Cornering and Turn exiting. How's the variety of cars? There are plenty of cars for each road and oval courses. Road courses do have more of a selection, but I am very content with Oval's selection. I have raced in both Road and Ovals and the cars relatively drive smoothly. I do tend to lean more towards the Ovals however, coming from a NR2003 Season Background. In total, there is a good enough selection of cars to choose from. Which leads me to my final topic, Price.How expensive will iRacing get? In short, VERY Expensive. Cars cost $11.95 for a one-time fee. Tracks range from $11.95 to $14.95, also one-time fee. If you want everything in the game, (Tracks and Cars (Road and Oval)) This will easily cost somewhere in the thousands for the game alone. But don't be alarmed. iRacing gives you a starter pack with around 5-6 cars. and 10 tracks (Don't Quote me on that but I'm pretty sure those are the numbers.) to start with for your Rookie/D-class stages. You don't have to buy everything in one series to play in that series. For example, Let's say you can buy 1 of the 3 different cars, and 1 track. Whenever the schedule changes to that track, you can then race in that series without buying the whole series itself. Conclusion/TL;DR iRacing is an excellent simulator experience. If you want to race side-by-side against other racers, this is absolutely the game for you. Just keep in mind of the price tag. Be ready to throw down some serious cash if you want to be racing continously in the later stages. ",104,5,13,2,6,2,4

												Another excellent racing simulation. What iRacing does best is online multiplayer races. Safety/iRating help ensure cleaner racing and that you are paired with players of roughly the same skill level. With laser scanned tracks that are now dynamic with grip/temp, iRacing scores big points. I've played iRacing for 4 years now and have watched it grow. Things to look forward to in the future will be DX11 graphics, day/night transitions, and weather.Downside: iRacing is easily the most expensive racing simulator going. The subscription costs are reasonable, but if you intend on owning all the content iRacing offers you can expect to shell out big bucks. Discounts are offered to people who own a certain precentage of content or who are purchasing large sums of content at a single time.			",121,15,22,6,28,1,9

												A lot of great features.Even if the developers take it's time to evolve this sim that's the unique feature that iRacing offers. It's always evolving. Every 3 months, sometimes smaller and sometimes bigger updates are released. The passion from the team and the attention to details is noticed. Noticed by users and noticed by car manufactures and track owners something that keeps providing new content on a season basis.Great sim racing community where you can find official and non official events all the time. If you love to race and got no prejudice against oval or road races you can find a little bit of everything on iRacing. It's a training tool, it's a hobby, it's a pleasure to race.Last but no least it may look like something expensive but I must say that, after 7 years, is one of the better investments I have ever done in my life.Kudos to iRacing.

												I've been on iRacing since 2010. This is by far the closest you'll ever get to racing without actually being in a real car. Nothing else compares. Yes the price will scare you but once you've bought the cars and track you want, you never need to purchase them again. All I pay now is for the subscription and that's it. Just think of guys who spend 60 bucks on Madden every year. To me it's no different. Get your self a G27 and iRacing and you'll have a blast with iRacing.Feel free to contact me if you want advice.-As far as the actually sim goes. Just know it takes a lot of getting used to if all your used to is arcade style racing life Forza and NASCAR 15. You really have to focus on your techniques and the car around you. Unlike a lot of other games. -The lag is pretty much non existent unless you have a horrible connection or you're racing people from around the world. -To me this has the best community of members. They have a forum with easy access. You can ask for advice on anything relating to the sim or even life in general believe it or not.Above all, just remember it's a sim, not a standard arcade game. It takes time and focus. But after you get a hang of it, it will become the best sim racing experience you've ever had.			",6,0,2,2,1,0,9

												LOVE THIS SIMULATOR. Been playing for a while now. It just keeps getting better. If you're looking for a sim and not interested in arcade style racing, this is for you. Community is real helpful and lots of leagues. One of my favorite features is the safety rating. To get promoted to the next class, you have to race clean. When you hit another car or put a tire off road your safety rating will get dinged. My biggest complaint about online racing is that racers don't race as if it really matters if you crash. The safety rating makes drivers race clean, more or less. I have a whole new found respect for oval track racing now too.			",47,5,14,6,11,0,8

												Just the ultimate game for hardcore simracer! It's got everything you want. only drawback I see is how expensive additional content is, but if that doesn't bother you, go ahead and get it. Do your research beforehand to see what you're getting and for what you'll have to pay extra, and how much. Simwise, best thing you have out there.Eddit:only, and ONLY get this game if you're willing to dish out a LOT of money for it. I'll give you an example: For a 3 months subscription you will have to pay 30$ without discount (if you check reddit there might be some promotional codes, I got a 3 months sub for 5, but that's for new members only). Now, in rookie events you pretty much have most of the content available. After 3 days of playing I got my D license and was thinking of doing Touring Car Series. However, for those I need 9 more tracks out of 12 to participate in every race. Now, a track costs 14.95, if you buy in bulk you get a discount (cba to look it up) but it's still a lot of money, for 9 tracks you'll have to pay a one time price of 120-something dollars. And that's not even all of them, in total you can easily dish out 1.5k dollars for most of the content (yes, most, not all) and you still have to pay a subscription cost. Unless you have bags of money lying around or want to participate in something else but rookie races (where most drivers are incomptetent, just to get out of rookie classes is started doing bad qual laps and just drive at my own pace cause 50% drivers would crash and take out others with them), look somewhere else for a better deal like Assetto Corsa or rFactor. I'm still leaving a positive review cause tyre physics are great and it has cool details to the game such as tyre deterioration (leaves marbles all over the track) and racing itself feels damn good too.

												A little pricey to get things rolling, but the costs taper off as you race more (because they pay you credits to race). That dynamic beats FTP games by keeping a huge racing base AND that racing base is quality since there are no pay-to-win options that support games that are FTP.I have 1000's of hours in game, but I don't log in through Steam. Well, except this once to let you know that this is the most realistic driving simulator in the world.			",218,98,14,28,23,2,33

												I've been a PC sim racer for many years and I've tried just about all of them.  We're really lucky right now with so many great racing sims out.  To me, iRacing is the best and worth every penny.  Some complain about the subscription model, but I like the idea that the game is in continuous development.  It works great now, but it will keep getting better and better.  iRacing has the best environment for live races, by far.  There is something special about racing live people -- racing AI is very lacking in comparison.  It does have a learning curve, but it is worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been a member of iRacing since, I think, October of '08.Full disclosure - In iRacing I was once passed coming out of Turn 4 like I was standing still by Dale Earnhardt Jr. in an Indy Car at Indianapolis.  I couldn't even keep up in the draft.The review -Excellent Simulator.The ""system"" can be a little daunting and/or confusing for people who aren't already used to it but here are a few key points...iRacing almost always has a 1yr deal around black friday to add one year to your subscription.  That takes the monthly cost down to less than $5.Early on you'll have a Rookie license.  The content that is included with the subscription fee is all you need to run the rookie classes and a lot of what you need to run the Class D series races aside from purchasing a car and generally a couple tracks.  If you purchase three items at a time you get a 10% discount.  This means that after you progress beyond Rookie you'll purchase two tracks and a car or three tracks depending on the series you choose.  You can then run through that season (seasons are 12 weeks) and use your drop weeks to skip the tracks you don't have.  During those weeks you can either practice for next week or jump in another series that runs rookie content for that week to check it out.  After that season you'll buy a couple more tracks and at that point you'll likely have a full season of tracks for most Class D series.As far as the graphics...  A lot of people look at the other sims and see the flashy graphics and special effects and are wowed by that stuff.  I can't say as I blame them :)...  I like Dirt2-3, Dirt Rally, PCars, AC just as much as the next guy...  but those special effects don't happen in real life and in real life the color pallete we see isn't all cartoon like.  Most race sims use VERY over saturated colors.  iRacing doesn't.  It has a much more photo realistic look than other sims.  I prefer that.  Also...  You don't get more accurate car modeling (the mesh) than iRacing.  The cars are laser scanned.  iRacing just switched over to a Physically Based Rendering system.  It's the new hotness.  Star Citizen just moved in that direction too.  They absolutely are keeping up with the jones's when it comes to graphics...  they're just doing it in a different way compared to the cartoon look of other sims.On the physics...A real complaint that many people have is that the low speed (like less than 15MPH) physics feel a tad wonky when over the limit and that the grip on grass is too low.  They've made HUGE strides on the low speed feel with the latest version of the tire model (V6) and...  to be honest...  I don't generally try to get over the limit at less than about 15MPH and once I'm on the grass I'm more interested in coming up with new swear words to mutter at myself than I am about how realistic my grip level is at that particular point.  The cars are a little difficult to drift (but not impossible with the right setup and a car with good steering lock) but slides and proper levels of racing slip are quite nice to feel/deal with.The sound is excellent.The FFB is different to many of the other sims out there.  To be honest I'm a little on the fence about this one.  I like the FFB in iRacing.  It's very accurate...  But...  Other sims offer a more usable feeling when the fronts are scrubbing (You're turning the wheel too far) and when the rears break loose (the FFB ""releases"" a bit) but those effects in other games aren't realistic...  they're over done in order to replace that seat of the pants feel you'd get in those situations in a real race car.  iRacing isn't ""bad"" in it's front tire scrubbing feedback.  It's realistic.  In a real race car you wheel tension builds and builds as you turn the wheel until the fronts start to slide...  At that point the wheel tension doesn't really fall off much...  it just doesn't build more or it falls of a little.  This is exactly what iracing does.  In other sims the tension falloff is exaggerated.  Sometimes I wish iRacing would do that because it makes it a little easier to drive and maybe a little more fun.  Other sims model the slip angle of the rear tires into the FFB.  This is unrealistic.  It makes the other sims easier to do big slides with...  but it isn't realistic.  iRacing doesn't do this.  Therefor...  Slides are a bit hard to catch until you get pretty decent at it.   Again...  Sometimes I wish iracing would do this too...  but I completely understand why they don't.The racing service is TOP NOTCH.  No other sim has anything that even begins to come close to almost touching the racing service.  You can jump on any time day or night and get into a race.  Sometimes there are more people than others but there are always people to race.  The most populated series are the Skip Barber, the Star Mazda, the Mazda MX5, and the BlancPain GT3 series (Ford GT, BMW Z4, McLaren MP412C, RUF RT12 and soon to be the Merc AMG GT3).  I'm not sure which Oval series are the most populated but I believe it's the late model and the Craftsman truck series.iRacing has a Safety Rating and an iRating for each driver.  When you are involved in an incident (No matter who's fault it is) you are given incident points.  iracing chose this ""no fault"" system because in real racing when you get hit or hit someone the results are the same...  You still have to pay to fix your own damn car no matter who'se fault it is.  This will make your safety rating go down.  This affects your license level.  If you don't keep your license level up (it's not that hard) you CAN NOT race the higher class race series.  This does a SUPERB job of keeping people honest.  That's not to say you'll never get hit by someone.  Far from it.  But if you're interested in clean racing you'll get to the higher license classes and you'll have a GREAT time racing :).  The iRating is a metric that keeps very accurate track of preperation level.  Many feel it's a reflection of skill but that's not quite right.  If someone who is VERY good regularly just jumps into whatever race series they want to without practicing and preparing for that series they'll finish at a certain level.  This will reduce their iRating relative to their potential.  If someone who's mid-pack spends a lot of time preparing they can enter a race and finish far ahead of someone who would be faster with more preparation and end up with a higher iRating.  That said...  The racers with low iRatings tend to be slow and not prep well...  and the people with high iRatings tend to be fast AND prep well.It's not too expensive to try it.  Do it.  You'll like it :).  Make sure you poke around on the forums to get your FFB setup correctly for your wheel type.  Don't race in the Rookie class.  Just concentrate on getting your Safety Rating up so you can get into a Class D series as soon as you can.Here are a few testimonials from some people you may have heard of...http://www.iracing.com/testimonials/ ",97,15,7,14,19,0,24

												If you're serious about racing, nothing compares to iRacing.  In other games, when you crash there's no real consequences. In iRacing, if you crash you lose iRating and Safety Rating. If you crash enough you get demoted and can't drive the series you want to drive. It makes a huge difference in the quality of the racing. iRacing is a bit expensive as you have to buy all the content seperately but if you take advantage of all the deals that are offered, it's not bad at all. Being expensive does have it's bright side that it weeds out most of the crashers. When you're in a race, you can be pretty sure everyone around you is a serious racer, atleast compared to other games. And  I love how every few months there's an update that improves all different aspects of the sim. The sim is constantly evolving with new features added every few months. iRacing is not for everyone though. It has a very steep learning curve. If you're the type that needs instant gratification, then this game is not for you. Be prepared to practice for hours before you can hang with the slower guys. And much much longer before you can safely battle side by side with other drivers. But when you do, it's an amazing feeling. Even fighting for 15th place is great fun when battling with a clean and fair competitor, although fighting for 1st is a bit better, sometimes its impossible as there's some impossibly fast drivers on iRacing. For those people that enjoy a challenge and love to push one self to the limit, you have to give iRacing a try. I've been a subscriber for 3 years and I plan on being a subscriber for many more years. Would be nice to have a real competitor to iRacing but I think the market for hardcore racing sims is not big enough to support it.			",25,2,5,0,1,0,1

												I love iRacing. I only recently added it on Steam, but after 250 odd starts, both on oval and the road side, I think I'm qualified to write a little review.So, what is iRacing about? It's a simulator. A true simulator. There are no arcade options or ways to turn down the difficulty. Once you're in it, there really is no going back.. Don't say I didn't warn you.The cars vary from a stock Mazda MX5 to GT3 cars and an F1 car on the road side, and from a Street Stock to Gen6 Sprint Cup cars on the oval side. What I am saying is that there's definitely a car for you to like and enjoy. It's the same when it comes to tracks. Monza was recently added, and with the Nordschleife somewhere in the pipelines.. Well, you know what that means.The community, especially the forums, is also really good. People will willingly share their knowledge and setups if you ask in a nice, polite manner. There have been some issues with rudeness in game, but that is very, very rare.There are some drawbacks with iRacing. First off: It's subscription based. The clever thing, though, is that iRacing gives you credit back for both loyalty and for racing in offical series. So if you claim what they want to give you, as well as take advantage of the sales events (around Black Friday, most often), the subscription fee won't be too bad.Secondly: Cars and tracks have to be bought. I don't mind this, as the work put into cars and tracks is simply staggering. Everything is laser-scanned and perfect down to an inch. It's a small price to pay for hours of fun.

												If it a sim racer then this is the game (imo) for you.The racing is good clean fun with Lots of cars and tracks with great physics and laser scanned so you get every bunp and pothole. You start in Rookie mode and work your way to up to pro (easyer than i make it sound). You can drive road or ovel tracks and pick a path that suits your style of driving.Rookie is where you will find the , shall we say, fender benders but even this is not too bad if you just keep out of trouble and finish each race without any offtracks or bumps.The only thing thatlets it down is the cars and track can cost a lot of real money, up to $15 per track and $11 per car although you do get a few free cars and tracks to get you started. So if you want to race a full season then get ready to pay over $100 and its monthly subscrption fee.So, if you want to play a good simulator then this is it for me!happy driving  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is not just a game, it is an investment....an investment of time and of money.  For that investment though you are well rewarded as this is by far the best multiplayer racing experience you will find on any platform, with a great community around it to help you improve.This is not Forza or Gran Turismo....you cannot expect to be fast using a gamepad, and even with a wheel you will need plenty of practice to be both clean and competitive.  Being clean is rewarded as much as being fast (probably more so) as the ranking system ensures that you are usually racing with people of a similar ability, whilst a per race points system punishes you if you make too many mistakes or are involved in too many incidents.If you are prepared to put the time in then I highly recommend iRacing as there is nothing else like it.

												Lets get down to it, Iracing cost money... for a nice good wheel and stand you you will spend about $350-$400. tracks cost about $14 and cars cost $10. you will also have a monthly fee of $12. you dont need the best computer to run it an entrey level should get the job done. you can play on controller and be good but Iracing is not made for controller so keep that in mind. but for what you pay you get the best racing exp you will find around. it is all track racing (oval/road) not racing through the city or on open roads. you get pitted against other people your skill level and have even a chance to race agains pro racecar drivers. i have raced with NASCAR's AJ Allmendinger and NASCAR XFINITY driver Ross Chastain for example. you got to earn your way up to better class of cars by promotion of license and the only way to promote is by not running in to people and keeping your car on track so you dont get people that dont know what they are doing often. it is not something you can just jump in without practicing so make sure you got some time to set aside.AMD 6300 6 core16 gig RamEVGA gtx 960 FTW editionFPS 60Logitech G27 (wheel)			",178,56,5,12,17,2,17

												iRacing makes it to Turn 2 without a scratch, then keeps going til the end. Very satisfying gameplay, excellent skill progression and ranking, leagues in leagues of their own and a vast pool of local gamers to keep you racing. The only drawback I think is the excessive ongoing cost to play, however for the hardcore sim racer it would be a small price to pay for the benefit of competitive racing.			",2,3,4,0,1,0,0

												Simply put, if you are looking for the most realistic, non-arcade, test your skills sim money can buy, this is your sim.  The one thing I keep hearing from so many Steam user's, ""It's too expensive.""  Look, I'm telling you now, this is more for the hobbyist who wants to go do the real thing but cannot afford it.  Average local short track entry level car costs about five to six thousand dollars to build, and another 500 to a thousand dollars per year to maintain.  In comparison, iRacing is way cheaper.If you do decide to subscribe and run, remember a few things; The system in place is meant to be challenging.  Everyone makes mistakes. Apologies are always welcome.  Race smart, three wide in any car at Texas Motor Speedway in the quadoval is never a good idea. Don't be afraid to lift.  I have seen far too many come in and try to race like this is Gran Turismo, or some other arcade racer.  The whole point is to run competive, clean, and most importantly safe.  Remember, everyone was a rookie once. Patience, perserverance, and lots of practice will get you running in the higher series.  Oh, one more thing I almost forgot, there is always going to be an a-hole in the bunch.  That one guy or gal that just never takes blame and no amount of apologies will suffice.  Apologize, and then ignore them and do your thing.			",106,23,12,33,39,2,22

												Nothing else even comes close when it comes to facilitating close, intense and gentlemanly racing between sim racing enthusiasts......but the price of entry is a serious problem that not only makes the game look bad, but also means that a lot of people genuinely can't afford to race.I firmly believe the iRacing experience is unparalleled, and likely to consume all of your free time - which means the 150-200$ (minimum) you'll spend on it per year probably won't be a big problem. But this game is not for those with little money, little time, or little commitment. Indeed, the money this game costs to play directly correlates with how much time you're expected to put in to be competitive. If you have the money and the equipment, are willing to put in 10-20 hours of practice every fortnight and are interested in sim racing, you will not get a better experience than here. Everyone else should be cautious and spend a couple weeks with the trial before making any commitments.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												iRacing is for me the best online racing game. Competitors know what they are doing. Because of the ranking system, usually there is no wreckfest going on. Since you have to pay a monthly subscription, it keeps the wreckers away.I do not have a very powerfull PC, but still the game is running on higher framerate because you can tweak a lot of the graphic settings.On the downside there is a lot of DLC. If you start late with the game and you want all DLC, you will have to pay a fair amount.			",21,1,10,1,2,1,7

												Unfortuantely I had to change the review from a yes to a no. My review was based on the premise that ""iRacing is expensive, but..."". Well, it's just turning more expensive with a small price increase.The price increase is too small to have a significant impact, but in my review you'll also see that my judgement on the pricing was based on the 50% off subscription discount they've offered twice a year every year. That's when/how everyone I know bought their subscriptions.Coming this summer, the 50% sale is nerfed to a 25% sale. Many disagree, but to me that's a somewhat significant price increase in disguise. There were also commonly big credit discounts, in which you paid $75 for $100 in credits. Those haven't been seen in a while either, and haven't been anounced when they anounced the price increase. Not having access to those discounts means credits got %33 more expensive than usual.At the end of the day it's up to you to decide what's ""expensive"", ""cheap"", or ""worth it"". It's still the best simulator in the market by far, and it is unparalleled on the competitive side of things. But at this point I can't just make a ""yes"" recommendation with a clear conscience. ___________________________________Previous review - 19 Dec, 2015We can already take a couple of things out of the way. If you want a game to play with AI, or if you want to plug in an XBox controller and just bash and bang your car around a track non-stop, then this is not for you. But if you want ""as real as it gets"" racing against real opponents, in laser-scanned as real as it gets tracks and cars? Then this is not at all perfect but there's just no better option than this. Not even close. There never was, there is not at the moment, and it doesn't look like anyone will get any close any time soon.To me the choice to recommend it is easy. Firstly, because I can't stand racing against AI. This is partially because no AI is actually realistic enough, and partially because -- to me -- racing is as much a mental game as it is a physical one. There's no feeling like cracking your opponent under pressure, forcing her into a mistake, etc. This, to me, is the pinnacle of racing and it's something that is not even on the table when racing against AI.And secondly, because of the race organization and availability. I've been in numerous leagues that used numerous sims throughout the years. I've given up on leagues because there were always too many problems with rules, crashes, track cutting, you name it. For a league to be good, it had to stay small. If it stayed small, there weren't enough races. From my days in rFactor, countless leagues even migrated to iRacing. So in iRacing you get the best of both worlds, open/pick-up racing and leagues, around the clock 7 days a week.About costIs it expensive? Yes. Although you can spend as much or as little as you'd like, and with the right mindset you can bring the subscription down to $4 a year. Yes, a year. If you think that is expensive, then this is really not for you either. This is not the case any more. With the new 25% discount in place of the usual 50%, subscription is up to a minimum of $29/year after all credit abatment, and due to raise a bit more in August.[/edit]Also, one thing about this is longevity. Are you into fads that will fade in a couple of months? Do you pay $50 for the latest AAA title that will be part of history in less than a year? iRacing has been around for some 7+ years and it's only growing stronger. Yes, you may spend a few hundred bucks on content if you wish. But you spend only once and that content will still be around in 5 or 10 years time. You don't pay for updates, big or small -- and iRacing is updated at least every 4 months. So the difference when it comes to iRacing's content (cars and tracks) is that (if you even want to) you'll spend that ""up front"". But once you do, that content is licensed to you for good. The longer you stay in iRacing, the cheaper it gets. If in 5 years you divide your expenses by 5*12 you'll see that the monthly cost is, in the end, not that much at all.If you think it through it's pricey, yes, but can hardly be called ""expensive"" for what it is. Of course it can be expensive if ""what it is"" is not what you want, which is legit. In this case, go back to the first paragraph of this review.Pros and consI give iRacing a 7.5/10, really. I'm almost giving it an 8, but not quite. The main cons are probably the bad web interface that takes a while to get used to (although when you do it's ok and fairly functional) and the lack of proper information about the series and race (which is either part of the UI problem or compounded by it). The random racing weather (that should be ""realistic"" but it isn't) and the lack of day/night transitions (or even of a moving sun at all) could also be mentioned as cons.Physics could have been seen as a problem a few seasons ago but updates have been constant and in the right direction. In the last year or so, all cars got more connected to the tarmac, more forgiving, easier to catch in a slide, etc. Also important to mention are the dynamic track updates (rubbering in, marbles, track temp, dirt/grass), the new visual effects (pebbles, grass blades) and revamped sound (which is still missing a lot, but again it's going in the right direction).However when it comes to online racing, online competition, matchmaking, pickup online racing, and anything that involves online virtual motorsports, the closest competitor is around a 4/10 at best. The best you can do then is race with mods, on non-laser-scanned tracks, on guesswork-built cars, and on a league that in all likelyhood only offers one race a week. That, compared to what iRacing offers, is just sad.PS:(if I can give you a tip though, don't buy iRacing through Steam. Go to iRacing's website and buy/subscribe there. You can still link your Steam account later, like I did, and use all functionality, overlay, etc. Trust me, you'll thank me later)			",79,16,17,1,13,3,15

												One of the greatest sim games every played i recomend it to anyone. The only way to enjoy IRacing is by getting a wheel. Controllers or Keyboards wont do you any good. Plus IRacing pays you if you race D or higher if you meet their standards for a series basicly race 8/8 races in one series and you could land $4/$7 depending which series you race.

												Iracing is by far the best racing sim out there.  I have been racing on the service since it opened in 2008 and sim racing since Nascar 1 and Hawaii.  Tons of content, the online racing is by far the best game in town.  I'm mostly a league racer these days but I highly recommend it to anyone that is into sim racing.There are some downsides though.- Costly, really shouldn't have a monthly subscription since you have to purchase all of the content.- You won't get any eye candy compared to more current driving games- I'm not a fan of their license system.  I wish it was per car.- Don't expect to race in big events.  They hold them and the server crashes because they get almost 1000 people to sign up.  - Need to be much better about communication with the community.- Content doesn't come fast enough.

												I'll be as neutral as I can in this review, I have been a member of iRacing since June of 2008.  I've spent well over $1,200 dollars in iRacing over the years with content and sub fees, Each car costs $11.95 and track $14.95 unless it is an tech track like Long Beach.  Once or twice a year the subscription will reduce in price to $49 dollars this is the time to obviously resub for the next year, if you race in ""offical races"" throughout the season in one series you earn credits.. If you race in enough series' you can get enough credits to make the subscription cost I think four or five dollars.   Also, once you buy a certain about of content (all oval, or road) You start to recieve discounts per purchase.iRacing honestly has one of the best multiplayer menus I've ever seen, it's fairly easy to find a race to join and start racing.  I myself only race in leagues and race a couple times a week, it's as simple as finding the right server and entering the password (if it's passworded). iRacing's physics are a constant WIP and to be honest it's missing quite a few things that have been in sim's for the past 10+ years.  Brake fade, parts failures, multiple groove racing, are all non existant in iRacing. Though they are being worked on there is NO reason it shouldn't be in it already after 7+ years on the market.  The 2nd week of March a new build was released, to be honest it was one of the better builds released in a while but with the goods there are always bads.. iRacing once again tweaked the draft model, while it drives decent in the A car (NASCAR sprint cup cars) the B and C cars (Xfinity and Truck series respectively) are both broke.. The draft model now on super speedways aren't as effective as it should be and if you are the last car in line you will lose the draft, my teammate wasn't even a half of a car lenght behind me and lost the draft which is very unrealistic.  The good parts of the recent build update was we finally got the new Chevrolet Silverado and Toyota Tundra and Monza.  Both the trucks look great and I haven't been able to try out Monza as of yet.  Also for leagues that like to use ""fast repairs"" (resets car damage) there is finally an option to uncheck that if you don't want to use it after slight contact.  There also was massive changes to the Sprint Cup car bringing it up to date with the current 2015 Rules package. What I look forward to most is finally getting the next evolution in directX and seeing active race tracks like rFactor 2 has with a live groove.  I also look forward to 24 hour races with day to night transitions and weather that changes throughout the race.In summary iRacing is a fun ""simulation""  that has very long development times between updating the graphics and physics.  It is unlike your typical game where you pay a set fee and price for content, iRacing WILL be expensive but at the same time it help pays for itself.  I would recommend this to sim racing fans only if you intend on spending quite a bit of money. ",57,4,16,2,13,0,1

												Not for the casual arcade racer.  Serious sim with serious price tag if you want to experience everything it has to offer.  iRacing has no equal however when it comes to its multiplayer, rating and license scheme.  You will always find someone similar to your own skill when racing.  I have never joined a race session that wasn't competitive.  Wheel set up is not required but only way to be competitive.

												There is nothing out there matching this title in terms of competitive online play and feel of accomplishment, but it is very expensive. Consider what is important to you and how you like to go about your racing. If you take it easy, pick a few tracks every season and stick to one car at a time it's really not that bad.If you're not a veteran, you'll need tons of practice for every race on every track. So it's not like you're going to go out there and race everything, meaning you don't have to buy everything. Being fast is not everything, you need to be able to race safely to be respected. Racing safely is a new beast to tame for every car and track.Take it slow and you'll have tons of fun and you won't spend too much. This game is best treated as a real racing career.

												Even though this game is quite expensive with buying cars and tracks, for what you get it's a pretty good game. Currently I don't have a racing wheel but I am ordering one. For the time being the mouse controls work okay. Using a controller is god awful don't use a controller with this. This game isn't like Nascar 15, it's quite more intensive on what you do, it's much much more realistic. So with a mouse or controller I wouldn't really reccomend it because it's not quite as responsive but if you have a wheel get it you'll make a great purchase.			",96,7,3,6,15,0,1

I have driven a real true race car... so for me, missing the obvious feel of the car can be frustrating. {gforce and brake pedal feedback... and so on}.  BUT!!! Better than most other sims... that information is there, just in a different way. If your can learn to pick up feed back with your eyes... the game can gets easier.

												iRacing & sim racing in general, is more of a hobby bordering on addiction, rather than just a ""game"". You have to be prepared to walk away with a bruised ego, especially in the beginning, to get the most out of iRacing. Early on you will need to dedicate a good portion of time to practice, to become familiar with the car, the tracks, & the physics. This is a true simulation, so it's not very forgiving. That being said, once you do start to see progress in your abilities, it is one of the most rewarding pay-offs of any ""game"" experience you can find. I HIGHLY recommend playing this game with a steering wheel that has Force Feedback, and more importantly, a decent set of pedals. It may not seem like it, but good pedals will make you faster than a good wheel, so if you have to choose where to spend your money, pay more for good pedals. iRacing is not plug & play, but once you get past the setuup it's the most fun & competitive simulation racer out there.

												Edit:  I ve updated my review to recommend as the latest update to the sim have been very enjoyable for me with the addition of some new vehicles and DX11I ve had this sim for several yrs now and spent $100's of dollars on and sadly its just never been able to keep my attention for more than a single season, and to make it even worse all the content you purchase you dont get access to once your membership expires....nothing more than an over priced rental service and compared to other sims like Pcars, Assetto corsa  & RRE which have far more new tech, features, content and better graphics for the cost of 2 cars and 2 tracks in iracing its hard for me to recommend this titles.Pros:Laser scanned tracksOnline racing community is unmatchedgood ffbBest oval content in any gameSome small discounts once you buy a certain amount of contentDynamic track surfaceYou get a few credits for completing the min race requirements each season, max of $10 per season which you can put towards content or subscription.  If done properly you could put $40 towards a half price subscription and get the price down to $9 on an annual subcription.  Keep in mind you will have to have played for a yr before getting a cheaper membership.Cons:$11 for a car, $14 per track along with an annual $99 subscription which you can get for $45 on sale once a yr.  Since the ingame currency is in US dollars and i live in canada with conversion rate it makes it  even higher on the overal price.out dated graphics....could change in the future with the new  addition of dx11 No AINo singles playerQuestionable physicsit costs money to host a private raceit lacks a few features that other modern sims have...day to night transition, weather and tire flat spottingNeeds add a try before you buy featureOnce your membership expires you cant access any content or even there dedicated forumsVery exspensive start up cost, but if you stick to it and it becomes your go to sim than its worth it and with the series participation credits combined with the annual 50% sale you can get the game for under $10 a yr minus any new content you purchase.

												Fiziği dinamiği falan kıyaslamayacağım. EA sports f1 2000 den bugüne kadar ki serileri ve sonra Assetto corsa ki inanılmaz dinamikleri ve fiziği var araçları sürmek fevkalade zevkli lakin ONLINE yarış diyorsanız kesinlikle iracing. Olumsuz demeyelim de biraz bir yıl kadar 600-700 belki 1000 tl harcamayı göze almak gerekiyor. Tabi bir seferde değil yıl sonu toplamı olarak. Tavsiye eder miyim şiddetle tavsiye ederim.

												They make it excruciatingly hard to unsubscribe to this game. They amount of content that you get for the money does not seem worth it either. Do not pay money for this unless you also have at least a controller, keyboard/mouse combo is not playable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												best racing sim ever, you dont need another one, because here youhave some kind of an online career that builds up forever.No need to rush, take your time and be patience (in the career and in the races).You will notice that you get better and better, maybe in small steps, but it feels good.And you control how much time you invest, its no problem to take a week or so off.or if you dont want the excitement of a race after a long hard day,just drive some practice rounds in your own pace.great physics, great feel, exciting races, everything is very smooth and stable, nice community!

												This game captures the thrill of racing like no other game. Racing actual people and strict penalties for those who mess about makes this ideal for simulator enthusiasts.Be warned: this game can get very expensive with subscriptions, tracks, and car purchases.			",196,54,7,20,15,4,44

												It might not be the perfect racing simulator, but it is the one I've played the most. Despite its flaws and high costs, it is the best place for online racing as it stands. (I have played the game significantly more than what Steam shows, had the game before the Steam release)			",263,39,15,18,26,4,53
