Trials, Wall-E and Grow Home walk into a bar…. And out comes Defunct! Defunct is a fast-paced exploration-adventure game with some racing here and there. You’re a small robot that drives around on one wheel and you’re living on some kind of cargo ship travelling across a post-human Earth. Unfortunately for you, your motor doesn’t work properly and so you can only travel at a fraction of the speed of other robots. Thankfully you’re a smart little bot and you’re equipped with a device that you can use to harness gravity and increase your speed, and that’s good because you just fell off the cargo ship. It’s been one of those days…Full Disclosure: A review copy was provided by the publisher.Please note: While I don’t have a huge amount of game-time I have in fact completed the main game mode (it took me just shy of two hours) but I’ll talk more about the length of the game later on.The first thing you’ll notice when you load up Defunct is that it’s a good looking game. The graphics are by no means cutting edge and a few of the textures are a bit bland but most of the game’s levels take place in bright and colourful biomes which do indeed look great, particularly the desert biome levels. The actual models for the player’s robot and for other robots and vehicles you come across are all great. On the subject of your robot’s appearance, there are paint jobs which can be unlocked in the game though I’m not certain what the unlock requirements actually are.Once you’ve stopped gawping at the game’s appearance it’s time to actually start playing it. You have two ways of increasing your robot’s speed. First off, you’ve got the broken motor which will get you moving, even up steep inclines, but it sure as hell is going to take its time about doing it. Your little motor is really just there in case you run out of momentum in the middle of a level or there’s a hill you want to get up. Now the other way of getting around is a lot faster and a lot more fun. It’s called the gravitation engine. The name gives an idea of what the engine actually does, it uses gravity. It’s mainly useful when you’re going down a hill of any length as a way to increase your speed. Going down the hill will give you a speed boost anyway, that’s how forces work, but when you use the gravitation engine you’re effectively ‘pulled down’ and as you can imagine that makes you pretty zippy heading down a hill.Now accelerating is all well and good but it’s pretty pointless if you can’t keep that speed. Defunct’s fast-paced sections are all about getting to a high speed and then staying there. For the most part this means you have to pick out a route through the level that’s going to keep you downhill or at least flat-ish for most of the level. You’ll also find two kinds of speed boost pick-ups, one which gives you an immediate and rather short boost of speed and one which is stored in a tank and gives you slightly more bang for your buck, especially if you get an entire tank of the stuff.I eluded to the fact in that last paragraph that Defunct isn’t the same all the way through the game. Depending on how you look at it, this is either a good thing or a bad thing. While most levels do require you to keep your speed up to some extent, possibly to reach a battery that’s high up and needs to be activated, there are some parts of the game which are quite slow, usually the up-hill sections. Personally I wasn’t too keen on the slower parts where you’re metaphorically plodding along looking for stuff but they do offer a good opportunity to take in the world around you. Speaking of the world, now would be a good time to talk about the fact the game has eleven ‘main game’ levels and a further five levels which are made for the time trial mode only. As I said earlier the main game took me just shy of two hours to beat and since the levels are roughly the same length that works out to about ten minutes per level. The length of the game doesn’t necessarily make it a bad game and with the time trials and collectibles there are reasons to return to levels you’ve previously played but when you consider the price of admission I’m not convinced that it’s worth it.The time trials are where the Trials mention in my title come from. Depending on the level you’ll have a certain objective to complete, such as pass through a certain number of points as fast as you can. While the time trials are pretty fun they are pretty much just bolted on to the game as the same levels with a different objective. There are medals for certain times so if you’re a completionist you may be able to squeeze a few more hours out of the game. While most of the levels are reasonably well suited to the time trial mode a couple of the longer levels felt like they didn't really fit in a should have either been shortened when playing time trial mode, i.e. remove the battery objectives, or skipped over completely.Just a few more things to mention. There are a couple more gameplay mechanics, tricks and a magnetize engine, but they don’t play a huge part in the gameplay as a whole and the game does a good job of explaining them. The game runs very well, I’m below the recommended spec for my GPU but I was still able to run it at 30FPS on max settings though, as others have mentioned, the game does suffer from occasional FPS drops. There have been a couple of complaints about controller support not working correctly but I didn’t have any trouble using my Wireless 360 Controller. Lastly, while there is a story there to give you purpose for moving through the levels, it’s pretty too basic to be at all interesting which is a shame because the robot is a pretty cool character.Verdict Worth Purchasing on Sale. Defunct is a fun little adventure game with good graphics and gameplay but it’s let down by its length and price. If you’re a big fan of time trials or you enjoy completing games to one hundred percent you’ll probably get your money’s worth but if not then I’d recommend picking it up when it gets a sale.Lone Ranger Reviews.El K.

												I've been following this game for a year or two now, was excited when I saw it and had doubts along the way thinking that they've screwed a what seemed like a really fun to play game, and now that it's out and played it from start to finish, I can confirm that it's a really fun game that looks good and has a high replay value.At first you might not like the game based on that you think the game is annoyingly slow, but after you've fiddled with the controls and start getting more experience as you continue on playing it til the end, you'll see that the game is really fun.The game's campaign is argubally short, but once you get the hang of the game, the replay value is great and you'll spend a good few more hours replaying levels again and again and trying to get a better score in time trials.It's just a fun game that's definitely worth the asking price if you're willing to keep playing til the end and adjust the game's controls to your liking for you to preform at your best.Just hope that the game sells well so that the developers can (hopefully) make and release a level editor with community levels pumping up after =)			",589,105,8,19,53,5,36

												Extremely satisfying gameplay, short story mode, high replayability.  I played through the story in about 1 hour, but there are still tons of things to find in the levels.  It's a lot of fun just zooming around looking for secrets and alternate paths through the semi-open-world levels (it isn't truly open world, but you do have a lot of freedom).  The game does a good job of creating a sense of speed and rewarding skill: it has a high skill ceiling and is difficult to play well, which makes it that much more satisfying when you hit a line just right and blast through a level quickly.  It feels like there is a lot of replay value if you're an achievement chaser and you enjoy the core gameplay.  It's going to take a lot of time to find all of the secrets and unlockables, and then an even longer time to beat all the time trials.  I'd guess it's going to take me 20+ hours to 100% the game.If you think the gameplay looks like fun, and you can see yourself playing through multiple times to finish all the achievements, unlocks and time trials, I think you won't be disappointed.  If you're the type who plays through the story mode and then uninstalls, you will find it to be too short.			",243,46,5,24,47,4,44

			A review of the newly released ""Defunct"" from Freshly Squeezed A Short Adventure / race game with a major focus on time attacks & Speedrunning Review code was supplied free of charge.		

the short of it is:- Responsive & Fast- Great aesthetics- Great mechanics for it's design- Great for time trails, score attacks and speedrunners. It's REALLY well designed for this.- Rebindable Keyboard & Controller keys- General performance on all ranges of systemsthe bad: - Length. it's VERY short.  If you dont like speed running, this game will make you sad and wil  last no more than an hour.- FPS Drops randomly when switching zones.so, from us a recommendation if you enjoy speed running and time attacks, but if you dont... i'd wait and see for a sale, because the game is tiny.

I was supplied with this key by the developer, this however did not affect the review.Gotta go fast...or at least try to. Defunct is a game about a little broken robot who has gotten lost and is trying to get home. Despite malfunctioning a little and not reaching the same speeds as his robotic buddies, with enough momentum he can really zoom. This is a simple game, most levels are just you rolling towards the end goal while some add certain goals and puzzles. A great title for those into speed runs.There isn’t much of a story here, your robot is lost and you need to help it get home. Because of this, you can finish the main game relatively quickly, it’s a bit too short. To make up for it, there are also time challenges and a scoreboard feature so if you want to be the best of the best that adds a bit of a replay factor. Defunct also offers trading cards and achievements to unlock that add a bit more depth and add a bit more time into the game.What I noticed first about the game, however, were the graphics. I wasn’t very good at this game and it’s not the kind of game I’d normally play but it looked so beautiful and smooth I wasn’t mad at it. The robot his adorable without ever speaking a word, the worlds are mellow and rendered well. It also has fun music to listen to while you get your race one as well. Aesthetically the game is a winner. Only downside is some of the terrain seems to repeat a bit since you spend most of the game on a post-human Earth.Did I mention I’m bad at this game? Because I am. Despite this, I was still able to enjoy and play the game, the controls are not complicated, the first level has a quick tutorial on how things work and after that you’re on a roll. Pun intended. You can magnetize yourself to stick to metal, allowing some upside down fun. You can use gravity itself to speed up downhill or slow down uphill. You can jump and even use your broken motor to putter along if you need help. Getting through the game requires a mix of all these things as well as performing a few tricks from time to time.If you have a need for speed then grab this game. It’s well done, it’s fun and it’s good for speed runners. Only thing that might have made it better would be a co-op feature so you can race against other players. Also, the game is a bit on the short side so you might want to grab the title when it’s on sale. The soundtrack alone is a pleasure to listen to, so pick it up as well!For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!

												Defunct:~~~~~~~ Being a robot can have its problems . . .  well, look at yourself - you look like a unicycle centaur	 with a broken motor! The only good thing about you is this special apparatus which can separate gravity around you. Use it downhill and you will reach extraordinary speed.  Defunct is a racing / adventure game where you control a unicycle robot who was accidently flushed out from a cargo ship. Your goal is to get back to your vessel before it is too late. You will crash land onto a planet inhabited by robots; after all this game takes place post human race. In the story mode, you will move from one level to another. Pick up all the collectible items within the level (they vary from one level to another) and make sure you gather as much speed as you can. It is really all about using your gravitation engine when you are going downhill, but you will be able to use the blue roundish orbit to give you an extra boost. If you are losing momentum (especially uphill) do not worry, you still can use your broken motor to move forward! One thing I really like in the story mode is that in some levels, you will have to power up a pylon to open a door/crate to the next level.  Time trial mode is very hard, to be honest, but fun! You have to reach your destination under a time limit to score a platinum medal. You will be able to freeze the clock each time you pass over the one second icon. In my case it will take some time due to the fact I have a tendency to use the gravitation engine uphill and keep missing the one-second icon. However, I do have an excuse . . .  I only have three fingers on each hand!I really enjoy the gameplay, the levels are well designed; they are fun and the game runs very well. Graphically, this game looks great. You can unlock skins for your robots, which is a nice. The controls are well balanced which makes this game really enjoyable to play.Positives:~~~~~~~  -	Great graphics-	Fun gameplay -	Story and time trial modes-	Good replay-abilities-	Achievements and trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~-	Some levels are too long (vast) for the time trial mode Defunct is a very good game and it deserves to be on in your game library!8/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

												This game is at least as cool as it looks in the trailer!I haven't finished it yet, but i think that I played it ""long"" enough to give my overall opinion:PROS:-Playes smoothly-looks awesome-good music-nice, interesting story-varied levels CONS (Just minor stuff):-you can't ""look around"" (could have been easily done with right analog stick)-animations in cutscenes are a little bit slow and reused to often, witch makes them slightly anoying every now and thenSo should you buy it?YES!

												Amazing game that doesn't get nearly the playerbase it deserves, check it out, it's worth it. It's particularly worth buying if you like super fast travelling in vast landscapes and time trials. The story is kind of short but the time trials, which surprisingly are really addictive (normally I am not such a fan of those), the secrets and the unlockables keep the replayability sufficient.

												While I may be biased, as I am friends with one of the developers, I still enjoyed the game a lot. It's a little bit on the short side, but the gameplay is solid. It has a great sense of speed, great art direction, and a cute little story. There are also a few  extra stages for time trials, which are fun. The time trial mode is enjoyable too, and focuses more heavily on the aspects where the game shines the brightest; it's speed.After beating the game once, I still feel there is a lot I missed, which offers some replayability.

												Defunct is a mix between Sonic, Tiny wings and a arcade game. you play as a little one wheeled robot trying to get back to his ship. Youre enginge is broken so you can only move very slowly with the enginge. You get speed via a gravity device that pulls you towards the earth. You use the and momentum to get around. There are also boost pick ups that give you boost. The graphics are really apealing and very cartoonish. The only problem is its lenght. 1 playthough took 41 minutes. I will play it again and try the time trials, but it is still short. I would only recommend this game at 50% discount.			",383,62,12,32,26,3,50

I'm just a casual gamer who normally wanders around aimlessly a good bit and i still finished this game in less than an hour. still giving it a thumbs up but for the price i wasnt expecting to beat the game before dinner. please make more levels, how about a playground, or some bot upbrades like a motor, or jump upgrades, or maybe a level editor? I though for sure when i got back to the ship that i would get some movement upgrade, and good times would ensue... This was too good of a game to end here!			",44,8,6,1,2,2,1

												I really wish steam had a neutral rating, because thats what id rate this game.In the end though, it just didnt give me the fun I was hoping for. Sure, you can move fast in this game. Really fast. However, there are too many things that get in the way of you simply being able to get there, and stay there, where you can just enjoy going fast. The mechanics behind building up speed are too much of a pain to maintain your speed, and the controls when you are going fast, are clunky. This results in only short periods of speed, followed by lots of times when you feel slow and broken, as you try to find a way to build up your speed again.The physics seem off too. Its just missing something that gives you that feeling of ""im really going fast"" that other games have had in the past.Again, its not a bad game. Doesnt seem at all buggy, the graphics are simple but effective, and the soundtrack is great. I just found myself struggling to want to keep playing, mostly because game mechanics seemed to get in the way of what I wanted to be doing in the game.My advice, watch some lets play vids, then buy it if you still like what you see. My thumbs down rating is not me saying, ""Dont buy this""... its me saying ""I didnt have much fun with it, so be careful""			",553,120,3,120,41,2,77

												Speed Rush Guarantee.At first i thought what a garbage. Collect keys only ? Serious ? I think the Devs are kidding but find out by yourself why.I promise you wont regret it. Speed or stunts ? it is your flavour because the Game wont tell you how to do it.The Levels are designed in way that every new game is a new experience.Pro,1. Graphics are okay (Comic-Style) ,the levels looks nice and detailed wich give a good atmosphere. I would say it is good for an indie-game.2. The Controls are intuitive. Easy to learn but hard to master.3. Good OSTCon.1. Sometime it stutters on my system but it is old.I think if you have a average PC you can ignore it.I bought it for just 1.50 € (Sale) but i would pay the full price too because it is worth every penny.I am a extreme critical person and if i say this is awesome then it is really rare.Kind Regards.

												Unused JunkI have to say I am disappointed by this game.  The art style suggests it could fit right into Ratchet and Clank and there was a great deal of potential with the concept.   ""Not used"" is an accurate description to most of this game.  The graphics are clean and pretty to look at, the levels are wide, open and leave any places to explore...if only there was something to find. The huge and detailed zones are barren of anything gameplay related, making any exploration almost pointless, and I have to wonder why.  It very much seems that there was a lot more planned, a much deeper game set up then the one we got,  and all we are left with is a very very basic speed and puzzle game.  There is junk scattered all over this world that suggests a much more expansive story, and strangely the other robots first instinct when finding the junk seems to be to set up shops.  You can't interact with any of it yet there is enough of it scattered around and some in town like groups that really says something else was suppose to be going on.The controls are not bad, but unoptimized.  I recommend changing the setup if possible.  There is no mouse look, which I find odd.  There are sections that can bring Sonic like speed only to be abruptly stopped by very basic puzzles only made difficult by the controls.  Oddly, how you get through most levels does not seem to matter, as there are half a dozen routes in each, which only made me feel lost as I barreled forward, unsure of where I was going or even if it was the right way.In the end I beat the game on the first go, all of an hour and 10 minutes, and I have no desire to play again, or explore the content that unlocked on completion.  Support the developer for the graphic content, maybe they will make a better game, but skip this one for the game play.			",288,67,1,32,11,1,57

A Speed-Focused Exploration Adventure Game

+ The gameplay is a ton of fun. You play as a robot with a broken engine. Using momentum and gravity you pick up speed as you go downhill and journey across very wide landscapes. The gameplay is very similar to games like Tiny Wings, where you gain speed by going downhill and lose speed going uphill.+ Fantastic level design. The levels are very large, open, and have plenty of slopes, hills, and jumps to encourage you to go fast wherever possible. They are also fairly short with some beautiful environments which keeps the game feeling fresh the entire way through+ Visually the game looks great with some very detailed environments and nice lighting- The game is VERY short. It encourages replayability, but the game itself took me less than 40mins to get through			",2904,1026,99,265,347,21,392

												A game about using hills and momentum to build flow and speed; the game that 3D Sonic games wished they were. The little robot is a delight to control. Perfect if you're looking a time trial/speed run game. If not, the main campaign will maybe take 60-90 minutes your first try; it's still worth experiencing for the great aesthetic and the simple joy of zipping around, but perhaps wait for a sale.

												Defunct tries to harness the swooping mechanics of Tiny Wings for an adventure like Journey or Flower, but, although at times it gets up to speed, it doesn't quite stick the landing.There's a kind of weightlessness to your character—as if the game is set to be a little too fast—that makes it frustrating to navigate any given path.  You might spy an opportunity to race along a wall and jump off onto a bounce pad to reach some high platform likely hiding a collectible, but even if your approach is perfect you will probably miss the pad or hit it and then slam against a rock wall; the angles involved are just too fiddly and unpredictable.Because moving efficiently so that your speed stays high is enjoyable (and kind of the whole point of the game), it's frustrating when you're failing to do so.  Even though there are no consequences, it's annoying to constantly be trying to do cool things but not have enough control to pull them off.  This doesn't feel like a game that can really be mastered with any amount of practice.It's also quite a short game and not altogether satisying, lacking as it is in any real danger.  I mentioned the collectibles; these are there both to provide replay value and to create an incentive to explore various criss-crossing paths built through each area, but trying to find them not only keeps you engaged with that fiddly frustration but also outright kills the momentum as you stop racing forward and turn back to search them out.  Secrets just don't seem to be a good fit for this kind of game.  It's more fun to keep a straight course to the end.Despite its flaws, I do like Defunct, and I resent Steam's binary review system for forcing me to give it a ""not recommended"" because it's a sweet little game that I think you should pick it up and give a play—but only at a steep discount.  I just wish it were better.  It has a lot of unmet potential, a promising machine badly in need of some tuning.			",1435,539,33,180,108,9,233

												I was lucky enough to get my hands on an early version of the game and I just finished the main story.It's difficult to classify this game. It's an adventure, but not a point and click adventure. It's more an adventure where your protagonist are forced into an adventure. It's not a classical racer either, because you aren't racing against other people in the story mode. There are however challenges that you can unlock. You can also ""race"" against other players online. So you have a time to beat, time challenges. The best way to describe the game would probably be adventure-exploration racer. The storymode is fairly short, I believe it took me around 2 hours to complete. Which is a bit short. I did however know where to go, because I have played an even earlier version of the game. As explained earlier though, there are unlockables and a time challenge in the game, so it has a replayability value.I wager to say that the feel of the game is fairly unique. The developers did a good job with the gameplay and the graphics. Levels are well thought out. I'd say buy it for a unique, cozy and an awesome experience. There's no game like it.I enjoyed the experience immensly. Well worth a buy!			",222,65,10,21,17,3,56

												It's a fun game with innovative mechanics and pretty graphics.The controls are easy to learn and are quite intuitive. But because accidentally gravitizing when going uphill can be detrimental to your speed, it becomes very rewarding with increased proficiency of the controls. It's when you're whooshing effortlessly across big, open landscapes that this game really shines. On the other hand, hitting trees or debris (which you'll inevitably do occasionally) isn't being penalized to the same extent, which is nice.The levels are varied and mostly non-linear in nature. You often have many different paths to take or orders in which to take on challenges.My only gripe with it is that it's somewhat short. Definitely replayable, you have both collectables to collect and time trials to beat, but community-made maps or lengthy DLCs would be a nice addition to an otherwise great game.			",18,2,0,5,1,0,2

												The core mechanic and level design of this game are just incredibly fun.  The levels are huge, the sense of speed is great, your options with pathing through a level are many.  If you think of a really good Sonic game, that rush of flying through a level and finding new ways to complete it is here.Make no mistake, the mechanics in this game are tricky and will take some time to learn.  You won't be soaring through the hills like you see in the trailer on your first runthrough.  Fortunately, the main campaign has enormous replay value and it's very rewarding to get better and improve at using it.  This game is definitely worth it for the price and I'd be really excited to see updates down the road.			",174,85,4,17,11,3,12

												Don't trust the trailer. Well, sort of trust it. It shows a game that's all about going fast, which is great. Sometimes that's what the game is like, but sometimes it's not. Defunct is at its best when it looks like the trailer - when you're racing over open terrain, chaining together boosts, making smart use of the whatchamadoozie to speed up down hills, figuring out ways to preserve your momentum uphill... all of that is great. What's less great is when the game decides that you need to unlock a door before you can continue. This requires you either finding keys or blowing up little red... things... to power up... some other thing... to let you move on. In these sections you're given wide open areas to play around in.Here's the thing: opening these doors? It's not hard. It's not even that time consuming. So on the whole it doesn't detract *that* much. But it's a little disheartening to be on a tear, blasting through terrain almost as fast as the game can load it, only to then be ground to a halt so you can go do some mild platforming bits. The same is true of a few other sections, where it's not a door that blocks you, but a jump that's unmakeable the first time, so you fall into a pit and go through a convoluted new path to get back to the jump from another angle. And a few little interstitial moments between chapters where you putter along with your Broken Engine, watching other lil' robots zoom ahead of you.None of these sections are bad enough to sink the game, but they stand out for the wrong reasons. It's a little bit like the 2D Sonic the Hedgehog games. You'll get one or two stages built for ""Gotta go fast!"", and then you'll get that Pyramid Stage from Sonic and Knuckles, or Casino Night Zone from Sonic 2. Sure, they're fun(ish), but the game gives you mechanics centered on speed, then drops you in a level not made for speed. Defunct occasionally feels the same way. ""Let's make a game all about movement, but force them to slow down every now and again."" If it was intentional, I think it was a bad call.Fortunately, while those spots do stick out like a sore thumb, they are relatively few. Most of the time, Defunct is all about cruising at high speeds and navigating tricky terrain, and it does both very well. If you gun it through the campaign (for lack of a better term), it should only take you 30-40 minutes, but it's the kind of thing you may want to play again, this time trying a different path, or next time trying to collect all the doodads, or even putting on some music and just enjoying the ride. tl;dr: It's short, mostly sweet, and replayable. Solid purchase.			",360,94,16,52,29,6,35

												Defunct is a nice casual speed game. Simple mechanics that are addicting to use. If you like the idea of gravity/ramp based speed this game is great for that. It is on the shorter side yes, but to be honest this games mechanics are so fun you'll probably replay it a few times. There is a bit of a competitive side to it aswell, with time trials and such. So if thats your cup of tea Defunct has you covered there aswell. All around a great game to get that nice feeling of speed. 9/10 for how good this game does what it set out to do.

												Nice piece of game. Mechanisms are totally original and fun to play. However I feel confused all the time. Given it's an adventure game it's not necessarily a bad thing, but I found myself picking the easy routes all the time because 1) the fast routes are generally too difficult and require a ton of trial&error 2) I weren't even sure if those are the right ways because map's too open-worldly.It's really a beautiful and delicate world. It'd be nice if I didn't feel defeated all the time.			",445,116,5,74,57,6,61

												I have mixed feelings about this game, but I am giving it a positive review because ulimtately I think the game is worth it.The game is fun, that cannot be denied. The core mechanics of this game is something I've never seen before. It's simple, new, engaging, and satisfying. It feels great to chain together good downhill runs to get up to an insane speed. It's creative. It has a nice looking asthetic that is also not very taxing  to a lower end machine. But the game is short. Really short. I got to the end in about 45 minutes without going out of my way for collectibles. I'm telling you guys now, so you all are  not allowed to whine when you buy the game and are finished within the hour. This is the biggest issue with the game, and the one thing that had me questioning whether it was worth the 15 bucks. At the end of the day, I do think it is worth it. It is a fun game.Ultimately, what Defunct did for me was get me excited about a potential Defunct 2, and it made me want to pay attention to the developers of this game to see what they do next. It is short, but there is a lot of great stuff in here. I am excited to see what these guys do with an abudance of rescources and time.			",178,14,3,17,32,0,19

												Defunct is a very short game, as is evident from my 'hours played' counter, but while it does last it is an enjoyable experience. The game involves controlling a tiny little robot as you traverse various biomes by manipulating gravitational pulls to enable you to move at incredebly fast speeds. It's kind of like Valley meets Wall-E. The sections where you race down a hill and break-neck speeds are exhilarating but the game also consists of sections where you must slow down and explore a given location to solve certain environmental puzzles. These breaks serve as a nice change of pace between sections of whiplashing speeds down sloping terrains. The only problem I had with the game is that the puzzles lack creativity, I feel like they could have done much more with the existing mechanics. Features like being able to magnetize to surfaces allowing you to ride sideways and upside down are barely utilized. Sure, the game gives you many places to use it but rarely any incentive to use it. The other complaint being that it's just so incredebly short that I can't really recommend the game at full price, however if you happen to pick it up on sale, like I did, then I'd say it's worth it. It's the best 3D Sonic game that was never made.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I actually though that i am aware of every new indie title which hits steam, because i always look up new entries. But here i am, finding this 3 months later in a sale. Not a good job of steam, it should advertise indie titles some more, because this is a really good one. The Game:You create momentum/speed by holding down a button while driving downhill. That is really fun and feels awesome. But you can also break and stand still, its not one of these games where you run automatically and you just have to press some buttons to dodge barriers. You have full control of your robot, you can explore as slowly as you want, have to find keys sometimes to advance, or activate some switches.Everything else in this game is well executed. Solid controls (gamepad), solid cute graphics (60 fps), animations. Music is there, just a little boring for my taste. Levels are varied, from far stretched hills to cramped indoor locations.Overall: highly recommended.			",282,88,17,33,13,0,7

YouTube™ Video: Defunct Review | Show and Tell | Defunct Gameplay 

			Views: 502		

			Defunct Review and Gameplay. I was hoping for a lot more to this game, though there is certainly some quality in the story.		

Defunct is an odd little game that I really wanted to love, but in the end, there was too much holding it back. It’s a 3D platformer all about speed, and using momentum to quickly traverse the levels. It’s got a Wall-E quality to it in terms of the theme, with what looks like an abandoned human planet now occupied by little quick robots.PresentationThe developer clearly understands style and colour. There are a lot of sections of the game, most notably sections like Oasis, which really pop out of the screen. The environments were really varied, with desert highways and meadow-like hills neighbouring unrealistically, but welcomely, near each other. It’s a shame that, I feel like, there was some pretty gross framerate drops and it always seemed to happen in the pretty areas. The thing is, Defunct looks good from afar, but bad up close. The textures are really low res, even with the setting at very high, which makes the cutscenes look pretty damn ugly. Luckily for the majority of the game you won’t be looking at the textures too up close, and you’re supposed to be going fast, so it should be that the environments are a hypnotising blur of colour as you traverse the landscape.MechanicsUnfortunately though, that was the real issue with the game. The game is definitely at it’s best when you are travelling at high speed, jumping from platform to platform smoothly. The issue is that it’s too difficult to keep up momentum most of the time. 90% of the time I was able to identify the path I needed to take in order to do awesome jumps and travel quickly, but the handling of the character is so finicky and slow I could almost never do what I MEANT to do. I do think there should be challenge in games like this, but it should be based on your reaction times and making snap decisions to travel in certain directions, not based on whether or not the volatile physics of the engine want to agree with you. Far too many times I’d be travelling at high speed, feeling great, and then smack into a wall because I was travelling TOO FAST and missed the platform I was supposed to land on. And if the pacing of the game wasn’t being undermined enough, there are these weird puzzle-like sections where you slow down and collect batteries to power up the door that lets you progress. The gameplay is fun when it works the way I want it to, the issue is, it almost never works the way I want it to, and it becomes frustrating. Maybe the game would be more fun for someone who spends a lot of time with it and gets familiar with the controls, but my bet is that is not going to be the majority of people.StoryThe story isn’t anything crazy. You’re a little robot who fell off his ship, and now you have to return to it. Even so, there was some surprisingly satisfying story beats, and that’s backed up by an interesting world that tells you a bit about itself just from looking around the environment. For example you see old rusted cars and highways around the place, so you can gather that humans used to live here, and the music is often your que that the story is progressing. It’s little details like that that make this world one that you want to be in. There’s also some really interesting sections of the game where your character is supposed to be feeling a certain way, and it’s reflected really well by the mechanics. For example, during a moment where there seems to be little or no hope, you’ll find yourself having to push yourself up hills, and failing jumps that you could easily have made with a bit more speed. The mechanics of the game allowed some of the story to be told, which I think is really cool.VerdictIn the end, I finished this game in 90 minutes. That’s short, but for the right price that can be reasonable. The price the developers gave me was 11 euros (I am writing this review pre-release). Converting that, is 12 dollars, so the final price of the game could be anywhere between 10 and 15 dollars in the US, probably 12 or 13 dollars. 13 dollars is way too much. 10 is better, but still not really a good price. This should be a $5-7 game in reality. So the price isn’t great, maybe pick the game up on sale for around the price i recommended, but even then it’s gonna depend. If you appreciate an interesting and sometimes quite pretty world and a fairly satisfying story; oh and also can look past frustrating mechanics? Sure. Buy it on sale. Otherwise, I’m going to have to say avoid.ScorePresentation: 6Mechanics: 4Story: 8Price to Quality Ratio: 4Personal Enjoyment: 4Final:  5.2/10(the final score is calculated from the average of the sub-scores)Defunct is getting a score of 5.2 out of 10. So, you know, maybe a tiny bit better than meh? The story was the driving force of what got me through the game, and the presentation was pretty good all around leaving aside the textures; that said, the mechanics were flawed; 12 dollars is far too expensive for this, kind of, meh experience, and I just found myself frustrated most of the time.

												This game is just a lot of genuine fun. Not the most advanced or the prettiest looking but I found myself just riding around for a while and I was totally content.			",142,19,1,13,17,1,16

												A short game, but a lot of fun. It definitely has some replayability. Grat value for money.			",292,71,6,28,26,1,38

												It's really fun, can be completed in 2hours, that's without focussing on collectibles.I've had 15 crashes in 4 hours though. So it needs some fixing up.			",153,35,1,13,7,3,9

												A very short, but also very nice experience. Love the feeling of getting a lot of speed, getting air off a jump, having the little robot do a trick, and landing on a slope to keep the speed. It all just flows together very nice once you get the hang of it. There seems to be quite a lot of the levels to explore and decent amount of collectibles to give it some replayabilty.

												A very nice and short game all about manipulating gravity to create a rolling flow. At times, it got super fast too. The character is also very cute. Worth the money.			",269,64,9,11,9,0,8

												This was a great little game and made for a good let's play.I liked the cute little guy and his struggles to get back to where he belongs to.The game looked great and all the mechanics worked well.Still a few things for me to do as I need to find all the secret areas and collect all the collectables but I will do it.

												Defunct is a short platformer with great movement and acceleration mechanics. There's plenty of replay value due to a strong timee trial system, and there certainly is a lot of speedrun potential if you're looking for a game like that			",107,29,5,21,16,0,11
