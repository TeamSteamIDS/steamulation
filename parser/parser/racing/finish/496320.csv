												Running Gods is an amazing fast-paced Indie game with really good music and some excellent obstacles. You play as one of seven gods which can compete with each other in xbox mode or single player obstacle run. This is worth a buy now before it becomes incredibly well known and overplayed. Nice game! I have made a quick playthrough of the game on my channel here:

			Today I play a brand new game called Running Gods! You play as one of seven gods. Running and trying to pass through and past obstacles. It is a fun and relaxing Indie game.
