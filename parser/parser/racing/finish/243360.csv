												+ Simple and fun gameplay which is easy to pick up and learn, but hard to master. This is the kind of gameplay that only TrackMania can deliver.+ Very skill-based. No gimmicks or anything, it's all about shaving off milliseconds with precise and skillful driving.+ Great graphics.+ User friendly track, car and replay editors.+ Lots of community created content.+ Tolerable community.- Ubisoft thought it'd be a good idea to split the environments into seperate games, which means that the already small player base is also split. As a result, pretty much every server is empty and there's only around 3 populated ones at a time.- The car physics on dirt are overly sensitive and difficult to get used to. In fact, they don't really feel like TrackMania. Protip: Try to play on a keyboard if you're having problems with a controller.- 5min cooldown on official races. Was this really necessary?- You get only one environment. At a price tag of $20. I suggest buying it on a sale.TrackMania² Valley is also a solid racer, but it's not as alive as the other games thanks to Ubisoft's great idea of splitting the games into several titles.7/10 ",582,79,29,50,49,3,30

												Highly Recommended Game!This probably is the best Trackmania Environment ever made!It has an astonishing variety; you can create easy-driving tracks, Off-Road tracks, Stunt Tracks, Insane Full-Speed Tracks ecc...You have a very large selection of blocks to choose from, and the editor, as usual from Nadeo, is great!I strongly suggest buying this game both if you are a fan of the franchise or not!You won't be disapointed.One last note on the graphics, which really shine in this package!Amazing light reflections, gorgeous environments, volumetric clouds and whatever you might imagine.An amazing game all-around.Definetly a must buy!

												For veterans, this is my favourite of the TrackMania² environments. The car handles on tarmack better than the other two. If you liked the Island environment, I would say this one is the closest to it of the three. Keep in mind, however, that it also contains dirt tracks which are more like Rally. I also think this environment is the most beautiful, though they are all nice in their own way.If you're new to TrackMania, let me say that TrackMania is AWESOME. It is basically a time trial game, but what a game! The driving is not realistic. You will do tight turns, stunts and drifts. You will drive at ridiculous speeds, stack, and try again. You will make a tight, high-speed turn, followed by a jump, fly across an enourmous gulf, land, do a loop, and then crash into a finish line. Or miss, but eventually you will succeed.And then there is the extraordinarily powerful (AND easy to use!!) level editor, which has led to large community of excellent user created tracks and multiplayer servers.

												This game most certainly gets a lot of hate, but I feel personally like this is a worthy title for racing fans. However...This game doesn't run very well AT ALL on lower-end gaming PCs. If you want a Trackmania game and you don't have a great PC, stick with Nations Forever.Off-roading is much more difficult in this game in comparison to its counterparts. Using a controller rather than arrowkeys is strongly recommended for this particular game.I have seen Trackmania getting a lot of hate from parents because their kid didn't like it. Trackmania is not the kind of game to just pick up for your kid. This game especially is very difficult at times and can lead to frustrated outbursts. Generally best for very experienced racing gamers or people who don't take anything too seriously.Many parts of this particular installment seem unrefined and slightly sloppily assembled. Sound and music tend to cut out a lot especially. Custom-made tracks don't seem to have this problem quite as badly, but I would still recommend listening to music from another source while playing this game.Overall, however, I would say this is a good game. Controls are basic and the gameplay is straightforward. The Vally setting is gorgeous and the track editor is fun to mess around with. Physics are closer to those of Canyon, except with looser steering and slightly more difficult drifting. Takes time to get use to the unique phsysics of this game, especially on the off-road parts, but you will eventually get the hang of it.			",84,1,8,4,4,0,1

												By far the toughest entry in the Trackmania 2 collection of games, but also very rewarding. The smooth drifing of Canyon is long gone. 99% of all braking you do on pavement will be in a straight line, or else your run will almost definitely be ruined. This is something you should know as you go into the game. It's not as easy to pick up and play as Canyon or StadiumThe crazy high speed tracks are still here, but dirt tracks are a fresh addition. A lot of them are actually pretty reasonable tracks, but that's not to say they aren't as much fun. At high speeds, keeping control on these can be a nervewracking experience. Stadium and (to a lesser extent) canyon both offer stretches of dirt, but this is a totally different beast altogether. It's a different game, but it's still ridiculous, it's still fun, and I still want just one more try before bed, mom.Recommended for: perfectionistsNot recommended for: recovering addicts			",191,32,11,14,5,1,9

												Stadium is better IMO because it has more population, more community generated content, and more persistent playerbase than this game.Racing gameplay here is largely based on rally racing. Note that the car steers very well, and can handle sharp turns.  But, it doesn't do so well at high speeds and will spin out at any attempt at braking.  As such, racing tends to be more technical than drifting related or fullspeed.This was the third of the TM2 series, and its the most graphically polished, however TM2 still excells in content.Note that environments are canyons, concrete roads, and stadium-like structures.  There is a fair balance of natural environment blocks and manmade blocks, but they cannot be mix and matched.  Road blocks are for road, and aesthetic blocks are for aesthetics.  It can also be very hard to create beautiful maps here, since good maps require smart placement of foliage, buildings, landscaping, and roads.However, this game is beautiful and its fun to play. It comes 2nd in my recommendations of the Trackmania 2 franchise.  Note this is the most graphically taxing of the TM2 franchise to this date.			",93,19,4,10,4,0,5

												TrackMania 2 Valley brings all of the improvements and excitement from its brother game, TM2 Canyon.The Valley car is noticeably more touchy than the Canyon car, and the tracks on Valley provide almost no room for error and some scattered instances of cheap randomly placed geometry to instantly stop your perfect run. Valley is obviously for a more experienced crowd, providing something less of a joyride than TM2 Canyon and more precise than the easily accessible TM2 Stadium.Stadium-like wide open spaces at least give you room to pilot your finnicky automobile, but things work out a lot worse once you attempt a rally track. The car handles easily enough on road with big, wide turns; dirt and rally sections of the track require impossibly accurate feats of countersteering that DEMAND the use of something more precise than a keyboard (all gaming pads that you can plug into your computer are completely compatible with TrackMania).If the idea of piloting a beast machine of a vehicle over rally roads and moonlit interstates is exciting to you, Valley delivers a compelling caricatured sensation of real racing, more so than any other TM game to date.It can cause equal parts frustration and satisfaction, so if you are looking for more of a joyride, I suggest you buy TM2 Canyon or TM2 Stadium first.

Create your own maps, skins, 3D objects and new 3D cars, scripts, mods for the environment and much more. Overall a must have, at least if you ask me ... ;D			",1687,677,83,235,277,32,326

												TrackMania 2 Valley is a rally car racing refeshment of TranMania United Valley pack. Does Valley hold up to the original and is it worth your money?Graphics:I'm just going to be short and sweet. At max settings, this game is georgous. Everything from the lighting to the amount of detail on the courses is excellent. I sometimes found myself slamming into a tree or careening off the track simply because I was distracted by the enviornment. My only two gripes with the game's visual presentations is that water doesn't animate when your car moves through it and it can sometimes be difficult to tell where to go on dirt roads or courses that have fragmented roads due to the heavy amount of detail.Soundtrack:Trackmania 2 Valley has my favorite soundtrack out of the three packs available. It's rather groovy, consisting of electronic music that's easy on the ears. But thankfully, you are able to add your own music to the game if you grow tired of the limited soundtrack. Gameplay:Of the three packs available, Valley has the steepest learning curve and because of it, I don't think it's the most ideal selection for newcomers to the TrackMania series. Throughout your playthrough you will have to adapt to the stiff yet fluid control of the asphalt to the incredibly sensitive to the touch controls of the dirt. Thankfully the staff created tracks provide a great amount of variety with progressively challenging courses to test your driving skills without seeming unfair. The keyboard controls work, but a gamepad or wheel are much more favorable. When your done with singleplayer, you can dive right into the online multiplayer to test how your times compare to players from around the world on courses that are either staff created or custom. Where TrackMania shines is the Editors mode, where players can create tracks with an incredibly deep track creator or play the creations of another person.  So in the end Valley is a phenominal improvement over its TM United counterpart and is worth every penny.But as stated before, if your new to the Trackmania series, I would reccommend either raising all flags in Stadium or Soaking up some sun in the Canyon. But besides that, this is a must buy for racing and Trackmania fans.			",81,2,4,10,1,1,13

												Trackmania has always been a unique racing series and really fun to play in my opinion. However, it has always been overshadowed by more mainstream racing games (Need for Speed, Forza, Gran Tursimo, etc.). Trackmania² Valley specifically though is the most realistic of the Trackmania² line, but this doesn't mean it's bad. It still has your insane tricks and high-speed action, but it feels much more sensible from Trackmania² Canyon and Stadium, and in my opinion, more fun. It's much more grippy then Canyon, but still has enough power to easily drift unlike Stadium. It's an arcade game in a nutshell, so if you (for some reason) hate arcades, then you might want to sway from this, but if you want to try something unique, I highly reccomend this. The main attraction I'd say in Valley (and basically all Trackmanias) is its track creator, which makes the game have huge replay value, as well as the community tracks.			",63,30,28,13,11,2,14

												Hmm I don't know if I should put all the enviroments into one review on Valley but I'll do it anyway.If you played the original Trackmania then this shouldn't be a surprise because everything is particulary the same, which is a good thing! I've loved the original Trackmania since I've seen about it back in my middle school years. Played the demo of Trackmania Sunrise and enjoyed the series ever since. I met some really good people and friends and actually played competitively in this game, but it didn't last long.....sadlyNow here we are with the next Trackmania game, with improved visuals (which looked amazing) and a lot more options with editor (objects, scripting, etc.). Since I was a really into trackmaking, (and I still am!) I really enjoyed experimenting the new block that they offered. The replay editor is more of the same with some new features that I can't say but I know for sure that all of the old editing equipments are still there. I like the fact that now I can take a screenshot of the car moving without having to shoot a video and screen capture it from my computer. What I also like about what Nadeo did is that they added a simple editor to the replay editor for beginners and not just the editor mode. All the enviroments are very unique from the looks to the driving style. Canyon is more of a drifting enviroment whereas Valley is more of grip to slidy dirt sections. I like the fact that they didn't change any of the aspects that made Trackmania great and added new features. Manialink is back and from my experince it hasn't changed, but I never really looked at it often. I recently looked at the paint editor and Nadeo seemed to changed some the UI. I can't really tell since I didn't really put the time to mess around with it. I also really like the fact that Steam is intergrated with Maniaplanet, but the the negative side to is that most of my friends don't have Trackmania, so it's kind of pointless to me. Ok now lets talk about the three enviroments.CanyonCanyon was my first experince that I had with the the new engine that I played a year ago. I really enjoyed the handling and the drifting aspects of it. It's a great representation of the Arizona desert with large canyons and little plant life. I like the fact that it's easy to drive but hard to master because seeing how the competitors drive this car is utterly insane. I do have to say it's the least that I played so far, even though I put a lot of hours in it. The one thing that I do get annoyed is that the vehicle snaps when I'm counter-drifting. This only happens when the car was about to straighten itself out.StadiumStadium for me is the new remastered version of the previous Stadium. I do have to say that surprisingly they changed the physis in this enviroment. The vehicle seems a bit slower than the origanal enviroment and the handling is less stiff the the previous. I still enjoyed the enviroment regardless becuase this was the enviroment that I played the most from the last Trackmania (Nations ESWC and Forever being free). I really like the improved lighting effects in this game, it gives more of a beautiful look to the enviroment. There were also some new blocks added to this version! What I did feel dissapointed is that the bugs are still existant from the last game, but it doesn't interact often. Like for instance when landing on the dirt portion on all four tires causes the vehicle to slow down. Another bug is that when the tires touches the side road on the asphalt, the vehicle will randomly lift itself in the air. It might seem small but from a competitive standpoint it's annoying.This being a remastered version of the origanal Stadium, I'm glad that they sold this for 10 bucks.ValleyValley I have to say is an intersting track, to say for the least. And what I mean by it being interesting that dirt section. Not only it's hard to control since the car can easily oversteer if turned to much. For people that doesn't have a medium/high spec PC, it can give performance problems thus making it less enjoyable. I do have to say that this envioment is the most exqusite out of the two. It's a beautiful reference to the Euproean Nations and even thought it doesn't really have the ""valley"" in it, it's still somthing to look at everyonce in a while. After playing it for so many hours and trying to get the hang of the handling model, it becomes really enjoyable, making it my favorite enviroment.If you're a new player interested in this game or a old veteran trying out the next Trackmania game, please give it a go, try the demo. You wont be disapointed.TL;DR, It's a really good game that I would recommend playing!			",69,8,37,4,6,1,1

												Yet another Trackmania environment. Although I don't like the idea of releasing the 3 environments separately, causing the community to split, the game itself is REALLY good.The visual graphics are stunning, there's so many details around you (specially on dirt tracks). Great textures, extremely detailed reflections on your car, the lightning, it's byotiful. Could be used to run benchmarks.Gameplay wise, it's pretty much the same on any other TM game: Easy to pick up, hard to master. But the car just cannot turn while driving in high speed. Drifting is also not very recommended, only on dirt. I still don't understand this car in its entirety, but I like it.The track editor is perfect for people who want to unleash their imagination. It's not unnecessarily complicated, and gives you all the tools you could ever want. Tens of thousands of tracks were already created, but the possibilites are endless. You can post your tracks and skins on the Workshop.TM² Valley is a cheap, fun and visually appealing arcade racing game which you can either play for 30 minutes on your free time, or spend many hours mastering all tracks, gaining all medals and messing with the track editor.But honestly, who the hell thought that splitting the environments was a good idea?!

												After getting the complete version of TM2 during the Steam Winter Fail 2016 (Most of the discounts weren't my cup of tea), I have one thing to say about this game compared to the only other TM game I have played, TM Sunrise.This game will TEST YOU. It will test you to no end on your precision and how well you can powerslide without sending your car careening into a lampost. One you get it down, you can get that adrenaline rush that the whole of Sonic The Hedgehog wishes it could give you. Getting medals is also a challenge, even with the lower difficulty tracks. I just go for silver medals in single player, because the golds are basically MLG pro (At least they don't quickscope you the moment you get in the lead). The only problem I see with single player is currently, I don't think you can have multiple opponents to race against. Solo is 1v1 the whole way through (As far as I can tell). The physics are still what you'd expect from trackmania: go fast and you'll win, but you might wind up launching yourself off the track at that bump in the road or fly off at the next dip in the road and put yourself into a roll that costs you your silver medal.Complimenting the challenge is the great aesthetics and performance. My computer runs this game at near perfect frames, and the vibrant color palette (DAT SKYBOX BE DOUBLE-D SEXY) makes the game pop.This review is just based on my completion of all the white-flag challenges, so my experience can't say the same other players.In the end, I say that this is a good installment in the Trackmania franchise, and worth my 20 bucks. I recommend you do what I did, and grab it before the Steam Winter Fail ends, or wait for the next discount on the franchise. Fans won't be disappointed (Maybe).			",40,3,3,10,11,0,3

												This is the best game I've ever bought. It's sad to see people saying that the handling is broken and all wrong. It isn't. If you put in the effort to learn how the car reacts & drives, you will see that it really is amazing (yes, its hard at first but it is not broken).The graphics are amazing, and it is well optimized for those slower computers too.The blocks in the track editor are incredibly well designed, so you can think up hunderds of combinations & transitions between blocks.If you know how to handle a 3D modeling program, you can also make your own blocks, cars & scenery to use in-game! It also comes with a built-in painting editor for your cars.You can make your own movies with the in-game movie/replay editor, so the possibilities are endless :DThe online community is the most frendly I have ever seen in a video game, so you'll rarely run into idiots.If you don't like how the cars behave in Trackmania 2 Valley, remember to check out Trackmania 2 Stadium or Canyon. All 3 games have the same features but each with a different environment & car.I can fully recommend this game, but remember to try the demo first.Pros:- Fantastic Graphics- Can build your own tracks- Can modle your own cars, blocks, or scenery- Endless replay-ablility- Deep car handling (you really build up a 'feel' of how the car responds)- Runs pretty well on slow computers- Very friendly online community- Built-in video/replay editor with lots of effects (Depth of Field, Colour Grading, Colour Control, Custom Cameras, etc)Cons:- The handling takes a while to get used to(Can't think of any other cons :P)Note: It will say I only have a few hours of play time in this game, but thats because I play the non Steam version. I have played over 430 hours on this game, and it still hasn't got boring. Thats how good it is :P			",44,6,33,2,6,0,0

												FFS, UBi. Really? So my acceleration bindings have mysteriously disappeared. No problem, right? Just reassign it. Oops. There's  bug there. Trying to reassign a key causes the program to crash so hard that only hitting the case power button can get you out (which also obviously causes Windows to shut down).Head to Steam forums. See a thread where somebody is having issues. Solution is don't rebind keys. There's a bug at the moment. That thread was from February. *Looks at calender* May 31st.Gee whiz, thanks Ubi. This is why you're so beloved. Thanks for this worthless POS I now own.Why am I thanking you? You say this wasn't a gift? I paid money for this? Damn, you're right. I guess that makes me an idiot then.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Maybe my opinion is coloured by nostalgia but didn't the older trackmania games use to be a lot more fun? The key gameplay mechanic on these games is to retry the tracks repeatedly to find the perfect line through the course and beat set times. This is fun when the cars are easy to control but in this game when driving off road the handling is so twitchy you just have to fight to keep the car on the track and you can't think about improving your line. This increased difficulty means there is a significant number of tracks that I will never be able to play. Even despite that this just features race events and none of the other types of event from previous games. With that in mind the price tag is quite hefty for what you get. In my opinion the pinnacle of the series was Trackmania Sunrise eXtreme but good luck finding a copy of that and getting it to work on Windows 7 so my recommendation is to get Trackmania United, it is much better value. The only positive this has over United is that the graphics are better.			",128,95,10,4,4,1,8

English:I would prefer half a thumb up for TrackMania ² Valley, as it is not worth it if you have already played another Trackmania ² (as I Canyon). It differs only in the location (and that is even worse), so I think it's rude of Nadeo that they make it into three gameplay-equal cash investments (I'm obviously an idiot fell for it). However, for those who have still played no part of the series, it is recommended with 5 out of 10. Anyway, I would rather play Canyon: The reason is in the review of that game!Deutsch:Ich würde Trackmania² Valley am liebsten einen halben Daumen geben, da es sich nicht lohnt wenn man schon ein anderes Trackmania² (so wie ich Canyon) gespielt hat. Es unterscheidet sich eben nur in der Location (und die ist sogar noch schlechter) und daher finde ich es unverschämt von Nadeo das sie daraus gleich drei vom Spielprinzip genau gleiche Geldanlagen machen (Ich Idiot bin natürlich darauf reingefallen). Für alle die allerdings noch keinen Teil der Reihe gespielt habe ist es mit 5/10 Punkten zu empfehlen. Ich jedoch würde eher Canyon spielen: Der Grund steht in der Review dazu!			",29,1,3,2,1,0,0

												I loved trackmania for many years, but with this new mania planet system they've had for a whie, it just frustrates the hell out of me.  The amount of stuffing around just to get something done.  I just want to join a quick match... gotta wait for mania planet to load.... wanna change my settings ... gotta pay planets, BUT my account isnt validated yet so I cant spend my planets.  HOW THE HELL is it not validated?!  I'm on steam, I bought it through steam and signed in with my mania planet login ages ago. How many gates of authentication do you bloody need!!!Theres no quick easy way to get a validation code either, I gotta go digging through all my old emails to find it, OR gotta get a new one sent.Stuff it.  I should have never bought this game. Nadeo's current mania planet system is just added busy work when I just want to quickly and casually play their game. Won't be playing any more.

												This is, in my opinion, the most unique environment ever seen in Trackmania.[/h] Tracks [/h1]Trackmania has always been known to never dissapoint in terms of the single player mode - and I loved every second of this one. You almost never see the same style of block placement twice, and there is always a new technique to master on these tracks. It combines sections where you have to be slow and technical with how you drive and fast sections with jumps and loops and really exciting and crazy stunts. It's all threaded together perfectly, and it never gets boring at any point within the gameplay.[/h] The Valley Car [/h1]Anyone who has played Trackmania in the past knows this well: all the different cars have their own handling characteristics and driving styles. For example, the Coast cars are slow and slippery, and have to be driven carefully, while the Stadium cars have loads of grip and can hit insanely fast speeds. The Valley cars are like none other, both in how they handle and how they look.It's not comparable to any production car I have ever seen before, making it a completely original and new style to me. The handling is amazing. It's easy to drive at high speeds, easy to predict, and easy to push into a powerslide, but it is impossible to master. Those simple mechanics are what keep all those online players playing: Because it never gets boring.[/h] The Verdict [/h1]Trackmania is just one of those games that never goes out of style. It's always fun to play, and you can always learn a new driving technique to use on any of the enormous number of tracks both contained within the singleplayer mode and the multiplayer mode. Easy to pick up, impossible to master, and overall a blast to play, for all age groups.10/10.			",22,2,8,0,4,0,0

Why should you care about my review?I am a father of two boys, ages 3 and 6 and hold a BA in Game Design (although I work as a database admin - tough to leave a job of 15 years to pursue the ""dream"" of game design with a family to support.) That aside, we use a HTPC with Steam in Big picture Mode launched from XBMC. With a wife and two young ones, everything has to be remote and controller friendly. The games also have to be kid-friendly. If you find yourself in a similar situation and trust the opinion of a trained game designer (but not professionally working at it) - then read on.edit: since I bought the Trackmania three game pack, I am posting the same review in the other two titles as the pros and cons are the same for all (except for Valley, which has a Con unique to itself - see below.)Pros-- The game was cheap. $20 for three games (Stadium, Canyon, and Valley) during the Steam winter sale made this something worth trying out.-- Despite not having an ESRB rating (that I could find anyway), the games are kid friendly. Physics are loose, no bodies are flying out of cars, you can restart at a spawn point on the track, facing the right way (important for the three year old!) at any time you get stuck. I can start a split-screen game and choose a ""playlist"" for the kids to race at the same time. They're happy, I'm happy.-- The game is fun. Stunts, fast cars, loose physics, respawns, tricky tracks, loop tracks, various difficulties, time trials, medals, rankings. And I haven't even tried actual online multi-player yet. I'm not too interested in that part so I won't review that part of the game at this time.-- Game runs smooth. I've experienced no crashes (the game software, not cars!), no jerkiness, graphics are decent, controls on a 360 controller are easy enough for the three year old to win races against his big brother occasionally.Cons-- The interface is severely lacking. Poor design choices abound. To launch the games, Steam launches another launcher (ManiaPlanet). In this new launcher, you see all three games you purchased (after you installed them all). However, if I click on ""Stadium"" from Steam, then decide to play ""Canyon"" in the ManiaPlanet (MP) launcher, it says I have to restart the game I want from Steam. What's the point of this extra layer of launcher then? Stupid design.-- The MP launcher is not controller friendly. This means I have to get the keyboard out just to be able to arrow down to the ""Start Game"" button. You can't hit it with ANY button on a controller. Once that's done, you can use the controller in game, but not in this MP launcher.-- Selecting items using the controller is poor design. Blue text turns a bit ""more blue"" or slightly brighter. Arrows that are white turn slightly brighter when selected. The wife and kids can't tell what the heck they're navigating. I know about this and I can barely see this on a 42"" screen. It's clear the interface is designed only for mouse. The controller does work, but it's not easy to see the navigation. This means I have to setup the game for the kids. I have to get them into the tracks, I have to change playlists (or games if they want to play Stadium for instance.)-- Kids can't get their own profile. I tried setting the game to use ""multiple profiles"" but the feature is nigh-useless. I attempted to create a profile for my eldest so he can have his own rankings or even just his own car model when playing split-screen. I didn't want him to access online so I created a local profile. Now none of the games launch. They say ""You must connect online to launch the game."" I did say LOCAL account didn't I? Again, stupid. So I tried to create a new profile using my already created online account (cause I couldn't get the games to run even by myself before doing this.) The game wouldn't let me do that. Only one key per account it says. I tried creating a new account to the same effect. They want you to buy the game again just so you can use multiple profiles. So to recap, you can't create a local profile without connecting it to an onlne account and you can't create multiple users under one account and you can't create multiple online accounts without buying additional licenses. Stupid.-- Due to the above, the simple feature in almost any racing game, choosing a car skin, can't be done except by the online profile. So my kids playing in split screen have to settle for the plain gray cars and my eldest can't keep his own records and scores.-- Car engine sounds disappear when you select High quality Audio (you have to keep it at normal).-- Some of the tracks are way too difficult for really little ones (not a knock on the game, just something to be aware of.)-- Controls are not consistent between solo play and multiplayer. For example, the respawn button by default is the yellow Y button in solo play. In split screen, you push down (click the button) on the left analog stick. I'd like to remap it as the respawn button on the steering control leads to accidental respawns However, it doesn't seem to ""take"" as it looks like it's tied to profiles, which as mentioned above, I can't create.-- the in-game HUD is awful. Everything is so small it's pointless on a big screen from across the room. Thankfully the kids don't care about this info, they just want to race. Worth noting.-- this Con is unique to Valley. In the other two games, we can begin a split screen game by selecting a playlist of tracks and the game starts, We can race each track until a player gets 30 points (3 wins) or whatever we set it to be. In Valley however, the playlists don't work - it dumps you into a script programming screen which is blank. I don't feel I need to spend time figuring how they screwed up programming the install of this game just so we can play multi-player playlists like the other two games. Frustrating.ConclusionThere is just too much stupidity in design to overcome for me. So if you find yourself with a media center that also serves as a game machine for the kids and are looking for a fun racing game the little ones can enjoy. I'd consider this title at rock-bottom prices otherwise I'm recommending you go elsewhere. You simply can't do simple things other racing games can, nothing is intuitive, the interface is awful (both menu and during racing). Despite that, once you get a race going, it is fun for the kids. So the core gameplay is ok, it's all the design elements, the spit and polish that surround the game that is severely lacking good design. If you want fun big-screen family room entertainment, local split screen multi-player, racing game - go get Sonic Transformed.If you read this far and are just looking for a single-player or online, match-making, stunt racing, beat the clock game - why did you read my review? Didn't I write at the start this wasn't the perspective? Go check out other reviews that are more your demographic. Since you're still here, all the flaws mentioned above still irk me as a designer, so I'd look for a more realistic racing game than this one if it weren't for my kids and split screen wasn't a factor.Get it on sale, avoid it otherwise.

												トラックマニア2シリーズ3本目のゲーム。今年の11月下旬に発売予定だった、最新作の""Turbo""が来年に延期してしまったため12月22日、今現在発売されてる中で一番新しいゲーム。環境は渓谷の""Valley""、車種はラリーカーみたいな車を運転します。ハンドル軽い。個人的に、2の中では一番運転が難しく感じる・・・。元々滑りやすい林道があり、尚且つハンドルが軽いので運転がまぁ大変（笑）			",52,4,6,6,11,0,3

												This being my first Trackmania title, I was thoroughly impressed.Pros1. Easy to learn, can take hours upon hours to become a pro2. Track Builder is my personal favorite item of this game, due to it being very well developed, and lots of funCons1. The only thing I was really dissapointed with when I got this game was the non-upgradeable or interchangeable cars, which was really my fault for not doing some more research on the game.2. Unless you love this game like no other game, it can get boring and repitiveSummary: Trackmania Valley is a fun and easy to learn driving game that comes with an excellent track builder feature.PS: I would wait for this to go on sale, I don't think it is really more of a $15 game (just my opinion).

												This game feels like the runt of the litter when it comes to the Trackmania games. The handling is strange and often too sensitive, maps are dull. Nothing really stands out.However if you are a die hard fan of the Trackmania series and have squeezed every last drop out of all the other titles then you might as well just get this to entertain you for a few more hours.I would put maybe if steam reviews allowed the option, but i cant and its not a bad game, so i'll recommend it.

												I had higher hopes for this game however it's game controller support is weak. This is not the type of game you'd enjoy playing on a keyboard. Otherwise, it's a pretty good game if yiou enjoy time trails single player. The game is definitely riding on multiplayer. For the price during the autumn sale, I cannot complain too much.

I'm a veteran in playing trackmania, I started with the first game ever: TM, next up all games in the series up untill now.TM² is a really addictive game wich offers you a lot of diversity and creativity.you can do whatever you want whenever you want, You don't ahve any obligations. if you like to build maps or to drive maps that's up to you.even for those who like to code things this game offers a whole sandbox in coding, Moviemaking, Map making, and racing, with a lot of different game modes.also this is a game with a nice competive scene, TM has always (as far as I remeber) had a competive part, it is considered as an eSport. well I hope this will convince some to play the game as pretty much of us do :)ign: lolig ",98,1,4,6,3,0,8
