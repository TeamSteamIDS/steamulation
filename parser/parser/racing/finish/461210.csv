Early Access Review
								This review will change in the future, depends on the content of the patches.Until now i cant recommend this game for anyone who wants to ""play"" it and not just test it. Its very very very rough atm, its laggy, has nearly no content and it looks ""ugly"", especially the GUI.I dont say there wont come good patches in the future and horse lovers should keep an eye open but until now its just for hardcore fans. Bought it to see if it is something for my niece but sadly no, atleast not yet.I will update that review after the next patch and write a bit more about its pros and cons.

								I really can't recommend it at this time.  None of the features are available that were in the trailers (building, etc).  It is very limited and very rough.  When the game is updated the developers do not include patch notes.  After putting some play in they put in a hotfix without logging people out so that all progress was lost and the response is ""Well that will happen, it is alpha"".  While that is true (and expected) it is also expected that developers (of even alpha early releases) will try to apply patches in a responsible way.I'll keep my eye on this title for the future and hope that it can provide features that were advertised.  Good Luck UnexEvo!  Hope it becomes a favorite title in the future!			",74,34,1,22,10,0,3

Early Access Review
								i have mixed feelings about this.. a game like this is needed.. noone makes them anymore. but there is close to nothing to do in the game other than Mining Iron or cutting down trees to be able to afford a carrot so you can tame a horse. (about 1 hours of gameplay worth) there doesent seem to be any updates atm so im not sure how fast/active the developers are. The game has Great potential. but if the developers spend too much time gettin to a playable state. i belive the game is simply gonna die and never release properly.  its a 50/50 right now.. i would want more communication and content being pushed out alittle faster.. rather have small updates ever 1-2 weeks.. than have one major every 6 months(im not giving this a thumbs down because i dont like it.. but because myt gut feeling tells me its gonna die before it releases due to the lack of communication and updates)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Note: This game is in Alpha Phase, so there is not going to be much meat for this review. I will probably do another review as more features get implemented into the game. I've heard about this game, Riding Out through YouTube, when I was looking for an Equestrian themed MMO that had more of a mature feeling to it, in a way. There is Star Stable and Alicia, although Star Stable is more aimed at a younger audience, and I would consider Alicia more of a Racing Horse MMO. When I saw clips of this game called Riding Out, I decided to check its' Facebook Page, and then made the decision to buy it (this was back in December.) I have played the game in December, when it was originally only a Single Player game. Back then, it had somewhat of a Quest System and Tutorial already implemented in the game. The Quest/Tutorial taught you how to control your character, get on a horse, mine iron, and cut wood. It was fairly easy to understand, and quick to get through. Playing the game now, I have found that they have changed the game quite a bit. There is not a clear quest system in the game as of yet. You start out spawning in Woodhill, and kind of have to figure out what to do (press F1 for keybindings.) You talk to a guy at Woodhill called Stefan by left clicking with the mouse, who directs you to go into town to find a hotel. On the way to town, you meet a guy called Karl, and talk to him. He only complains about the increase of visitors to the town, and you continue on your way. When you reach the town, you talk to the Hotel Owner, only to find out that the hotel is currently closed and under construction. Now, you're stuck in a town with no place to stay, and a little money to start off with. What do you do?Well, I went to Tool Trader to buy myself an axe, pickaxe, and a torch. From there, I went out into the world to gather wood, and iron ore. I use the iron ore to make iron ingots, and sell both the ingots and wood back to the Tool Trader to make some money. After that, I buy some carrots (carrots are 310 coins, so you better get a good amount of wood and ingots to sell) and start my adventure to look for a horse.At first, it was pretty difficult to navigate around the map, since there is no marker on the map itself to tell me where I am in the world, so I have to rely on landmarks, and memorizing the roads. I manage to find three horses so far, all static at specific locations (since they don't move, they should be easy to find if you so happen to crash, net craps out, etc.) What I also did, was look into the screenshots to see if anyone has taken any pictures of the horses. I would look closely at the picture, the environment the horse is in, and the landmarks to get a feel for the general location of the horse. When I found the particular horse I wanted to tame, all I had to do was feed it a carrot... and that was that! The horse was mine to name and keep! To take my horse out, I had to press H, and then my horse's name.Now, I have a horse, and know how to make money. Now what? Well... to be honest, there is not much else to do, other than to tame more horses and keep making money via gathering wood and iron ingots. I can see how that can be boring after a while, but hopefully the developers will add more things to do as the game progresses. The only multiplayer functionality that is available at the moment is chatting, and watching people run around, though I am sure that will change at a later date.There are plans for this game to have breeding, training, races, shows, etc. as the game develops further. Take note that the game is $19.99. If you really want to support the development of this game, I would recommend that you purchase it. From what I have seen so far, the developers seem really good at responding quickly to player comments, questions, and concerns via facebook. Hopefully their responsivness will continue to be just as active on steam, as it is on Facebook. They are also not afraid at keeping you updated on the development of the game. They will let you know of any updates coming out, and if there are any delays or hold ups (again, via Facebook.) Again, I hope that they will continue to be just as responsive on Steam to new players. If you are unsure about purchasing the game at its current state, then wait, and sit back and watch to see how the game will develop. I will give you my reason for purchasing this game back in December: I was looking for an Equestrian MMO that looked more mature in presentation, and offers the ability to train, breed, and do a lot more with horses. To me, this game shows a bit of promise in offering me what I am looking for. Maybe it's a risky chance, but I took it. Will you take that chance?			",40,2,1,5,9,0,3

Early Access Review
								It's a pity that this game is what it is right now. I know it's an early access, and I have to say this game has potential. I also like the textures, such as the horse's skin and the different types of grounds, like stone and sand. Unfortunately this game's graphics aren't really good, and I would rather prefer a smaller world for the beginning than a huge world with really slow rendering. (My PC and graphic gards are the upper class, so it's not because my PC isn't good enough or something like that.) Also the flowers, bushes and stuff like that are simple 2D sprites, and the islands are both very, very empty. I wouldn't call this game a MMORPG yet, cause there aren't any quests, or NPCs you could really talk to. Interface also doesn't look pretty, and you just can't do anything at all besides farming iron to buy carrots, to tame horses, that are very rare. (Rare if you don't want one of the thousands of grey horses). That's it. No building, no racing, no advance, no RPG. Also the camera movements are crappy, just as the reaction of player' actions (such as clicking and not reacting). Again, I know it's an early access, and I know this game is in development, but I have to say that 20,-, wich I fully paid to test that game are more than too much. I'm sorry to give all these negative comments, but I would't buy it ever again. At least not yet. Please make something outta this piece of game.Thanks for reading. :)P.S. Article was written in English to be readable for as many users as possible. My native language is german, so I'm sorry for eventually spelling and/or grammar mistakes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Man oh man, where to even begin?Let's start off by saying yeah, it's early access but come on - there are some basic things that should not have been left out - you know, like a half arsed attempt at a tutorial, or a map marker, or heck - even just giving us a pick axe for supporting this game. Come on, scratch our backs a little bit here, devs.The mechanics are annoying. If you want to run anywhere, prepare for your hand to cramp holding shift + w, because you aren't even given a horse to begin with - even though similar MMO's like Star Stable, will at least be decent and give you your first mount.I can deal with the less than mediocre graphics, I can deal with the lack of character customization at the moment, and the tackless horses and the completely unrealistic 'taming' technique, but when you won't even give people who spend money on this game half a thought at an okay start well.. pfft. I wish I'd spent my $20 elsewhere. I hope it gets better but right now folks? Save your money.			",26,3,1,4,8,1,3

								DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!It is a litteral waste of your money. The developers have officially abandoned this version of the game to make a singleplayer version of it that will be released on steam (according to themselves) but as a seperate game! This game has been abandoned, do not buy! Instead check the developers official website for updates on the singleplayer version of the game.

								I know this is still a beta, but it gives me such a hedache.Even the lowest setting is extremely laggy, and I have a decent computer. Instructions are extremely vauge, and the quests seem like a boring chore. Basically, when you start the game you are in the middle of nowhere? Besides for that, this game has been out for quite awhile and I don't see much improvement. Its a fault on my part that I bought it and I hope it will be better in the future.I will check out the game updates every few weeks to see if it has improved. If I do seem to enjoy it later on I will fix this reveiw.			",3,2,1,1,1,0,0

								Just bought this game and it's actually a huge game! That being said, so many of the features are not developed. I love it so far though and it has great potential.. Especially when the awesome developers keep us up to date! I bought this not knowing whether it would flourish, but I wanted to support this game as I was looking for a game like this for ages. They are about to add the editor and many more features and that gives me hope! Note: I am playing this game on a 2016 desktop computer (a fast one) and this game is still a little choppy. Not sure if it's because the game isn't optimized, or if it's because of computer. Just keep in mind that this is a big game and that your computer meets the requirements.			",1,0,1,0,1,0,0

								Loads of potential, and pretty fun as is provided you've got a solid gaming PC. Once they add in V-sync and detailed options the optimization problems should disappear. Has quite a bit of construction options in the build mode (you can build stuff basically anywhere in the game world), plus you can lead your horses and tie them to something so they won't run away (9 times out of 10 they will run off if you don't do this). Taming for now works the same as the old multiplayer version, feed a wild horse a carrot and you have a friend for life.The one complaint I've had for a while is not being able to see your position on the world map, you have to memorize landmarks for the time being so as not to get lost. Owned horses also aren't marked, so if one of yours runs off finding it can be interesting.Updates are pretty slow, about one a month, but they usually add quite a bit to the game. Current demo is literally the game as of this review, so you can see all there is on offer right now...but as development progresses the demo will not be updated.			",1107,304,65,107,215,17,140

Early Access Review
								Models&AnimationThe models are nice and all the joints are in the right place. I don't see a lot of clipping or stretching in the models; but the animations could use some major polishing. Pull the horse's legs in so they don't fly all over the place, straighten out the rider's jog, add in riding animations so the Player Character does more than just sit up there. Quests&ActivitiesWe could also use some gathering quests, or perhaps horse taming quests for some extra coin. Travel&NavigationIt would be nice if we could place map markers, or have the Player's location on the map. At the very least we should have a compass because it is easy to get lost. Even if we find a landmark we don't who what direction we are facing to use the map properly. So we can't locate each other. Opinions: So far this game has a lot of potintial. It looks nice, it runs well, I like it. The translations need a lot of work, but they get the point across. We could use more horse colors, for sure. And the starter horse needs to be WAY cheaper. 1000 currency for a ""Starter Horse""? No. I can buy 3 carrots and go tame my own for that price. And I have. The other problem is that the game really does not teach you how to make money. I hat to run around for over an hour before I even figured out where to buy tools. And It also took some doing to figure out that I couldn't smelt metal without a furnace. When I can create more complex things out of thin air, needing a smelter to make the base component is just weird. Suggestions: Fix up and smooth out the animations. Have a cursor sensetivity setting. Connect horse and player footfall sound effects to the animation, so they coordinate with the contact to the ground. Lower the Price of the Starter Horse.Add Quests that allow the player to earn money. Add a Compass. PLEASE. Player Sprint. Player Characters are so slow.Add horse follow. (Have the horse follow the player when summoned)Final Thoughts: I recommend supporting this game because it can do great things. Time will tell, seeing as the horse game market is so small.

								Unfortunately, we never really got to play the game. 20-30 minutes in our character glitches and froze.  30 more minutes of trouble shooting attempts and nothing. Overall, this feels much more pre-beta than beta.  It's tiring having company's upload so-called ""beta"" games, when they're far from even being beta quality, just to make an early buck. We don't mind supporting games early, but this surely wasn't worth it. We hold out hope they'll get past this and we may yet look at them again, but for now, I'd be careful with your $.
