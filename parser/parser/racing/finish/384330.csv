												It is what the game claims to be but better. It has this awesome PSX/N64 type low-polygonal graphics. Because of that this is a great game for computers that have low-specs AKA toaster computers and just looks super nice and clean. Of course, the thing that attracted me the most is that this game has procedural generated race tracks. Of course this means infinite replay value. The sense of speed that I personally experienced was a mixture of various racing games.. The ones that come to mind would be the Wipeout series, Ridge Racer and surprisingly enough Star Wars Pod Racing. 8/10 I recommend this game for a racing fix and the developers did justice.

												This is Race the Sun meets Super Meatboy meets early F-Zero.You got procedural tracks (run until time runs out, run forever, etc), premade mission tracks, seeded tracks (like binding of isaac seed mazes) and race of the day in 3 environments, woods, winter and desert and a bunch of difficulties.As in meatboy, to get the best times you must pretty much be boosting all the time, otherwise you wont even get 2 stars and therefore won't advance missions and unlock♥♥♥♥♥♥ The vehicle autoaccelerates and you can turn, brake, and boost. There's no airbrakes like in Wipeout/F-Zero but braking obviously makes you turn better. 4 vehicles, with different speeds/handling/collision tolerance and delay.Very basic graphics with a tad of cell shading.Can be very hard if you want the best times.This thing can run on a toaster.

												This game rocks!!!  The controls are very basic, someone that's not good at games will be able to learn how to play within a minute or two using the arrow keys and spacebar.  It's great because if you want to sink sometime into this game and play the missions, you can do that, or you can just try and set the record on the leaderboards for the race of the day.  Most race's only take 3-5 minutes to complete.  Its a great game if you need a quick game fix also.  Polyrace has a look that is both futuristic and retro at the sametime.  Hit the boost button to haul♥♥♥♥♥ just try not to smash into anywalls.  I highly recommend it to people of all ages and I think the more people on the leaderboards the better.  Are you the fastest racer in the world?  With these very basic controls, you might be the fastest, all you have to do is try. 10/10			",158,55,4,20,19,1,18

												Procedural generation often brings practically endless replayability to a game while focusing on quantity over the quality of immaculate, tight design. That is somewhat the case with PolyRace, that rather than having a handful of tracks to choose from, opts to generate tracks procedurally giving the player some 45 million tracks to choose from. That is not to say that there isn't quality to be found, the game can be really entertaining for a certain type of gamer.Despite the amount of tracks technically available, the game is slightly barren on content. There's the Training mode, where the player can generate tracks using a short string of letters and numbers, choose a hovercraft and race until their heart's content. There's the Mission mode, where there are 20 pre-chosen tracks available, ranging from Easy to Extreme in difficulty. From each Mission a maximum of five stars can be earned with a good enough result. Stars unlock new Missions, new hovercraft and colors to use with them. The two hardest difficulties can be quite challenging and take a relatively lot of time to clear with five stars. As far as strictly single-player content goes, that's it.Then there's the Challenge mode, where after generating a track, the player is given 10 minutes to race on it and put up their best time. After that the Challenge is published and other players can take a crack at it, also for 10 minutes. Finally, there's the Race of the Day. As can be surmised, it's a generated track that's available for 24 hours for anybody to race on. The multiplayer is asynchronous, so the player never races against someone else directly. Instead, races take place against ghosts, either another player's, the developer's, or the player's own previous best run.These four game modes are all the game has to offer. It's a bit spartan, but considering the game is so focused on improving one's results in short courses, it's appropiate. Combined with the amount of tracks, it's all that's needed.The tracks themselves are short, only around 20-40 seconds. And they aren't tracks in the traditional racing game sense, rather, they are open areas filled with destructible and non-destructible hazards. There are two main race types, Time Attack and Distance. In the former the goal is simply to reach the finish line in the shortest time possibly, in the latter the aim is to simply get as far as possible until the time runs out, while collecting orbs that add to the timer. In Training mode there's also Endless, where the player can race in a randomly generated world until they crash or get bored. The player is guided by a string of lights that leads towards the finish line or the next time-extending orb. But the guiding lights are not strict instructions, they are more like suggestions. If there's a faster path towards the destination, it's up to the player to find it and be good enough to dodge the hazards that may be there. This makes shortcuts feel incredibly dynamic and fresh and not just something the developer came up with.Overall, the game is fairly simple. There's very little to unlock, there's no improving your craft's stats, no story. And the game's all the better for it. This is strictly a game meant for the type of gamer who can race on a short ~30-second course again and again and again and again until they get it just right, and actually enjoy the experience. If the gamer has likeminded individuals to share their times and favorite courses with, all the better.			",296,41,57,22,23,0,53

												Great racing game with very precise controls and an incredible sense of speed!Check out the good demo, it will definitely tell you if the game is something for you and it's even a very small download. Try it with a gamepad if you can, I think it's more fun that way and you'll most likely be faster. Also, don't forget to use the booster. The hovercraft is accelerating automatically but it's not going fast. (That might not be obvious if you just start playing without checking the controls.)Be aware that there's (currently) no circuit tracks and no synchronous multiplayer. It's all done in the form of time/distance trials against the ghosts of other players or your own. It would probably be almost impossible to race directly against another player on the short rally-like tracks with their really tight sections, shortcuts and obstacles at this speed anyway. But don't get me wrong, the track design is one of the best things about the game and really makes it unique in my opinion.MISSIONSFixed tracks that ramp up in difficulty, with a mix of time and distance races. Getting 5 stars on all of them is not that easy, even for more experienced racers. A recent patch also added player leaderboards for every mission!CHALLENGESEvery player can create challenges, which means that the game creates a random track (with selectable region/difficulty/hovercraft/race type) and you have 10 minutes to do your best. You can then choose to share it so every other player can try (once) to win the challenge by beating your best within 10 minutes.RACE OF THE DAYA new random track with a leaderboard every day. This is amazing! I think it just needs more players to really shine.Generally the only problem I see with the game is a lack of players at the moment. So give it a try and spread the word if you like it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very fun and polished little racing game. The price point may be a bit high for what the game offers (there aren't a ton of modes to play with and only 20 ""missions""), but it's not too expensive. The only real complaints I have at this time are the time it takes to restart between rounds gets a bit annoying, the post-game screen is a little hard to understand, and the poor grammar in the menu text. Small imperfections on an otherwise great game though.Edit: Binary Dream made a nice update to reduce the time it takes to restart between tries. Good stuff.			",199,46,8,27,14,3,20

Disclosure: Download code received from developer.PolyRace is a straight-forward, time trial-oriented racer with a low-poly art style and '80s synthpop soundtrack. Core gameplay is based around navigating open terrain at high speed, avoiding obstacles and sticking to a recommended path. Areas are all wilderness-based, featuring arid, forest and snowy settings. Players can play through missions with different objectives to unlock more vehicles and courses, or try their hand at a ""Race of the Day"" challenge based around a competitive leaderboard. Custom events are also available, but only one ship and course are available upon first starting the game.SYSTEMS:Tight, responsive, and simple controls that don't get in the way.Open courses; the basic path is laid out through the courses, but it's up to you to decide what the fastest route is.Short race times; easy to get a handful of races in when you're pressed for time.Difficulty is moderate from the start and increases quickly. Challenges have reasonable base targets, and five-star scores encourage retries to perfect course runs. Players with dull reflexes will have a hard time.AESTHETICS:Low-poly graphical style is simple and easy on the eyes. Helps keep things clear at high speeds, but players used to flashier games may be left wanting.Variety in environments is nice, though one or two more variations would be welcome.Sound is spartan, balanced more towards the music. A good thing, as the soundtrack fits the action well.Menus and HUD are functional, the latter position just well enough to keep out of the way. Menus could use a bit of sprucing up. Making the course markers visible through blind crests and obstacles is also a good choice.Overall, decent little game! If you're used to flashier packages, you might be disappointed, but if a super-fast, bite-sized racer sounds up your alley, it's worth a look.			",335,27,14,13,9,0,20

												PolyRace is a very addicting hovercraft racing game with procedural generated tracks.the game offers a training, mission, challenge and race-of-the-day mode.opponents are represented in form of ghost pilots of other players, which replaces a realtime multiplayer mode.the controls are very direct and precise.i didn't try a analog input device yet, but i was able to reach the top5 in some race-of-the-day events by use of keyboard controls.

												DAILY COMPETITIVE CHALLENGE  w/leaderboards!YOU WANT TO BE THE FASTEST IN THE WORLD (global leaderboards)?BE THE FASTEST IN THE RACE OF THE DAY (RTD), AND BE ETERNALIZED FOR ALL TO SEE.MISSION modes to unlock more hovers for challenges, might be able to choose yours in RTD *fingers crossed* ""no leaderboards on there just yet but hopefully in the future.""CHALLENGE mode progress is KEPT FOREVER so do your best.But, seriously the meat and potatoes for me is the RTD mode.  It's a random track every day resets around 8pm EST. I've reached #1 nine times in there and for 30 second tracks it sure does take a long time.  And I wouldn't have it any other way. Learning shortcuts, finding a better racing line and learning from ghosts.The controls are tight brakes are barely needed so slam on that boost you earn every second so watch that stick wiggle gamepadders.  If you want an engaging racing game, that offers a daily dose of competitive gameplay look no further. ",355,39,10,34,30,1,33

												Really cool pure racing game. Responsive and simple controls, and they need to be as you need fast reactions to navigate the courses.The procedurally generated courses are nice and the polygonal graphics are pretty stylish imo.The ability to challenge other players on courses you generate is good. The only problem might be getting enough people to use that feature and enough of a Polyracer community in general.Apart from the content already in the game I'm not sure where it might go in the future or if it will see future updates.Anyway it's a great little game and I'm enjoying the challenges so far (and failing to beat that guy Joker :-)			",66,6,8,6,6,1,2

												Doesn't meet its potential yet, but it sure as hell has it. It plays to the same rhythm as games like Super Meatboy and Hotline Miami in that levels are short but difficult, prompting you to try again and again. This formula is usually fun and addicting, but PolyRace just hasn't found that flow yet. Restarting a race is sluggish, and crashing comes often. Zooming around is SO satisfying, that it's a bit of a bummer to encounter so many walls hidden around corners and behind hills ready to throw menus at you after a lackluster crash. Not a lot of content here eitherI want to recommend this PolyRace, but there isn't much under the hood and lacks polish.			",122,38,1,15,9,3,10

												I like speed. I don't, of course, mean methamphetamine. And I'm not referring to the movie with Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock (in this instance. )  I like the sort of speed that makes you go ""AAARGH"" at your monitor; the kind of speed that the term ""breakneck"" was originally coined for, where you think ""oh look, a wall"" and you hit it before you've even finished thinking the word ""oh"". This game has that in spades. It also manages to get from me something that I thought I'd left behind; that ""just one more go"" mentality that seems to wipe hours off my day. I used to love the Wipeout series; it seemed to be built around the same thing that I love, albeit with a nice gentle learning curve that eventually ramped you up to the aforementioned ""AAARGH"" level. The thrill (to someone like me) of negotiating a particularly difficult stratch of corners without coming into contact with anything can't be overstated. Polyrace has also apparently been built with these things in mind, although the inclusion of procedurally generated tracks adds a nice ""exploration"" vibe to it; I've thought a few times now that I've refined my racing lines through a level down to near perfection - only to see on the leaderboard that I'm still 5-10 secs off the pace, then watching the ghost of my self appointed nemesis (more on them in a mo) skate through a gap I'd never even seen before. There are currently only 3 game modes available, to my knowledge - it claims to have 4 but I've yet to get the ""Challenge"" option working at all (that or nobody has created any tracks yet, which I'd be surprised by.) Training is more ""free run"" than any kind of actual training and Missions are pre-generated maps created by the developers in which you can unlock new colours and ships. The real fun at the mo is to be had""Race of the Day"" where you attempt to beat the ghosts of other players (and they can teach you a thing or two about how to thread through tiny gaps at over 600km/h, I can tell you; I feel like I'd give Luke Skywalker a run for his money after today's track.) And I have been known to roar in triumph at my screen when I've finally put my nemesis's time down (getting to them!), There appears to be a quite a small player base at the moment, and I don't understand that - I've just picked this game up for a tiny amount of money and I can't recommend it enough. If you've bothered to read this far, then you must already be interested. My advice would be to stop dithering and by the blimmin thing. Honestly, if it takes you this long to make a choice of left or right round a rock in Polyrace, you'll already be wearing your ship's♥♥♥♥♥♥as a hat - and subsequently reaching for the restart button for ""just one more go"". Oh, my nemesis? His or her handle is Joker. And I'm coming for them. (In a friendly, competitive and totally non-confrontational way, of course.)TLDR; It's fast, cheap and awesome. Buy it. Just be prepared to swear at it and be all twitchy by the time you put it down again ;)			",235,27,13,26,12,2,23
