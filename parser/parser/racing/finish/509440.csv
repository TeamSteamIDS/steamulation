												I did not feel like I had godlike powers. That alone should tell you how well it was simulated- poorly.			",74,2,0,4,3,0,2

												Soooo.... Looked like a fun little sim.Nope.Just spam click the elements buttons for points to spend on upgrades. When they all get to 10 and you have all the animals, there is NOTHING else to do. Played through twice, each time lasted around 4 minutes with the same outcome on each play through.This game is terrible.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!			",84,8,1,12,9,0,9

												I wanted to get this game to give it a quick review seeing as no one else (in my language) has.Alright, God Simulator everyone.Its exactly how it looks and sounds from the video.  you select 3 out of 4 options of what you want your world to be made out of. Trees, mountains, lakes, and rocks.  Once thats done you choose... animals and events? to happen. Theres also a SCORE counter at the bottem left.  The tutorial of the game tells you basic camra controls and nothing of the game itself. When you start a game your told what to do, but even that is extreamly vague.  The FONT for the 'events' sandstorm (not dust storm as it says in its desc) rain, big rain, and fog and something else, is Horrible. The UI is garbage.One little thing that upset me is the game is based around humans, fair enough, but when Humans are summoned a 'food and happiness' shows up on the top upper left. The happiness is represented by =) face, while hunger is represented by a crudely drawn image of Pizza.    Yep.			",122,27,2,22,29,2,14

												Game I assume is very early in development;1. No Save Option2. Game has no overall objective3. Using weather buttons really has no affect overall but getting you free points4. Quite limited world size5. Animal and people dont do anything but move around6. The 'General Improvements' end at 5 and thats where the game sort of ends7. Eventually game turns to nothign except for spaming the wather buttonsI hope to see future updates has the game has a good concept but im leaving a thumbs down as no where does the game say that this is early acess or early release.Also would like to add howcome the picture of this game on the store page has very further development is this not released to us?

												Theres not much to say about this game.Its a small, unfinished-looking, wierd game. If the creator put a little more effort into creating a game, this actually could become something.I'm sure I speak for everyone when I say: NO MUSIC. At least let us have a way to turn it off.Make the fonts you use consistent. Don't use 5 different fonts for just 3 menus, make them all the same font.Some of the scrolling speed is ABYSMALLY slow.Try and use some better English in the descriptions and such.Developer, if you really want to make a well designed, fully functional God Simulator, then don't use Unity.And the worst thing is: Theres nothing to do. After creating man, theres not much to do beyond managing them.Put in a bit of effort, and some dedication, and this could be an OK game. but as it stands, I would not reccomend this game to others. Sorry.3/10			",76,4,1,6,9,0,2

												I liked the simplicity of the game, the graphics are cute, the downside to the game is that its very short so im hoping they will release a patch soon			",60,6,0,5,5,0,1

												ive played this game cause it looks like a fun game but no i played through the game and i really think this game has potential to be a good game but if you keep working on this game you will loose the thumbs downs but this game seems to be fun if it had more detail.it took me about 5 minutes to figure out what to do.the music was annoying because everyone uses that song.thanks for reading.
