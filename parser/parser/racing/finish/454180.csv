+ Interesting level Design+ Good soundtrack+ A fun concept although the driving mechanics need some improvementThis game is in Early Access, so don't take these too seriously- Awful car control in every aspect, slight turns cause you to spin out, breaking causes you to slide forward or off the edge, reversing takes ages to turn around, small jumps may cause you to lose all control and roll.- Repetitive / Grindy, you will mainly be grinding for credits to buy upgrades without making much progress- Due to the poor car mechanics the game is overly challenging to the point where it's more frusterating than fun.- No Controller SupportIn its current state I can not recommend this game, although it does have potential to improve.

Early Access Review
								This game is not what it advertises. Controls are very hard to mantain and it doesn't hardly tell you how any aspect of this game works. The tutorial Completely disappeared when i tried to do it too. just to get to the next level you have to play the first level over and over. Which isn't necessarily bad, if the controls worked better and the level was built better than they are. The levels have almost no room for error, and when you add in the controls, instead of going fast and making the game seem really cool like the trailers, you have to be careful which way you turn and hope to god that alien spaceship (Or whatever it is) doesn't shoot you off the track.

												What a bad game. A decent prototype, but not worth a buy or recommendation.A sandbox with barely any content. All you can do is drive along a crazy floating road with obstacles and collect fuel canisters to get coins, which you use to upgrade your car, unlock another car or the second level.+ Good music- Only two levels, of which the second has to be grinded for with points- Awful tutorial with no checkpoints, missing information, and unreasonably hard track- Bad menu design (element positioning, only mouse usable)- No game goal; all you do is drive and grind ""coins""- Bad car handling, and upon upgrading gets even worse (with delayed steering)- Pretty bad level design- No consistent game world (you collect fuel containers but get ""coins"". Destroyable walls but street lights at the side are indestructible)			",1067,396,34,97,96,8,126

												I just had to get a refund on this game even though I tend to like these kinds of games and there are some easy achievements to get. I just couldn't stand the controls anymore especially the jumping aspects. It became too frustrating. By all means try it though with Steam's refund policy. It only took me 20 minutes to realise it was no good for me. I could definitely see myself buying again if they updated the controls.			",2566,1141,87,259,284,28,345

												The concept of the game is interesting. It's a car based 3D platformer. It could be funny if your car have a minimum of credible physics, and responsive controls. I played through the first level only, why I can't play more ? Because I've some TrackMania tittles in my library. It's not so different and TrackMania is fast, easy to drive, fast, fun, fast, community based, fast, beautiful and fast. Keep away of CrazyCars, and get TrackMania² before the end of summer sale!

												Update: Dev fixed the issues with the graphics settings. Thanks mate :)I wouldn't say I was too disappointed by this as it was very cheap and looked equally so, but I was disappointed at the lack of content.The cars handle pretty averagely and the physics are difficult to master, but the tracks, of which there are two, are rather interesting. The Ice Level is really difficult because the surface is as lumpy as it looks and you really would need a 4x4 to manage a track like that.To me, this isn't a finished game. If it was in early access I would understand, but this is being sold as a completed game. Two tracks, three cars; just not enough to keep me interested. It's nice that the tracks have multiple paths, but all the paths are the same terrain with just different obstacles.This is not a complete package. You get some meager scraps of content in a physics engine. I had a bit of fun and frustration with it, but it's just not worth the money as it is. Add more content please.

												I know its cheap, but it looked like fun to zip around a course, hitting power ups and trying to stay on the track.  However, it just felt sluggish, controls weren't great, and I got a headache.  I suspect it gets better as you unlock better cars that probably give you better control & speed.  But I woud fall off the track when I didn't feel I had sufficient control, and didn't really care much to continue.  (2/5 stars, buy it for trading cards).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								CrazyCars3D is a good game that is both challenging and fun at the same time although the steering could be made a little bit easier. You'll have a much harder time steering your car than what the trailer makes out. Your goal for this game is very simple, collect fuel can kind of things to earn credits and then use them credits to either upgrade your car or if you have the time to earn 100,000 credits you can unlock a new map to drive around on.  My overall opinion is this game is good to play to kill time but that's it as there's no real goal to it. Just drive around, fall off the side of the map and respawn.7/10 would spin out again			",88,5,1,2,7,3,1

It's not fun. however overall the game is pretty entertaining, and the soundtrack is really good. My only real complaint besides the janky platforming is the lack of traction. I honestly think this game is being played 100% on blck ice coated with oil. 7/10 especially with the cheap price. it will entertain you for awhile.			",43,8,0,16,15,1,8

								CrazyCars3D is both challenging and fun. While it may still be early in development and seem to not have many features, the game is ridiculously challenging but fun at the same time. It's one of the only games that I have found where I actually enjoy making mistakes just to see what happens as a result. While I did get frustrated a few times, something about the game makes you want to keep trying to see what lies ahead. For the price of the game, definitely give it a shot just to have a little fun.

												I don't understand the hate. Probably the usual whiny PC master-race folks who blame losing every video game on ""artificial difficulty."" The game works great for me even with an Xbox 360 controller using the Linux version and it reminds me quite a bit of Gripshift on PSP with controls that feel like a mix between Twisted Metal and Crazy Taxi 2. I got this game on sale for dirt cheap and it was a good deal, and fun mutli-player. I'd say you won't be disappointed but if you're a whiner who cant play a classical styled game with puzzles, pitfalls and limited lives then don't buy it (go buy Undertale instead dweeb).

								This is an oddly addictive, and very tough, little platformer. I really like it. I expected to spend about 30 seconds with it but I've put in half an hour so far and I will definitely be playing it again. Don't let the slightly shonky graphics put you off, it's charming in its own way, and actually reminds me of the likes of Crazy Taxi in its presentation. Well worth the £1.49 I spent on it.Here's my first impressions:
