*Note* I played with a controller & monitor+ Supports a variety of devices. HTC Vive, Occulus Rift, Gamepads, Steering Wheels, etc.  I believe the game is intended to be played in VR, but I found it enjoyable without as well. ( I'm glad the developers decided to support both )+ The gameplay is pretty enjoyable. You are out in the middle of the ocean and complete a variety of off-road obstacle course type challenges using Jeeps and Trucks.  The main goal is to get to the flag without falling off or destroying your vehicle.+ Great destruction and deformation physics. I loved seeing wheels and doors come off or the truck getting crumpled when you flip over. + Visually the game is beautiful with great lighting, and gorgeous looking water and sunsets. This game is in early access so these are subject to chane- The camera moves on it's own, and can be incredibly irrating when it decides to randomly change angles and plunge underwater or behind a rock obstructing your view causing you to drive off an edge.  ( This may only be when using a controller )~ Needs some sort of V-Sync option. Was hard to record this game as it is a bit demanding on CPU with unlocked framerates.			",2904,1026,99,265,347,21,392

								Just played 95 minutes!This is so awesome. I played with the Vive and everything works great even steering with the contollers, which I thought was going to be hard. Made it through all 40 levels and can't wait to go back in with the new rig I just got. Things that make this fun;offroading, crawling, jumping, bouncing around, finding different lines, crashing, damage, upgrades, seaguls flying into you and dying, spinning tires,  different camera angles with drag cam and 3rd and 1st person view, quick loading times, great graphics, easy to pick up and play, I could go on  and on.Now I just need to figure out how I can use my vive and steering wheel!

								I love it.  It's like having a big R/C car right in front of you that is slightly heavier and floatier.  (really depends on the vehicle, they're all different.)  I went from the first Jeep to a Range Rover and the difference in weight was night and day.It also has 2-player Local Multiplayer.  One gets VR, other gets the screen.  You both race at the same time.There's some ""Arena mode"" that says, ""Coming Soon"".  I imagine it being some kind of destruction derby because the damage models are amazing!  It's almost like BEAM NG or something.  I mean, you can pancake these things and have the doors and wheels fly off.I can hold the left grip (VIVE) and move the whole map to whatever perspective I need it to be.  I like to drag the water right up to my nose. If you've ever played Tilt Brush.  You hold grips in both hands and expand them.  And everything becomes MASSIVE.  I WISH I could make the truck lifesize.  It would be g*ddamn amazing.  (UPDATE:  Vehicles are massive now!)Tons of unlocks, tire sizes, steering wheels, suspension, engines.  I'm pretty sure they're going to add tuning.  150 tracks.  Create your own tracks.I definitely recommend this for anyone who likes TRIALS, R/C and/or anything Offroad.OR if you like Bigmouth Bass swimming around your feet!			",496,57,29,12,62,8,30

								In it's current state the game is playable and fairly entertaining.  However, there is still a lot of work to do before calling this rock crawling ""simulator' a finished product.   My video on it - caution - lots of swearingThe first true annoyance is the vehicle audio.  It's awful, simply awful.  It's super loud, sounds like the recording mic was directly in the engine bay of a semi-truck.  It sounds nothing like what you'd expect from whatever vehicle you're using in game.The very next, second, annoyance you'll find is with the camera.  I swear the camera in ""orbit"" mode is literally trying to get you killed.  It's actually worse than the obit cam from BeamNG, which is saying a lot.Physics model seems ok.  However, the suspension set up, amount of grip, and power are completely out of wack.  The suspension is way too stiff.  Vehicles bounce all over the place because of this.  Tire grip is greatly exaggerated, so much so that you can actually flip the vehicle back on it's wheels in some roll-over situations.  Lastly, now I don't think I've ever said this before, but the power these vehicles put to the wheels is just way too much.  290hp, sure, but the vehicles all feel like they're pushing well over 1000 ft lbs of tourqe,  Wheelies are cool on a strip of pavement, but not when you're precariously positioned on a rock.Game crashes occasionally.The game has tons of potential, though, don't get me wrong.  It's fun, too.  But I just can't recommend the game in it's current state for $11 cdn. ",91,19,11,10,15,3,15

								EDIT: I'm updating my review after ending the actual levels avaliable (39), I spent more than 3 hours to finish it (and without 100% of totems) but new levels are planned as well as other modes and an editor. I confirm my very positive opinion on the game, it's one of my favourite of +120 SteamVR apps of my list and shows how well it works a third person view in VR, it's basically like to pilot a real RC car.---This is a real suprise. Not only it's the best third person graphics I've seen in VR, as car looks so real you can touch them like real RC models, but the wrist associated to the sterring wheel and analog triggers to speed it's just a perfect inteface for this game. I was skeptical before, owning a driving set, but I was wrong.Off-Road Paradise is in the kind of trial games, with realistic physics and extreme tracks to beat. Could be played in first person, but it's a nonsense (and also extremely sicknening, the game warn you if you're very sure about use this) because it's a perfect game to be played in a god view. It could be played sitting, or much better standing and maybe in full roomscale, so you can walk around your environment. You could also put your head under water to see fishes, super nice :) Lot of game modes, not all avaliable now, including a nice multiplayer headset vs monitor.Among a VR market with games all similiar more or less, Off Road Paradise real shine. More third person stuff please!			",133,49,10,4,27,5,10

												I liked this game. I love my Jeep and  I love driving it on trails so naturally this game drew me in. I have played spintires and once this game works out a few physics issues I would say it is as good at capturing the offroad experiece as spintires. Spintires never really gave you the opportunity to do any real crawling and this game does.Here's my main issue. The vehicles are far too bouncy. I wish there was a way to air down the tires or fine tune the suspension set up because you drive over a wooden bridge with any form of speed and your vehicle is bouncing off the trail. It's almost like the vehicle has no weight. When you go over a crack you bounce out instead of the tire going down in and requiring a bit of work to get out. When you approach a rock instead of hitting it nice and slow and crawling over it you bounce and bounce and hope you dont bounce off the trail. The tires are another issue. I want to be able to lower my tire pressure to increase my grip on the rocks. These over inflated tires are like riding on balloons. They're jsut too bouncy! They also do not grip like real tires do. It's too easy to slide on obstacles that wouldn't slide on in real life.Overall I really enjoy the game and will continue to play it despite my issues because it is fun and you can just group the bounce issues into part of the challenge. But at the end of the day, I would like it to feel a lot more real so I can experience the challenge of crawling when I can't take my own Jeep out on the trails.			",57,5,2,7,4,0,9

												This game is very well done, if you liked games like ""trials"", ""Pumped BMX"" and ""Spintires"" then this is a must buy, its a bit pricey but does have 150 levels, and some are very hard. Shame about no online multiplayer only Local LAN, but i guess u can just use a online lan app so you can do it with mates. It also has community maps which is also a bonus. Solid game. Also there is a demo goes for about 9 levels, when i purchased full game it brang my save game over also.			",141,17,16,3,16,4,14

								Played with a steam controller on a monitor....Off-roading is an exercise in subtlety, patience, and finesse.  This game has NONE of those things.  The throttle is binary, meaning you're either sitting still or rocketing forward at a speed that won't allow you to do anything except hang on for dear life.  Even with the Steam Controller, barely applying throttle, the vehicle wants to shoot forward like you're flooring it in a McLaren F1 car.  Don't buy this.  Just don't.  Spintires is a MUCH better off-roader if that's what you're looking for.  And if you want VR toys, I'm sure there are much better examples of those out there too.			",213,58,22,38,67,1,39

								Great game. Latest update improves the cockpit experience greatly. Responsive Devs who squash bugs and deploy improvements quickly.  Can be controlled via G27 wheel and pedals adding to the fun.  New camera system system that allows for quick camera changes when needed.  For me, once I get the lay of the map, i jump in the drivers seat for a real challenge.  The new mirrors also help with spacial awareness without having to toggle an external view.The game and studio deserves your VR support.			",350,83,49,15,63,10,30

								Early access review. I hope there will be open terrain driving and courses: I really enjoyed that aspect of Screamer 4x4. Right now the game is like minigolf on wheels.It's beautiful, but on keyboard controls the accelerator is touchy and there are no gears; so the vehicle bounces around. It's a matter of haphazard bouncing to the goals.For now I'm stuck on level 15. I'll come back later, maybe I'll have acquired some twitchy skills in my sleep. Would-be drivers should wait and see what comes later.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I would like to add an edit, as of update 11 the in game damping and the weighting of vehicles has been much improved!  there still feels to be a degree of moon gravity going on at times with some of the reactions that the vehicles give but both driving precision and the consistency of the handling have both increased, a real step in the right direction! some of the newer levels are also a fantastic improvement, really rewarding careful and precise control in general while adding extra challenge if you pursue the totems!   Big thanks to the dev team for taking the communities suggestions on board.I have played for just over an hour so far, using a controller and monitor, the graphics are good and on my system with a little over the minimum requirements will run smoothly on max settings.  The recommended settings may be more of a guide for VR use.The core idea of the game is solid, and seems to play its best when aiming for the motor trials ideal.  The levels that task you with difficult turns or routes over complicated terrain I have found the most enjoyable, allowing the player to have a chance to get to grips with the vehicles and the games use of physics.  Unfortunately often the game faces you with levels that amount to no more than target shooting, firing the trucks at a part of the level geometry in the hope of landing somewhere near the finish.  In these cases the game can be frustrating and tedious, the bouncy, poorly damped nature of most vehicles handling combines poorly with the feel of low gravity that the game gives off in most levels, let alone the actual low gravity space based ones.The music in the levels quickly grates and the vehicle sound effects are poor, there also appears to be issues with sound volume and camera position, meaning that quite often on the jumping levels you launch the truck into a distant rock to hear no sound from its collision with the ground, only for the camera and noise to catch up as the wreckage rolls into the sea.I can see the core of a good, maybe even great, game here, but I feel the developers should look at spliting up the more technical levels from the zany and crazy ones and perhaps open the levels out in physical width, allowing for a more natural playstyle that gives the player a chance to devise routes and learn how to make the most of the game engine.  weighting the trucks in a more realistic way, modifying in game grip to give more actual usable power to the ground to better represent traction but at the same time reducing the trucks tendency to back or front flip would also improve the feel of the game.  The new 3rd person camera is a fantastic improvement, but I feel adding pitch adjustment would also help greatly, in a game focussing on careful movement through difficult terrain having a very adjustable and mobile camera will help the player in the long run.  I am happy with my purchase of the game, I understand its position as early access and am happy to see frequent updates from the developers and I am also interested to see what the community can produce with the in game editor, it is the next element of the game I am interested in trying.Do I recommend this game?  at this time I think yes, I hope for good things in the future and am encouraged by the updates being produced.  Others may find more value when it is picked up on a sale but I have enjoyed my playtime overall.			",120,36,4,20,9,2,6

								This is by all accounts a great game. I really enjoyed it the few times I was able to finish levels. I enjoyed it enough to restart dozens and dozens and dozens of times after rolling my 4X4 into the ocean. Is this the Dark Souls of jeeping simulators? Where are the mudd pits, sand dunes, dirt paths lined with evergreen trees? Nope, just rocks and wooden structures in the middle of the ocean. I'm a sucker for physics puzzlers and I love off-road games so this really hooked me anyways. Controls seemed pretty good, lots different camera perspectives, really takes advantage of room-scale virtual reality if you play on the HTV Vive. I must admit though, the isolation and impossibility of the situations made me feel a bit like I was role playing a 4X4 enthusiast's version of purgatory.Nice work!			",154,32,4,6,27,4,6

								First off, I'm playing on the HTC Vive.Now to the review... It's a tough call. Because of the cheap price point and the early stages of development, I give it a pass. It's rough for sure. The physics aren't quite right. The controls are a bit weird. The camera control is annoying. Graphics leave a bit to be desired. Had it crash on me multiple times. Yet, all of that withstanding, it's just FUN. It's a simple challenge and it's entertaining. I want more things like this for the Vive.As long as some of those complaints improve and the game doesn't get any worse, my review will remain positive.			",176,43,8,19,48,2,35

			Lets play Off-Road Paradise: Trial 4x4 in VR on the HTC Vive! In this gameplay we are driving four-wheel-drive trucks through various cool and tricky tracks that requires lots of skills to complete -...		

Off-Road Paradise is one of the most beautiful games ive played in VR so far. Graphics and environment are simply amazing! Steering controls fits the Vive controllers perfectly and the ability to play this game in both 1st person and 3rd person view is just awesome as both modes really works perfect in VR!Soundtrack as well as the game sounds are really nice.This game has from start more than 50 levels and many different cars - I bet it contains 10+ hours of gameplay as you have a lot of bonuses and gadgets to unlock, and there is also a local Multiplayer mode available. Soon there will also be a Track editor/creatot that will add even more value to this great game.Well, i think my video says it all - I really recommend this game to every Vive and Oculus gamer. For the low pricetag you get so much of gameplay and fun. Just get it, you will love it!Cheers SweViver			",87,20,3,0,21,6,1

								Off-Road Paradise: Trial 4X4:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ One of the greatest inventions of the 19th Century is without a doubt the automobile. Some are built to look good but surprisingly are lemons; some are built to go fast, but these days unless you are a professional racing driver you are pretty much going to do 110 KM/H at best on a motorway (Down Under, that is). However, some are built for discovering and passing the most difficult terrains. They are Off-Road vehicles. . . Oh, what about Off-Road in Paradise; let’s give it a trial! Off-Road Paradise: Trial 4X4 is a car simulation where you have to successfully navigate your 4X4 vehicle to the checkered flag.One aspect of this game I really liked straight away is the fact that you can choose to play it either as a VR experience or with your gamepad and current monitor. This way you get the best of both worlds! At first, you will reach the main menu.  Here you can select to play in one of a few different modes: in the main game, consisting of 150 levels; on local multiplayer, where one person uses the VR setup and the other one uses the monitor; or as two players using the same PC. A level editor will be coming soon as well as an arena mode.Let’s write about the scenery . . . you are in the middle of the ocean, with the sound of the waves crashing on the rocks and the birds flying by dropping free gifts as they pass through (just kidding)! The gameplay is splendid. It consists of short levels where you have to successfully reach the checkered flag. In terms of the terrain, you will be driving on rocks in the middle of the ocean with additional obstacles in your way, such as logs, wooden boats and more. In each level, you can collect a totem which will allow you to unlock new cars, paint, engines, tyres and steering wheels. I used the HTC VIVE and I must admit it was fun to use the right controller to steer the car. You will have plenty of options in regards to the camera angles, and depending on some levels, you will need to swap from one angle to another to clear the stage.Graphically the game looks great and the soundtrack is fabulous too. Control-wise, I used a gamepad and the HTC controllers and I must admit I am very surprised at how responsive the controls are. You can use a steering wheel if you own one.Positives:~~~~~~~  -	Great Graphics-	150 Levels to clear (40 in Early Access)-	Compatible with HTC Vive, Oculus and monitors-	Trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~  -	Can bit frustrating at timesOff-Road Paradise: Trial 4X4 has short, entertaining progressive difficulty level. Just well done!7/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

												Wow, this game. I played the demo, that was rather cool, but once you progress past the first 10 or so levels the game gets ridiculous. The ""physics"" engine ist just a random piece of garbage. Apparently trying to slowly drive down a gentle slope breaks your wheels, accellerating slightly makes your car go wild and steering in general is just hinted at. Pair that with moronic level design (""physics"" based logs that need to be overcome, pyramid shaped ""bridges"" with no way to maneuver, daring ""loophole"" jumps that are purely luck based and even levels IN SPACE, where ""gravity"" is different, i.e. unpredictable and you have yourselves a wonderful pile of nothing. I can't recommend the game as it is. But still:Your goal is to complete each level with one of the trucks available to you (I've unlocked 3 so far: a safari type car, a small range rover and a huge pickup that was literally useless for the first 28 or so levels I've played.) Your side objective is to gather a ""totem"" (why it's a totem I have no idea), which gives you upgrades for your car...or at least I think they are upgrades, since there are no descriptions in the game whatsoever. And the camera, my god, the camera just keeps on rotating and is generally a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ It was even worse in early access, but oh my.Maybe they realized how bad their game was when they applied a 60% discount only 1 month after release already. I've requested a refund. Sorry, you've tried, but this is unplayble. And I'm not even gonna talk about the random frame drops. What your game needs:- a better, more consistent physics engine- a better steering model and more precise controls- tool tips- actual car differences other than size- better level design (heck, at one point you're literally forcing the player to drive off a cliff and hope they somehow land not in the water and intact enough that they can somehow reach the end. That's not good level design. Obstacles need to be fun, but also matter. Better luck next time.			",209,55,12,41,26,3,65
