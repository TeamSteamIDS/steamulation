												If you can ignore the ease in which your little mini motor racing car can be spun out by competitors (and the massive clusters that this causes), and if you can get over the questional physics in a(n admittedly) minority of maps, then this game is a fantastic racer.If you grab it while it's on sale for about $2.50, then the game is a fantastic addition to a gaming library.

												Mini Moto Racing EVO is a game that ought to be more fun than it is. A isometric arcade racer in the vein of Rock ‘n’ Roll Racing and Micro Machines, from the outside looking in it would appear the stars had aligned for a brilliant modern take on the genre. The art style is adorable and bursting with charm and personality, it features an absurd amount of content, and the online multiplayer and track editor are just the icing on the cake to ensure you never run out of stuff to do. What’s so terribly unfortunate though, is all these good feelings evaporate once you get behind the wheel.Mini Moto is designed to be extremely accessible, from the light as air physics to the quick and simple to navigate courses, which makes for an enjoyable first hour or so as you get your feet wet and start blowing through courses. After that point, the experience begins to sour. Races grow repetitive, often simply reversing the track or changing the lighting and camera angle slightly, and end in an extremely unsatisfying manner. Simply continuing on with them quickly becomes a grind, as you’re given such little reason to do so and the racing itself is far too shallow to sustain the game on its own.Expounding the grind is the leveling system, which I would go so far as to say fundamentally breaks the game. Every car you drive can be upgraded with cash earned from races, but instead of scaling to your car’s specs your competitors just continue to upgrade their own vehicles the more races you partake in, presumably with the expectation you’d have similar upgrades of your own. What this means is that you are either stuck putting all your cash into one car for the duration of the championship mode, removing much of the fun out of having such a variety of vehicles to choose from, or forced to grind through the same races in order to have enough to upgrade another car to switch to without having to start again at square one. It’s supremely monotonous and a poor design decision for the sort of game the developers created.Without a doubt my biggest grievance with Mini Moto though, is the astonishingly bad AI of the computer racers. They crash into each other even to their own detriment, fire nitros at the worst possible time, and in general act like an idiotic band of monkeys that somehow got ahold of dozens of vehicles. The lack of any decent reward for winning races is bad enough, but when you do so against some of the worst AI racers I’ve ever seen in a game it just becomes a chore to do so. The online MP could fix this in theory, but unless you have several friends to play with you’ll be entirely out of luck as nobody else is playing the online mode anymore.It’s really a huge shame that so many elements of EVO are a product of poor design decisions, because there are a lot of genuinely fantastic parts to it that deserve a better racing experience. The art style for the cars and tracks is fantastic, with tons of color and some great off-brand recreations of classic and novelty vehicles. The track editor is surprisingly expansive and easy to use, which could have allowed for some great user generated content if people cared enough to put the time into making something original.But regardless of its presentation or feature list, a racing game with poor racing is impossible to recommend. I put a lot of time into Mini Moto Racing EVO, more than I should have, but regardless of how long I played or what races I chose I wasn’t having fun with any of it. There’s something mind numbingly addictive about the way EVO is structured, pushing me through race after race no matter how little I got out of it, or how much I wanted to just call it quits because it was sucking me dry. I don’t want to say I hate the game, but it’s one I’m forcing myself to uninstall. It’s like a bad relationship, giving me nothing but keeping me trapped until I finally come to my senses and realize I need to get out.			",845,336,29,79,64,6,112

												Mini Motor Racing EVO is an overhead racing game that's a kin to the single screen arcade racers of the 80s. The title is apt and descriptive, because you're driving around in miniature vehicles. Its a beautiful game with a lot of diverse locales, fitting music, fun and challenge all rolled into one. Its tough to get anything more into this package, but Mini Motor goes the extra mile with a map editor and online or network multiplayer. Its also a game that uses its licenses admirably from games like Team Fortress 2, Portal 2 and to my amazement Fruit Ninja.The game has two major control schemes, both of which play excellent with a controller or keyboard and mouse. The first controller feels alien, yet its so right. Point the analog stick the way you want to go, much like non racing games. They still have a more typical control scheme of left and right to steer, but pointing the stick plays a lot better, there's no overshooting your vehicle's angle.The driving does take a bit of time to get used to. Your vehicle can turn on a dime, and often you're going so fast that you'll leave skid marks with every turn. Letting off the accelerator will put you at a dead stop almost immediately. There is no momentum in this game, unless you're pushing the gas. There's also no reverse, but that's the side effect of being able to turn your car without hitting the gas.Like the majority of racing games, you also have a nitro button and in this game, it feels a lot different. You have blocks of nitro. Press the nitro button once to use a block and this nitro cannons you forward at a reckless pace. Its total risk or reward with this nitro boost and you'll need it to overtake other vehicles that outmatch yours. Nitro canisters always appear on the track at random to give you an extra nitro block as long as you're under your maximum. You can also pick up cash on the track as well.Mini Motor Racing has three difficulty campaigns. You start on easy and then after a few cups, you'll unlock the next difficulty. These difficulties have a series of cups, each cup has four races. When you come in third place or higher of all races in the cup, it will unlock the next cup for you. Of course some cups can last twelve races, so its not limited to four. The cups transition smooth from one to the next and you can play any previous race.As for the races themselves, they're brief on closed circuit courses that are only around a minute for three or four laps. I say brief, because they're still a quick shot of fun and never overstays its welcome. The races do get longer as you proceed further into what feels like it could be a long game. At two hours in, I haven't completed all of the easy beginners championship races. You race against five other cars for most of the game, but you do start out against one, two then three competitors and so on. With more aggressive racers, it can become hazardous to even start a race. Faster vehicles can ram into you and turn you around before the first turn.The cars feel heavy, you can ram someone and push them around. While the game hardly has realistic physics, the dirty play physics are great.  Ramming someone out of your way or spinning them with such tight quarters is always a joy that other racing games have forgotten about. With the racers being mini, it becomes a feat to spin someone around rather than just pushing them. That can come back to haunt you. Any pile of cars becomes dangerous as they push right into you rather than dodge you. This is geared for the arcade, rather than realism. Its tough to avoid pile ups at the first turn.These races all have themed environments and music. Vernice city streets near waterways. A port full of shipping containers. The wilds of Africa through a river next to hippos. Racing on a Mayan temple. At a yellow sand beach across a bridge that dips into the water. Its all bright, colorful, eye catching and makes the game more fun.The soundtrack is diverse and good even if its generic, its all still fitting. Its rare, but tracks can go indoors or under bridges where the overlying areas become transparent. The developers made the game dynamic, eclectic and shows the effort put in.To get longevity out of the courses, you will be racing on a lot of the courses a few times, but with a twist. Some races reverse the track. Other events are at night, or at dusk. The largest twist when you do the same race in a different cup is a literal one. The game will shift the perspective of the track. It helps to keep things interesting on what would otherwise be the same race for the forth time. The mini map stays the same, so what is north on the mini map could be southeast on the track itself. There are a few objects to bump into on each track. You can run down cones, knock over tire stacks and it all feels good to interact and mess up the course a little.Team Fortress 2 and Portal 2 tracks are a big appeal of the game and they do make good uses of their respective franchises. You have Helen's voice in the Team Fortress 2 and the sentries voice from Portal 2. Portal 2's level has a big portal at the end to bridge a gap from the end to the finish. The Team Fortress 2 map has a lot of indoor areas and I can best describe it as the race version of Badlands. I only encountered each track once, but the Fruit Ninja track is everywhere.There is a large variety of vehicles. I keep calling them vehicles, because there are more than typical stock cars, derby cars, muscle cars and race cars, because in Mini Motor, you can drive as a police car, school bus, jeep and even an ambulance. The big buses can be dangerous with their top speed. It gives the game a lot of character and flare to be driving what you want.You'll find plenty of vehicles unlocked from the start and they're all free. The vehicles all have different skins to chose from, so you can even play as Herby the Love Bug.Each of the vehicles has their own stats for acceleration, top speed, nitro and handling. These stats can be upgraded to a certain extent by purchasing upgrades with your race winnings. The higher the tier of upgrade, the more it will cost and you'll need these upgrades to keep competing with higher levels of competition. The unfortunate part is that if you switch vehicles to one that you haven't spent thousands on upgrading, there's no way to be competitive in further races. At least you can take your cash earned from one vehicle and carry it over to a new vehicle. You can downgrade as well if you need to.Upgrading never felt like I could instantly win, it always felt like a competitive challenge. Sure there are races where some cars are just geared toward that terrain and those curves, but for the most part everything was good enjoyable, neck and neck fun once I was past the first initial races.There are quick race modes with all of the tracks you've unlocked and ones from Steam Workshop. You even have a track designer. I never expect much from a budget game's level designers, but this is easy to use and you can create something good to play in a short amount of time, albeit dull and lacking from the main game. Clicking your mouse on angles and dragging the road to make the precise curve or angle you want. Investing more time would probably yield great results if you spend the time to place props down.You can download tracks from the Steam Workshop, but what I really want is entire cups worth of tracks or the ability to make my own cups on top of tracks. A single racetrack is just too quick. Its the bread stick rather than a complete meal.Mini Motor Racing EVO is a fantastic game for a dirt cheap price. Its a game for any fan of the overhead racing genre and a fun, enjoyable experience with challenge. At $5 its tough to argue with the price for a game with so much fun and content.

												☺ Easy to play.☺ Lovely visuals.☺ Brilliantly realised Portal and Team Fortress 2 maps.☹ Unchallenging.☹ Wonky physics.☹ Drunk AI Drivers.(Note: This game was played with a controller).Mini Motor Racing EVO is a casual top down racer suitable for most ages, with easy to grasp controls and an aesthetic that greatly reminds me of playing with toy cars as a youngster.While there is a decent selection of maps (and most notably the Portal and Team Fortress 2 maps are brilliantly realised), they quickly become repetitive as you play them again and again through the championships - in forward, reverse and with the camera on a slightly different angle (which is a surprisingly clever way of making the same track play a little differently). There is also an ingame editor linked to the Steam Workshop to create, share and download other tracks which is very simple to do.While enjoyable to zip around the tracks and drift around corners, the AI opposition rarely put up any challenge at all (the exception being a couple of maps where you could do with a speed upgrade, that is easily passed the moment you have acquired it or a higher top speed vehicle). It also appears the AI Drivers have been drinking...while it's nice that they don't always perform the perfect lap, they will frequently slam into corners or boost directly into a wall.The physics in the game can cause frustration, as you slap to a halt after performing a jump or snag on a slightly uphill piece of track.  There is also an oddity that before a race gets underway you get a glimpse of the tablet UI for the game, but that doesn't impact the experience in any meaningful way.At the time of writing, there were no active multiplayer servers.It's very hard to recommend Mini Motor Racing EVO except for the extremely casual gamer who's unfamiliar with racing titles and just wants a little fun zipping around a track.

												DO NOT BUY THISI tried to finish the game in order to write a proper review, but I gave up. This game makes pretty much every mistake an arcade racer can make. The first couple of races are just fine, but later on the issues this game has start ruining it to such an extend it is no longer fun to play.The AI: Probably the biggest issue. They are not on the track to win. They are there to make sure you don't win. Without hesitation they will boost into you from every possible angle in order to slow you down or flip you over. When the best strategy in a racing game involves restarting the race so many times until you manage to make a clean getaway instead of actually racing your opponents, you know things are not as they should be.Wonky car handling: It's an arcade racer, so realistic car handling is not to be expected. But the cars in this game behave very vague and inconsistent, making for a very frustrating experience. Good examples of the weird car physics are slopes or ramps. You can drive onto them in the exact same spot for 5 laps and everything's just fine and on lap 6 it suddenly spins your car around on the spot and brings you to a dead stop (after which 9 times out of 10 an AI boosts into you to finish the job). And don't even think about driving off or onto a slope while steering as it will make you spin out of control instantly.Invisible objects: A lot of the tracks are plagued with invisible objects and walls on the corners. In some corners the cars can pretty much clip through objects without issue, and on other corners you find yourself smashing into an invisible wall that is sticking out into the track.Prize money too low: With the very low amounts of prize money you get, it becomes a real grind in order to fully upgrade a 2nd, let alone a 3rd car. And you absolutely want multiple cars in the later cups in order to use their individual strengths and weaknesses for different tracks. It's a shame really, as the general design of this game is very good. Graphics, track design, music and car design are all very nicely done, but it's the actual gameplay that ruins it. If you're looking for a good micro machines-style racer, then look at Bang Bang Racing instead. While that game also has it's issues it is much more enjoyable then this one.			",74,21,11,6,17,0,14

												Racing games and I never got along very well. I keep the accellerator on, keep bumping in everything, turn too much or not enough, or not in the right direction. And the whole macho street racing, girls in tank tops, alpha male fast and furious coating that many of the games seem to be aiming for really turns me off. When it came to this game it was like playing with my childhood's toy cars. Sure I sucked, but I didnt mind because the tracks were super simple, the presentation was clean and crisp, the gameplay worked well, the other cars - although they kept beating me - also did stupid stuff like I did, even if you lose all the time you get a small amount of money to put into upgrading your cars at the garage, and there are lots of cars. This game is super cute, and would easily appeal to people of a younger age or casual gamers and people who are not into racing. And if pricepoint matters to you five dollards and with a sale... You could do a lot worse than picking this up. This game is the first racing game in my collection that rewarded me for making a racing tab in my library rather than adding all of them into the storage tab.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a cute little racer, reminiscent of the Amiga racer All Terrain Racing, that will hit both your pleasure and frustration buttons.  The two major frustrating elements are the collisions that almost always favour the AI racers, and also the lack of progress syncing in between races.  You'd better quit and restart on your own every few races to save your races and your money, because a game or a system crash will obliterate any progress from that session.As for the game itself, it is a satisfying combination of good driving, tactics, and upgrades that will see you to the finish line.  You'll need more than just a couple of afternoons to make it to the end, and every time you make it past that one difficult course, it feels just great.  A worthwhile purchase if you like small, classic racers.			",187,61,18,28,14,3,15

												The game is a very quirky and cute RC car racer.  The AI isn't as bad as everyone seems to be saying it is.  Playing on anything higher than easy greatly improves the AI experience, and makes the game a real challenge.  The bumper car-style gameplay goes away once you ramp up the difficulty.The graphics are that of a very high end mobile game, and it shows that it is actually a mobile game.  The controls are actually a very good port of touch based controls, from the mobile game.  It includes all the DLC mobile maps that you originally had to shell out money for, and does so in style.  It's a true proper mobile to PC port, removing all the bad bits of mobile ports and keeping the good.  The good being very fun 15 minutes at a time game sessions.Racing wise, the handling can get a little sloppy on a few maps.  There are some bumps that just shouldn't exist, and can cause you to fly off the map.  However some might say those are simply skill challenges and you need to slow down.  Outside of getting air handling is very tight and well done.  You don't drive on ice like in GTA, instead you drive tight turns when you mean to, and wide turns when you mean to.  It's very easy to control, probably due to it's extremely sloppy control background on mobile games.  Seriously, touch racing is impossible.There is a variety of maps, and quite a lot of cars.  A truly endless amount if you include the workshop.  There is also a map editor for you to make maps for your friends, or to upload to the workshop.Which leads to the next thing...  Multiplayer.  It's very well implemented and not at all laggy.  It's very fun to race and bash you're buddies, just like in any other game.I picked the game up on a whim of liking cute RC racers, and I don't regret it one bit.  If you're the same, go ahead and grab it.  If you're looking for a captivating, serious racer, look elsewhere.			",537,88,45,90,61,9,88

												I've changed my mind. This game is AWFUL, AWFUl, AWFUL! And i still will try to beat it.. Because it looks cute and is fun occasionally, when you manage to take lead. But.. physics are just outrages. Your car bumps on many invisible bumps on the road. If you improve handling it starts making circles if you turn a little bit harder. You can make you car fast and leap far ahead, but then you will chase the last ones and they will DEVASTATE you and make you lose the race. Yes, AI is stupidly aggressive, just going straight ahead to kill you, no matter what, on turns on long straights, etc.			",103,29,6,15,14,0,61

												I really can't understand why this has mixed reviewsVery Similar to Bang Bang Racing. Ala -  a modern Skidmarks or Super Sprint clone.So compared to Bang Bang Racing -Graphics about the same, same Annoying AIAbout the same difficulty.I like both but there are differences, this has more tracks and cars to unlock.This also has more upgrades to vehicles and this is half the price.One major difference is that this has online multiplayer where as Bang Bang does not but the main difference between the 2 games is obvious as soon as you try to steer your vehicle.Bang Bang Racing is the simple left,right steering  push left to steer left and push right to steer right,now Mini Motor Racing Evo is basically to push the joypad stick in the general direction of where you want to go, so push up to go up, but does it well in that if you rotate the stick to the direction you want, rather than just push it in that direction it steers quite smoothly,This is a fun racer, not sure of the lastability of it but it's worth it for a few hours play or if you have a few friends you can play with even better. Totally worth the money, especially the price on some of the sites I've seen.			",221,26,41,3,10,1,11

												This game is decent but had some issues with it that kind of bugged me. One of the issues I had with it was the random falling through the maps which got annoying at times when you would fly really high off a jump. The others are just small ones like when you turn on your side it feels like forever before it puts you back on your wheels. The AI in this game aren't the best of drivers and run into you alot so try to brake from the packs and get to first place fast. The multiplayer achievements are easy to get, just create a private game alone and set it up to one lap, win it, then you will get the multiplayer achievements. I never played the game with friends but I could imagine it would be fun. This is a must play with a Xbox 360 controller, it would be crazy annoying to play this with keyboard and mouse. With each track it shakes things up with different angles and changes every time to almost make the track seem new but once you learn the tracks then you should be fine since it repeats alot of tracks. This is a great casual game that I really enjoyed. It didn't take long to 100%. I would suggest trading to get this game or just waiting till it goes on sale on Steam.

												The artstyle and graphics are beautiful. The tracks are fun. But is it a good game?No! The AI drivers behave like they're alone on track, constantly bumping into each other and the player. And as if that's not enough the smallest collisions slow you down to a crawl, spin your car around and thus make you vulnerable for yet more AI drivers to crash into you, repeating the cycle. But if you manage to get a good start and survive the first 10 seconds the AI drivers will take each other out every too often and it's too easy to drive home a win. Unless you get screwed by lapped cars, of which there are way too many for these small grids and 1-2 minute races.A lot of good games lack the polish. This nicely polished game lacks functioning game mechanics.Don't buy this game!			",151,28,18,11,34,3,28

												It pains me to say this but I'm not going to recommend Mini Motor Racing EVO basically down to the game having really bad physics.  Most of my play time was spent racing with a friend in 1v1 races which were generally decided by how the physics treated the player.  In some occasions a vehicle could get flipped on its side seemingly randomly and on a lot  of occasions an agressive side-swipe at my opponent would leave me in a worse off situation than him!  There seemed to be no realism or accuracy in the physics therefore removing any type of skill factor in the driving and racing.

Now the game looks really nice and fun.  It almost seems criminal to me to make a top-down racing game appear so nice and colorful to look at but then get let down by such a major game-breaking factor!There's a large array of cars to choose from and an even more impressive track selection with day and night variants.  I learned today that the game also has Steam Workshop for creating and sharing your own track designs!!You have an option of two different systems to control your vehicle.  The first type is the more conventional method of rotate/steer the car clockwise/anti-clockwise and the second type is to push in the direction you want to travel.  Now the second method of pusing in the desired direction of travel sounds awful to me but I actually found it a more efficient way to play this game.  You still have to accelerate and brake the same with both methods.  It's worth testing them both out with an open mind and seeing which works best for you.There is no local co-op feature but the online multiplayer works fine.  I'm not sure about the playerbase but I managed to find my steam friend to play with without any problems and our games ran smoothly.So many positive points about this game let down by a lack of fine-tuning in the physics.  The game boasts ""cross-platform multiplayer"" so possibly the physics were acceptable on a mobile platform.  I think on the PC platform we expect a bit more from our game.If you can put up with the clunky physics and have a friend or three to play with then you could have some fun for sure.  For me though, it removed almost all competiveness and thus removed the fun and motivation to race further.			",1300,356,64,91,101,18,164

												Want to be angry? Buy this. When I bought this, I thought it will be a great game, which is fun to play. The graphics are great, even if they're cartoonish, but the controls... The worst ""racing"" physics in a PC game, ever! You could have problems with taking the first corner, so watch out! Prepare for it, the AI and the whole physics are against you. They will nitro your♥♥♥♥♥ just before a corner. Everyone flies, but - guess what - you will be the last one on the racing line again, always. This isn't racing anymore, just making players angry. Or maybe it should be renamed to Mini Motor Derby EVO.Wanted more fun. 5/10!			",46,3,16,2,10,1,10

												A nice Funracer with workshop support and ""online"" multiplayer.But only a few players online. Most of the times the servers a empty.But shortwhile a good singleplay Game.Large number of vehicles with multiple tuning options. Few basic routes in single player mode. Routes are mirrored or the camera angle changes to the feeling to convey it would be other routes. Through the editor it is possible to create your own routes and upload them to the workshop. The best way to hit in Deal. Then it offers good value for money.			",471,137,48,60,187,8,67

												This game really isn't worth it. Here's what sucks!1. AI is awful. Want to know how to get 1st place every time? Restart until you get lucky enough for those idiots to crash into each other instead of you. That works well until you start to lap them and they all try to sabotage you. Feels more like a 1v5 race instead of a 6 person race.2. Repetitive maps. They re-use the same maps over and over, putting different spins on them (race backwards! now race at night!) and some of the camera angles cause you to completely not be able to see your car. Here's the #1 thing I want from a racing game: TO BE ABLE TO SEE MY CAR3. A bunch of cars with little difference between them. Just take the starting car and use it until you unlock the car you get for finishing the beginner cup and then upgrade that and you win the game.On the bright side, it has some cool TF2 and Portal 2 levels and it has Workshop support. I can't help but to think the Workshop support is just there because the developers didn't feel like making many tracks of their own.			",433,80,22,74,55,5,96

												The game is pretty good for what it is, nice visuals, sounds, variety of cars and whatnot but it's ruined by a serious flaw. The difficulty is insane. This certainly ain't a game for the kiddies, I'll tell ya' that now. There are two problems that factor in together for this.The first is that the physics are very aggravating at times. It is borderline inconceivable to maintain any sort of speed when attempting to corner. You will either end up having to slow down to a crawl or letting off the acceleration for a brief second and doing subtle taps in order to turn but that still annihiliates your speed. It may be easier with an analog control such as a joystick, wheel or a game pad but I haven't tried this.The second is that the AI opponents are EXTREMELY brutal and relentless. They WILL shunt you at any opportunity they get and you WILL eventually get spun out and there is nothing you can do. Simple as that. If you do get spun out, you lose, good luck catching up afterwards. Get used to it. You could still try by saving your nitros but I wouldn't count on it.This game is actually quite a lot of fun but you'd either have to be extremely lucky, have a lot of patience or just like losing races every now and then in order to enjoy this. For a game that you would play for about 20 minutes each time, it shouldn't be this difficult.			",588,168,51,53,65,8,60

You stay out of harms way by using your nitro all at once, by taking the lead your getting all the extra nitro and you win.I thought that the TF2 and Portal connection would ensure some quality but I was naieve.There is no AI or physics, it feels like the crappy racing games of the 90's.Still I'm enjoying myself because it makes me feel like a kid with those toycars.So if your not the kinda guy that steals the little matchbox cars from kids you better move along.

That way you can blame that instead of the horrid camera angles and zoomed in-your-face short race tracks.			",79,20,3,14,16,0,23

So you need to invite people from your friends list.It's a very nice game and really addictive.+ Many Cars & Upgrades+ A Lot of Tracks+ Multiplayer Online- No Player Online- You race the same track very oftenFinal score - 8/10 !!

												This game had a somewhat decent amount of potential, but it falls flat on its face trying to deliver.First off, the AI is ridiculously agressive and will often slam into you as well as eachother, making having to use turbos to quickly take a solid lead ahead practically the ONLY option. Then there's the handling, it takes a while to get used to but the majority of cars will still handle like crap, making the game virtually unplayable with the lower-handling vehicles. The optimizatin is also relatively poor for what's easily considered a phone game, since the framerate can drop on the night tracks while it's near a consistent 60 on day tracks.

												It's a lot of fun at first, but it gets repetitive after a while. The models and tracks are really cool to look at and fun to play, though the A.I. really likes to box you into corners you can't get out of. On some levels, this isn't a huge problem, but on others it means you've already lost. The cars themselves are cute and some of the paint schemes and models are references to pop culture (like the Scooby van and DeLorean look-alikes). The level editor is ultimately disappointing, because you can only buld flat tracks. So while the pre-built levels wow you with verticality and variety, you're stuck with novice-level custom options.  Since this game hasn't been updated since 2013, I'm guessing this won't be changing anytime soon.Overall, I'd say pick it up when it's on sale. However, $5 is still pretty cheap, and it's at least that much fun.			",158,48,4,18,12,2,7

												Short answer: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.I both love and hate this game. When it's fun, it's great fun. When the AI, broken physics, and horrible collision detection screw you over, you'll wish Steam had a feature to remove a game from your library for good.It's a shame, really, because this game is SO close to being right up there with RC Pro Am, Indy Heat, and a few other racers of this type. Some work on fixing collisions, AI, and car physics could make this legendary.As it stands, I'd recommend you buy it if it's on sale or part of a bundle and you like this genre.Pros:Great graphicsGood assortment of levelsOK musicCons:Shoddy car physicsBad enemy AIPoor collision detectionZero replay valueThree BS achievements: Mini Motor Champion (Master), Moneybags, and Mini Motor Master.

												WHAT a great game!I have about 4 mini-racer type games and this is by far the best!  The STEERING is GREAT, you rotate the movement stick (is that called the d-pad?) into your turns and continuously to avoid jerky movements. At first I had some issues and annoyance with the steering but then it became smooth and desired.  +Steering+Graphics+Optimized well (had issues with another mini-racer bang-bang-racing that was in slow-mo lagging yet my pc runs most AAA games)+Just enough maps (some in reverse or night for diversity, could use a few more tho)+Portal 2 track lol.+Price-Can't change camera rotation or have the track rotate to your direction, so at first its hard to know which way to turn.If you liked RC pro-am this is the closest I've noticed except its not twisted metal combat or dropping anything like most, this is a racer! Don't be deterred by the mixed rating, after an hour you should get a feel for it.  9/10 based on price.			",314,64,48,19,11,3,23

												This game packs a lot of fun into a small down load and it even comes with a tack editor.  I first played this on my android tablet and still do.  I have read other reviews stating that the control set up with the game pad is not very good and that may be the case, I use the mouse option, it takes a bit of getting use to, but is the only way to get the cars to respond quick enough to stay on the track and off the walls.  A bit of advice, take the BIG RIG, it is the fastest one of the bunch, and upgrade the handeling a few tic's first, and don't max out the boost as it will become to strong and blast you into the wall everytime.  Run every track a few times to learn them and earn cash for upgrades.  Don't worrie about the boots and cash icons that pop up on the track, race to win and get the full pay out for the effort.

												A game that makes you wanna smash your Controller into your screen. In case you don't even have a controller don't even bother trying to play this - it's pretty hopeless. The cause of rage isn't even one's own mistakes. Races are either too easy (start to finish wins) or just impossible to win due to overpowered opponents. There's almost no fighting, no adrenaline, no excitement. The game's mechanics are flawed: Winning or losing depends too much on the car and not enough on skill.Unless you're a die-hard fan of the genre, this game is probably not worth playing.

												Altough the basic gameplay can be quite a lot of fun, it quickly wears out, it lacks variety, there are basically no pickups during the races, you can either pick up more cash or boost, and that's about it, it would be cool if there was more variety to the kind of things you can find during the races.But even not having them, I could justify myself keeping it if the online multiplayer was alive, or even better, if it featured some kind of local splitscreen or whatever multiplayer mode, but it doesn't, so, basically it's a very barebones package, which is a shame, because I love the handling and I think it's a pretty comfy looking game, but alas, I can't justify myself paying 1.24$ for it.Edit: a newer and better version of this game is abviable for free on Android, if you really like the aesthethics and the handling, better off playing that one.

												I got this as part of a dirt cheap bundle.  The graphics are cute and do the job well for the kind of game it is. I struggled with the controls a bit on the Xbox 360 controller. So used to normal racing games where the analog sticks mimic a steering wheel, and that doesn't apply at all here. It's more like you move the stick in the direction you want the car to go.  I found that incredibly awkward for a racing game. Maybe its just me.I can't really recommend this for adult gamers, but maybe if you have kids they'd like it.  There's not enough here to keep me playing beyond the first set of races.  It just doesn't do anything for me.			",137,27,21,47,50,3,64

												One of the greatest racing games I've played period.Its alot like micro machines in the 90s loads of fun. The tracks are great and alot of references to other games.Best part is you can race VANS with paint jobs that look like A team, Scooby doo and Ninja Turtles does it get any better than that??

												First cup just about done (lots and lots of races) and races on intermediate and expert done so i might be a bit early to say this but i think this game is the king of slick's'slide type of games. Some points why i think like this: a) No rubber band AI.b) No messing around with the camera like Bang Bang does (except for start grid) a HUGE plus right there. camera does move but it's fine. c) Car upgrade system.  You can make good races against faster cars on harder cups - if you are a good driver -  later buying upgrades ensures that you will eventualy start to catch up AI opponents if you dont make it in the races with a inferior car.. i.e. the game is tilted in the beginning so that your car is slow but as you become beter driver and get more upgrades you start to own the opposition one way or the other. 'No driver left behind' -policy i guess you can call it. :) d) related to part c. there will always be a challenge left for you. tons of races and cups and AI will (literaly) push you hard around. And should you think that races get too easy? well you can switch the car but the catch is that upgrades are always tied to certain cars so if you want something else or unlock a new car then you need to start over.

												A modern day Micro Machines. If you've been waiting for a remake/sequel to Micro Machines this might be just the fix you are looking for. On the surface the game is pretty simple, but it's really quite complex in design. Cars, with seeming similar stats, can prove to handle quite differently from track to track. Some cars are better at tight corners, some better off-road. This type of gameplay definitely encourages upgrading multiple cars rather than sticking to just one. Sometimes the AI can be super frustrating and uneven surfaces can make your car handle unpredictably, but overall this is a game worth checking out. There is a good online multiplayer experience too.			",97,30,7,15,9,0,15

												If you have played Micro Machines or Super Off-Road in the 90's, you may like this one! This gameplay is quite good, graphics are nice and cartoonish. However, the AI is a bit stupid and can make you lost a race because they crashed into you during a turn using a Nitro... The solo championship is a bit repetitive as it is a mix of about 8 tracks but in reverse or various times of the day. If you want it, get it on sales! It has a very easy to use track editor and it is good fun for not more than 4 euros :)			",352,62,37,12,48,3,8

It will also appeal to anybody that really liked RC Pro-AM or Super Offroad, the cars have similar handling. The tracks are pretty good, and there are licensed Valve and Fruit Ninja tracks that feature audio from their respective games.			",370,126,10,67,35,6,76

												A while back I bought the original mini motors game on IOS. I found it to be a pretty decent racer. i got some money for christmas to use one steam and one of the games i bought was Mini Motor Racing EVO. I thought the developers would have at least added some fresh new content. however, all I got was two new tracks, two cars and that's it. nothing has changed since the IOS version at all. It seems like they just got the original game and copied and pasted it on PC. Y'all should just get the IOS version and save money instead.			",49,6,7,0,11,0,3

												Mini Motor Ramming NITROThe game is presented well, but unfortunatly the AI is terrible. Not terrible as in stupid, terrible as in insane. They will constantly ram you off the road, box you in etc . They are not doing this as a clever way of getting ahead, but because they are just plain ignoring you.If you want to win any race, just Nitro at the start to clear the rolling wave of destruction that is the rest of the pack, and cruise the 3 laps or so to victory. Repeat 300 times for every race (numbers from the Steam achievements) and Game over.Otherwise you will be stuck bouncing off walls, other cars, until the torment is final over.

												The Artificial intelligence in this game is bad with a capital B. I suppose if you can overlook getting knocked around by all the other cars the entire race you may enjoy this. Sound effects and graphics are good. I did not enjoy being bounced around the track by the other cars. If you can keep first place you will not notice this however if your in second or third be prepared to get knocked around other cars. I have not tried online. I did bring this up in forum about 6 months ago and crickets so far. I dont expect them to patch this any more then they already have. AI is dumb to the point of being unfun.

Intro:Mini Motor Racing EVO looks great on the Steam store page. You're immediately greeted by solid visuals, decent music, and a list of features such as online multiplayer, level editor with workshop support, and even some content from Valve games... Unfortunately, looks can be deceiving.Also, despite my low hours I did complete this game. Its very short.Gameplay:The biggest flaw with this game is the gameplay. Its not particularly bad. Its just incredibly dull. The level layouts aren't interesting and not much of anything happens throughout the races.Its not really bad, its just boring and almost a drag to play through. This isn't me disliking this style of racing games either as I've played others that were much better.Another issue I have with the game is while there are plenty of cars to choose from, some of them are much better than others. I found myself having to play with vehicles I didn't like in order to win the races. You also need to keep upgrading them constantly which can be a bit obnoxious.By the time I finished the game I had no real desire to ever touch it again.Story, Visuals, & Music:The game looks pretty decent. Some of the levels have interesting themes so I can't complain much about that. The music was okay. It was mixed well enough to sound professional, but the tracks were incredibly lacking in terms of the compositions. Nothing stood out at all - it was just a bunch of dull backing tracks basically. PC Version:I don't recall any issues with how the game ran itself.Conclusion:Its really not a bad game, but its uninteresting and a bore to play.If online multiplayer isn't very important to you and you want to play a game like this, check out Bang Bang Racing.It may not have as much flashy features, but its actually a fun game.Give that one go.

												Pros: The game handles great with a Xbox 360 controller joystick once you understand how it works. The colors are vibrant and the tracks vary in environment. It's a top down racer and brings back nostalgic feelings of arcade games of old. It's fun overall most of the time. The game is not too easy in that you will not blow through this with ease. Some tracks you will be racing as aggressive as possible just to come in the top 3 to get some decent money. There is a Multiplayer option.Cons: It's fun MOST of the time. The other time that it's not fun is due to the punishing AI and questionable framerate issues. I was running this with an overclocked HD4650 and had framerate issues even when the settings were set to Low or Off on everything. ***(Upgrading to a HD7850 corrected these issues)***There are times that you will race right through the map and respawn as other cars race ahead of you. At times you will end up upside down and as long as you are moving, you won't respawn right side up to continue the race. In other words, prepare to yell at the screen as you are sliding on your side at 5mph as everyone races past you or hits you and continues the slide to your defeat.Binary Mill states that my settings were enough to run the game, but not enough for it to run decently to actually play apparently. Developer needs to give better System Requirements for this game. The AI are downright brutal and will often try to wreck you right into a wall or sandwich you into other people like an adult flick. There is a Multiplayer option (see above). Only thing is that Binary Mill's servers are down and according to the forums (and how far this issue goes back), that will not change anytime soon or possibly ever. If you buy this game, don't expect multiplayer.			",121,43,7,18,9,1,6

												This game pretty much sucks. I have no idea why I played all the way through the expert championship.The AI sucks and pretty much just plows through whatever's in its way, which is frequently you. The physics suck, so when the AI plows through you there's no telling which way you'll be facing or how long it will take until your car is upright again.When I say ""the physics suck,"" I mean your car handles like a balloon. Except when it handles like a plastic bag. It's the floatiest racer I've ever played.About half of the tracks suck, and the ones that don't will feel like they suck because your field of view is limited and the angle at which the track is presented is arbitrary. (I really do mean ""arbitrary."" Sometimes the same track will be presented from a different direction for no good reason. Often the chosen direction maximizes the extent to which you can't actually see your car or the track on some turns.)By the time you've upgraded your car, you can lap more than half the other racers by the end of the second lap. Except the guy in second will pass you once you're forced to pass the clowns in the bottom slots again, because it's very difficult to pass an AI that pretends you're not there unless you're also an AI, which the guy in second is.Oh, right, and all the music is at best boring. Some of it is actually irritating.Remember how annoying the yellow car was in RC Pro Am? I'd rather play that game any day of the week.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really like this game, it's a very interesting take on the mini car racer, it's fun to play for a few hours straight and it has quite the skill ceiling to master.Pros:- Mouse controls work incredibly- It has a really wide variety of maps and cars- It has nice music- It has nice graphicsCons:- Keyboard controls are bad- Some maps have clipping issues- AI performance is all over the place, there's maps where you'll have another car on your tail the whole race and others you'll lap the second place.- Multiplayer is dead- Each race has a fixed camera angle, it'll play a great deal on how well you can see the map's complicated part of the track.- Power ups are random, they can appear anywhere on the map and their timeout is not tied to the race start- When going uphill the mouse arrow will clip into the groundIt has more cons and pros, but it's worth it.

No, it has a few issues like the commonly mentioned physics being a bit out of whack at times but it's such a great game and lots of fun.  I will say this though, I actually prefer it on the iPhone and the controls are fantastic for that version.  You're missing out on steam workshop and the TF2/Portal tracks that way but it's still great.  The game has some good music for it as well, which brings up pretty much my only real complaint.. no way to download or purchase a soundtrack.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I like racing games unfotunately this game could of been so much better but it fails at so many levels.  It has repetitive maps, bad AI, also, the game gets boring very quickly and it has ZERO replay value.  The developers could of added more achievements to this game. For example Finish first by being ahead on every lap or dead last as another achievement. There is no multiplayer for this game. No one is ever online. The only positives about this game is that the graphics are nice and that the achievements are all attainable,  Otherwise if you like being tortured playing this game I strongly do not recommend it.4.5/10			",712,225,17,21,59,7,73

												Mini Motor Racing EVO seems like a cute and charming top down racing game, however as you play more and more the game becomes a complete grindfest using the same tracks over and over with slight modifications later such as the camera angle, racing at night or in reverse. The AI is terrible and if you do not get a clean getaway from the rest of the pack of the cars you will not win the race. I continue to play the game to see if the game will pick up but after 10 hours and beating all 4 championships there is nothing different than the first couple of races when you first start the game. Pretty difficult to recommend unless you want a mindless racing game where once you are first the AI will never catch up with you because, well it drives like it's drunk. Don't drink and drive or else you'll be like the AI.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The AI structure is very poorly thought out so the cars wouldn't give a **** about piling upon other cars, including you. I've lost track of how many times I had to restart a race due to a single pileup being the difference between first and last.

												Unforgivingly brutal AI whose sole intention is to make you spin out. Any collision causes the crappy handling to give up on you. Even if you escape the derby that is the AI, seemingly invisible walls stop you in your tracks and allow them to catch up with you to punish you further - This game makes me ragequit :Steamsalty:			",263,67,25,20,19,2,26

												The game is cute. And that is all that's positive about it. Otherwise it's easy, repetitive and boring.UPDATE: Once you get to MASTER level, it gets harder, but it's far from impossible. Using a right car (and spending enough money on it) makes things easy once again.			",608,257,33,89,62,8,118

												This is the first game in my library I do not recommend.It is not the game from the advertising video. It doesn't feel like a micromachines / childhood mini cars experience. I rushed to buy the game but then I was dissapointed (there were no steam refunds at the time, 2013).I have had controller issues since day one. Have tried with different controllers and all of them feels different, work or don't and have to configure them every time. Even when controls are mapped, the game plays awful. Physics will make sure you get in the last place. Forget about using turbo, you'll ruin your hard earned place. If you manage to be in 1st place for the first 15 seconds then you have a chance of winning the race but if your opponent is 10 seconds away from you in a better place then just restart the race, it is impossible to catch up.I did however managed to run the game when I recently purchased it with one controller (it worked and felt really well) and this is when I could play the game (and used to recommend it as a casual racer) but very little time then the controller died on me and had to rely on mouse or keyboard (mouse is the best alternative so far but keyboard is too laggy). I've been struggling with the game ever since, trying different controllers every now and then but none of them seem to work like the first one, maybe it is the latest patch that brought like a new controller backend but instead it messed it up.The level editor is really good though, have spent many hours building custom tracks.In conclusion, it is a good casual racing game if you are tolerant to frustration but it is not a game for you if you do not like to lose.

												Not a great game.  Not even a good game.  It feels like a phone app.  So much so, i keep expecting to see the add funds dialog pop up.  The steering is quirky, again, like it was designed for smart phones.  The graphics are bright and colorful, and the tracks are decent, albeit, short.  After about 2 hrs i'm done. ready to uninstall and not look at it again until my son is old enough to play games.  If a developer is going to go so far as to develop a pc port, they really need to rework a few things, not just gloss it over.  BTW: the description says improved physics...well, i have never seen a traffic cone shoot 6 cars straight through the air, in any racer.  So, yeah, there are no physics.Worth 5, no. Young kids may like it, but it may also result in their first rage quit.			",518,168,18,112,85,4,112

I woud like to  see maybe some randomized cirquit generator, but its fine as it is. for me its a 7-8 easy this game. give it a try, 5 bucks, no big deal			",563,137,37,58,60,10,58

												Despite the poor reviews, I genuinely enjoyed this game. It's a fun game to play however, I would strongly recommend using an external source of control such as an Xbox controller or the controls can be fairly difficult. The whole game is very simple and easy to get into, the AI isn't great but sometimes provides a good challenge. I finished first in every race within about 6 hours. To expand gameplay beyond the single player experience, the developers have included a multiplayer option, The only downside to this is that I have never found anyone to play against because only about ten people actually play this game. There is a map builder option which is very fun and the mobile version lacks. The maps can be shared via the Steam workshop and you can download and play maps that the community have created for free. I do recommend this game however, purchase it for your Smartphone/Tablet instead where is is a fraction of the price and works much better for what it is. That is of course unless you would like the extra features and achievements.			",71,1,2,4,10,0,5

												Mini Moter Racing Evo is a pretty good racing game, that I enjoyed playing.  In this game you drive smaller versions of bigger cars on small tracks, kind of like child sized. There are quite a variety of cars to choose from, each somewhat different than the other.  The game has 40 tracks as it says on the store page, and there are night and day versions of each.  Each version also has their own song.  The point of the game is to go through championships, and gain money to upgrade your car.  Now each car can be upgraded, but be careful where you spend your money as early on it is hard to make money.  Swapping from car to car giving each of them upgrades would cause you to have no money and bad cars.  The unlockable cars are pretty nice, you get one for completing a championship and completing certain races for the portal team fortress and fruit ninja cars.  Though I never used them because I wouldn't be able to afford to upgrade them.  The Achievements in this game are rather easy to get except the last achievement which is the money bags one.  It requires you to have 100,000$ cash on hand at once, which is impossible because you upgrade your cars, and that costs a lot of money.  One downfall of the game is the repetitiveness.  Each track is recycled over and over again, so by the time you finish the game you've played each track 20 times both day and night, so it does get boring after a while.  The AI is absolutely idiotic and does not improve over time, all that makes the game harder later on is that all the AI's cars are upgraded, and the races are more laps.  Near the end the races are so long and take nearly 2 minutes each, and since there is a 100 races in the master cup it's insanely time consuming, and unfortunately it becomes boring.  The controls for me were quite easy to figure out but they might cause a problem for some people.  Overall I did enjoy the game because of the music mostly, the tracks were ok, and AI annoyed me at times.  For 5$ I'd say there are better games but it's ok.			",274,43,11,45,13,1,33

												This game looks good,nice clean tidy graphics and runs fine (doesn't push hardware at all) but that is where it ends,the music is bad,the controls are simply crap and feel very basic,you can turn your car 360 while not pressing the accel and it will happily just spin and spin forever and when you accelerate and try to turn your extremely slow little car round the track you will over steer as there is no difference between the way the car turns when stationary and when the car is moving and this makes your car slow down even more ! It's just painfully dull in terms of gameplay and there is no knack to the controls where you finally see the light and say ahh soo this is why the game controls like this !!You can use a controller and use a degree of turning with the stick and your car won't slow down as much but it's still crap,this is just a very basic amateur feeling silly little game,the car has no momentum,no physics,there is simply no feeling at all to the controls and with the game being soo slow and then you turn and your car freaks out and spins because you over tun or slows down even more it just feels frustrating.The game is crap - buy at your own risk !

												My first impression is that this is a fun, casual game. It's more of a novelty arcade type of game than a serious one. If the screenshots shows anything you might be interested in, it's probably going to suit you.I have yet to try online racing. I've been playing career mode just to get the hang of things. Right off the bat, the AI seems fairly easy to beat and the tracks fairly small, but the cups have so far all been labeled as ""beginner"".Some good things are workshop support for race tracks and full controller support. There's also a couple of small treats for TF2 and Portal fans.			",254,50,2,25,15,2,21

												This is a very simple and fun racing game. For those that grew up playing the old NES games and remember them, this game is a cross between RC: Pro AM and Super Off Road racing. My only complaint for this game is the controls which use a rare style and generally disliked (tested with controller). Most racing games left is turn left, right is turn right. This game uses the control style of point in the direction you want the car to go as if you were drawing a line through the course. If your alright with that control style you probably will enjoy the game.Best to pick up on a sale when you can for simple and fun enjoyment.			",187,30,24,15,18,2,22

												This game takes me back to the good old days of the NES, games like RC Pro Am and Micro Machines were some of my favorite racing games back then, it's too bad they don't make many games like that much anymore but when I see one I have to at least try it. This one has good visuals, tight controls and cool content from other games such as Portal, Team Fortress 2 and Fruit Ninja.The problem though is that you have to race the same tracks too many times for each championship, the other driver AI isn't very intelligent and there's nobody to play online. It's a good game overall, not great. I would recommend you wait for a sale if you are curious about the game.			",1599,519,67,166,127,16,152

												Forst off I hated this then as I kept playing i began to understand and really enjoy it but gonna give you a hint if you decide to get this fun racing game!Hint:If you do a quick racing your will fishtail all over the track I highly recommend playing career so you can buy a good car and upgrade it will handling then move onto other things like speed and such! In career you will need to win a few racing and using horrible fishtail cars but if you win soon you will have the money to get better handling upgrades so quick racing not recommended lol. I like this game and not to shabby I spent less than what steam is asking for it but thats my own secret if you wanna know add me as a friend and i will reveal the better deal to you personally :)!

												Nothing special, but a lot of mindless fun, at least to me, all very simple. It's casual, but have a grinding component that keeps me playing, although the rewards are too sparse.The worst part is the annoying AI. The AI opponents are not dumb, but they will forget the race just to crash on you. Sometimes you even start and they bang on, one by one, leaving you trying to recover the race. They are experts on doing that, it's like developers wanted to troll us. The scenery have some glitches you may learn.It's exactly what you get on mostly 10 dollar game. Something fun, you feel that lacks some polish, not much depth or resources. But still enjoyable, funny and a little addictive, but the AI doesn't let you play a lot of time without losing patience, may be a good thing.			",685,344,30,98,83,8,127

												This game is not that great.  BUT if you like mini-car racing and want a few to a few dozen hours of distraction this is OK.The cars are really cute, the maps are just the right size and look great, and the music is groovy to race by and suits each map perfectly.Racing is mostly fun and the cars handle as you would expect, however the AI is a complete joke.  Instead of actually racing intelligently, the AI approach is demolition-derby.  This starts out as a minor annoyance, but as you progress through the different championships it gets worse and worse to the point you just want to scream.A couple of times I encountered bugs in the car selection / upgrade menu that forced me to manually shut down the game.  One time it caused me to lose 2 hours of progress because the game needs to close down gracefully before it saves your progress.  To prevent future occurrences of that I had to QTD and restart about every 5 races :/Multiplayer is dead and one of the achievements is so stupid (have $100,000 career cash in your wallet) that to get it you'll have to beat the game, THEN play an additional 10+ hours beating the same races over and again.Wow the more I write the more I realize that, despite that I've beaten it 100% with all achievements, I basically hate this game.4 out of 10			",132,16,5,15,7,4,16

												Worst controls I've ever played.This is supposed to be a fun racer, but the twitchy turning, the insta-slowdown when anything happens, the crappy pickup, contrasted with the excessive speed boost granted by the turbo make for the most uncontrollable, unplayable car racing game ever.It's not a simulator, and it doesn't qualify as a fun racer, so it's in some weird limbo. I give it 2 out of 10, and that's because the graphics are really nice.			",74,9,5,28,4,0,18

												It's an arcade racer where you control a cute-looking toy car from an overhead view using the analog stick. The control scheme has a small learning curve if you've never played this type of game before -- the car moves similarly to how a vehicle in a twin-shooter moves. Once you've got the controls figured out, it feels very natural and satisfying, and powerslides come easily.Overall, the game is very good-looking and polished. There are a couple of cars and tracks based on TF2 and Portal 2. Not surprisingly for a mobile port, the variety is lacking and the game quickly wears out its welcome. The various cups just consist of the same tracks used over and over again, sometimes run in reverse or at nighttime or with varying numbers of laps. Every racing game does this obviously, but in this case, the tracks are so short and the game mechanics so simple that it's more noticeable...			",277,92,13,45,33,1,65

												Rating 7.5~~~ Great little game!!! Sure graphics are not the best but.. If you can get over being an image snob then this game is great for anyone. Medium paced game that puts multiple types of cars against each other (muscle /buggy /sprint /truck /exotic /ect). Game takes a little planing when it comes to ""When to use a nitro"" this can be a huge tool for winning a race or winidng up dead last. Game is played quite fair with minor things that seem to just screw you over to the point of no return (most provide a little laugh instead of making you mad) I would say if your looking for a fun, short, easy to 100% acheive game this is worth piking up.

Just don't expect a realistic or challenging racing experience: imagine you're in a go kart that doubles as a bumper car, and all of your opponents are slightly drunk. This is what you'll get.

Too bad it can get a bit frustrating because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI of competitors and the bad physics.The multiplayer is dead. Completing the singleplayer will take time and gets a bit of a grind after a while. Most tracks are rehashed by reversing and turning them.

If you're looking for a racing game which doesn't take itself too seriously, then give this one some consideration. If you're a big kid like me, then you'll probably love this. Definitely one which both younger and more mature players can enjoy IMHO! Plus, I haven't noticed any major bugs/glitches (yet!!). Controls were a tad light/floaty for my liking, but like I said just now, it's a great game for what it is. Give it a chance, you may be pleasantly surprised!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Since all cars are running with you or faster than you, the game physics goes totally bonkers and invisible ramps and walls start apearing on the map. I've noticed that i'm not the only one having such a problem, many other players complain about the same. And the AI completly turns to murderous massacration mode, going out of its way to actually take you out of the race, no matter if you are first place or last place. I would still recommend it, because on the mp, people seems to play it cleaner more ever than the AI can be. And the track editor is fun too.			",188,37,37,11,33,1,15

												This is a fun little racing game.  Taking a top-down camera angle, it evokes an arcade-like feel which adds to the game's charm.  There is a good variety of tracks, which include typical racing circuits, downtown cities, deserts, and even three tracks inspired by the Team Fortress 2, Portal 2, and Fruit Ninja universes, and there are even unlockable vehicles to match those franchises.  Speaking of vehicles, there are plenty to choose from, with many others waiting to be unlocked.  The actual racing is fun and even addicting at first; the controls are responsive for the most part, the pace is quick, and the races are short enough to be fun and competitive but not so short as to finish literally seconds after the green light.Issues with the game include some occasional overly-aggressive AI that seems more focused on taking you out than on actually racing, colliding with computer-controlled vehicles 9 times out of 10 ends up with you spinning out instead of them, and that most vehicles take a lot of time and money to upgrade them to match the mobility of the AI in later races, but none of these problems are not and should not be considered deal-breakers.  For whatever reason you play the game, you will enjoy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quite a lot of fun once you figure out a few of the quirks of the game, namely:1) Controls: I've been using a Xbox 360 controller and could not get used to the thumb stick for driving.  Basically your car moves in the direction of the stick; left and right are not relative to how your car is pointing.  Thankfully the digital pad works in a more traditional manner and once I realized this it was a total joy to play.2) Physics: You have to play the tracks a bit to get the hang of where the walls are and where you can shortcut.  Your car rotates on it's center (not the front) meaning you can turn on a dime and spin out if you aren't a bit gentle with the controls during turns.  The physics are also wonky when your in midair and turn your tires prematurely before you land; instant wipeout.3) Tracks: So EVERY racing game reuses tracks, makes it a differnt type of day, reverses the driving direction; no big deal.  However, this game added the challenge of also changing the orientation of the camera on repeat use of a track.  This actually makes it super challenging to revisit a track as your brain says ""this turn is here"" but on screen the turn is actually THIS OTHER WAY since the camera is now in a different position.Other things of note:1) Graphics: Very pretty.  I love the feel of the game and how smooth it flows on the screen.2) Sound/Music: Very enjoyable.3) Difficulty: Starts off easy enough; you learn when to use your 'nitro' to boost away from the pack of crazy cars and they become a non-issue.  By the 20th or so track however, the AI is competant and WILL whoop your butt.  Car upgrades are a must!Overall I've enjoyed it quite a bit and plan on treking to the end of the game.

												This game brutally teaches you that to win this game you need to get the f*** away from the AI, let me explain: These AI might appear like they want to race, but don't underestimate them, they don't just want to race you, they want you out of the race, I find myself restarting to try and get the best start possible, it appears if you can outrun the murderous enemies by nitroing the hell away from the start lane you can probably secure first for the rest of the race, in most of my experience the AI will anihilate themselves attempting to catch up with you, overall fun top-down racing game with plenty to do, I got it on sale in a bundle with other racing games, fun and challenging glad I didn't pay full price but it's worth it if you're super into racing games! ^.^			",30,1,12,2,2,0,4

												Mini Motor Racing EVO is a top down arcade racer. It looks nice and the gameplay gives a bit of that old micro machines fun. Too bad it can get a bit frustrating because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI of competitors and the bad physics.The multiplayer is dead. Completing the singleplayer will take time and gets a bit of a grind after a while. Most tracks are rehashed by reversing and turning them. But all in all you can have some fun with it, but I only recommend it if you can get it for cheap.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Freaking fun Plenty of tracks, plenty of cars, madness on mutliplayer (and even Single Player), people who loves Mario Kart may really like this, provided they settle for race cars and only nitro as a powerful.There's some problems, like the lack of windowed mode (I can't focus on a fullscreen myself for too long), slightly off physics (track boundaries and collisions with others) and minor lag that happens to most standard computers if the settings are run above low. But with plenty of content, a super fun method of gameplay, which is a little tricky to learn off the bat, and neat additional content of Portal, Fruit Ninja and Team Fortress 2, this is a game that you'll clock a few hours in at least, and is well worth it's pricing.

												So they have tried to make some sort of oldschool kind of game, but the result is kind of mixed. On one hand you have handling mechanics that are fine, the tracks seem fine, graphics are pleasant to look at, but the weird things start at the more complex things such as car specifications. How much is 5 speed and 4 acceleration versus 5 acceleration and 4 speed? Would be pretty obvious if the game didnt have such varied tracks. You cant simply drive one vehicle in every track. Ofcourse you can upgrade your vehicle for quite a bit of in game earned coin, but here is something else - most of vehicles are not unlocked in the beginning of the game. So you dont even know how some of the things behave, while you have the money to spend/waste. So you might think that - hey ill just keep this money, because the start of the game should be easy. It is easy untill a point, then you pretty much have to spend cash to progress.  And yes that means youll be spending that cash on that small selection of cars you might not like. This can easily result in a lot of money wasted on random cars that you will never drive or even if you do drive - never enjoy. So while the basics seem nice, the game does not seem very thought out in the long run.			",92,4,1,4,3,1,2

												Quite a fun casual racing game. But unfortunately only for a while. Gets repetitive very soon and hasn't got much to offer.Drive, win some cash, drive, win some cash, upgrade your car.........and so on and so forth.The most annoying thing is the AI. Computer drivers are extremely aggresive and bump each other like drunken maniacs. Sometimes it looks like famous Destruction Derby, not a racing game. Whilst the game isn't very challenging, stupid AI behaviour makes it harder and gives some sort of challenge.Overall nice, little game but only for a short period of time.  If you like classic games with little cars (just like Skidmarks or Micro Machines) you could give it a try - but not for a 10€.But do not expect too much or you will be disappointed.

												To be honest, even though it has charming graphics and music, this kind of arcade gameplay ruins the feeling a lot (instead of challenging tracks, you get lousy vehicle control). Older versions of Micro Machines are a way better alternative.			",633,181,20,104,58,6,120

												You get some games like this that are a blast for the first hour or two but then start to wear thin as you realize its just a shallow, super simple arcade racer but this game seems to be pressing all the right buttons after a good 5+ hours in.First off, the driving is somewhat physics based, with air time, tires and cones that you can hit that'll go flying or get you snagged up, banked turns that improve cornering... it DOES take skill to make the fastest turns and cuts and a good player will totally rock the socks off a bad one. Then you get the whole Nitro mechanic that can make or break a race if you know when and where to fire one of those off. Second, the graphics are actually quite good, with reflections, dynamic lights and some nice textures for the most part. Some tracks look damn nifty.The tracks combine fun themes, good looks, and good racing gamplay which is pretty much the holy grail. Around 20 tracks with day/night variants as well as backwards/forwards runs. Got a good mix of real fast, short tracks and some longer ones where skillful steering adds up. Really are some pretty cool and fun tracks like Turnpike, Cliffs, Fortress, Aperture Labs, Alpine and Downtown - my favs. I do have to say that'd I'd appreciate some more loooonger tracks as well as off road ones. Think Turnpike but with mud puddles, ramps... like WARIOS STADIUM from Mario Kart 64, haha The cars are simple in appearance but that more or less fits the game - not super silly but not realistic either. Cars have 4 stats that you can upgrade and each car has a different distribution when fully maxed out so they perform differently as well. Some might have really high top speed and nitros but lack in the handleing and acceleration department as an example.Multiplayer works well as I've played a good 40 races that were smooth and fun. There are a few kinks to work out but an actual Developer was racing with us from time to time and he said there was gonna be a patch soon that'll help smooth a lot of it out. Could use a few more features like a 5-6 track points tally game where after the cup is over the player with the most points wins, though.All in all defs worth the 8 bucks I paid for it!

												I noticed just after a few hours of gameplay that my Mini Motor Master achievement bugged and it gave it to me early. What are the odds of that?Beside that, coool little racer with cheesy music. The difficulty steapens fast for long term playability. It does take hours to power up a car and days to max it, which is tedious, but once you can race the end game races the money flows (it takes forever to get there). Love the Valve themed courses, I wish the workshop was full of stuff like that. Worth a sale buy, 3/5.			",225,47,9,21,11,2,25
