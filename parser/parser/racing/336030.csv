												The roar of the engine, the smell of petrol in your nostrils, the blinding sun penetrating the windshield.  You sit behind the wheel of your five hundred thousand dollar race car, a pair of worn black sunglasses (The Rowdy ones) rest half-cocked off your nose.  You rev the engine, hearing it purr like a kitten, the heat raises inside the beast..  You feel trickles of sweat running down your face... No time to relax, it's only time to win, everyone knows ""if you ain't first, you're last"" (Ricky Bobby for the win) Well unfortunately the situation I described above won't be something you'll find in Race.a.bit, what you will find is a pleasant throwback to 80's gaming.  Devoid of all the modern trappings graphically overproduced piles of dung 3d racing games that exist to simply look good but have zero substance.  The simplistic nature of Race.a.bit will be a nice refreshing change of pace.  Kick back, and hit up some crazy tracks with your square or diamond shaped block.  Anyone born prior to 1990 will appreciate the game, people who grew up playing games like Super Sprint.Pro's Awesome throwback to 80's racing gamesAI that doesn't cheatSimplistic and familiar controls for retro gamersGame accomplishes what it sets out to accomplishCon'sThe music...  The need to create a separate account to save your high scoresA minor issue with the timer on races, RecommendationI'll start off by saying if you were born after 1990, you won't like the game and should probably avoid it. (unless you are a fan of retro gaming) Anyone born in the 80's, when A.l.F from Melmac was attempted to eat the Tanner's cat lucky, or you were fighting for your right to Party, or you still think Cyndi Lauper is a chart topper with perfect pitch, you'll most likely love this game.  Playing it really took me back in time, I remembered all those amazing times in the 80's, it was prior to me donning my Hammer Pants and thinking Ice Ice Baby was cool, back when my life was atari and then nintendo, playing old school racing games, trying to beat the high score, trying to show (heck no multiplayer back then, so it was all about topping my brother) my friends who the king of the neighborhood was.So I totally recommend you get this game, it'll bring you back to a better time, a time when video games weren't all about trying to pack cutting edge graphics and sound into the games with the worst possible gameplay.  A time when games weren't released broken and fixed later with patches, and certainly a time when games were released complete and not cut apart and sold back to us in mini pieces..			"

												Race.a.bit has simplistic pixel graphics, awful menu, multiple tracks, and terrible floaty controls. It's not at all fun, not recommended.			"

Race.a.bit is a very simple indie racing game that is fun at moments, but isn't so good overall.If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.What is happening in the game:You are in control of a racing car and you have to complete the available tracks as fast as possible. There are boosts, there are jumps, there are teleporters, and that's just about it.Pros: Music | The soundtrack is not that bad in my opinion. It improves the experience a lot, but it doesn't save the game. There are multiple tracks that follow each other when you play the game. You can also skip the song if you don't like it. Levels | There are quite a few official levels and they are not so bad. There are also a few achievements related to beating the official levels with a good enough time. Level Editor | Race.a.bit also features a level editor, which allows you to create your own racing tracks. The tool is quite powerful and you can do a lot with it. After you complete the track, you can also choose to publish it for other players to use. Your best score at the time of publishing is also set as the gold medal score. Achievements | This game has a lot of achievements. Some can be quite hard to achieve, some of them even cause problems which I will describe in the Cons section. If you are an achievement hunter, most the achievement are doable with some effort. Leaderboards | Every track has its own leaderboards, which allows you to compare yourself to the other players. There are plenty of players listed for official tracks, while the leaderboards for most user-created levels are close to empty, if not completely empty.Cons: Repetitiveness | After playing on 10 tracks, I started to feel a little bit bored. As I try to play the game as much as possible before writing a review, I played on much more tracks, leaving me even more bored. The levels are mostly the same, just the turns are a bit different. After you figure the game out, it's all the same. Apart from getting the achievements, there's really not much fun involved. Sadly. Controls | Controls were really not suitable for a racing game. At times, the controls are waaay to sensitive and it may be very hard to drive the way you want to. Some corners are very hard to do and even the official ghost sometimes struggles on some tracks. Official Ghost Imbalance | On the first few official tracks, the gold time ghost is incredibly easy to beat. It drives very slowly around all corners and it feels like it's not even being serious, as much as a bot could even be serious. Then, at one of the tracks, the ghost starts to driving very very good. It knows all the shortcuts, it never makes mistakes, all of the turns are driven perfectly ... and so on. And then every one in so many levels, the ghost is on the ""newbie"" difficulty again. I don't know what to think about this. Achievement Hunting and Community Levels | One of the achievements requires you to post 20 of your own levels. Can you imagine what this means? This means that the list of community-made tracks is flooded with the shortest possible levels that take a second or two to complete. Every time you look at the newest levels, there is one person who flooded the whole page with such levels. There should be some restrictions when creating levels, such as the length of the track etc., because in the current state, it's not very easy to find a good new level and it's certainly not pleasant to search among those generic levels. Loading Times | For some reason, this game needs a long time to load all the menus. The leaderboards usually take a few seconds to load, same goes for user created tracks. There were a few times where I even needed to wait about 20 seconds to be able to return to the main menu. Cheap Looking Menus | I can't say I'm exactly happy with how the menus look. They could certainly be improved to fit modern standards of good designing.The final verdict:I'm not gonna lie, I did have some fun with this game. However, there were a lot of things which prevented me to enjoy further. The controls in this game are not exactly something to be proud of and that certainly doesn't help this game's repetitiveness. Community level browsers are flooded with generic tracks made by achievement hunters.The official tracks are not that bad, but your gameplay experience may be at degraded at times because of imbalanced prerecorded ghosts you are racing against.This is one of those games which I would love to rate ""meh"" if I could, but this is, unfortunately, not possible. I'm sad that I have to do this as mostly I only review games that I genuinely like, but right now, this will have to be the first game to which I am going to give a ""Not Recommended"" review. I will keep an eye on this game in hopes it will get better, but I doubt it ever will.With love,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review. "

+ Fantastic chiptune soundtrack+ Map Editor+ Tons of user-generated tracks / plenty of content+ Fun short and sweet gameplay + Simple controls+ Leaderboards (this game is great for people who love competiting for times)- Trailer is VERY MISLEADING, as I could not find the levels shown in the game    :(~ I feel like a game like this could really use some multiplayer, would be great to play with a friend instead of a ghost			"

												Not worth the cash.  Barely more than a Addictinggames flash game.  Musics pretty good, though.  Pros----- Cute game play- Some pretty good music- High score list seems pretty legitCons------ Extremely repetitive - Terrible menu layouts- Very cheap; barely more than a FTP phone game			"

												Firstly, ignore the trailer. The game isn't a homage to retro games of old. HOWEVER, that's not to say you shouldn't buy this (after all, it comes with a level designer, go make your own). It's a great top down racer, almost like a 2D Trackmania. The gameplay is solid and the controls responsive. You'll find yourself resetting the track to improve your time and ranking. The name is accurate, you'll race a bit, 5 minutes here and there, but I've found myself coming back to it again and again in short bursts.			"

												Race.a.bit is compareable to visiting McDonalds.While your meal doesn't even come close to what it looked like in the advertisements and you can't tell if the burger was involved in a terrible accident or left the kitchen in this state purposely, it is still VERY enjoyable and you will come back for more......even if it gives you explosive diarrhea the next morning.*Disclaimer: Race.a.bit won't actually give you explosive diarrhea.

												It's been a while since i had fun with a game who do aim ""retrogamers"". As usually they are all the same... But right now i finally found one that can handle most of my needs.Pro:It will remind you Slick'n'Slide but in a good wayMusic qualityIn-game racetrack editor encourages pixel arts which help to give a unique atmosphere to each of our creations.Control intuitivenessCompatible with a gamepadSubtleties of power-ups, obstacles, traps, etc. make this game having a very long longevityCon:Not enough music trackNot enough players which make that sometimes i feel lonely creating tracks for only 3 or 4 players.Duplicata debug display problems are frequent when we create our own racetrack. So we sometimes need to close the game and reopen.

												Pros - - Level Editor and a growing community so ""new"" community made tracks are available often.- The soundtrack and style of the gameplay is reminiscent of the NES days, although not quite as enjoyable.- Controls are fine, played with a controller and all was good. Plays pretty much like the old micro machines games.- If you take the time to learn the editor, there a loads of options to create some really fun and/or difficult tracks.Cons - - First, the price.  At $9.99 USD I feel a game like this is limiting its market access and even though that really isn't a bad price for what is offered, a price point of $4.99 would bring in way more people to look at the game.- The gameplay can get repetitive, so unless you really enjoy the top-down oldschool style, you will likely get tired of this game rather quickly.- Some of the achievements are hurting the game, for instance, ""Upload twenty tracks you created.""  While I understand why the developer would want this to be a thing, in order to create more content in the game, it mostly just creates short, boring tracks from people just trying for the achievement.  Also, many of the achievements are quite grueling to get, as you can see from the low % of people who have actually finished them.- The trailer is quite misleading and really could give people the wrong idea about what this game really is all about.Closing - I recommend this game as someone who enjoyed it and likes the oldschool feel and creativity it offers.  With that said, I would wait for either a sale or a price drop before purchasing.  Also, only buy it if you like this genre of game, don't go into this game thinking its gonna blow your mind.			"

												Maaan!I really wanted to drive my car into those friggin Space Invadersthen Tokyo drift across Pinky and Blinky stupid faces.As I watched the car exit the mario pipe and wreckI knew it was too good to be true.I longed to die in that odd car crash.You may say I am a dreamer but I'm not the only one.Imagine:Driving up the Donkey Kong stageor racing the evil cars causing theamphibious holocaustin FroggerIt is not going to happen here butyou can recreate the scenes and interact with them.The racing is tight and feels just like an old school racer. There are lots of cool features to create your own 2D racer without getting your neck all beardy.Simple and easy to use.Race.a.bit offers hundredssoon thousands maybe millions of tracks...all depends on how hard you work.

												RACE.A.BIT:~~~~~~~~~  Ladies and Gentleman, it’s time to rev up your engine! Are you ready to show your driving expertise and rise to the top of the world RACE.A.BIT leader board? Well, what are you waiting for? Jump in your car and go for the gold and the number “ONE” spot!RACE.A.BIT is a fabulous retro racing game with an excellent and easy level editor. RACE.A.BIT has 20 official tracks to race and the aim is to race around the track (usually 3 laps) as fast as you can to score the prestigious RACE.A.BIT Gold Medal. The first couple of tracks are quite easy but as you progress and unlock the other ones, you will have obstacles to avoid. In addition you will have to deal with different terrains and objects that assist you to go faster or help you to surmount obstacles. If you are extremely competitive (most gamers are), why don’t you try to knock the number one spot-holder on the leader board for each track. That would be a great challenge! Also, you can challenge a friend on a specific track, which is really fun too.The level editor is actually very easy to use and fun. First you choose how big the map is. Then you design your own track (s). You decide where to put the obstacles (bombs, icy road, etc) and place assisting objects. Then, when you finish your “Grand Prix” track, you can test it and change it if needs be. I must admit that my creations were all over the joint, but I had a lot of fun. This aspect gives the game a huge amount of re-playability for yourself and for the community.The controls are very responsive, the graphics represent well the 80’s era. Just great!! Positives:~~~~~~~  -	Great retro racing game-	Fabulous and easy level editor-	Online Leaderboard-	Great game for all ages, fun and addictive-	Achievements & trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~-	Soundtracks can be a bit annoyingThis game reminds me of the game I used to play in my youth - I really enjoyed it!9/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

												Do you think this is another indie pixel race? You are wrong!In this game you can make levels with of their old console games! You imagine?First I has come and played a little bit. The game, like many other games of the same style. Then I began to read reviews, discussion of the game and looked a trailer.I have not yet created a map, but I think it will not be so difficult as to enter into turn 90.Fans of racing from the 90s will rejoice, then you can do anything!
