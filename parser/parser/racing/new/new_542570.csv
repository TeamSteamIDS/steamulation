The primary reason I picked this up was to test out the locomotion.  For those that do not get motion sickness, it's nice to have a variety of ways to play and have experiences other than just teleportation.   In that regard, I like it.  I saw one other review stating this being a good ""proof of concept"".  I would agree with that in its current state.  To me testing out the controls accomplished what I set out to experience with this game.From an actual game perspective, there is a lot of potential but isn't there just yet.  I'm keeping this game to support the developer(s) as I like where they are going with this.  To me this can/could feel like a Mirror's Edge type game in the first person.  From a software standpoint, the graphics are very basic and gameplay is quite glitchy.  Not all people will have the issues I did but for me, getting the mechanics down of the controls I have not mastered well enough for a seamless and completely enjoyable experience as I will need a lot more practice.  Some games I can pick up and go but this one I had a lot of trouble.  It took me over 7 and a half minutes to beat level 2. :)  I only state that as there may be others that find themselves fumbling around and getting stuck at parts without practice.The glitches I experienced were not show stoppers per say as the most obvious one was in the beginning before level 1.  On level 2, I'd often get ""stuck"" on a red pole as the grips would not release when I try to jump off and would take a few tries to finally get it but then fall to the base and must start over.  I'd also find myself launching myself from the red ""rocks"" vaulting up and over the top and having to start the level over many times as well.I see a lot of potential for this game and I'm sure many people who get the gameplay mechanics down will have a blast.  It's a fun experience even if it is short lived.  And for the single digit price point at a cost less than most fast food meals, it's worth giving it a shot if you enjoy motion controlled based games.

								This is an excellent proof of concept. Proposes a very enjoyable method of locomotion. Works on Oculus Rift, but takes a little while to figure out the controls.Could this bee a glimpse of the future of VR movement?			",72,22,6,2,31,0,4

								All of the controls work very well. All bugs are minor and can be worked around. All I can really ask for is more content (and more sliding interaction that mechanic is so much fun). Already best workout in VR of 2017.			",162,26,2,8,13,2,7
