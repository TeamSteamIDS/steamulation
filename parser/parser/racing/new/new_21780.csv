												Driver Parallel Lines is an amazing driving game from reflections, This game has a brilliant storyline and character development. The driving is so smooth and enjoyable in this game that i can just sit back and cruise 1970s New York listening to amazing songs. That brings me to my next point, the soundtrack. The soundtrack in this game is phenomenal, with the likes of David Bowie and War in the 1978 soundtrack plus the Audio bullys and Yeah Yeah Yeahs in the 2006 soundtrack. The cars are brilliant in this game, they are all easy on the eye (especially the Cerrano, Zartex and the Andec) Overall this game is brilliant, it derserves praise. so called 'PRO' reviewers like Gamestop sicken me with thier review calling the story ""flat""			",164,8,25,9,9,1,31

												Driver Parallel Lines is to the 70s what Grand Theft Auto Vice City is to the 80s. Just a hands down fantastic soundtrack to go along with racing and workin' for da man. I thought the campaign story turned out to be really good, although the majority of side missions are pretty weak. The ability to teleport using the map to any location is a really nice feature and takes out the mundaneness of driving long distances. The steering and car handling is a little over-sensitive, but just takes a little patience and practice. For an older game, Parallel Lines has aged fairly well and there's still plenty of moxy left in it--quite enjoyable and certainly a game worth finishing.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												One of the best in the driver series. Was dissapointed when I heard there was a new main charachter but soon got used to it. The storyline is just long enough to be satisfying and the free roaming aspects  are awesome.Pro's - All Cars are fully customizable- Many charachters introduced throught the game- the two different time eras 70's/80's - 00's ( 07/08 ) is an amazing experience especially seeing how  New york changes- Extra game modes such as Destruction derby :)- SOUNDTRACK IS PERFECT Especially During 70/80's era Con's - Charachter controlls are rough and over senesitive - Cops/ police are very annoying / very hard to lose			",18,0,6,1,6,0,1

												So firstly off the bat I should say I have WAY more playtime on this, but I recently bought it on Steam and haven't played that much, so don't go ''OMG u only haev 2 hrs, wtf m8'' on me.So. Driver® Parallel Lines.This was one of the first games I ever played on my computer and I absolutely adored it.It is one of the most underrated Driver games, and I recently even saw some hate on it which was really unecessary to be honest, cus this is one of my favorites from the Driver series.So the price is in fact aswell really low and I think you should get it, cus it's worth it.Now, let's go over the pros and cons:Pros:-Open WorldMeaning you can explore the city of New York, which has neighbourhoods that exist in real life (Bronx,Queens,etc)-A SH*TLOAD of carsAbout 94/95 vehicles in this game, including bikes and cars.-CustomizationWell, almost all (if not all) of the 94/95 vehicles are highly customizable, ranging from 4 (5 in some cases) custom bodyworks with paintjobs (or without) , accessories (tinted windows, bulletproof tires and glass) , colours (4/5 default, also there's an option for custom colors, making it with the ''RED,GREEN,BLUE'' filter), nitrous, upgrades to engines,brakes,acceleration and such (almost like the pre-GTA V, GTA V)-Loads of weaponsWell by loads I mean about 11 or 12. So yeah. Loads.-Vast enviromentThe enviroment is actually giving a sense of life with people doing casual thing such as buying donuts at stands or jacking cars. No NPC police chases tho. Shame.-GraphicsNow yes, graphics. This sh*t looks mighty fine for an '07 game dude, like really good. -CheatsThere are some cheats which can spice up the gameplay. There is the usual godmode cheat, the ''all vehicles in garage'' cheat (same for guns) and it actually kinda makes the game better. About 9/10 great cheats, I think.-StoryNow yes the story is divided into two different timezones. 1978 and 2006.Both offer new vehicles and weapons along with missions. The missions are both fun and most importantly not just stuff to fill the gaps in between the timezones. The cutscenes are quite a bit different from the graphics of the real game but they look nice so I don't really care-Thrill CamSo yea that's a cam which goes into this ''Thrill'' mode and just thrills the sh*t out of my cam. Nifty stuff.-The soundtrackOh the soundtrack. One of the best I've ever seen. Its like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but for your ears. An eargasm.Get it? Get it? Mah f*ck you too then.Cons:-BugsA few minor bugs such as getting stuck on a f*cking lightpost. Nothing game-breaking tho.To this 8-year old masterpiece, I give a 10/10. One of my top 10 games of all time.			",113,9,8,4,8,0,2

												This game is soo underrated, it's so sad you may be more familiar with the sequel Driver: San Francisco, but this game is more than worth a try. Althou, as a veteran of the Driver series you may notice that many of the game content is from Driv3r, like sounds, physics and the entire engine. But that is not a bad thing, Driv3r was a very good game in it's time, it was just pulled down by the fact that it was a kind of a GTA ripoff. Driver: Parallel lines instead goes back to the Driver-roots. This game shines with an well sold storyline with an intensional twist and good drving-physics, in deneral the atmosphere is very believeable. Personally I'd like more cars like the Cerrano with an awesome V8-sound, but that's just a personal opinion. Overall a very good game and a must for all Speed Junkies/Diver-fans/car enthusiasts.

												Great game. I love being in a 1970's New York city. Lot's of sight seeing like the Empire State building, Central Park, Twin towers, Times Square, etc. I was up in Queens wand I decided to park my car by the subway tracks do wait and watch the train go by. As I was waiting people usually walk across the tracks. A few moments late the train came and ran over 3 people while one guy walkedinto the train and died. 10/10 Would visit Queens and get hit by train.			",13,0,1,1,4,0,1

												This game is awesome. Never board whether its in 1978 or 2006. This game is definently is a blast from the past literally. Everyone says this is kind of a GTA clone but heres the facts. Driver games have always been like this since the 1990s. The free roam has always been with the Driver series and to be honest the Driver series has always been great. This game is alot of fun. Car costumizing is pretty fun the races can be fun. The controls are decent just be careful and don't over steer on corners. Theres a good selection of cars and the plot line is done pretty well. Driver games have always had a rather unique story line. This game is well worth the money to buy. 10/10.			",73,5,4,5,4,0,2

												Driver is one of THE BEST game series' ever. I have been a fan since the first driver game ('Driver' - 1999) - that was amazing, and this is too. Parallel lines has a clear cut story with an epic ending. The soundtrack is very pleasant and fitting and will entice you to play longer than you might've done without it. And hey, why would you not want to go around in the eighties with badass guns and cars with 'discobeat' written on them?			",107,17,1,9,13,2,9

												Though i just bought the game, i have played it when it came out on the console when it came out and i will honestly say this is a truly fantastic game thats definatly under rated.  The game when it came out of its time definatly rivaled Gta. Despite not being able to use planes or helicopters it ain't no problem.  The amount of hours just messing about and happy with the meyhem it kept on achiving. The story is fantastic im not gunna lie if you havn't played it before you'll be hooked on it. The damage of the cars is brilliant a good follow on from driver 3 ( yup even driver 3 had boss damage uber old game now!) So the pros are:Thrilling story which will blow your mind. With the era of 1978 and 2006 ( which after completing the game you can swap back and forth. Damage physics of the cars GunsBig map to free roam endless hours of meyhem explosionsfantastic graphics ( yes its 2007, 2007 these graphics were the bee's knees.)tons of side missions ( if i can remember)cheats ( yup kewl cheats)can custom cars!!! ( lotta cars) It even has a spedo in the game!!! Boss songs/ soundtracks ( few are my personal fav's to this day!)The cutscenes are so dam awesome highly graphical! Con's:speedo should not have a limitmore custom options,needs more open spacesno aircraft But if you don't give a toss about the cons like me then go get it its a bargin and im feeling nostalgia!!

												Driver Parallel Lines is a largely forgotten game, and a relic of a different era. It was the unfortunate byproduct of Atari's mismanagement of the Driver series and as a result has largely become forgotten to time.After Driver 3, fans of the series had lost interest in the franchise. And after Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, people had seen the franchise as outdated. In the friendly rivalry between the two companies, Reflections and Rockstar, Rockstar was the definite winner. And the fall from grace can be felt with this game.Parallel lines isn't a bad game at all really. It has a unique premise and for it's time is very impressive. The game follows it's main character TK (an abrreviation for ""The Kid"") through two distinctive time periods, 1978 and 2006. The difference between these two time periods is the selling point of the game, as it takes place in a very stylized miniature version of New York city. Likewise the driving is fairly solid and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing. Where it falls flat is it's production values. Parallel Lines was clearly a much more budget release, reusing the same engine as Driver 3 and only taking place in one city. Likewise the general gameplay isn't that polished and the physics benefit an arcade game more than a non-linear driving game. The on-foot sections also still feel out of place. The story to the game is also fairly muddy, and apart from very good cinematics doesn't hold your attention until the 2006 portion of the game. Where it starts to become more reminiscient of the Count of Monte Cristo. It feels like a game that was released too late, it would've given Grand Theft Auto Vice City a run for it's money in 2002. But by 2006 next generation consoles were out, and the game just couldn't compete with it's competition from 2 years earlier. For it's price, Parallel Lines is a fine game. But it's a fall from grace. The Driver series would never recover after Parallel lines. The franchise was sold off to Ubisoft, which made Driver San Francisco, a purely driving game as opposed to sandbox. Ubisoft ducked out of the race with Rockstar, and unfortunately remained stopped at the start line.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

However here's some reasons why I would recommend the game for everyone.+ Works more than fine with low-end pc.+ Story is good+ Great soundtrack in 70s+ Nice car customizing+ Big open world map+ Lots of sidejobs+ Graphics are playable for a 2006 gameThere isn't many negative things to say about the game but I just think that there should have been more things to do when you're not playing the story for example grand theft auto games.I'd rate this game 7/10.

												The best Driver game in my opinion (Haven't played San Francisco yet.) You play as TK a young man who is new to New York City and meets his hero Ray. Ray gives him a shot at the big time and TK goes into crime. He gets betrayed by his fellow criminals on a job and gets put into prison for 28 years. He gets out and wants to get revenge on those who betrayed him. It's a really good game and you'll enjoy it. A huge recommendation from me.Edit: I have played Driver San Francisco since writing this review and it is now my favourite in the series. This is still worth playing though.			",108,25,1,10,3,1,3

												This is the game to go if you want great driving physics, fun and non repetitive mission design, well designed city layout, tons of side activities, immersive atmosphere and engaging storyline. If you don't want any of these then:1. there's something wrong with you2. you must be fun at parties3. you'll probably find your ♥♥♥♥ taste satisfied with driver san francisco insteadBut if you have played this and want more, then be sure to check out Driver 3, as well as the first and second games on the PS1.

												This game changed my life when it came out. After DRIV3R there was no telling what the long selling trilogy would do next. Being raised on these games through my childhood and being intensely drawn into 70's music and culture, this game was exactly where I wanted to be. You play as T.K. a getaway driver in New York in 1976. The selling point was that T.K. gets betrayed by his gang of robbers and goes to jail and comes out in 2006, seeking nothing but vengeance and being as sharp behind the wheel as ever. An exciting game with a good story, the best driving physics, great music, and incredible graphics during the cutscenes. Watching time pass in the city, the characters, guns and the vehicles, really created an emotional attachment in this game. The car customization is also a great feature that keeps this game driving.			",145,21,1,3,9,1,3

												A lot of people criticise this game and I can not put my finger on why. The immersion is supreme, with two distinct eras, 1978 and 2006, the soundtrack is just amazing in every way imaginable, the cars are great fun to drive, the map is expansive, and the police, while a bit annoying, introduce a challenge to a game finally where the car gets heat and will be chased on sight if you, say run someone over or shoot a car. Your person can get heat too, and a car with no heat will gain suspicion and eventually heat if your person has heat. A good thing about the slight age of this game is the system requirements are lowmeaning I can max this game out at 1080p and get hundreds of frames per second. Great game for people like me who dumped all of their little money into their computer and can't get games now. I got this for $5!			",2,1,2,0,2,0,0

												Hello, So i have played driver for about 15 hours at the time of this review and i think it's safe to say that it's a good game,I will not be comparing this game to other open world Titles because that would not be fair on the game,So this game takes place in New york and a little bit of New Jersey, The map is so big i would often find myself fast travelling instead of driving there, The police in new york are possibly the most brutal i have ever seen in a game if you start speeding and they see you they instantly pull out the shotgun and start shooting, The city of new york is big and stays true to most of the buildings locations in Real life new york how ever the city feels empty and Uninhabited there is nothing special about anything in the city the only thing I stopped my car at was to look at times square and even that felt dull, I should also mention the lack of a Jump feature I often found myself wishing Jump up onto a ledge instead of running around the long way to get up there, also Pretty much in any open world new york based games i play i always want to see the land marks but with this you can't even get to the statue of liberty! ok so now that i have had my little rant  lets talk storyYou play as a guy who's only name mentioned is TK (The Kid) Anyway TK is doing small time get away driving,so he gets hired by slink or otherwise the tut guy and sends TK into the life of hardcore crime, there were a lot of missions that had interesting gameplay mechanics like one mission for instance you have to face against a tank,anyway so *SPOILERS* TK Gets framed and goes to Jail for 28 years *SPOILERS* When he finnaly gets out it's 2006 and he has one thing on his mind Revenge (Because why not) anyway so for the next few missions You're taking out all the people that betrayed you with a predictable plot twist along the way, Now The story racks up to be about 9 hours long but that's all it really needed, you can explore the city for Jobs such as being a get away driver, checkpoint races, ect. Now here's the fun part car Customization, I have Spent a little while customizing my car to be the fastest there is and it really is quite fun speeding through the city Listening to Addicted to speed, SO over all  Driver Parallel lines is a good game the Map is dull and boring and even more so during the 2006 era but it really makes up for it in it's Customization Era changes So i reccomend you get this game But just don't expect an amazing Action packed game of the year			",108,8,2,2,6,0,2

												Note: I'm only recommending this game because it's $5 and even lower than that on sales. I bought the PS2 version when it came out in 2006 and $60 is ludicrous for such a mediocre game. Yes, I'm calling it mediocre, I'm a huge Driver fan, I own Driver 1 for PC and I think I still have my PS1 copy somewhere. I own Driver 2 for PS1. I own Driv3r for PS2 and PC and the same goes for Driver: Parallel Lines. The main problem with Driver:PL is that they've turned this into a GTA clone, which wouldn't be so bad if they'd actually cloned the good parts. Sadly they failed miserably.Pro:+ The city looks amazing and really feels like you're actually in New York. + Two eras, 1978 and 2006, both of them feel different enough and come with new cars and music.+ The cars handle much better than in any GTA game, which is what Driver games are all about anyway.+ The game uses a licensed soundtrack and has some really good songs in it.+ Cars look quite detailed and there's a good variety of them.Con:- The draw distance is really annoying, things will pop into view all the time, PC's in 2006 could've handled a draw distance slider.- The story is pitiful. It makes no sense at times and downright offensive and inane. In 1978 you're a wheelman for hire (though you never actually get paid), in 2006 you're a terrorist who bombs the NYPD building to scare the the guy that ruined his life. Yes, all those innocent people in the building had to die because you want to send the guy that locked you up the message that he's not untouchable. In the other Driver games you're a police officer yourself, here you're a cop killing psychopath.- You're never getting paid for missions, you don't even get a thank you from the people that you do missions for. This forces you to d races and other side-missions so that you can at least buy some ammo for your weapons.- The weapons in this game are clunky and have ridiculous names and design. In the 2006 Era there's grenade launcher that shoots rockets and it's called the ""RPG Weapon"".- The character and NPC models all look awful, don't blame this on the fact that this was a PS2 port, because even GTA 3 had much better looking models.- The game is around 11 hours long. That's not much for an open-world game.Conclusion:I know that there are a lot of cons about this game but for the low price of $5 and less, the pros outweigh the cons.			",461,82,29,83,41,5,109

												The music chosen for this game was perfect. Every single track is excellent. Pure hits! The soundtrack alone is worth what I paid for this game. At least for the 70s era part. The 00s era's music they chose is 95% garbage, but it does make it funny sometimes. New York has been created and rendered exceptionally well. The streets, the alleys, the cars, and all other parts of the environment are nicely done. The day and night cycles also look very nice. The cinematics are also done in a film-like fashion, that involves the player from the very beginning. All characters portrayed are quite interesting, and their voice acting is outstanding. Driver: Parallel Lines has the perfect mood, atmosphere, setting, sounds, and interactions to make you feel like you are truly in the game. Controlling any of the vehicles can be close to impossible without crashing them and eventually making them a complete loss. You will lose control of the vehicles easily. This makes the idea of spending money to upgrade cars you own almost completely wasteful and pointless. The game is extremely difficult. I've had to do missions many, many, many times over until I was successful. The untameable vehicle controls are to blame, in conjunction with the sometimes necessary simultaneous shooting. Repeating many of the missions over, and over, and over gets frustrating, repetitive, and extremely annoying. Often, it is infuriating how unforgiving the game is, with its control and handling issues. The speedometer keeps track of the total amount of miles you have traveled in-game, which is not useful, but pretty cool. Mouse sensitivity in the menus is horrible. Making changes in the settings will do little to make the menus useable by your mouse. Expect to choose menu options with the keyboard. The save system is based on completed missions. So, if you quit during the second part of a five parts mission, for example, you will be forced to start the mission from the very beginning next time you load the game, which is ridiculous. All vehicles take visible damage as you drive around the city like a complete lunatic, with very little care for public safety or your own. The chases and crashes are intense and look straight out of a Hollywood movie. The missions are diverse, challenging, exciting, and agitated even though this is primarily a driving game. Investing money into your owned vehicles and altering them is not forced upon the player, with the exception of one mission. Certainly, if you do buy upgrades, your driving will be temporarily made easier and better, but this is totally optional. Especially because money is hard to come by, and the upgrades or parts are expensive. Spend your money on ammunition instead. Several missions involve precision vehicular platform gaming. This means that you will have to slowly and carefully steer your car on ramps and other on ground structures. There are often hilarious AI controlled accidents that occur throughout the game. Because the missions are so difficult to complete successfully, you will develop hate for your enemies and the police. When you finally defeat them, you will rejoice in glory and relief. If you have much patience, and can forgive the game's excessive difficulty and problematic controls and handling, this is a great game. You will experience excitement, variety, and lots of fun. After the campaign is beaten, several vehicles are unlocked and put into your garage. You are also free to roam New York in both eras and do the money making side missions.Driver Parallel Lines is great.			",1290,338,60,143,146,16,197

												EDIT: Nah, actually, screw it. This game is just not playable as it keeps crashing.I'll refrain from any comparison because the first two Driver installements had so much magic in my eyes that Parallel Lines simply can't compete. So, how does it stand on its own?Rather fine really. It's more of a GTA than a Driver, but it's not a bad thing. Especially when you can drive bikes and helicopters. To this day, the game still looks more than acceptable. I can't say the graphics bothered me, except maybe the face models, which isn't really that important for a driving game.Now the story is kinda usual. You get betrayed and decide to take your revenge. You know the drill. It just works!The OST is absolutely fantastic so long as you stick to the seventies. The modern era OST is absolute garbage, which is rather sad in my opinion. Some great stuff got released that year, why did they solely focus on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ electro?Anyway, let's get to the PC release.The game is pretty much entirely customizable. It supports up to a 4k resolution, you can edit the graphical options and what not, even the driving sensitivity. Which I heartily recommend if you're playing with a gamepad because the sensitivity is a bit too high. Also, I'd suggest lowering the circulation because you simply can't drive any fast without crashing with the default options.BUT THEN. The game keeps crashing all of the ♥♥♥♥ing time. Get out of the garage? Crash. Finish a mission? Crash. Failed a mission and wish to restart? Crash. I could go on and on, but you probably get the idea. Luckilly, the game saves automatically everytime you do something. But still, that perpetual crashing really makes finishing the game a chore.I'd say pick it up on sale, but it's already 5 bucks so yeah, if you need a fix of GTA like, go for it.

												Driver Parallel Lines (2007) is one of those games that tried to infuse additional gaming elements into driving, in an attempt to recapture the magic of Grand Theft Auto III (released 2002!), but end up making a mess of it as there's just too much to do. Adding more varieties of activities, such as motorcycles and such did not help. Driver franchise is about fast and furious driving in the 70's, where muscle cars roamed, and an undercover officer must infiltrate gangs, get cars, deliver hot cars, pursue suspects, and more. Driver: Parallel Lines tried to infuse a GTA3 gameplay into it by letting you get out of the car, jack more cars, and shoot suspects all with GTA like mechanics without dumbing down the car chases and evading police. However, the ""free roam"" it managed to give never quite felt as immersive as GTA3. The controls are twitchy, but responsive enough if you don't collide. It is however, the additional acrobatic elements that made the game into WTF category. After going through a couple tutorial missions where you're given instructions on basic car control, shooting, locking on, strafing, and even shooting while driving, you're dumped in the deep end of the pool and told: go drive around and find some missions to make 1500 for your mechanic Ray. You have $100. Okay, there were three races at the raceway and the basic one will pay $500, but you can only choose one. I managed to drive to the airport and found a checkpoint race... Which is where the WTF came in. The checkpoints are easy enough, until where suddenly there's a ramp, one of the checkpoints was on TOP of the room. Apparently, my car is supposed to be able to do it fast enough so it sail over the top, land on the ramp on the other side, and somehow make a hard right onto next point. Except, my car is not light enough or fast enough to do it. I tried it about 10 times. Yet there is no way to quit out of the mission except going all the way back to main menu. Oh, and if you flip your car? Jump out and jack a different car. But the mission must continue. And yes, you *can* run over pedestrians in this game. Driver San Francisco is a much more interesting game due to the ""jumping"" mechanism. Play that one instead. This one is way too frustrating to play.			",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

												Well, what do i have to say about this game??? It is fun when you can play it, but i have tried for countless hours to play this game without it crashing, i have have tried playing it on 3 diffrent computers, some old, some new, and i have tried to find diffrent fixes, but none of them work. Lets list a few of the instances when your game has a chance of crashing, it can crash when you restart a mission or level, when you go to the main menu, when you boot up the game, when you era switch, or just randomly during a game session. I have no idea why this is happening because i am over the minium system requirements to play this game, and i don't know why there are so little reports of this happening, AND i dont know why this isnt being patched... So if you want to play this game, play it on the playstation or xbox, dont waste your money here...			",70,7,4,1,5,2,1

												Making a driving-based game with ♥♥♥♥ car controls is a pretty risque move.Oh, and slow mouse in menus...it's been ten years, but devs still think it's a good idea. Hint: it's not.			",374,65,25,69,40,5,112

												Fun game until it stopped working right after the warranty expired. Steam Support was absolutely worthless in solving the issue. Will never recommend that any of my friends use Steam, in fact, I will advise adamantly against it. A bunch of thieving ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that think it's cool to crash games after their warranty period runs out don't deserve my money, but they already stole a good bit of it. Good job Steam, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.

												I was suspecting it to work out of the box. Sadly I shouldve known for how old the game was, it overloaded my PC RAM conponents and I had to hard shut down my PC multiple times. I don't recommend the game, was fun on Ps2 but a hard game to run on a PC.			",46,3,0,7,13,0,6
