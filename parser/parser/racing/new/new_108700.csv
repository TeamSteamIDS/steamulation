												I liked the original Death Rally game, it gave you a feeling of beeing submerged in the world of the Death Rally circuit. You started with some wierd kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized (b4$t4rd|z3d, wordfilter lol!) rusty VW-beetlecar with built in machineguns and armorplating welded on to it. The car was crap, and you knew it, but that was the point. After many many races where you sometimes knew very well you had no chance in hell of winning the race, you soldiered on, staying out of harms way of the neo-corvette juggernauts that you hoped of one day obtaining.This game has missed the point totaly. After playing the game for an hour and unlocking cars and weapons, I'm sad to say that this game is not a worthy remake. It's got a cheap plastic feel to it in many ways and here are some examples of what went wrong:You're not at liberty to save money when you repair and upgrade your car after a race. All acquired money has to be spent there and then, therefore it effectively removes the economic dimension from the game, and with that removes all strategy from the game.Gear and cars are not bought, they are collected on the race track as parts and once all parts are collected you get your mines or machinegun or new car. What was given to you will not be valued. Therefore the game is not about upgrades since new gear doesn't come from you spending your resources to get them.Your car has auto-fire on the built-in machinegun, you dont even have to pull the trigger to use the weapon and ammo never runs out. I shouldn't have to explain how wrong this is. There are other secondary weapons though that require ammo and triggerpulling, but thats beside the point.There are some other points that I could make about thats wrong with this game, but what has already been written will suffice. Technically this game might be well made from a programming point if view, the problems is that the designers of the game had no idea what they were doing.			",39,10,0,14,20,0,13

												(Disclaimer: I do probably have nostalgia for the original)It makes me sad to have to not recommend this. I was honestly excited by the idea of the Death Rally game being remade and hopefully expanded. Instead what we seem to have is essentially a mobile game scaled up that has a lot of the words in common with Death Rally but feels like it misses on a few important cylinders.Death Rally was a half race and half car-carnage game and it pulled it together well though sometimes a bit cheesy. Fun could be had as the races really felt like skill made a big difference and timing your mines and machine gun fire to destroy opponents in your way was rewarding though not trivial. Through the game, you got money which you needed to restock supplies like ammo or armor, upgrade your car a bit or buy new cars/weapons.This version feels like the dumbed down iOS port that it really is. Money now only is here to buy upgrades to the car and repair it. The upgrades feel like they make almost no difference in gameplay (except armor which did actually seem to prolong life). But as a racing game, getting better cars or engines did not make me feel like I was going faster. I've read that even the best car with the best engine does not go faster than the initial car an opponent drives in a beginner race. It makes the upgrades feel definitely token.There is also no real money management. In fact, after a race, the game seems to expect you to just spend all of your money since ammo is restocked at the beginning of a race anyway. New weapons and cars are unlocked after collecting a certain number of pieces scattered on tracked on dropped from destroyed opponents. It feels like progression in this game could be substituted for attrition. I remember in the original sometimes being in a bad place because I took a loan I couldn't pay back. This made decisions feel like they meant something. Also, additional objectives in the original again meant something since money mattered. Here, they are a yes/no box you click periodically and see if it works. It feels sometimes like an Office product had a pop up with the title ""Fun"" and boxes that just say yes and no appeared with no real context or consequence to the action.Yes you do advance faster from placing higher, but it still doesn't feel significant enough. After all, winning a race seems to come mostly down to well placed nitro boosts at the end.The destruction of opponents seems like an area where this could shine. Unfortunately, there are things in the way of allowing you to really get the full enjoyment from the experience. Your base machine gun automatically shoots for you (after you add your 1 additional gun upgrade). This feels annoying at best since you have unlimited ammo and it's not always shooting, but you have no control over it. Even better is in-race bonuses (repair, money, ammo) are in boxes that must be shot... so you have  to hope an opponent is in front of you near a box so you could happen to shoot that (and they not just take your bonus) or you waste some of your limited ammo.This is a small gripe, but the in level bonuses do need to be shot and all appear at the beginning of the level. Since shooting can be wasteful and feel a bit random, this means that upgrades you need later are hard to get and running into repairs within seconds of the race starting is common. It just feels like a bad decision. The original randomly spawned them on the track, IIRC, and that was fine. This isn't a realistic game; why must we pretend periodically that it is?Opponents suffer from what a lot of games have with enemies that don't have the same limitations as you. I've mentioned their cars are always fast enough to rival yours no matter what. They also have unlimited ammo in their nicer weapons compared to the 4 shots you get in some of your weapons. This is especially terrible in the deathmatch sections where destroying cars is the goal yet they don't have to worry about ammo limits. Additionally, they have health like you do. When you hit 0%, you explode and are done. When they hit 0%, their health bar flashes... and they continue to race for a while. Some number of shots into them later (or maybe it's time? I couldn't definitively understand the logic but it seemed inconsistant and like I wasted a lot of ammo trying to kill a single target), they will in fact explode. You have no real indicator of when this is going to happen though, so I frequently found myself passing them and hoping to get their drop on the next lap if they happened to blow up. Though they can still shoot you in this state.Speaking about laps, one of the biggest places this feels like a mobile game is in the race length. I'm not saying I need long races, but I do feel like the fact that most races take <=1 minute to complete takes away from my enjoyment. That could just be a preference, though.All this is not to say there is no fun to be had. I was entertained for a while. I could see this being more reasonable on a device without a gamepad or keyboard (I never did get my 360 controller to work with this game) like a tablet or phone where simple games are more acceptable. I at least wanted more. I wanted to feel like I had consequences or choices. I wanted to feel like my ability mattered. Instead, I was watching a nice looking (not amazing by any means, but it does look nice enough... if you don't look too closely at the textures) but repetative and short car chase scene from various movies. Things happen, but the ending never seemed to be directly related.You can get the original for free from Remedy which runs on Windows (re-released in 2009); I feel that is a better use of your time and money			",139,70,0,12,15,1,22

Death Rally is a top-down combat racing game. Arrested for a series of crime and illegal racing, you avoid jail by participating in the Death Rally tournament where you must attract the attention of a murderous driver known as The Adversary.Pros: This is a remake of a DOS game by the same name. You race against six opponents (always including one champion) through desert canyons, frozen strips and urban centers. Maps are pretty varied, and some races will drive the track in inverse, other times you'll have specific challenges or handicaps that keep each race fresh. The money you make is spent on upgrading your car's speed, handling and armor, while additional car models, weapons and equipment are unlocked by finding loot drops from other drivers' wreckage during races. Each car has a different acceleration and upgrade cap, while each weapon has a different attack pattern, damage rating and ammo capacity. The game looks great, only some textures and occasional close-up will show this was ported from iOS. As for the control, it is smooth and spot-on (at least with a keyboard, which is what I used 20 years ago with the original Death Rally). In true tradition of the original game, it has multiple cameos from other games.Cons: Gaining levels and money for your upgrades will require you to race A LOT, and the level variety only goes so far, you might find a certain repetitiveness only fans of top-down racing games will tolerate. There isn't much weapon variety, and as soon as you equip a better weapon, you no longer have any control over you base machine gun. Until you master each race track (in either direction), you'll find it near impossible to win the hard races, even with the most upgraded car and weapon, so get ready to do hundreds of races before you can really excel and start climbing the level rankings. The story is nothing more than an excuse for the setting, the story-based campaign is something you're unlikely to repeat.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!I really enjoyed this game. Although a mobile port, it is still one of the most polished top-down racing games out there. This genre isn't everyone's cup of tea, but if it's yours, I urge you to give Death Rally a try!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												When I first bought this game, I was expecting the same game as original one with better graphics. So my first experience was a huge dissappointment. My memories with the original one was so fresh, so I couldn't see that this one (although shares the same name) is a different game for a different time.In first game your motivation was climbing the ladder to fight with adversary. This game has no ladder, so if you are an old fan, you hate the game from the begining. But this time it is more about cars you have to get ambitious about. Upgrading cars and guns are your main goal in here. Races are faster and harder (in my opinion) than original one. 3 Laps is too short to kill everyone in the game (if you have a new car), so it really takes more dedication to win any race. Graphics are much better than the original one (it has to be after 20 years :) ). Cars are the same (which is a plus :) ) with cool upgrades.Of course  the game has its downs. Like story is not going to get you. Races are too fast. Race ends till you get the idea most of the time. Gameplay is not very smooth. Enemy AI is not very bright. But, in the end, you should see this game as a casual game as it is an adaptation from mobile game. So if you take games too serious it is not a game for you. But if you wanna open a game, make a few race, collect some stuff in your free time, this is right game for you. 9.99$ is a little expensive for the experience, so if you catch a sale (2.99 or less is ideal I think, but 4.99 is not bad too) don't miss it..--PS: If developer reads this; the thing I miss the most from original game is the enemy characters. There are bosses in every race but in the original game as you move up the ladder you fight with harder characters and before adversary you compete with hard characters like duke and sam speed. This time bosses are just normal cars in normal races. If this could be added to game it will be great. (like adding special voice over, small ads for the boss of the game, may be a history and stuff).. Thanks.			",594,255,29,86,76,11,111

												If you're searching for the renewal of the good old time Death Rally you were in love with when you were a kid, just go away, this is not what you're searching for.Not the same mechanics, gameplay only average, background away.In fact, this game took all the good stuff of the original Death Rally, throw it away, then shot at it like it was clay pigeon shooting. Replace the void they made by average stuff they had in stock.Then sell it under Death Rally name.And, in this final game version : repetitive, way too easy, lack of creativity, average gameplay, lack of fun.Don't, just, don't.

It's fun enough. Why its fun !?Because, you can choose to won the race in 1st place in competitive race or ....Kill all your opponent with your weapon. You can let them to overlap you, and wait in the U turn. Place mine and let the Gatling Gun do the work for incoming opponent.

												First off, when I was a kid I played the original, with every possible options and on every difficulty level, etc. So I loved it. Even though I know I have romantic (sentimental?) feelings toward *that* game I wanted to give a chance to the remake but it was still very, very disappointing.Maps are redesigned a silly way so they lost their charm (e.g. ""shortcuts"", ""booster areas"", etc), as well as ""unlocking"" new cars, weapons, etc.This game, instead of giving options for the player on how to spend their money, forces one into dumb achievement and 'on the road objects' farming until the nose starts running...What about the money you earn in the races in the mean time, you ask? Oh, that money? It goes to neverland! YISS, it is lost.Money in this game is nothing you collect or spend. It is just points to fix the car and fill the rest of the bars (armor, etc).So, e.g. want some mines? Good. ""Unlock"" and ""equip"" (otherwise it is free), as soon as you unlocked all the dumb stuff before the mine (like ""shotgun"" as a weapon instead of the auto-gun...).I am saying all the above by not giving a cent for the game, as it came for free with a game magazine. It is sad. Super sad. Even the ""free"" version does not worth playing it :/			",196,36,1,42,24,0,28

												If you were a fan of the 1996 original Death Rally, and are hoping this will be a revisit with nicer graphics, you'll be be sorely disappointed.Remedy have simply changed far too much. About the only stuff it has in common with the original are a few names scattered around the place. It feels like a completely different game which a ten-year-old has modded to add a few references to his favourite game.It's a remake of Death Rally in name only. If it didn't have the Death Rally references, I'd say it was inspired by it and would mildly recommend it. As it stands, however, I don't.If you want to play Death Rally, play the original in DOSBox. You'll be much happier.			",264,70,3,19,40,3,51

												Death Rally is one of those game that gets lost somewhere between ""Hey this is fun"" and ""Hmm, that could've been better..""The game looks pretty solid, but, looks are not everything. As soon as it comes down to the controls you might find yourself a bit lost. Not in the way of not knowing what button to press, bt more like ""Am I this stupid or is the game so sensible?""And to be honest, you won't get an answer.Sure, you need to develop some bit of a ""skill"" to operate your vehicle of doom delivery, but you'll never end up with a ride that satisfies your control needs for a full 100% Maybe it's a design choice, maybe it's lack of understanding or interest concerning tuning final gameplay.Another thing is the actual upgrade and rank gaining feature. It's a bit like with that newer game ""Gimbal"" looks nice sounds cool, need MORE!. Not enough options and not enough satisfaction for the upgrade part of the game.As a single player game it's a middle thing on the lower part. Let's say 6 out of 10 points regarding final concept.3 Months more and $50,000  more would have done a lot for this game. Hmm, that probably goes for most games out there.Anyway, as a bargain price Death rally is good enough. But don't buy this at full price.It's not a game to feel bad about, you'll just don't get what you might expect if you buy this because of a similar movie franchise. It has nothing to do with that.

												Pros: Several weapons, including rockets and a flamethrower. A couple of rulesets, such as Deathmatch.Cons: Far too little freedom, with no money retained between rounds(it's either spent upgrading your current weapon or discarded), etc. Upgrading feels like grinding, as it barely matters whether you do well in races or not. Once you've completed it once, you'll probably never play it again.Recommendation: Look for the original, or find a game that was initially developed for actual gaming, and not for playing on iOS/Android.

												If ever there was a game I would urge people to stay away from, it's this one.I expected it to be mostly like the original. Seeing Remedy Entertainment mentioned as both a co-developer and publisher for this title my hopes that it would capture the magic of the old title were pretty high. But within no-time this game managed to squash all that.Controls are just an awkward mess. I played mostly with controller, where the car follows the direction of your left stick based on your overview perspective, rather than allowing you to control throttle with a button and steering with the left stick relative to the car. Sadly, it doesn't get all that much better with a keyboard.All cars have a tendency to feel like a stick of soap on a wet bathroom floor. You want to go round a corner? Nope, the car is going to stop in its tracks first, then go for a big half circle in the other direction, before turning the direction you want, as if to underline that this is not a racing game. No, this is a shooting game, with cars.Sadly, when it comes to shooting there isn't much fun to be had. The standard weapon is controlled by the player, only so long as you don't have a secondary gun, at which point it starts shooting on its own (why? Not a clue!). While most secondary guns at least look nice, they are not very effective (nor is the standard weapon, to be honest). Sadly, you get nothing more for fighting off opponents that are behind you than 3 mines - per race. Those 3 mines by themselves are, however, only capable of dealing enough damage to take out 1 enemy entirely. Unless he upgraded his armor. So in other words: in order to get rid of opponents there is nothing for it but to drop back and shoot them from behind. Even though you actually should want to be in the front in order to actually - oh, I don't know - win the race.Upgrading your cars, weaponry and obtaining new cars is no longer done by saving up and spending money. Money has to be spent immediately after a race in its entirety on upgrades, or more precisely: towards upgrades, as you probably cannot afford it in 1 go (again: why? Not a clue!). New cars and weapons can only be obtained by collecting parts, by shooting down opponents. Yet another reason not to make an effort to win a race, but rather to fight your opponents.It's almost as if the developers sat around the office challenging each other to come up with gameplay elements that did not benefit the game. In actual fact, I hope they did, because then at least they would have had more fun making it than I did playing it.			",113,28,9,15,15,3,13

												Haven't played the original Death Rally, but the remake is a good game in its own right. Short, fast paced races, 3 car add-ons, 6 upgradeable weapons, 7 maps, and 8 cars. All in all, a decent bag of fun.Sure enough, it's not a triple-A title, and nowhere near as complex, but it can be fun. The short races mean you can play a race or two whenever you have a minute and get back to whatever you were doing. Gets even more fun with a few buddies in online[1] play. Gameplay in Death Rally doesn't offer anything brand new, but gets the basics right. Controlling the car is simple, either via a single stick or wasd, and there doesn't seem to be any problems with responsiveness[2]. Steering does take a bit of getting used to, but in the end is not much different from other console-like top-down racers - after a few races it should feel natural. Main gun auto-fires at any targets dead ahead and within range, and secondary guns/mines/nitro are activated by pressing the corresponding buttons.The visuals in Death Rally are quite pleasing to the eye. Race tracks and cars look good and offer a lot of detail. The garage view (main menu) shows a nicely-rendered model of the curently selected car (with any selected add-ons/weapons visible) and the UI is clean and efficient. All the necessary elements are visible on one screen and laid out without making the screen cluttered and messy. The UI is designed to be controller-friendly (looks tablet-friendly too) so race selection and car upgrades are quick and easy. AI opponents do offer a fair challenge, but that's mostly beacuse they tend to drive slightly better cars. The regular mob racers have decent ""driving skills"" and their cars are slighlty better upgraded, but only up to what's achievable by players. ""Boss"" racers (of which there is up to one per race), on the other hand, tend to drive real well and their cars are often better than anything the player can achieve. While this does make the game more challenging early on it just breaks it in the very late-game -- most bosses will just speed away right from the start, and only generous amounts of nitro (in-race pickups, random chance) can help catch up. The worst example of this is the ""finall boss"" - the Adversary - who can't be beat without constant use of nitro, or a lot of ammo pickups. For the above reason, among others, Death Rally suffers in terms of replayability. Starting the campaign from scratch does not offer anything new, and will in fact play out nearly the same anyway (up to choice of stages). Playing a single campaign is a much better option, especially in small doses. A few races a day can offer a lot of fun and will delay the somewhat broken end-game long enough to diminish its impact. The soundtrack is a good enough generic composition, fits well and doesn't get too annoying or repetitive. Sound effects are good too.			",244,42,12,21,16,4,37

It was somewhat surreal when I heard Death Rally was coming back with updated graphics. I didn't want it to spoil how good a memory I had of the game to begin with. This top-down racing/destruction game was one that truly dominated our Grade 7 computer lab (well this and Test Drive 5). To be honest though, they didn't change a whole lot, which is a good thing.

												Many years ago, I played the original Death Rally for MS-DOS. It was a game that defined my childhood and gave me a lifelong love for automotive combat. High-speed racing, deadly weaponry, awesome music and clear goal- to overcome the demon king of the race, the Adversary. This new incarnation brings all that and more, now featuring cooperative multiplayer and many minor tweaks the orignal lacked, given the hardware limitations of the time. This is the kind of game we could use more of in these troubled times- a game about pure, unadulterated fun. Listen to the Captain,  racer boy. Things can get out of hand real fast out there. Now ride your machine, your motor-war-chariot. Hear it's sublime roar. Strap it, fuel up, reload, and ride out. It's time for death in the fast lane. It's time to race. Welcome back.

												I loved the original, I still sometimes play it. So when I got this on a sale price I could not resist getting it. I have not been sorry at all. It is not the exact copy of the original, but it has kept a lot of what made the original a classic. The handling of the cars is not overly difficult, but just so that it is not to easy. I love the fact that you don’t have to be in front to win when your weapons are well upgraded and used in the game. One feature I do miss is how you pick the venue and then you can see who is up to race and then you can decide if you want to race. So if I could ask for one chance that would be it. All and all this is a fun game that can be played over and over again.			",8,0,0,4,5,1,6

												I have played the earlier DOS incarnation all the damn time when I was younger. It was one of the best rally-type games, and, in a personal matter, it still is. Every day, I see all these rally games via Flash game sites, and it never met my standards (comparing to the DOS game). With this newer version, I find it as fun as the original. To be frank, however, it's a bit more casual, as you don't have to worry about losing lives or anything. Within the first few hours, it's an easy achievement grind for the hunter in all of us... at least for me anyway. If you're a fan of rally games, or have played the original, get this.

												What I like: Racing, designs of the cars, the selection of weapons, especially the flamethrower, and the game looks nice.What I didn't like: Not as gritty as the original Death Rally, and having to spend all your earnings on upgrades and repairs.My recommendation: Going into this one expecting the classic may lead to disappointment, as a combat racer on its own, I'm having a blast with it. Nice for some casual racing.			",67,5,8,2,5,0,5

												If you don't want to read the tl;dr below I'll sum up this game like this: ""Race, Kill, Upgrade,"" rinse and repeat all over without emotion until you win.First of all It's a fun/good game in all matters. If you buy this thinking about the good old times of the 1996 version then you might get a little bit dissapointed. The depth of story and mechanics lacks short and if you though racing was about winning... Well in Death Rally it's all about staying behind and killing people to get parts to the next car.There is no actual difficulty settings, as you can get in trouble by the first tier of vehicles when you already have a fully upgraded top car. Killing cars is also a bit more annoying as you never know for sure how long will it take to finish one off.Game is indeed fun an all, but lacks emotion when comes to important aspects. Fans of the first version of the game will be sad to think this is the best they could make, and I'm glad I bought this on a sale because at full price I'd be a bit more sad. ",48,9,2,2,2,1,5

												Death Rally is a port of Remedy’s 2012 iOS racing/destruction game of the same name. I picked it up on sale for $3.50 and it’s proven to be a good value for the money. The mechanics are absurdly straightforward, the story is so shallow that it borders on pointless, and yet the upgrade system redeems this arcade racer and turns it from something tedious to something genuinely fun and engaging.The story, such as it is, is that a Joe Arpaio-type sheriff arrests the player, a young punk, for some driving-related mischief and, rather than putting him in a pink dress and sending him to pick up trash along the highway like any normal insane Arizona law-enforcement official, he recruits the maverick to challenge other ne’er-do-wells to deadly races in hopes of luring an archcriminal known as The Adversary out of hiding so that he may be captured or killed. That’s basically it. The story plays out through a total of three cutscenes interspersed among the story missions, which are unlocked as your fame level or upgrades are purchased.Non-story gameplay consists of selecting from among a group of seven randomly-chosen tracks/difficulty levels or playing a challenge mode race, which generally has a specific objective or vehicle/weapon loadout. If you don’t like the options provided, you can always click the “story” button twice and the computer will present you with a new batch (I personally preferred the “Pit” track because it’s the least twisty and I’m not very good at these kinds of games).Winning or losing races will grant you varying levels of financial rewards which are used to purchase upgrades. There are six primary weapons to unlock and select from (not counting mines) and each vehicle has three characteristics to enhance (speed, handling, and armor). You get more money for killing your opponents or placing better than sixth (each race features five AI opponents).Graphics are about what you’d expect from a top-down racer in 2012, neither spectacular nor underwhelming. Sound effects are serviceable and the cutscene voice-acting is atrocious (on purpose, I suspect). The music is limited to what you hear in the main menu, apart from one Poets of the Fall track that plays over the end credits (Remedy must have a long-term licensing deal with that band, as their music was all over the Alan Wake games).The game is not without its quirks. It will not load in fullscreen by default at your computer’s native resolution, which means you have to take the following steps to resolve this: go to the Settings menu, change the resolution to something lower-than-native, click the “Windowed” button to “No”, and then change the resolution to native. This would be a very trivial point if the game remembered your settings between sessions but it doesn’t, so you’ll be doing this every time you load the game. Your alternative is to play in a window but I wouldn’t recommend it; given the amount of frantic clicking that the gameplay demands, you will inevitably click outside of the window, thereby losing the race for yourself and after you do this a few times, you’ll give up and resign yourself to the above process. The PC controls for the mouse and keyboard work but they’re not great; as with most racing games you’ll want to use a controller and you’re best off with an XBOX controller (unless you enjoy fiddling with things like MotioninJoy). As with many PC games, the controller configuration is very limited and it doesn’t work very well at all with my Logitech Rumblepad 2, although I can generally get the Rumblepad to play well with other racers like Burnout Paradise.On the whole, though, it’s curiously satisfying to upgrade your vehicles and weaponry and kick ♥♥♥ in random races, which is the essence of this game. I put 13 hours into it, beating the story mode (that Adversary is a tough nut to crack) and getting most (84%) of the achievements in the process; you may get some extra value out of it if you enjoy competitive online multiplayer modes but these generally aren’t my bag. I can say it’s well worth buying, especially if you nab it during a decent sale.			",493,326,17,119,88,8,165

												It is a remake of a 1996 game which was quite long ago so making a comparison would be pointless, I think. And while the remake - according to many claims - could be different or even ""dumbed down"" it still has many hours of fun in it. The game looks good, plays well and offers hours of fast-racing carnage. Also, there are not many top-down car racing games out there on PC.While somewhat repetitive, Death Rally is a fun game, so grab it with your friends once on sale!			",369,81,4,31,22,3,33

So, the story is pretty nonexistent most of the time, but it's there. The gameplay is fun and fairly satisfying most of the time. However, in later stages when your car is maxed out and you know what you're doing, it gets really boring as you just get ay ahead and you just ... turn. Te graphics and sound are okay. Everything starts to look pretty bland and you start to tune out the sound, but ... oh well. Pretty solid for a mobile port and a remake of a game from 1996.			",1264,476,34,165,92,14,156

												I have mixed feelings about this game. On the one hand its alot of fun to race and blow all your opponents up but on the other hand it can get frustrating to get shot at all the time. I have really enjoyed this game from start to finish even though some of the achievements are nuts and hard to get. The thing that was frustrating for me was the game never fully going in to full screen mode. The option is there but it would never do it for me. The gamemodes can get repetitive at times if you are trying to grind away at kills and other things. The nice thing about all the achievements is that you don't need to play against a live human to get some of them. The ""Online"" play can be done with bots, and the achievements for ""Online"" can be done just like if you were playing against the computer. The cars can be customize which is a nice feature to have. The controls can feel crazy at first but with some practice you can get really good at fully controlling the car. If you like a full on shooter/racer game then this is the game to get. I mainly got it because I thought the achievements would be easy to get and for the most part they were, but some you will need alot of patience to get. I would say get it but make sure you get it while its on sale, then you will feel like you got your monies worth.			",3024,1130,139,313,428,33,475

												At first the controls are horrible... but if you update the handling points of your car it starts to actually do what you want it to do. And then... then the retro feeling kicks in. I loved the original and I fell in love for this remake too. Just one more race, only one. Okay, that one too. And maybe another one. Is there time to do one more? The not so great parts is the difficulty of the ""last boss"" and the requirements of the last achievements. That's where it starts to get frustrating and repetitiv. But even if I have to talk me into start the game again to do the same races on the same courses all over... once I'm in I can't stop because there's just enought time for one more race.

												I'm recommending the game because, after all, it's still mostly enjoyable top-down racing BUT please do not misunderstand: if you played and enjoyed the original, like me, this remake is not ANYWHERE near as good.Let me summarize:The visuals are effective - not great, but good enough. It's obvious that this game was first released on iOS and you can clearly see that the developers did NOT bother to increase the detail on the models (textures might have been improved, hard to tell, but the polygon count is very visibly low). Cars like the Deliverator definitely don't look as cool as they used to in the original, but that's subjective I guess.Music and sound effects are bare minimum. Music was never a strong point of Death Rally so I'm not too bothered by the rather generic, boring and colorless rock tracks they put into this new version. The sound effects are okay, nothing to criticize too much here.The biggest issue, to me, is the way they changed the in-game economy (ie. the shops - everything you did between races). In the original DOS game, you had the (legal) shop and the (illegal) black market. You had money and you would make important decisions what upgrade or car to save money for. This was a big part of playing the game and the separation between the clean shop and the dirty blackmarket (where you'd get all the good, ie. illegal, stuff) also added a very nice and grimy aspect to the game. Well, they removed ALL of this in the 2012 release. Now you don't even really have money anymore. Sure, you collect dollars but then, all they do, is fill up 'upgrade bars'. It was amazing to be able to safe cash to finally get to buy that amazing and mysterious Deliverator in the original - now cars don't even cost money anymore! You just unlock them by collecting parts on the race track! Now you just click on the armor, handling or speed bar and it fills it up automatically with your money. That's it.The fact that they completely omitted the black market is also indicative of another change they made: the atmosphere, the vibe of the game, is now very typically iOS orientated. This new game is almost family-friendly while the old one was dark and, well, just plain cool. The writing used to be excellent, in my opinion, really putting you into that oil-stained illegal street-racing, loan-sharking, drug-collecting world. The new version you're buying here is bland and clean, almost sterile. The writing is bad (literally: there's a lot of typos and language errors in the game) and colorless. Even the interface is generic in its 'brushed metal' look.Another annoyance is the length of the races. Once again, there's the iOS influence. The race length is between 30 and 50 secs average. It's often times NOT enough to kill opponents and it's definitely never enough to actually get 'into' a race. This is clearly designed to be played on mobile Apple devices on breaks, in the bus or on the train.There's definitely more issues that set this 2012 version behind the original DOS release but those are the main points of frustration to me. However, as I said above, after all's been said and done, this is STILL enjoyable. The actual gameplay is, despite some flaws, still the same good old top-down driving, shooting and killing fun. I bought this on sale for less than two Euros and, for that price, it's a no-brainer must-buy, no question, I would however regret my purchase had I payed full price for it.			",125,30,1,5,13,2,13

												Bad phone game port charged at 10 times the price. Might look fun from the screenshots but this is not the classic death rally, at all.  Races are over in a minute, sometimes less, gamepad controls are atrocious and can't be reconfigured (instead of proper racing controls the car just goes the direction you point your thumb stick, wow...), no control on your weapons, they just autofire when drivers are in front which is incredibly annoying since you can't shoot item crates most of the time.  On top of that the game is missing a lot of features and is generally dumbed down from the original.  Also, they took out Duke Nukem. Srsly ...  Also no sense of speed at all in races and i hate how they did the car damage for AI drivers. at 0 life they get invulnerable for a few secs before they can be taken out, ugh...I bought this blind upon seeing it show up on Steam, do yourselves a favour and read a bit more reviews ect before deciding if this game's for you.

In the original Death Rally if you get the last car you r moving so fast Beetle Cars can't beat you and not only they can't beat you but you can run over them twice if not more , The only thing that is better in the Remake from the original Death Rally are the graphics... The Remake require a Big Update that make a big different between the cars you own , In the Performances of each car and In the Performances of weapons on each car ,like firepower... In the original Death Rally , Beetle cars didn't had the firepower of the last car or 2nd best car... The Remake is alot shorter than the Original Death Rally...

												It kinda worth the sale price if you have some history with the 1996 version of this game. I wouldn't recommend it to new players though.It's a rather boring race game with few tracks and half of these tracks are not enjoyable to play because of tight curves. Full upgraded cars don't make you overpowered, even against lower level races, so winning a race (or making money for upgrades) is rather luck for getting the right items from boxes than skill or hard work. Also, you can restart any race without penalties, which make the game less challenging. This would make this a neutral review, but there is something that make the game worse. You can't beat the story mode. The game crashes when you beat the last boss and the story, which is not even a good story, has no end. 4/10 for 90's players, 2/10 for newcomers.			",57,17,0,4,7,0,4

												The intention to revive this game was good, but i think they could do better. Few cars and just half dozen tracks. You get bored quickly. But the thing that drove me nuts is the fame level. If you don't play regularly, it will drop to zero. And the game don't even warn you. It's almost like you have to start all over again. What gets worse is to achieve the top fame ""The 42"" you must have 42.000.000 fame points, which is almost impossible for PC version (on mobile you can buy with real money multipliers upgrades).Thus, there's multiplayer achievements that is difficult to get just because people get bored so quickly that nobody plays online.So, have to play a lot so don't lower your level while trying to get to the top and no multiplayer to try to shake things up a bit, THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE!

It's a fun little game that'll keep you busy for a bit, but you'll only be able to play in single player mode, because NO ONE plays online. I've tried many times, and its not recommended to keep online mode on in this game because you'll lose the ranking you get working your way up in story mode.Its not worth the $10. Now, while I haven't played the original or mobile game, I can say this version of the game sucks. I give this game a 3.2/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Death Rally is yet another indie game that I want to like, but find myself feeling unentertained and even frustrated while forcing myself to play through the campaign. The arcadey driving is overly simple with hand-cramping controls that lack finesse required in good racing games – even arcade racing games. The RPG element is weak but somewhat addictive. The multiplayer is basically uninhabited and limited to random online-only matches; sorry, no beer-fueled buddy matches. The story is trite and drawn out via ridiculous story-mission level requirements. The only reason I put as much time into this game is because of nostalgia, since Death Rally’s gameplay was 100% lifted from the NES classic R.C. Pro-Am. Overall I say avoid buying Death Rally, which is a shame because it only needed a few things to make this a great game, namely: playable multiplayer, better controls, and deeper RPG / customization choices.

I recommend this game to all that love racing and destroying and shooting in the same TIME and GAME.			",82,3,10,2,2,0,18

												Stick to the original. This attempt at a reboot is horrendous! There's too much emphasis on power sliding (even with handling maxed out), and the enemy's stats scale with difficulty. The original was great because the progression was consistent and you struggled to break the power curve, the point at which you become a serious contender. There are 3 things I absolutely loathe about this one: Poor handling, poor progression, and ridiculous ""hidden"" enemy HP. In the original, as soon as the life meter ran out, cars blew up. Here, they enter a ""red, flashing danger"" mode and continue to take extra hits before getting knocked out. This puts the emphasis more on the racing, while the original gave you total freedom. Stay away from this one!			",247,33,1,38,27,2,27

												Mediocre game, the racing part is poor and the shooting part too.I didn't expect an accurate simulation for the driving model, but even for an arcade game it is below average.+ neat gfx and layout, unfortunately that's pretty much all.- poor sense of speed or acceleration, even with Nitro boost- average control, the game use absolute direction ( instead of relative to your car)- driving doesn't requires much skills, so you don't get any satisfaction.- only 8 tracks, - the ""massive"" campaign is only 7 races longs (less than 15 min)- What is really massive is the excessive grind required (smell mobile game)- dull gameplay, if you try to race from the 1st place you'll get destroyed by the opposition, best tactics seems to start from behind and kill as much opponent as possible, then use Boost to try to take the lead in the last turn.Not so fun.There are much better racing games around. It is a mobile port and is just below average for PC			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Though without a lot of the personality that made the original game such a favourite of mine.Some of the weapons and abilities don't seem as useful as others.

												Death Rally has been lovingly re-created and provides the same high intensity arcade adrenaline rush as the original but with full HD support and updated sounds and visuals.  There is something satisfying about destroying all your competitors in a nail biting race to the finish.  Miniature cars that can have armour, weapon and handling upgrades.  On track arcade bonuses a-la Super Sprint.  Some races have more Death than Rally but that is where the fun lies.  Kill competitors, buy upgrades, kill more competitors, buy more upgrades, then leave them choking in your dust.  Regardless if you are new to this game or getting it for nostalgia value, Death Rally will provide many hours of fun and enjoyment.			",355,35,40,87,58,1,118

												Death Rally is a top view racing game. The story is very minimal and a majority of the game is completing various, random races in order to earn cash, and upgrade your vehicle. There are a decent variety of vehicles to choose from and vary your strategy in the race. In this game you will have to get used to some repetition in order to obtain enough money to get a ""golden"" vehicle.

												They have killed the fun so i can´t recomend the game. The old one was challenging as  you had to win every race if you want to unlock new weapons, get better positions on the general scoreboard and get new and fast cars. It was the kind of racing game that made you feel proud when you win and mad when someone kill you in the last lap.If you want to revive the experience this game is not for you. Why? Is really easy to win, and there is no point for doing it. You can just get new cars and weapons by killing your opponents and picking the parts they drop, and that is very boring. So there is no challenge, there is no fun, just an ""meh i´m gonna play it"" game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In most games when you die, you restart with full life. Not in this game. You have to spend the money you earn in races on fixng your car up. Doesn't sound like much of a bother, unless you die a few times or finish fifth and don't earn much. I spent all of my money from one race just fixing my car up. Then I turned down a sabatage offer, and I guess they sabataged my car instead, and I exploded before the race even started. I already had no money to start with. So I get $100 for participation, which lets me fix my car to only 10%.You can't be in lead because you will always die at 10% life and staying in the back for five races just to get enough money to fix it 100% just to repeat the process is just too much for me.

												Within 15 minutes of playtime it becomes obvious that Death Rally was originally an Ipad/Iphone game. Following the story and having finished the available missions I would think that more tracks/missions would unlock. But that was not the case. There are about 8 tracks, and they are randomized every time you have played a level. The tracks remain the same, the objectives change from time to time though. These objectives range from killing certain boss enemies, racing a few laps, killing everyone in some sort of arena, etc. With the money you make you can upgrade your vehicle and weapons. During races you'll collect random parts of vehicles and weapons as well, and killing enemies always grants a certain part.But... the game is just so dull. You can tell it was meant for smaller devices. The graphics have been upgraded though, and other control schemes have been implemented as well, so it is a game worth having; just not for the full price.[Rating: 57/100]			",1655,629,69,221,194,16,225

												I give this game a preliminary rating (because I have not finished it) of 1.5/5. Awful. I got this game thinking, 'how bad can it be?' I loved the original Death Rally game I thought this would give me some nice nostalgia. Well this game isn't hardly nostalgic at all. The vehicles are wayyyy too hard to control. I know it gets easier as you upgrade them but the music is so bad and generic that I wonder why I would want to. This game is also extremely hard and I don't see why I should play this when there are so many other (and better) games to play.			",171,24,2,6,7,0,17

												The English language is insufficient to fully describe the atrocities this game comprises. It is an abomination in the eyes of God.You look at a screen. You aim with a mouse. You shoot cars. You race cars.Their pixelated corpses fly comically through the air. Sometimes the cars are close. Sometimes they’re far away. This isn’t racing, but mental exercises in learning to keep a floaty polygon block (referred to in the game as a “car”) on a flat and blurry texture map (or “track”) long enough to reach the first curve. At which point, the oversensitive controls, nonexistent physics and spotty collision detection will invariably send your polygon block lurching wildly into the fuzzy green texture sometimes known as “grass.” Start over.“Stay one step ahead of the law”? The game didn’t ship with police included.“Race your modified car”? It also forgot to ship with actual racing opponents. “5 different tracks”? When you try to load the fifth, the game crashes…“Non-stop driving”? Sometimes, when starting a race, the outstanding game engine believes you’ve finished and rewards you with a congratulatory screen after five seconds. Genius!Failure and embarrassment. From a player’s perspective, Death Rally is an absolute mess.The controls suck. The graphics suck. The music sucks. The multiplayer sucks.Take whatever expectations you’d usually have for a piece of advertising for a Shovel and lower them by a few hundred percent. Tetris is a masterpiece in comparison.There are some good things about this game. There’s multiplayer. It doesn’t work [but] there’s a multiplayer button on the main menu.One being…that you can quit at anytime. No, wait you can’t. In fact, Death Rally crashes your computer everytime you try to quit.To be fair, there was a comic book… created by the same people as the game, though, and published before the game’s release as obvious promotional material.The comic book contained +18 scenes.Clearly, the designers were too focused on the comic book than on proper programming.But hey!The programmers used only their left hand to create the game, what'd you expect?-Miyuki 2015			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Featuring an isometric camera the game lets you keep an eye on everything whilst making it easy to lineup weapon shots, besides the races the game lets you customise your cars with upgrades and weapon selections adding a slight level of depth to what is otherwise a casual game. With a low entry price and simple gameplay mechanics, this is a great game to play if you want something to wind down with.			",109,15,4,18,7,0,12

												Like the original Death Rally, this game is all about short bursts of play and upgrading your car / weapons on the way. However missing in this new version compared to the original is the ranking board, pedestrians (no blood in this version), good music (albeit this can be changed to your own tracks I believe) and the option to choose your own sabotage on your opponents in the store. It also would've been handy to save up money as you will need to spend everything earned after each race. (even if your current car is fully upgraded, the money is lost in that case)All in all I still like the game alot, even tho it's been a bit toned down.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Guns + cars = perfect combination!In my opinion, Death Rally is one of the best top-down racing I've ever played. It has a great length of story gameplay, a nice variety of tracks, plenty of different modes, such as specific cars, marathons, head-to-head, and much more.The only thing that is quite disappoiting is the online matchmaking, because it takes a really long time to find players, even in a private match.

												I loved the original Death Rally.  I posted many hours playing the game with friends over LAN.  When I saw this on sale a year or so ago, I gobbled it up.  Unfortunately, I did not do due dilligence to see how the game works.  Instead of earning money and saving to buy cars/upgrades you are forced to find the parts in maps that you play.  I kept trying to get into the game, but at the $5 or so I paid for it I don't want to spend any more time with it.  The graphics are nice, and the explosions are fun.  The items to destroy on the maps are great, and add some excitement.  It is auto fire, which might be able to be turned off but still turned me off.  I mostly didn't like the career mode, but if you didn't play the original it could be fun.  I wouldn't recommend it based on what I was expecting.			",106,18,1,14,9,0,7

												I have fond memories of the original Death Rally from the DOS era. With that in mind, I have mixed feelings about this remake. It wasn't really a bad game, but I have a few issues with it. I didn't like how you had to spend all your money after a race. I didn't like how you had to collect different resources for different unlocks, because that removes your choice in favour of a (sort-of, but relatively even) random element. I didn't like that nitro cannot be bought before a race (I'm not really sure if it was like that back in the old days though). This particular design decision turned me away in the end: you have no way of preparing for the last match, it all depends on your luck of finding nitro/ammo in the boxes.In the end, it was fun, but come to think of it, I didn't really enjoy the races either, I only did them to progress with the cars and upgrades... So, in short, I wouldn't recommend this.			",154,53,0,30,8,0,12

Summary[/h2]
Really, it's a pretty good game, and the gameplay is fun, but it's nothing compared to the original.  It's got some glaring issues in immersion and progression that other reviews have pointed out, so I don't recommend it.  However, I recommend the original, and it's free on Remedy's website.

So here's what I suggest you do:

												A couple of years ago the masterminds at Remedy Entertainment released a revamped version of their old classic racing game: Death Rally. Once I started playing it I had incredible difficulties to quit it until I beat it. The driving and purchasing upgrades and weapons was super fun! There was a story mode but I guess I didn’t get how it worked. I just played the regular races until I was at the end and then I got a picture of George Lucas talking some smack at me. The game is really fun but repetitive. It’s also quite easy except for the end boss that is extremely difficult. I don’t know if I really appreciated that but I beat him so that’s all that matters at the end.			",449,113,17,63,51,4,101

The AI is rarely challenging, and when it IS challenging it seems like that stems entirely from being given unfair advantages.It's a fun game to kill a little time in, but not really worth $10.

												Death Rally will set you back $10 normally, and $5 on a discount sale which is still $3 more in quarters than I would have put into it if it were sitting in an arcade cabinet at the mall. Yes, it's fun in an old school mindless fashion with your little car racing around small repetitive tracks but due to the mechanics and swimmy control input you can't really ""race"" in any proper fashion so killing the competition is the only choice to get ahead.  Frankly, the controls are weak even when using the must-have gamepad controller.  You're never seriously penalized for coming in second or even last place, you just get less money awarded to you for the purchase of upgrades to your guns and car performance, and you can't carry the money over between rounds to help in purchasing the pricier goodies.  Sadly even when you do upgrade the results don't feel like a significant improvement.  Graphics are passable while the sound quality is merely functional; neither have flair or panache.  The game tries to create some personality in certain key opponents you face off against but they come off as cookie-cutter archetypes and pose little more challenge than the basic racers which ends up making them boring.  Boring and uninspired gameplay is really the biggest drawback to this game.  I played for 3 hours total and during that time I was able to fully upgrade 4 cars and the gatling gun weapon and once I got to that level I realized I wasn't have any fun and none of the other upgrade levels were going to get any more compelling and I called it quits.  Death Rally was a fun diversion but completely forgettable and only worth playing during a free weekend.  Save your time and money and go buy Renegade Ops instead as that game handles this approach to automotive combat a thousand times better.			",385,63,18,9,25,1,53

												It's a smartphone port of a  remake of a '96 game, so don't expect a whole lot of depth. There's a really simple driving model, and everything is based on grinding. Unlocking new cars, new weapons, new tracks, new upgrade levels, -new story missions-, it's all  running races for money and unlock chits from blowing your opponents up.However! It's really stupidly fun, even when you can't drive for beans and never place well. The tracks are short enough that you can run a few laps in a few minutes, making it easy to pick up and put down when you've got a few minutes to (ahem) kill. Races with special conditions, and requests for bribes to sabotage opponents and sneak peeks of later weapons help to shake things up, though they're definitely uncommon.			",328,171,5,50,21,4,59

												Not a bad purchase. I grabbed this as soon as I saw it just because of nostalgia, the original death rally is one of the best games i have ever played. It would probably still be fun to play today, and i recommend you check that out also. This version has upgraded graphics, and lasts about 5-8 hours max to beat on single player and get 99% of achievements. Multiplayer is supposed to extend that time, but so far there are no other players... you just keep waiting for other people to join and they never do. This game has less character and a bit less snappy controls than the original, but nonetheless it is good value for the price and I do recomment it.			",360,75,5,72,42,2,66

After you get to the snow mission in the story section, you can keep replaying it to unlock and upgrade everything (you win about $5k a pop, and since its 5 laps long its easy to just kill everyone on the track).

												I started this on the free weekend and was surprised that I liked it enough to buy it.  The formula is simple.  Race 3 laps that last about 1 minute total, kill everyone or try to place 1st, get money, unlock new weapons, unlock new cars, upgrade cars, upgrade weapons, try to get all of the 87 achievements.  Very fun and easy to play in short doses.  Not much online community though.  Probably less than 10 maps, but I never got sick of them.  It's more about trying out new cars and weapons and trying to kill everyone!			",733,175,23,71,37,7,90

												This is the only smart phone game that I really enjoyed on the iPod Touch. So when I saw it on steam I was on the premise that it was going to be a really bad port, kinda like Deus Ex: The Fall.But I was wrong, it's the same damn game, but with performance improvements, because on the iOS games, they always make them lag like a ♥♥♥♥♥ to make you buy a new iPhone or something.The level of care they put into making this the best damn game ever. Great fun.Asking price is a bit steep, so wait for a sale. This is a $5 game at best.P.S. Doesn't this remind you of that movie Death Race, even just the story.*Edit: I wasn't aware of it being a remade game, so this is the only one I have known about.			",124,10,7,10,14,1,6

												This is a fun pick up and play game with an okay amount of customization but no shortage of unlocking and endless replayability with all the different vehicles and weapons. This game also supports a controller even though it doesn't say so on the store page. I play with an XBOX ONE controller and I can say without a doubt they work and the controls are good but cannot be remapped for the controller, but you can remap keyboard keys. Also when using a controller you can switch easily between the mouse for choosing races and editing cars but you don't necessarily have to as the controller works very well throughout the menus.

												Really fun racing game has plenty of customisation as far as a racing game goes, has a decent amount of races that if you're able to unlock the right weapons can be easy to win because you're destroying the other racers cars. The visuals aren't great but they're ok the audio as far as a racing goes is ok, I think I beat this game in like a day so it's not hard haven't tried it on hard beat on normal though and that difficulty was at least for me made the game not to hard but not to easy either so there was enough of a challenge to make it fun but it wasn't so easy that it was aggravatingly  hard so that it wasn't fun.

												Small, fun to play racing game with guns. Nothing like original, but fun in its own way.Steering could be better, opponent AI could be better (there's no real AI, it all depends on difficulty and on harder races they'll turn you into dust on lap 1, and lose horribly on beginner level).Races typically last around 1 minute. Powerups are contained in boxes, some boxes have more health than cars and you can't directly aim at them, while most get destroyed (opened) in 1-2 hits.Overall, the game is fun. Just don't bother trying to get 100% achievements, its quite long and boring.			",139,21,6,26,5,2,21

												Remember the original game by 3DRealms? Will this stand up to the classic? No not really. But for the price I paid, it was worth it. While it has some of the elements of the original, it is a completely different game. Did I have fun? Yes. Is it graphically awesome? No. Does it have a decent story? No, it’s horrible. Replay Value? No.I would suggest getting this game when it goes on a cheap sale as it takes about 8hrs or so to bust through it. For fans of the original, don't go into this game with expectations as you will be disappointed.			",214,25,4,22,25,2,45

												Although a lot of people find this a dreadful game, I played the original A LOT back in the days.It doesn't have that exact same ring to it, but it stays a good game. Just like the original, if you put some effort in it you can outplay the single player campaign in a few hours. It's a bit short, but I had my fun.The upgrade system has become better and the graphics are very nice and maintain their craziness, like the original game (huge explosions, a bit over the top, but this is fun).+: good single player, but a bit boresome after you finally have your pimped out max car.+: good fun for spending some time+: good graphics-: no players found online (to be expected obviously, it's not the most played game on Steam)-: a bit boring after you max out your car-: a bit short single player campaign.All in all: a good game, especially to be recommended to people who played the original.
