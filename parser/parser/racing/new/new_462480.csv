								This game is more of a prototype with barely one level complete, no way to actually launch it from the vive. I can't see how the developers put more than 2 days into this current build. Charging money for this is ignorant.			",550,129,12,67,67,10,105

								A full priced demo. You simply ""move"" the entire level, using your hands. Sure, there\'s a bit of novelty, with the candy theme, but seriously...Even the difficulty is a self-enforced one. ""Please, only use the red grips if you want a challenge"". Sure thing, I get that. But isn't that more of a achivement, and not so much of a difficulty implementation?1 level.It took me ~2 minutes to complete. That was the entire game.Think of this as level 1 of Super Mario. With only 1 type of enemy. For 20€.			",289,50,3,44,37,1,29

								I've given the game over a month to actually update the game with anything that would indicate it's price. But yet it's still just a poorly designed climbing challange that takes under a minute to complete.That's it, there's nothing more to it and has been that way for 2 months now.

								I really, really like the climbing and jumping mechanic of this game. I wish it were a bit more forgiving, but I really feel like I could get amazing at this game, after a while. I love the super bright colors of the world, and the fact that I can choose to party or execute my losing competitors at the end of the game. Super fun touches like that are what make the game fun to play. Because it is based on such a solid mechanic, I'm sure this is a game that will keep getting better and better, as time goes on. 100% recommended to buy.			",214,46,3,52,26,1,60

								This is far more enjoyable than I imagined. I have more fun playing this than The Climb for Oculus Rift. I don't get as scared in The Climb because I'm always looking up at the next place to grab and I'm also constantly looking at a wall. In this game you always see what's below you and let me tell you it's very scary when you're up high!			",83,34,9,7,39,8,1

								Sweet Escape VR is a very unique game. Climbing the courses with friends is great and can be a challenge. The best part of the game was being able to launch yourself from the the colorful gumdrops and choclatebars. Sweet Escape VR also isn't afraid of heights, falling couldn't be more terrifying.

								The climbing mechanic is incredibly well done. Once I got in the home, I soon found myself purely swinging from object to object, trying to impress my friends with death defying stunts. It brings back the sense of KZ climbers from counter-strike. I thoroughly enjoyed the feel of propelling myself forward and can't wait to see if they can make some truly challenging puzzles.

Early Access Review
								The novelty of the type of movement in this game cannot be overstated - it was the #1 reason that I decided to purchase this game, and it was everything that I expected.Throwing yourself from one candy to another is immensely satisfying -- and so is crawling from candy to candy. With the latest update, they've also added much longer courses, which make finishing the levels much more satisfying.Of course, the game is in early access, so there's a long ways to go - but I think Monster VR is on to something here, and I can't wait to see this game improve further. For the early access price tag, you absolutely cannot go wrong.[edit] I forgot to mention that the initial feeling of flying through the air like this can be disconcerting - I'm not prone to motion sickness, and this game didn't make me sick, but because of the way the movement is in this game, be prepared for a thrill - it's pretty awesome.

								Sweet Escape VR is a very fun climbing game.  The controls are extremely easy to master (trigger to grab, release and swing to jump) which is great for beginners to Virtual Reality.  My nephew and I both got on the other day and raced through the levels in multiplayer.  I can't wait to challenge more friends to a battle to the top.  Adding more levels, environment and hazards would add to the experience, but a great introduction from the team at Monster VR. ",68,26,5,1,19,8,4

								My first climbing game on the HTC Vive and I have to say it's amazing. The game mechanics feel wonderful and the artstyle is bright and colorful.

If more people heard of this im sure the multiplayer would be amazing.			",167,4,4,10,14,0,5

								Very fun game! Played it with my uncle last night and we had a great time racing each other. The game is very easy to master, very well designed and very fun to play. Only things that could make it better would maybe be some hazards other than falling to your death. Either way, for the price, this is a solid game.

								Totally fun climbing giant pieces of candy. Had a friend join in multiplayer. Didn't realize we were racing each other until he hit the death button and dropped me in some green soup.

								Sweet Escape VR is an interesting concept. Climb the Candy covered obstacle course using the candy as hand holds. The world is bright and colorful, the concept at its core is a lot of fun and the more difficult climbs can be quite a challenge. There are two main problems that I encountered with the game, the first (and more easily fixable) is that the game does not always recognize that you have grabbed one of the candy handholds forcing you to fall to your death for seemingly no reason. It doesnt happen often but it only has to happen once to ruin your climb. The second problem is that instead of feeling a sense of a vertical climb, you instead feel that you are pulling the game world around. If you stop moving and are looking up or down you get that feeling of verticality but its dispelled the moment you reach for that next hand hold. Finally the $20 price tag. I received the game as a gift from the PR Director for Monster VR for review and personal enjoyment. While I thank them for their generosity I would have been quite upset had I paid $20 for this game as the game is quite rough around the edges both in design and content and the $20 price tag is steep even for a VR title. $20 would get you Vanishing Realms, Audioshield, Tabletop Simulator, Solus Project, Pool Nation VR or Brookhaven. $15 could net you SPT, Holopoint or Battle Dome. Even if you have all of those games already, that $20 puts you halfway to the cost of VorpX which will let you play Skyrim, Bioshock, Borderlands, Saints Row on a movie theater sized 3d screen. If you have children who will be less likely to smash their controllers into the ceiling and will be more likely to be wowed by the candyland'esk landscape then this game could be a good investment to encourage them to get up and moving around, For everyone else I would have to recommend waiting until the game is heavily discounted or you have already bought all of the other high quality $20 and under VR titles.

Early Access Review
 Sweet Escape VR DISCLAIMER: I received this product for no cost for the purpose of reviewing. However, this does not affect my views and opinions of the game.Sweet Escape VR is the first VR game I've been able to play, so although I don't have much experience with this sort of game, I may revisit this review later on when the game is complete, and once I've experienced other VR titles. The game is an obstacle course. You climb and move through various candy themed hurdles until you reach the end of the stage. In single player mode, you're competing with yourself in getting the best/fastest time. In multiplayer mode, it's a race to see who can get to the end of the stage first.-------- Graphics: 6 / 10 The game's visuals don't strike me as amazing, however it is very colourful and the way the candy theme is incorporated is nice. There are some nice themes going on from time to time with a variety of ""sweet"" terrain. I did feel that there is a lack of texture throughout the game, as everything looked very shiny and rounded. That being said, the game ran smoothly on my system and I'm sure the game would run fine on any basic setup.-------- Sound: 6 / 10 At first the sound assets were fine, and for anyone that enjoy rock covers of classic children's themes, then you might enjoy this. ""Do your ear's hang low?"" plays in the background of the stage and it does get repetitive after awhile.  Although there are also a few nice chiptunes within the game as well.-------- Mechanics: 6 / 10 The mechanics with the VR system are pretty solid, I didn't run into any issues, and it was pretty responsive to the controls. It may take some getting used to at the beginning to figure out how far you have to stretch to latch onto an object in game, but it doesn't take that long to get a hold of it.-------- Final Personal Remarks: These types of racing/speed running games are not something I usually enjoy, so I wasn't drawn into this game as much as other titles. I can see how some people would enjoy this title however, and I do think that this game is good for beginners to test out VR capabilities as well as getting a feel for these types of games. Thanks to the Devs for giving me the opportunity to review the game, as well as anyone who took this review into consideration, I hope it helped.			",3016,1209,118,322,420,38,485

								Had to a chance to try the game out  and I will say it is very fun. Luckily, I am trying it after they have released more content for the game. The replay value for multiplayer is decent, especially for entertaining kids and guest. Single player is not bad but not as fun as playing with others, as the game was designed for. A lot of the negative reviews mentioned that the price point is high for this product. Eventhough I got to try it for free, I would agree. Once the product is priced accordingly, this game will be worth the purchased. My main recommenation for the creators: as a consumer is to release more content more often for demo/incomplete games like these. We don't mind paying, but price it right and keep up with the people that put faith in your brand and company by buying your product. Overall, I would recomment the game as it is fun and entertaining, and it showcases multiplayer VR decently. However, read carefully and know what you are paying for and if it's priced right for you, grab a copy!			",15,5,0,0,0,0,1

Early Access Review
								As an early access title, I can absolutely forgive Sweet Escape VR for being incomplete.  I'm putting faith that an even better and more complete title is on its way in the future.As it stands, the current game is a single race along rock walls made of HTC branded chocolate bars, gum drops, candy canes and gummy bears.  There's multiplayer connectivity available if you have two Vives or connect via matchmaking features that likely won't turn up many other players until people both have VR headsets and buy the game.  I demoed an earlier build last month at a convention and the competiveness of a two player race is excellent.There's a bit of a challenge with multiple paths along the way to the finish line, with the green gumdrops being an easy path and the yellow gumdrops providing more of a challenge, but overall, there's currently not more than 10 minutes or so of single player content if you aren't racing friends or internet strangers.What exists today is an extremely fun concept and it actually feels like I'm stretching to grab the next hold on a rock wall each time I extend my arm and controller.  I think it is a good gamble to take at the highly reduced price for early access for a game very early in development.  Now I just need more people to buy it so that I have an excuse to practice and race you!			",258,89,11,10,80,16,10
