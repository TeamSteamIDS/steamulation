IntroductionMantis Burn Racing is developed and published by VooFoo Studios. Their first projects had nothing to do with racing, instead focusing on card & board games along with pool/snooker. Mantis has received far better reception than the previous three titles but a pattern still emerges in concern to the overall pricing of VooFoo games. GameplayAt least the screenshots offer no deceit. What you see is what you get and that is, quite a decent racer  indeed. I’m not going to deny its element of fun since Mantis Burn can be quite entertaining until you realize that there’s more difference in the cars than in the tracks themselves. Truly, if it would have still been in Early Access, I would have let this misshap slide and hope to see a decent amount of tracks and scenery by the time it fully releases. But in its current state, once you spend more than two hours and the progression allows you to purchase better vehicles, you begin to feel like in a continuous loop as far as the racing tracks are concerned. Reversing them and offering several game modes, doesn’t make them feel new in any way whatsoever. As if the variety issue wasn’t enough, I was disheartened by how much grinding is required in order to unlock the best cars within Mantis Burn Racing. From a gameplay perspective, it looked great on paper: a top-down 3D racer with modern graphics, responsive keyboard bindings, drifting and a logical scale of progression which involved in-game currency (gears) that can be spent on the purchase of new vehicles along with a merit system for the mechanical upgrades. It delivers only in partial terms. With the almost encouraged grinding of previously passed levels, you can gather more than enough gears without the implication of any actual effort. Especially if you rinse & repeat the Rookie League from the beginning of the Career Mode. The upgrades are fairly superficial since they only offer a one-time use and even then you notice a marginal benefit at best. At least you unlock these in limited number so you can’t cheat as much as with the currency. The keyboard controls were great in terms of response, though the inability to rebind them might disappoint some players. Still the game runs fine even without the need of a controller. But I cannot stress this enough: it matters not how many cars you have in-game (also spread into three categories: Light, Medium & Heavy) if the racing tracks become familiar to the point at which you barely put any effort in it at all. Finding a perfect balance between the number of vehicles and the circuits, is what makes or breaks a racing video game. For a top-down racer, Mantis Burn certainly looks the part. While the graphical settings are allowing little freedom over the actual tweaking, running the game maxed out, you can’t really complain. It’s a smooth experience, the sounds are convincing and even the music doesn’t feel repetitive. From the limited selection of tracks and scenery, two major stages stand out: Desert and City. The arid and sometimes volcanic racing circuits offer mostly endurance challenges, while drifting is more at home within the urban sprawls, especially as the game passed the Rookie levels. Combining that with the speed of the cars unlocked late-game, Mantis might be considered better than its counterparts/rivals. If only it had more tracks to show and test. Pros+ Nice graphics and sounds+ Sharp control scheme+ Steam Achievements & Trading CardsCons- Tracks are in dire need of variety- Slightly overpriced- Too much grinding to unlock new carsResult / Final thoughtsI still think that Mantis Burn Racing can introduce new stages and environments, which is why I’d still recommend you buy it in the near future and once you find it at some form of discount or bundled. Even with the presence of Trading Cards and its large number of Achievements, it’s definitely not worth 16 dollars or euros.Rating 65/100 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews, through the generous contribution of RedHill.

												In a time where racing cabinets lined the now mostly gone arcades, standing out from the rest with their replica seat and steering-wheel set-ups. Top-down racers like Super Sprint paved the way for a whole generation of multiplayer oriented racing that would later find its home on consoles in the form of legendary series like Super Off Road or Micro Machines. For such a memorable genre that had shaped the early experiences of many racing game players, it's disappointing to see its popularity waning in recent years. Mantis Burn Racing seeks to bring glory back to the genre with gorgeous modern visuals, pitch-perfect controls with a seriously weighty and realistic feel, bucketloads of content and all of the multiplayer and online features you could possibly need.Mantis Burn Racing is much more than your usual top-down racer, though. With at least 8 different modes including your usual racing across a sprawling progressive campaign, there's enough content here to rival your typical AAA racing title. There's everything from Elimination rounds to adrenaline pumping Overtake matches, and of course self-testing Time Trials for a little less chaos. The two locales the numerous variations of tracks take place across are gorgeously detailed and realistic, a sandy desert filled with plenty of dunes to jump and winding city streets of a metropolis set the stage for a diverse set of complex and intense races.It didn't even matter when the setting stayed the same, because each track was so wildly different from the last. Each level throws new tricks, new twists and turns, and more beautifully rendered scenery to look at. Hitting jumps over winding rivers and drifting under the flowing waterfalls, each stage of the campaign offered something new both in gameplay and incredible setpieces.The switches from the bright and warm daytimes of the desert to  the cool and dim visuals of the city night sky make you feel like you're playing an almost entirely different game, and give a seriously genuine atmosphere for all kinds of drivers. Visually, Mantis Burn Racing sets a new precedent for top-down racing, and hopefully this is enough to give the genre its much needed comeback.This is a classic arcade racer in every sense, including difficulty. It eases you in with relaxing rides and helpful upgrades, but soon in the campaign you'll need fast reflexes and quick maneuvering. Mistakes are not recoverable, so having your wits about you at all moments is mandatory. Slamming into a boulder or a barricade will bring your vehicle to a full stop usually, and leave you in the dust only able to watch the competition whizz by. With three distinct car classes and various skill tiers throughout the campaign, I was already repeating races for upgrade points on Rookie. It's challenging and demands lots of practice, but Mantis Burn Racing is also very customizable and has a whole lot of variety to keep your options open and your practices interesting as you pave your way to professional driving and drifting.The key to winning in Mantis Burn Racing is slick and tricky driving. As you pull off each drift, each jump, draft and overtake your boost meter rises, pushing you to drive stylishly. When the meter is filled your nitrous boost is ready, and when used with proper timing can propel you past the competition in a heartbeat. Attempting to drive with skill is an addictive process, it takes time but the feeling of driving in Mantis Burn Racing is so good, so slick and precise that practicing is nothing short of pure pleasure and adrenaline.

Early Access Review
								Sounds like a very Action Packed game, and so I tested it out. Through the Game I wrote little notes about what the games pros and cons. Let's start with the Pros.- It Supports Career, Online play and Lan. But as it's a new game, I had fun playing online alone.- Simple menu layout- Graphics are good and in a way, realistic.- Arcade type of Driving, which was fine.- 6 different cars, all with different stats and upgradable.- Career Mode could take a while to finish.- Gives me a sense of achievement at times as its challenging.- It's basically Fun... For abit..- Overall it has good game mechanics..And now the cons.- Sounds / Audio cut out (Loops) and it is hearable- Original songs are good, but it would be nice if it changes over time, instead of playing the same songs.- Camera can be annoying at times.- It gets boring and Repetitive over time, I got bored of it after 30 Mins.So to anyone who intends on buying it, go ahead, for only $8.35, Mantis Burn Racing is a Good Racing game, Addictive for only 30 mins.Here's a video for it:

Early Access Review
								Really cool looking game--awesome graphics.  My big issue, however, is the camera.  The trailer and photos make it look like the game has a cool angled camera, but in reality the camera is locked directly on top of your car, and it turns when you turn, making the steering completely unsatisfying.  If we could get a better camera then this game would be much better.  Still, I'm recommending it because I think it has potential and I want to see it improve.  Hopefully early access is kind to this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Played this game at EGX and I was blown away by the graphics and playability. The game is great fun, with weekly challenges, career mode and online races. The tracks are well thought out and it's really easy to pick up and play. I have yet to try the 4 player split screen. This little gem really takes me back to the days of ""skid marks and micro machines"". Great game.			",159,8,5,14,9,0,30

								If you were a fan of Super Off-Road or Powerslide........congrats, you're old like me. And also, this game will be right up your alley! Lots of dusty, tail-sliding fun to be had here (there's a non-dusty map as well but really, where's the fun in that) with a reasonably decent balance of talent & upgrades required to succeed. There's really not many racing games like this left, let alone on PC, so give these guys your support if you're into arcade racers!			",755,208,34,120,71,13,130

Early Access Review
								Early critisismsA few things that stuck out to me within my first day of owning the game, when reading please remember that this is a DAY ONE, EARLY ACCESS review, and its not even a review, more like a few issues that struck me within the first day of ownership.The one thing that is bugging me currently more than anything is the camera, and this is probably why I've spent so little time in the game so far. The in game camera is hard tethered to the car and its movement, resulting in the camera swinging jarringly at the touch of a joystick, this is extremely nausiating for me, especially because of the wide FOV of the viewing camera, which is not helping at all. I was rather hoping the camera would be fixed, like in the release trailer, or have an option to be soft tethered, whereby the camera is following the direction and angle of the track, and not the car. Secondly, the handling of the cars seems far too forgiving. The way the cars slide, and speed and angle around corners regardless of how much I try to whip it into a corner is highly unrealistic. Yes, I get that this is a casual, arcade racer, almost all arcade racing games adhere to basic physics when it comes to cornering, and it just looks plain weird to see a car getting a load of angle around a corner, without the slightest dab of countersteer, thats not how any of this works.However, the gameplay is good, the AI are okay for what they are, the environment and tracks are great to look and and even better to race, but the UI is a bit counter intuitive, and the lack of mouse navigation, and being forced to chose between Keyboard and Pad is confusing, but I honestly wasn't expecting much for the initial release on early access, other than some basic functionality and gameplay, and looking at the career mode, VooFoo has exceeded that.I'll definitely be playing more of this game, and would recommend it, of course only if you're willing to get into an early access game that is currently in development, but currently the camera mode is holding me back, as I'd rather not get motion sick after 5 minutes of playing.

												First played this at EGX and really liked it. Not played it very much to date but so far I'm enjoying it, career mode is good and the local split screen is fun. If you have 7 other mates who have this then it's going to loads of fun.Graphics are good, sounds is ok, handling is good and the camera I don't think is too bad.Not sure this is going to keep your attention for too long unless you really like these types of games. Check out some local split screen racing.

								Good solid racing fun, as an early access game it's already got the core gameplay nailed (it's rather fun to race around the tracks!). There is room for improvement on the camera and some of the techy bits and bobs (loading felt a bit slow for instance), but neither really get in the way of a solid racing game, I love the retro overhead viewpoint!I look forward to seeing how the game evolves and improves over time!Note, the camera has already been improved since I first picked this up, and as it's early-access so expect plenty of tweaks and improvements as it goes along!

Early Access Review
								I had the chance to play Mantis Burn Racing and I was impressed with what this Early Access top-down racer had to offer. For an Early Access title, it has the core gameplay mechanics nailed. Controls are tight and responsive with various vehicles within a three weight-class system, all of which look and feel different.What I really enjoyed were the RPG mechanics implemented in this racing game. As you race you earn cash and XP that you can then spend on individual car upgrades, such as longer boosts, better handling, and faster top-speeds! What's rad is it uses a slot system, like socketing gems into gear in Diablo, but in this case upgrades into slots of a car. You only have so many slots available, making it fun to try different upgrade combinations for each vehicle type.Mantis Burn Racing also comes with a 3-Season Single-Player Campaign mode across 4 very different tracks and a bunch of different racing modes.In addition, online multi-player is available, although I have yet to play online so I am unable to comment on how well it works.discoverplayshare.com/news/taking-mantis-burn-racing-for-a-test-drive/ ",508,48,7,52,51,4,45

												I've tried most of the top-down racers since the Amiga days. I think my 1st was Micro Machines. That's a long long time. I have a buch of them on my iPad and a few on my PC. Mantis Burn Racing is one of the best of the serious top-down racers (I never liked the ones that take place on desks or tabletops with kitchen utensils or desk stuff determining the course. They can be fun but seem childish to me and I take my racing seriously).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The gameplay is very good and you can't deny how awesome it feels to do an awesome drift. However, everything seems a little bit... shallow. The arenas are pretty empty, the stages looks the same and the music gets repetitive rather quickly. Is not bad, I'm recommending the game... but is FAR from great. everything feels shallow, somehow. I would love if the cars looked a little bit bigger, looked better (in graphics. I mean) and maybe with an announcer? Or someone who can bring more life to this game. That would be amazing.

There is a wide variety of cars and a full progression and upgrade system in place for them.The one thing missing at this point is a wider variety of environments and races.  They have already added some new ones while in Early Access, so as they add more it should only make the game even better.			",823,182,58,62,76,6,80

								Great game, reminiscent of all the great top down racing games I loved (and still love) when I was growing up. It's really pretty - especailly the offroad courses. I have found it difficult to get a multiplayer game going - the game could do with informing the player how many people are online but I guess it's early days and the audience has to build. However, the game has great potential and I’m looking forward to updates and can't wait until there are more courses. Recommended!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Received this game through early access and was pleased with the product. There were a few issues to start with which other reviewers have commented on but they were only minor niggles. Coming back to the game after a couple of weeks I can see the devs have gave it a spit and polish and it now plays a lot smoother. The background music could do with a revamp though as it gets a bit repetitive but that is my only niggle so far.It's a great looking, addictive top down racer which has quite the learning curve. Tracks are varied and the AI of the other vehicles is pretty good, reminds me of the old school racers back in the early 90's. I would definitely recommend it.			",19,1,1,3,0,0,0

												Overall it's currently a good  single player top down racer with multiplayer potential.I'd change my vote to recommended if a few things would change. Mostly this resolves around sound and multiplayer.Currently multiplayer is dead but devs promised bot support so here's hoping you'll be able to have multiplayer fun with a few friends soonish.Be warned: although the list of negative points is longer I actually really enjoyed the game so far. It's just that some points need fixing to make it great for everyone, not just top down racer fans.+ great and organic looking tracks+ good car handling+ interesting upgrade scheme+ decent selection of cars+ good camera options+ weekly challenges+ decent and ""flowy"" tracks- no multiplayer bot support / dead multiplayer- poor sound design (cheap, muffled, far away sounding)- no dynamic lights- no breaking lights, no headlights (even in caves)- boost system should be tuned so it can be used more often even on low tiers- there should be a catch up mechanic for players falling behind too far- dull looking colors on cars / uncreative skins- very few options to customize graphics- poor collision handling- only two environments (desert and city)- music boring, unengaging and repetive- effect of upgrades poorly described and barely felt- prone to cheating (you can easily edit in memory values, including money and times)~ a 2 and a 4 pack should be added~ reverse kicks in too slow~ price point seems a little bit too high for whats in the game right now			",768,213,44,98,87,13,116
