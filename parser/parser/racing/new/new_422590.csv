								It's so rare to see a PC game featuring a 4 players split screen mode and even if it still need some optimizations, the game feels pretty promising!			",443,135,14,31,35,11,43

Early Access Review
								A great remake of a classic dos game. A little rough around the edges but captures the spirit of the first game and builds upon it's strengths. 8/10 for now, menu is quite glitchy sometimes, and hopefully we can get a map editor and workshop support for this...these two things would make it an easy 10/10.

												A fun remake of a classic kart racing game. Reminds me of my early gaming days on SNES playing Mario Kart. The retro yet polished visuals and classic kart mechanics/weapons make this a must have for kart racing fans.  Verdict: 8/10			",303,78,22,28,33,3,46

								Though there are technical problems (FPS drops, glitches etc.) the game itself is fun, and with the multiplayer added later (no region lock) it would seem like a no brainer for 10€.Further polish is needed (controls, mechanics, content), but devs are listening to the community and working on the issues.For now (Early Access) I see no huge reason not to give this revival a chance and relive fond childhood memories.

												Good, but I also think you screwed up, there's too much advantage to take with the power slide, you can overlap everyone multiple times if used correctly, would I recommend, yeah, it's fun. but I feel like I'm relying purely on power sliding for serious gain, rather than using it like in the classic to maneuver extremely sharp turns, I believe the speed maintained at the fullest of using power slide/drift . should also be capable of achieving without  the power slide.  I feel if you don't do this, the game will get old pretty quick, just being honest, but I do enjoy it, and consider playing time time I wouldn't not listen to what was said in this review, and get to patching. This isn't wacky wheels hd through my eyes, its just another wacky wheels that might not leave as big as a impression in my memory as the first. Also I have to port forward to play with buds, whats the deal guys lol?			",206,9,1,13,8,0,5

												Great idea, but the input function shoud not limit one to just a keyboard or a gamepad... just use one for each player like the original game. further i'm missing a lot of annimations like the spinning wheel when selecting a character and the sounds those characters make. but i like the main design! it's fun and it his resemblances of the original game. still a lot of work to do i guess, cause if there's something happening in the background in windows i can't get the controll back in the game.

								This is Early Access, with all that means, but so far at least it is Early Access done right.  It is still being updated, the developer is listening to feedback and iterating and making meaningful changes that make the game feel better.  If you hop in now and something doesn't feel right, if you can articulate it you have a chance at seeing it get fixed.  The visuals are in the spirit of the original, which has always been an old favorite.  I am definitely looking forward to putting some more time into this as it progresses.			",101,7,8,1,7,0,6

												TL;DRNothing like the original. Terrible controls. Somewhat buggy gameplay. Boring and ill-fitting graphics design. Most of the sounds are annoying. Thin, reverby music.Yes yes, I've played the game for less than 10 minutes, but seriously, that was enough.The way the karts control is horrible. Hitting the brake in a corner, accelerates you in the opposite direction of what you're turning. And no, it's not just that the camera moves to the side when drifting (which is annoying btw). I tested it several times. I can steer sharply to the RIGHT, while driving straight, by simply pressing LEFT and brake, and vice versa. I can hardly get through a hairpin and not hit the walls, unless I brake hard (without turning), and take the corner with 10 km/h. The original game is all about timing your handbrake turns, for just about every 90+ degree turn, and your shots (making no sense) following your turning, so they're always straight ahead of you (makes for great trick-shots). In this version, none of the weapons really feel awesome to use.Then there's the movement and obstacles. The AI's seem to lag through the air when jumping, and for some reason it's like you're sped up to 5x speed when jumping, which makes it feel like you come to a grinding halt when you land, so the jumps don't even feel awesome to do. More like a weird feeling, than anything else. And you can get stuck between a tree and the wall, without touching either, when there is clearly a lot of room for you to pass between them. Also, the sound for when the karts smash together, is not good. Sounds like two cardboard boxes being smashed together, with some added distortion.I'm not too fond of the graphics, either. In the old game, a fireball looked like a fireball. Here, they're just soft-white spheres with small spikes. And nothing quite fits together. Neon-green boost-patches and jumps? Large green question marks? It all just feels half-done.Also, the music is pitchy and reverby, and doesn't really ""fit"", which reverby and pitchy music seldom does.Which ""Wacky Wheels"" did you guys play? All the things that were unique and special about the original, are gone. This is just another cartoon kart racer, with the most terrible controls I've ever seen in a kart game, in my 27 years as a gamer.I really wanted to like this game. I LOVE the original. Bought it when I was 12 with my own savings, and loved it to bits. I had seen the videos and screenshots, and knew I wasn't getting the exact same thing, but the only thing this has in common with the original, is the description on the tin: ""Animals racing karts, shooting hedgehogs at each other. Also there are bombs, fireballs and spilled oil.""			",34,3,2,4,10,0,0

												For the released game the menu is far to glitchy. Like mouse is not working on all the buttons if you choose Grand Prix and 2 Players. You can't switch the characters with the mouse.The gameplay did not feel like the old game, or the classic version i got in steam.In the old games you got nearly stopped when you hit a border.Well only played some minutes and stopped - I loved Wacky Wheels in the old days and play the classic version. Hoped i could have some multiplayer fun with old friends, but the game feels like a rough beta and need some pretty good clean  up the get on the level of the old wacky wheels.

								Fun, but the controls are a little off, and the handling feels floaty and unresponsive.  I'd wait on this one.  I go into a little more detail in this video (the Wacky Wheels section starts at around the 20:55 mark.

												Ooooooooh boy is this not finished. I only played maybe less than a few minutes and judging from the lack of music while racing, incompetent kart AI, and possibly no controller support (I am on a mac so that may not be an issue), I can safely say I definitly caught this right as it was released. I like the Super Mario Kart aesthetic going on, there is plenty here to admire and to be build on, but it R-E-A-L-L-Y needs some more thought into it besides a blantant rip of Super Mario Kart from the SNES, which came out over 20 years ago. Now dev(s), I know you can do better, this is a good start, and you're going in the right direction with this from as far as I can tell, so I'm hoping for some worthwhlie updates later! :D			",8,1,1,2,1,1,1
