												A decent arcade racing game, fun and has great music and quite good graphics.I recommend it for everyone who enjoys arcade racing games.Especially if they need to de-stress and get fun.On each map there will be a lot of jumps.Your task is to fly higher, turn around for a while and get paid for it.You can upgreade your car to make it awesome.It's actually the fun single-computer multiplayer racing game I have ever played.

								I have to say this is one of the all time great being overshadowed by Triple AAA dissapointed. This gave me more fun than Tom Clancy the Division and COD BOP 3 combined. The developer influence from Rocket League, Tony Hawk and Jet Star Radio has allowed the game to become a combination of the three and flourish as it own game. So far all review so far have been extremely good and this is no difference. This game is true fun which is all you want from one, you can play with friend, high replayablilty, great soundtrack and more. Nothing to prove. Game of the Year Award. Viva Del Tacopocalyse.

												Tacopocalypse:~~~~~~~~~~~~  Are you looking for a job to get you through your University studies? Maybe you are just looking at an additional income to put food on the table for your family. Have you thought of becoming a delivery person for a Mexican fast food business?  Great, we need drivers to deliver huge numbers of tacos . . . Just think Taco, Taco and only Taco! Tacopocalypse is all you need to know!Tacopocalypse is a racing / action game where you have to deliver as many Taco orders as possible within three minutes.As you are a new recruit, it will be a good idea to learn the ropes to become an expert taco delivery person by playing a short an easy-to-follow tutorial. After familiarising yourself with the controls, you will be able to choose to play in one of the four available maps, which are: Golden Bay Burps, Downtown, the Military Airport and the Beachside. You will only be able to carry a maximum of three serves of tacos at any given time. Locate all the taco symbols and make sure you touch them with your state-of-the-art second-hand car to make a delivery. The interesting thing is that some icons will be located on tops of buildings or even in the middle of nowhere. This is where you will need to know how to use ramps as well as your speed booster to be able to reach them. The other interesting point is that your car has a curious suspension system. Yes, your car can jump and even double jump, which can be very helpful at times, especially for avoiding collisions with other vehicles. Each time you successfully deliver an order, you’ll be collecting money which you’ll be able to use to unlock specific upgrades, paints or even for purchasing exciting new delivery cars.  There are other icons to collect, such as tape recorders (which will unlock new songs) and spray paint (which will give you access to additional paint jobs to customize your car). You will definitely run out of stock very quickly (remember, you only carry three meals in your car), so locate the pick-up point to re-stock - you can’t miss it; it’s a big yellow circle with small taco’s flying up towards the sky. As with all good taco delivery person, stunts are in your veins and the bigger they are the better it is to boost your income.I like the car customization; nothing too fancy but when you collect enough money, you can purchase new parts such as spoilers, antennas and others. You can play this game on a local-network too, with three of your friends, which is a lot of fun.The graphics are nice and the soundtrack is very good too. I would definitely recommend playing with your gamepad as I find it easier to control. I do feel that we need more content (additional icons to pick up and maps) in Tacopocalypse.Positives:~~~~~~~ -	Nice artwork-	Fun and easy to play-	Good soundtrack-	Achievements and trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~ -	Definitely need more contentsTacopocalypse is a fun casual racing game.6/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

												I was not expecting Crazy Taxi meets Tony Hawk's Pro Skater when I started this game but that's exactly what I got: deliver tacos in the apocalypse as a soundtrack of actual punk bands blare and the ollies are leading into the flips.Definitely one of the more creative indie games under the radar on Steam right now and should be checked out by anyone who wants a fun over the top car stunt game.

								Tacopocalypse is a mechanical blast from the past featuring tricks and scoring fromTony Hawks, the delivery aspect of Crazy Taxi, and the car mechanics of Rocket League... but let's not forget that incredible soundtrack.Playing this early build hints that this title has SO MUCH potential to be great with the right love. Maybe future releases could feature objectives like the old THPS? Maybe we could see an online mode? I could go on with how giddy this throwback is getting me.			",185,19,5,21,9,5,7

												So much Dreamcast era nostalgia packed into this lovingly crafted little indie gem.  The developers seem very active, whether on the Steam forums or Kickstarter.  You can run this thing on a potato, I easily ran it maxed out above 1080p and still had a rock solid 60 fps.  First Unreal 4 Engine title that I've been able to do that with, lol.  The celshading is simple, but highly effective.  Love the Jet Set Radio visuals.  The absurdity of a taco truck somersaulting through the air, doing ollies and grinding on rails while the world is engulfed in the fiery blaze of Armageddon . . . . not gonna lie I lost it a few times.My only gripe is how much weight I'm going to gain playing this game.  Everytime I boot it up now I want to take a trip to either Capital Tacos or Tijuana Flats lol!			",864,118,17,85,39,3,33

												I have had this game since early access and am glad that I got it when I did because I have always really liked the concept of this game. I actually just started it up for a quick look at it and it has improved significantly from when I have last played the game. The momentum and physics have improved greatly. Before it was like the original Super Smash Flash, almost as if you were constantly driving on ice and it was quite impossible to steer although the concept was fantastic to me from the start. The environment is now destructible and seems like it has added lots of fun to the game. I look forward to trying this out and I will give you more of an update later.			",380,55,3,18,20,2,26

								At this state I can say so far the game looks very solid and great, the only thing I can complain about is controls - I really wish you could spread steering and rotating. Other than that - colorful and amazing graphics, great music and very nice style.			",276,67,3,19,33,2,28

								You can wall ride and grind rails with a car. Need I say more? Okay, I'll say a bit more. ;)PROS:Crazy Taxi meets Tony Hawk Pro Skater in this beautifully colored cartoony playground of skateboard-cars. Not to mention the word's ending so everything's exploding! This game features awesome graphics, fun gameplay, local multiplayer, multiple game modes, fluid controls, and innovative mechanics. I can go on and on!CONS:I want to run people over and throw tacos at their corpses.			",18,1,0,3,0,2,0

								It looks dope though. I've got Steam on Mac (which it works for Mac). The game will start up, but every time I choose practice mode or customization, the game crashes and sends me to the desktop. I know that it's a new game, but I would  love to play this game if only I knew the issue.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tacos + Apocalypse = Tacopaclypse. A fun game about delivering tacos at the end of the world. I really like the new added game modes and new maps. If you liked crazy taxi this game is definitely up your alley. Also has some cool stunts in the game that kind of remind me of Tony Hawk.			",34,6,0,11,5,0,1
