8/10""The cool little brother of Trials Evolution - without Uplay!!!""Great arcade-beating-your friends-highscore title.Although this is an offshoot, Urban Trial Freestyle feels very good even if it's not as perfect as Trials Evolution. But it offers some new features&improvements I really enjoyed. No uplay, no friend score lags, 4 new ingame records (e.g.highest & longest jump), better ingame ghost bikes & the ""background"" action of the stages.Pros:+ no uplay!!!+ great stages (a lot is going on in the background)+ good controls+ good gameplay+ nice graphics+ okay ost&sounds+ addictive & challenging+ new ingame records feature (example)+ ghost bikes of friends+ leaderboards+ no highscore lags + full X360 controller support=> highly recommended!!!Cons:- it feels a bit different than TE, but what the heck!- not as much stages as in TE- no tricks (grabs) you actually do by yourself- no multiplayerDefinitely worth the 0.99 on summer sale!!!

												Urban Trial Freestyle feels like a cheaper version of Trials. It's alright though. And it controls pretty much the same as the Trials games. Unfortunately, the graphics are so-so but there's much more going on in the levels animation-wise. At times it's a bit distracting and sometimes it can be hard to see what you have to do or where you have to go, but it at least made the world feel alive, even if it's an arcade racer.The races/levels can be hard, and earning stars halfway through the game can be frustrating, especially if you want to unlock the next batch of levels. The levels are generally pretty short, however, so I can't see anyone ragequiting over them. But it's a time consuming task.Like Trials, you can also change your character's clothing and upgrade his motorcycle. You can do this with money. Money is scattered across the levels and collecting it will allow you to do this. Some of it is hidden in plain sight, other bags are located in less obvious places. Finishing a level doesn't always result in you getting money so that was what I meant when I was talking about the frustration part earlier. Upgrading your motorcycle can help you improve your score(s).In the end UFT is a good game, but just not good enough. Pay a few [currency] more and buy Trials instead. And buy this in a sale later on.[Rating: 76/100]			",1655,629,69,221,194,16,225

												Ok lets get this out of the way first yes this game is a clone of ""TRIALS EVOLUTION"" but is that a bad thing-i think not.The game plays very smoothly and the graphics and sound are both well suited to this type of game,i actually think i like this more than ""TRIALS"" (played on X BOX not on pc-so not sure how it plays on the pc to be honest).The bike handles well and only becomes more tricky to handle when you upgrade it but this is a part of the game as some later levels get quite tricky to do unless the bike actually is upgraded.As the game progresses you earn money (found in levels and sometimes it is quite trickey to get) which you use to upgrade the bike and also you can buy new gear such as gloves,helmet,trousers ect.All these things though are cosmetic and offer no in game incentive (no increase to anything such as speed,handling ect) other than to make your character look more like you want them to.If i was to play one game or the other i think i would choose this over ""TRIALS"" as it just seems to be that little bit more user friendly and therefor a more forgiving experience,which leads to a better gaming experience all round.

												This is a really good little game, especially if you can get it in a sale, then money well spent.Also everyone who reads this and i know what you are thinking, is it like trials hd on the x-box 360. well no, no it isnt, the physics are not as sharp as trials but personally i found them better than trials hd to be honest, not to punishing,.My advice would be to by this and trials hd, and use this to practice on and to have fun, because it is a very good fun gameBut yes i would reccomend to a friend, and also the graphics, im using a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650 GDDR5 1GB graphics card with 16GB RAM Intel Core I5-3570K CPU @ 3.40GHz Proccesor On a ASUS P8Z77-V LX MotherBoard, and i can say they ran very smoothly, they look quite very good/cool, plus going up against the leader board is proper addictive at times, the game also works on controllers too which for me was added bonus.Now.The downsides.There is not any really, other than no content yet, but im sure the devs are prbably monitoring this thread for advive on where to go next,Me Personally would offer up a track editer of some kind so you can come up with some tracks of your own, this alone can add an endless play factor to it, and also add some challenges in the form of updates and also paid for DLC, extra fun challenges tracks time trials you could put anything in it,  make some packs paid for and also make some free as thanks for being loyal customers...Me and our lass have had a blast on it, so, if you have got to the end of this review, then what are you doing still here.Go Buy It As You Wont Be Dissaponted....My Score & Rank Is : 4.½ Out Of 5.0Top Notch Freakin GameProper Fun TimesThats my review and what i think personallyCheersmark117hP.S. ###### Yes I Would Recommend This Game To A Friend Defo ######			",69,4,5,7,4,0,1

												Well this game surprised me, a hell of a lot!What looks like a dodgey Trials HD rip off from the store page, turns out to be a fairly decent competitor.The game features full controller support, friend-list and worldwide leaderboards, player ghosts to race against, achievements, minigames, steam cloud and trading cards.PROSExtremely well optimisedGraphics better/on par with TrialsAdds new gameplay elements that pit you against your friends mid levelControls great, 360 pad controls being the same as TrialsUses friends avatars and scores in unique and competitive yet fun waysA fair amount of contentGenerously pricedSmall download sizeNo uPlay DRMCONSSlight repeat of levels from time to timeNot many video optionsNot the tightest bike control when compared to Trials franchiseUses annoying mobile-like star system to progress in campaignLimited player and bike customisationsNo multiplayerNot many levels seem to rely on speed, something that makes Trials exciting=-=-=Overall I had to think much harder for the list of cons than I did the pros and even at double the cost it's worth every penny. Trials on Steam comes with horrible uPlay DRM and aren't the most optimised of games. So for the budget PC gamer who loves him/her some trials biking, this is 100% the game for you.Play the game so I can race against you in my Urban Trial Freestyle friendslist.

												Remember when Trails came out?  It was super hard, yet entertaining in their use of physics with tight controls and well thought out maps and levels that were hard, but managable once you mastered the controls! Urban Trail Freestyle is just like that, if it was the same game with ugly textures, floaty controls, damn near impossible obsticles and your roommate kicking you in the beans periodically through game play. For $.99, I got 45 minutes to an hour of playtime out of it.  It's not unplayable yet it's not really enjoyable either.  They tried to spice it up with a half ♥♥♥♥♥ trick system that you have absolutely no control over.   The controls are sloppy at best and will lead to much swearing and teeth gnashing.   I would have played through it, except for a near impossible obsticle half way through world 4 (I think) and after 15 minutes of retrying that, it dawned on me I'd have more fun going to chew tinfoilBut hey, at least it's got cards!

100% worth the pricetagA modern-day version of the NES classic Excitebike. This type of games have been very popular on Flash game sites since forever.Really nice graphics for this type of game, the developers have done a marvelous job.It is essentially a 2D game in a 3D world. You see your motocross bike from the side, basic controls to accelerate, decelerate and control your pitch (lean forwards/back).The goal is to drive through the course as quickly as possible while avoiding obstacles and performing certain tasks. Each level have a set of objectives where you get tested such as; ""Precise Aim"" where you need to jump as close at a target as possible, ""Highest Jump"" where you jump as high as possible, etc.Your records are uploaded and you can compare to other players online.On the levels there's moneybags, if you collect these you can buy new parts for your motocross bike and costumes for your character.There are 5 different ""worlds"" with ~8 levels on each, some levels seem to be reused or atleast portions of them are, but this is fine, they offer different challenges in the objectives instead.Once you've started making your way through the main levels, a series of challenges start to unlock which are wildly different from the main game. I strongly encourage you to try the challenge levels!I think it could be a fun element if they added tricks to it, for bonus points. There are a few places where you need to do flips to get bonus points, however I would imagine something more freely. Perhaps that goes into a different genre of motocross games tho.I can't really tell if the music is good or not, it's just ambiance. Full-focus on driving and trying to hit the jumps!

												A poor man's trials fusion. A decent indie attempt at that type of game but nowhere near as good as the triple a version. The motorcycle never feels ""fast"" and the sound is more annoying than authentic. Graphics aren't impressive but there are some pretty cool environments. That being said it is sometimes hard to distinguish what is in the foreground and what is in the background. Also some of the jumps and stunts that the game makes you aren't that good and feel awkward. For some reason this game's levels are gated with a mobile game like star unlock system where you must do well on the previous levels to move on. This meant that I couldn't progress after failing to beat one particular level with some pretty bad design. There is only 1 bike with upgrades and some player skins with no actual impact on gameplay. That being said, I did have fun. For its current asking price of 10 USD I would say that this game is worth it if you are very interested in 2d platforming racing games but only just. I would rather wait for a heavy discount if you are anyone else.			",637,167,18,57,56,10,122

												Yes Evo and this are similar, but UTF is different enough to make it worth while getting (if on sale like I did for $4). UTF  is very arcade like; levels are either timed race to the line or high scores by complete tricks (flips, highest jumps, longest jumps). None of the levels are hard unlike Evo which gets pretty full on in some levels. There are limited power ups but choice of bike powerup does make a difference in the levels. The bike doesn't handle the same as Evo at all (which I spent many hours playing on xbox) but Evo is all about the level design and bike control. This game is about having fun so bike control not as important so I didn't mind - it still feels ok and isn't as bad as some people make out. The graphics actually make it entertaining with explosions and stuff falling all over the place. The challenges are quite a laugh although not many of them. Overall, I liked it. Finished run through after 4 hours (non-completionist about 75%). So for $1 an hour I got my moneys worth so I'm happy.			",404,105,23,38,33,6,50

												I was torn whether or not to recommend this game. In the end the constant/random crashing put me over the edge. Urban Trial Freestyle isn't too bad of a game. The core things are there. The physics, upgrading your bike and the tracks are all good. I'm running Windows 8.1 64-bit and the games stability was marginal at best. Sometimes it would crash once and then play fine for an indefinite amount of time. Other times it would crash at random over and over again and I just had to give up that day. Not fun.It also crashed every single time I got a Steam card for the game while playing. I feel like the graphics engine wasn't optimized very well as I had to lower shadow settings and turn off AA. I have a GeForce GTX295. For the level of graphics in this game... it shouldn't be struggling at the max settings. I was able to get a constant 60FPS by lowering the shadow detail and turning off AA but i had to run it in 1920x1080. Speaking of resolution. I have two 1440p monitors and i seemed to get slightly better stability when i set my resolution to match what I’d launch the game at. It took me 10 hours to beat all the tracks, get all the cash bags and beat all the challenges. Pros-Nice looking graphics-Good physics-Entertaining levelsCons-Poorly optimized-Random/Constant crashes-Listening to the same, UNSKIPPABLE intro every time you start the gameIf you get this on sale for a dollar or two, it'll give you a bit of entertainment for your money. Anything higher than that I can't recommend due to stability/performance issues.3/10 Poor			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just like all the other angle and physics racing games. This one is a bit easier than others due to track layout, and you can take a beating without falling off the bike. Fun for a little bit then gets old fast. Not as fun as the other types of similar games.			",239,36,8,32,14,2,32

												Why do I want to aimlessly drive a motorcycle through the streets crashing dramatically? Because who doesn't love smashing and jumping around for points. Something about this game is exceedingly entertaining. It's very pick-up-and-play and allows for great replayability. There are similarly titled games by Ubisoft on Steam too that are just awful. The controls for those games are clunky. If you were disapointed by Ubisoft give this one a try. They got it right.			",2078,800,68,235,219,26,316

												Trials Evolution exists, Trials Fusion exists, ♥♥♥♥ this game.Yup, the Trials games (the real ones) are made by Evilsoft, but they are at least good games, this however is a mess that has you replaying (I'm taking a not so wild guess here after having played just over half of the game) 5-6 levels over and over again.Atrocious checkpoints on each one of those levels, and when you're racing a cpu ghost, which makes almost no mistakes, those checkpoints tend to ♥♥♥♥ you the eff off when they send you back 30 seconds.If you have this game already, let it chill in your library looking all pretty and adding that +1 to your overall game count, because that's the only thing it's good for, or torture yourself like I am, and get some playfire money if you're reading this brilliant review within a week of me writing it.Let me paint you a clear picture, if there were such a thing as an insult chart, ""go play Urban Trial Freestyle"" would be rated just above ""eat s#!t and die"".

												This is gonna be the obligatory comparison to Trials Evolution!Urban Trial Freestyle wins in dynamic maps with some cool slow-mo effects, smooth gameplay and surprisingly pretty sharp graphics, it also uses steamworks features.Cons: Had to use xpadder to map controls in my gamepad, it apparently only works without hiccups with the official 360 controller.  Content is low, doesnt take long to finish everything.Now when it comes to Trials Evolution it wins with much much more content, multiplayer servers and better physics. If Trials Evolution would use dynamic maps and steamwork features then it would be the obvious choice. But it doesnt!Overall UTF is a good game, i'll go as far to say that it was worth the preorder price ($12). But dont think it's worth more than that.			",237,11,34,19,11,1,25

												this is a really fun game if you're into the whole trials thing. it looks good and there's a lot going on on the levels as you're making your escape from the law. things go boom, break, catapult you into the air, etc. it might not have as much content as its bigger brothers (40 levels, 2 tutorials and 5 challenges altogether, and of those 40 about 25 are unique, the rest are the same with different conditions), but I found most of it really enjoyable, except the 'watch your head' type of obstacles and the really steep ones, those got on my nerves sometimes.initially I thought it'd be impossible (for me, at least) to unlock every level, as you need to get about 75% of the stars (that means 4-starring almost everything), but if I could do it, anybody can. also, money is short and you have to collect it from the levels, some are really well hidden too, but to be honest, I didn't really fool around with bike configurations, just bought and used what I could afford and I still managed, though I assume if I knew what I was doing it would've been an even better and more successful journey.either way, if you're looking for more trials gameplay, a cheaper alternative, or an introduction to the genre, pick it up, but there's also a demo to try if you're uncertain.

												This is pretty much the worst racing game I've ever played.  Most of the negative reviews I read focused on the game being a Trials clone, which wouldn't offend me in the least.  In fact, I found it to be more reminiscent of Trackmania.  The real issue is that the bike physics are garbage, the courses aren't well designed, doing well doesn't feel rewarding, and the player's character is a dope.  I'd also ding it for having your character start off naked instead of having at least basic protective gear - having to win races before you can wear a helmet is nonsensical, like so much else in this game.

												Urban Trials Freestyle – When this game first came out there where a lot of bad reviews even from those who haven't played it. The main complaints where that the game 'is a copy of Trials HD' which I think is ridiculous because all games copy of each other some how, this game still brought in the timed level and skill level which are great to try and get up the leaderboard and it has it's own maps, they aren't copied so you can just think of it as a map pack instead of raging about a game you haven't played. I have a major issue though, It's too easy, I’ve never completed a game on the first day I’ve had it since guitar hero. I got all the achievements and so there was nothing left for me to do but it is a good game and I do suggest that you try it out. The controls are easy to get used to (This includes Xbox controller and mouse/keyboard). It is a short game overall and it won't take you long to work your way through them but it would be better if they made an expansion pack or they make a new game that is a hell of a lot longer. It would make it better if they copied a map creator that is another thing that people brought up because once you complete the game then you have nothing to do, It has done nothing for me, I had fun at the time but now what? I still suggest you try this game, it still is good in my opinion but it could definitely be improved.			",89,9,13,1,10,0,10

												Urban Trial Freestyle is a fun little game, but compared to Trials Evolution - which it is obvious that Freestyle tried to mimic - it simply does not hold a candle. Here you have no multiplayer mode or custom track creator, the amount of tracks is disappointing, the customization system feels borderline meaningless and the gameplay feels too simple and casual. It’s not a terrible game, but it adds nothing new to the table to weigh up for its lackluster features. With better alternatives around that do everything better, Urban Trial Freestyle ends up being a pointless purchase at its current price.2.5/5Read more:http://pixeljudge.com/en/reviews/urban-trial-freestyle/ ",329,55,5,29,30,2,35

												Personal YES for this game. I did really enjoy it.Okay, so where to start? Basically, I'm not quite a fan of any extreme sports games, well I am, but I don't play them too much. My last game was Gravity Defied I guess .-.So, this game pretty much delivers. I didn't expect it to be any good, but that game just dropped my expectations to tha ground.First of all, graphics is pretty decent. I did enjoy all these dystopian pictures that the developers showed in the game, classically, about the police, fire everywhere and some kind of nuclear war o3o, especially in the last partThe gameplay itself is pretty nicely done, physics is decent, and it's quite easy to play, since you need only 4 keys and within an hour you're gonna be pro at this game, of course of you aren't a lobster.Challenge in this game is pretty fun, getting points, and stuff. The easiest way to win is for sure time challenge, that I've won several times there lel. It's not too much of popular games these days so you do have a chance to get on top of board even not being pro at extreme sports games.The Challenge Mode isn't really too interesting...worth playing once or twice though.But I'll be sure to play story mode again and again to get mroe stars and earn more recordsSo, all in all, this is not yet perfect game, but rather decent, sometimes it's ♥♥♥♥ed up and you just don't understand how to do some sh*t at some points, but it really delivers, so8.8/10Recommended for fans.

												Game rocks! If you like driving games and/or where you get to do tricks on a motorcycle, this is awesome. I haven't played one like this before (and I've really combed through the Steam game library) so not sure how to describe it. It isn't frustrating, it's just tons of fun. Like I've said in my other reviews, I like games where I can zone out at times and just become absorbed. And choose whether or not to just relax - or play hard, being challenged. This is one that does that. You learn new tricks as you go along. New environments. I'm still newish to Steam (one year so far) but I've tried out a lot of driving games and this is one of my top five favorites. I think I paid for it 1/2 price else I wouldn't have bought it. However, if I knew what it was going to be like, I would have agreed it was well worth full price. I think if they had a demo to give people a taste, even more people would buy it.

												This game is basically Trials but better. This game handles better, has upgrades that do a lot for you, and is based on competition.

												Where do I start with this game? I had purchased it during the Steam summer sale for only 99 cents. In my mind I thought ""Hmmmm how bad could this game actually be for only 99 cents?"" and man, is this game bad. I loved Trials Evolution, that game was a masterpiece, but this game is nowhere near sharing the name Trials.When launching the game and arriving at the title screen you see the hip rebelious biker dude and hear that the police are after him for tresspassing with his bike.(zZzZZZZzZZzZzz)The gameplay of this game is not fun. Repetative levels and annyoing characters that say the same lines over and over during the levels. ""FREEZE POLICE"" says the police officer as you cruise by the 10 different groups of them each level. But the funny thing is if you stop in front of the police, they dont do anything. They just roll around and act like they're going to do something as you are at a standstill.While playing the single player, the goal is to collect the stars from each level and using them to unlock the next level. BUT, you have to play the same level 2 or 3 times playing the different ""modes"" to gain the plentiful amount of stars needed. The handling of the bike is way too easy. This game has no challenge what so ever.I'm surprised that this game is being sold for $10 now (even at $15). If this game were still 99 cents, I would not recommend it to anyone. In the end, this game screams of a iOS or Android game for your cellular device. How did this game make it to consoles and even steam?			",51,5,1,0,1,0,2

												Urban Trial Freestyle follows a very simple concept that has been used before in flash games, but includes more detailed levels and better graphics. I started playing it without any expectations, and really enjoyed it. It can be completed in four or five hours, but collecting all the money, getting 5 stars on all missions, and beating your friends' scores can keep you playing for longer.The graphics are good, and the 2.5D design works well with the dynamically changing levels. Each level responds as you drive through it, usually with police getting in your way or structures collapsing to form ramps. The one level design element that I found annoying is the jumping platforms, which are introduced later in the game, and seem to be designed to kill the rider repeatedly rather than propel him to new areas.There are four tracks in each of the five worlds, and also two brief tutorials and five challenges (each of which has its own rules and its own track). Each track also has two modes, race and stunt, which are unlocked separately.In race mode, you'll race against the fastest ghost of whichever leaderboard you have selected: global, friends, or self. I felt that global was out of my league, but I had a lot of fun trying to beat my friends' fastest records.The stunts consist of long jumps, high jumps, precision jumps, and speed checks at certain parts of each track. The rider will do tricks during many of the stunts, but these are purely cosmetic and happen automatically. You can instantly return to the previous checkpoint with no direct penalty, which is great for trying to beat your friends' high scores in stunt mode.Each track has $5000 in bags of $500, $1000, or $2000 hidden along it. This money can be used to buy functional upgrades for your bike or cosmetic upgrades for your rider. There aren't many customization options, so I found the bike upgrades and rider appearance system lacking.The bike's engine noise gets repetitive quickly, but you can turn the sound down in the options menu. The soundtrack is decent, but nothing outstanding.			",1998,773,79,198,230,21,315

												first fact: it´s not as good as trials (gold). but it´s a fun game, especially the challenges (farest jump, highest jump, highest speed & accuracy of jump) make the game very entertaining and you always want to go for another try to beat at least your own record. just don´t expect the complexity and the challenge the trials series offers. to make it clear: if you wanna go for a cool motocross game buy trials gold version (haven´t bought fusion yet, so i can´t recommend that version). if you´re looking for another motocross game, you can´t go wrong here, if you don´t expect too much since its rather an arcade game play. if it´s on sale and you like motocross games: go for it! :-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wasn't all that inspired initially with the gameplay of Urban Trial Freestyle. The overall motorcycle control certainly feels a little shallow and the game does its best to focus your attention on environmental animations to hide that lack of gameplay. I mean you essentially accelerate, brake, and lean forward or backward on your motorcycle--and that's it.The courses are short and there are time trials where you race against a ghost rider as well as stunt trials where you score points to achieve stars which unlock more levels. There are moneybags placed throughout the levels which after collected can be used to purchase bike upgrades or clothing. The game can be a little frustrating since some of the moneybags are located in areas that require bike upgrades so there can be a sense of having to backtrack to an earlier track to get the remaining moneybags after you acquire enough money to purchase the necessary upgrades.After giving the game a bit more play time, I do find it to be somewhat fun and enjoyable. The challenge courses are interesting. And getting maximum stars isn't all that easy so there is some challenge to the game as well. Overall, it's a game I would play again, albeit in moderation.

												Loads of fun.  Good physics, not perfectly realistic, but good enough to make you feel like you truly have control of your bike.  The courses are challenging enough and offer enough variety to keep your interested.  The game pushes you to try harder and focus, but it's not hard enough that you'll pull your hair out.  The atmosphere is gritty in this version, but it doesn't take away from the fact that you are an acrobatic bike rider and running a course with either speed, or agilitiy, and sometimes both.  The challenges offer more replayability, and they can be very difficult.  For a good price, when on sale, this is a great game to pick up.  There's just nothing more fun than to watch how much you can beat up your driver, there are times where it really looks like that must have hurt.  :)			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

												About the most realistic motorcycle simulation game on the market for the super serious who love to feel the geforce as they lean into the turns. Seriously though about everything we ever wanted in the NES excitebike game minus the 3 other racers that wouldn't really make sense for this title. Get it on sale though because the lack of need to balance the bike with the right toggle stick that you might expect of freestyle type games gives it a beyond gravity one dimensional feel at times. Still very interesting if your looking to add a little something different to your collection, or to make funny videos down the road. Also as every DMV should have this game as part of their motorcycle trainging manual guide because so many of the hazards could occur in real world situations. Especially in your dreams after drinking all night.:csgogun:			",472,106,24,40,22,2,54

												Don't buy this game! The single player part is not in any way better than what you'll get in the Trials series (Trials evolution, Trials fusion, etc.). Also, the single player campaign in this game is monotounous and short - took me about 4 hours to complete. While the Trials series then let's you play thousands of user made tracks, for free, this game doesn't have that option. This means that you're basically spending your money on 4 hours of not very fun gameplay. Buy Trials fusion instead, it just came out, and it doesn't cost that much more.			",16,0,1,1,5,0,7

												This game feels like a quick little cash grab when you compare it to Trails Evoultion Gold. It is was shorter the with no where near the same amount of levels. With no good difficulty curb for the levels as you unlock them they are all rather easy. Worst is you can tell they cut corners with repeating levels, you do a time run in a level then 2 levels later it is the exact same but with a different task. The contorl of the bikes also feels a lot less challenging making the experience less fun. No custom level maker (that i could see) shortening the life span even more so. If you're going to buy a Trails game your money will be better spent on Trails Evoultion Gold.			",442,92,7,42,40,6,80

												Even though I got it knowing that it would be a very simple and very casual game, I still can't recommend it.The gameplay is somewhat what I expected. I played the heck out of those free 2d bike trial browser games. And I expected the gameplay to be similar, and I wasn't wrong. But despite the graphics and fireworks, Urban Trial Freestyle manages to be more simpel and to dumb down the 2d free browser games.One of the main problems, imho, are the levels. They are too simple, too short, too unchallenging. Yes the random challenges are cool (highest jump, longest jump, whatever), but truth still is that you spend most of the (very short) level pressing accelerator and watching the fireworks. But the main problem for me was: It gave me massive motion sickness. I've made sure to have 60hz stable, vsync, I've played with other settings, no joy. I'm not sure if it's the 2.5d concept or if it's something else in the graphics or optimization but the bottom line is... I just can't play it. And I'm actually a bit glad about it.I've asked for a refund but I doubt I'm getting it. At least it was dirt-cheap.			",79,16,17,1,13,3,15

												I recommend this game hesitantly, and I say hesitantly b/c you should not pay much more than the current summer sale (Jun 2014) price ($0.99) .Let's start with the obvious. This game is an unabashed knock-off of Trials, the much heralded game which is literally the exact same thing. You're a motorbike rider trying to get through an obstacle course where the handling and physics of the bike are the crux to passing them. I look at this game as a cover version of a popular song. Rarely are cover versions better than the original, but once in a while an artist will do very well and have a hit of their own on their hands. This is not a hit, but it's at the very least curiously listenable.There is not a lot of customization in this game. There is basically one bike that you upgrade various parts of using money you collect on the various tracks. What I liked:- I liked the background effects of the tracks. The NPCs include cops, various passersby, and occasionally people will try to throw things at you. There's even some explosions. - It was $0.99 and it drops cards. - Relatively small (about 800 mb) download.- Its challenging.What I didn't like- It lacks depth. The tracks are repeated at the higher levels in places.- Occasionally the bike handling/physics is wonky.- The braking and reverse mechanic has to be used sometimes to get awkwardly placed money bags and can totally kill your time/momentum.You can do a lot worse than spending a buck on this game. It's an unapologetic knock-off of the brilliant Trials series (the latest game in that series is Trials: Fusion) and it succeeds in replicating the gameplay of that series to a point. However, at the end of the day, why play this when I can just play Trials? It does nothing that series does better.That being said, it's a buck, and with four card drops, you basically can get this game for $0.40 if you choose to sell those drops, even less if you get a foil.Don't expect anything great, but if you know what you're getting into, there's a bit of entertainment to be found with this game.If you do find that you like this game, or at the at the very least how it plays, do yourself a favor and pick up one of the entries in the Trials series.

YouTube™ Video: Cheap PC Games: Urban Trial Freestyle Review

Urban Trial Freestyle won't set the world on fire, but I think you still have to play it. It's certenly draws inspiration from Trials, some may say it's copying it and so what? It's good game.The game is console port and a great one. I even try playing with the keyboard. It's fine, but the prefered method is a controller. And with him playing is great. If you make mistake, it's entirly your fault.The game have limited video options – resolution, V-sync, Shadow quality and AA. The game is definitely not ugly, it just good, but not great. But so many things happen on screen and you won't notice textures or other things. You will be concentrated over the gameplay mostly. The game may not be the prettiest, but it have so many details on background and foreground. You see lake, big skyscrapers and so on.Urban Trial Freestyle is side-scroller racing game with a bike. You hate to get from point A to point B, avoiding tons of obstacles. That's it. The level design is great. You will ride through forest, slums, highway with a lot of crashed cars, on top of buildings, high in the sky, on a train, in a train depot, on a dam, through an office and so on. There are some level that feel like you are in a hollywood movie. Police is chasing you, explosions everywhere, highspeed and dangerous jumps. It's like Michael Bay was directing. The thing what I like a lot here is this – there is always something going on on the foreground and background. Worker doing his thing, exploding helicopter, even a train crash. They may distract you, so bear that in mind. Sometimes those events may cause an obsticale to apper or the ground to rise. What i'm trying to tell you is the developer put a lot of thoughts in the level design.When you finish a track you will be rated with stars and money. Sometimes only when you get 5 you will get cash. For unlocking new tracks you have to gather certain number of stars. Here there are two type of races – time attack and tricks. Tricks are more interesting. You don't race with a clock, although when you finish the race, the remaining time will count as points. Here you have to do highest jump, precise aim, highest speed or rotating the bike. Bigger the achievment, more points you'll get. There is  a green line to show you record for that track, so there is replay value.You have only one bike, but you can buy upgrades for him. They are pretty straight foreward and all have pluses and minuses. Buy a bigger engine, handling will decrease and so on. You can dress the biker, but i'm not in to this kind of thing.As far as the sound design, there isn't much to say. The effects are like exploisions, sirens, collapsing road, crashing or crumbling are okay, but I don't like engines. They are weak.Music is okay. Sometimes it's jazzy, other fast and electronic, but overall you may not notice it that much in the middle of this chaos. I think I won't listening it outside of the game.When you're done with the main game you can tackle the Challenges. I like the a lot. They are total of 5 and you have to do different things from the main game. Shoot the biker as far as you can, drive as far as possible with limited fuel, platforming with the bike to collect signs for points and my favourite – the track where you can change gravity. There have to be more tracks like this.The biggest sin here is the lacking of level editor. This is essential for the longevity of the game. It's such a shame. Other small problem is the weird 40-50 fps I get without recording. I have mid-range machine and I think should get more fps. I'm not sure if the problem is on my side or it's the games optimizations. But the fps stay mostly about 50 and they rarely go under 40.As a whole the game is great. I haven't played Trials and I can't compare them. I supose RedLynx games is superior, but this game is worth playing. If you don't want to deal with Uplay or Trials is pricey for you, jump on here. It took me around 7 h to beat it and here you have enough replay value. If solid controls, good graphics, great level design, and extra challenges sounds good to you, buy it. I definitely recommend it.			",310,73,9,43,10,2,35

												Fun. Replayable. Worth it.You may think you need to know more than that, but you don't really.There's plenty of tracks, they're well made, they're both challenging AND fun, there's plenty to achieve & find, and you will keep coming back to it time after time. Even when you're done with it you're still likely to want to have a play once in a while.There's wheel, chassis, engine upgrades, which obviously make the bike lighter, faster etc; but also change the handling of the bike. The controls are simple enough to jump straight into yet the maps & physics require mastery.If you beat your friends at any challenge your pic goes up on the in-game billboards so they all see it as they ride-by & fail. ;)I can't say whether it is better or worse than others in the series, but on it's own I can't find anything to complain about.It's worth the price & if on sale it's a no-brainer.

												i don't know why do i have to collect the stars and unlock different maps like what i'm doing in the mobile phone games. Can i pay the money to unlock these maps? Actually this game is just a mini game, you don't have many choices on choosing the style of your motor bike and your cloth ( maybe you can unlock more, because i didn't finish this whole game ), so i don't know why do they call it ""Freestyle"". In other words, it only costs 99 cents, and has awesome graphics. it was really cool as i thought when i was playing it at first time. But then, i started getting tired to play the map again, again and again and still can't get enough stars ( damn skill ). i was impatient and hoped to play every map in this game quickly. it's vain, and it's why this game had low rating. If you are a stubborn warrior and want to beat these hard challanges, just try it. Me? Just surrendering.			",128,23,5,9,16,2,23

Then theres the sounds, with the bike sounding like an irritated wasp in a tin can, the tin-like explosion, and the 4 soundbites of 'cops' (which are purely backdrops, serving no actual threat to the player) shouting 'freeze' or 'hey you'. All in all, if you want to play a balance game, find a flash game. It'll be a lot cheaper, a lot better, and not have you reaching for headache tablets.			",190,24,8,19,27,2,35

												Don't be fooled by the glamorous graphics and the shiney levels.... This game subtly reminds me of one of those crappy ps2 games that you are so siked for and end up becoming disappointed after the first few levels.  First off the levels make no sense... you ride on a pipe and jump to a platform that launches you into a container that either A. ends up killing you, enabling you to hit the spacebar ( this becomes your friend ) or B. exit out of the game in a furious rage.  The upgrading abilities are far from satisfying.  You can upgrade your engine at  the price of having worse handling, or you can upgrade your chassis at the price of having slower speeds.  There is always something for something and there's only 3 upgrades per area.  Getting money to upgrade is far from ""fun"" ( not sure why fun is quoted ... maybe because that's more fun than getting money in this game ).  I digress ... the money is located in bags throughout each level.  You can only collect them once. That is the only way it is obtained.  You can spend your money on helmets and clothes, but then you won't have any for engines, tires, or chassis. Some areas of levels are impassable unless under some freak of nature miracle that you hit something a certain way to do something to get you passed it.  The constant reminder that someone online has trumped your score and that you keep getting either 3 stars or 4 stars average is also very demeaning and makes you feel like the whole game is an unsuccesful attempt to have fun.  It's almost like you are excited to go on vacation with your family and they end up just making you more miserable than your 9-5 job.

There are few upgrades, and half the levels are the same as the other half, except that they add ghost drivers. The motorcycle noises are annoying.

												I actually enjoyed my experience while I played this game. It is similar to Trials but its not. Its hard to explain unless you play it. Its cheap and enjoyable. I managed to get it for $1 when it was on sale. It was worth that dollar. It is a cheap and fun game about bikes. 9/10 I need to play more.			",45,4,1,0,8,0,0

They are really challenging but very rewarding.  If you want something to get your teeth into and master look no further.			",464,147,9,48,66,7,61

												Don't be fooled by the glamorous graphics and the shiney levels.... This game subtly reminds me of one of those crappy ps2 games that you are so siked for and end up becoming disappointed after the first few levels.  First off the levels make no sense... you ride on a pipe and jump to a platform that launches you into a container that either A. ends up killing you, enabling you to hit the spacebar ( this becomes your friend ) or B. exit out of the game in a furious rage.  The upgrading abilities are far from satisfying.  You can upgrade your engine at  the price of having worse handling, or you can upgrade your chassis at the price of having slower speeds.  There is always something for something and there's only 3 upgrades per area.  Getting money to upgrade is far from ""fun"" ( not sure why fun is quoted ... maybe because that's more fun than getting money in this game ).  I digress ... the money is located in bags throughout each level.  You can only collect them once. That is the only way it is obtained.  You can spend your money on helmets and clothes, but then you won't have any for engines, tires, or chassis. Some areas of levels are impassable unless under some freak of nature miracle that you hit something a certain way to do something to get you passed it.  The constant reminder that someone online has trumped your score and that you keep getting either 3 stars or 4 stars average is also very demeaning and makes you feel like the whole game is an unsuccesful attempt to have fun.  It's almost like you are excited to go on vacation with your family and they end up just making you more miserable than your 9-5 job.  If you think I just don't like the game because I can't play it then try it for yourself.  You'll realize...			",88,47,4,4,14,1,0

												Urban Trial Freestyle has a tinge of ""time waster"" about it, one of those games you can play for a few minutes here and there, especially with the extra Challenges, which are ridiculous fun.

												Urban Trial Freestyle is a poor mans Trials HD/Evolution the general feel of the motorbike make it seem quite heavy whereas although Trials felt sometimes like you were bouncing all over the place at least that was useful for harder obstacles. This game offer just like 6 different stages that don't seem to get any harder so there's not really a learning curve which is quite disappointing froma  game that wants to compete with Trials, its just getting from point a to bIts incredibly easy and doesn't explain the objectives very well which are scattered around in certain levels. It hides moneybags around the level to improve your bike, because thats a great system find the collectibles so you can accomplish the objectives to a higher degree. The level design isn't fantastic either where some obstacles don't properly align with others. There's alot going on in the background but when you're trying to focus on what your bikes doing the background action can a little jarring and distracting. Graphically its pretty much the same as Trials. Really the only benefit is at least you don't have to use Uplay but this is such a mediocre game, get Trials really get Trials its not a very good port but its still better than this.

												Okay concept combined with cool dynamic maps, held together by a horrible PC port and rubbishy vehicle upgrade systems.. the game doesn't really hold any explanations of how to play, it has the absolute WORST feel of any game I have ever played (no decent background music, just the horrible tinny sound of your bike, which sounds like a nitrous buggy that has been burned out), and to top it all off the game is quite short.  Definitely would not recommend, even after buying during a sale for $4.			",400,93,11,34,42,7,29

												I bought this for 99c thinking it'd be the dollar store version of Trials.  Well ... it is, but it's actually worse that that.  It's kind of like playing Trials if they hired the physics dude from Bad Rats to design the bike contols. Some levels have some interesting design, but it doesn't matter becuase of the ""Absolutley Terrible Gameplay"" feature they added, but forgot to mention on the store page.Stay ... away ... seriously.

												A Long Ride Away From Being Good!I must confess that i was not expecting much when i bought this game, frankly, i wouldn't of purchased it if it were not for the extreme reduction of its price during the sale. But, Trials being a fairly successful franchise if you can call it that, i was not worried in the fact of putting some cash down for it, and it was not regretted either.Trials is a fun arcade styled puzzle game in which you as the player must ride different forms of motorcycles through obstacles, competing for a fast time, and gathering up the much wanted collectibles along the way. Trials has no true depth, but its not supposed to, and that's what makes it a great play. Urban Trials Freestyle is one of those games where you just play for the sake of having some real fun, slowly getting more and more addicted to collecting points, and upgrading your bike. However, being a very repetitive style of game, it does not take long for you as the player to get very bored of the same old Trials gameplay. In fact, as you get further on in the game, i found that it stops getting fun at all, and the game becomes more of a chore or task. I found myself leaving this game because of that very reason, and believe me, once you leave a game like this, you will find it incredibly hard to come back to. The replayability of this game is downright disgraceful, not to mention the lifespan that this game will have in you library, not very long indeed! The game has various levels and stages to get stuck into, and even if you think you will be able to get through all of them and complete it, well i would say good luck to you aha. Its a small game, but Steam only asks you for a small price to pay for it, and so its a reasonable purchase. Urban Trials Freestyle is a game thats generally going to give you a few hours of fun, but lacks the effort to do further, when you buy this (you should only get this when the price is very cheap), do realise that its a game thats just going to be a few hours of fun. Overall:+ Fun game to play for a few hours+ Can be great for a completionist+ Good Trials Game- Very repetitive- Boring after a few hours of gameplay- Terrible upgrade system- Generally becomes a chore to playAlright 5.5/10That goes it for my short Urban Trials Freestyle Steam Review.Thanks,The-Sentinel-Gamer			",94,7,2,21,6,2,41

You use 4 keys the whole game and I am quite sure that you could go through the whole game using 2 keys. No real story is present within the game and you are just left to run over obstacles through a city all day. 100% do not reccomend this game to anybody.			",87,10,2,2,8,1,2

												I was hoping for some kind of freestyle dirtbike game on par with DiRT. This is a lot more like Motocross Maniacs for the Game Boy, except MM was a little more open about how you could attack a track.This is linear--it's literally linear, you cannot steer left or right, and most tracks have three or four score zones and that's about it. So much for freestyle when you're only scored on how well you score in each of the designated zones, and how quickly you get through a track.The environments do look cool, and the interactions are kind of fun, but in general I feel like something's missing from the game, like it's a minigame from a much bigger, better dirtbike game.

												Urban Trial Freestyle is a very bad port with terrible performance issues and no reboundable controls. You can't use the mouse on anything which would be nice to use instead of the control scheme that isn't well thought out (function keys to navigate). Despite stating that, the game definitely feels a lot better with a controller which shouldn't be the case considering I am playing on a PC. The level design seems to get distracting sometimes due to objects blending in making me miss a crucial jump. The bikes feel very unnatural which also ruins the game for me. All this being said, the only recommendation I can make is the price it is on sale for and for a dollar, you get a game that you can spend short amounts of time on but for full price, Urban Trial Freestyle is 100% not worth it.

												Obviously this game is a Trials clone, but somehow the things that are original in this game are done decently enough to make me want to keep playing, such as the challenges and the dynamic tracks. There is no real distinction between the tracks though. Sometimes the feel of each of the tracks seemed to mesh together so that it almost felt as though the same 3 tracks were repeated throughout the game. The controls are rather stiff and the physics don't seem consistent at all. If this had been DLC or a new mode for an actual Trials game with the Trials physics, UTF might be more enjoyable. But for only .99 cents, I would say it is worth it.			",228,72,14,36,16,3,45

												I love Trials games. My first was Trials 2: Second Edition back in like 2008. I got the demo, played the crap out of it, and bought the game. Many hours went into it, and I was really excited when I saw Trials Evolution: Gold Edition was coming out, and bought it as soon as it did. This game was AMAZING. The soundtrack was fantastic, the graphics were great, the rider customization was fun, the tracks were awesome, it was, overall, far and above Trials 2: Second Edition's minimalistic style. Then I saw Urban Trial Freestyle, and bought that. Great game, though short, and nowhere near as awesome as Trials Evolution. The addition of on-track items to pick up (cash bags) was great, rider customization options are good, the tracks and physics are excellent, and the soundtrack is great. This is a really fun game, but feels a little cheesey compared to Trials Evolution: Gold Edition.			",80,3,6,2,5,0,5

												I think this might of been ported onto or from mobile but that's just speculation, it's roughly the quality of an IOS game but a good one. In the sense there are levels which get progressively harder and you upgrade your bike to make it progressively better. That being said this is much better than the games like it on IOS that I have tried. But it's no comparison to the AAA version. But the core gameplay mechanics are the same, so if you want more of the same then here it is if you enjoyed the web based version this is like a super deluxe version of that.

												Urban Trial Freestyle follows a very simple concept that has been used before in flash games, but includes more detailed levels and better graphics. I started playing it without any expectations, and really enjoyed it. It can be completed in four or five hours, but collecting all the money, getting 5 stars on all missions, and beating your friends' scores can keep you playing for longer.The graphics are good, and the 2.5D design works well with the dynamically changing levels. Each level responds as you drive through it, usually with police getting in your way or structures collapsing to form ramps. The one level design element that I found annoying is the jumping platforms, which are introduced later in the game, and seem to be designed to kill the rider repeatedly rather than propel him to new areas.There are four tracks in each of the five worlds, and also two brief tutorials and five challenges (each of which has its own rules and its own track). Each track also has two modes, race and stunt, which are unlocked separately.In race mode, you'll race against the fastest ghost of whichever leaderboard you have selected: global, friends, or self. I felt that global was out of my league, but I had a lot of fun trying to beat my friends' fastest records.The stunts consist of long jumps, high jumps, precision jumps, and speed checks at certain parts of each track. The rider will do tricks during many of the stunts, but these are purely cosmetic and happen automatically. You can instantly return to the previous checkpoint with no direct penalty, which is great for trying to beat your friends' high scores in stunt mode.Each track has $5000 in bags of $500, $1000, or $2000 hidden along it. This money can be used to buy functional upgrades for your bike or cosmetic upgrades for your rider. There aren't many customization options, so I found the bike upgrades and rider appearance system lacking.The bike's engine noise gets repetitive quickly, but you can turn the sound down in the options menu. The soundtrack is decent, but nothing outstanding.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Make no mistake: this is Trials' angsty younger brother trying to show off and be like his cool big bro. The voice acting is cringey, with the biker yelling appreciation or disappointment to the player depending on his performance. The sound design is none too great either, with the bike's engine sounding like it was recorded into an iPhone's mic in a bathroom and not always seeming to sync up with what the bike is actually doing.That being said, this is a worthwhile, fun game. The graphics might not be the best, but the level design is brilliant, both in scenery / surrounding events and the gameplay itself. As others have mentioned, it lacks some challenge; you're unlikely to spend 50 faults on one particular section of track like you would in a Trials game, for example. It nevertheless makes for a fun experience.Something Urban Trials Freestyle does differently to the Trials games is incorporating in-level challenges. For instance, midway through a level you may be asked to make the longest possible jump or do as many flips as possible. This adds a nice, additional bit of variety to the game. There are also some collectable moneybags throughout the levels which you use to upgrade your bike, though whether this is a help or a hindrance to your playstyle is up to you; typically, they are not too out of the way, and you are encouraged to make separate runs of the tracks for performance and money-collecting.Overall, I'd say this is a good game, but maybe get it on sale.

												For what it is worth the game can offer you a lot of bang for your buck. It is a great attempt at a trials fusion style game. It's a great game for anyone who can plug in and play with a controller. There is a variety of differant levels however most of them feel the same. I would reccomend you pick it up at the moment as it on sale for £0.69 and for a casual game you can play every now and again it is worth the price tag.			",110,11,4,12,8,4,7

												Urban Trial Freestyle follows a very simple concept that has been used before in flash games, but includes more detailed levels and better graphics. I started playing it without any expectations, and really enjoyed it. It can be completed in four or five hours, but collecting all the money, getting 5 stars on all missions, and beating your friends' scores can keep you playing for longer.The graphics are good, and the 2.5D design works well with the dynamically changing levels. Each level responds as you drive through it, usually with police getting in your way or structures collapsing to form ramps. The one level design element that I found annoying is the jumping platforms, which are introduced later in the game, and seem to be designed to kill the rider repeatedly rather than propel him to new areas.There are four tracks in each of the five worlds, and also two brief tutorials and five challenges (each of which has its own rules and its own track). Each track also has two modes, race and stunt, which are unlocked separately.In race mode, you'll race against the fastest ghost of whichever leaderboard you have selected: global, friends, or self. I felt that global was out of my league, but I had a lot of fun trying to beat my friends' fastest records.The stunts consist of long jumps, high jumps, precision jumps, and speed checks at certain parts of each track. The rider will do tricks during many of the stunts, but these are purely cosmetic and happen automatically. You can instantly return to the previous checkpoint with no direct penalty, which is great for trying to beat your friends' high scores in stunt mode.Each track has $5000 in bags of $500, $1000, or $2000 hidden along it. This money can be used to buy functional upgrades for your bike or cosmetic upgrades for your rider. There aren't many customization options, so I found the bike upgrades and rider appearance system lacking.The bike's engine noise gets repetitive quickly, but you can turn the sound down in the options menu. The soundtrack is decent, but nothing outstanding.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I think this might of been ported onto or from mobile but that's just speculation, it's roughly the quality of an IOS game but a good one. In the sense there are levels which get progressively harder and you upgrade your bike to make it progressively better. That being said this is much better than the games like it on IOS that I have tried. But it's no comparison to the AAA version. But the core gameplay mechanics are the same, so if you want more of the same then here it is if you enjoyed the web based version this is like a super deluxe version of that.

												urban trial freestyle (utf) is one of those ""tilt bike, dont crash"" games. this game is very similar in gameplay to ubisofts trials, so a lot of people might critizize that. but you have to remember: trials wasnt the first either (exitebike, anyone?) utf is kinda short lived, and is not as challenging as one hopes. if you want a challenge look elsewhere (like trials.) however, utf is $10.00 (i got it for $0.99) where as trials is about twenty, making this a much more afordable and accesible option. so in price and gameplay id give this a 8/10.

												If you are looking for a cheap alternative to the Trials formula, this is the game for you! Whilst it does not have the same amount of content and replayability that Trials has, it offers fun gameplay with very creative environments filled with crazy background nonsense like helicopters and ships crashing all over the place! It is not as challenging as Trials is, and the music, graphics, vehicle customisation, and physics are all sub-par to Trials, BUT, overall, it is still a fun game and can be picked up for a very cheap price during any major Steam sale.

												TL;DR: Casual BMX game that's more about collecting collectibles and getting from point A to B than doing tricks.  Not a bad game but ultimately too simple for me.  Good game to get for $1 just to pad your games library and to play for maybe 1 hour.Rest of the review:Urban Trial Freestyle is a pretty game.  The visual effects and overall presentation are superb!  It has vehicular wrecks and explosions galore.  You will see amusement park horror shows under city streets and physics-based objects rolling around on every level.  You may think a lot of what happens is scripted, but from what I've played, a lot of it is actually different each time you play.  The dynamic physics-driven levels are amusing and eye-catching at the same time.The controls are simple, and the Xbox 360 controller is fully supported.			",571,115,13,72,58,7,60

												Ok wow. I've never played a game that truly represents the Urban Streets as well as this. Though at times the romance between Chet and Barb get overwhealming the extensive gun play and gore balance it out. This one time my friend did a marijuana brownie and I felt like I was in one of those BET movies ya, know. Further more in the level 1 There was a clown and he pops up and it made me crash and I wasn't mad, I was scared and I feel like that's a great representation of the urban lifestlyle. Also on the level 4 your in a vast forest and that's pretty urban too I guess.     So here's to trials the Game of the Year 2015			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A nice little game that i played on the PS Vita. It's kinda the same port from the vita, ps3, xbox and iOS version and for me to get it on sale? It's not so bad! Give it a try.			",474,91,15,66,23,5,53

												Decent graphics. The game is just borring. You can find similiar games for free that are much more enjoyable. Levels are uninspired and quite a bit depends on pure luck. Do not recomend to buy for full price.			",362,140,5,46,22,2,42

												For $0.99 I found it worth it since I wanted a game I could play in short bursts. The game provides that, but the ragdolling is a bit much and sometimes it feels way too easy to bash your head in. I like that the cash added some depth and replayability with the option to upgrade parts and perform better with the new parts. Overall, I enjoy it for the price I got it for, but I prefer the Joe Danger games with their cartoony aesthetic but deeper gameplay with ducking and editing tracks during the run.

												Ok, this game is good, played first on PS Vita. Nice graphics and physics, it reminds me of on old game called Elasto Mania. Don't know if any of you know that game =) I got it on sale for 1 euro, best bargain of my life. Recommended!!!!			",101,9,8,18,5,0,9

												I picked this up for $.99 and it is worth more.  It's very challenging and loads of fun for hours.  It's all about balance with your bike to pull some of these tricks off.  If you like the Trials games, you will love this game.  In my opinion, this is better than trials with the balancing being spot on and the challenges are real.  Patience & skill win you the gold.

												I normally don't really care that much when a game draws a LOT of inspiration from another, but this is just abysmal. It's essentially a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ version of Trials, some of the tracks are decently designed but the actual physics of the bike (y'know, that thing that the entire game is based around) are heavy, clunky, and awkward. I got this game on sale for a buck and I still feel ripped off. Do not buy this game.			",681,135,17,53,41,3,62

												Ok wow. I've never played a game that truly represents the Urban Streets as well as this. Though at times the romance between Chet and Barb get overwhealming the extensive gun play and gore balance it out. This one time my friend did a marijuana brownie and I felt like I was in one of those BET movies ya, know. Further more in the level 1 There was a clown and he pops up and it made me crash and I wasn't mad, I was scared and I feel like that's a great representation of the urban lifestlyle. Also on the level 4 your in a vast forest and that's pretty urban too I guess.     So here's to trials the Game of the Year 2015			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
