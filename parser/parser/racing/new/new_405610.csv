												I thought I'd give this a try, seeing how it's only $2. Unfortunately you get what you pay for and this game was sadly not particularly good. The gameplay is very simple, as demonstrated in the trailer on Steam. But that's also all there's to it: a very light shoot 'em up.The game is incredibly repetitive. Monsters come at you from the exact same angles every few seconds, making the game more of a pattern recognition exercise than anything. You have a basic attack that you can pretty much spam continuously and a whirlwind attack that needs to be charged but only kills certain enemies. The lack of a health bar, score meter or progress meter to the next boss is very annoying.Graphically there's really nothing to it. Playing it full screen is not recommended, as it makes all the ugly stand out.There's also not much sound. Aside from the looping organ music, the sound assets seem limited to a whopping 3 sound bites.			",104,66,3,23,14,1,30

												Where should I even start? The campaign mode is terrible. It has 3 levels, all of them which have a 10-minute long obstacle run that inevitably gets boring, frustrating and repetitive, followed by a boss fight that can be ended in as short as 15 seconds if you get some lucky shots and if you attack right off the bat. Besides the campaign mode, the current version offers survial mode, which is basically an endless torture of the same repetitive patterns of enemies and obstacles, the only difference being that bosses appear every 60 seconds. I'll be blunt about the mechanics: they just look like the developer/s wasted more time on prolonging the idiotic obstacle runs rather than actually working on the diversity of the game. The only things you can do are move left, right, and a tiny bit forward and attack in 2 ways: the normal, projectile attack and the whirlwind attack, which needs a second or so to charge and makes you invulnerable for a short period of time while also killing enemies in a very short range around you. That's literally the whole game. I wouldn't be bashing the lack of diversity of the game (it's normal in a game made in unity and with a cheap price tag) if it weren't for the awfully long levels. The enemies you will encounter are gargoyles, some banshees, wolves (most annoying enemy), and skeletal hands randomly placed in your path, while the bosses are cheap nicknames given to Nosferatu (The Phantom), The Headless Horseman (The Horseman) and Dracula (The Count, if I'm not mistaken), which have the same pattern of attacks over and over again, the only thing distinguishing them from the normal enemies being the increased number of hits required to take them down. A thing that I quite liked was the art style, I have to say that it turned out pretty well in my opinon. I certainly think that the game can be improved a lot and that an updated version with some fixes of the minor bugs in this one and added content (might as well have a bigger price, but I think it would be worth it) would have a pretty nice succes among the indie lovers. I can't reccomend it in its current state, maybe only for the trading cards and achievements (it will be a pain in the a** to get them all, trust me), but I do certainly hope that the game is not left unattended by the devs.TL;DR: A cheap game that might be worth getting at first glance, if you're looking for a couple of achievements (which are quite frustrating to get) and 3 trading cards, then go ahead, you might be satisfied with the purchase. But if you are looking for a nice little indie game for you to kill some time with, this game is certainly not what you're looking for (at least in its current state)			",244,44,5,25,22,2,23

												-This is barely a game. Very simple content. Music is public domain classical music. Sounds are quite limited. The gameplay is VERY repetitive.-This said, it doesn't cost a lot. There are no bugs, or close to none. It plays smoothly. The trailer, the screenshots are reliable. In a sense it's a work well done. Conclusion: You really get what you paid for. Almost nothing.

												Ok,I heard some reviews about this game saying that it was bad and things like that,and after playing it,even for a short time,as the game is indeed,a little short, I can say that the game is not bad,it's not the best thing there is out there,but the gameplay is fun,it reminds me to the Touhou series or Galaga and games like those.What I can say is that,paying the full price is not worth it,maybe if you find this game during a sale,and you have nothing else to buy,you can get this one,I got it for almost 10 cents or in my coin (which is the Mexican peso (1 dollar=almost 19 pesos)) 2 pesos.The game was really fun and really challenging,altough it's only 3 levels,but those levels are quite fun,you have some of your generic horror monsters,ghouls,gargoyles,wolves,bats,etc. But you also face the scariest enemies on the game....WALLS AND TREES.Yes,during most of the time,those two will be your real nightmare,but you can have fun either way,the 3 main bosses are 3 classic horror monsters,Count Orlox or Nosferatu (Here it's called The Phantom but it looks more like Nosferatu),The Headless Horseman and also Count Dracula.But the most impressive detail of the game is the BGM,the music is all made of classic epic music, like Toccata and Fugue in D Minor,or Dance Macabre and New World Symphony 4th Movement. The Music actually makes a big atmosphere for the game,and it made me enjoy the little time I had playing it,altough,I'm thinking of playing the survival mode,which is HARD MODE,but the game is really fun,you can spend some fun times but as I said,you can have more fun if you know that you bought the game during a sale.I give it an 8.7/10 It's bun,but you can get some frutrated some times and those walls and trees,man,I'm gonna have nightmares with those,but you can still enjoy it a lot.

												Hunting down Count Dracula in a creepy atmosphere, accompanied by fitting classical pieces such as Dvorak's New World Symphony and Grieg's Hall of the Mountain King. Sounds fun, but it's not.There's not story, the gameplay is lame and tedious. And it's unfair.After riding 5 minutes through the desolate wilderness of the last stage (the third!) you finally meet your foe, and after 10 seconds into the battle a wolf spawns right under your ♥♥♥ and you die because Dracula's attacks aren't avoidable. Congratulations, have fun riding 5 minutes through the wilderness again.I tried it twice just so I could say that I beat the 20 minutes game. But it's not worth it.			",633,216,23,81,65,7,90

A low cost shmup, that is mostly well done and has roguelike ambitions. This is not a deep game, or a must play by any means but the limited content that is there is well executed and the controls are smooth. And by satans knackers is that third boss challenging.Deffo one to add to your wishlist if your looking for a time filler. If you want something with more depth or ambition then look elswhere.

 Detail I'm going to be honest. This game should not be on Steam. Games like these are the reason why Steam Greenlight is being shut down.The controls are very basic. Move your paladin using the a, s, d, w or arrow keys and two attacks using either the left mouse button or spacebar. You must then guide your paladin through obstacles and evade enemies using either attacks or movements.Now, don't get me wrong, simple games like this one can be fun if implemented correctly. But this was not. The controls are very frustrating. With a game in which quick movements are so important, you simply must get the controls to work fluently. This flaw makes two of the three boss fights very frustrating. Verdict  The good  The classical music (public domain - nothing original here). The bad  Horrible controls. Frustrating boss fights. Repetitive with no originality. ",482,105,3,36,35,5,69

												This game gave me cancer, its that horrible. Its boring, a lame 2d sidescroller with no powerups, no UI, boring music, no sound effects, a ""campaign"" with no story or dialogue whatsoever. This is worse than most flash games on the web. Steam forces me to play it for 5 minutes before i can write a review, so i have to endure this garbage for a few more minutes, be right back........okay i lost 2 limbs and my will to live now too, thanks.

												The developers appear to have published a minigame and forgot to actually include the game itself.Would be ok after a total rewrite to actually put a game in there.			",1042,389,29,100,84,13,183

												Not even sure where to start.  The game is repetitive and uninteresting.  Gameplay gets super boring quite quickly.			",217,93,3,59,18,3,60

												This game takes some time to get used to. The music is great and the graphics are fine but the controls are hard... very hard.  As much as the game itself is too. At some stage it seems impossible to get further on in the campaign or the additional survival mode that has been included.If you buy the game on sale its worth spending a little bit of time on it though for the full price I would not recommend it because it gets very repetitive after a while.
