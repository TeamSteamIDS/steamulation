Early Access Review
								Since the recent physics update i felt the need to re-write my review.This is quite literally the best racing game ever conceived. I already held it in extremely high regard pre-0.8 and had taken plenty of time to master the game - And then boom. A complete overhaul of the aero, tyre and suspension models. Why? Because the community said the handling didn't feel quite right.They decided to then cram some equipment into a van and drive all the way to Barcelona from the UK to get some more feedback from the real world RX drivers, to help pinpoint where improvements could be made.If this doesn't show some real dedication to the early access model and prove that they're actively striving to make this the best rally game ever made, i really don't know what could change your mind.DiRT Rally v0.8 has managed to become my favourite all time game - Taking the throne from my childhood SNES classics and there's still more to come! I honestly can't find words to say how good the feeling of finding a perfect game and having a reliable stream of updates that just improve it further, really is.This deserves a perfect 10/10 and i'm sure by version 1.0 it will be damn close.

												+ No more Ken Block/X-Games/Gymkhana bull****.+ Early access done the right way.+ Lots of respect to rally history.+ Hard, unforgiving, enraging. Rally as rally must be.+ Gravel handling is a thrill.+ Much better force feedback if compared to previous Codemasters' titles.+ Great, varied car roster. Each car REALLY has its own behavior.+ Awesome feeling of reward, since learning is slow and gradual. You'll definitely learn the fundamentals of rallying.+ Truly 3-dimensional stages, faithful to the real ones.+ It's a ""sim"" and really asks for a wheel, but works great with an analog controller.– Stages get repetitive after some time (150-200 hours), since they are so few. Rally eventually turns into hotlapping.– Tarmac handling still doesn't feel totally right.– Issues with downforce. Cars are light and spend too much time on air. This is a serious problem that must be addressed in their next rally game.– The faster you go, more noticeable are the physics limitations. Especially at Finland, which sometimes seems to be another planet.– Damage system is OK but could be much better.Some serious cons, but still overwhelmed by the pros. The most fun racing game of the last decade. Addictive as crack.			",133,19,24,1,10,2,11

This is my Early Access review after putting some considerable hours into the game, playing various game modes while keeping a close eye on the community, the devs and updates.I would like to point out unequivocally to any existing DiRT fans: this is NOT DiRT 4, or anything close to what most everyone would consider a ""DiRT"" game/title. To be honest I'm not even sure why CM used the ""DiRT"" prefix at all, because there is literally no baring to that name except they are both rally games.There is no ""loudness"" or ""bro yeah"" in this game. No convoluted menu's that take 30 minutes to decipher. You are not forced to sit through tedious sound-bites of some jumped up prick telling you how to drive... I'm getting carried away. The point is this in not DiRT, this is something else!Many people have been calling for CodeMasters to go back to the glory days of rally games (MCrae) for years, and it seems they have not only listened at last, but delivered also. It's a sim, it's tough, and by gawd does it scare you to death!I should probably give some Pro's 'n' Con's at this point:PROS: It's a Rally Sim! Make a wrong move and your family will be placing flowers against a remote tree for years to come. As it should be, it is tough! Rally driving is the most demanding style of driving in the world, this is too. Plenty of cars, each with individual sounds, handling and tuning. They all feel different. The SOUND. No game has EVER come close to this. The sound in this game is mind blowing! From the individual engine sounds (you MUST hear them) to the gravel hitting your bodywork, to the perfect shifting, to the bad shifting... EVERYTHING. Menu's are sleek, to the point and very fast.CONS: Still favors wheels a LOT more over gamepads at present, although you can still compete with one (a gamepad) if determined. This has been addressed. Gamepads are now much more configurable! There is a long standing problem with nVidia MOBILE graphics cards in that you cannot go Fullscreen. Fixed. There is a bug that if you do not have a certain amount of GB free space (2-4GB) on your system drive, the game will fail to launch. TBH though everyone should have that at least!Even as Early Access this is still one of, if not the best racing game i've ever played and I have stated many times that ""racing games are too easy, therefore i dislike them"". With this game I have been well and truely slapped around the face!.If you like sims I recommend, if you like rally racing I recommend, if you like a genuine challenge I recommend.If you like easy wins, easy AI, easy life and easy achievements - you lookin' at the wrong game.This is for the determined, for the persistent, for the fighter, for those that ""quitting"" is a cuss word.To those people i rate it: Highly RecommendedEDIT (Dec 2015): With many additions in terms of tracks and vehicles, FFB improvements, gamepad improvements, UI improvements and much more, I stand by my initial conclusion - this is one of, if not the best rally game ever made.

												It's the DiRT game we've all been waiting forLet's get the most important detail out of the way immediately.THIS GAME HAS GROUP BYES. IT HAS THE AUDI QUATTRO.NO THERE IS NO GYMKHANA AND KEN BLOCK IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUNDThat alone is reason enough to buy it.But there's more. Stages are much longer, 4-10 minutes.Car tuning is much more in depth. Varied weather of just about every condition. Difficult tracks. Great sounding cars. Great graphics. The only thing that could be improved is the damage modeling, which is very forgiving even on the hardest difficulty in certain situations. I've never rolled the car and not been able to drive off.This is one early access game you should buy in to right away. We've been starving for a proper rally game for years. This is the best there has been since RBR.UPDATE 3/5/2016The game is out, and it's fantastic. This is quite simply as good as rally games get.			",178,21,10,24,12,0,38

												Early Access done right like a driver getting through the sharpest turn by doing a scandinavian flick. Codemasters were good drivers, listening to the co-pilots who gave feedback during development.Apart from that, the most authentic rally game since Colin McRae Rally and Richard Burns Rally. It can please both casuals driving 60's cars in Monte Carlo with assists enabled, and hardcore drivers going through Pikes Peak at high speed from start to finish.What other reviewers say is damn right. Best and most challenging rally game in years, realistic driving (even though physics might not be the best), great immersion, technically beautiful in almost every way and many classic and modern cars to drive. Career mode is simple, yet effective which encourages you to drive each car and upgrade them overtime, then there's player-versus-player Rallycross and online leaderboard rally and hillclimb to prove your worth.I won't recommend playing online (unless you join leagues) other than to earn credits though. It's full of hotlappers with 1000+ hrs of playtime who know every inch of all stages.Totally recommended, if you don't cut.			",366,44,32,18,32,5,30

Encouragement EditionSo far I've put 31 hours into DiRT Rally, which is nothing really, since it took me roughly 30 hours to be able to drive confidently. Now that it's out of Early Access and despite glowing reviews from that period, I want to offer words of encouragement to those who have no experience with rally simulation games. My experience with rally sims is literally that, 31 hours. For a long time I thought my big brother was kinda crazy with his Richard Burn Rally, GT Legends and what have you. I stayed away from his racing sims, cos I knew I wouldn't be able to compete with his stage times. So instead we got competitive in games like NFS: High Stakes (the Snowy Ridge stage in particular) and the old Colin McRae Rally games, which had enough arcade handling for me to be able to compete with him. Naturally he played with assists off, where available. I on the other hand wouldn't even know how to begin to setup my car, let alone understand how turning off certain assists would translate into the handling of the car. And I pretty much still don't. For someone my age, I've driven very little in real life, but my mechanically inclined big brother knew exactly what he was doing back then. So most of the time he was kicking my ♥♥♥, both in and out of the games. I keed, I keed.My immediate conclusion after the first few hours with DiRT Rally was that I had no clue how to drive. A drunk elephant skating on ice would have more finesse. While I didn't rage-quit as often as I was expecting to, at the start I was playing only in third person view, thinking that my experience with the NFS, GTA or Colin McRae Rally games would help me here. It didn't. What I soon realized was that an outside view of my driving made me too aware of the track, which is probably just me, but that coupled with racing sim handling spelled disaster for me. So either by brazen choice or through cunning design, I chose the cockpit view to complete an entire stage, which I had never done in any racing game before. Sure, I've toggled it on and off here and there, but I had never stuck with it until now. This had an interesting effect on my driving, cos I was assessing the track and my line of driving more by feel than by actually seeing the track from above. I mean besides listening to your co-driver, which is important if you want to win. All that said, I think it's a good idea to put some 30 hours into it before you drift off to other games, cos being an FPS guy mostly and after taking long breaks from it, I was essentially starting afresh every time I returned. Even if your skills are still there, the stage conditions from Wales to Greece will bring you back to earth in no time.Recently I graduated to Clubman, which means you'll do 6 stages per race and have 2 opportunities to repair your car. While my initial reaction was ""oh no, I want to do more races with 4 stages before I move on,"" which I assume you still can in custom races, but once you've qualified there's no reason to go back. You've earned your place here. It doesn't matter if you finished 3rd, 2nd or first, or think you got lucky. While there's always an element of luck in any game, DiRT Rally will never meet you halfway, it will never hold your hand and even though a beginner like myself will have assists on for the foreseeable future, the game will teach you what you need in order to progress. Practice will take you where you want to go.DiRT Rally is an elegant product, the menus are simple and the soundtrack is smooth, as you get ready for the next stage/race or manage your team. I imagine the Early Access feedback had a lot to do with making it as enjoyable as possible, both on and off the track. This being my first racing game with achievements, the 170 achievements it now has is an additional motivator to get better at it. I'm really glad they included them and that they keep adding them with updates. If I were to offer feedback of my own, I hope to see an Estonian flag among the spectators someday. I also want to congratulate Codemasters in getting it right and returning to their roots. I've missed you immensely.			",207,30,4,5,7,0,3

								Right now this game is raw rallying, I truly hope that Paul Coleman and the brilliant team at Codemasters has an ""If it ain't broke don't fix it"" attitude towards developing this superb masterpiece further.There aren't many games that ooze this kind of passion. The attention to detail is breathtaking, from the modelling of each and every car to the super realistic real world tracks and the mesmerizing sounds of each unique engine rumble and crackling backfire. So much has been achieved by this team already and I look forward to seeing how they keep on improving as the months fly by. If you love rallying this is a must and a steal at £25. I would happily pay twice that much for a game of this magnitude and content.When you spend 4-5 hour sessions everyday just using an almost fully upgraded Peugeot 205 T16 Evo 2 with no assists and locked to dashcam on a Welsh stage like Bidno Moorland reverse, crashing over and over trying to push the limit and better your fastest stage time, you cant help but spend 59 precious seconds thumb downing all 59 negative reviews.Congratulations Codies, you have made so many of us so happy, your passion for this game really shines through keep up the good work.

								When Colin McRae Rally was released at the end of the previous century, that was some kind of revolution: For the first time, there was a simulation that really felt like driving a car! Now, some 17 years later, there is another rally simulation. And it feels like driving a car. For real! They say they made a physical simulation of individual car components. In combination forming the experience of driving rally cars from the 1960s to today's WRC. And what can I say - an overwhelming success! I mean, I'm sitting here with my keyboard, right? I don't even own a frigging steering wheel. But I do own a car. And I sure know what driving that feels like. And I know that this game feels like that more than anything else I've ever seen on a video screen. Recommended without the slightest hesitation to anybody interested in simulation games and racing simulations in particular. Don't miss out! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You like vroom cars? That's great. You like realistic cars flying over bad roads that will punish you for your mistakes...but won't kill you for them like an actual car would? DiRT Rally is a solid sim, with its only real problem being a limited track selection.Two things first. This game requires a DirectX 11-capable GPU, and there is an achievement for having played the game in Early Access. I don't know if it'll prevent 100% completion, but it is a thing.Apart from that, this is 100% recommended for rally fans, and anybody who isn't afraid of a challenge. DiRT Rally is the fundamental opposite of DiRT Showdown, and it shows. Excellent physics (Codemasters' most realistic to date), truly awesome sound, breath-taking graphics, oodles of cars and a great variety of locations already. Between the career, multiplayer (with leagues!), fully customizable modes, achievements, and aforementioned car/track variety, there is a lot of value here.Rally is predicated less on being the best right from the start and more around improving yourself as you go, gradually pushing yourself forward. Which is good, because this game really does simulate rally, and it is unforgiving. New players, trust me when I say you will screw up and it will probably be frustrating - because I sure feel it! And that's okay, because improving yourself in this game is truly rewarding, and driving itself is more often than not its own reward. Hell, veteran drivers aren't always perfect either. This game is quite possibly the most elegant combination of game and simulator I've ever seen.The community will probably tell you to turn off all the driving aids from the start, but they're there for a reason. One must learn to walk before they can run, so I would suggest incrementally turning them off whenever you feel comfortable enough to. Or...not. How you use this game's remarkably wide-ranging realism/aid preferences are up to you.If there's any criticism to be had of this game, it's that playing with a keyboard leaves you at so much of a disadvantage you need a controller or wheel to really get the most out of your vehicle, and you will need to push your vehicle that far eventually. That's not really a problem if you're a simulationist with a wheel or even a spare conroller, though. The real main problem is that there's also only six locations in total for rally, one for hillclimb and three for rallycross - if you play this game enough they'll eventually become familiar, which isn't entirely a good thing for rally racing.The career progression is also rather impersonal: you mainly interact with the championships via sterile menus. I would have liked to see my car in the service area so I can look at its damage in detail. Showcases for the cars, complete with short videos and historical information for people deciding which car to buy, would also have been neat.Don't get me wrong, it's still good and functional and all, but ideally there'd be something more like what's described in this special-interest review[www.worldrallyblog.com] I found.I'll leave you with a few basic pointers:* Real world rally knowledge carries over to this game, if you know any. If you don't, you should probably keep reading.* Slower is often faster! It's better to downshift to drift around a corner than slam on the brakes to avoid crashing your car.* On that note, rally is as much about finesse as it is about having a lead foot - in other words attempting to maintain a level of control. Learn to use momentum to your advantage around corners.* Throttle control is important, but it's much more important with RWD cars. If you step on it all the time, you're going to spin out all the time.* You're going to need a certain level of concentration to absorb your co-driver's course notes and keep the car on the road. The course notes are what let rally drivers really push themselves forward with confidence.* The helmet camera, for what it's worth, helps me drive better sometimes. Either way, it's awesome.* If all else fails, you should probably slow down.* If that fails, blame the mechanic.			",195,39,3,14,32,1,35

Early Access Review
								So out of what seems like out of no where a ""Realistic"" rally game appears from the same Codemasters that couldn't really satisfy my Rally needs since Colin McRae Era, dubious I was to say the least..How very WRONG I was, for the fans of the old Colin McRae games this is the simulation you were waiting for (you know they are taking realism seriously when they even give you the option to manually control your launch and even penalise you if you muck it up) so back are the repair times service area management mechanics, back are the narrow tracks, back are the stages that last longer than 2 minutes and for goodness sake back are the realistic physics!.. Seriously playing this with no HUD, all assists off, and just your co-driver instructions for guidance (who you actually need to listen to now where I felt you could ignore in Dirt 3 with its tracks wider than they are long) It just feels so right and so immersive I'd love to try it with Rift.Even driving the starting Mini I feel there's so much room for improvement in my own game to cut down on my times which is going to take so much much hours of practice to perfect. It's not often I have felt out of depth with realism (even after playing Assetto Corsa, Race series, GT5 etc).. and I LOVE it! I ain't even mad I finished 4th after completing my first rally, I was a minute off pace overall (2 track recoveries, an early start penalty and several restarts due to me missing the co-driver's instructions causing me to brake heavy, lock up the wheels and head straight into a tree or three).. Had this have been Dirt 3 I would have restarted until I nailed the perfect run as the stages were so short you didn't really need commit yourself to each run but I felt like I drove as best I could to my current ability, there's not milliseconds between the race positions but usually 10's of seconds and could even be a minute which I like very much and find a refreshing take and really shows the skill involved in consistent driving over many long stages, every crash or scrape can become crucial as the stages progress as you may not have time to fix the damage between stages hindering your cars performance in the long run. It's definitely difficult to finish first but I don't feel cheated as I could see myself where I was losing time this only inspires me to play more and get better, challenge IS what I'm looking for in my sims.There's already a decent selection of cars spanning all era's and some tracks that feel right at home for rally nerds. I can't wait to see what the future brings for this sim, any sim enthusiasts that are on the fence I beg you to at least try this game for a very reasonable price and support this it may give you a reason to let RBR have a rest for a while.Some improvements I would like to see is more debris, loose gravel, mud, anything to make the track surface not look so perfectly smooth, and the spectators are very low poly models, but can't fault the majority of visuals.Mod support to keep this game fresh after the DLC cycles have expired (track generator/community tracks would be suffice also)Although basic Multiplayer in the form of Online Leaderboards/Leagues are already implemented I do hope Real Time Multiplayer is planned even if it's just in the same form as CM with simultaneous/staggered timed runs against friends.Final Note - This does not play like your ""usual"" early access game, the actual gameplay is as polished you would expect from a full release candidate I have experienced a few hard lockups on the menu and the BGM can get repititve quick, but overall had it not been for the lack of additional content which is yet to come (cars, tracks,modes) you wouldn't even consider this early access compared to a lot of other steam titles on gameplay alone.HardwareLogitech F510 Controller (no configuring necessary), will try out the old G27 when it gets closer to release (other reviews have stated FFB isn't yet upto standard).GTX 980 - Game runs silky smooth 100+ fps on Ultra, good optimization and good to be on the forefront of development rather than getting a lazy port.TL:DR Not for the faint hearted, as a sim.. This delivered what I was hoping for!			",182,10,15,6,25,0,18

												No Ken Block, no drift events, no annoying announcers, just one hard a$$ rally racing sim.  The best off-road racing game available.  Tracks are beautiful and challenging with many different road surfaces.  The cars all feel unique and are INSANELY modifiable.  I'm talking like spring damper, and sway bar adjusting.  Gear ratios, brake bias.  Everything.  This game makes me want to get a high end racing wheel.Edit:  This game made me go out and get a high end racing wheel, and OMG totally worth it.

								This game is unforgiving, harsh, and deadly, however its incredibly addictive. Every failure and crash makes you want to race again,and again. To me its like like a racing game on difficulty insane which makes me want to master it even more. I feel I have to mentally prepare myself in between courses because I just cant keep up with the speeding and cornering aspects in locations such as finland which have fast and easy bends but one wrong move, and too much power on the throttle could send your car up a tree or through the undergrowth. This is the racing game Ive been looking for, for a long time. Think Dark souls but on four wheels.			",191,13,7,26,23,1,19

9.5/10""OMFG, Colin McRae Rally is finally back!""First Impression OMFG is this real?! Yes it is!!! It's awesome to finally be able to play a true rally game after all these years. The controls are definitely far away from the arcade-ish one of Dirt 1,2,3. The length of the tracks is great - and not as short as the ones in the old DIRTs. And the tracks have a whole lot more than just ""4"" different curve types - as you might remember it from WRC 4. Dirt Rally is definitely the best rally racing game out there, and after a fast EarlyAccess phase it's already finished!Pros:+ great grameplay+ great controls/handling+ great car physcis+ very good graphics+ great sound+ great rally-tracks+ great co-pilot+ great difficulty+ no ""rewinds""+ best time on tracks ""friend-highscore""+ devs kept their word!+ driving wheel & controller supportCons:- none- ""Wish"": I'd love to see more countries/tracksDIRT Rally is simply the best rally sim out there.

Early Access Review
								WOW!  I never thought i'd see the day that Codies produced any driving game with such authenticity, let alone a spiritual successor to RBR.  I'm amazed and somewhat shocked how good Dirt Rally is.Took a while to get the settings dialed in to my liking and it still needs work on the FFB (base lateral and centering forces) .   Also the damage model could do with a bit of refinement, but otherwise very, very good indeed.Please Codies, don't be tempted to dumb this down or add a whole load of peripheral fluff before release.  Keep it pure and focussed on the essence of the sport.  Continue in the same vein and you'll make a lot of serious racers very happy.If Ken Block appears even once and calls me 'dude' I'm gonna hurt someone.			",49,22,10,9,9,0,2

								This is what us sim racing rally fans have been waiting for ages! The DiRT series has made a full 180 hairpin turn from the stylized arcade mayhem, straigh for the crown of rally sims, a genre that has had no interesting releases for quite some time. It's hard, it's scary, it's messy, it's rally.DiRT Rally is not perfect though. It could have a deeper career mode, there could be a more varied multiplayer experience, the cars could (or should) take more damage on hard impacts, the pacenotes could have better pacing and the replay system is just plain bad at the moment. That being said, the weird panic induced zenlike mode I get in to every single time at the beginning of a stage, when the countdown reaches zero, is something beyond words. Shaving off the seconds from your time at the edge of control while navigating the icy narrow mountain roads or dodging trees and rocks in a dark forrest is a real treat. The sim is still on early access though, and I can't wait for the improvements we're going to see in the future. Early access or not, there's still a lot of good to be said here. The graphics, sounds, handling, car selection, stages and the mood in general are all top notch.Can you tell that I'm excited? Because I am. And I can't stop racing. If you are a sim racer craving for a rally experience, this might be something worth checking out right now.I just hope that Codemasters Racing Studio respects the sim racing community enough and doesn't mock up the final product, turning it in to another DiRT 3 due to public pressure.TL;DR - I love it!

												So it's finally out.. It's been one wild ride since april when the game was suddenly released. I still remamber I was aching for a proper rallygame back then. And suddenly DiRT rally popped out. I think this next sentence describes my feelings about the game well. ""I bought my 9000kr pc just so I could play this game."" And I have not regretted a moment since. While the game still has some minor flaws like a bare bones career mode and missing a few cars I would like. The whole pacage is so good that the flaws become almost irrelevant. I reccomend everybody with an interst in racing games to give this a try. And DiRT Rally is my game of the year.

								Nostalgia is a funny old thing. It preserves the good memories of games past, whilst erasing the bad. It makes you forget all the little things you hated about a game, and convinces you the thing you loved was perfect. What has this got to do with DiRT Rally, I hear you ask. Well, its about expectation, and the ghost of the original Colin McRae Rally. I spent many, many hours hooked up to my PlayStation playing that game. I perfected every line, honed every set up. If I close my eyes now, I can still conjure up images of New Zealand's stages. Colin McRae Rally is indelibly marked upon my brain, and ever since then I searched for a rally game with the same feeling.I've enjoyed the Dirt games over the years, but I think its fair to say the game had drifted a fair way from it's roots. Yes, they were fun, but they never really recaptured that sense of tearing through a stage, whilst being one mistake away from total disaster. Easier handling and a flashback button removed the sense of jeopardy, and with it came the removal of that epic sense of beating the terrain. The endless effort to make the game more accesible watered down the sense of excitement. No longer were you flying by the seat of your pants. Going off-line, and hitting a tree was a mistake you could fix. In short, it no longer felt like that rally game I first played all those years ago.DiRT Rally does away with the safety blanket. And whilst that may render the game less accesible to a wider audience, it does mean that the feeling is back. Every time-gain will have to be earned. Every mistake will cost you dear. Success behind the wheel will require skill, and a knowledge of how a car behaves on the various different surfaces. Listening to the pace notes is essential, as is knowing when to push, and when to not. Forget about what came before, and put on your big-boy trousers, 'cause Dirt Rally takes no prisoners.I could praise this game for many reasons, but I'll leave it at this; from the very first moment I played DiRT Rally, I felt like the series was back where it belonged. I felt like I was sitting in my bedroom again, playing the game I loved so long ago.Finally, Colin McRae Rally has a worthy successor. F*** yeah!			",12,1,1,7,1,2,9

Early Access Review
								DiRT Rally is a rally racing simulation game from the well known Codemasters which is currently available through Steam Early Access. In DiRT Rally you get behind the wheel of some of the best rally cars from the past few decades ranging from the 1960 Mini Cooper to the Ford Fiesta all on tight tracks winding in and out of mountains, going through ice patches and taking you around precarious hairpins. You may be put off by the name DiRT when talking about a sim but Rally is not like the previous DiRT games, Codemasters have removed arcade features such as flashback and have made it a far more serious game, helping it to become what is already a fantastic racing sim.Before I get into the main part of my review I just want to point out that I have no previous experience with Rally games and I played DiRT Rally with a 360 controller, not a wheel.+Fantastic graphics, even when you're not playing on Ultra it still looks great+Great driving physics, I'm no expert on the physics behind rally racing but they feel pretty realistic to me+DiRT Rally really captures the pressure of rally racing as you constantly have to battle with your car so it doesn't go off the edge of a cliff, or maybe it's just because I suck at racing games+Already 36 different stages across 3 locations to try out (with more to be added)+Weather conditions and time of days can be customised completely when creating a custom event+14 high quality cars across 6 classes which are currently available (with more to be added)+Good damage models+All of the cars have different liveries for you to choose from and use+Excellent co-driver who is very helpful once you actually understand what he's saying+Very challenging+You can hire engineers to work for you who will upgrade your car and work on it between stages+In-depth tuning system though it's only for people who really know what they're doing+You can create custom events where all cars are available as well as compete in the championship mode+Simplistic menu and UI+Multiple camera angles from both in and outside the car+Great soundeffects-No form of tutorial whatsoever, not even any text descriptions. As someone who has no experience with rally this made getting into the game incredibly difficult as I had no idea what my co-driver was saying-Nothing major but the windshield wipers are automatic and can be rather distracting when they suddenly turn on even when your windshield isn't wet-Seeing as I don't have a wheel I haven't experienced this myself but from what I understand from other reviewers the force feedback in the game isn't good at allVerdict:9DiRT Rally is already a fantastic, challenging racing sim with fantastic graphics, great physics, a fair few cars and stages and great soundeffects.***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***El K.

If COdemasters releases all their games the way this Rally has been released with feedback AND implementation i will empty my wallet for them.

												DiRT Rally is not for the faint of heart. Previous enjoyment of the series is not indicative to how much satisfaction you'll find here. Closer to a simulation than an arcade experience and precise in nature, it could be a tough sell for some DiRT fans. If you enjoy Rally driving, then all you need is patience and unwavering concentration. Difficult tracks, cars that are hard to master and an emphasis on endurance are all part of the reason why DiRT Rally is a great entry in the franchise. Drivers will be pushed to their limits both physically and mentally. It includes a decent number of Rally tracks in different settings that require many hours to master. Same can be said for the vehicles, which handle superbly. Unfortunately the supporting content is fairly shallow, with the Hillclimb and Rallycross modes struggling to justify their inclusion. There is no online rally competition either, with Rallycross being a poor and flawed substitute. Pay no mind though, because as the name implies this game lives and breathes Rally driving. It builds immense satisfaction as you make corners with precision and promotes consistency as you finish events without a scratch. DiRT Rally is hard work, and there is nothing wrong with that.Read full review[www.newgamenetwork.com] ",264,47,14,13,8,0,17

								Just like every codies game I decided to pick this one up with my Xbox360 controller, and i am pleasantly surprised at how difficult it is. Where previous titles were pretty much arcade, this is a whole lot more towards sim. It really takes some getting used to. Braking in the middle of a turn is a real no-go, just like how it would be in real life. Because braking in turns is a no-go you really have to be a whole lot more cautious going into turns, making the whole game a whole lot more difficult and more fun. you can't magically turn back time anymore, so when you've flipped your car you really flipped it, there is no turning back.This challenge makes the game much more real, the challenges of rallying are very much present, take caution going in and out of turns and listen good to your co-driver.The game runs exceptionally well(just like every other codies game). I'm not sure if this game runs on the new version of the Ego-engine.The two stages I have played were around 4mins long, which is okay. The stages feel much tighter, and there is a real danger in going slightly off track as rocks, dips and bumps are very much present. Based on my two runs stage design seems to be a whole lot better than previous DiRT games(and maybe even the original).Overall, I'd say it is a very worthy successor of the original DiRT, maybe even better. As it's early access I'm certain a whole lot more will be coming up(for example Hillclimb is present as ""coming soon""), so watch this title.Based on my half-hour of gameplay I'd say it's definitely worth it's money(it's priced lower than a full triple-A release)			",190,28,46,22,66,3,30

								There’s nothing like flying down a dirt road sliding around corners and missing edges by inches. Its seat of the pants driving in the extreme.Rally-sport is one of the last untamed racing types in existence. To me its baffling why the sport is not more popular. Im looking forward to attending my first local one next spring. A number of years ago after dirt showdown came out I was so disappointed by the offering I did a google search for rumors about the next dirt game when I came across a extensive survey(8 pages long) for what I wanted in the next dirt game. The nature of the questions were thorough and specific as far as authenticity and most of all realistic simulation vs arcade racing. After taking the survey I was super existed told fellow racing friends about it. But years went by and nothing... 9months ago codies said they were removing the dreaded GFWL from dirt 3 and making it a steamworks game. Time went by and I thought its fate was the same as the survey I took. Then in time for my birthday for this year we got Dirt 3 Complete. Then I was blown away because not long after dirt 3 came this gem.Much longer tracks that have way more bends and curves with a track width barely wide enough to get the car past. If you play this like dirt3 you will not get far. There is no green line assist showing you where to go. Instead you have cards that pop up before you telling you the about the corner ahead and an audio prompt from your co-driver. I play with no HUD on and listen to my co-drivers calls. It takes along time to learn the stages but its super rewarding when you do.If you are looking for a casual but fun experience I highly recommend dirt3. If you don’t have a Dx input device like a wheel or game pad I would recommend you hold off buying this as I imagine it would be quite frustrating.If you have played dirt 3 or  other rally games and you want a challenge I whole hardheartedly recommend this title. Even though its early access , it comes out in mostly complete slices. The communication with the community has been excellent going as far as doing a little hour long twitch show to show off the new content and Q&A. They have listened to the community and delivered changes  that were within their ability. If your a wheel user like me you will appreciate that was one of their first big fixes was to rip out the cheesy 270 deg wheel setting and give us proper 900 deg. Track Ir support from previous titles is still present and the drivers view positions are really good even if you cant adjust it.  they set the bar when it comes to communication and feedback for early acess.I see reviews saying the graphics are bad looking dull and muddy, frankly these people don’t know what they are talking about. A lot of modern games use filters and fx to make things look super high fidelity and detailed. You wold never see the world this way when bombing down a dirt road at 45mph. And when the weather effects kick in its quite realistic. I’m able to run this on ultra with my R9280x the only time I get sub 60fps is if I run screen cap and steam streaming simultaneously.If you are a wheel using motor sport enthusiast I highly recommend this.

								This is the Dark Souls of racing games. Every second of a stage is a struggle of staying in control and pushing the envelope to save fractions of a second on a corner.

												It's a great game, all rally lovers should buy it! Atmosphere is excellent, graphics and sound effects are perfect. Stages are very detailed and fun. Driving is challenging but not disturbing at all. DIRT Rally would be the best choice to feel the rally spirit! Number of cars are enough and there are heart-warming cars in game. Maybe number of rallies would be more but there are great number of detailed stages in all six rallies and there are extras; hillclimb and rallycross.			",1,0,6,0,0,0,0

												When i was a small boy i saw a WRC race on the TV, and after that i was hooked. The way these professional rally drivers took corners effortlessly, flew over jumps as if they actually had wings and how the miraculously came out of ever spectacular tumble un-harmed. So being the naive little boy i was i went out and bought DiRT 1, and it was the best game i ever owned, and soon after that DiRT 2 came along and blew me away with its imersive campaign mode and vast amount of cars. When i grew older and entered my teens I was looking for a more challenging game than DiRT 1 or 2; as i have mastered them completely. I remember the day i bought Dirt 3, another adventure in a box just waiting for my teenage hands to learn the mystery of GYMKHANA. So you could imagine my excitement stumbling upon a page witin the DiRT Reddit annoucing the new game ""DiRT Rally"". I had the amazing chance to help the DiRT community to create the new version of my favorite game , a real dream come true. Long story short DiRT Rally won't be just a game to me, it's an experience which i helped to create. I had high expectations for this game, and all those expectations were met, and more 10/10			",14,3,6,5,2,0,3

								Incredible rally sim. This goes back to the days of the original DiRT, with hardcore, white-knuckle rally action, but with absolutely stunning visuals and attention to detail. The physics in this game are unreal; track surface is an actual, breathing thing; damage is amazingly accurate with every piece of the vehicle taking both external and internal damage (and requires repairs in-between event stages); and things you wouldn't even think of are all taken into consideration (for example: the engine putting out less BHP because of the thinner atmosphere in the high-altitude Pike's Peak as you Hill Climb it in real-time.. O.o ).If you're looking for a no-nonsense, hardcore racing sim, nothing beats this game. Worth every damn Early Access penny.			",61,3,2,2,2,0,2

												DiRT Rally, despite its minor flaws, is so finely tuned that I cannot recommend it enough. There is a fairly steep learning curve, especially if you will be using a controller of your choosing. But trust me, it is worth it. I use a PS4 controller and it is absolutely satisfying when I pull off Scandinavian flicks. If you happen to be Deaf (such as myself) you can select the option to have icons, inidicating what your co-driver is telling you, show up during a rally race. You might have to do a bit of research to figure out what the numbers and arrows mean, but for the most part it is common sense. Plus there is a tutorial video on it--but overall still a bit tough to get used to. Last but not least, this game is visually pleasing and has neat detailing within the environments by how the road reacts to the vehicle and vice versa. It is worth every hard earned penny whether it is on sale or not.Just ♥♥♥♥ing buy it already.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dirt Rally is by far my favourite racing game. I need to make it clear that I'm not a car guy, and certainly not generally a 'sim' person. Rally is probably the most hardcore sim I've played. What's nice (and I know a lot of racing games do this) is that you're in control of how difficult you'd like the experience to be to some extent. Locking your perspective to first-person only, disabling assists like ABS brakes and UI hints will certainly make the game harder, and in turn earns you a reward multiplier. I wasn't expecting to enjoy making it as realistic as I could, but it's incredibly fun.For the most part you're racing against yourself. It's Rally; It's your time that's on the line. No matter how many times I've played the same track, I need to listen to the calls for what lies ahead. Sometimes I find myself daydreaming and just bombing down the track, inevitably soaring off a cliff or straight into a tree because I got too deep in thought. But I know it's my own fault. It wasn't a bad AI opponent or bad controls, everything that happens is because of how in tune I am with the car on a moment to moment basis.The reason I've put so many hours into this game is the daily, weekly and monthly challenges. When I know I can only put 20 minutes or so into a game for an evening, I launch Rally and do the two daily challenges. A few extra moments? Do a few tracks in the weekly or monthly challenges. You're given feedback at the end of each track as to how you've ranked against everyone else competing in the same event. It's one of the few games where you can noticeably and immediately see improvements in your own performance which is remarkably satisfying. It can also be frustrating to be pushing yourself during an event to beat other player's times, only to cut a corner when expressly told ""DON'T CUT"" and find yourself slammed into a rock wall. This risk/reward nature is what makes Rally so exciting.This game can be really tough at the beginning, especially when compared to more arcade-focused racing games. Once you get a grasp on the physics and a good sense of a car's weight, there is no better feeling than nailing a hard curve or corner that has given you trouble in the past. As I said, I'm definitely not a car guy, and yet I find myself tweaking my saved vehicle set ups, trying to conquer turns and shave seconds off my times on tracks I've played hundreds of times. That's not something I was personally expecting from a racing game, and it's why I will continue to play Dirt Rally for the foreseeable future. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The stages of my personal evolution as a virtual rally driver: ""The 'Dark Souls' of racing sims? Laughable! I'm a good driver in real life - at least far better than those other 95% of morons moving their cars on the streets - and I already have some hours in other racing sims. So can't be that tough, eh?"" Bought DiRT Rally, plugged in my wheel, created a custom event in Wales, ""Uh, Group B cars. Nice!"", picked the Lancia Delta S4, 5-4-3-2-1 ... full throttle ... went off the track in the 1st corner... ""For real??? Ok, bad luck. Next try!"" On my 5th try I eventually managed the 1st corner but flew off into the forest due to a bump right before the 2nd corner. Unlocked the ""Mondays Be Like..."" achievement. ""Ok, haha, a 480 - 650hp car on gravel may indeed be a little bit overambitious to begin with."" Selected a 2010' 300hp Ford Fiesta, same stage in Wales. Flew off in the first corner again... About half an hour and several attempts later: ""The game is still early access. I'm sure there are some bugs left in the physics engine..."" Google didn't bring up a single hit. Stumbled upon this vid while googling for known bugs. Got severely depressed. Didn't touch DiRT Rally for a month. Accidentally found some basic tutorials. First recommendation: Start with a 1960 car! ""Drive a >50 year old 100hp Mini Cooper? Me? Yeah... Sure!"" Went on reading the tutorials anyhow. ""Weight transfer... Left foot breaking ... Effectively reducing speed by using the side walls of the tyres ... Scandinavian flick ..."" ""Wow! I had no idea..."" Started the career with the 1960' Mini Cooper... Finished my very first stage with 3 crashes, 1 flat tyre and more than 3 mins behind.  About 80h in the game now I'm back to the Group B and 2010' cars. If I have a really good day and if I manage to stay focused (processing the visual input from the road directly ahead of me and working the pedals & wheel to keep control over that beast of a car while simultaneously listening to my co-driver and mentally preparing for the 2 upcoming corners based on his pacenotes) and with a little bit of luck I may be able to finish a masters event without restart, but then somewhere around 4th to 8th place. With some restarts I may be able to win an event. Being able to finish an event among the top 3 without restarts? Still a long way to go... ;-) Finally, have I become a better driver in real life? No, I don't think so. But I gained an aweful lot more respect for professional racing drivers and especially rally drivers. Watching motorsports with completely different eyes now. Well, and sometimes I discover myself coursing a bit less about those other 95% of real world drivers... ;-)11/10 for a game which can be so frustrating yet rewarding at the same time. Words can't tell the feeling of a clean stage win after hours of practice. If you enjoy racing sims and if you think you are a good driver, this game may attack your ego from time to time, but it keeps you practicing, learning and improving. At the end of the day it is so much fun!			",46,7,6,1,9,0,9

												If you're still on the fence about making this purchase jump off and pull that purchase trigger. Please, try your best not to hold the recent Grid releases against the Codie's. To me it seems they learned an invaluable lesson from those two racers, and they're most definitely back on the correct course to listening to their player base. The early access, albeit long, was instrumental in making this game what we've come to expect from Codemasters.  I highly doubt you will be dissapointed in purchasing this gem! While a wheel will definitely make the experience more enjoyable, because the use of a clutch and the ability to hold specific gears does make a difference in Rally Racing. This is still a game, and sure you can setup manual gear usage with a controller but it actually takes away from your time, in my opinion. However, I've played with a wheel and controller. I found the game to still be highly enjoyable regardless of either method, yet I do not recommend using the keyboard, hehe. While it's not a full on simulation type experience this isn't a keyboard friendly game unless you could care less about trying to beat your friend's times and, or attempts to beat your previous best times.While not the best review (I'll leave that to the pro's) I hope this gives someone assistance as to whether or not this game is worth your hard earned dollars. I generally wait for a 50% plus off sale of many AAA games nowadays, but this is certainly not one of them!Addendum: I should have written this 'review' after playing the release version, instead of going by the early access game, because the release version 1.0 is definitely a different beast. Anyhow, my thoughts have not changed overall. Yet, there are significant changes that I won't get into  as ""TL:DR"" as is... but I definitely take back the controller thoughts concerning the gearbox. The 'quick clutch' feature is most impressive for controller users under an automatic gearbox! 'Nuff said, hehe.			",711,197,54,75,84,6,144

								At long last, Rally has returned. No more Ken Block and his Benihana! Challenging, narrow and unforgiving tracks is what awaits you here, just what you'd expect from a Rally game. Though this does seem to take it one step farther in upping the difficulty, the terrain jerks the weel and you can feel the weight and power of the cars.+ Realistic handling.+ Proper car setup (dampening, suspension, break bias etc)+ The Co-Driver sounds better than he ever has, alot less like a robot. He even sounds like he's riding a car on rough and bumpy terrain.+ The overall audio is stellar, from engine sounds to stones hitting your car as you go barreling down gravel roads.+ Cockpit view with adjustable FoV- The graphics, while serviceable do look really dull, what is it with devs and their love of washed out colorless nature?This is without a doubt the most polished early access game I've ever seen, I left out the obvious lack of content cause y'know, early access. And I'm sure the minor stuff will be cleaned up soon enough.While it may not have mass appeal like its predecessors, its target audience will be more than pleased.This is pure Rally joy, it's what you've been waiting for if you have even a remote interest in the sport. And it's about time to.			",157,9,10,31,12,0,4

								I'm not really a motorsport guy but I've played nearly every Codemasters rally game since Colin McRae rally hit the scene. I feel strongly that Codemasters has been heading downhill. Every game in the DiRT series got just that little bit more childishly arcade, hip, Ken Block, etc, than the previous title.DiRT Rally changed that. DiRT Rally is an actual rally game where you do actual rallying. This is a game where hipsters have been banned and Ken Block is relegated to doing donuts in Asda carpark like the chav he is. This is a real game for real men (and women, boys & girls), this is rallye.			",150,23,21,5,41,1,24

												I've been playing racing sims since the first GTR, and I had spent a really good time honing my skills. But not even all the kilometers I ever ""driven"" on the computer were enough for what expected me here.People aren't kidding when they compare this game to the Dark Souls franchise. It's totally merciless: Screw up the timing for a single corner and BAM!, there goes your time and two or three positions on the standings. For plebs like me who doesn't find themselves in the posession of a computer steering wheel and play on gamepad controllers (X360 gamepad here), nailing a stage is comparable to brain surgery. On the other side, finish a stage perfectly and you'll feel like Tommi Mäkinen himself.This game made me respect rally drivers even more than before.			",23,20,13,3,6,2,4

												+ first rally title with a focus on realism since Richard Burns Rally+ physics+ variable weather and stage conditions+ special stages modelled after real stages+ wide selection of cars across several eras+ many graphics!- damage model is waaaaaay too forgiving- only 12 special stages (2 per country) that are reversed and segmented to create more- selection of cars is too diluted, i.e. there is a decent selection of types but most categories only have a few cars that can compete against each other, and sometimes those categories don't make sense (the Audi Quattro featured, for instance, would have been racing against the Lancia 037 and other early RWD Group B cars, not the 1986 AWD monsters)- can't use rally cars on Pikes Peak- hillcimb and rallycross aren't very fleshed out; would have preferred having more rally content			",567,113,37,59,37,6,84

												While playing Dirt Rally you can truly feel the hate and anger Codemasters harbors for all those people who begged and pleaded for a realistic rally game. They decided to make a rally game so perfect, that nobody would ask for one like it again. Because, the reality is, you probably can't drive a rally car. That's where Dirt Rally really shines. It accuratly simulates you crashing into boulders, trees, falling off mountains, and dieing in other totally expected ways. The game is hard, because driving overpowered rally cars over and through gravel mountain roads is hard. And so you'll sink 12 hours into a single track with a single car hoping that at some point you'll reach the finish line. Any dreams of one day becoming a real rally driver are totally crushed along the way as well, just like your rally car that has hit more trees than it has safely passed. 10/10, would spend 4 hours trying to figure out how to get around a single bend again.

								A return to the origins.-Simple yet complex mechanics.-Early Access done right. Content that was promised actually makes it to the game, in the expected times.-Interesting driving model. Forget about the previous Dirt games, in this one you actually have to be skilled to arrive first.-Realistic graphics. No 'pumped-up' graphics with weird PostFX. It has a very natural look.-Online events are a nice way to compete with your friends.-Sounds are exceptional.-Difficult and challenging tracks.If you are looking for a pure rally-sim or you were hooked from the 'Colin Mcrae rally' series, this is the game you are looking for.

								So I'm gonna list the things that left a really good impression in my mind:- Tracks so narrow, I couldn't make a U-Turn in Monte Carlo, after sliding my Abarth. Seriously tho, it's so much better to actually be able to enjoy a realistic looking rally track, instead of the half a mile wide stages in Dirt 3. It's a welcoming feature that I greatly enjoy and really helps with the sense of speed. The tracks are also far more densely populated with vegetation - the ones in Wales especially and some of the higher parts in Greece. I actually felt as if I was racing through a forest and It definetly helps with the immersion.The track surface is also far more varied in terms of texture and it feels way more bumby than previous Dirts. Cars no longer soak up potholes and uneven surfaces as if they weigh 20kgs. Really good job there. - The cars themselves were always really well modeled in Codemasters games and this one is no exception, sounds are epic and violent, damage model is good, accumulating dirt on the car etc. No surprise here. - Co-driver is finally helpful, insted of just riding shotgun and chillin' (although, the abscence of a mini map forces you to listen to the guy, no complaint here, I've always wanted to learn how to read pace notes) - The abscence of a minimap, definetly makes rallying more intense and with the help of Mr. Co-Driver, I'm now always trying to read the stage a turn or two in advance. Helpful tips such as ''logs on the left'', help a lot.Overall, there is tons of potential in this new Dirt. I am geniuenly happy with my purchase, but bear in mind that I've always been a Codies racing game fan. With that said, compared to Dirt 3, I definitely think that this game is heading in the right direction. While at this point, the content is limited to 3 unique settings with multiple stages, and just rally cars from different eras, I expect greatness from Codemasters. P.S. Holy ♥♥♥♥, I can't wait for the Hillclimb mode to come out! PIKES PEAK CODIES - I NEED IT!!!			",140,15,17,8,19,0,17

												The ice sections really try my patience... I've never yelled so much at my computer =)I've got 600+ hours on Dirt3, but will probably never play it again now that this game is out.  This game is much harder to learn and control, but in a good way.  Much more realistic in both appearance and feel than dirt 3.  This game feels like a true rally/RX experience.Be aware before purchasing this game that it is much more down the simulation line than dirt 3.  If you're not up for a challenge learning to maneuver a vehicle on the edge of control, this might not be the game for you.  I would imagine it might be hard to play on the keyboard, though I haven't tried.  Works great with a gamepad or wheel.* Awesome physics.  Makes you feel like you're actually driving a rally car.  * Much improved graphics.  The dusty stages I start to think I can't breath well and need a mask...* Better rally stages.  Not only is everything more realistic, from the scenery to the bumps, dips, rocks, potholes, etc. but they're also longer than the dirt 3 rally stages, which is great.* Overall just feels much more like a rally sim and less like NFS on dirt.  I loved dirt 3, but it was much more ""arcade"" style than this.You may find yourself on the verge of rage-quitting on the icy section of monte carlo like me, only to find yourself unable to do so until you finally finish a clean run.... No other game has given me such a mix of frustration and addiction at the same time.Really the only thing I haven't been impressed with this game is the limited PvP community.  While there's a number of dedicated fans on at any given time, it's not the type of game you can hop on at any hour of the night and find online sessions available.  Still single player offers a lot of enjoyment for those times.			",32,2,6,9,10,0,9

								Initial  review:It's only in early access at the moment, but  this  has to be the  best and most realistic rally game I've ever played.  It's got the Dirt basics with respect to menus etc, but what's different about this game is you get a support team Who repair  your  vehicles. They also learn  to improve  your car through experience.  There's only  a few   rally tracks at the moment (Greece, Wales and Switzerland), but  more to come.  The game is also quite cheap for a AAA  racing game.  The sounds of the vehicle travelling over the roads and tracks, the crashes, the  sound of  gears changing and the engine revving etc, all are pretty convincing.  I'm hoping   they will add this to the Track IR (with 6 degrees of Freedom) and the Novint Falcon peripherals soon as the  ability to look around with the track IR  without using   any keys plus  the  force feedback you'd get with the Falcon would add another dimension to this game.I've never driven a rally car, but  this  makes me  feel like I am.  Oh yeah!  I forgot to mention, the more you crash, the more beat up your vehicle looks.     :)Check the short  intro video HERE ",4945,1930,224,565,875,79,758

												This is the most physically, visually, and audibly stunning rally game out there. And it's only in Early Access!The physics are great (nothing like DiRT 1, 2, or 3), and when racing through the incredibly detailed stages you feel like you're really there :)The best way to describe the physics is 'sim'. Not arcady like the older DiRT games. Optimization is fantastic, I have been able to keep a mostly solid 60FPS at 1080p on my reasonably old GTX 770 and i5 4670, with the Ultra preset and 4x AA (considering it recommends a GTX 780, this was a great surprise for me). Using Nvidia's adaptive V-Sync I rarely notice the fps drops (worst I've had was 50 fps). You could easily run it 100% solid 60fps if you tweaked the settings a bit, but I couldn't be bothered. Content-wise, there is a good amount of cars and tracks, and every single track is beautifully modeled. As it's early access, there will be more content on it's way and not to mention the possibility of DLC once the game is finished. Works great with my G25, and you can tweak all the FFB settings (like how much feedback you want from the tires, etc). Graphically it's beautiful, not much else I can say about that.If you like rally games and sims, this game is for you. If you're looking at getting an arcade game like DiRT 3, then nope you probably won't enjoy it, as it is HARD.Oh, and when your co-driver says ""Don't Cut"", really, don't cut.			",44,6,33,2,6,0,0

Early Access Review
								After playing Dirt 3 again for a bit, I decided it probably was worth a punt on this, despite vowing never to do 'Early Access' again, and despite not being especially good at games generally. Because the +ve reviews which convinced me it was brilliant and worth a try also seemed to universally say this is HARD.And they were right. On both counts. And after a while playing and crashing many, many cars, I actually see both as plus points.Put it like this; this game is not only going to see me shortly ditch my new shiney XBox Elite controller and get my G25 wheel out of retirement, but is also is making me seriously consider splashing out an additional ~£300 for another monitor and GFX card for a 3-monitor display. Yes; it really is that good.If you've liked rally games before and have a decent spec PC, you'd frankly be daft not to get this. Yes; it's quite challenging, and if you're a mediocre player/rallyer like me, you can probably expect not to win anything for quite a long time. But actually, the overal curve seems to be pretty fair. Even if you don't actually win, outright losing is also pretty hard, provided you can at least keep moving vaguely along the track.The majority of tracks I've seen so far are just beautifully done. By far the most interesting in any rally game I've ever tried. And the co-driver navigation is simply brilliant. Sometimes so much information, and so fast that you are still trying to interpret instructions pertaining to 3 turns ago.In short; get it. And a decent wheel. And (at least) 3 monitors. And a new sound system. And a pneumatic seat. And an even better PC (or blade array). And a spare garage to put it all in. And a ticket booth outside to charge people to have a go on it. It'll pay for itself in only about 50 years. (Because you'll be on it yourself most of the time.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Tons of content here starting from campaign mode where you can take part in championships in one of the three disciplines (rally, rallycross or hillclimb) and then there are online events with daily, weekly and monthly challenges where your time gets ranked with all the other players that took part in them.Gameplay- Tons of cars, all with different handling which can make the game completely different when you switch between them- Great variety of maps, each one requires different approach in terms of handling the car well- You can do in depth car setup customization which can make a huge difference how your car handles at different surfaces leading to better end results- Forget about dirt 3 and all of the previous arcade games, this ones takes time and skill to master- Learning to manual shift gears, customize car setup and lots of practice is what it takes to winGraphics- Amazing graphics, haven't seen a better looking racing game so far- Driving in cockpit camera with some bad weather can take your breath away- Car damage is very much present, it also can feel a little bit unreal at some times- All in all, great looking game with stable FPSI would describe the game as a dark souls of rallying.

								The best codemasters published game in 10 years. Enjoying very much so far. Only the default sets are way too understeering, gear ratio is poor and needed to drop steering saturation with g27 to half. To get better feel of grip, tire sounds should be higher and any additions to tire behaviour would be nice. Currently feels that the grip is same for each tire even driving half car on ice and and half on deep snow. Only when tire burst the balanse gets less symmetrical. But excelent  start in early access. Richard Burns Rally is finally getting a proper competitior.			",66,12,8,5,27,0,15

TL;DRHard, but fair, and gives you some breathing room even if you make mistakes. (As I often did)A simcade player's view on Dirt:RallyDisclaimer: This is a review written by nowhere-near-a-pro racer who does it purely for fun and intended for those who are similarly-minded. If any portion of the following causes you to want to type “git gud” in the comments, you're not the intended audience. There are plenty reviews detailing every simulation aspect elsewhere on this page.That said, to my noobrethrenThis is the best type of simulator. Yes the current press releases and this very page boasts mostly about the reworked physics, the painstaking recreation of sufaces and handling, but the biggest thing for me is different, and that is that Dirt: Rally, seeking simulation glory, does not forget to be a fun game. I play games for relaxation and entertainment, and this game provides. It punishes mistakes, yes, but it doesn't do so unfairly, and unlike many other sims a small slip won't ruin your entire day. I was disappointed at first with the exclusion of Codies' famous flashback system, as it could give some breathing room to the tightest situations in other games, but the game without it is not as punishing as I thought it would be. If you get flung far off the track, you can reset with a time penalty. If you get seriously damaged, you can restart the stage — they are mostly not that long despite what it might have looked like with the ""realism"" goal. You lose some of the bonus for restarting, but that has been the case for flashbacks in previous games, so it's clear where it's coming from. The handling system is not easy to master, but largely intuitive, and I've seen some improvements even by the second stage. Word of advice: Don't aim for first place at first. It is intentionally set to be a goal that's hard to achieve. Opponents are nicely spaced out, and in most cases even losing very very badly won't get you a last place.			",141,23,24,11,20,1,19

												Easily the best rally game I have ever played. DiRT Rally brings back the best aspects of old Colin McRae Rally games and combines it with great visuals even better than in older DiRT titles.Beware though, the game is hard. I'm trying to play it on a gamepad without any assists enabled and it's truly challenging - taming a RWD Group B car on ice is nearly impossible!My biggest issue with the game? Multiplayer is Rallycross exclusive - so you can't compete with other drivers on rally nor hillclimb stages. Shame, because DiRT3 did it perfectly :(			",134,18,15,4,20,5,11

												OK... I WILL KEEP THIS SIMPLE...DO YOU LIKE ANY RALLY GAME EVER?DID YOU USED TO LIKE COLIN MCRAE RALLY ON PS1?IF SO THAN WHAT ON ODIN'S BEARD ARE YOU BLOODY WAITING FOR!?!?!?!This game is exceptional... it really is... I was a huge fan of Dirt 3 but I was dissapointed in the small stages in Dirt 3... but guess what... LONG and SHORT stages as well as Pikes Peak's famous hillclimb tournaments... The classes range from 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, kit cars, 1990s 2000's and modern as well as the infamous WRX v EVOs... Numerous countries such as Germany, Finland, Sweden, Greece, Wales and more... Numerous tournaments including online tournaments, you can create your own tournaments and put them online, leaderboards, daily, weekly and monthly challenges to earn more ingame $$$ (which you use to purchase cars, otherwise you must rent them), NO PAY TO WIN WHATSOEVER... completely in-game currency from completing tournaments.... Realistic driving simulation and damage... be prepared, you can puncture your tyres in which it costs you +1:30 on your finish time, you can damage your radiator, you can even stack so hard that you forfeit the race and if your vehicle is beyond repair, costs you the WHOLE championship XD... Co-driver is fantastic... you can even speed up or slow down his instructions to your liking... The replays are nothing short of spectacular... even has some awesome drone camera angles from the air... the camera/view features 2x 3rd person, bonnet, inside windscreen, an awesome cockpit view and my all time favourite, that bumper view where you see no part of the vehicle whatsoever (I use this when in serious mode, as I drive the best in this view which I'm spewing coz I love seeing the car... Even when you create your own tournament, you can restrict the view to cockpit only!This game is also open to steam workshop where you can upload your vehicle setups for whichever car, for other people to download... which comes in handy if you're anything like me and not interested into the nitty gritty of the art of mechanics and aerodynamics... I JUST WANNA RACE!!!!I have my game set to high with shadows and other non-essential extras set to medium and it looks absolutely gorgeous with excellent frames running off a GTX 680M (laptop)... the sound is brilliant really immersive... don't even think about TEAMSPEAK while playing this, even with ALL the audio set to it's lowest, you still won't hear your friends over the roaring and screaming of your engine... I cannot fault this game at all... and I'm being completely honest this game really impressed me, CODEMASTERS really put every ounce of love they had into this game, I feel sorry for their spouses...HOWEVER if I were to really try and look for a fault in this game, I'd say that there are idiots who cheat their way to the top of the leaderboards as I discovered that someone with only 24 hours experience defeated a person with 450 hours experience using the same car by almost a whole minute... and we all know in racing, 1 second is a lot of time! upon inspecting this guys profile, I noticed he has a current ban for cheating (surprise surprise) so I just reported him anyway...Another thing I thought of... it doesn't have an Australian Rally, remember in Colin McRae those awesome as Aussie tracks with the train lines through the bush... well no Aussie tracks :'( Last but not least.... this game has held it's price tag, it goes on special quite often but not enough for people who aren't willing to give this game a go...My verdict....10/10 it really is a modern gem, and one that comes out completed and without the over priced abuse of marketing technique for dlcThis game in my opinion is actually worth $60USDit has really impressed me, and i'm not evcen a car freak or one of those gamers with ONLY racing games... This is the ONLY racing game that I can spend more than an hour playing!THANKYOU CODEMASTERS.... THANKYOU :')			",149,34,2,10,17,0,21

												Let me discribe the 4 stages of rally mania.Stage 1.Driving home after work. 200. Past the supermarket. 50, square left.Don't cut.Into parking to stop.Stage 2.At the supermarket.Straight untill dairy.Right 3 at the cheeses.Into left 3 towards dry foods.Hairpin right. Don't cut.Past the bacons.200 to stop.Stage 3.Cooking dinner.Right 5 around cat, caution.Hairpin - right where my girlfriend left it.To fridge and left 3 bags of groceries in the car.Proceed to tear basilic leaves, don't cut.This is becoming quite punny, to stop.Stage 4.No ... enough, stop, lets cut to the chase. *drives off cliff*Don't cut.Does my girlfriend think I'm crazy?Has this game impacted my life?Is this my final cry for help before I'm consumed by the dark deep fear of cutting?Perhaps.All I know for now is ... don't cut, or bad things will happen.___Seriously though, the game features narrow stages. Going off road just a little means getting the nose stuck in the snow, hitting a rock, trees, or simply making some exhuberant flips and rolls because the ground isn't flat anymore. The maps are really nicely made with a lot of detail, and are very fun to drive. Big improvement over DiRT 3 are the menus: clean, with non-intrusive background music, and plenty of options. Overall a great rally experience.This game is not easy, but you wouldn't like it if it was.			",44,3,7,2,6,0,5

												What can I say? Well, DiRT Rally is the ultimate Rally game, offering a realistic simulation of the real sport. Compared to the older games in the series, this feels truly incredible to drive in as the physics have improved massively. The game comes with a lot of cars and liveries, very detailed tracks and challenging AI.It's well worth picking up the DiRT Bundle in a sale, however this game alone is well worth the full price!

												So, DiRT Rally then.Codemasters, I see you finally did a proper rally game, without that silly Gymkhana stuff that previous DiRT 3 was all about. Kudos. I am not saying that Gymkhana is crap, but knowing the fact that previous games were all about Colin McRae + rally, the last DiRT 3 basically ditched him. Sad. Instead, Ken Block took over unofficially. The situation with DiRT Rally is a little bit different.Firstly, at the time of writing this review, this game focuses mainly on rallying. There are couple of additions: rallycross and Pikes Peak hillclimb. Sadly, only rallycross is supported to play online with other fellow drivers. Multiplayer could mean that it's rallycross that will be mainly played.Secondly, nobody is the leader. This time Codemasters played it safe: not naming the ""unofficial"" leader.Sweet graphics, but I still was expecting a little more than a revamped setup from DiRT 3.Speaking of driving, I am satisfied by physics, they are OK. Since I am using a Logitech Driving Force GT, I enjoy this game quite alot. It's quite hard to get the proper settings for your steering wheel. And that is the only thing that I dislike about this game.9/10.Codemasters - I really hope that in near future this game will outgrow the WRC series by Milestone (or whatever company that made it). It's you, Codemasters, that were always the kings of rally gaming. Make us proud. And you already did.			",26,1,5,0,3,0,2

												WHAT TO EXPECT:If you've played Dirt 3 and are thinking about getting this game, there are a few things you ought to know. While Dirt Rally contains the same basic gameplay and aesthetic, there are a number of key differences in the experience of both games. Foremostly, compared to its predecessor, Dirt Rally is BRUTALLY DIFFICULT. To put it in perspective, imagine how Dirt 3 plays on the hardest/most realistic difficulty. Now add two notches of difficulty above that, and that's EASY mode on Dirt Rally. You can't affect the physics at all, only the intelligence and skill of the AI drivers. I can play Dirt 3 on the hardest difficulty, grab the car with the most horsepower, set it up 100% super trackstar mode regardless of the stage, blast some eurobeat and completely ignore the calls and STILL get first place on every event. When I first started playing Rally, I absolutely got annihilated. You will, upon playing the game for the first time, completely ♥♥♥♥ing suck and will be forced to ""git gud"" in order to achieve anything on the podium. You will also, naturally, be very tempted to punch a hole through your monitor after you ♥♥♥♥ up the last turn on a 15km track that you spent 10 minutes completing and be disqualified because you clipped a tree too hard and smashed up one of your wheels. That might sound very unpleasant, but know that the challenge, supplemented by the very addicting gameplay, will have you practice and practice until you finally ""git gud"" and slab a run with perfect accuracy. The gratification for actually scaling the immense vertical skill curve will make you feel like a genuine badass ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.This game is for those who are looking for a challenge ONLY. If you played Dirt 3 and thought it didn't sufficiently gratify your masochistic tendencies, this is what you want.PROS:-Super addicting gameplay-All the rally cars you know and love now with more character-Much more detailed and sophisticated career mode-Way, way WAY more tuning options-Physics are more betterer-Much more variety in the stages-Handbrake isn't magic drift button anymore-Sound is hugely improved but isn't as good as sound mods for dirt3-Calls are significantly more detailed-Graphics are very good-Extremely extensive controller settings to make driving tailored to the way you want-Hands-down the best rally racing sim out thereCONS:-Optimization is ♥♥♥♥ (I have an MSI Lightning 980Ti and despite being able to max out BF1 at solid 60fps I can barely get that on ""Low"" settings on this game which honestly looks even worse than dirt3 on medium settings). ♥♥♥♥ing HORRIBLE and totally inexcusable for a game that costs this much!-The ""upgrades"" on the cars are not upgrades. If you buy a car that says it has 240 horsepower, that's AFTER you drive it around for a few hours and ""unlock"" the ""upgrades"" that bring it up to that level. It has POTENTIALLY that much HP, but you won't get it until you grind the game. Also behind the stupid ""upgrade"" gate are the advanced suspension settings, so prepare to have your times such balls until you have the ability to actually tune what you want. For a game that demands that you not only drive well but are adept at tuning your car, it's a huge disservice.-Only one navigator voice and he's a limey ♥♥♥♥ who you can barely understand if you don't inhale fish and chips on a daily basis. You cannot adjust the volume of his voice so he will get drowned out by cars that are mid-engine.-Difficult to drive how you'd like without a hugely expensive steering wheel setup, literally impossible without a controller, so don't even try.-Can't choose what stages/events you do in career mode, totally roll-of-the-dice, and some stages are MUCH more difficult and perilous. Prepare to get annihilated on the Greek stages.-If you want to do rallycross events, the only RWD rallycross cars are 350,000 credits while the only affordable ones are FWD. FWD cars are absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing garbage on anything other than snow or ice (and I suppose that's accurate in real life as well). Grinding enough to get 350,000 credits will take probably 7-10 hours. ♥♥♥♥!!!SUMMARY:This game is great. It's just not worth what they're charging. It's both rough around the edges and has quite a few... QUESTIONABLE design decisions that will make you hate yourself for liking this game so much. I wouldn't pay more than $30 for this game, and that's only if you're like me and have nothing that resembles a life and will be proud of yourself for mastering the insane difficulty of this game... or I guess, if you really like rally racing or whatever.

Update 3/2017: Got back on to see if anything has changed for the better, the answer is no. Finally time to uninstall.As someone who got this game almost day 1 of Early Alpha, I keep coming back to try and update my review. I loved this game in its early stages but its now a full release and it's just not that good. It definitely has the best fanboys though, as all the objective and critical reviews and buried deep underneath piles of ""this game is so hard I rolled on the first corner so obviously its super realistic"" nonsense. And I'm sure many will dismiss this as me being bad at the game (despite being on the top 5% of leaderboards) or that I just don't get it (despite having played this entire series since McRae 2.0 all the way through to DiRT3, and various simracers like Assetto), but here is an actual critical review instead of making jokes about cars rolling over.The BadJust on content alone, my decision would be ""No"". The price you pay for what you get is pretty terrible. All things considered, there's really not that much more content than there was in alpha (at the time of review). There's only 5 rally locations and there's only like 3/4 long tracks in each location, which then get broken down into smaller segments to create an illusion that theres more content then there actually is. There's also a lack of cars. The diversity(60s, Group B, Group A, etc) is pretty good, but the choices within these groups is terrible. Most only have 2 or 3 cars to choose from. The new Seb Rally EVO and WRC games put Dirt Rally to absolute shame in this regard. On paper you might look and say ""but there's also Hillclimb and Rallycross"", and I'll reply with those are so underdeveloped it's even less than an afterthought. The content/price is just not there. Now onto the meat of the game. First off lets get this out of the way, not having rewinds is a stupid idea. There is no discussion about this. The fanboys will try to tell you til they are bleeding out of their mouths that this makes the game ""more realistic"" but guess what, you don't have to use them if you don't want to. Not having rewinds is literally a waste of life as the game screws you over with its terrible tire puncture model(more on that later) or with its terrible track edges which defy any and all physics and send 1000kg cars flying 2-stories into the air upon the slightest contact, which I assume is to prevent exessive cutting, but screws over people who just got off track a bit. The track edges have been a well documented issue which was mostly ""fixed"" in the later Sweden and Finland stages, but still exist in all the other tracks. But that's a liveable annoyance compared to the balloon, I mean tire, model. Which again, wouldn't be that bad if you could just rewind instead of a) restarting completely or b) taking a 1:30 penalty for something that in some cases isn't even your fault (and that's the part that really upsets me). Smashing into something with the side of your car will lead to a puncture 100% of the time regardless of how slow the impact was, which can usually be understandable. Where the BS comes in is in situation where damage to the front of the car results in a rear puncture or vice versa. I've rolled the car onto its roof before and I kid you not, as I did so my co-driver called out a puncture. Its this kind of unrelated damage leading to a puncture that will drive you mad. But STILL, that's nowhere near as bad as the Finland Phenomenon where you get punctures for no reason. You can stay on the track 100% of the time and still get punctures out of nowhere. And again this wouldn't be that big of an issue if I could just rewind the BS punctures back, but you can't. Not having rewind is NOT a feature. It just wastes so much of your actual life.And yet ANOTHER bad feature that could be ignored if they simply added rewind: the pacenotes are terrible. Not everywhere but in enough places on enough stages to throw you off. This game makes terrible use of the ""plus"" and ""minus"" modifiers and considers some turns to be ""straight"" enough not to even warrant a ""6"" whereas on other stages turns much straighter will be marked as a ""6"", leading to confusion on how bad the turn actually is. There is no way to change this. Likewise the timings are inconsistent. Some stages you'll be going along wondering why a turn was called so early or furious that one was called way too late. And theres no way to change it (you can set calls to early/normal/late but that applies to ALL of them, not just the ones you want to change). This is another case where a simple rewind (see the theme here?), now knowing that the turn is tighter/wider or earlier/later, would basically turn this into a non-issue. The only thing that a rewind couldn't solve is the UI. Terrible design. Takes 11 button presses to do things that should only take 2. Still a waste of real life, but a minimal complaint compared to everything else. FFB seems to be a pretty subjective topic, but I personally find it not great and inconsistent. Maybe if you want to spend 5hrs digging around in settings you can make something good, but I believe it should work decently out of the box, which it doesn't (at least with default setttings on the G27). Again, subjective and there is a lot of customization available, but this might be the worst default FFB out of all the games I've played.The career mode is a joke, to the point where I've had this game since alpha launch and it took me this long to remember it exists. Its just premade events (like the custom single events you can play) strung along one after the other to make up a ""season"". You can hire different engineers which are better at fixing certain parts as if it actually makes a difference (spoiler alert: it doesn't) and you can unlock skills for them which don't affect repair time or skill or anything actually useful, just how fast you unlock ""upgrades"" for your car. The upgrades are another joke, each car has 3 and I dont even know what they are because that's how generic the upgrade system is. They also don't make any noticible difference after being added onto your car. Zero/minimal effort was put into this. The GoodI don't need to go into this too much since the good reviews are the only ones getting upvoted. But as other people say, graphics are good, probably the best of all rally game out there. I've had very few stutter and pop-in issues with an Nvidia card on max graphics, very rare but they exist. Sound is also probably the best you'll get from the current selection of rally games. For the most part its an immersive experience all around. Pretty good and fairly dense crowds, although definitely should be more dense in some parts (going off of real life footage) and its a shame they don't try to get out of your way. Even if you're trying to turn your car around at <5mph after a spin or something, the crowd won't move and its instant +15sec penalty upon contact. But great in-game and replay camera angles really add to the immersion. The in-car camera also has a bunch of customization movement-wise (up/down, forward/back, etc). The co-driver is a bit quiet and there is no audio slider to change this, but he does speak clearly at least. I'll give it credit for taking a franchise which completely lost its way and attempting to get it back on track. Because that's really why this game exists. Its basically a giant beta for Dirt Rally 2, which is how the devs have been treating it if you follow their diaries the youtube channel. I'm glad this game exists and the racing community is better because it does, but this is far from the ultimate rally game. It is however, a promising step forward and for the future of this franchise. Online leagues are the only thing that keep me coming back, if it wasn't for the bragging rights of beating other people I'd really have no interest left unless some new content or drastic changes were added.

												Dirt Rally ditches the gimmicks and focuses on a hard core rally experience.  The difficulty can be daunting at times, as the courses that stretch the genuinely beautiful scenery can be really hairy to navigate.  I'm playing with a G27 wheel and it makes for a fantatic experience that forces me to put in what I get out.  If I didn't listen to my navigator when he said ""Right 1"" and I go in too hot, I pay the price.  Car damage really does impact your pace and a surprising number of repair variables are present from suspension to radiators to gear box.  The car handling feels right and the phyiscs are spot on.  It looks great and here's the most important part: when you stay focused and put a solid run in on a course, there is a genuine sense of reward.   My biggest gripe is the menu system.  I haven't looked at enough reviews to see if others largely agree, so maybe its just me, but I don't like the layout or how I choose championships, multiplayer or otherwise.  Additionally, multiplayer seems to be relegated to just rally cross, which isn't my cup of tea.  I miss multiplayer traditional rally time attacks.  Again, maybe they are in there, but I can't find it! Strange.  That said, Dirt Rally is the real deal rally experience.  Highly Recommended.			",119,21,5,12,4,0,3

												Richard Burns and Colin McRae has met in heaven. No doubt!Seriously, I've never experienced such a feeling in any other racing game.

								As soon as I saw the title, instant download! I have been chomping at the bit to play a decent DiRT again and this definitely delivers.Pro's:-Great sound effects, cars, surface etc.-Wide variety of weather options for each track (each with day and night variants)-Good selection of retro to modern cars.-Good selection of tracks, each with a reverse option.-Graphics are very nice indeed.Cons:None that I've seen to be honest, yet.You really need to be on your toes in this game, it's not like DiRT 3 where driving each stage was simple.

								 This is a fantastic Rally Sim. Yes, it can be played with a game pad, although of course not as well as a wheel.As many others have stated, it does take time to master the routes, expect hours of frustration before things start to click. But when they do start to click it is a very gratifying and rewarding Sim Rally experience. 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You can pretend to be Petter Solberg oversteering in a Welsh forest. You can pretend to be Petter Solberg oversteering on a snowy Swedish road. You can oversteer in the air in Finland (whilst pretending to be Petter Solberg). You can oversteer off of a cliff in Greece (Petter Solberg is better than this). You can pretend to be Petter Solberg oversteering on Ice in Monte Carlo. And you try to be disciplined like Petter Solberg and not oversteer (too much) on the tarmac of Germany.Basically, you spend your entire rally career going very sideways with your mouth open (like Petter Solberg). Unlike Petter Solberg you will often ignore the co-driver's urgent call of ""Don't cut."" When you ignore this you stop being Petter Solberg and restart the stage from the bottom of the ravine or whilst inside a tree (sometimes both at once).Alternatively give Rally Cross a go and pretend to be Petter Solberg winning the World Rally Cross Championship by oversteering around 3 official circuits.Overall this is a great Petter Solberg simulator. 10/10			",42,1,16,1,10,1,7

								Finally a realistic rally game.

												Pros:- The physics feel fun and realistic- Tracks are tricky and narrow, not perfect set pieces- Audio is excellent and extremely detailed- Customizable and tweakable (e.g. HUD, driver assists, controller responsiveness/sensitivity etc)- Steam CloudCons:- Grass has a semi-noticeable, weird grid-like effect which is apparent on some tracks (only on AMD cards I think)- Rare graphical glitch where the stage is engulfed in black- Online mode lacking- No ghosts or easy way to look up all your laptimes that I've found- When doing time trials, you have to wait like 10 seconds to restart again which adds upPeople often say there are not enough tracks, which is true for the online mode, but only partially true for the rally portion. While there aren't many rally tracks (I think like 10-12), they are very lengthy and even at 150 hours I don't know all the ins and outs of all the tracks (though I do remember most turns). Going back to Dirt 3 and noticing the absurdly short rally tracks is kinda laughable. In fact, everything about the older Dirt games feels way too simple - from the audio to the physics. The old dirt games feel like you're driving a toy on some sort of flat and perfect course.In summary this is one of the few racing games worth playing right now. The pros heavily outweigh the cons. It's especially great if you appreciate realistic feeling, yet still fun racing games. I haven't played a racing game this much since the older Need for Speed games (which I stopped playing when Criterion Games removed manual transmission and casualized the Hot Pursuit series).

												Hands down the best rally sim game on steam. Dirt Rally is aimed at the hardcore rally fans and has a steep learning curve to truly master the game, however also offers difficulty levels challenging enough for new players and veterans of the game. You need a racing wheel or controller if you want to play the game at a serious level. The game offers a lot of replayability and is great value for money in my opinion.The game is visually stunning and offers a wide variety of game modes. You can play through a career mode, race in online multiplayer or set up leagues and compete against your friends best times. There are 6 different rally locations with 12 stages on each, as well as various Pikes Peaks routes and rally cross events. There's plenty of cars to choose from and the game isn't related to previous ""dirt"" games other than in the name, so you can pick and choose what cars and stages you want to race without being forced into any unwanted races.

												I just freakin' love it! The successor to Richard Burns Rally! The first and the most important of all: it's a SIM, not an arcade game. Don't be disappointed if you crash in your first corner, just keep trying, it's HARD at first try. But that feeling, when you achieve some results - absolutely brilliant, incredible and rewarding! Everything is perfect about this game, and nope, I'm not biased. It's that great! And it will get even better! Don't ignore the game just because it's Early Access (in this case, Codies use this Steam feature to their advantages, really!). It's the rally simulation we (rally fans / sim players) all waited for a long time. The tracks are completely stunning, built with so much detail, creativity and attention - the whole environment is alive while you are rushing towards the finish line, either on gravel, tarmac, ice or snow. You have a really intensive and real connection to the surface, that's why I recommend playing it with a better wheel which has Force Feedback. The cars sound great, like nowhere else in a rally simulator. The Steam Workshop support is a nice addition, as you can get some controller settings and great car setups for specific tracks from other players, if you want to improve your stage times. The v1.10 update added some great tutorials for beginners, for those who aren't familiar with rally racing or even racing in general. I find those videos a great addition to the package. The tracks are in Wales, Greece, Monaco, Germany, Finland, Sweden, USA (Hillclimb), Norway (Rallycross), England (Rallycross), Sweden (Rallycross), and they are all real-world tracks (if you don't believe me, check out my guide at the bottom of my review)!The only thing I can say as a negative is that it doesn't have a multiplayer mode for rally, with staggered starts, but I hope we can get it somehow, sometimes.The way they handle community feedback is absolutely brilliant. DiRT Rally's Early Access period was it's best period, and the best EA I've ever seen. During the progress we went through the simulator evolved and got better based on feedback. Kudos to Codemasters, they are going in a really, really great way. Colin McRae would be proud! :-)

Early Access Review
								It's the rally game we always wanted, and it's so dirty.  Driving at night in the rain is probably the most realism I have felt from a racing game.  There's also a career mode where you can upgrade your car.  It's perfect in my books.  Plus we don't have to wait to play it!  It feels like a finished product, perfectly optimized on the absolute highest settings it will go I'm getting like 70-100+ FPS easily without any issues with a really old processor.  Insanely well optimized.  Flaw?  Career mode needs a bit of a tweak.  You can't really redo races, and there's only one state of progression, no going back, you lose your cash you're out of luck.  Can't really make any mistakes at all during your entire progress through the game with the exception of resetting each time during a race to the start.  I was just trying it out and after my first little set of races I did horribly because I crashed my car basically, and got a DNF for that race.  So basically a horrible fail and I lost more money than I earned.  It was the first race so I just wanted to start over but you can't.  There's an option to reset your game which I did, and it resets everything including your games' stats.  Sort of sucks, considering if you were playing a career mode for a long time and you made a few mistakes down the road (fall off the track?) and don't have time to finish restarting, you would have to basically reset your entire game save including everything you've ever done.  Much different than Dirt 3 where you can basically redo those tour races over and over until you got perfect on each one.  You never had the risk of losing it all because you had a friend come over and had to exit the game and lose your whole career mode lol.  I left suggestions on the developer's feedback forum, I hope they can realize this oversight.  Anyways, having played the game for a few days, I no longer see this as a big drawback (not that it really was in the first place), but you just have to play this game differently.  You have to seriously do well on your championship races or don't even do them, but since you can endlessly restart you can keep redoing them until you get a not-horrible-run and then continue to the next race, you'll always come out at a profit and if you are really good and you can complete all of the races without restarting the game rewards you for that. My favorite part of the game are the online races.  Not interactively online but challenges that we get to do every day, week, and there is also a monthly event.  This basically ensures the game will always be somewhat fresh.  In the challenge, you can't reset the round, you have one shot to complete it and if you fall too far off the track you could end a 24-race monthly challenge in an instant and never be able to attempt it until the next month.  It's refreshingly difficult and you have to really pay attention, but you don't have to really sweat it because you can practise as much as you like arcade mode.  Pretty cool game. I'd like to see the vehicle upgrading enhanced a little bit.  You don't have direct control over it, you hire crew and the crew automatically does upgrades for you.  It's pretty weird but I guess they thought it was a good idea, I'd rather have to save up money and have to buy individual parts or at least have a level 1-5 on each part and buy upgrades for them.  Their system might work out okay, better than nothing, but the repair system in between races should be tweaked a bit.  If you have 85% wheel condition you can repair it up to 90% condition?  It should be more specific in which parts are getting fixed, and let you choose.  Maybe not super specific but for example your headlights, that's bundled in with 'body', you might want to put a lot of repairs into the body/headlights because your upcoming race is night time and it's pretty much impossible without lights and if you have 60% body condition and repair it to 70%, are your lights even going to be fixed?  If not, that was a waste of your repair time, but I'd much rather the game let me pick exactly what needs to be fixed.  You might have 1 wheel missing at the end of a race, it would be nice to just have that wheel and maybe your headlights fixed, seems pretty reasonable for a game this hardcore with it's permadeath 24 race rally runs, they should at least grant you a bit more control over it.  All in all, a helluva time, 10/10, so great that we get to play the game as they are developing it.			",4119,1557,197,486,660,69,658

I am blown away by how much love and passion has gone into making this game, and the dev team have been absolutely superb with their efforts and communications throughout. Not only did they keep us in the loop, but they involved the community to the point where we all had a hand in developing what is the best and the most immersive rally game, to date. **-------------------------------------------------Never has an early access game impressed me so much. The quality of this game early on is fantastic, and the content that this game has is just what I've been waiting for since Richard Burns Rally; my goodness! The visuals, the sound and the feel of this game is incredible. There are few things better than ripping through the Welsh forests in a lovely Mk2 Escort in Dirt Rally. Quality product. I'm very excited to get my hands on the final version. The stages feel alive, the cars feel like they have actual weight to them, and the handling is challenging yet all of the fun.

												A big thumbs up. The driving to me feels worthy to be called an RBR successor, and it's definitely that type of sim-realism that they've gone for with this game. The roads are narrow, the cliffs are steep, the cars are fast and when the co-driver says ""don't cut"", you'd better do as he says.Downsides include:* No content modding support at the time of writing (just after launch), nor do we know yet if they plan to make new content themselves* Cars are in ample supply, though some classics are omitted for licensing reasons I assume. No Toyota Corolla for example.* Locations are varied, but don't amount to a great deal of drivable road. Each event (6 now) contains 2 long stages, and these stages are in various configurations for a full rally, by cutting them in 2 and doing them again and then the reverse of all of those. I certainly enjoy the reverse stages as much as the forward, but driving the exact same stage twice in the same direction can get tedious if an event gives you A reverse, then A, then AB, then B, and then B reverse all in a row.* No rally school or playground to mess around in, though you can always just load up any stage on any event in any car in custom event mode.* The co-driver is very important, and you learn to trust him over time. But at the same time there are 1 or 2 turns per location where he calls a turn much wider than it is and you wish you could punch him in the face for it. It's not often so you eventually learn that a particular turn is coming and what it really is, but there's no pacenote editor right now to fix it properly.All in all, yes I've mentioned a bunch of negatives, but overall the postives vastly outweigh them. Even as a newcomer you'll learn the tricks quickly enough to progress through the cars and after 57 hours of driving the stages in various configurations I can't say I'm tired of driving them yet. Even if they deliver no additional content down the line through free or paid DLC, and even if they don't support modders doing it for them, the game is fully worth the price of admission for what it currently offers.

												Best rally sim out there. so much detail, like the engineblock and cooling fans moving, great physics and the sound of each car is just spot on! would love to see some new cars tho (but i heard a lot of legendary rally cars have licensing problems, so a lot will never be in there.) but they could add some more variants of some cars. e.g. the group b version of the renault 5 or the rally version of the e2 quattro. or even some group s concepts.

												I had so much joy with DiRT 3, but there's more. Let's have a close look to DiRT Rally.DiRT Rally is a rally game with plenty of modes like plain rally, rallycross and hillclimb. In the career, you start up with the oldest rally cars you can imagine of and pick either generated championships that go harder and harder or your own created championships. Over time you earn money and can buy some better cars and hire trained engineers that keep your car alive and install handy upgrades.Graphics, sounds and physics are a impressive step and don't need overkill hardware. Recently, VR support was added which I find fancy. I haven't one of those VR-headsets yet, though.Be aware that DiRT Rally is pretty much deep and demanding, therefore I'd rather call it a simulator, a tough one. There's no map, just You, the Co-driver and the car. Not all the damage can be repaired at once and it even decreases the earnings if you decide to restart. There's only one try for the online time trials also. In the other hand, you can activate driving aids if you need to. It's important to find the most comfy steering method and the car's tuning for you. Keep a cool head and take breaks over time. Do you love cars and won't mind a bunch of dirt? Would you accept the challenge? Get it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Short version:Bought the game.Started playing with keyboard.Broke my fingers.Bought a gamepad.Can't play properly anymore, cause my fingers don't move quite well as they used to.10/10, would break my fingers again.Long version:Buy the game, it's well worth it. It's a proper rally simulation in Dirt series, something you did not expect. Runs exceptionally well on High and Mid-Low end systems. Great sounds, especially 5 cylinder Audi's. Very hard to master, but I'd suggest to turn off almost all asists, and leave the ones you can't live without, in my case - ABS, level 2. You start your carrer with FWD Lancia or MINI. Pretty hard enough to control, top speed felt like already being the highest I could handle without kissing a tree. Finished second overall, bought an RWD BMW. Now I understood, that keyboard with RWD is just finger-bone-snapping experience, throttle control is absolute madness, sudden oversteer and everything else combined made my RWD journey very memorable, that's why I went straight to electronics shop. Still, nailed 3 stages with a pretty nice looking wreck. Gamepad is connected, I will end this now, cause I need to play some more.As I already stated earlier, buy it. Worth every Euro - Back to basics, the building stones of proper Colin McRae rally.			",57,3,13,14,13,0,8

												This is a great rally sim game, it manages to be challenging throughout the game since the difficulty increases as you get better and there are no flashbacks.  The driving mechanics are good, there are lots of cars, lots of stages. And codemasters are steadily adding new content and improving the game.Beginners can drive with assists but you get better stage times without.So if you are up for a challenge it will be a fun and rewarding ride, i recommend playing with wheel or a gamepad.9/10			",136,50,2,10,11,1,2

								The true sequel that the Colin Mcrae/Dirt series deserves. It is also the most realistic game in the series, with closer to reality driving and longer rally stages than the previous 2 Dirt games.Since it's still in early access, more goodies are to come for this fantastic rally game.Plays very well with an Xbox 360 controller. Recomended even if in Early Access as it has a generous amount of content for playing around with for now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I remember the day I saw DiRT2. Those fireworks, Hollywood style, the gymkhana. That day i felt like something died inside me. Then DiRT3 came, and wasn't much better, let's face it. And here I was, 5 hours ago still feeling something dead inside, wishing for a decent old school rally game...But I have to wish no more. Out of the blue this game came out and hands down, so far looks and feels awesome. Could be one of the best rally games ever without a doubt. No more fireworks, no more Hollywood bs. Only mud, dirt and nothing but rally.GraphicsGame looks fantastic. There's a few things that Codemasters should improve like the spectators. They kinda look ugly for a 2015 game. And there's a few visual bugs related to shadows but nothing too severe. Interiors are BEAUTIFUL, full of details and speaking about details, the game is full of them inside and outside the vehicles. The mud, the burning brakes at night...SoundAgain, fantastic job. Cars sound incredible, specially the group B. You can even hear the window rattle. Soundtrack is nice, nothing too fancy but does the job.GameplayNow, this is where the game proves that is not a DiRT4. Rally is closer to simulation than ever before. There's a few options to make the experience a lil close to arcade (ABS, TCS, stuff like that) but if you turn them all off the game feels pretty realistic. I can't say how close is to RBR but one thing is certain, this is completely different to DiRT or even CM.And they added a few features, like upgrades for the cars (Nothing too powerful to make that Mini the ultimate rally car) and staff management, where you choose the team, pay their salaries, fire them and ofc each one has different stats that affect for example, the amount of damage they can repair between stages.OverallI have to recommend this. It's been too long since we had an old school rally game. And so far looks promising, there's a few things they have to fix, content to add (Included hill climb. they have confirmed Pikes peak) and many cars to come before release. So far it includes 17 cars and 36 stages (You can set the hour, included night) so there's plenty to play around till the next update.It is kinda awkward to say this, but... Thank you Codemasters.And remember, ""Being fast is about skill, not raw speed"". Otherwise this happens...

Early Access Review
								After a few hours, I have to say I'm very impressed. Coming from simulators such as iRacing and Assetto Corsa, I would say DiRT Rally is in the same league. I have some experience with Richard Burns Rally which is touted as being the best driving simulation available, which I would absolutely agree with. It's hard for me to compare the two as I haven't played RBR in a while, however, I remember RBR just feeling right when I first tried it. DiRT Rally also gave me this feeling so they must be doing something right. Considering RBR was released 10 years ago, it's about time somebody challenged to be the king of driving simulation.The handling is raw and unforgiving. The sounds, especially in third person, are perfect. The graphics are good enough; which I don't mind as long as the handling feels good. Steering wheel support seems OK. using a G27, I set the degrees of rotation to 270 in logitech profiler and turned the wheel strength down to 80%, wheel weight to 40%. There doesn't seem to be any clutch support which is odd. I'm using elastic bands to convert my H-shifter into a sequential shifter. A handbrake is definitely a requirement now. In the next few days I'll be designing a 3d printable off/on handbrake which will use an Arduino Pro Micro as the USB device controller. Unfortunately I don't think a handbrake axis is supported.The pace notes let the game down at the moment. I'm forever shouting at my virtual co-driver when he calls a turn too late and I go flying off a cliff. To add to this, I don't like the graphical pacenotes overlay. It's very hard to distinguish what's coming up next at a glance if you didn't hear the co-driver say it (I know you wouldn't get this benefit IRL but it's poorly executed). I also think the pacenote graphics look childish and overly stylised which isn't in keeping with the clean and serious UI/attitude of the game.The in-game cameras are another slight let down. For the time being I'm forced to use the dash cam because the cockpit cam is too far back. I'd also like a bit more flexibility in the replays to watch on the TV style cams all the time. I understand why they've done it this way but it's a game, the devs have the ability to use any cameras they want.Another thing that annoys me is the vehicle recovery mechanic. Sometimes I'm not given a chance to recover the vehicle myself and I'm magically dumped back on the track with a time penalty. Something Richard Burns Rally did well was a quick animation showing spectators flipping the car back over for you. It just adds a bit of immersion rather than a magical lazy recovery to the middle of the track.I'm not too fond of the progression aspect of the championship. I'd prefer to test my skills as a driver rather than my patience. Having said that, the mini was pretty fun.All things considered I'd definitely recommend this game. With a bit more work and more content I can see it being really great. Thank you to codemasters for taking a step back and assessing the market. I've had enough of the assist ridden Monster Energy adverts you've been putting out over the past few years.			",95,3,27,5,24,6,9

Teal DeerDevelopers: Codemasters Racing StudioPublishers: CodemastersInitial release: Dec 2015Genre: Racing, Off-Road, Rally#Worth/NotWorth: #DefinitelyWorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationVersion 0.9This is the Rally game you've always wanted. Focused on pure point to point racing. No more Gymkhana. After getting used to the physics in this game, going back to older DiRT games feel like arcade folly. There are 3 basic modes Rally, Hill-climb and recently the added Rally X Cross (which is the only mode wherein other cars share the road with you.)Updates are frequent with new cars and tracks. Each track being a location with very specific road conditions and each rally being different sections of that track including the mirror versions of those different sections. Tarmac, snow/ice, loose gravel of varying sizes which all give a different feel when driving. Mud behaves differently than dry dirt as does the vehicle depending on your drivetrain. It'll make you want to buy a wheel if you didn't have one already. Lots of assists and bonus credits for turning them off. For easy entry into the series but still very difficult to master. There are no more flashbacks making racing much more intense. In its stead is a time penalty of resetting your car back onto the track. A nice trade off is you can avoid this penalty by getting back onto the track yourself before the timer deems you unable to get back. By far the most realistic entry into the series, I'd even extend that to all rally/off-road racing games; Graphically and more importantly the physics therein. Cars receive damage and even retain that damage through the races and must be repaired in between with possible time penalties for 'over repairing' beyond your given time to repair. You will build a team, crew chief and other members. That get better and more efficient the more they work with you. Make sure you keep their contract up as these people you hire will allow you to fix more things in between races and keep your vehicle in tip top shape even if you aren't the best driver in the world. This is quintessential if you're into off-road racing of any variety.Follow my curation for more ",1041,295,48,106,93,7,96

								DiRT goes back to its roots. There is no Gymkhana here. It is just pure rally racing, and it is not as forgiving as previous versions of DiRT. This is much more of a sim racing game than recent DiRT games, and moreso than the WRC games too.I have been playing the game with an Xbox 360 controller, and with no assists on it is challenging to stay on the course. You have to watch your speed as you approach turns, make sure you enter and exit the turns without drastic changes in throttle and steering, or else you will end up in a tree. At least you can reset your car onto the course if you do crash, but you will take a time penalty and your car may be damaged. I imagine the game would be even more fun with a wheel and pedals.The courses are narrow and stages are longer than in DiRT 3. Damage is in the game (cannot be turned off) and it will effect your car. I had a right front puncture in the middle of a stage and had to finish the stage with the car pulling to the right the whole time. That was nerve wracking but realistic. One time I went off so fast my car was totaled, forcing me to retire from the event.All the typical camera angles are here, from a follow view, bumper cam, hood cam, dashboard cam, and the traditional cockpit cam. There are a lot of graphical settings to adjust to your computer's abilities. Buttons can be remapped too, which may seem like a minor thing but some games (The Crew) have left this option out.There are some shortcomings to DiRT Rally as it stands right now. I cannot hear the pace notes and I'm not sure why. I tried various settings but they just do not play for me. Hopefully this will be tracked down and fixed soon because driving blind (there is no course minimap) is tricky. The selection of locations and cars is a bit sparse for now, but this is early access and more are coming. One other feature I would like to see is the ability to adjust sensitivity for the controller, to fit different tastes. I would like the option to turn it down slightly.Overall this is a good racing game for early access. There already is a lot of polish to the game and it has promise. This is not your typical DiRT game meant to be blasted through without practice. With patience it can be an enjoyable experience.			",79,1,20,5,14,1,32

												This is perhaps the most engaging, immersive rally game - if you let it be. That means; all driver assistants off (maybe except allowing a weak setting of ABS if you play on a keyboard) and first person perspective only. The sound and visual effects of the game are pretty persuasive, and the handling of the cars seems very credible to me. Obviously I haven't driven actual rally cars on actual rally tracks, and therefore I won't pretend to be some sort of expert on the topic like many others will. I have however driven cars for 28 years, 10 of these off road racing on fields and I am a technically inclined driver. I live in Scandinavia, where we often deal with snow and ice in winters. On that background, I will say that the handling feels very ""expected"" - when I expect a car to slide, it will do so, and in the direction expected. It will also grip when expected, and many real world driving and rallying techniques are responded well to by the game design.The menu structure and the way you enter events, the events you may access and the cars feel a bit restricted. I'm a casual gamer, and I play often with other people, so to me, DiRT is a bit of a ""filler"", that I start when I feel like a bit of driving around. In that regard, it feels very grind-y, and I've yet to unlock several cars and classes. That's a bit bad, and although I never cheat in any game, it does sometimes makes me want to google for an unlock-all cheat.I also feel that the more powerful cars may be too much of a challenge on keyboard. I do have a steering wheel setup, I just never bother installing and uninstalling it. However, as far as keyboard controls go, the initial cars are pretty easy to control, but progressing towards e.g. an Audi Quattro or even more modern, powerful cars, and it suddenly feels like you'll have to drive significantly slower than what the car is actually capable of, to remain in control when using a binary input like a keyboard.All in all, the game is a credible, immersive and realistic rally simulator. If you imagine yourself as the kind of car gamer, who will disable all driver aids and stick to first person mode, you'll be rewarded with an actual challenge - getting there is easy, but getting there first is suitably hard (although I find it too easy to come in 2nd or 3rd). If you like driver assists on though, I really wouldn't recommend this game though - I think you'd have more fun in a game that is actually build to cater to that taste of car game, than tweaking this game to suit you.

												This game offers a pure rallying experience with almost no distraction. Although there is only one car on the track, you have to push to the edge of your skills to get a better result while maintaining control of your car.The game is frustrating at first, I crashed at every corner and destroyed my car during the first race. But, it has the magic power to keep me playing. I guess the power is hope. ""What if I didn't crash at that corner?"" The hope of getting better keeps players playing. As I keep driving, I crash less and get more and more confident. The game encourage players to switch off assists both by extra rewards and the possibly better stage time and this became the first driving game I dare play with all assists off. I switched off one assist every championship and now I feel confident controlling my car.10/10 I even rally in my dreams. ",19,6,1,8,4,0,2

												Finally a RALLY game! No Ken Block, no Travis Pastrana, no gymkhana.Feels a lot like DiRT 1 which is a good thing.Point to Point rallying at it's finest. If you don't have respect for your surroundings you will DNF in the first 5 seconds of a race every time. It's a pretty hard game, like it should be! No one ever said driving 120 mph through the woods should be easy :)Lot's of cool cars that are actually used to rally in real life.The only con so far for me is the lack of Rally raid style races with the offroad trucks in a point to point race with others racing at the same time. I really enjoyed that style of race from DiRT 1.Overall a perfect rallying game.11/10  Colin McRae Would be proud			",122,16,4,17,12,1,32

 General Dirt Rally is a brilliant rally game. Brilliant graphics and hope for features to come in the future. UI The UI is simple and clean. It looks very effective and can be easily navigated from one area to another. The help of quick selection makes the transition of moving from settings to game play instantaneously. No problems here. Graphics The graphics are very good, even when playing on a lower preset they are still top-notch. Game Play It’s no arcade, this feels like a simulator. You lose grip on gravel, your wheel feels loose on the ice! It’s the best Rally simulator game yet, and also has a licence for the World Rally Cross Championship, so not only are you sliding around in the mud on stages but are also wheel to wheel racing over jumps and joker sections!I highly recommend the game to anyone that has a love for rally, although be aware it’s not for the faint hearted.

												DiRT Rally is the rally sim that rally fans everywhere have been waiting for.If your attention strays for 1 second, you may find yourself going in for a frenchie with a tree at 80mph.Codemasters took the risk of taking on this in essence, side project based on user feedback a couple of years back. They decided to go down the early access route and I can tell you from a day 1 player, this has gone from strength to strength and by far the best early access game I have put my time into and also rally sim game. This area has been barren for a number of years since Richard Burns Rally came out and to imagine that people are still playing and modding that game showed there was still a desire for these games out there.If you are expecting a DiRT 3 sequel, be wary. This game is HARD. You have to actually practice proper rally techniques rather than the usual arcade brake, turn and accelerate. You do that in this game and either you will oversteer or understeer off the road. This game doesn't forgive. Even after my 110 hours in the game (possibly the most in any racing game to date) I still manage to crash either based on my split second ignoring my co driver or an error in speed.But that is the beauty of this game and that is why I have so many hours in it. It makes you want to improve. Don't expect to be topping leaderboards in the championship mode, hell even coming 5th when you start is a godsend. You have to upgrade your car and your driving skills. Slower is generally quicker I have discovered. Floor the throttle and you will find yourself in a smooth embrace with a tree.If you are into PVP, they have also signed a deal with the FIA World Rallycross Championhip which brings some well known tracks and a number of the current cars from the IRL championship including Petter Solberg's DS3 and the Fiesta. This is a great experience so long as you get some people who are willing to play fair but that is the same in all pvp.TLDR Section!Pros-- Great driving physics- Wide range of cars and tracks- Daily, weekly and monthly events for chances to earn extra cash competing against all other players on the leaderboard- Steep learning curve (this is if you love a challenge and improving, if not look down)Cons-- Steep learning curve, part 2 (this is not a game for the casual racer. It will take practice and time to get good and find the enjoyment in it- While there are a number of different tracks, you will find some of the longer tracks cut in half to count as some extra stages rather than every stage be the same. Personally doesn't bother me though.- Damage engine isn't very advanced I think due to a dated engine. I imagine if they knew how popular this would get they would have started from scratch.I throughly recommend this game and can't wait until the Oculus Rift consumer version releases so I can get fully 'into it'!

								Summary: If you (like me) loved the rally events of the Dirt series, you will love this game. More challenging than it's predecessors, the learning curve is steep but rewarding. I've played the first two full events available, and I could NOT pause the game, itch my face, or check my phone. This is adrenaline pumping sim rally car driving in the best way. Wow. Having played Dirt 2, Dirt 3, and Showdown, each with a X360 controller, and Logitech G21 wheel/pedals, I've been loving the Dirt series for quite some time, in various ways. Dirt 2 was a dream. Yes, there were various events that I didn't like as much as others, but having completed the game various times, it is definitely enjoyable. Dirt 2 had long rally races unlike other racing games I had played prior. I grew up trail riding on dirt bikes while camping, and nothing had ever come close to creating this feeling of adventure and adrenaline. Since the release date, I've enjoyed Dirt 2 with all setups at my disposal, oddly my favorite of which was the X360 controller (a slight blend of sim and arcade), but getting the game to work with my Oculus DK2 and the G21 was incredible. Although I still haven't managed to get the DK2 to provide head tracking, so I suppose it's more like your head is bolted looked straight the whole time. Ah well. Dirt 3 had some more recognizable rally events (with relation to this game, heavily wooded tight tracks), yet an abundance of new and less enjoyable event types. With the graphical improvement of 3, it was hard to resist playing, but I, sadly, never completed the game given the various other event types. (I'm looking at you gymkhana!) This game was better suited for my G21, but ultimately the tracks just weren't... right with me. Perhaps it was the slightly heavier sim element, but with event types that were arcade feeling that put me off, I also missed the Dirt 2 desert trail feeling. Showdown, I played very slightly. Dirt Rally is a very humble new beginning for the Dirt Series (ditching the numbers, aside to Showdown) which focuses on my favorite aspect of the game. Although in it's current form it does not include my favorite vibe of track (desert trailblazer style), the aesthetic, customization options, sim options, X360 compatibility, and all around feeling of the game are present in the best way yet. The graphics are fantastic (running at 70FPS average on Ultra) and FEELS like trail-riding, although trapped in a car. I would ask Codemasters to include dirt bikes if possible, but they have the perfect formula for off road rally cars. Oh, and lastly, Codemasters, please add paved parts of maps. The feeling of getting off the vibration centric dirt roads of Dirt 2 onto pavement in a 350+HP car and hauling a** for a minute was incredible.			",161,28,8,16,19,2,5

								Well well well, codemasters! I loathed the F1 series, I hated the way the DiRT series went and then this little diamond came along, unannounced out of the blue.Now my opinions;FFB is slightly better now (Still isn't the best and will need refinement).The graphics are very good. I'm able to run with it completely maxed at ultra for the settings it allows.No flashy, WHAM-BAM, 'merica menu's.Unforgiving career mode, make one mistake and you'll struggle to get podium.You have to listen for the co-driver and at the moment I'm keeping the visuals on too. (It's that bad!)The feeling of the driving isn't as bad as full on sim but it isn't as arcady as the others.G27 preset out the box.Plays like a real rally season, repairs cost time (if you are slower than first you can make time up without repairing), you don't get to repair after every stage and a restart costs you bonus cash from the final pay cheque.Really cannot fault this game, it won't be the ultimate sim that some would like, but car setup isn't just as simple as shocks and dampers either. Camber is there and i forget what else. You have to use a car more and more to get the advanced setup options tho.Peugeot 205GTi Evo 2, Lancia Delta S4, Escort Mk2, RS200, Audi Quattro and a Metro 6R4. In heaven here!I say buy it and see for yourself.Edit*Want to challenge your friends to time attacks? Steam friend leaderboards Incorporated.Want daily, weekly and monthly challenges?

Get behind the wheel and you're in for the ride of your life...Update 3 - November 5th, 2015Despite skipping the previous 2 big updates, I would like to focus on the state of the game after the latest update - titled ""Modern Masters"" - instead of talking about the earlier ones. Not only does it introduce more rally cars - and even one new class of cars - but also a bunch of long-awaited features and an overhaul of the Group B (4WD) and Group A physics.So far I spent the majority of my playtime since the release of this update using the Peugeot 205 T16 Evo 2. Since I already had spent a fair bit of time with this car previously, the difference was very noticeable: The car is more nervous now, but also very nimble and has a lot less grip than before. These changes also serve to make it feel even more powerful because it has become harder to tame the beast. But when you do it's an absolute blast. The FFB, while feeling a little lighter compared to other cars, does convey everything you need to know about the state of the car and the road surface. Every car does feel different in DR, and the FFB combined with the v2 physics - as far as implemented - further improve upon this.Original reviewIt's hot, and the glaring light of the midday sun hurts my eyes. I depress the clutch and put the car into first gear. One more glance to my co-driver - he's absolutely focused on the task ahead. My right foot hits the gas pedal and the mid-mounted 4-cylinder turbo- and supercharged engine screams in reply. A cold shiver runs down my spine. ""A thrill ride through beautiful Greece, in a Lancia Delta S4 - a car that generates 400 bhp at less than 900 kilograms weight - what could possibly go wrong?""A lot, as it would later turn out. The ""GO!"" signal echoes through my head; I drop the clutch and the bullet I'm sitting in shoots forward, screaming, waving its rear and sending large amounts of gravel to the sides.The first bends dart towards me at unreal speed. After passing through the first of them without an incident, I fall into a trance; a blur of steering, shifting and listening to my co-driver, who spits out his pacenotes as precisely as a machine.Everything goes well for about 3 or 4 kilometers. Then it happens: I miscalculate the trajectory through a rather unremarkable turn. My mistake sends the car flying down a slope, all four wheels losing contact. It's nothing short of a miracle we don't hit one of the nearby trees. The question is this: Do we call for help and risk losing time or do we push ahead, hoping to get to higher ground again? I opt for the latter, and through what seems like another miracle make it back to the track without damaging the car or losing too much time.No more events in the next sector, but then tragedy happens. I lose control over the car for a brief moment, and my efforts to correct the mistake are in vain, thanks to the loose surface beneath the car. It slides forward and sideways, and I prepare for the worst. But all I feel is a slight bump. However, the hissing sound from the left means that at least one of the car's tires were damaged but I can't tell if it's the front or rear. ""Oh great, this is going to be fun"", I think to myself.I back up and accelerate again, then try to assess the damage. We can continue, sure enough, but for how long? The car, previously a nimble and fast race horse, starts to transform into something else. The reactions are getting slower and less precise, and I do not know how much longer the tire will hold.About 1.5 kilometers later I'm getting my answer: With a loud bang the tire, or what was left of it, disintegrates. The scraping noise from the back of the car doesn't exactly inspire confidence, and the first few meters confirm my worst fears. The race horse I once rode has turned into a murderous three-legged bull intent on killing me and my co-driver.Going full speed as I was before was out of the question now. We surely wouldn't make the top places, but hell if I let some blown tire end our rally prematurely! Carefully directing this out-of-control cruise missile through every bend on our way, I find it harder and harder to keep it on the road. Each steering input I make is answered by an opposing reaction, randomly changing our course to everywhere but the road ahead.Every little bump turns into a deathtrap, every corner into pure madness. What remains of the stage ahead of us becomes an odyssey, but then I finally see the pre-finish markers and my heart skips a beat in relief. It is only then I realize the gaping abyss to the right of the road. Relief turns to terror as I lose control of the car once more, but I quickly regain it before getting too close to the edge. I accelerate the car - still veering left and right - and shift into third and then fourth gear, before finally crossing the finishing line with a smile on my face.These were the scariest 8 minutes of my life, but also among the most fulfilling. As I look at the leaderboard I prepare to find myself way down... But I'm shocked to find myself close to the better entries, just barely missing an entry in the top tier of this event. Guess not everyone was as lucky as getting away with a blown tire.Preliminary ReviewIs this game worth getting?Yes.Here are the ""buts"": The game is still in Early Access; there is a decent amount of content, but many stages have overlapping sectors. On the other hand the locations differ greatly in terms of look and feel, especially when it comes to the actual surface. There are 5 different rally locations overall: Greece, Wales, Monte Carlo, Germany and Finland. At least one more location is to be released soon, so far only known as ""Winter Wonderland"".The core of any simulation that ultimately decides if it fails or prevails is the magic that happens between the tires and the road - the physics. Don't be fooled by looking at Codemaster's racing and rally games from the more recent years; make no mistake, THIS IS A SIMULATION. If you absolutely must compare it to Richard Burns Rally (and if you're into racing simulations, chances are you will), Dirt Rally feels *slightly* more 'forgiving' overall; however, to be quite honest I would partially blame this on some issues with RBR itself rather than only DR. No matter how you look at it, Dirt Rally is *not* an arcade game (but it does offer some driving aids on which I can't personally comment since I haven't used any of them).Ultimately, the one issue that is bothering me until now is the spread out content. This game is titled Dirty *Rally*. Having Hillclimb and Rallycross Events (even the official WRX license!) is (somewhat) nice to have, but there isn't that much diversity when it comes to content for these modes. There are basically two RX locations and one (and a half) hillclimb locations. The car selection for these modes is okay, though nothing to brag about IMHO (hillclimb, I'm looking at you!).The issue I have with this is that there currently isn't enough content for these modes to make them enjoyable for extended periods of time. And let's not forget that developing these things and putting them into the game actually takes development resources *away* from the core of the game - rally.So my hope is that we will see a long-time support from CM for Dirt Rally, adding more content to the game (preferably as free updates, IF possible) or officially supporting the modding scene. However, given the current state of things the later isn't very likely so my guess is we'll see some paid DLC sometime after the 1.0 release of the game.SummaryWe've been waiting for a new king of rally sims for too long, and Dirt Rally looks like it's going to be it. Definitely worth getting even in EA, as long as you don't mind a few (minor) issues and hoping for a little more content. It's good already and it's only going to get better!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not a racing or rally fan, but this game, this is something else. There is something amazing here. I picked up Dirt Rally on a whim and I can’t seem to stop playing it.This is a hard as nails pure racing game, through and through. No storyline about how you’re a young upstart who’s going to rise up and challenge the king of the road, no brother murdered by rival street gangs to avenge, none of that stuff. This is a game where it’s just you, your metallic hunk of an overpowered vehicle, your hapless co-driver, and the winding, indifferent road. Drive your heart out.Despite more than ten hours in the game, I still don't know how to take hairpins well. Basically I'm still using the brake, close my eyes, turn into the corner, and Jesus take the wheel method but I barely just managed to finish the 1960s championship in first place after hundreds of restarts, and it was as satisfying as a difficult section of Dark Souls. In fact managing to pull off any track perfectly feels like beating one of the bosses in Dark Souls, it's a similar ""push/pull"" feeling where you're working to get yourself to that state where you're 100% in control. In Dark Souls if you get too greedy and try to go all out and attack the boss with everything you’ve got, most likely you’re going to get smashed to death immediately. Similarly in Dirt Rally, if you drive recklessly in an attempt to get the best time, that's a perfect recipe for inadvertently flinging yourself off the side of a cliff at high speeds. In Dark Souls if you are too passive the boss’s attacks will eventually wear you and your estus down, and in Dirt Rally if you drive too slow you won't place well in the leaderboard, so there is a fine balance in risk vs reward. This game ticks many of the same feelings for me as Dark Souls, which was surprisingly enjoyable, somewhat like a pseudo masochistic desire to “git gud.”I'm not a fan of the additional rallycross mode (with you and a bunch of other racers on a circular track), but thankfully the focus is on pure rally, and there are many real life locations/ tracks to drive in, although to be honest I wished there were a few more. In an effort to ""git gud"", I've started watching rally races on YouTube as well as reading up on real life driving maneuvers/techniques to improve my game, and anytime a video game pushes me to learn more about a certain discipline IRL is a good thing in my book. I mean, I still can’t pull any of them off reliably, but baby steps, right? The physics in this game are extremely well modeled, RWD, FWB, and 4WD all feel different in how they operate, which lends interesting choices as to which car to purchase and compete with, at least in the earlier races. The many road surfaces feel great and visceral to drive on, and the vehicle handling plus the subtle vibration in the controller really sells the feeling that you are on a gravel road, or an ice sheet, or just plain, smooth asphalt. The game’s environments are beautiful as well, and immersive as hell when you using one of the cockpit modes. I don’t have a VR headset, but trust me that this would be the first game that I would try if I was to ever get one.I'm playing with a Xbox 360 controller using manual sequential (including manual clutch control) with some ABS assistance and it's perfectly playable. Call me casual, that’s fine, but the game really has hit a sweet spot between letting casual players like me have fun with a stiff challenge and being a true rally simulation for those with wheels and pedals, all without being too difficult to get into as to be alienating.If you’re somebody who is into rally racing or just racing in general, I’m certain you already own this game. If you’re somebody who likes challenging experiences, but has no idea what’s a Scandinavian Flick is or what a cluster♥♥♥♥ the Group B cars were, I would recommend Dirt Rally wholeheartedly to you based purely on how satisfying the game is when you put some time into it. And honestly, you’re looking at a learning curve of only 3-4 hours before things start making sense, so don’t be scared away by that term, “Learning Curve.”Just remember, DON’T CUT!

												I was getting concerned about the lack of good VR content, this game has officially restored my faith. I played quite a bit on the non VR version and the improvement in my driving after switching to VR is substantial. I can anticipate turns much better and have an overall better feel for the driving dynamics of the vehicle. Oh, and this isn't a crappy VR port, it feels tailor made for the goggles. Went back to Project Cars VR, huge fan of 2D version btw, for a comparison. Dirt puts it to shame. Graphics settings remain extensive and I have them maxed on an MSI 1070 with oculus debug tool set to 1.5. Like butter after the 2 most recent Nvidia driver updates. It's relatively intense mentally, not motion sickness mind you, and I usually need to take a break after an hour or so. This is a good thing and reminds me of the adrenaline drain after going to a real track, although not quite that dramatic.i5 6600k16GB G.Skill DDR4 @ 3000MSI Krait Z170 mobo MSI Gamer X 1070 OC'dSamsung ssd 850 evo 500GBSharks w/ Freakin' Laser Beams			",33,10,2,6,17,1,18

								IT IS AWESOME!I really love Dirt Rally, especially now with the new FFB update, after a bit of tweaking it's a hell of a ride! Especially with the soft lock feature. Hairpins are very easy to handle now on all surfaces, excellent. Snow-tarmac track at night with Impreza=spectacular :) Very nice graphics, great sounds and now also great feeling of the rallying itself. I love RBR, I love Dirt series, but this is something else and very special. I'm really glad I joined to this great project. Even now for me it's almost perfect. And Pikes Peak (mixed surfase) is a nice challenge too. If you like rally, you cannot miss this. Runs nice, looks nice, drive nice, this is nice nice nice.... going back racing :)			",128,15,21,6,7,0,5

								What can i say about this game that hasn't already been said.. in my opinion its the best Rally simulator to be made in the last 16yrs, i have been gaming 30yrs this year, yes thats right im that old. and in all that time i have never played a Rally simulator as good as this, yes i know Richard Burns Rally is hailed as king of Rally games in some peoples eyes.. but Dirt Rally keeps you coming back for more, it,s not easy by any means, but if you put the time in and get good at it, it gives you a feeling of accomplishment, now i have played most racing simulators in my time and i can say there,s not many that give you that feeling.. i will say onething i know it can be played with a pad or keyboard but you really need a wheel to get the most out of this game, it,s just that a wheel gives you so much more immersion...

												Okay so this is Codemasters' best ever racing game. And that's high praise from someone who has played EVERY one of their entries since 2007 (Colin McRae Dirt). In fact, it's not even close. Dirt Rally is the definitive rally experience, and I anticipate I will spend 100s of hours playing it. It is a true testament to what can be achieved with meaningful community engagement: the 6+ months this game spent in Early Access helped Codemasters to fine tune the game to appease die-hard fans, and it shows. In short, it excels in almost every area: Graphics (aesthetics and optimization), Audio (omg), Physics, Car Designs, Difficulty. My only gripe is that for $60, there is a distinct lack of content - plenty of cars and rally championships, but rallycross and hillclimb seem to be an afterthought. But a lack of varied content cannot take away from this outstanding game that the community has been demanding for years. And most importantly, no more Travis Pastrana telling you how 'rad' and 'far-out' your last race was.			",189,50,16,16,36,5,36

												Now that this Rally SIM is out of Early Access I've deleted my old review and decided on a new review.  I've played over 300 hrs on this game which speaks volumns on how good this is. I've played this more than any other racing game. Why? Its so realistic. I actually feel I'm driving a real car.  The graphics and Physics are spot on. The Forcefeedback on a steering wheel is spot on.  All of the Rally stages are perfect offering a wide range of surfaces. PLus with Rally cross and the Hill climb race makes it a true all rounder. Something for everyone.  You never get bored as with the daily, weekly and monthly events it always gives you something to come back to each week. PLus with the PVP online gaming events which you play with fellow drivers on the Rally cross is spot on and offers a diferent aspect to this Rally Sim.  I've had this game from almost day one in the early access stage and have just seen this grow from strength to strength. Yes it had its ups and downs but with the Codies working very cloisely to the community we worked around all the niggles that occurred.  Is it worth buying? Yes sir it is one to have in your collection. It is hard to master and I recommend always to take your time and just aim to finish a stage.  This isnt your usual arcade racer where you are guaranteed to win every stage. This one makes you work for it.  I'm still only managing to reach 7th or 8th place in the masters league and I've played over 300 hrs.  But I keep coming back because of the challenges it presents me and for the realism. Theres nothing else out there like it in the modern age of rally sims.			",297,36,49,12,29,3,26

								Truly awesome!I don't know a super amount about rally, but I have played some really great rally games in the past, namely Rally Trophy and Rally Championships. But this... Dirt Rally... Has topped them all.If you, like me, had the misfortune of playing Dirt 1/2/3, you probably won't be expecting much from Dirt Rally initially, but if you're looking for a proper rally simulation with outstanding sound quality and the real feel of flying down a dirt road with mud and water soaking your car as you pray you don't hit the tree up ahead, then you won't be dissapointed.It's got it all:- Excellent Graphics- The best sound effects i've ever heard in a rally game- Just absolutely gorgeously modelled tracks, from dried out greek dirt roads, the snowy hills of Sweden right down to the muddy Welsh moorlands.- Large selection of cars that you actually want to drive! None of that random dirt buggy stuff from the previous Dirt games. Ford RS200, Ford Sierra, Peugeot 306, Mini classic, Lancia Delta Integrale and tons more.- Oh! And no terrible cutscenes with a pro-active nobody telling you that this is your caravan and that great things await... Codemasters have managed to go back to the nitty gritty roots at the core of Rally. Dirty, dangerous and hair raisingly exciting, and pack it all into a single game with a pretty low pricetag.--I use a G27 wheel/h-shifter to drive with, it's well supported, the FFB is great with only a little left to be desired on tarmac imo, and it's really responsive--Do I recommend this game? Let's put it this way. I would buy it again in a heartbeat. YES!9/10 - Fantastic! THANK YOU FOR SAVING PC RALLY, CODEMASTERS! :D			",247,17,34,23,50,2,52

								As a gravel driver I have been looking for a more sim based rallying game. Until now there has really only been one outdated (but good) game to play. Dirt Rally however is everything I wanted and more.LIKES: Great realism, the best sound in any racing game EVER!!, fantastic graphics, good tuning options, A REAL CHALLENGE of a game...not something you will master in 5 minutes ;)DISLIKES: None really, its a fantastic sim racer, with more and more features coming on board...see the timeline :)Some people may be expecting more of a DiRT3 (arcade) experience, this game is not like that, but a reality-based simulator. Be prepared to spend time driving the cars and understanding how the cars move, and what to adjust.Yes there is online content, in the form of daily/weekly/monthly race events where you compete against other drivers from around the world (but only on a time basis - there are no ghost cars just like real rallying!)I CANT WAIT FOR: RALLYCROSS!!!!!

												I come from a background of racing. I've raced everything from go karts to sprint cars, from dirt to asphalt. I've never driven a rally car and hope to one day do that, but the amount of feel you have in this game, is insane. The realism of your co pilot and their direction makes your mind wander into a real world painted by codemasters. I have had the most fun and the most challenges with this game. Getting frustrated is part of racing, always trying to improve is part of racing, and consistency is king. This game wraps all of those factors into a screen right in front of you and makes it feel REAL. I love this game, will continue to play this game. Will continue to get better. 10/10.

[LINUX] Absolutely one of, if not the best, game ported to Linux on Steam.Pros: Very realistic, challenging, not an arcade racer, plays well with the Steam ControllerCons: Needs high end rig. On Arch Linux (using linux-steam-integration for native libs avail in AUR]), i7-6820HK/GTX-1070/64GB DDR4 1080p I've averaged 87fps on benchmark. Others have reported anywhere from 20fps+ depending on hardware, so definitely read the forums to see what others have experienced on specific hardware/distroUPDATE It's the game you'll reach for like coffee in the morning. : ) Easy to pick up for a quick 10 minutes.Tips/Feedback - Read the guide if your performance is lacking. After installing my last kernel upgrade (4.10.1), reinstalling my Nvidia drivers (378.13) for cuda issues..., and realizing that 8xMSAA, which is above and beyond the default ""Ultra"" -> drop it to 4xMSAA, Average is now 105-110. I'm sure it would be higher on the native laptop screen, but let's just say I'm a realist and would rather spend my time playing the game than reconfiguring my 4k setup again.TLDR 10/10, Start with Ultra @ 4xMSAA and read the how-to for further performance updates. They also include the recommended drivers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Fantastic looking game and feeling, like no rally game ever before! :D So much fun and actually pretty realistic, but the Force Feedback sucks to be honest, impossible to drift a BMW for ex. but i'm sure the DEVS will fix it shortly. In the meantime there are tweaks/mods to make it feel better that you can download at your own risk. /using a T500rs steering wheel and TH8rs shifter.

												This may be my first review of a game on steam.....ever?  That said, I feel it absolutely necessary to chime in on what may possibly be the most ENJOYABLE racing experience i've ever had.  Im 31 and have played just about every single racing game ever made and past favorites include somewhat niche titles such as Project Gotham(Previous favorite) to the hardcore more popular titles such as Forza and Gran turismo.In a very simple sense, this is like Project Gotham Rally. Initially simple but near limitness challenge and opportunity for improvement.  A somewhat perfect balance of sim and arcade.  Its just ENJOYABLE.  I enjoy ever single race with the exception of most of the RWD cars(Yes I suck with them).  Some may claim it was designed as a pure sim but many elements such as the damage, wonky airtime antics, post jump landings, etc dont seem 100% authentic but its pretty obvious the game wouldnt be very enjoyable if you clipped a stone on your second turn and ripped the back half of your car off spreading parts all over the road essentially killing your run.  The game is certainly brutal enough and you can total your vehicle forcing a restart but you really have to beat the cars into the ground for them to become totalled as opposed to real life where something as simple as a small jump can reek havic on the car.  Jumps just feel way too smooth and I wish the cars ""bucked"" a bit more as they landed depending on your trajectory but its all good, its keeps the momentum going and the experience fast and frantic without constant unpredictable wipeouts.  One final comment I want to make is something that stands out to me in nearly every race.  The game does a FANTASTIC job simulating speed.  Something I think every racing developer tries to nail but almost always doesnt.  If my memory serves me correct this was my main issue with Forza and just circuit racing games in general.  Maybe it just has something to do with driving on wide open roads as opposed the narrow, natural, paths you will be driving on in a rally game.  Even on some of the games larger straight aways, Germany and Finland are my favs, you just get an immense sense of speed as your car runs through each gear nearly topping out before having to slam on the breaks full force at the end to nail that acute turn.  But even this, which is normally cause for disaster in most other games, just works better.  You can be barelling down, see your impending turn and slam on the breaks and actually stop.  Its amazing, no more you didnt break at just the right freaking time so now your gonna fly off into the sand pit.  I honestly dont think I will ever go back to traditional racing after this.  DiRT Rally has spoiled me in all the right ways and I have zero desire to play or try any other racing game in the forseeable future.  In the end, the game just puts a big smile on my face!  Something I have been longing for in a racing game for a long, long time.  If you even like racing games, do yourself a favor and just buy it.  BUY IT NOW.			",248,17,29,29,12,1,35

								This is what I've been waiting for 10-15 years. Pure rally without b0ll0cks. Narrow roads, wide smile. No unpredictable gameplay length, high thrill, perfect immersion, nice visuals, enchanting locations, solid sounds, simulation @ the sweet spot, just the right amount of car/team management. Enough options, all internal cameras one could ever ask for.No stress, no unhealthy addiction, ranking, levelling...no strings attached = happier gamer.

												Codemasters have finally delivered! A proper rally game, with great visuals and physics, but without any of that ""extreme"" show-off stuff that plagues the Dirt series for some time now. The car handling feels just right. You can easily play with keyboard or controller (which I prefer despite having a wheel), but wheel support and FFB is very good here. This has everything you might want in a rally game and if you like this kind of motorsport, this is a must have.There is only a few little things that could be better and that would make this game perfect in every way:- you cannot select your tires, they always are the right ones for the conditions- a rally school would be a very nice feature, especially that the game is quite challenging- the AI difficulty is a bit over the top - I may not be the fastest driver, but I consider myself pretty descent and I have not won a single stage or rally on any difficulty (rallycross is quite easy though)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Fantastic game so far! It really does push you to the limits and puts you in the helmet of a really rally driver. You'll find yourself wincing when getting to close to the edge of a cliff, clenching your butt when going over a blind jump and lifting your head up into corners trying to see more of the track on a 2D screen... Some key good points:- The cars feel great which each class having their own identity- Locations have good diversity and plenty of routes- Great variety of cars to race around with- Very well polished even when in Early Access- Awesome simple UI- Incredible sound design- Large monthly DLC packs coming for free!There is still a few tweaks that can be made to the FFB but I'm sure they will be coming soon but even how it currently is it is a total blast to play and I don't think I have had a racing game that has giving this amount of immersion and edge-of-your-seat racing in a long while.

								A complex and extremely replayable racing game focused on traditional stage rallies and timed hillclimb events.DiRT Rally ditches the energy drinks, stadium trucks, drift events and general ""American dudebro"" motif of DiRT 2 & 3, and focuses completely and carefully on stage rallies, car maintenance and crew management.  Gone is the arcade feel of the previous games; DiRT Rally offers complex handling and modeling, making vehicle choice and pre-race setup a major consideration that will affect every aspect of an upcoming event.  Graphics and sound are extremely well-realized, making shakedowns and races a deeply absorbing experience.While DiRT Rally has only been released into Early Access for a few days, it's already remarkable well-developed and refined, offering intense racing experiences in a variety of challenging locations.  The game is slated to be in Early Access development for the next 6-7 months, and it will only increase in depth and quality during that time.  Highly recommended for all racing simulation enthusiasts and rally fans!			",94,30,1,9,37,0,37

												Update 12-01-2017: Codemasters announced the PSVR version of Dirty Rally. We are still waiting for an official statement concerning Vive support and their seemingly very close business relationship to Oculus / Facebook. It's not that I don't want the game to run on the PSVR. Of course I want it. I am happy for all PSVR users. But let's be fair and bring it also to us VIVE gamers.A very good game, maybe the best Rally game since ages and the 3D vision support is impeccable. Unfortunately Codemaster did an exclusive deal with Oculus and ignores since months the Vive community that also want to play the game natively on their HMD.Coming a long way from consoles in the 90s I am so sick with exclusive deals and with platform wars, especially when it comes to such a blossom and innocent new technology like VR. Exclusive deals will kill VR!Therefore, I am giving this game a downvote, even that there is so much I love about the game. I am very much disappointed, since months I am writing here on the Forum for native Vive support. But until now, no Codemonster has the balls to tell us 1) that it is an exclusive deal and 2) if it will be time exclusive or not. Very disappointed. Man up Codemaster!Recommended for 2D.Recommended for 3D.Not recommended for the Vive.			",999,203,30,59,70,3,58

								Thank you based Codies for a proper rally game. It feels like a modern Richard Burns RallyPros:-Proper rally ""simulation"", as in you have multiple stages with damage carrying over and the ability to repair damage with mechanics, provided you have enough time-No rewind function-Tracks are beautifully made with various dips, camber variations, crests and aren't 3 lanes wide anymore-Sound is great and are immersive-Graphics are clean with no unnecessary bloom and the like-Physics are definitely a step in the right direction and feel realistic and believable, you can feel the load turn the steering wheel heavy as you slide horizontally (though I've never driven a car through a gravel forest going 120km/h so I'm not too sure how realistic it feels)-Adjustable car setup with nice depth-Music is reminiscent of the classic Colin McRae Rally games -Pacenotes are organic sounding and natural, with pitch variations, blending rapid corners perfectly and detailed cautions-No frills, no BS, just RALLYING.Cons:-FFB needs definite work, feels much too muddy-Tracks are too short. Average being around 4 or 5 minutes long. Would be nice to have longer stages to mix things up-While car setup has a nice depth to it, they're still set by sliders. I'd like an advanced option to fine tune things with proper terms (angle/degrees, kN/m, mm, etc etc), though this is just nitpicking from me-Though there's a FOV option, it's pretty much useless-Can't hide steering wheel or arms in cockpit view-Mediocre performance, average only about 25-30fps on medium settings at 1600x900 with a 270x			",104,6,9,13,8,2,6

												DIRT Rally is a game about discovery. About learning. About sweat. It's also about cars, and rallying, but it's more focused on yourself than any racing game I have ever played. Playing DIRT Rally drops you right inside the cockpit of a rally car, and demands of you to be as good as the real drivers in the real thing, because it's driving simulation is phenomenally close to the real thing. That's what makes it special. It's a non-stop race to learning the ropes, to learning to drive rally cars in different surfaces, to sweating on 10 minute specials where you need to shave 2 seconds, to discover what you are capable of when the odds are against you. It's the best off road racer of the last decade, and if you're even remotely interested in driving sims, cars, or rallying, you should buy it right now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There's something about getting those hairpins and those massive jumps just right that makes you feel like you've accomplised something. Not only that but it is unbelievably pretty. This game was definitely worth way more than what I payed for and I look forward for more content to be added to it. Kudos Codemasters.

												this is basically a pretty hardcore rally sim, it's not for the fainthearted and not for those who wants an easy to pickup racing game...rallying in this game is hard, prepare to restart a race a lot just to familiarize the stage as there is no arcade rewind mechanic...on the other hand, this game will award you with one of the most satisfiying driving feel in a game ever, driving really feel organic and brutal at the same time, something that games like pcars, assetto corsa, automobilista and the likes aren't capable to give you, because here it's you the driver, your car vs (mostly) the nature, not man made tarmac. That is what make the game feel so great, there are plenty of tarmac based racing games out there on any platform, but there is almost no pure rally game out there, especially not on this level of brilliance for the overall package.

								In one sentence: Rally game made right.In an analysis: This is the true successor to Colin MC'ray Dirt and any rally game before the DiRT series. It is rougthless, unforgiving, muddy, nerv-racking, rage inducing piece of awesomeness. You don't get any tutorial or some ♥♥♥***le that narates your every step like DiRT 3, it throws you in the pool without any warning and you will fight for your life and BY GOD you will fail without tomorrow and I mean it. You will crash, by god you will crash so many times that you will curse the time you bought it, but that's what is the BEST part of this game because you will try to get better. It doesn't have a difficulty setting, the difficulty comes with experience, because every car behavies completely different from the other and every stage have different effect on your driving. Your best chance of success comes from hearing your co-driver and your reaction time. I read of people bashing this game cause of ""the physics of the game is trash !!1"" or ""the updatez don't fix this or that"". WRONG ! Every update makes the game even better than before, and every car that's get added, it's a new challenge and you want to use it on every challenge again and again. The background audience are crap, but who cares ?! Will you buy this game for the generic audience or for the breathless setting you are driving ? Filland fills like Filland and Greece fills like Greece, no stage is the same even in the same country or even when you drive the same stage backwards. The car deteriorates even if you drive like a pro, you know why ? Because that's what happens in real life too, aggressive driving deteriorates the car faster and puts you first while cautious driving deteriorates the car slower but you loose time and standing in the champioships, LIKE IN REAL LIFE ! A rock in the road can either send you corrining of the road or damage your tires and make you loose time. Every decision matters. The car sounds are spot on. Don't try it with keyboard, it's impossible, try at least with a controller but as soon as you get the cash invest on a steering wheel with force feedback and possibly with a gearbox because you will need to make the gear changes yourself, because the game has a bad habit of putting the wrong gears on the most critical times.I can go on for much longer, but the bottom line is this. If you like REAL rally games, then you own yourself this game. If you are new to rally games, then start with this game, before you even touch any other rally game.End of story.

It also contains only rally oriented modes (Rally, RallyCross, HillClimb). No more boring buggies, or dakar from previous Dirt games. Only downside is the amount of content, but it will still last you for tens or hundreds (my case) hours if you aim to completely master the game and achieve first places on all stages.

 About DiRT RallyDiRT Rally is the most authentic and thrilling rally game made, road-tested over 80 million miles by the DiRT community. It perfectly captures that white knuckle feeling of racing on the edge as you hurtle along dangerous roads at breakneck speed, knowing that one crash could irreparably harm your stage time. DiRT Rally also includes officially licensed World Rallycross content, allowing you to experience the breathless, high-speed thrills of some of the world’s fastest off-road cars as you trade paint with other drivers at some of the series’ best-loved circuits, in both singleplayer and high-intensity multiplayer races. ~ Release Date: 7 Dec, 2015GraphicsGame looks fantastic. There's a few things that Codemasters should improve like the spectators. They kinda look ugly for a 2015 game. And there's a few visual bugs related to shadows but nothing too severe. Interiors are BEAUTIFUL, full of details and speaking about details, the game is full of them inside and outside the vehicles. The mud, the burning brakes at night...SoundAgain, fantastic job. Cars sound incredible, specially the group B. You can even hear the window rattle. Soundtrack is nice, nothing too fancy but does the job.GameplayNow, this is where the game proves that is not a DiRT4. Rally is closer to simulation than ever before. There's a few options to make the experience a lil close to arcade (ABS, TCS, stuff like that) but if you turn them all off the game feels pretty realistic. I can't say how close is to RBR but one thing is certain, this is completely different to DiRT or even CM.And they added a few features, like upgrades for the cars (Nothing too powerful to make that Mini the ultimate rally car) and staff management, where you choose the team, pay their salaries, fire them and ofc each one has different stats that affect for example, the amount of damage they can repair between stages.All in All DiRT Rally is a nice Rally Game :-)10/10 From Me Sweep ",122,14,2,7,7,0,7

								So, You think you was doing good in Dirt 3 and you can just go straight in this game? Wrong. Why? Read below.Let me say few things first. i am 30 year playerwho love racing games. I played Dirt 3 and i was with Codemasters from my young days playing CMR 2.First i was thinking ""oh another rally game with arcadish feeling, let me give it a shot and i will refind it if i don't like it"".Oh boy i was wrong.First game welcomes you explaining this is early acess game and your feedback is needed, what they say is true. Game is in early acess but you have feeling it is complete product. I have ASUS laptop with 6Gb of ram and AMD HD 8670M with 1 Gb, game runs without problems on 1366x768 on high details and it looks beautiful, no hickups, no crashes, alt-tabing is easy and so far i did not see single problem with it. Sound is good and loud, co-driver is loud enough so you can understand him without problems, also you are getting corner notifications on middle of the screen that are clear and perfectly readable.Now for driving feeling.I am playing this game on keyboard, standard arrow keys. It is perfectly playable but you will need to break a lot of sweat to finish stage. I am planingnow to get racing wheel just because of this game but that will not be so soon because i need to collect money and explain my wife (tough part). But yes it is perfectly playable on keyboard but if you want more realism and drive it on your racing wheel i am sure you will not be dissapointed. Cars have different driving models and you can feel Codemasters give their best all cars feel diferently and i can say they have great sucsess.Now for actual driving.You have setup for cars before every stage, you can adjust bunch of settings such as brake bias, gears, suspensions. Spend some time there so you can setup vehicle for your taste because default settings are ok and if you know what you doing you can tweak them even more for extra seconds.Do not expect you will sit in car and go 200+ Km/h doing sick drifts and tricks. No. Game is not that easy.You will have to sweat your palms a lot to keep car on road and moitor every corner, calculate every jump and listen your co-driver all the time. Game is not forgiving errors and even if you do fell off stage you can recover vehicle which will result in 10+ second penalty or more depending how badly you crashed.Damage is done realisticly, tires will pop, suspension will go off, water will boil and engine will cut out, your body will be crushed like coke can if you hit a tree or spin.You can fix your car in between stages, you have limited time for every part so you will need to think good about fixing priorities. For example you will be able to fix engine and gearbox but not body and exhaust so think good what you need and balance it acordingly.I can proudly say i am glad i bought this game and i have no doubt i will have a lot of fun playing it. If you are searching for brilliant rally that is realistic search no more, you found it. Even if you are rookie this is great game to spend money and time on.i just want to say one big Thank you to Codemasters for this game and i am hoping they will continue adding content to it.I will see you all online, on dirt. :)Have fun, God bless.Boris Radijacija			",89,14,12,12,10,0,8

												Before even trying to think to press the “buy button” you need to ask yourself some questions: 1- do you love Rally racing?2- do you like a challenge?3- (and the most important one) do you have a Racing Wheel?I got Dirt Rally a way back, tried to play it on my Xbox One Controller and I always fail miserably! I never bothered even to try with a keyboard, and I thought I wasted my money on a game I could not play, simply because it’s too damn hard!!Everything changed when I got myself a racing wheel (Logitech Driving Force GT) a bit old wheel but still one of the best! so I fired Dirt Rally up and surprise! I was driving way better, hell, I even ended up 4th in the first round of the career! Dirt Rally feels so realistic, especially with a wheel, don’t bother to play with a controller or a keyboard, (well only if you are pretty good) the graphics are amazing, the sounds from the car engine, to the dirt, to the snow, to the rain, but don’t get distracted by the sound of the dirt under your wheels, you have to pay attention to your co-pilot, because he is your road map!oh and VR is amazing with that game! I have a Deepoon E2 (which works as Oculus DK2) and VR in Dirt Rally is very immersive! so if you like Rally racing, you love a challenge and you own a racing wheel, Dirt Rally is a must for you!

								best iteration of dirt/colin mcrae everif your into realism this is the game for youas someone who has rallied through tight forests personaly i   can say that is is by far the most lifelike game i have yet come across.just hope they put in more cars say like the 2003-2005 wrx and evo  as these were rallys most influential cars in the early 2000'sif you love rally get this gamethe only gripes i have is when you get a flat i would love to see tyre changing added to the game, say a 2 minute penalty and some animation while on the side of the trackand rather than just restarting back on the track when you run off i would like to see an animation of the spectatiors pushing you back onto the road then this would truly be THE GREATEST SIMULATOR OF ALL TIMEDiRT Rally captures the essence of what makes rally unique – that sense of trying to remain in control of your emotions, as you hurtle along dangerous, undulating roads at breakneck speed, aiming to squeeze everything out of your car whilst knowing that one crash could irreparably harm your stage time. It’s the ultimate test of a driver’s skill, and it’s the ultimate in high risk, high reward gameplay.			",173,16,13,9,11,0,15

												I tend not to purchase games when they're in early access as I've had some bad experiences. Dirt Rally is far from one of those bad experiences! I bought the game when it was in 0.5 and already was very pleased with the game. Since then they've added the RallyCross and 2 more full stages in Germany and now Finland. With every update comes a huge amount of content and bugfixes and it is simply put a tremendous game. The sound is one of my favourites in any racing game i've played, the handling model is right up there as well. All in all I can't recommend this game enough for fans of rally of indeed driving games in general!!			",104,19,18,3,27,4,22

												If you are fan of Richard Burns Rally or just want the most authentic rally experience without leaving your home and spending your life savings, this is your best shot. There are no free lemons, you gotta learn things by yourself and the learning curve is very steep. You won't be winning much during your first hours, but when you start winning, it actually feels like you achieved something. Dirt Rally will offer great challenges to everyone, I guarantee it. If you ever feel that you are quite fast, hop online.			",37,10,11,5,9,0,2

												First off, I am a long time PC racing simmer, going back to the early Papyrus days with Indianapolis 500. These days I race with an Obutto Ozone cockpit, G27 wheel and pedals, and a Fanatec Clubsport Shifter SQ.Let me just say that Dirt Rally is a superb game and racing sim in most respects. If you have interest in rally racing (both modern rally and vintage/historic rally,) it's a safe bet that you will more than get your money's worth out of the game. So now to break it down a bit more:Pros:-Wide variety of cars, broken down into very interesting categories such as 60's FWD, 80's RWD, Group B 4WD, and so on.-Each car behaves uniquely, even among cars in the same classification-SUPERB sound design; close your eyes while watching a replay and you'll swear you're watching a Youtube clip of a real rally stage.-Five beautifully modelled countries to race in, including Greece, Monaco, Wales, Germany, Finland, and Sweden.-Fully modelled Pikes Peak, including before full paving (partial dirt road) and after full paving (all asphalt)-Rally cross tracks, with online multiplayer-Realistic handling and force feedback effects (the physics and FFB are not hardcore sim quality like iRacing or Assetto Corsa, but certainly lean FAR more towards sim more than arcade)-Time of day and weather settings for all tracks, which provide gameplay variation and challengeCons:-Needs more rally stages, because you'll start to recognize sections quite quickly as play each stage more and more-The rally cross and Pikes Peak stuff is neat, but feels tacked on (a bit of the old Dirt games, in a way)-The interface is clunky; although it's been improved greatly since the first Early Access release, it's still not intuitive and will take some getting used to-As good as the sounds are (best in class by a long shot, really) there are a lot of minor issues, such as silent turbos in all of the turbocharged cars, at least on my 5.1 systemThis is an all around fantastic game, and I can't say enough good things about how the developers have listened to customer feedback from the beginning. I'm very hopeful that they will create some DLC with more countries or stages to rally in, and more vehicles to enjoy.			",155,18,19,21,23,0,20

								I've been on the look for a legit racing simulator for quite some time and i think this game is it.  - Physics replicate road and tire feel very well and It is actually quite hard and challenging, not for those looking for arcade/relaxing style easy drive.- Driving the courses/cars requires proper concentration or you'll end up being losing time, smashed up, mental inconsistence, or disqualified for severe vehicular injury. - Drive as if you would in real life, loss of friction, bumps, road camber, etc. requires careful throttle, brake control, etc.. Learning curve is very high especially if not use to rally and can be a little frustrating but I personally would not want it any other way for a game like this. - Excellent environment providing all of it's elements including ice, rain, snow, dawn, night time racing with functional headlights and more. - No need to really go into further details, it is as close to Rallying as you can get without actually being in a rally. Even the co-drivers voice has a sense of urgency under fast technicals and can hear some shakiness in voice on uneven/bumpy terrain. Maybe it's my imagination as once you put your concentration into the game it gets intense, but voice for slower parts of the course does seem more calmly put.game 10/10 for an early access with well executed content so far.I do think the game can get a little more real to induce more awareness and caution i.e.) sometimes you can smack rocks and trees and keep going. /shrugMy game runs extremely fluid with minimal fps drop and if it does it'll not affect my experience. I have game on ULTRA.i5 quad 3.5GTX 970 Nvidia8gb RAMThis game has me considering even putting out for a logitech g27.. game is that good of a driver imo. I've been playing with Xbox One controller thus far and tuning it to run properly is very hard as a controller cannot beat the pedal travel and the stick cannot replicate a steering wheel at the slightest. (Often times you end up full lock either direction on the control stick, or I just don't have the finesse to finely move the stick minute amounts to deliver low steering angle...) I have played shortly on a wheel set up and I think it does this game the much needed justice over the controller and especially the keyboard. If this game does come out for console, I'm sure they'll have the game calibrated to easily accomodate controllers.I cannot comment on the multiplayer as I've yet to try it, also hoping for more cars, environments, and tuning options of course. I've also not checked either steam or their main forums but I hear from other reviews before I bought the game that developers are very much looking to bring the best rallying simulation possible and I hope they keep it as real as possible for future as well. This shows with their constant updates from a outside looker point of view.*Caution: this game may not appeal to ricers as you cannot - Slam the cars- Stretch the tires- Run -20 camber with the said abovebut you can and will scrape; as a bonus, possibly brake an oil pan =PCouple of tips:- DO NOT CUT, there are solid obstacles or big gaps that it's possible to destroy your car completely or severely injuring it for the remainder of the race. - Look ahead, if you see some major openings to set yourself up for speed do it			",75,1,2,7,3,0,2

Early Access Review
								(9/09/2015) - http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgchan/recommended/310560/Hello everyone,I will keep updating this review with new thoughts and incoming updates. First of all, I AM ALL TO THE PAIN SIM DRIVER! (I was so afraid to buy this game because of ARCADISH style of previous ones - FEAR NOT and buy now !) Few years of Richard Burns Rally (raw, rsrbr, rbr-world), iRacing, Live for Speed etc. I will write some more in free time - I have to rally some more now!THE GOOD:+ soft-lock is a great feauture~! (you don't have to set rotation of your wheel for each car, you put it on max and the game will do the rest, fixing it to a current driven car)+ Rally Cross mode is plenty of fun. The cars feel much better than the ones from rally mode, a bit too slippery though, it feels like driving on ice most of the time+ dashcam is way to go, forget the cockpit view if you strive for the maximum realism. It looks and feels amazing~! I just wish more cars would have shift-light and gear inf box located higher so we could see them in this view+ 306 Maxi + German special stages on tarmac are so much fun+ driving on a rim (without a tyre) is not fun :)+ with higher difficulty, the weather conditions get worse (night, snow, rain etc.) Unfortunately, only your visibility is affected... the handling stays the same...+ I can't get enough of how rain looks like... simply amazing+ WRC Ford Fiesta handles beautifully on Welsh stages!+ night + heavy rain = heaven!+ amazing lighting work; it looks so incredible when you are driving through shaded areas and the bright sun rays are falling into your cockpit+ if you hold the handbrake with RWD cars without clutch you can stall them, yea!+ your gears can pop out, if you have damaged gearbox!!!+ daily, weekly and monthly online events where you can't restart! YEA!!!+ sounds!+ graphics (about which, I really don't care - but it looks amazing)+ overall pleasure from rallying!+ I expected much worse+ water-splash is so sick!!!+ car repairs+ sense of speed+ it is already much better than RBR!!! Can you believe it!? No?! Me too! BUT IT IS - trust me!+ I can't stop rallying already and I am driving the slowest car~! + great animations of cockpit, you can see your feet working on gas, brake and clutch pedals+ logitech g27 @ 540* works like a charm!+ SS (special stages) look amazing!THE BAD:- NOT EVEN CLOSE TO RICHARD BURN'S RALLY! ARCADY AS F*CK... It is far far away from being a simulator... It is plenty of fun but I don't think it will even come close to RBR...- zero respect for the speed... you can drive 100km/h, hit a tree and still drive without any consequence... PATHETIC!- [PARTIALLY FIXED - all surfaces feel weird] during the rain, you can't tell the difference between wet and dry surface... ARCADE BS!- zero respect for Monte Carlo stages... too much grip... too easy... ARCADE BS!- you can barely slide the car unless you use a handbrake...- [FIXED - clutch override option added] there is no MANUAL SEQUENTIAL GEARBOX + MANUAL CLUTCH... which is real WRC car setup- the power of WRC MINI on tarmac is some kind of a bad joke...- you start rolling after a great crash and the game resets you on the road... stop with this arcade BS!- terrible ARCADE DAMAGE SYSTEM! You can literally bounce back from walls... - bring the deadly one from RBR!!! No mercy for arcade noobs ! - when you fell out of a road, it takes one button to recover... WTF!? It should be at least 30sec of penalty!THE UGLY:~ [PARTIALLY FIXED... still not fair]=[all cars except for WRC have now delay when using sequential gearbox, very good idea] people driving with full manual setups and zero assists ( h-pattern + manual clutch = it is so much HARDER ) should not be thrown into bag with other drivers using different easier setups.~ the cars slow down way too fast when you are not accelerating!~ not enough stages in my opinion. Even though the location are very nice, they get boring rather quickly...~ [PARTIALLY FIXED... still feels slugish]=[latest ffb patch made it so detailed, I don't know if I should rally or admire how nice it is! Now you read the car behaviour instead of fighting with a wheel. Feels amazing! The car is ALIVE!!!] FFB feels like I am driving every car without a power steering, I constantly have to fight with my wheel... after 13h+ of rallying it is so bloody annoying!~ [FIXED]=[latest ffb patch made it so detailed, I don't know if I should rally or admire how nice it is! Now you read the car behaviour instead of fighting with a wheel. Feels amazing! The car is ALIVE!!!] definitely needs more details in handling (although some icy parts of the road were amazing and they have sent me straight into a wall)~ how can you not let us change different tyres for different surfaces!? It is rally FFS!~ [FIXED]=[latest ffb patch made it so detailed, I don't know if I should rally or admire how nice it is! Now you read the car behaviour instead of fighting with a wheel. Feels amazing! The car is ALIVE!!!] FFB needs to be much more detailed, it feels very sluggish at the moment - still nice though~ [PARTIALLY FIXED... the gears still pop out randomly]=[they pop out now only when gearbox is damaged or when you have not pressed clutch all the way down during a gear change] gears from my H-pattern pop out from time to time; not sure if bug or simulator thingy* After more than 63 hrs on record of rallying in Dirt Rally, I have found myself missing the real professional sim... and started racing in iRacing again, even though I do not like track racing. This game is really good, and plenty of fun, but it is as close of being a simulator as Counter-Strike is... It will never be a sim, everyone with a little piece of working brain, can see where this is heading... Do I still have a hope for it to become one? No, not anymore. This is nothing more but a good arcade rally game. If they will keep advertising this as a sim, I will change my review drastically, they do not deserve this word SIMULATOR, describing this title!** After 67 hrs on record, I am too irritated with stiff handling and almost none existent weight balance to continue... As I said before, it is only an arcade game and they have no idea about simulations... I want to punch them in the face for talking about simulating a drop in power, on high elevated special stages, when they let you hit a wall at the maximum speed without any consequence... This is not the biggest problem though, you are not taking pleasure from hitting walls, right? Rally is all about the skilfull handling of the car, the way you do it, you balance the weight of the car. Unfortunately, you can't feel it, in this game at all. The physics feel off, cars are too stiff, unresponsive, underpowered and god knows what else... Even the sound of the cars became dull and boring after a while... Those are rally cars god damn it! Let them sound like monsters!Now, I can clearly say that RBR is still no. 1, such a shame...EDIT: After coming back from a month or so break, game feels amazing again. The RallyCross is fun and the cars actually feel like the WRC should have... It is a great game... I am just angry because I know it can be the best rally simulator ever created, I just hate the idea that they are trying to please both; arcade turds and sim freaks like myself... Unfortunately because of this, the games falls somewhere in between... Too hard for total arcade noobs, and too arcady for a real simulator... What a shame...More incoming soon!Thanks for reading--tgchan.com ",33,0,3,7,3,0,3

								The mechanics in this game feel excellent, it runs smoothly, and it feels like an accurate simulation of actual driving.I play full manual with H-shifter & clutch on a Logitech G27 wheel (which the game picked up and configured the settings for perfectly) and the force feedback and wheel return is pretty much perfect. They seem to be adding new content fairly regularly, all of which so far has been of a very high quality.It's early access so there's a couple of small bugs here and there as of writing this review which I'm sure will get fixed, but nothing major. Alt tabbing the game means it switches to windowed mode which is annoying, and starting without launch control sometimes results in a jumped start even though I'm in neutral with the handbrake on. Otherwise I haven't noticed any other bugs and it hasn't crashed once.This is the best realistic driving game around right now, and one of the only games I would recommend buying in early access. They are doing early access right.			",135,12,6,6,4,0,8

												This game is punishing, and I adore it. Nothing like any of the previous DiRT titles where you can just mash down the gas and steer for dear life although fun not realistic.  I found out very quick that you have to finely tune your vehicle and finesse it through every track, alot of skill to build in this game. At the time of this review I'm only sitting at around 15hrs or so but from what I can see there are a lot of tracks to race on and vehicles to unlock or should I say purchase.  Again it's nothing like any of the previous DiRT titles, it's an actual simulation now instead of an arcade game.  It's punishing, I'll say it again..IT'S PUNISHING. Now you get a crew chief and get to hire and upgrade mechanics, in between stages you can repair your car.  The graphics are beautiful and the sound is great.  To be honest I was shocked when I first started playing, I couldn't do anything or keep my car on the road because I was so used to how the old DiRT titles played.  I stepped back took a deep breath and began to start respecting the game for what it had evolved into, an effing simulation.  Once I learned I had to tweak my car settings for every single track and gave the game respect I started picking it up and learning to drive again.  In the old DiRT series you really didn't have to make serious adjustments for most tracks anyways, in this game you really need to...or you will fail.  Also I read some other reviews about people playing with a M&K..not going to happen...you need a controller by default.  This game actually makes me want to go out and invest into a wheel and pedals, I have never ever considered that until now.  I'm about to take my nerd level up a notch. I played DiRT 2 the most even after DiRT 3 was released since I was so ashamed of DiRT 3 and all of the Gymkhana whatever stuff they forced into a series of races.  Now that we are back to DiRT lets keep it here please, this game has redeemed the series and for that I am truly grateful.  The game just feels and looks and sounds so good, and there are a lot more customizable options now to your cars, I don't want to spoil it but you have to ""unlock"" the good customization options. You are going to need them, the more you drive a car the more your team becomes familiar and the more unlocks for your customization abilities for that particular car you are granted.  The nice thing is all of the liveries are already unlocked giving you a little bit of flavor right off the bat, but the new customization replaces you being able to unlock paint jobs. The game feels balanced, the physics are very punishing and realistic and you will grow to respect the track and your car very quickly.  I have not found a track I dislike yet, they are modeled so well and the physics of each track are so amazing and..whats the word...brutal.  One other thing about the DiRT series I always loved was the replays, and they are just as amazing now as they always were.  There is no more rewind your mistakes, now its ""reset"" your car with a time penalty unless you can drive out of your mistake quicker than resetting your car.  You can resart the race but you will lose a specific amount of credits that are given to you each race as a reward for not using the restart feature. Eventually using the restart enough times in one race will render you with zero bonus credits but they will not affect your original credits you will earn for finishing the race.  Very well done on Codemasters part, they are very balanced on punishing you as a driver without robbing you. ;) They did a good job with this game this time around folks, you can plunge into career mode ""like me"" or go test drive any car on any track on custom championship.  In career mode they don't necessarily throttle you to go a certain way, it's basically up to you and how you spend your hard earned credits towards vehicles in order to access certain tracks and races.  Codemasters deserve a nice little pat on the back, job well done. If you were or are a rally or DiRT fan and want to kick it up a notch or two buy this game, you won't regret it.  It's punishing and beautiful and lots and lots of replay value.			",33,4,2,2,3,0,1

												I bought an old Microsoft Sidewinder Force 2 USB directional force feedback joystick used on eBay after playing Dirt 3 and loving the game, but feeling like the controls were way too similar to old console games from the 90s back before analog sticks came around.Back in the late 90s, I started a computer store and I used to sell the Logitech brand of directional force feedback wheels and sticks.  Logitech had the best hardware ever brought to the consumer market when it came to the sticks and the cables and the motors.  It made a decent racing/flying game an absolutely riviting experience.  To give an idea of why directional force feedback matters, try getting into a go-kart at a local kart racing place.  Just rent a kart and go around the track.  That wheel will fight you around every turn, and it makes the driver/road connection a real wrestling match.  This is also what it is like racing a full sized vehicle off road, on gravel, or on dirt.  When you push a vehicle to the limits of traction and beyond, that wheel becomes quite a bear to content with but it also gives you feedback about what the vehicle is doing that is less obvious otherwise.So feedback like this makes a racing experience more real.  Cool.  In addition, the tiny little sticks that most consoles use (like the 360 controller) don't have the fine degree of control that something like racing needs.  The tiny sticks are great when it comes to analog direction, but not so great when it comes to distance between center and fully pressed in a given direction.  This isn't important for all games, but the shortcoming becomes obvious in situations like racing.I play games sitting on the couch, with a projector screen in my living room connected to my PC.  This means a wheel and pedals would be quite cumbersome, because I have no desk to clamp such a monster to.  My experience with wheels is that they are often less precise than a large joystick, and certainly less precise than an actual hydraulic/cable driven steering wheel from a car or kart.All this is why I bought this joystick.  I bought such an old one because they don't make large, directional force feedback analog sticks like this anymore as near as I can tell, the market trends just aren't pushing them.  This old stick requires no drivers in Windows 7 x64, so it really is plug and play.  The old Logitech stick I used to own/sell is technically superior, but it isn't compatible with newer flavors of Windows so it isn't an option anymore.As to the experience, I actually bought Dirt Rally after having some difficulty setting it up with Dirt 3, seeing that Dirt Rally just came out, and reading an interview that says they added analog stick support to the default controller profiles set up for Dirt Rally.  I did get joystick support and directional feedback working with Dirt 3, but it just feels wrong, and it needs to be tuned in some manner because it will literlally throw me off the road even when I have the force dialed back to a mere 10% in the game.  The force reduction doesn't seem to work and the motors are strong enough to literally muscle you off the road, if the game/stick aren't tuned or tunable to work well together.I did have to go in and set the stick and the throttle (built into the stick) as needed so Dirt Rally knew what to do with it but once I did, the motors in the stick snapped to life and the stick was suddenly ready to go (it sits in a relaxed state with the stick lounging to the side until a game talks to it).I jumped into the first track, with the first car.  WOW!  Not only did it bring back memories of playing on my old analog stick and driving racing games like Need for Speed or Star Wars Pod Racing, even better, it reminded me of getting behind the wheel of an actual vehicle and carefully driving around mountain roads as I get a feel for how far I can safely push the vehicle.  I wasn't fast.  I wasn't a speed demon.  It felt like driving a real vehicle.  It wasn't relaxing, it was edge of your seat stuff!  I nearly felt like I had left my house, and had an adventure as I get a feel for gravel roads, as the feedback goes from pushing against you gently, to pushing harder, to going slack when you slingshot past a spot and know if your angle of entry wasn't good you are in trouble because the steering went slack due to a sudden and temporary complete lack of traction.This game isn't flashy.It isn't about eye candy.Tracks take longer, like real driving does.This is the game that gets you into racing.This is the game that gets you into racing games.This game is the reason you get better controllers.Kudos, and thanks for getting me back into racing, and giving me a reason to get into force feedback that is more than mere rumbles!

								I got a problem since I got this DiRT Rally...  I can't stop playing! hahahahI never drive a rally sim before, just regular race sims...  but I saw a lot of RBR and others, I want to get some to try, but except for RBR the reviews are not so good.Then this game came on steam, I saw some postive reviews, and decided to get it, and I don't regret!It's amazing, very funny, challenging, addictive!The technics to drive a rally car are some different. I'm liking to practice and get a bit better now since my first stages, but I still have  a lot to learn. It's very cool!One positive aspect is it seems Codemasters are listen the public, the foruns are crowded and the devs are open to feedbacks. The game is in early access now, but already playable, and we hope its getting even better over the time.If you like race sims, and want to race rally way, give it a try, good chances you'll like it.

								I bought this on prerelease with a little concern given how hit or miss codemasters can be (Dirt Showdown anyone?) and didn't want a racing game aimed at the console crowd where a gamepad plays better than a wheel after all the assists are added. This game amazes with great physics, beautiful graphics, and a challenging set of race stages. It might be too sim-like and complicated for children with the extensive car set-ups and difficult runs, but the cars drive so realistically with a wheel (g27 here) it is incredibly immersive and provides a compelling racing experience. The cons are that it is still pre-release at this time and while the online challenges provide a sort of multiplayer, it still doesn't have true multiplayer races which I will be disappointed if they don't add eventually. And I'll be annoyed if this is all you get and the additional promised content will be DLC that you have to purchase after the ""official"" release of the game. Nevertheless, for the prerelease cost it is an awesome game that is worth buying if you like driving games with realistic physics and great graphics. My feeling is that the work Codemasters put into the physics paid off and they have a winner in this genre.			",52,2,21,5,1,0,0

If you like rallying, driving or a challenge, buy DiRT Rally.If you've ever wondered how rally drivers control their cars in the amazing way in which they do, well DiRT Rally will give you some idea.Other track based racing sims I have are very good, but for me DiRT Rally provides the best overall driving experience.  The cars feel alive!    Spend a bit of time getting it to feel right for you and do a little research about ffb settings and mods.Don't expect to jump in a car and to be quick immediately.  This is a sim.  It will take time to learn and master it, but you will have fun while you are doing so.  With over 280 hours in DiRT Rally I am still learning, and still getting quicker!Finally DRIVE SLOWER TO GO FASTER  You will have heard this before.  It sounds silly, but its true.  Don't drive on the limit and on the edge of crashing at every bend and you will be amazed at your stage times.  The WRC drivers talk about ""getting into a rhythm.""  When you get into that rhythm you will understand what they mean.			",0,0,5,0,1,0,0

								It's good, feels updated, give you goosebumps... What more could you want if you like rally? (the compleated game no doubt) My only problem with this game is its still plagued with Codemaster things mainly with the car modeling, brakes that glow red hot for only a second, damage from Dirt Showdown days. Not very new or fresh.edit: The tracks need much more work, the roads are pointy and blotchy. Not very natural, but this is early work. I'm starting to think Dirt Rally isn't new, the car modeling annoys me far too much. Please give the cars some soul, some mass, better visual physics, nerd stuff like traction blobs and brake temp. It currently feels fake :/edit2:The water effects is fantastic, tracks are coming on well yet the skybox is a little ugly. Lost my left back tier on a new finnish stage, sparks constantly. Another rant about car realisum wouldnt help this review but with Project Cars 2 looking as if it may introduce rally CM needs to pick up the pace if they want to keep the crown of best PC rally game.Still, the game gets my heart pounding. Darting around corners then shooting off into intense speeds over rough roads, if you do that well for most of the stage! gotta love it!			",75,11,15,7,19,0,5

												I love how this game just popped out of nowhere when people were least expecting it. DiRT Rally is the most authentic rally racing game we've had in a while. It surely has more in common with the older Colin McRae games rather than the festival themed DiRT 2 or the gymkhana simulator DiRT 3.Everyone calls it the Dark Souls of racing games and rightfully so. The game can be unforgiving at times. Car handling feels quite realistic and stages are narrower this time around. You'll make mistakes, you'll crash and crash a lot. But that feeling when you finally nail a corner or beat a stage on your first try is just so damn satisfying.Graphics are splendid and so are the sounds, the weather effects look pretty good and everything feels very immersive. All in all, I really enjoyed this game and will be playing it for quite some time. If you're so much of a racing fan and still haven't played it yet, kill yourself.

I still do. Fail, that is. Yet I keep playing - and improving. Dirt Rally is perhaps the most challenging and rewarding car game I have ever played (and the list that started with Sega Rally 2 has grown quite long). It is fast-paced and unforgiving.In the career mode you have the added complexity of managing your crew, which adds both an interesting tactical flavour as well as a sorely needed input _other_ than your driving skills. This pleases some and annoys some. But the feature is solid.You get a ton of great tracks, a heap of great cars, and hours of good fun. What more do you want?			",81,17,5,13,11,0,5

								Me, as a amateur co-driver and rally enthusiast find this game no doubt the next gen rally simulator. Of course its still WIP and raw, but i see great potential. It's really hard to go fast, and when you go, mistakes are easy to come, but i enjoy the feeling when you push 101% in the woods of UK for 10 stages in a row, just to win rally by matter of seconds. Of course there are some flaws, like when hiting a snow bank in Monte Carlo rally, then it feels like hiting concrete fall. There are also some pacenotes call out and corner speed mistakes, but hey, even in real life co-drivers use to make these mistakes. You guys from Dirt Rally development crew, keep up the good work and set the next benchmark for driving simulators!			",1,0,2,0,0,0,0

 Welcome to the Dark Rally Souls  If you played the rally games of the 90´s you´ll recognise the spirit of that one, if not, basically it is: harsh, severe and a didactic experience about an simulation rally game. Seems that codemaster has found the way back to the future and made the best game about simulation. There are a lot of cars and tiers so the game has a good duration, now I´ve played 7 hours and just passed to the second ""tier"". The difficulty curve it is well escalted and you´ll pass across the different categories learning the differences between them.  Graphics : are simply the bests in this kind of games. Control : better if you have a gamepad and even better a pc steering wheel, never keyboard. Gameplay : is about maximum concentration, penalizing fool errors but awarding the regularity.  Good multiplayer , apart from the trolls. I do not reccomend if: you give up at the first sign of struggle or you don´t really like this kind of games.			",76,26,1,21,16,1,33

												I was never a big fan of racing games. Back in the day I loved Burnout 3 but it wasn't until Burnout Paradise when I really started loving racing games. After that, it took me years to get back into racing games. GRID 2 and Dirt 3 made me love the genre but both of those are really arcade. Not long after beating Dirt 3 I bought Dirt Rally.Most racing games trick you into thinking that you: 1) Can drive a car in the game really really well and 2) you're actually doing well in it. Dirt Rally does neither of those things. You can immediately tell when you're doing well and when you're not. The feeling of road is insane and will surprise people who aren't used to simulators (and even those who play games like Gran Turismo that are closer to simulation than most racing/rally games out there).In short, the game feels really good. I get instant feedback from doing well. It's so different from most other games I've played. Going back to other racing or rally games might be hard after Dirt Rally.The only real criticism I have is about the variety of tracks. Six events with 12 different stages per event is great and will take you quite a while to master but they totally could have released more events as a DLC and I would have bought that. I still recommend this game very much and I can say it's the best game I found during 2016.			",346,47,25,55,22,2,48

								Well I'm gonna have to relearn how to rally because D3 and DR are two totally different monkeys. Dirt 3 was about a collection of cars you had all the access in the world to, and increasing driver level unlocked new cars. DR took the classic route of ""if you want it, you gotta earn it!"" buy unlocking them with in game currency earned from races. But this game is so far beyond just that simple principal of drive>earn>buy. You have to hire a pit crew who maintain and tune your ride, pay for repairs, keep the crew happy, it gives an authentic feel of running a rally team outside of ""this is my car, there are many like it..."". And winning makes more money yes, but winning takes REAL work! The cars in this game handle nothing like they did in D3, I've driven my poopy personal IRL car down a dirt road and I have to be just as careful in this game as driving IRL. Crashes ruin your runs, and you get no rewind system. The ONLY assist in this game is your co-pilot, and you have to focus on the road, and what he's feeding you and misinterpreting what he says or not even listening can lead to your car getting wrecked. And the damage system in this game is brutal! I lost a tire mid-race and had to either chug on without it, or stop, and add a few minutes to my stage time replacing it. YES. YOU REPAIR YOUR CAR MID STAGE. And this eats time, which affects your position, which affects your earnings. This game will teach you a whole new respect for the rally world, and that's not a bad thing.If Collin McRae were still here, he would own a hundred copies of this game and he would be so proud of the legacy he left the gaming world.

												Best Rally game in years and in my opinion best Dirt game since the first one. Traction feels perfect, graphics are amazing, real time weather is awesome, the simulation of actual Rally racing compaired to Dirt 2/3 is much more accurate, and its actually difficult to win a championship instead of just handing it to you. I will be sure to put much more time into the game here soon with the inclusion of RallyX and HillClimb. Glad to see CodeMasters go back to their racing roots and show that they can still make amazing games. If you are on the fence about buying the game, just get it. Its a 10/10 Rally racing game all day long.			",362,61,20,41,40,6,48

								YES. Buy it. Not only do i recommend this Game but also i suggest buying a decent steering wheel.I just made my own raceseat and fittet it with a G27 Wheel and it's amazing. Racing for 3 hours and i am physically exhausted.If you love Rally / Rally-Games AND you can race a car without constant full throttle you will get your moneys worth here.This means, as this game (at least imo) counts as a simulation, you have to treat it like one. If you get off the track hard, you fail the stage, or at least get a recovery penalty so big, you consider the run failed just aswell.You will restart your races a lot in the beginning and i even suggest this so you can learn the game/cars. Later on, when you did, you shouldn't need to restart. Just accept the outcome.I really recomend a steering wheel of some sort or at least a controller with feathering triggers (like the xbox pad). PS: Ditches love cars. Give that ditch a car.			",85,11,10,1,11,1,4

												5 reasons why you should get DiRT Rally, now!5. You would feel like a rally driver. Suggest to turn up your air conditioning when driving in snow in order to have the maximum effect.4. It is realistic and beautiful. I turn off all the assist and auto-gearbox, just like in F1. Except, this is more fun than F1 games. Also getting rewarded in-game for playing it the hard way. Restart is discouraged. Basically just move forward after a big mistake, like real racing.3. It is mind boggling that the same company that made that crappy F1 game (OK not all iterations are crappy) is the one that made this brilliant racing game. Perhaps what people say about geniuses are true. It is a matter of hits and misses.2. I play with PS3 controller (in PC and it's great). I don't race well. It can be hard. But I get to enjoy the journey and experience. Woohoo!1. I am more grateful to what I have in life, more thankful having those who are around me. After seeing a few near-death experience here and there (man, those cliffs), I see life differently.What about cons and suggestions? Here are two.A) I need a female co-pilot. I mean, if I am to hear a voice yelling to my head all the time, I would prefer a female voice.B) Why is there no Singapore flag :( Fortunately I was born in Hong Kong. At least that is representated in the game.			",28,14,5,5,9,0,9

												After nearly 100 hours in, I figured it was time to throw my two cents into the bucket for DiRT Rally.  The good:-Driving in DiRT Rally does what no other DiRT game has been able to accomplish:  make you feel like you're about to have a MASSIVE accident.  The stages are all real, and some quick searches on the internet will show you that the tree you just crashed into does actually exist, and the rock that sent you for a wild cartwheel has probably claimed a few egos as well.  While DiRT 3 had some of the best multiplayer modes to come out of the series, DiRT Rally fills the gap that has always existed:  Rally.  Not since the days of Richard Burns Rally has a game been able to make me think ""I'm about to destroy this car"" yet find a way to make me keep my foot down.  -The visuals for this game are part of what gives you the feeling of excitement.  To me, graphics mean nothing in terms of how good a game is, but small things placed along rally stages such as little bushes, rocks, ditches, and even the high-density forests really do produce an exhilarating feeling as you roar through the stages.The bad:-The first, and probably the most jarring, thing that people notice is the lack of content.  Yes, there are (as of now) six different Rallies: Wales, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Monte Carlo, and Greece, however each rally is only two long stages of 15km+, with other stages consisting of half-runs through those stages.  One long stage is run in two directions, then each half is run in either direction, producing 6 stages for each long stage, thus 12 stages possible for each Rally. Fantastic, at first, and even goes so far as being challenging you to go faster as you learn the stages.  However, after a while the stages just become repetitive, and it's no longer new challenges.  You're either fast through the stage or you aren't, and the game begins to lose its luster.  The same goes for the other two modes:  Rallycross and Hillclimb.  So far, only three Rallycross tracks exist, with multiple layouts for each, while Hillclimb only has Pikes Peak, and that can be split into minor sections to add some substance to a rather thin environment. -There are a lot of cars, especially for a Rally game.  However, eagle-eyed players will be quick to note that specific cars will always outrun other cars, regardless of the situation.  For instance, the DiRT Rally forums are quick to point out that the Ford Fiesta is nearly impossible to beat on the Lydden Hill RX, the Peugeot is the king of Sweden's RX, and Norway's is a toss between the two.  As a result, RX multiplayer matches are full of Fords and Peugeots, with the other cars getting little love.  It also seems that there's no interest in addressing the issue.-Small bugs run rampant, and can ruin the game for some.  One major bug is the ""exhaust"" bug, which can turn a broken, worn-out wreck into a rocket ship.  Another, a little-known mod that may be correcting the variable surface built into the game, providing optimal conditions to those who use it, while others may be left with a worn-out and slick stage.  Currently, there is a popular topic on the forums about whether or not to completely wipe and reset the leaderboards because of it.-More issues, such as dodgy pace notes, fragile tires, shortcuts in the RX tracks, and a possible AI time bug exist, yet don't seem to be getting addressed.Conclusion:If you're a major rally nerd like I am, you'll love the feel this game provides.  Eventually though, everyone will inevitably grow weary of running the same stages over and over through Career mode.  Luckily there are Daily, Weekly, and Monthly modes to compete against the world, and see how you stack up against the human opponents.  A fantastic feature, but without pacing yourself, you could be left with nothing to do for a good portion of the week.  Despite that, I still love the game and play it almost every day, but I always wind up feeling disappointed and wishing there was that little extra something to keep me hooked.			",41,5,8,6,12,1,7

												Edit: FULL RELEASE (short 'n' sweet review).Utterly brilliant package, can't fault it really. My below EA impressions summarise the feel and flow of the game well enough so I don't want to repeat myself.Really impressed with the sheer amount of content for the price too, lots of different cars and locations on offer. Codies back at their absolute best!10/10, cracking game. Best virtual driving experience I've had in years.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------FIRST IMPRESSIONS:Disclaimer... I would hardly call myself an expert but I've been driving things fast since I could reach a steering wheel. Mostly karts, with the odd single-seater and tin-top hoon.+Handling: This thing is hard to master, and I ♥♥♥♥ing love it. The handbrake is my new best friend. I've genuinely not had this much fun with virtual driving in a long time, it's just so involving and physical. It's easy to get going at a somewhat competent pace, but to effectively carry speed you need to go full Finland. Pretty much the closest I've personally felt a game has come to a true driving 'experience' anyway.+Presentation: Slick as ♥♥♥♥, functional, tidy. Does what you want it to fast, and it's very easy to navigate. I love the Colin McRae 2.0-style car outlines, and the doodle pace note icons. It feels like a true-to-heart, wonderfully British rally experience. Awesome stuff.+Stages: Perfect in length, and there's already enough variety in there to keep me busy for a while. They're just long and different enough to keep me on my toes, but not so much that I can't pick it up and start zoning out from pace notes after a few attempts. I hate being overly attentive to them anyway.+Cars: I was surprised by the decent selection we have to kick off with considering the price, good stuff. Seems like a no-messing attempt to get the best rally vehicles possible so that's fine by me. I like how it's split into decades too, nice sense of progression (not just with age but speed!).+Sound/Graphics: I've seen a lot of praise for the former but honestly, both of these seem a minor at best improvement over the stellar Dirt 3. Not a bad thing, I've just not been blown away visually as yet. It's nice and clean though, does what it needs to do. I like the co-driver voice, sounds like a top bloke.ISSUES SO FAR:- FFB can feel a little muted at times.- DFGT wheel seems to not be recognised every now and again, and the resultant pause messes with the steering lock / overall FFB feel. Restarting sorts it.- All audio drops out if I try to play with the 60's Lancia. No idea why.OVERALL:Whether you're an old-school Codies fan or mildly interested in the rally genre, you owe it to yourself to give this a shot. Seriously, expecially for the price, it's ♥♥♥♥ing good.			",126,8,27,10,9,1,13

												In one word: 'Dirt!'10/10 Best Rally simulation ever built! Would rip wheels from Mini Cooper with 12km of stage left again!!!This game truly represents a back to basics hardcore experience that places you in the front seat and incontrol of a rally team; where you take this team is entirely left to you from car purchases, to upgrades, the engineers performing this upgrades, graphs galore and other slight car attenuations to match the race car to your needs!This game brings racing simulation for the off road motorsports fan into a new generation, its doesn't require small crowd shiny things such as short tracks, big name narration or more recent additions such as gymkhana and drift... Why? Because all you need is some DiRT (And Ice, Snow, mirror deep Mud to name a few) to Rally on, at the edge of your seat for a white knuckle expereince attempting to hold your car onto the track... so what if 3 of its 4 tires are down and flat, with only 1 tire still up... it doesn't matter as it's just bounced off with your wheel down the embankment! (Who knew you could rip the wheels of a Mini Cooper) The game challenges you to rethink the tactics we've grown used to and that is done so simply its beautiful and it will leave you hanging for more after some short stage recovery. The stages are incredibly intense!This game changes what you know, what we know about Rally games and challenges you to push past its clasp of simulation as it removes the best DiRT Rally games into arcade bins as it creates new standards.Great physics, awesome sound effects, wicked cockpit simulations it's as real as you get and the best bit... No micro transactions... once you buy this game its yours, all of its content and its ongoing updates by the developers that listen to their community! Codemaster you've outdone yourself!!!Drive safe!			",255,29,30,43,111,1,86

								Driving in real life is easier than in this game. Jokes apart, this game, even though it's in early access is extremely polished and well designed. I have never played any other game in the Dirt series and only after playing the game did I find out that it is in Early Access. Yes, there is a steep learning curve but if you practice for some time then you get the hang of it and it is extremely fun to play. The graphics are fabulous and well optimized for low-end computers too. The sound design and music is simple yet effective.Dirt Rally is very well made and a more finished product than most AAA games made by big studios.10/10 - ♥♥♥♥ EA and Ubisoft.			",82,5,2,12,6,0,6

												Wow. Just Wow.What a fantastic game. I have been so bored with recent racing games. They feel so vanilla.This game feels like my old Peugeot 205 GTi or my recent Peugeot 405 T16. Brutal if driven wrong, beyond rewarding if driven right. There are so many moments, where just like in a real car, you flinch for the brake and pray the car turns in, but it just understeers like a dog into a tree and ruins your entire race, just like the real thing would. So nice to feel like you're really driving a car :) Have to say though, the top spec cars absolutely require a wheel and pedals. You just can't drive them with a digital accelerator! Damn right as well. Most cars are just fine, and even brilliant fun with a keyboard :)Have now added an HTC Vive + Revive + G29 Wheel. I can't recommend this game in VR more highly. It is just perfect. So so good. Runs like a _dream_ on an R9 Fury X w/ 1.4 super sampling, albiet with custom quality settings.Anyways. Bravo! Top notch game, worth every damn cent.EDIT: There are 1 annoying aspects to the game (currently)2. The tiny ripple of gravel on the edge of the road (Wales you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!) will flip your car like a playing card. It has been improved, but sometimes it feels a bit too rigid.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								After you try DiRT Rally you will probably never want to go back to any previous DiRT game, Codemasters have done an incredible job so far bringing realism and thrill to Rally racing and with the addition of the FIA World RX to the mix its a must have game for anyone that enjoys watching the real RX championship.The game is still being updated as part of Early Access, and it still has some issues and missing basic PC features such as mouse menu support, but overall for an Early Access game it is very well polished.If you are looking for a great Rally and Rallycross game you won't find a better one on the market then DiRT Rally.

												Hands down one of the best driving games I have ever had the pleasure of owning. Would I recommend this to you? If you're looking for a challenging driving experience, I would say go for it.The game speaks for itself in a lot of ways. It doesn't hold your hand. The only way you're going to get a podium finish in this game is if you fight for it. But the satisfaction of finally getting there is part of what makes this game so great.I've never focused more in a video game than I have in DiRT Rally. Whether it's in the lush countryside of Germany or the steep rocky trails of Greece, they all have one thing in common; the courses are beautiful. The level of detail in this game is astonishingly well done. The courses presented are true to life and do an excellent job of capturing the scenery. I've found myself slowing down a few times just to admire the view. Whether that view is of the landscape or the car I'm driving, it's always a treat.This game has a lot more to offer than just good visuals. With 39 cars available, ranging from the 60s to modern, there is something here for everyone (personally I can't get enough of the 95' Impreza). While all the cars aren't terribly different from one another, at least not in the same category, they each have their own little personality that can make you love them or hate them.Alongside the career mode that you can progress through, there are also daily, weekly, and monthly leaderboard challenges. These really help the longevity of the game since it's literally infinite challenges. You can also just create your own tournaments or do quick runs on a chosen course(s). If there's one thing I can say that disappointed me with DiRT Rally, it's the number of courses. After you spend many hours with the game, you start to learn locations by heart. Suddenly your co-driver becomes more of a nuisance than a valuable guide. It loses a little of its luster after that. I understand that recreating iconic courses like this is very expensive and time consuming, but it's a little disappointing nonetheless. This is one of the games I hope they release DLC for. I would gladly fork out some cash for some more content of this quality. tl;drOne of the best rally experiences ever created. Get it if you're a rally fan and are up for a challenge.

A good setup is key.Graphics are awesome, physics are ""realistic"" as far as i can judge and this is the first really good rally drive since RBR.Pacenotes need some improvements in some cases.

								This game might be early access (actually it is and I really hope for more content and improvements) but it's already on his way to be a masterpiece. Definitely the MOST IMMERSIVE driving game I've ever tried.Everything makes the immersion to such a high level: the rattling sound of dirt and small rocks hitting the bottom of the car, the copilot's voice getting more excited and fast paced in the most daunting part of the tracks, the water droplets hitting your windshield, the attention to details such as road signs, animals, houses, the reflection of the sun/moon in puddles, but even more it's the FEELING of the car.This game truly makes you feel the car on each and every surface: different behaviour for different sources, different cars, different tuning and even based on different weather conditions.You want to feel  something that will make your heart race? Try a stage at night with rain in a powerful beast like the Delta Integrale... you'll find yourself holding your breath and twisting and turning your body at every turn!Fully recommended!

This game instantly reminds me of the McRae series! Nice graphics,astonishing sound effects,superb gameplay and physics make this game one of the best racing titles of all time. You get around 50 cars,almost 100 stages with different conditions(all terrain-weather combinations available) plus daily-weekly-monthly multyplayer challenges and more.  If you like rally and racing games,this is an absolute purchase. Not for the faint of hearted,arcaders! quitters,but exclusively for hardcore-true gamers. Thank you Codemasters.

												This and Toybox Turbos are both examples of what Codemasters can do when they rein in the budgets and give their titles focus. Both titles benefit, and we finally get to see another fully realistic rally game as a result. The controls have no weird kinks, there's no overlong segues between menus, it's just pick how long you wanna race for, pick the car you wanna race in and a loading screen later you're on a track.You might be scared into thinking that a fully realistic rally game would demand a several-thousand-dollar Fanatec setup, but I've been playing this game on a cheap Ikea desk with a Logitech gamepad for half a year and I can get top-100 times using just that. It takes practise, sure, but no more than on that complex sim setup.This game is now out of Early Access, and there's two main gameplay modes: Time trials on special stages, as in classic rally tradition; and Rally Cross, that being a six-car race on a short track with a mix of on-road and off-road sections. There's no tutorial, this game relies entirely on its progression mechanics as a way to teach you. You get just enough money to buy a slow 1960s car and you get pitted against other equally slow 1960s cars. The game also makes it explicit that you have no chance to win your first few championships by having you earn upgrades every time you use your car, its way of saying that it's okay to take it slow and just learn how to handle the machine you're in. Those first stages become oddly relaxing, and an exercise in just learning the track and the car.There's other similarly relaxing mechanics in place. You start with a mechanics team who can't properly mend your car after a stage, and you won't be able to pay for one for some time. You're forced to make the decision between driving fast and suffering on a later stage, or driving slow and- oh hold on, I got a better time. That's the beauty of it, the game teaches you to drive slow without ♥♥♥♥ing up, and thereby saving you tens of seconds. Contrast this with Dirt 2 and Dirt 3. You'd start with cars that go too fast, handle terribly, your only clue for how to drive is a literal rainbow road and instead of a proper tutorial or forcing you to learn your car, those games just had a mulligan button. As soon as you learned how that first car drove, every car after would be a cakewalk. Dirt Rally shows that you can have proper teaching tools AND be fun AND be a completely realistic simulation at the same time, and it's very much to Codemasters' credit for achieving that.There's some excellent asymmetric multiplayer going on. The last few Codemasters games did have online leaderboards but this game takes that aspect and really runs with it. You can create your own league where your friends can join in and post times on specific events, any time of day they want. It's a great way to keep a group of friends competing with each other.I do have one complaint: Dirt Rally could do with some optimization. Some stages play at a stable 120+ FPS, others might dip below 30 on the exact same settings, including weather. Setting weather to High (not Low, which is slower) and trees to Very Low helps. It's odd.This game has some great voice acting. It's only one actor, he only plays one role, and he's your copilot. There's genuine nervousness in the way he reads his notes, at times he skips a beat and you just know going through all this he's pumped up on adrenaline. It's the perfect way to fill in the silence left by the menu music, and lends a lot to the game's serious racing atmosphere. Though the fact that he makes wrong calls is a bit unnerving. Not sure if that's a bug.I heartily recommend this game.			",248,44,20,18,13,2,14

												I have only just bought and played 2 stages, but already I am in love with it! I kind of loved Dirt 2, and parts of Dirt 3 were excellent, but the mandatory Gymkhana crap ruined the game...I really only enjoyed the straight rally races and trailblazer game modes, which were very enjoyable.Dirt 3 held your hand way too much as well with driving assists etc. overall it felt like a step backwards from Dirt 2. Dirt Rally feels more like Dirt 2, but more difficult and much less arcade like, which just makes it all the more rewarding.This game...This game is fairly unforgiving of your mistakes, but still manages to feel awesome! Love it so far. I found myself clenching my jaw (and my butt cheeks!) quite a bit. A good rush to be had. The sense of speed is impressive.Graphics are great and the sound design is also very satisfying. Performance never dropped below 60 on ultra with a GTX970 at 1440p.I have recently tried hacking together a VR headset with my phone, with some success, but the set up wasn't anywhere near perfect...This game might be just the motivation I need to tweak that set-up to perfection!*OCULUS THRIFT VR UPDATE* Ok, so using my phone, a BOBOVR Z4 headset, and some software trickery (to get the game into 3D and trick Nvidia into thinking my phone is a shield device), I was able to get low latency, decent framerate, wireless VR working with this game.The software is Trinus VR (which you install on the phone and the PC), Moonlight (which you install on the phone to make Nvidia think it is a shield) and Tridef 3D (which converts the game into 3D, but possibly isn't needed? I'm sure there are other ways to do it, I just haven't figured out how yet). The last piece of software is called OpenTrack, which you install on your phone and PC and it wirelessly transmits the head-tracking info from the phone to the PC.The resolution is only 1080p, but the frame-rate is generally pretty good (close to 60 with a few drops here and there). Motion tracking seems to work well, but to be honest, you rarely want to look anywhere but straight forwards unless you enjoy crashing a lot...Setting it up and getting everything running wasn't exactly a walk in the park (still a few disconnection issues to figure out), and even after getting things working, tweaking Trinus VR to get the image right for my headset took a decent amount of time too (a lot of pausing the game, disconnecting from the wireless streaming service, tweaking, reconnecting and repeat, until it was good enough.I haven't used an Oculus DK2 or Razer HDK1, but I imagine that the visual quality is about the same, for what amounts to a fraction of the cost. Worth checking out if you want to get a feel for VR without breaking the bank.If I have time, I might throw together a tutorial to show folks how I got it working. There are guides around for the smartphone VR setup, but none that solved everything for me. I had to use bits from several to find a working solution.			",172,38,8,20,10,2,14

New cars, improved ""My Career"" mode, and more realistic handling, far better graphics and last but not least realistic surroundings, narrow circuits like in real life, circuits width might change during the race.I recommend it if you're a race-simulator enthusiast.

I have played this game now for 5 hours now, still havent won a race, placed 3rd in my first world champinmship, but am loving every second. The driving is challenging but rewarding, no mini-map, only your co-driver to guide you. And when your racing through Wales in a Stratos with no front lights, good luck, its all ears and alot of guess work, but you can do it.The only thing that i think needs work is the co-driver calls, there are some corners that are rated 1 but should really be a hard turn.

								I used to consider myself a veteran in rally types of games.All the way from RB and CMR 1 I watched evolution of rallying on PCs.Yet, when this game came into my hands, I suddenly felt like an amateur. I couldn't make turns, I kept sliding off the road, driving without ABS (which was, for me, a must in previous games!) was a suicidal attempt at taking even small curves ...But I kept going at it, race after race after race.Slowly reaching higher ranks.And the game awards you with awe of achievement.If you want to be in a struggle, not experience laid back arcade style racing, I heartwarmingly recommend this game.9,4  / 10 (and rising)			",25,3,1,2,4,0,4

								I've been looking for a rally simulation game for a while.  I've played Richard Burns Rally, but it's pretty outdated now.  Dirt Rally is awesome.  Tons of control on setting up the car.  Very different performance characteristics between FWD, RWD and 4WD cars.  The courses are all based on real locations and are very well done.  There are some bugs here and there, but I've just been really enjoying it.  The courses are the biggest thing to me.  I've been following WRC for the past couple years and been to the Pikes Peak HC so it was very important to me that a simulation game match real life and I have to say it's excellent.  I can even identify the spots on Pikes Peak where I've spectated.  Really cool.Love the game.			",35,1,1,7,4,0,4

								Not much to say that hasn't been said. It's the greatest rally game yet! Codemaster's really outdid themselves here and its awesome! Don't listen to the bad reviews that say its no fun with gamepad. I use a 360 and the controls are very manageable! Can still get top tier without too much trouble if i stay on the track! The daily, weekly, monthly challanges are what makes this game especially great among the flawless sounds, physics, and immersiveness! I really like the fact that codemastered didn't make the game too graphically demanding that people with lower graphics cards like mine can still run it with no trouble! I appreciate that!Things i would like to see: -leaderboard scores for each individual country.-racing each other's online ghosts on rally stages and championships like in colin mcrae rally 3 and i think 4. -of course more rally locations, stages.edit: would love an option to save my replays!It's a short list because the game is already spectacular in early access!

								DiRT Rally is one of those simulator games where players can gain an appreciation of how freaking difficult it is to be a rally driver. Seriously, it must take some massive genitalia to be able to drive this fast.Some notes for you all;-RWD cars slip and slide like it's constantly raining, and that's just on the gravel/asphalt tracks.-You MUST throw the car into corners to get it to turn, but too much and it launches into the wall.-After attempts at what must have been 100 hairpin turns, I finally managed to pull off a scandinavian flick and I was f***ing proud of myself.-Playing with a controller (xbox/ps4) helps immensly, and if you have a racing wheel, it makes driving so much easier.-DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DRIVE THE HILLCLIMB CARS AT ALL - I repeat, the hillclimb cars only start pulling at 5000-6000 RPM and scream up until their max RPM, where you are forced to change gears after only moving 10 metres. But hell they're fun.-Driving in Manual is way too much fun, don't even bother starting with automatic if you want a challenge.Hell, after writing all of this I want to go try a stage without crashing. Maybe.One heck of a game that will keep getting better as time goes on.			",71,10,4,1,3,0,2

								I have always liked a casual dabble with an arcade racer, even a bit of Forza occasionally.  But, midway through a love affair with Driveclub I came across Dirt Rally.   That was a few weeks back and I haven't played anything since.  It's incredible and I didn't even realise that I liked sim rally racing.It's definitely difficult but somehow that makes it more accessible, which is weird.  It's like the Dark Souls of racing games.  And it's a beauty to look at and runs extremely well on a pretty modest PC (1st gen i5 and 2Gb 7870 here).I have hundreds of hours gameplay left with this game, and even after I've seen everything in the game, I can imagine playing this for a long time just because it's so exciting.Lastly, I did have fun with a pad, but pretty soon I realised I needed a wheel so bought a secondhand Logitech DFGT for peanuts, and it's so much more satisfying and fun to play.  So, I'd recommend getting at least a budget FFB wheel and if you are on a budget I don't think the DFGT can be beat.			",114,42,6,8,9,2,9

								Best rally game in a long, long while. Unlike previous games in the DiRT series, DR leans more towards proper simulation. There are no flashbacks, you can't repeat races indefinitely, you can't turn off car damage and time penalties for car recovery are very harsh. You can also tune your ride to your own preference, gain upgrades, and hire a team of mechanics to keep your car in good shape.As the title implies, this game is all about rallying, so say goodbye to Gymkhana and ""BRO SICK RACE BRO, YOU GOTTA POST THAT ON YOUTUBE"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The tracks are really good, they're well designed, the circuits are longer than before and the environments look impressive. Car physics are stellar, you can literally feel every bump on the road. And the audio is just superb, you can hear the gravel hitting your car, you can hear the brakes grinding when you push them too far etc. As far as i can tell, the game is also really well optimized. Quality work.DiRT Rally is in early access, but it's already rich in content, and it's going to grow at least twice in size before release. In my opinion, it already feels like the best rally game Codemasters ever made.			",316,42,4,64,35,2,61

TL/DR REVIEW: Awesome!DIRT Rally very different from the previous installments of DIRT games. Instead of the usual arcade approach, this game gives players a believable, unforgiving rally simulation experience. This is a very welcome change of pace. With a wheel it's an absolute blast. My only two complaints/wishes are for there to be more stages and/or some kind of stage editor, and for the tarmac to be better simulated in the game. Dirt Rally has a lot of different environments, but unfortunately only a couple stages per location.Final noteThis is not an in depth or complete review of the game. It simply sums up my experience with the game in an effort to help you make a more informed purchasing decision. ",84,1,10,1,12,1,7

												TL;DR: BESTRACINGGAMEEVER+It's challenging. This game isn't going to hold your hand and may make small children cry. +80-90% realistic handling / 10% ""arcadey"" of all vehicles +it's almost exclusively rally and hillclimb;  baby circuit racing ""rallycross"" is tacked on for multiplayer but you don't even have to touch it when playing through the career +realistic pacenotes spoken by your co-driver+TUNING, REPAIRS, UPGRADES, LIVERIES - e.g., you get a flat during a run - fix it instantly for a massive time penalty+Liveries don't appeal to the dudebro demographic - no Subarus covered in obnoxiously large Monster™ logos+ALL of the WIDE VARIETY of classic rally cars are cars that you would actually WANT to drive. You won't find 80 variations of a Nissan Skyline here *cough*GranTurismo5*cough*+According to the store description there are 70 rallies for you to enjoy racing the clock on - yes, a good chunk of them are reversed versions of the same stage, but the stages are so varied in what turns and jumps you have to tackle it doesn't even matter to the point where it would be annoying to NOT get reversed stages+Asode from all the fantastic gameplay features. the scenery you will encounter while rushing past trees at 130 kph is absolutely breathtaking.+The game runs at a solid, stable 60 fps without a hitch and zero issuesI may add more to this review as I unfold and explore this masterpiece of visual pleasurement.

												An absolutely stunning experience with a racing wheel.This game leans more towards sim than it does arcade, the physics are far more realistic than previous DiRT games, although I can't say I'ev ever driven a real rally car. The point is it's harder, much harder, but this makes it so much more rewarding. Nailing slides and jumps really feels like an achievement. You will crash, a lot, and end up restarting stages time and time again, but in doing so you force yourself to improve.The graphics and sounds are great. My rig is an i7 4790k, 16 Gb RAM, GTX 970, and it runs on ultra with 80-120 frames. Graphics feel more realistic than most games due to the lack of saturation, and sounds really do add to the immersion.As for force feedback in the wheel, I'm having a great experience on my Thrustmaster T300RS. I do feel like a gearstick/handbrake would be ideal for this game however as pressing a button on the wheel is awkward.Online servers are currently down, but a quick trip to reddit tells me this is temporary and will most likely be fixed post-boxing day.Overall I'd say this is as, if not more enjoyable than F1 2016 (another excellent Codemasters title). It certainly beats any dirt game to date.8.5/10			",76,12,6,8,13,1,3

												DiRT Rally is an excellent add to DiRT series. The game has been developing fast in the early access, until now when it has come to an version 1.0. I personally hope they still develop the game, because it still feels early access. Multiplayer is still designed poorly. You can only play four players in one rallycross start, and the collection of rallycross cars is very minimum. If Codemasters dont add DLC for More rallycross cars and including FIA RX Touring car and Super1600, i will get very upset. The game still feels a little empty when there are so few cars towards car classes. Think about the big winged Audi S1... ITS NOT IN THE GAME ! DiRT Rally still has one of the best graphics and driveability. Still good game but needs DLC\Updates. I rate it 8\10 Was expecting a little more from codemasters			",18,0,4,2,1,0,1

												This is the most passive-aggressive game ever created.For years now, us video game rally fans have been begging Codemasters to drop the insufferably bad Xtreme Sports hoo-hah that had plagued their once loved rally franchise. We wanted a return to serious rally racing sims without the brotard, Mountain Dew-fueled poop of the previous DiRT games. You just KNEW Colin McRae was rolling around in his grave. So, the Codies, likely sick of hearing the complaining released the single most soul crushing, nut grinding rally game ever in DiRT Rally. It's a rally sim. There's nary a car-fu (or whatever stupid name that stunt event had in previous entries) and this game will eat your soul. It's everything we wanted and I couldn't be happier with it!!!At this early stage of play, I suck really, really hard at it. I have all of the assists on and, counting penalties, I finish each race stage in just under six weeks. My 17-month-old daughter could do at least as well. But when you do something right, you know it happened because you got good at something and were not just lucky. It's rare with modern games that a video game rewards learned skill. When you start doing things right in DiRT Rally, it's completely rewarding.			",426,26,11,23,14,0,17

												Short version. Dirt Rally is an immersive and challenging racing game, but with questionable driving physics. Meaning it was fun to learn, but it finally got tiresome.I have a lot of hours in this game and I did enjoy it, so it seems unfair to give it a negative review. But I stopped playing it for two months and when I recently came back, I couldn't finish a stage! I now realize that this is a difficult arcade game; the challenge is addictive and is complemented by pleasant visuals, great sound design and fine racing tracks. But the driving model is unintuitive, with arguably inaccurate physics.Tarmac handling is bad. The rear wheels are very light and drifty, and braking is vague; wheel lock occurs very late. It was so bad for the Hillclimb cars that they had to patch it. But it remains terrible for the RX supercars. Gravel has more balanced grip, but it is too high! You can annihilate Vatanen's time in Pike's Peak.Grip in Sweden seems to come and go haphazardly... you can't drive aggressively!Finland has absurd jumps and is too wide. Vehicles feel very stiff; they bounce too much from small bumps. Cars lack rotational momentum. Combined with the high gravel grip, using the handbrake is too easy, and Scandinavian flicks are ineffective for most cars. Without the handbrake, there is a lot of understeer! Except for the RWDs, which have incredible lift-off oversteer (R5 and Manta excluded).Car dynamics look unnatural in replays; cars seems to be rotating around a central axis.Career mode is quite repetitive, and you need to spend game credits to participate in events.Car repair is odd; you can repair parts 1% at a time.The automatic reset when hitting spectators or going off track is jarring.Again, the game is good if you are looking for a challenging rally experience. But given that is it described as the ""most authentic rally game ever made"" I can't recommend it.			",69,7,4,2,2,0,1

												For now this is the best rally game since Richard Burns Rally. If everything goes well, it could be the best rally sim since RBR.A pure rally sim is what we need after so many years.//////////Edit 2015/5/27:For now, I have to change some of my previous thoughts about this game.I've played almost all CodeMaster racing games except some F1 series, they all feel the same. CodeMaster made all their racing games feel like you are driving on ice. I feel better the days before Dirt, the whole EGO engine times. Dirt, dirt2, dirt 3, dirt count down, grid, grid 2, grid autosport, fuel, F1 2011, F1 2012, F1 2014, every EGO titles I can remember, they all feel the same---driving like on ice.I think CodeMaster never hired some real driver to qualify the car physics, and almost every racing titles CM made are better controlled on joysticks/gamepads rather than on racing wheels. We invited many people who has deep real world driving experiences including some real racer to try out many CodeMaster racing titles both on gamepad and racing wheels. All of them can drive pretty good on racing wheels with racing sims like rFactor, iRacing, NFS13, Simbin titles, the new AC. But few of them feel good on any CodeMaster racing titles when driving with racing wheels. It just feels too fake on the car physics. CodeMaster racing games only perform good with controllers like gamepads.Till now, after many hours of test drive in Dirt Rally, I admit everything goes better except car physics.Is this one a Richard Burns Rally successor? Definitely not. Maybe some arcade racing fans would like this. But for a sim racer? Let's go back and play RBR.I may change the advisory after its official release to ""Not Recommended"". Just be prepared.Edit Sep 18th, 2016:I bought this game very early right after its early access release, you may not be able to see my review since the new Steam review system change. And now I have over hundreds of hours of playing time on it.I still recommend it to any race fans, rally fans, car fans. It's definitely one of the best rally games since Richard Burns Rally. It's a rally race game you can enjoy hours after hours with racing wheels or just a good mechanical keyboard.I think every little bit of things are good or even exellent in DiRT Rally. Despite some kids may not get fully understoodment of what a ""Race Sim"" should be, they may feel it being too hard to drive. But one knows he should follow traffic rules in real life driving, how could he not follow the same rules driving in a race sim? Or a semi-sim. Everything feels right of this title for now. EXCEPT ONE: the physics.I don't have much real world driving experience, I have some in Richard Burns Rally, which I played since my 9 grade class and played it almost 10 years. DiRT Rally lacks a proper physics as being a modern race sim comparing to the 14-year-old Richard Burns Rally. The later one does it better here. But this may not be a problem for a casual gamer who just want to kick the throttle and accelerate to hundreds of kilometers per hour speed and drift like there is no Newton Law at all. The most obvious feel is that the car is too light and whenever it hit something it just bump up into the air. You will feel that as long as you play.I think Codemasters is trying to find a balanced point where they can satisfy casual race gamers and semi-sim race gamers. If so, DiRT Rally has done a great job.			",229,28,18,17,43,0,29

Early Access Review
								In my early access review I said that this game wasn't better than RBR. Now that this game has got brand new handling system and steering wheel support, I can happily say that Richard Burns Rally (published in 2004) has finally got another game to it's side in the legendary group of rally racing games. The handling is perfect for a steering wheel (I've got CSR Forza wheel), and the graphics and physics are awesome. This game is totally a simulation, not a crappy arcade game with cars going on rails like the older Dirt games. Although if you don't have a controller or a steering wheel, this game might be too hard for you. Just saying, the carreer mode is really hard.Another point I'd like to say, is that this game has free (YES, LITERALLY FREE) updates every month. I just hope they keep updating the game. If done so, this game will have a long lifespan.TL;DR: Awesome game, everything's good.Thank you codemasters for making this game.			",89,13,14,6,7,2,3

								The game is a true simulator, the rally game that Codemasters should launch a long time ago.The gameplay is what you expect from a simulator, the graphics look amazing in and out of the car and it's amazing. And it's the Dark Souls of racing games and I'm in love.The only problem are a shortage of cars, expecially in the 80's RWD who misses the great Lancia O37 and also when you want to reverse sometimes doesn't work and it bugs the stering, but it's still an Early Access so these little problems will be fixed.I hope so, expecialy the number of cars.     It's -         2 - 1960's        3 - 1970's        2 - 1980's RWD        5 - Group B        3 - Group A        2 - 2010'sCars I think that could be added: Lancia O37, Renault 5 Turbo, Renault Alpine A110, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IV, Volkswagen Polo R, 1990's Ford Focus RS, Toyota Corolla/Celica, etc...

												This game is a masterpiece, simply said. All simulators should look up to this. Over a year has passed since Early Access, and we all saw this game evolve. There were monthly updates and constant patches that brought this game to it's full glory. Constantly adding new cars and tracks, tweaks and new game modes. This game has really realistic engine, cars are badass, from early '60s to Modern Beasts, it has it all. It has rally on every type of surface (Dirt,Gravel,Snow,Tarmac,Ice..) , to every weather condition possible (Sunny,Rain,Snowy,Fog..). Career mode is well designed and really entertaining, making you start rally with '60 vehicles, and then you slowly progress trough generations of cars. There is hillclimb, featuring Pikes Peak, 20km huge hillclimb. In hillclimb there is 2 car classes and 3 types of surfaces. Also there is WorldRX also known as RallyCross, where you have 3 classes (Since  of Console Release) and RallyCross also has Multiplayer feature. This game currently has 6 Rallys and 9 car classes ('60s, '70s, '80s, Group B [AWD], Group B [RWD], Group A, F2 Kit Car, R4, 2000s, 2010s). So yeah this game has everything for everyones taste. Game is really difficult, winning a stage on this game, not rally, a stage makes you fell like you are on top of the world. Game is really unforgiving and requires huge skill and lots and lots of practise! If you are a car lover, this is a must have!Verdict: Amazing+ Lots of Content for Everyones Taste+ Challenging Experience+ Simulation+ Visuals, Sound and Gameplay are Amazing+ Brilliant Handling			",47,3,12,4,5,2,3

												This feels more like a finished product than Early Access, while some tracks/cars still need to be added in the future. But wow, great driving, great physics. Some of the banks act a little erratic, my only complaint so far. Well, the more I play, the more I find hidden barriers and then segments of ditches that look like the same ditches you drive over without a problem, except these ditches send you flying. If you try to cut corners and narrow your line it's quite simply unpredicable whether you will fly out fine or end up in the trees. 7/10			",2005,631,82,246,196,18,265

Brief summaryOf all current rally games, DiRT Rally is one truly great game for those looking for an exhilerating, intense and fun experience; therefore, it really is one of my favourite on-the-edge-of-the-seat driving games. There are a lot of cars and various real-life stages with the challenging bumps and road width, and the co-driver is generally excellent in guiding through stages. Cars generally feel and sound fantastic on gravel and snow. The only downside for me is the unrealistic tyre model and  abrupt dynamic behaviour on asphalt. On the whole, I would wholeheartedly recommend DiRT Rally to anyone to enjoys the exciting world of motorsports. 8.5/10._________Cars and tracksThere are plenty of iconic rally cars from several classes, such as modern WRC machines, classic ‘70s, contemporary R4 cars to vehicles from the Group B era. In total, thirty-nine cars are available, and it is very noticeable that each have a specific handling. Thirty of these cars are available to drive in point-to-point rally stages. One particularly good aspect is that most of the cars sound very realistic in engine noise, and that they really seem to have a raw roar/irregularity to them as heard in their real-life counterparts. There is an upgrading system in the career mode; cars start out underpowered and overweight, and only after driving them several hundreds of kilometers, they will have the correct figures. Consequently, drivers that do not belong to the top 5% or so will have a hard time to win rally stages until they drive further.In terms of tracks, currently there are six countries: Greece, Monaco, Finland, Sweden, Wales and Germany. Each country features two unique long stages, which are around the 10 km mark, or between the high six and low eight minutes of driving time, depending on driving skill. Smaller stages are just segments from all the main stages. Furthermore, the stages are also offered to be driven in backward direction for more variation. The best thing, however, is that these tracks are modeled after parts of real rally stages. Stages can be very bumpy and upsetting cars, and at times are very treacherously narrow. When the co-driver calls a ‘caution’, it is imperative to drive slower and more accurately in order to avoid crashes. In my opinion, this aspect really makes the game fantastic to play. The only downside is that stages tend to be somewhat repetitive since one rally can consists of short stages which appear again as longer stages. Additionally, players who play this game many, many hours will find that at one point the stages have become familiar and that a co-driver is not necessary anymore, which personally takes a slight bit of fun out of the game. From that point of view, it can be argued that more track variety is needed, but I feel that the game offers plenty of tracks for at least several tens of hours of fun. Next to normal rallying, there are three rallycross circuits and a few special rallycross cars with up to 600 horsepower. Additionally, there is the Pikes Peak hillclimb, which is being offered in a fully-paved layout and a part gravel, part asphalt layout. Currently, there are a few historical hillclimb cars, such as the Audi Quattro S1 and the Peugeots 405 and 205 T16. Overall, content-wise there is much to offer, in my opinion. Game modesThere is a career mode, in which rally stages are offered sequentially per country. While changing between countries, it is possible to switch cars. Online multiplayer is offered only in rallycross mode, sadly. For point-to-point rally stages, the only multiplayer component is comparing stage times with friends or the rest of the world. Furthermore, it is possible to setup specific leagues with set rules and regulations, and there are periodic events organized by the developers that offer nice moneraty rewards. Co-driverOne of the best features in the game; the notes are clear and when set to ‘very early’, most of the time are very reliable in facilitating driving fast down a road that is not entirely familiar to the driver in advance. In high speed corners, the co-driver also talks faster and in a more severe tone, while he is calmer when driving slower. There are only a few slight mistakes in corner severity numbers being called, but overall the accuracy is very high. I find it a joy to drive without the HUD and being able to fully depend on the co-driver in this game. Driving dynamicsAnother important aspect that has made the game so much fun for me is the handling. In basic terms of dynamics, the cars feel realistic; modern WRC machines are very neutral, have very short braking distances and carry enormous amounts of speed through corners with high control, whilst older rear-wheel drive cars (especially from Group B) are very twitchy and unforgiving under power, depending on the exact car model. While playing, it is not uncommon to spin under power, and avoiding such a spin is hugely satisfactory. All other cars sit in between these two extremes; generally, the older the car, the lower the overall stability of the cars during acceleration, braking and coasting. What I also like, is that any driving over the limit will result in brushing the walls or trees, often resulting in car damage or at the very least a loss of time. It makes the game challenging, but also very rewarding at the same time. Personally, I find the handling of DiRT Rally on gravel (Wales, Greece, Finland) the most realistic: braking distances are longer now compared to the previous early-access handling and feel spot-on. Furthermore, cars do not loose too much momentum when sliding sideways through corners, but instead it is simulated that the wheels dig into the gravel surface and generate more lateral grip. The quantity of weight transfer (or actually wheel load transfer) on this surface feels the most accurate to me, because it is possible to make the car ‘dance’ between corners while being sideways. The same applies to pure snow and ice (Sweden and parts of Monaco); there is a fluidity in the cars handling that requires a certain precision in throttle, braking and steering inputs. However, the cars may be too forgiving when exaggerating inputs, which brings me to the remaining surface: asphalt (Germany and parts of Monaco). This is where the game is at its weakest; there seems to be no realistic relation whatsoever between grip and slip angle (the difference between the angle of the front wheels and the general direction the car is travelling in). The problem is that there is a lot of grip when expected, but that grip loss happens very abruptly and untrue to rubber tyres on asphalt.  At higher speeds above 100 km/h or so, it is not too bad, since cars do grip and generally understeer under power when going too fast through a corner. However, at these speeds there is too little sideways slip, so driving sideways and having to correct with the steering in third gear or higher like in onboards videos on Youtube is sadly not possible. The lower speeds is where the handling simulations lacks the most: this is where the cars do oversteer, but the rate of angular acceleration is far too great to be believable. Unfortunately, this phenomenon also means that the best stage times are achieved with a lower steering angle settings since slides can be corrected quicker and unfrotunately, without a loss of stability. In real life, the fastest way would be balancing between too much and too little steering input, and for that reason, I personally always set my steering wheel at 900° of steering and therefore always lose some speed, even though the recommended by Codemasters is 540°, and the fastest people even use 270° or less. Despite this crazy car behaviour and optional 'physics cheat', the driving is still sufficiently enjoyable on tarmac. Still not great compared to gravel handling, but acceptible.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DiRT Rally takes sport seriously, but it has some problems too.Pros:*Great driving - fun, responsive, each car feels different.*The tracks are dangerous and punishing*Driving with a steering wheel, with no HUD and assists (just the co-pilot) is a BLAST!*Graphics are nice*Online events create an amazing competitive feel and variety.Cons:*This game suffers from the syndrome where you fall out of the track and your car gets instantly put back, BUT sometimes it actually DNFs you and shows your car as unrecoverable. This makes no sense, since at times I can fall out quite far and be put back and at other times I get a DNF with sliding out just slightly and if you proceed, then you are DNF'd from the WHOLE EVENT - this makes ZERO sense. Sometimes you slide out quite slightly (experienced it mostly in winter stages), you get an ''unrecoverable car"" and you can't even progress to the next stage) - and at other times I can hit a wall at 150 KM/h and keep racing. There is NO balance here...*The crashing visualisation is very weak compared to other Codemasters games - I was actually expecting, that I crash and destroy my car and it would make sense that I can't continue, but that doesn't happen. Sometimes it is too easy to blow my tire (after a minor crash) and at others I can't get any response from a crash. Read the previous point - it works together with graphics, where it almost always seems illogical, how you can/can't continue a race. The biggest issue for me is those annoying fade out->fade in(put back on track) sh*ts - it's stupid! Let me crash properly and make a proper response in visual and actual damage! (There is always a restart option.... except where there isn't)This game has a LOT of things I have always wanted in a real rally game, but others pull it back at being the same old same old. Generally, if you make to the end of the race and don't crash - it feels like the best thing EVER, until you crash....7,5/10 (it is a good score, btw - still recommended)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								It's been a long while since I've picked up a gamepad to play a driving game; indeed it's been a long time since there's been a driving game that I've been genuinely excited about. Having stumbled upon DiRT Rally, and having purchased the title on a whim, I'm can honestly say that the game has completely exceeded my expectations -- even in its current Early Access form.I'm no seasoned racing-sim professional, not by any stretch; however, it seems that DiRT Rally is set to deliver a bona-fide rally driving experience in what is a serious departure from the arcadey, lowbrow mayhem for which the DiRT series has become known.The game is visually gorgeous and the sound-design is spot on. But what's most impressive is the feel -- the handling of the vehicles, the physics, and the immersion. Although cliche, the game really is easy to play but difficult to master. It offers a challenging but highly rewarding experience that I've not known before in any racing title. Comparisons have already been drawn to Colin McCrae (also of Codemasters fame). Such comparisons are totally warranted.There are some obvious limitations with the game at the moment. But far from being nit-picky I will let the development run it's course and post a more thorough review upon full release. I am more than satisified with my purchase to this point, and would definitely recommend the game to any seasoned rally-sim fans or even someone looking to try something new :)			",64,7,2,2,14,0,20

								I'm sliding/bouncing down a road in Greece with every bump causing more and more instability and I know that every time I bounce into the air the odds on me making it to the bottom of the hill in one piece are diminishing but I also know that if I land with my brakes applied I'll almost certainly lose control so the only option is to cling onto the wheel, correct as much as I can and hope for the best.After playing nearly every driving game released since Buggy Boy on the Amiga this is the first game that has ever made me want to go slower on a straight.

												In terms of hours played I might not have played a lot compared with other people, but I've been playing racing games since I first had a PC/Console. Most of the racing titles are easy to beat or have wonky physics (exceptions are made ofcourse). This on the other hand feels fantastic to drive! Just bought a wheel primarily with this game in mind. All the early access hours were spend on a Xbox 360 controller though. If you are worried that you need a wheel in order to enjoy the game fully I can safely say that you don't.Every since the CMR series ended I have been waiting for a great rally game. The previous Dirt games weren't that, but this is. Be prepared to crash a lot in the beginning, but also be prepared to get addicted.			",17,0,7,0,0,0,0

								To get started, this is a huge improvement over DiRT 3. The stages are longer, way more realisim, the graphics are improved and the menus (to me at least) look way better than the DiRT 3 ones. One thing i will say is that you should probably get a racing wheel pedals and a gear shifter, i feel like it would make it so much easier to control the car without some of the assists. Anyways, I dont have any major problems with the game except that it would randomly kick me out of fullscreen mode, I'm not sure why it does it, but its not game breaking as it pauses the game when it happens.I would rate this game 9.8/10Great game CodeMasters keep it up!! (but let us use our mice on the menus plz)EDIT: if you dont have a wheel with pedals, THIS GAME WILL GIVE YOU A ♥♥♥♥ING ANEURYSM WITH HOW MUCH IT WILL ♥♥♥♥ YOU OFF WITH A KEYBOARD. like ♥♥♥♥ing seriously my keyboard only has 3 presses at one time and that is just not enough for this game. Almost broke my hand punching my crt monitor after every turn would result in ♥♥♥♥ing my car up so bad. Still an amazing game, but you just need a wheel to play.EDIT 11/24/16: Ive had a real gamepad for awhile now and it makes things so much easier			",93,8,12,13,31,2,18

												So far I'm having fun time with the game. It drives really well and looks good; some people have said that it might not be a true sim experience, but it's definitely a hardcore game that requires you to really get into the mechanics if you want to get good results. Never driven a rally car, but those real life car handling techniques I'm familiar with work wonderfully here. The career system is actually very sim-like, you literally start at the bottom leagues with ancient cars and progress buying better ones, advancing forward after successful tournaments and events. It just feels so very slow if you were already used to modern cars in early access.And extra point for having very clear and simplistic menus, without throwing DLC constantly on your face (looking at you Dirt 3).

								First of all, Im a huge rally fan and the only games that i truely liked was back in 2005, WRC Rally Evolved and RBR, but this game is just my number 1 now. It's an amazing feeling to drive, pshysics are insane, pure rally feeling.I highly recommend this game for everyone who loves rally and motorsports BUT only if you have a wheel with force feedback! You not gonna enjoy this with a keyboard nor with a controller so think about that before you buy. So thanks Codemasters for this! Can't wait for the Winter Wonderland pack!What I'd like to see : -Random hazards like in WRC Evolved (It was amazing back then and very unique)-Damage model already great but I'd really like if the suspension break out or something, fire if the car really broke you know what i mean.-More WRC's like Fabia WRC or 206, I think there's already enough old cars.So I recommend to buy it because you not gonna find better rally game for a long time I think.

Early Access Review
								One of the best games I've been playing for a long time.I'm into racing simulations since I can think, but with the most game you either have a good racing sim, OR a nice career mode. Until Dirt Rally came up that technically combines a realistic feel with nice graphics and a career mode and multiplayer leagues that is fun to play.First of all, the support by the developers is OUTSTANDING. This is the first early access game that is fun to watch as it's doing a BIG progress with continuous updates and new non-DLC content. Frequently new stages, cars and even game modes have been released, handling is tweaked, bugs are fixed, performance improved - that's amazing. The developers really read the ideas and suggestions on the DIRT forums and implement respective functionality into the game. This is the first Early Access game where I can clearly feel the developers absolutely developing a game according to the player's feedback. So the many, many positive reviews here on Steam are very well deserved. The handling:I've been used to older Dirt games, but also played Richard Burns Rally a lot. RBR was supposed to be the most authentic rally sim and drifting in RBR was actually really easy. Somehow I believed that RBR is top of the notch and after playing Dirt Rally in a very early stage, I thought that Dirt Rally is far away from being realistic, because cars won't drift the way I want, engaging drifts and doing hairpins wasn't that easy as in other Rally Sims. However, the more I played, the more I noticed that the ""unrealistic"" handling is actually only a result of my bad driving skills, because in Dirt Rally you actually have to know what you do with your car and how to set up your car to make it drift the way you want. The more you learn about car physics and rally driving techniques, the more you'll notice that Dirt Really is very accurate in simulating the car handling under specific conditions. You can really feel a big difference in the setup and the different car types such as AWD, RWD and FWD. You can use all sorts of real world driving techniques to get these different cars to slide the way you want and it works pretty accurate. Whenever you do a crash thanks to oversteering or understeering, there always is a logic explanation of what caused the car to behave that way. Thus said, after 25 hours of drifting and sliding through the game, I honestly consider this to be the most authentic handling when it comes to rally games.The career mode:The career mode is actually a really nice one, at the moment divided into Classic Rally (With co-driver), Hill Climb (Without co-driver) and Rally Cross (The non-Dirt3-like realistic version). You're not going to participate in single events, but always in whole championships that are divided into different countries which again are divided into different rally stages. Once you're through all events and land on the podium on the end of the championship, you're allowed to participate in a more advanced championship with of course more advanced AI opponents. Thus said, the more you advance, the more difficult it gets. So as a beginner, you'll most likely have problems winning the first championship on the first try, but on the second try you most likely will. The championship system always ensures you got a proper competition, so the game is never too easy or too hard. It will keep you challenged, but it's not too frustrating. Indeed it is very motivating because you can clearly see how you improve your times and driving skills during time until you reach the next championship level. Also you got the ability to repair your car each and every two stages you drove. Your mechanics got half an hour to repair a wide selection of different car parts, all having an impact on the driving. If you drive stages at night, you better repair the head lights of your car before you tweak the suspension. So you always have to make wise decisions on what you actually are going to repair during that half hour. However, you can also entirely destroy your car so it's not repairable. If this happens, the championship is over and you'll loose everything.Team management:There is also the ability to manage your team. You can hire crew members, and the more skilled these people are, the more they cost, but therefor they need less time to repair specific car parts throughout the championship. You can check how long their contracts will run and you will have to make sure that none of the contracts is expiring during your championships. You can fire people, replace them, and your team will even level up the more you drive in events. Good stuff: It's not important to win to level up your team and car, but it's only important that you actually drive. The more KM you drove with team members hired, the more they will progress and level up. So even if you got stuck on a specific difficulty, driving and playing the games still provides a progress. If a specific member reached a level up, you have access to perks which you can buy to even improve the power of your team.Car upgrades:Another nice aspect is that when you play the championship events, not just your team levels up, but also your car. The more KM you've driven with the car with a specific team, the more your team is going to know your car. So after some kilometers/time, your team starts to install weight reductions/engine and turbo upgrades to your car. Means the more you drive an actual car in your garage, the faster and more powerful it gets since your team keeps improving it. So even without winning championships, you're still earning money for new cars and upgrades for existing cars that make your favorite cars even faster.Multiplayer leagues:You can register and create an account on the RaceNet website, allowing you to keep track of your progress and driving statistics, comparing yourself to other real drivers and participate in online multiplayer events. Also you can race Rally Cross events together with other people on the same track, so you can actually crash and bump into them. This is nice to see your skills and times compared to other real world players.Graphics:Nothing much to say - the graphics are outstanding for a simulation game and look really good. On ultra settings on my machine it sometimes doesn't look exactly as nice as the preview images in Steam, but generally the graphics are nothing someone can moan about. That's all I had to say - this game is technically outstanding and unique in many, many ways. Plus in some months there will even more features by the developers that have not been taken into account on this review. I can just recommend this game to ANYONE who is either a rally fan, likes racing games in general or pure simulations. Everyone is going to have fun with this kind of game, no matter if you like the simulation or if you want to play it with a game pad in an arcade style. Definitely a big recommendation from my side.			",109,7,10,7,19,0,11

												I enjoy racing games that are challenging and has the realism factor to it. I've enjoyed the Collin MacRae series and the only other game to get close to that was the first Dirt, after that it's all been arcadey games which didn't make me feel like I've actually was doing anything. This one is more than that and more, it has heart and it looks like the developers actually want to give us something out of their passion for the series and their roots.I've only played close to two hours and I'm enjoying the career mode a lot, I really enjoy being able to repair and change my roster and things like that. Makes me feel like I'm in charge! Looking forward to see where this game goes over the development period, highly recommended :)---Update: Now that the game is released, this is by far the best Early access game I had the joy to be part of.

So you are mostly racing against the clock vs the ai board time. It's can be very good for some player & can be very bad as it make you learn & improve your driving which some hate.There's only live multiplayer in rallycross which feature only 3 tracks, the rest is about online leaderboard which is closer to reality & well supported daily...

												Firstly, up until now not one single racing game has made me cringe even close to what I do in real life when heading towards a tree, barrier, bank or other solid object with way too much speed. Given that I've bent or broken at least half of my cars while racing and I was a big fan of the venerable Richard Burns Rally (& the RSRBR mod), I like to think that's a good indicator of the tone of the next two words.Until now.Dirt Rally is the best rally game in existence, bar none. RBR was just as good for it's day, but if we'll be realistic it's now over a decade old & it's time to move on. Dirt also captures the sense of speed better than RBR ever did and it's perhaps even more punishing on mistakes - especially in the online Daily, Weekly & Monthly Events. There is no rewind, no restarting. You crash, you're done - they way it should be.Now, to the game itself - I'll start with the short list of negatives.- To be honest, I actually feel the cars may have slightly too much grip, however this is coming from over a decade of RBR. It's not 100% sim, but it's more than close enough.- The stages are made up from one stage per country. This provides heaps of content if you only drive the short stages but it's easy to start memorising the courses after a while.- The only hillclimb is Pike's Peak.- No Australian stages! I live in Coffs Harbour & would absolutely love to be able to barrel along some of our brilliant local WRC stages in game.- The damage model is perhaps a bit too forgiving.Now, for the positives.- Aforementioned cringing when heading face first into a tree.- The graphics are top notch, on max settings it looks absolutely stunning - but still is a little bit much for my R9 390!- It's really, really well optimised for PC - the scaling is huge. That's somethign rare in these days of crap console ports.- The handling. I did say above that it felt a bit too grippy, but it's easily the best on the market at the moment. Really, it's more than enough to create a realistic portrayal of rally and it feels totally natural once you get used to it. I suspect a lot of my problem is I'm playing with a XB360 controller as I don't have a wheel yet.- All the stages, Pike's Peak & the Rallycross circuits are taken from real life tracks - Col de Turini (Monte Carlo), Ouninpohja (Finland), Sweet Lamb (Wales/GB), Baumholder (Germany), Pikes's Peak, Hell (Norway), Lydden Hill (UK) and others. Most are very close, although there are slome slight variances on the rally stages; presumably to save HDD space and make the stages more exciting.- The cars are excellently modelled & sound great too. In fact, all the sound work in the game is top notch.- The co driver & his pace notes. I'm so glad they got an actual navigator to read out the notes for each stage, as they sound so much more natural and the timing is mostly spot on. There are a few late calls that can cause some panic moments here & there, but you learn to drive around them. That's part of rallying and overall they've done a fantastic job.- The daily, weekly & monthly events. These help to change it up a little & add a fair bit of pressure to race fast & clean, as there are no restarts - you spin, no rewinds or restarts. You write off the car, you're done, that's it. The wager events add to this immensely, with the opportunity to get good money if you drive well but lose even bigger if you don't. Absolutely love it!If you're a rally fan or even just a driving game fan or car enthusiast, pick this one up. It's worth every cent at full price, and then some.			",34,5,10,3,3,0,6

												I recently treated myself and bought a G29 wheel to play Assetto Corsa as I loved the game so much and really wanted to improve the experience (and my rather sluggish Nordschleife times!). I could not believe the level to which the game (and my driving abilities) were improved with a decent quality force feedback wheel and pedals. I siwtched to manual gears. Assists were drastically reduced. It was remarkable.So I dumped some money on DIRT Rally, as I love the genre and thrill of the sport. Sadly the market has been so quiet for a few years so I've had to be sated with the occasional forays back to the terrifying realism that is Richard Burns (RIP).  But loading up DIRT Rally? Wow! The immersion provided with decent peripherals take the whole driving genre to a new level. The quality of the force feedback the game provides and control of the cars is something else entirely. Pushing a twitching Renault 5 turbo over an ice patch on Monte Carlo rally and feeling the steering go light as you try and rescue the car before you hit the wall is heart-stopping. Pikes Peak in a rainstorm?! The feeling of total control and knowledge of the grip that is on offer at each corner of the car. The butt-clenching feeling of helplessness as you've overcooked that ""Left 4"" in the forest, or desperately hanging on to the wheel over that sequence of terrifying Finland jumps knowing you need to claw back a few tenths but may may well be destroyed in the process of trying. I've played rally games since the dark ages, but none has hit me like this since the original Colin McRae. This game really is incredible. But it's real. It feels real. It looks utterly amazing. The sound is spot on (to anyone that doesn't have a garage full of Group B cars, at least). The co-driver is faultless. The differentiation in feel and driving techniques needed in the variety of cars and surfaces is truly humbling. And the main thing is this: every corner you ace, every yump you spot perfectly? That was you. Proper goosebump stuff - Truly an incredible game. Play this, poop your pants, say ""Thank Goodness it's just a game - a terrifying and utterly immersive game""... then go watch a Youtube link of Colin in the woods  and realise that people actually do this!

								I'm not really a sim person (I played this game with a gamepad), but I always liked rally games. I thought Dirt 3 was cool, Dirt Showdown was meh, but this...This is beyond awesome. Like others have said it before: This is Dark Souls with wheels.			",148,40,5,28,10,0,14

												Achievements earned in my first 30 minutes...-Buy a rally car-Hire an engineer-Choose a livery-Wreck your rally car so badly it ends your race :)Having just come off Dirt 3 Complete, I found Dirt Rally feels like the 'grown up' version of the series.In every sense an evolution, graphically, atmospherically and in terms of general content, it captures the feeling of 'real' rally driving like no game I've ever played.Also, if you shop around, you'll find it online for £18 like I did!

								From playing this for only 5 hours and a bit, I'm completely deaf from the very loud engine noises. And yes I did try and turn the sound down but it made no difference at all. Jokes aside, this the most realistic driving/racing game that I have ever played, and I've played a fair few. Everything on the car is a moving piece and on some cars you can even see the engine running through the boot. It's just little details like that that make a good game. 10/10 would go deaf again.

												Overall a very good game and I'm having a blast playing it. It isn't a ""sim"" as much as people say it is because of a few ""things"". It is difficult to say where that game sits as it seems to be based on a hardcore sim idea, but with a less sim-like finish to make it accessible. Still, it will give you a hard time and will require a lot of dedication to stop crashing into trees and rocks.There is no real modern competition and it is still one of the best driving games so far. You won't regret your purchase.Detail:Pros:- The UI is clean and works properly- Good controller support and user-friendly settings- Very good co-pilot, his voice changes according to your speed and doesn't sound robotic at all.- Visual damage is excellent- Driving like a rally driver pays off, pacenotes are crucial- Physics compared to the game's direct competition, though they aren't perfect (see cons)- Each car has its own specific behaviour- Engine sounds are good- Career mode serves a purpose- Daily events - despite giving pretty lame rewards IMO- Excellent optimisation: Very good graphics with pretty low requirements.Cons:- The co-pilot isn't consistent through locations. In Germany, his calls are too late so you end up braking too late, and in Finland it is the exact opposite. I shouldn't have to change how early I want the calls to be every time I enter a different location.- Physics to a certain extent. Yes, they might be the current best ones for a rally game, but you can still feel that they are a bit Grid Autosport-ish, especially on tarmac. Cars overall have too much grip on gravel, and not enough on tarmac. Mid-engined cars pendulum effect is exaggerated and the 208PP just gives me cancer as it oversteers all over the place at high speed.- Failures: Yes, you do have punctures but hitting a tree at 60mph won't damage your car to a point where it is a simple DNF. You can hit rocks at 90mph, your car will go on. Richard Burns Rally was much more punishing on this, and I'm disappointed there is no slider to choose how punishing crashes should be.- Career mode to unlock cars' real stats is silly, to be polite. I guess they needed to justify the career, but still I don't know why the f*** I should have 220bhp on my WRC until I have enough mileage to unlock its real 300bhp.- No tire selection.

								Good graphics, good sounds, very nice core game here. 2 issues that are serious for wheel users, read below.So far im impressed with the direction Codies have taken making a more realistic rally game because im the type of customer who bought one or two Dirt games in the past and then stopped because i wanted more realism. What they need to sort out/improve is the FFB (Force Feed Back) and deadzone for wheel users. The FFB is kinda like in typical Codemasters games where there isnt enough information coming through. Heavyness and vibrations isnt enough for a sim/simcade and its not enough for people with good wheels/pedals. There is also a rather large deadzone, but it hasnt bothered me too much so far. Both issues can be tweaked a bit. People have come up with XML tweaks to make the FFB better for example. Still far from good, but better. However its hard for people coming from titles like Assetto Corsa where the FFB is great, and so far Dirt Rally has quite a bit to go before it gets anywhere near Assetto Corsa quality FFB. Personally i dont need that good FFB to enjoy Dirt Rally, but it needs to get better. From what ive seen i think Codies will try improve the FFB. At least i hope so.Real review coming later when Codies have gotten further with Dirt Rally - Early Access. Would i recommend it now? I think yes. But only if you are ok with FFB not being very good yet, and you got money to spend on a WIP game in development. The core game here is great. The stages/cars looks great and the physics feel pretty darn good, and there is no typical Dirt coolness to menues or the rallying itself - its a much more mature/realistic rally game that is harder and more realistic than the usual Dirt series (the discussion board is filled with the typical ""Dirt"" clientel that asks to make it easier - lol). With FFB improvements and less deadzone this will be very nice if they keep it the way it is.I have to add something. Ive read about people saying the performance is bad in Dirt Rally - Early Access. So far i havent experienced that on my humble machine. I run most on HIGH with a few settings on MEDIUM. Textures and all the juicy stuff is on HIGH and i run it on 1920x1080 with - so far - no performance problems at all. Its super fluid at 60FPS constantly. I havent tested all combos yet so that might change, but so far so good. Specs:AMD FX 8350 8core @ 4.2GHZ - Nvidia GTX660 2GB - 8GB RAM.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Initial impressions - Early Access - 28/04/2015For a long time there has been a niche in the racing game market for a proper rally simulator, which has not been filled properly since Richard Burns Rally. Codemasters think they have a solution in DiRT Rally, which marks a strong departure from the 'arcade' feel of previous DiRT releases.This review covers the current (April 2015) Early Release version of the game. It is split into four sections, the first dealing with aesthetics, the second with video, the third with audio and the fourth with gameplay. I've listed pros, cons and tips/suggestions for improvement.The aesthetics:Pros: Minimalist theme, logical and intuitive menu navigation designCons/suggestions: A dark 'theme' option for the menu would be great for tired eyes, more options could/should be made available for areas like the HUD. Specifically on the weather, perhaps there should be a system where the seasons, time and weather conditions can be set independently, as at the moment there are only presets.Aesthetics rating: 7/10The video/graphics:Pros: A refined engine which doesn't overstress the system, fantastic attention to detail and good texture resolutions. Harsh weather means genuinely poor visibilityCons/suggestions: The game appears to be using the existing game engineVideo/graphics rating: 7/10The audio:Pros: Adds so much to the immersion in each map, e.g. windscreen wipers make a noise, the sound resolution is goodCons/Suggestions: More speaker options could be usefulAudio rating: 10/10The gameplay:Pros: Rewards good driving, strongly punishes poor driving, more immersive than most games I've played. Changes in terrain are obvious but subtle enough, changes in vehicles and vehicle setup are obvious, each car feels as though it has its own personalityCons: On a couple of stages it was unclear which direction to head in even with the pacenotes, I got a graphic driver issue when I went the wrong way on one occasionSuggestions: A tutorial system for the vehicle setup would really helpGameplay rating: 7/10Overall rating: 7.75/10For an Early Release the game is in fantastic shape in my opinion. There is still a lot that can be improved but thankfully nothing fundamental. Codemasters have got the basics right with the driving, the physics and the immersion, with the audio a clear step above previous DiRT releases.Keep up the good work!			",35,2,10,0,0,0,4

												30 hrs of gameplayFirst things first dirt rally is one of those games that will make you love and hate yourself and the same time, it is very fun and enjoyable once you understand the small tricks for getting a better time anywhere. All though if you are really grinding the game to try and get the community delta achievements and keep messing up you will get angry. Just give up for the night and try some other time. Dirt rally was one of those games that I played for about 3 hours at first then got bored of it and left it for about 2 weeks and came back to it, Boy am I glad I did .  I absolute love this game. Became really addicting and fun. Even just doing a Hotseat type game with my friends was really fun and we had a great laugh.Tips for beginning 
 learn the basics I.e. Callouts, difference between FWD, RWD, 4WD The Scandinavian flick is extremely useful (shifting the cars weight in the opposite direction of a upcoming corner and flick into it, to gain a faster speed exiting the corner) don’t worry about not coming first every time you’ll get better soon Dirt Rally comes with no bulls***, Just good and gritty driving, no drifting or story line (Colin McRae dirt 2) Overall this is the best ""Dirt"" that i have played (I have played Dirt 2, Dirt 3, Dirt rally) In fact this is the best driving game i have played to date.I would highly recommend this game.  9 /10 (some small bug fixes needed)Specs 16 GB ram i5 4690K970 Ti This game does not take that much to run but needs high specs for ultra-high graphics.This game is hard to play with a keyboard, a controller or steering wheel is a lot easier. There is no rewinds (dirt 2) restarting a Stage cost ingame money50 hrs of gameplay Listen to your co-driver.The reason for co-driver calls is to describe the road ahead so that despite having not driven the stage before you can confidently attack the stage. Listening to the calls gives you a mental picture of the road ahead allowing you to approach corners with an understanding of the challenges they will present. Timing is crucial and in Dirt Rally.Scenery can be distracting if you’re speeding round a corner in the Greek hills with near death cliffs and the co-driver calls “right 3, Don’t cut” but it looks like a “right 5, cut “don’t go with your perception of the course listen to him he will give you an advantage overall if you learn how to control the car over all terrain and in all corner type situations This diagram can help with corner call outs  Corner callout guide  [blog.codemasters.com]Have recently returned home from a 2 month holiday to find Dirt has been updated for VR and with this update there is a bug denying any actions after the loading screen and sometimes crashing the game, game is unplayable at the current moment 9 Aug..

												DIRT Rally is racing game developed by Codemasters and released in 2015. It differs from usual Dirt or other racing series by Codemasters, which are acrades with some flavour in it. DIRT Rally is intense, precise and rewarding Rally game with big ""R"" in front of it.Pros:satisfying driving engine with perfect balance between simulation and arcade. It gives you that ""WoW I did it"" feeling when you nail the stagegreat feel of cars and stages. RWD, FWD and 4WD cars act like they suppose to dogood track design and picks of various locations (Greece, Finland, Germany, Monte Carlo (Monaco), Wales, Sweden)decent amount of activities: carrer, online play, custom racingdecent amount of rally classes and carsdecent controller and FFB settingsdifficulty of AI opponents are thoughtfully set to create nice entry for beginners and give challenge to veterans laternice looking graphics, decent car models and texturesnot so bad rally school, but one from Richards Burns Rally was implemented much betterSteam workshop intergrationAverage:Rallycross and hillclimb of Pikes Peak. Those two feel like were added just to have them. I'm not fan how those were implement and I'd like to see another country added to rally stages to increase limited number of tracks instead of those two. Why we can't have rallycross cars added as rally cars to F2 Kit Car class? online racing is great fun, but I'd like to see community split into leagues by skill or some sort of management from developerCons:limited number of tracks makes racing very repetetive fast. Within few hours you start getting a feeling that you already drove it and know that stage. It also creates other problem: in online racing you have to learn tracks by heart to get best scores. It should be more about learning car, not muscle memory by driving over and over again on same track. There is a hope in Dirt 4, that randomly generated stages will fix that problem.lighting engine could be improved. Models, texture and design are good, but that one part is clearly lackingit's not a sim: so damage model is very forgiving, night isn't fully dark, you cannot chose tiressome rally classes are lacking and could use more carsvery limited moddability. New cars, tracks and modes would improve game a lotSteam workshop item limit set to 100Some performance issues on few Germany stagesIn the end DIRT Rally is great rally game and we need more games like DIRT Rally. It has that ""feel"" of racing and guys responsible for it should have a beer.I highly recommend it to veterans and beginners of rally games. Game isn't hard and open and club difficulties are for everyone. If you end up crashing often in 95% you drive too fast and in 5% don't listen to co-driver. Famous rally quotes: ""Slow is smooth, smooth is fast."" and ""In like a lamb, out like a lion."" work here perfectly.			",281,74,8,44,69,2,78

								TL;DR Review: Essentially, it's the Dark Souls of racing games.Full Review: I can happily max everything out on my system at 5120x1200 and it looks fantastic, both while driving and in the replays (i5 3570K & R9 280X). It's also challenging, in that thrilling way that is genuinely rewarding when you get it right. DiRT Rally is absolutely the best racing game I have played in a very long time. I am not a hardcore racer (not even close), but there seem to be a lot of reviews saying it is purely a sim or that you should only play if you have a fancy wheel. While it does feel like there is a lot for the sim-heads, to me it feels very approachable using an Xbox pad, and that's without all of the assists turned on. As long as you are prepared to try and fail, there is a lot of fun to be had from this game no matter what your previous experience is. If you like to be out in front and coasting all the time, then maybe this isn't for you. If you like to push yourself to the limits, get DiRT.			",163,51,22,24,23,2,26

								I have to go ALL THE WAY BACK to 1987 to Accolade's Test Drive for the Amiga--the last time I was hopelessly addicted to a driving game.  Of course, the former is laughable by any measure nowadays, and I can only wonder if we'll laugh at today's racing games 30 years from now pondering how we found a title to be quite this amazing.  Dirt Rally has an incredibly replayable, difficult, and addictive nature to it.  I will find myself playing ""just one more stage"" again and again, and it has become my go-to game.  I highly recommend a controller (or driving controls...just not a keyboard/mouse) as the analog inputs are very much needed.  Dirt Rally is much more a simulation and a challenging one, which makes the realism seem much higher than your typical driving game.  It has three modes currently--rally (my favorite), hill climb, and a circuit against other vehicles (ai or pvp).  Each is unique and takes time to master.  I have yet to master the latter even at a basic level.  Additionally, there are daily, weekly, monthly, and league challenges in addition to 5 difficulty levels (of which I have seen just two in 60+ hours of gameplay).I cannot recommend this game highly enough!!  The best part is that since they are still in early access, they continue adding new features, tracks, and cars, while fine-tuning what they already have.			",191,44,10,18,18,2,18

								Dirt: Rally brings back what made the Colin Mcrae series what it was in the 90's and early 2000's. It provides a semi-simulation feel that lets it sit with other more serious racing games without becoming inaccessible to those looking for a fun rally game.Plays great on a controller, but probably would demand a wheel for those looking to get most out of it.Presentation is outstanding with great graphics and sound that emulate the aesthetics and grit a rally event should. The attention to detail is really appreciated. Replay:

								Always used to love the old racing games.One of my early gaming memories is playing against my dad on Total Drivin'. Things have come a long way since then but I've always loved off track racing games. Dirt3 was good but then I had to go through the nightmare that is gymkhana.This game is unforgiving and has a brutal learning curve. Expecting to drift around a corner at full speed? Not going to happen. Rewind back to your mistake and fix it? Not anymore.For tyre kickers like myself it has been a hard slog to the finish, with many a restart and curse in between.

I dont recommend keyboard & mouse as you need fully control of your car around these norrow roads.Cockpit view looks fantastic with a detailed dashboard... what else can you ask for? it feels like racing rally!well done to codemasters !!

								All the fun of the fair, so long as the fair offers great rally cars from the 60's on through to modern times.  Some great memories, satisfying handling and effort to realism on top of some really good looking graphics at the higher settings.Currently monthly released expansion packs with updates/fixes at the same time or in between.  Would buy again :)			",69,3,4,2,6,0,4

								Dirt Rally is by far the best Stage rally game released to date, it is also the only rally simulator around, and the rest tend to be just arcade games. Love the accuracy of stages such as Sweet Lamb, unlike in games such as WRC 4. I think it is great that all the older cars are in it, but I don’t think that as much time has been put into the post 2010 cars. As a rally driver in Britain (fingers crossed Europe soon) and one of the first privateers to receive the new Ford Fiesta R2T kit, it would really appeal to me to see some modern 2WD cars such as a the DS3 R3, Fiesta R2 and 208 R2. It has been announced that Rally Germany and Pikes Peak will be released but haven’t read that new cars will. I just hope the FIA isn’t in full control of the rights to using these cars in games. The game is really only playable on a wheel as I said it’s more a simulator game, but if you are committed enough you will get to grips with keys. This game is a must buy for any motorsport fan, well priced and can’t wait for the DLC and updates. If you are a supporter of rallying buying it at this stage will show commitment and improve the game even more.			",1,0,2,2,4,0,2

								DiRT goes back to the good old days and scraps the whole ""Dudebro"" stuff like Gymkhana and focuses purely on rally. No seriously, this game is all about rally. Even in it's early access stage it gets updated and doesn't feel lacking in content. The physics are great, the graphics are good and most importantly, the gameplay is superb. Even though it is still in early access and there is more content to come, DiRT Rally is the best rally sim that I have played in my life.			",133,4,12,8,4,2,3

												When this launched in early access I was taken back to a time when Dirt games (Colin McRae) were simulators not wannabe arcade games.  Sure the game was minimal in tracks and cars but it showed the intent of the dev team perfectly.  This is the game we want to make now, are you guys in or not?Well yeah, I was in.. did they come true on their promises?  Yes, all of them IMO and then some.For an early access game to support force feedback wheels, that's good but kinda necessary for a racing simulator.  For it also to support TrackIR for headlook and my HD3D monitor is awesome and it looked amazing.Fast forward god knows how many months and the games been launched and now the VR patch has dropped.  It was a hefty update but I'm very happy to say it just worked.  Launch game, bam it's running on the Rift.  So TrackIR sold, HD3D no longer necessary.This is the rally game you've been waiting for; if you've just got a joypad... jump right in it's perfectly playable.  If you've got an FFB you're in for a treat; if you've got VR you're in for an even bigger treat especially on the wet stages, bloody rain!tl;drThis is not an arcade game though, it will require a decent investment of time to get good.  8 hours or so into playing it and er... well I still suck.  Now the Rift patch has dropped though I can start investing more time; this is what I've been waiting for.This game has the developer support, the peripheral/accessory support, tracks you'll love to hate, the cars you want to drive and the ongoing online challenges you want, it has a good single player mode with multi stage races, car damage with correct time scales to repair the car between stages.

												Linux version, openSUSE/LeapThis game is 2 in 1 - probably the best racing game I have ever played in addition to the best port of a graphics intensive game to Linux I have seen. This game feels so real in mechanics compared to the physical laws of driving of a car, and just lacking only the human sense of the gravity factor. Astoundingly I can run it on High settings 1920x1080, no lags,  on an extremely ancient hardware with Intel Core2Duo - twice bellow  the minimum requirements for CPU speed,  and low-end Nvidia GTX700 series video card.

												Dirt Rally is a sensory masterpeice.  The sounds are amazing, every nuance you would hear in car and outside are perfect.  Graphics are well done, few sims racers can capture the atmosphere of the place they are representing.  Game play, though hard at times, and some have said impossible, is very rewarding when you run a clean stage.  This is not a game for first time sim racers, nor should you be playing Need for Speed and expect to beat the game, or work up the leaderboards quickly.  It takes paitence, and time.  Drive slow and steady, the speed will come.			",6,0,11,1,6,0,0

								It means something when u become a car lover from a game. This game is awesome! Free dlc! Awesome new parkours and modes! Compatible with almost every wheel! And the graphics and design of how you can play the game is just in and out awesome! I recommend this game alot. At first its hard especially if you have a keyboard like me (Thinking of buying a wheel). But at some moment u get the hang of it and find your car that makes you win the game, It doesnt matter if your not the competitive type of person because you will always get rewarded for atleast trying to win the race. You have daily,weekly,and monthly races where you can earn some extra cash by racing on a special mode for example: Playing on night mode with an Toyota Celica on a dirt map. The game offers a wide expansion of trying to win the race by learning your mistakes and trying to win over and over again. a must buy!			",120,11,6,14,12,0,9

												The codemasters rally game everyone has waited for. Since DiRT took to energy drinks and gymkhana........A true homage to Colin McCrae Rally!!! Dare i say the best rally game to date on all formats?.....HELL YEAH! This game ticks ALL the boxes. Great engine, great handling, nice graphics, true rally gameplay in fact i honestly cant think of anything bad to  say......the menu musics not to my taste, but i usually turn it off anyway. For those unfirmiliar to the series, its a great rally game. It can be very unforgiving, but thats the point with rally. One mistake and you've killed your car! The rally cross and different classes give enough variation but dont expect gymkhana or powersliding for points, its more simulation than arcade.Sound 10/10Graphics 9/10gameplay 9/10 (will possibly rise to 9.5/10 depending on content to come.)Overall 9/10BEST RALLY GAME ON ALL FORMATS EVER!!!!!!!!!  Colin is finally smiling down on codemasters again!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Great game! Finally a game that challenges you to the max!The game is in early acces but the build is really stable! Haven't had any trouble so far. It's a real challenge to drive fast and control your car in tight corners .. To much steering results into a crash so you really have to be carefull with your controls!But after 30 mins or so you'll get the hang of it!If you want to beat the n1 time on a stage you'll have to drive very fast , so fast that you crash almost everytime you take corners, your heart will definently pump faster!! The car  handles as it's supposed to: Real and not arcade-ishCan't wait to see more cars and tracks added to this!!Cons:- Realistic car handling- No gymkhana/arcade gameplay- Challenging from the start !!- Amazing sound engine- Game is made because the community wanted it- Devs listen to their fans- Realistic weather/terain- Beautifull graphics- Easy to run on almost every pc- More content to come!Pro's:- Hard to control- colin mcrae's name is not on the box :(((			",89,7,3,5,10,0,0

												Linux-specific part: Rally runs really well for me under Arch. I got a big scary warning at first launch that my OS was unsupported but I've had absolutely no problems.The game itself is great. This is definitely more of a simulation than DiRT 3 / Showdown was, which I like. There are upgrades and tuning of the usual things (brake balance, diff strength, suspension), but they aren't the focal point. The focal point is fast-paced blind driving with little room for error.I've had a lot of fun playing this game, and I'm very happy with its Linux port.			",92,4,4,4,11,1,16

								Wow. Just wow.This game doesn't hold your hand, it kicks you in the ♥♥♥, makes you fall into the DiRT and kicks you while you're down.It's awesome. Too many games these days play themselves, all you need to do is press a few buttons. This game requires skill, theres not stupid Ken Block BS or gymkhana. This is what happens when develops LISTEN to the fans, and gives them what they want. If you enjoyed the rally games of old, you'll LOVE this!I do think the price is a tiny bit high (40NZD) i believe 25 NZD would be a bit more reasonable, however this game doesn't feel early access at all.You won't regret it if you purchase this game!

												Colin McRae Rally is back! The most reasistic rally-driving experience you can get today (on PC at least). Since Richard Burns Rally came out a decade ago (if you remember it, like I do, i'm sorry, but we're too old to play videogames anyway), this is a must have if you want to enjoy an authentic sim without Ken Block, bright colours and stunts. The game might seem easy at first, but it all changes when you try the fast cars - they are unbelievable. And yes, the wheel is recommended. Tried playing with an Xbox One controller, it is bearable, but your driving reflexes don't work with controller sticks as well as they would with a proper wheel and pedals, like when you get sudden oversteer, for example. Overall an amazing piece, with Classic rally, Hillclimb, and Rallycross, all our favourite disciplines.I'll see you at the start of the Special Stage.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A pure simulation that dumps you in a deap ditch wanting to improve yourself.Dont confuse this with the previous somewhat arcade dirt games ,its a brutal ,bumpy,difficult heart pounding simulation and not for the impatient.LIke in 2.0 you have to fix your car within the alotted time with the best team you can afford inbetween races.The sense of realism in the cockpit/dash views is immense together with amasing realistic sounds and damage coadmasters are creating something really special here.

Painful dude. Painful.So, if you want to win you have to take some risks, right ?!.And that ♥♥♥♥ing risks will put you in a ♥♥♥♥ing tree ! Or offroad (but real offroad, that kind of offroad where you can't get back unless you use a ""teleportation"" which mean that you will loose some times).You have to be really focus, concentrate, under pression, and that's real rally my friends, I love it.One mistake and boom ♥♥♥♥♥ you are out.Bref, I played DIRT Rally, I love it with pain and I recommand it !!!

								Its been a good year, raceroom racings picked up their game, pcars has come out, Assetto corsa is getting its act together. And then this game..... Just out of nowhere comes this... almost apology of a title, apologising for all that Ken Block gymkhana drivel they've been forcing down our throat for years. Not to mention that showdown game *shudders*.I say almost, because what this game is, is a love letter from codemasters, its saying hey, im sorry and im still the person i was when you fell in love with me all those years ago, we still have that spark to make amazing captivating racing, and want you back.Thank you Codemasters, thank you very much I've missed you and i still love you too.Love,Dig			",206,4,19,19,9,0,25

												Excellent Rally Game. Equal or maybe even better then original Colin McRae Rally 1+2I highly recommend this game if you are into Rally. DiRT Rally is brutal, back to basics Rally driving. With an emphasis on brutal. Get ready for some practice laps.Best enjoyed using a steering wheel, or at least a gamepad. Unplayable with M/KB.Requirements:- Nerves of steel- 101% focus on drivingRewards:- Pure adrenaline- A true rally experience- Unparallelled feeling of success after finally beating a best time			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								One of those games that <insert censored word> you 'till you love it. The first few attempts I didn't finish because the game has a damage model that you cannot disable, so now playing pinball around the corners. In spite of the DiRT name, no Circus, no overhpyed coolness, just a plain and simple Rally game. You don't get magic repairs, after two stages your crew is allowed to spend half an hour patching you up with duct tape and chewing gum, and damage persists over the whole course.Roads have a realistic feel, and most of all, a realistic width - you don't drive on six lane highways. I suppose the hardcore fans will miss more setup options than the ten or so settings you can change, but that is fine with me.  More Gran Turismo type parts would have been nice too. If there is anything negative I can say about the game, I'd say there aren't enough locations, but then, this is Early Access so this is perfectly okay. Please bring back Kenya :)I have no problem recommending this game. I'm curious what is still planned for it.			",193,17,10,22,16,0,39

												0/10 - Because review scores are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tCodies latest rally sim is exactly that, a proper sim... for the most part.The cars are mostly from DiRT 3 with a few extra cars thrown in but they were chosen in DiRT 3 for a reason and they all seem in place here.I do club rallying myself and D.R is exactly that, it's basically racing old WRC cars in semi-pro events that somehow pay major dollars, you end up doing the same stages over and over again so I recommend playing this game about once every two weeks rather than just sitting down and playing the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game.The stages are really 6 locations with 2 massives stages cut up into pieces, now, in a club rally we do this all the time but even then in real life the stages are all 20km long. D.R feels like a rallysprint but this also allows a few more people to complete events. The monthly challenges can be up to 2 hours long - That's a regular rally on a Saturday night for most real drivers.The game itself is graphically lovely, the physics are insane and show just how good Codies can make games.But nothing can replicate the amazing terror of throwing yourself through a dark forrest on a logging trail that was only driven on the last time you had a rally there. (and I'd love for Codies to come to Australia and make you sim racers have a go at some of our stages)This was plainly thrown together to get a CMR style title back into the mainstream press and now that it's released the 2nd game will most definitely be a WRC game with a car and stage list to make you think back to the old CMR days, Having some old oddities of cars would make a nice addition to the seemingly standard car list that lands in every rally game.Beast of a game that punishes you for mistakes.

												I have such nostalgia for Lancia. Every time it comes back in a daily I'm reminded of their RELENTLESS performance (not my words, check wikipedia) at the 1973 Monte Carlo Rally. I knew right then and there that they were future WRC material, despite the fact that the mid-engined Stratos wasn't even built yet.I'd reckon it was a good 15 years before they hit their prime, at the 1987 World Rally Championship. To think that they also won the WRC before then in an underpowered Stratos is simply incredible. IMO that was the greatest single season performance by a car in WRC history, the kind of thing that puts Renault, Citroën, Audi and Subaru all to shame.It's absolutely pathetic that the team was never picked up over a powerhouse brand like Fiat. They would've put Volkswagen in their place and pounded their stage times, just like they've done to rivals every year. With such prowess, I can only assume that Fiat made them an offer and, being the true Italians they are, Lancia decided they'd rather rebuild their ailing childhood heroes.Nonetheless, I would expect big things from Lancia in this game. Dirt Rally is a real CHASSIS game and I'd bet Lancia has the best one in any category. Nothing short of a top 5 in stage WRs would be acceptable. For the monthly rally, a victory is on the cards for sure. Just look at the stats. 4wd won every WRC event from the 80s onwards except against the Lancia 037, to which the Quattro lost once. Lancia got in Audi's head, got that PSYCHOLOGICAL advantage, and will blow the FRs out of the water when they go wheel to wheel. They're gonna be gunning for the win, I'm sure of it. Honestly, the only question I have about this game is whether you can handle driving a REAL RALLY CAR.			",159,9,33,10,21,1,36

								""The Dark Souls of Rally games.""This statement is bang on, this game is incredibly hard... but the moment you nail a hairpin right 40ft up a mountain at terrifying speed, it all becomes worth it. This is not an arcade game, this is more sim than anything else. The DiRT in the title is all that this game has taken from the previous games in the series. DiRT Rally IS hardcore, but it is incredibly fun to play and is very well optimised to boot... I am running it in eyefinity 3x1 at a resolution of 5760x1080 on an FX8350/R9 290 on ultra settings and it runs extremely well, 50/60+fps with no AA, 40/50fps with AA on.There's a lot of content too, 3 different countries with many different courses and a really nice selection of cars ranging from the 60's to present day.and the great part? It's not even finished yet...If you're a Rally fan or even driving games in general but don't mind putting the work in... Buy this.10/10 would have heart attack again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In DiRT Rally your co-driver has a second voice he uses sometimes. It's a quiet voice, used when the engine is silent when you have just slid off into a briar patch, a certain tone that says: ""I'm being a professional about this, but you just messed up."" The agony of failure and the triumph of victory has always been the appeal of great rally games and DiRT Rally is a throwback to the greats.There's a bit of differing opinion in reviews because of the inevitable comparison to Richard Burns Rally. If you are coming from RBR then these cars are going to feel too forgiving and too easy to control. If you haven't played RBR then DiRT Rally""s cars will impress you with their difficulty and unforgiving disposition.It's DiRT's championships that are truly difficult it's completing the stage fast enough to win that requires lots of practice.  It's focused on gameplay rather than physics like RBR but it is still the best physics sim outside of RBRSound design is jaw dropping.Stages are amazingly detailed and varied.No, this is not the same as RBR but what it is instead is the rally game that everyone has been waiting for, in fact, the best rally game ever.

												Where to Start.This game is probably the most realistic ""Rally"" Simulator currently released. The game is quite hard to just sit down and pick up. Trust me, you will be in the hedge quicker than colin mcrae can say ""If in Doubt, flat out"". The game starts you off in career only being able to afford 2 cars, and here on out the only way to buy better cars is to win events. Sounds easy? Well, You need to take into account paying for your crew. They have a limited amount of use throughout the events, if you dont have a decent crew or pay for a cheap crew, less work will be done to the car in your half an hour slot. Overall, the graphics are good, sound is awesome to me. The cars generally sound powerful. Also, it has pikes peak. Recreated and looks fantastic.I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a challenge and likes rally games. I would recommend at the minimum some sort of controller for gameplay, but a steering wheel for the best effect.5/5!			",43,2,3,1,4,1,0

												This game is simply brilliant , it manages to wipe the floor with all racing games currently on steam due to its addictive and intense gameplay.The physics are realistic and are challenging to the player , which makes the game feel more rewarding. The graphics are great , and audio is realistic too , each car has realistic engine sounds . This is a big problem in most racing games nowdays , however Codemasters seem to have got it spot on in the Dirt series , and you wont be dissapointed by this new addition to the family. New content gets released regurlarly , such as cars , new game modes and tracks. The most recent addition is the Rallycross update, which adds a few tracks and around 6 cars to tear up the track with, the most fun in this game mode probably would be online because of its fast paced nature , but is also amazing in singleplayer. Other game modes such as Hillclimb on Pikes Peak and Rally also are outstanding.There are many types of cars such as , 60s , 70s , 80 RWD, Group B , Group A , 2010s and more . Many fan favourites are in this game too (Lancia Delta Integrale , Audi Quattro rally and hillclimb , Lancia Stratos , S4 , Metro , Ford Fiesta ect) Pros:-Realistic Physics-New Content Gets released regurlarly-Audio and Graphics spot on-Good selection of online events and competitions which happen on a daily basis with big prizes-Rallycross even has the Joker rule!!Cons:-Some car classes do not have as much cars as others . (Early Access though.)Final Verdict:There is so much fun to be had in this great game , if you love motorsports definetley get this. However , may be challenging for newer players to the simulation racing genre.9/10 MUST BUY			",118,7,9,5,4,0,0

Early Access Review
								TL;DRIf you scroll down the reviews far enough to read this, I have one question for you:""What are you doing? JUST BUY THE GAME!""Ahem, right. Now there is a new update, version 0.9 early this November that adds a number of cars and updated the drive physics.For the better, of course.I can't belive how sensical things have become. Mind you, I'm not very good in this game, and despite plunging in the game quite early, I don't play it as much as others because of one thing, RageQuits. And being angry playing this game is a good thing. Bear with me.This is the most realistic driving simulation I have ever played. I heard news about Dirt Rally being released on Early Access from a popular image sharing in the interweb (not Instagram). I learned it's going to be true rally sim unlike those useless gymkhana stunts on previous DiRTs I never got the hang on after many hours.I was excited to read rave early reviews saying how it was going to exceed all previous iterations of Codemaster's DiRT games AND even Richard Burn Rally, the pinacle of Rally games. I tried RBR once, it was a pain to install, with all the necessary mods that took ages to download, and I didn't like the graphics, I didn't like the feels. The practice on that game alone was ridiculous hard and unrealistic. It didn't have support for my Logitech G27 and I won't waste my time getting my wheel working on a game that allows a car to slide around in gravel at 30kph. I played Shift 2 since, and became quite confident with my skills. I tried pCars after that, the physics was similar though I wouldn't say I'm happy with how cars handles. But DiRT Rally is something else. It's out of this world. No, seriously. THIS is the holy grail.It is Early Access, already in v0.9, but you got a fully functioning, mostly bug-free game that runs like a good completed game of the old days. Remember the times when we use DVDs to install games and we can play that game smoothly and comfortably right after installing it, without any Day 1 patches? That's how good Dirt Rally runs out of the box. Sure there is occasional bugs and hastles, but with each iteration it's mostly fixed and if the game hangs on you, perhaps it's about time to take a rest and wash your face. You've probably driven more than 100km in one sitting.Whatever price you pay for this game, it's worth it. You are essentially paying for a complete game that runs superbly well and in each month, there is a massive update giving players new features, new cars, and new game modes (probably). Think of it like buying a complete Rally game and earning free DLCs along the way. YEAH!So I dusted my olde G27 and hooked it up to my new gaming PC, built around this game!Bought my first Mini and hopped into the car.And man, I did fell off a cliff.Those reviewers before me are not joking.This is the real thing. This is the S-word-I'm-not-allowed-to-say. This justifies my new $1500 gaming rig. What you get is punishing Rally game that is as close to the real thing as it can be. There isn't any other game like this and sadly, I don't think there will be any other after this. RBR survived a decade for a reason. The masochists that we all are did not have anything else to channel our needs.DiRT Rally gives that in a beautiful and accessible way. No, you won't have to install mods and spend wasteful hours setting up your gears. Plug in a steering wheel and start driving.Even better now is the new RallyCross pack.That is the Holy S-word-I'm-not-allowed-to-say Fun I ever had. You are inside a jet engine that accelerated like a rocket and turns in four wheel against other cute rockets. Cute rockets that wants to end your Monday like a goat with murder tendency.Your opponents, the AIs, are sick enough to butt you, slam you off your lane, ram your back, flick your tail and send you to a separator, destorying your radiator. They are violent and I like them violent. It gave me a reason to be just as violent.The tracks are simple enough. When you first started RallyCross, it was just a simple oval with the trickiest bit being the joker. Now I don't know what that is at first and I hope the Devs would take some time making an in-game Encyclopedia for every rally terms in the game, but basically, it was a speed bump everybody had to take once. As you got better, the track got longer and more complicated, and boy, you will soon learn your limits and you will get addicted to want to break those limits.Now, the new November update completed drive physics for each car. I currently drove a Quattro, not the best car, I know, but I'm comfortable with it. The ride was stable enough and I'm never going too fast to my taste. But the new update makes me realise that it was actually weird going so stable around Wales in the rain, plunging through dips without my car bouncing about and hitting the trees, because that's what happens afte the update!Is that a bad thing? Of course not. It threw me off balance, and I have to re-learn the car again, but thinking back, it's probably how it should handle. You're going over 100 on mud anyway, how could it possible you're going straight with the throttle hammered down? That's what I love about this game and the team at CodeMasters who are responsible with its development. They worked very hard to make sure every detail makes sense. It might not be a perfect sim, I don't have a reference point because I don't do real world rally. But playing this game also makes me a better driver in the real world. You know, I kinda feel it when I could slid the tail of my car, it just takes a little nudge up the handbrake, just a little bit and I'm skidding, but no, won't risk it.Because just as in DiRT Rally, you don't perform risky manuevuer to show off. You aim to deliver the car across the finish line. Sloppiness and the urge to try something stupid, like ignoring your navigator will send you crashing, and more often than not, going slower does make you go faster.This is the game to buy if you are a masochist perfectionist.

								""The Dark Souls of Rally games.""This statement is bang on, this game is incredibly hard... but the moment you nail a hairpin right 40ft up a mountain at terrifying speed, it all becomes worth it. This is not an arcade game, this is more sim than anything else. The DiRT in the title is all that this game has taken from the previous games in the series. DiRT Rally IS hardcore, but it is incredibly fun to play and is very well optimised to boot... I am running it in eyefinity 3x1 at a resolution of 5760x1080 on an FX8350/R9 290 on ultra settings and it runs extremely well, 50/60+fps with no AA, 40/50fps with AA on.There's a lot of content too, 3 different countries with many different courses and a really nice selection of cars ranging from the 60's to present day.and the great part? It's not even finished yet...If you're a Rally fan or even driving games in general but don't mind putting the work in... Buy this.10/10 would have heart attack again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In DiRT Rally your co-driver has a second voice he uses sometimes. It's a quiet voice, used when the engine is silent when you have just slid off into a briar patch, a certain tone that says: ""I'm being a professional about this, but you just messed up."" The agony of failure and the triumph of victory has always been the appeal of great rally games and DiRT Rally is a throwback to the greats.There's a bit of differing opinion in reviews because of the inevitable comparison to Richard Burns Rally. If you are coming from RBR then these cars are going to feel too forgiving and too easy to control. If you haven't played RBR then DiRT Rally""s cars will impress you with their difficulty and unforgiving disposition.It's DiRT's championships that are truly difficult it's completing the stage fast enough to win that requires lots of practice.  It's focused on gameplay rather than physics like RBR but it is still the best physics sim outside of RBRSound design is jaw dropping.Stages are amazingly detailed and varied.No, this is not the same as RBR but what it is instead is the rally game that everyone has been waiting for, in fact, the best rally game ever. They knocked it out of the park.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Where to Start.This game is probably the most realistic ""Rally"" Simulator currently released. The game is quite hard to just sit down and pick up. Trust me, you will be in the hedge quicker than colin mcrae can say ""If in Doubt, flat out"". The game starts you off in career only being able to afford 2 cars, and here on out the only way to buy better cars is to win events. Sounds easy? Well, You need to take into account paying for your crew. They have a limited amount of use throughout the events, if you dont have a decent crew or pay for a cheap crew, less work will be done to the car in your half an hour slot. Overall, the graphics are good, sound is awesome to me. The cars generally sound powerful. Also, it has pikes peak. Recreated and looks fantastic.I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a challenge and likes rally games. I would recommend at the minimum some sort of controller for gameplay, but a steering wheel for the best effect.5/5!			",43,2,3,1,4,1,0

								Until now, I have never been engrossed in a sim racer because of the actual racing. Usually, my desire to collect and upgrade cars is what drives me to continue playing games like Gran Turismo, or Forza, because racing in those games can be downright boring. Not so in Dirt Rally, with which I am obsessed right now. I usually don't get infatuated with a game unless it is RPG in nature, but this game has got me hooked.The racing really gives you a feel of power because the cars feel and sound amazing, and the amount of challenge means that success is extremely rewarding. Successfully drifting through a hairpin turn gives a great feeling. Another reviewer said that this is the Dark Souls of racing, and I wholeheartedly agree. Prepare to die, a lot. If you are up for a challenge and love a good race of any kind, I strongly recommend this title.			",88,25,2,16,17,0,22

								all i can say about dirt rally is graphic so smooth, AAA weather effect and yes this game pretty hard to master thats why make this game so challenging. there is some point that really annoy me when playing in dirt rally:- Unbreakable small bushes, fences. (in some course they have unbreakable bushes / fences. in case if u crash to them ur car will badly destroy. i hope they will fix this before launch full version)- If u come to this game as a newbie at racing simulator like me. you will find really hard to make best tuning for your car coz no in-game tutorial to make best tuning. and this mean u will get long way to grinding money to buy new car. - it's fully controller support. but i can't navigate using my PS3 controller when in main menu. - no ""sell car""  option?  at least give ""sell car"" option or ""Try a car"" so people who want to buy a new car not dissapointed when they find a new car that he buy not really suit with their race style.if u love racing game especially rally. this game worth to buy.

								The most fun I've had racing since Richard Burns Rally. It's definitely a proper sim and huge improvement over the previous Dirt games. The physics, ffb, and wheel controller support are waay better. The game has steadily improved in early access and is a great example of early access done right. The devs have had a strong community presence  and have implemented feedback while continuing to put out quality content on a very consistent basis. Console owners will be in for a treat if they decide to release the final version on the PS4 and xbone. I'm very happy to see early VR support as well even though it's a rough implementation. If they continue to work on it the game should be amazing on the Oculus Rift consumer version. Overall the best driving game codemasters has ever made.			",211,37,21,13,17,0,4

												I remember my first ever stage in DiRT Rally. Coming from the realm of arcade racers is quite brutal, it's probably an eye-opening experience for anyone who is in the same position as I was. It's going to take quite a lot of time and effort to get decent at the game, you'll have to learn all the techniques the pros use: left-foot breaking, throttle feathering, scandinavian flicks, handbrake turns, counter-steering etc. You'll have to learn to feel the car, appreciate speed and traction, and listen to your co-driver's calls. It's really worth it, though. Coming first in an Open stage is going to feel amazing, then you'll want to do the same in Professionals and then Masters. The game has an awesome level of complexity, the learning curve is a bit steep, but if you like driving, it will be time you enjoy spending (apart from getting frustrated now and then) and the progress you make is quite noticeable, especially in the first few championships. Note: I really recommend buying a driving wheel for this game, otherwise you're really missing the REAL experience.

								The most fun I've had racing since Richard Burns Rally. It's definitely a proper sim and huge improvement over the previous Dirt games. The physics, ffb, and wheel controller support are waay better. The game has steadily improved in early access and is a great example of early access done right. The devs have had a strong community presence  and have implemented feedback while continuing to put out quality content on a very consistent basis. Console owners will be in for a treat if they decide to release the final version on the PS4 and xbone. I'm very happy to see early VR support as well even though it's a rough implementation. If they continue to work on it the game should be amazing on the Oculus Rift consumer version. Overall the best driving game codemasters has ever made.			",211,37,21,13,17,0,4

												I remember my first ever stage in DiRT Rally. Coming from the realm of arcade racers is quite brutal, it's probably an eye-opening experience for anyone who is in the same position as I was. It's going to take quite a lot of time and effort to get decent at the game, you'll have to learn all the techniques the pros use: left-foot breaking, throttle feathering, scandinavian flicks, handbrake turns, counter-steering etc. You'll have to learn to feel the car, appreciate speed and traction, and listen to your co-driver's calls. It's really worth it, though. Coming first in an Open stage is going to feel amazing, then you'll want to do the same in Professionals and then Masters. The game has an awesome level of complexity, the learning curve is a bit steep, but if you like driving, it will be time you enjoy spending (apart from getting frustrated now and then) and the progress you make is quite noticeable, especially in the first few championships.

								I am going to preface this review by saying that I am not good at this game. I am not good at controlling my car even with a gamepad, and god help any of you that try to play with just a mouse and keyboard. That being said I think that this is a very very good game. The physics seem accurate (at least to a filthy casual such as myself), the tracks are supposed to be accurately modeled, and the sound, my god the audio is amazing. The gameplay is challenging, and unless you are much better than me you WILL destroy your car while learning it. Overall I'd say get this game if the idea of driving a howling turbocharged shitbox down gravel roads at 90mph while bouncing off berms appeals to you. I know it appeals to me.			",90,1,3,12,2,0,25

								After almost 50 hours it's probably time to do the review. Been playing since 0.45 and have played all different classes except the 2010's. From the 1960's ""beginner cars"" to the Group B monsters, back down to Group A to the recent day this game is trying to confine 50 years of rallying in one single game. Car models are well done, physics are as good as you should (yes, should, not could) expect from a simulator game like this and the rally stage are close if not exact replica's of their real life counterparts, there's no fantasy involved.But wait, there's more...Dirt Rally also features the Pikes Peak Hillclimb and Rallycross now, which I find fun to do, but my main personal focus will stay on rally stages, but just know it's out there and it is fun. We'll see if Codemasters decides to expand on these championships with more different hillclimbs or rallycross circuits.Onto the lesser things, as the game is early access, which is sometimes - just like alpha or beta - misused to label an unfinished product that will stay unfinished, there are rough edges. However it feels genuinely early access, and not an excuse. One of things most notable are stuttering/lag issues that seem to affect Nvidia people more than AMD. No mouse support, which is weird for a 2015 game and obviously the ""limited"" (take it with a grain of salt) content available for the price of now 42 euro's (I bought it for 24 or something a few patches ago as they did mention it would increase in price overtime, which imo is a fresh attitude towards otherwhise buyable DLC's or patches).Now I'm not going to go into the discussion if 42 euro's is the correct price right now - although that is still less than let's say Project Cars or Assetto Corsa - as that depends on your budget and how hard you want this game, but I can say this game is worth playing...a lot.Cause it's a sim, it'll take time before you get all green stage times and top the leaderboards, offline or online for that matter. And that's basically the real reason why I would advice this game, it's a longterm investment in entertainment, if Codemasters keeps up the patches like they do I can see this game being in the same league as Richard Burns Rally when it comes to lifespan.And that only means good news.So, to Codemasters: please fix optimilization issues with graphics and sounds...and you have yourself a gold mine with an inspired and enthusiastic community.Nectaria Coutayar			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I purchased this game a while back as an early access and reviewed it negatively so I want to ammend that now, as the game has evolved into something I find quite enjoyable.  The realistic physics is challenging but all the more rewarding as you progress and begin to master it.  I did find it absolutely necessary to set steering sensitivity at 100%, as whatever the default setting had been was unplayable for me.  The graphics is great but not overly demanding.  In fact, it would be fully playable on even my small 13"" gaming laptop if not for the only remaining negative point.  If you're running a laptop with nVidia Optimus switchable graphics (which is almost any current nVidia-powered gaming laptop,) you cannot run the game in fullscreen!  It simply refuses to comply, even if you edit the ini file.  Apparently this has been an initial issue with previous Dirt releases as well, which makes it all the more ridiculous that they let this one out with the same problem - and that it remains a problem with this title more than a year after initial public release!!  Note, AMD's switchable graphics is not afflicted with this problem but AMD only has roughly 25% marketshare among gamers.  Even so, I give the game five stars for being one of the few real shining stars in the PC driving game category.  I'm just glad I hung onto my older AMD-powered gaming laptop to play it!!

								Dirt Rally is coming along nicely. Cars are lovely to handle (I like challenge and this almost like RBR). Graphics are good. Narrow roads on stages are big plus for me. Only thing I'm currently disappointed about is that there is not enough unique stages. Locations like Germany use same bits of roads several times through the rally. I like the work Codemasters did with the first three locations, but the Germany was a big let down stage-wise.			",43,1,4,0,8,0,3

Before you read into this, note:I do not own a wheel.However, prior to buying DiRT Rally, I had a go with my brothers set (MOMO Black, popular back in the day). The driving felt pretty comfortable. Didn't have any problems with it besides that I'm an inexperienced sim driver and sucked at it, but for that short moment I had so much fun. The feeling threw me back somewhere in time I hazily remember playing Live For Speed and sucking at that, too. But most importantly, it felt real.Seriously don't try this with keyboard ...For now, I have to make do with a controller only. Mind you, this one is so cheap it doesn't even have the analog bumpers like a ps3/4 or x360 /XO controller, but your mileage may vary (no pun intended). The settings offer full keymapping for every input type, this is great. Main input devices are keyboard, gamepad, or wheel and pedals (I guess there's no reason not to play this with a flight stick or guitar hero controller if you really wanted to.. (update: tried, guitar controller definitely works)) and basic gamepad/controller is the middleground here. Manageable, in my case. I, like many others, would recommend that you shouldn't start this game with a keyboard, at the very least go grab a controller from your favourite console and you are set, maybe after minimal control tweaking. The defaults are impractical, imho.I might update this review when I get more hours into the game. ",333,78,11,36,35,3,61

Dirt is back!I didn't even know that this game was in the making, but since I saw the release in early access I instantly bought it. The game delivers with insane graphics and extraordinary features. I've bin a fan of the Dirt campaign since it came out on Xbox 360, and i can definitely tell you that this is something else. It's a game breaker. It feels like this game sustained every great part from Dirt 3 and compressed it with all there is in rally to become probably the best rally-sim of 2015.In short, updated graphics, great mechanics and outstanding enviromental details.I have friends who have tried out my steeringwheel at home. After their experience, they are know convinced to get a steering wheel and start becoming a part of the racing scene!10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I have waited so long for a real rally game. Ever since I was hooked into it from Rallisport Challenge 2 on the Xbox. I haven't  played a rally game that was as great as that since. I have finally found it. This game is exactly what I wanted from the moment I started the first couple of races. My laptop can only run medium settings and the game is still gorgeous. Very well optimized. The feel of the cars are just perfect(no assists on). I haven't got too far into it so I don't know how much content there is. I don't care though, I am just happy that I finally got my long awaited rally racing gem. Thank you Codemasters. This is it. Last time I played a great rally racer was when Halo 2 was popular. So lets hope the new Halo lives up to that fact.			",90,4,2,5,1,0,1

								Dirt is back where it should have always been RALLY! Yes there hillclimbing and autocross to be added through the early acess development but the Rallying is imroved beyond recognition over previous DIRT versions, This is more  McRae style simulation, only a few hrs in so far and first impressions are very good, nice long stages (powys wales, sweet lamb in the dark and rain! in a metro 6r4...epic!).No flashbacks!! no gymkana pure oldschool rally the stages are tight and unforgiving, full damage effects pretty good at this stage.Team management is in, hire and fire crew that impact your stage repairs etc etc.the 17 cars available are a rally purists dream collection ranging from 60's mini cooper through to the 2010 fiesta RS.If Codies adresses the  bad parts (and they say they are committed to improving the game through feedback) its going to be a stand out Title well above what folks have come to expect from the ""DIRT"" series, in fact I would have considered dropping that title to head off any ""arcade""  prejudgement.As expected with Early access plenty of stuff needs work: graphics need optimisation and polishing but not too bad at that. force feedback on the G27 is squishy and a bit muted even at max settings (need to work on the profiler a bit maybe?) manual clutch seems to have not effect beyond on off (no effect on engine revs) so dipping the clutch is a matter of ON/OFF right now.the damage visuals are poor especially any windscreen cracks just look like white marker pen lol (a shame because physical damage effects seem almost right.

								It feels like we finally have a true successor to the DiRT/Colin McRae (RIP) series.  The game plays extremely well for 'early access' and looks fantastic at 1440p.  I am excited to see what the devs do from here.  I'm only 4 hours in and feel like I will easily get my money's worth.  If you liked DiRT3, tolerated the ones in between, then you are definitely a candidate for this game.  Well done.			",105,4,14,3,37,2,16

												When I first got this game in Early Access, it had all the markings of a fantastic game. The only reason I didn't recommend buying at that point was just that, it was Early Access and there wasn't a whole lot to do or see. Now that it's finally v1.0, I can safely say this is a must have for my fellow rally racing fans out there. Granted, I'm not a hardcore enthusiast whose past memories include the Colin McRae games or Richard Burns Rally, but I enjoyed the DiRT games despite them lying on the arcade side of the spectrum. This game is a much more realistic depiction of rally racing as opposed to the colorful, Gymkhana infested games of the series' past, and I love it. No longer can you take a corner at full speed and get away with it, or slam into the car ahead and deal with minor engine problems. Have I mentioned how gorgeous and well optimized this game is? A must have for rally racing fans, and fans of racing games alike.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I dont normally do too many reviews, but felt I had too here. First I am a keyboard player, so i was a bit worried reading some reviews. I have been a keyboard player, since the early days of Colin McR Rally and i have also played the recent Dirt games, which have been disappointing due to a lack of focus on pure Rally. This game ticks all the boxes! its a pure rally game, back to the good old days of Colin McR. I have been playing for a couple of hours now, I am not ashamed to say the first attempt did not go well ........ the mini did not even see half way through stage one. That when old senses came back of i need to protect the car and listen to pace note (something very noval for a Dirt Game!). I started to do that and it has started to come together. This game is hard, you really have to listen and feel the road. I have still not got completed a stage where i have not have moment of out braking myself or going a bit wide, that what keep me coming back for more, i want to finally nail a stage. I nearly did 10 mins ago, but on the final corner i slide wide and caught a tree............. so close yet so far. In regards to the keyboard, its fine, its like a rally games back in the 2000's, you just have to have a bit of skill and not drive like an idiot (or like in other Dirt games!)			",29,2,16,3,31,0,14

								After 16 hours of this game, I can honestly say that it is the most satisfying rally game that I have played for quite some time. Dirt 3, in my opinion, was a mess, the rally was quite fun, but the rest of it was just utter sh*t. But this, this masterpiece that Codemasters made, is the most intense and thrilling rally ""simulator"" I have played to date.There is honestly nothing wrong with this game as to date, but, I believe the external damage, such as door panels and bumpers, etc, need a bit of work. When I do multiple flips, I would love to see my whole car pretty much ripping apart. Overall, this game is just amazing. The rally aspect just feels so unique and Codemasters are all over this game in terms of updates and hotfixes. It is truly just a breath of fresh air in the rally simulation world. I applaud you, Codies. Fantastic work!			",100,17,6,7,23,0,17

												You think you're good in the older Dirt Games? or in any racing game at all? Well now you aren't.This isn't your average Dirt title. Don't expect to win easily, this ''game'' qualifies as a Simulator in every respect.It's unforgiving, you can't rewind time because of your mistakes, don't expect to win every stage.You ARE going to lose, You ARE going to have a hard time keeping the lead. (Learn the Stages as much as possible) and finally, you MUST, MUST! Listen to your co-driver. He actually does have a purpose.This is the Dark Souls of Racing Games, Rallying in particular. (No Duh.)

								DiRT Rally is a complete, down-to-earth rally game that doesn't waste your time with cutscenes and stories that often feel out-of-place in racing games. Gorgeous and challenging tracks, classic cars - old and new! - such as the 205 T16, the MINI, the Stratos and the Polo WRC.This is not a game for those who are getting into the genre. DiRT is a pick-up-and-play game with a realistic approach to the genre made to be played with few driving assists and few HUD displays. While it does accept a keyboard as driving input, it is almost mandatory to play it with a steering wheel (or a gamepad, if you're used to them).Graphics and sound are amazing and really add to the atmosphere - you can really tell the difference between an arid, dusty trail and a wet countryside road. Last but not least, the developers are known for their racing games and DiRT has been receiving lots of love and attention. Tons of new tracks and challenges have been added and they're still at it. Definitely worth your money IF you're into serious racing games.Oh, if you want a different approach with more gimmicks and different play styles, stick to its predecessors (like DiRT 3). Great game too.			",53,8,10,8,4,0,4

												This is the best rallying game since Richard Burns Rally and the best Codemasters racing game for some time.Codemasters has made a gem thus far and with it being in early access, I'm sure it'll continue to grow.+ Graphics are very good and you get a great sense of immersive feeling when driving.+ Pacenotes are detailed and thorough. Information overload at times but I love it!+ Sounds are brilliant, though need adjusting to hear the co-driver properly.+ Stages are of good length and decent variety. It's great having longer stages, finally and also Pikes Peak.+ Great controller support. I've been able to fine tune my G27 to how I like it to be.+ Great variety of cars (Group B, Group A, WRC spec and more).+ You can turn the entire HUD off so it's just you, your co-driver and the road.+ Addition of hill climb is another dimension to the game.- Need a button to turn lights on/off.- Cut scenes before the start of the stage I feel are needed. You press continue and you're at the lights if you're ready or not. No time to take a breath before you go.- Pacenotes at times on 'Normal' setting come up too late, meaning you're into the corner your co-driver is describing.Overall, an absolute wonderful game to date. I've never finished a rally game before where I've slapped the wheel with joy after driving through a stage. This game just brings utter joy and will do to anyone who likes racing and/or rallying.

The force feedback is awesome and rallying is super fun. i haven't played rallycross much and the Pikes Peak cars still feel weird and unpredictable on tarmac, but i don't really like Pikes Peak anyway.

												Best Rally game of all time. Edge of seat and stuff which requires great concentration but leaves you feeling very satisfied after any form of clean run.Try it with all assists off for the best experience and you will soon realise all of the vehicles are modelled differently dependant on their drivetrain (4WD, RWD, FWD etc). This massively affects your style of rallying in them and each car requires care to be driven correctly and within, or maybe sometimes just exceeding, its own limits.Absolutely love playing this and will be returning back to it for many years to come.

												Never trust a ""jump maybe,"" or, ""be brave.""While the game doesn't do much to welcome new players and introduce them into the world of rally, very few gaming experiences have been as rewarding as the first time you fly over a jump and nail your cut on a ""right 4, followed by left 3."" Even more so than winning, realizing you finally mastered a course is an excellent feeling.Just wait until you get the feel for it, then it is time to switch cars and relearn the entire game.

												This game changed my life.I became a huge fan of rally.Now when I travel in my car, and I see a car that was in the rally sooner or later, I think of that sport.This game was for me a growth: i started with the keyboard cuz i had the wrist broke, passed to my very very old wheel, bought a new one (and thinking of buy another one more PRO) ... I am continuing to slowly remove any help to guide and ""unrealistic"" stuff like the arrows for the pacenote ecc eccIt's damn hard, but you will love sooner or later.This game is a continual evolution of yourself.... and you will be proud of yourself.

												All I can say is wow, this game is great, I bought DiRT Rally around the time it was released and I got immediately ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, I am the kinda driver that goes for 1st every time, but thats the secret to DiRT Rally, you DON'T go for 1st.You need to take your time with it, don't just floor it through the map because you WILL wreck your car, pay attention to your co-driver and listen close because there is NO minimap, when it comes to hairpin turns, use your handbrake to flick around the turn, but always approach at a moderate speed. I'm also super baked as I type this review and I have now realised I have gone off track, but still too lazy to delete all thoooose letters... well this was my review, its a good game, if you like a challenging racing game, get this!

												This game works for all sort of players, keyboarders, controllerfreaks and the simhead using a wheel. It is balanced throughout all the levels so that everyone can compete. But do not think it'll come easy from the get-go. The game shows it can be used competively with own leagues and proves itself when it comes to realism over and over. Yeah, I can hardly figure out what to say. The only negative thing is that there is no way to get a throttle-input for keyboard, so it'd be easier to balance through corners, this can only be done with controller or wheel.			",11,0,2,2,4,1,3

												Best driving game ever made. Nothing is a purer driving experience or challenge. More infuriating than any other racing game, but also more rewarding. Lacks content in locations, and depth surrounding the racing, but makes up for it in car selection and the depth in the driving experience. Brilliant team of developers that have listened to a niche community of die hard rally goers in an attempt to create the best rally sim. Thoroughbred rallying at its upmost best.			",28,4,11,2,3,0,1

												I'm not going to give this a thumbs down due to my poor experience with this game. But, I can only recommend this to people who are seriously into simulation racing games, and also understand the challenge of rally racing compared to a normal race track. Just because you're good at a game like Forza on a controller, or you did well playing the rally tracks on DiRT 3, doesn't mean you'll be good at this, and here is a few reasons why.I've been playing DiRT Rally for two hours, and I haven't had the chance to finish a full championship yet. This is due to resetting my progress after two races out of the four in the starting championship, because I was doing so terribly. Even if I have a race where I haven't crashed once and I think I'm doing okay, I'm losing by 30 seconds at the end. Because there's no options on how difficult your opponents are like a lot of racing games have.Another thing is that you need to pay lots of attention to your assistant who tells you what turns and bumps are coming up. And if you think you can just stick to a driving line, too bad. There is NO option for a driving line in this game, even for braking only, and that bugs me.The car settings are a lot more complex compared to your usual driving sim, and actually plays an important role in how your car handles the extreme conditions. You can play other racing simulations and stick to the default car settings and probably be fine, but if you don't understand the settings much in this and don't have the patience to test stuff and learn how it all works, this game might not be for you. And lastly, if you're one of those players who like to restart an unlimited amount of times just until you get it right, you won't have fun with this. Championship series' in DiRT Rally, or the first championship available to play atleast, only allows 5 restarts over the four races. And you're more than likely going to mess up badly and want to restart, otherwise you'll have to ""recover"" your car and put up with being severely time penalised.If you have the patience to play the first championship over and over again and continue losing, maybe you'll earn up enough experience points and money to race some cars that you'll like better and have a better crew for car settings, then you can have a go at some different championship tournaments. But if you're not good at rally games and what I've written above applies to you, you'll probably be stuck on the same thing for longer than you can tolerate.Big ups to Codemasters for creating an insanely challenging rally game, and thankyou for scrapping the dudebro loser voice that makes DiRT 3 and GRID 2 hard to tolerate.

								This game is truly the Dark Souls of the racing genre. Codemaster took out all of the handicaps that were in dirt 3 and made the handling of the vehicles more realistic, but diffucult at the same time. As of right now (May 2015), its still in early access and only has about 16-17 vehicles, but they vary across many different specs ranging from a 1960's mini cooper to a modified Fiesta and  Impreza. Normally i would have been disapointed with such a small selection of cars, but each one has thier own unique feel to them which makes the harder to learn and thus more time is required with each car. Overall, I believe that if you are a fan of the dirt or rally series, and you can managae to take a beating, id get this game. Knowing Codemasters, they arent going to drop this game in the middle of development like other developers have.			",538,110,61,62,80,2,67

								I`ve been with Codemasters since Colin Mcrae Rally 2.0, played a ****load of other racing games from hardcore simulators to simplistic arcades (NFSs) and hardcore arcades (like the F-zero series), but I must say that this is certainly one of the best racing games I`ve ever played and it is still in early access. Altough the game still has flaws which are pretty much expected given the development state it is in, CM is doing a great work and showing the game has potential to be de definitive rally simulation experience (its core is already arguably better than RBR overall).

With my setup, a G27 wheel and a nice computer, this is in my 40 plus years of playing riacing games, THIS IS THE BEST RACER I HAVE EVER PLAYED. Easy to pick up hard as heck to master. This game is no walk in the park, but it's so good at it that I found myself both challenged and I didn't mind not winning, the racing was so dam fun. I didn't win my first race till well over 40 hours into the game. It's not perfect, little things like getting high centered and not being able to reset, sometimes, or the ""error 41"" that likes to show it's ugly face now an then. All in all 9 .5 out of 10.
