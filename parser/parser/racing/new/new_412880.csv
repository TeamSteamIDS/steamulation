 ENG REVIEW(NOT REVELANT)  Review updated! 02.05.16 Is there a lot of games of drifting on a pc?-NO!Being a big fan of the drift culture, I really liked this game,The game is already very playable! Positive things: -Support for mods-Track editor-Each engine has its own sound-Good music-NotBad physics (physics Corrected, it is difficult to drift, now I feel like a cow on ice)-Ability to swap engines (Where you still saw it on the PC except in the old good SLRR?)-Balancing car-Engine tuning-Adjusting camber, eversion of the wheels and the offset of wheels-A good number of cars (or Rather 22 which as for me is enough)-External tuning (Wheels, Wheels Painting, body Painting, body Kits (Body kits are available on Silvia 13, Hachiroku,14 Silvia and Mark 90 only))-Multiplayer (Separate servers to 16 slots, It is also possible to create your own server) Defects: -Unity Engine-Few maps (8)-Civic, what he is doing here, he is front-wheel drive? OO-Not very comfortable speedometer (IMHO) All What I would like to see in the game:	-Toyota Chaser-BMW E30-BMW E34-BMW E39-Painting of individual parts of the car in your color-Ability to put different wheels on the front and the rear of the car-The size adjustment of the speedometerThat's AllP.S. My English isn't so good, You can report about mistakes in the review on my wall :3 For all your questions about the game I will answer on the wall in the STEAM, so make sure that it is open to ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE  RUS REVIEW(НЕ АКТУАЛЬНО, Я ЛЕНИВАЯ ЗАДНИЦА, СКОРО	 КОГДА-НИБУДЬ ОБНОВЛЮ ОБЗОР)  Обзор обновлен! 02.05.16г	Много ли есть игр про дрифт на pc?-НЕТ!Являясь ярым фаном дрифт культуры, мне очень приглянулась данная игра,Игра сырая, но уже очень играбельна! Плюсы:	-Поддержка модов-Редактор треков-Завезли графончик, на 20.04.16г графон еще немного подтянули-Почти у каждого двигателя свой звук -Частые обновления	 Частыми обновлениями нас перестали радовать :с-Неплохое музыкальное сопровождение-Неплохая физика (Поправили физику, сложно дрифтить, теперь чувствую себя коровой на льду)-Возможность свапа двигателей (Где вы еще это видели на PC кроме как в старом добром SLRR?)-Балансировка авто-Тюнинг двигателя-Регулировка выворота, развала и вылета колес-Хорошее количество авто (А если точнее 22 чего как по мне вполне хватает)-Внешний тюнинг (Литье, Покраска литья, Покраска кузова, Обвесы (Пока только на Сливу 13, на Хачироку,14 Сливу и Марк 90 который я так ждал))-Мультиплеер (Появились отдельные сервера на 16 слотов, соответственно появилась возможность создать такой сервер) Минусы:	-Движок (Никогда не любил юнити)-Мало карт (Всего 8) -Мультиплеер (Почему мультиплеер и в плюсах и в минусах? Потому что он плохо реализован, кто играл тот поймет, но его присутствие это явный плюс)	 -Mark II...ПОЧЕМУ ИМЕННО СОТКА?! ДАЙТЕ НАМ НАШ ДЕВЯНОСТИК! А ЕЩЕ НУЖЕН ЧАЙЗЕР!	-Сивик, что он тут вообще делает он же переднеприводный? Оо -Слишком большой	 Неудобный спидометр (ИМХО) -Иногда камера ведет себя неадекватно  Камеру поправили То что хотел бы видеть в игре:	 -Оптимизацию))0)))000))		 -Mark II JZX90	-Chaser JZX90-BMW E30-BMW E34-BMW E39 -Nissan Silvia S14 (Ранее покоривший мое сердце)	-Покраску отдельных частей авто в свой цвет-Полный тюнинг авто как внутренний так и внешний-Возможность ставить разные диски на переднюю и заднюю часть авто (возможно я один такой извращенец))0)))000)))-Регулировку размера спидометра -Ну и возможность создавать лобби для игры только с друзями(Возможно такое уже есть просто я этого не знаю)	Вроде бы все.P.S. Знаю что Д0XY9| хочу но всеже) На все заданые вопросы под обзором, отвечаю вам на стену в стиме, так что убедитесь что она открыта АБСОЛЮТНО ВСЕМ для комментирования!	Игру рекомендую всем!

												UPDATE v2 AS OF THIS POST I WAS PERMANENTLY BANNED FROM THE DSJ FORUMS FOR REVEALING THIS INFO BY JDM HIMSELFhttp://puu.sh/ooDLr/88d0b2461d.pnghttp://puu.sh/ooDLr/88d0b2461d.pnghttp://puu.sh/ooDLr/88d0b2461d.pngUPDATE: THE GRAPHICS UPDATE AND *NEW PHYSICS* AND ""TOUGE"" MAP ARE ALL JANKUM.THE MAP IS STOLEN FROM ASSETTO CORSA, THE GRAPHICS UPDATE IS HIGHER RESOLUTION TEXTURES STOLEN FROM A DIFFERENT GAME ENGINE WITH CRANKED REFLECTIONS AND THE PHYSICS ARE THE LEAST FLUID OF ALL THE UPDATES AND MAKE IT FEEL LIKE A DSJ RIP-OFF IF THAT WERE EVEN POSSIBLE0/10 IGN - Who the ♥♥♥♥ made this pile of ♥♥♥♥?0/5 GameSpot - Worst waste of 7 dollars since that time I tried meth1/10 NextGenTactics - Polished Turd.I've been one of the biggest initial supporters of this game, and I was one of the people to help it thrive as much as it did. I can say that it was once a good game, but due to recent updates and recent events I no longer support the creator or the game.Drifting physics and controller support got very glitchy as of the miata addition, (A car that has been in the game files from day 1 wouldn't break the game)I was forum banned for no proper reason, see here; https://steamcommunity.com/app/412880/discussions/0/412449508291314237/JDM - Games creator says ""Ignore people like modnar"" do you agree?I digress there, relevant info to the game hereThe handling and controls are rather intuitive and easy for people to catch on early, however they become a problem and an annoyance down the road as it prevents you from controlling your car 100%, and they fight you in a similar fashion to nfs 2016's controls.The car list would be more impressive if all of the cars hitboxes and horsepower capabilities weren't all the same, the only differences in the cars being I believe there's 1 FWD mixed in, look out.Oh, and transmission gearings kind of make them different in-game SOMETIMES so that counts for something.All of the car models are blatantly ripped off from other games, notice how the models are flipped now? And on top of that the real car names were even used, remnants of this exist in the files and you can see it in regedit as well if not on the badges on the cars themselves.The ""body kits"" update was okay, the rim update was lackluster but I didn't complain. The steady stream of new maps, cars, and general content was good for the first month or so.Until people began to abuse broken code, change colours and glitch it out to the extent it would leave assorted coloured bubbles on your screen on the lens flare and other shadows and reflections about the map effectively making it impossible to play, gross impossible cambers, the disabling of collision (and they can still throw you around without collision too!) and addition of thousands of horsepower to ones vehicle.And then the updates halted, only to be seen once every 2-3 weeks with the addition of broken code and features that didn't really do anything. People began to quit, certain issues made the game unplayable for some and too difficult to figure out for others. This is where I came in, if people had problems, they came to me. I had over 100 players at any given time from DSJ on my list, and I couldn't go an hour without helping someone with something DSJ related whether it be in a private message on steam, or one of the hundreds of forum posts and threads on the official game or steam forums separately (Lots of em)I got people together for big drift events, did a ton of recordings with the community, and just rallied together support for it and hyped up every little update despite the circumstances while still running FREE tech support (the updates ♥♥♥♥ing sucked and were broken, look you can tell)Still JDM refuses to address the big bugs and it's been almost a month, if not so already since he broke the game in a bad way. He claims to have all this work done, well let's see it. You rolled out new content like it was a fancy carpet at first, what happened?TL:DR; I helped fix controllers and peoples games, and I got forum banned, all posts deleted and im :steamsalty:Used to be a really good game with a lot of potential until russian updates			",80,3,8,0,5,0,2

												First of all, let me preface this review by declaring that racing games are not my strength or favorite and I am an imbecile when it comes to car mechanics & terminology. I can barely change the oil in my own car so when it comes or horsepower, torque etc... I am clueless.With all that being said I actually enjoyed this game much more than I thought I would!While I found myself dead last in most of the races it was still fun. Controls were easier to pick up than I was anticipating and I was drifting in no time. As you would expect, there is an emphasis on drift mechanics with scoring multiplyers applied on how well you do it.Graphics are good with crisp, sharp outlines to the vehicles.The only drawbacks for me subpar audio/music and the lack of useful in-game settings menu.Was a fun ride but I'll stick to my strengths. Recommended for those into the racing genre.			",3189,1302,130,382,459,41,535

												Fun game that has potential but needs some work.This games drifting physics are nice but its braking mechanics need work, you can't even slow down with engine braking by down shifting witch really bothers me, also your speed wil remain constant and not drop from coasting.Some tire and grip tunning mechanics would be nice as well for the various maps such as the freeway so you're not sliding all over the place too hard.Other then that this game is fun and i enjoy it, it just needs some more work.

												PROOF ONE OF THE TOUGE MAPS IS STOLEN: http://assettocorsa.club/mods/tracks/akina-downhill.html Does this look familiar?[SERIOUS REVIEW ABOUT THE GAME AND ITS HISTORY. TL;DR AT BOTTOM.]This game used to be great, it had so much potential. Infact my original review stated ""The best $7 you would ever spend""DSJ was first getting off the ground, people were doing lets plays of it. JDM4iK suddenly had a way bigger follower base on the game.At the time, the game had great physics and a lot going for it. It was recieving regular updates with original content. It all went downhill from there.There was an MX-5 model in the game, and it was ready for release. It wasn't released until several updates later. Before that, there was: A track being changed into day, a multiplayer system, and chat.Ever since the chat system came out, it got worse. People were doing drag races, and blocking roads. Multiplayer got boring. Less updates were happening, less news was coming out.There was a physics update which made drifting a lot harder and a lot less realistic. The MX-5 update came out, with even more broken physics than before.As of this post, the update simply stole a map from Assetto Corsa and made physics unuseable.During the course of all of this, the community wasn't listened to one bit, and was permabanned for trying to speak up about all this going on.Before, I would have said you should buy this game. Now? I think it's just not worth it anymore.3/10. Stolen content, very broken physics, most of the real players have given up on the game.TL;DR: This game used to be the best driving game ever. Now it's just some horribly designed mashup of stolen maps and models. The community isn't listened to, and when someone points out something bad they get permabanned from everything.

												Used to be fun when it came out, then they changed the physics completely and added tuning. Now the tuning is gone and its just bad physics. You cant even drift anymore, the car either just slides and you crash or it turns and you crash. Game seldom gets updates and when it does, its nothing major. Tried playing it today after not playing for a while because I missed how fun it was, but was just disappointed.			",148,4,8,1,5,0,1

												I want to, but I can't reccomend Drift Streets Japan. It has nice car models. It has beautiful touge maps. But it's not fun to play. The physics can work but they feel...strange more often than not and the progression is ungodly slow with few things to break up the monotony. It's not 'realistic' enough to be a simulator but it's also trying to avoid being 'arcade' and doesn't really accomplish much.The options for graphics, gameplay, and controls are poor. This game looked a lot funner when it was released. I decided to give it some time to bake before picking it up in a sale, and I guess it baked too long and got burned. I hope one day it's nice again. I will change my review if that becomes a thing.I do really like the touge maps though. I was just hoping for something a little more like a modern IDAS.

												Every positive review is either a lie or by someone with absolutely no taste in games.  The gameplay and controls are garbage.  Gameplay consits of tapping left and right to slide about in the most simple way, you don't actually control the car just suggest which direction you want your car to spin, you don't have to touch the brakes ever and the car countersteers for you.  Braking will cause your car to actually lift into the air, never in a game have I seen a one ton car pull a stoppie.  Also, going around a corner is nigh impossible because of these problems if you're going more than 20kph(thats 12mph).  Also toss in the horrible graphical glitching that seems to occur constantly I just dont get why this has such a high rating.  Avoid.			",478,123,10,100,39,2,56

												No brakes simulator 2016.Bad-Physics suck out loud. Tap a wall? Welcome to NASA.-If your drifting try and use the e-brake or reg brake they always seems to instantly make the car go straight but not do anything to slow you down. -At speed the car basically refuses to turn.-It's been said in other reviews but no engine braking/ car stays at the same speed even off the gas. -Tracks look and feel like crap. overly bumpy. Kind of like all the terrain is made from flat pieces stacked and rotated. -Keeping the car sideways is basically a tap left and right game. -If it matters to you, your basically ghost riding. No driver in the car. (the steering wheel does turn tho!)-Other then color of the car and rims you can't do anything else to your car. The car tunning is basically camber. You can go stock or full retard both positive and negitive. -Buying an engine swap that comes OEM with a turbo doesn't give you a turbo to start with and engine levels are lower than what they produce in real life. -Mods are pretty basic. Block, head, pistons, intake, exhuast, ecu, turbo and nitrous.-Controller support is a lie. If mines plugged in the car just revs. Can't even switch to keyboard without a restart. -No control map or even a way to view controls. But if you've played NFS carbon the controls are about the same. -Stupidly small detail but your head lights work great! But your tail lights only work when you press the brake.-The money system is pretty simple/odd. No challenges or missions or anything to get money. 10k points = 100 bucks. Good.-Mad skids yo. Not really. I lied.-Cars don't actually look to bad. -in car view/ cockpit view.-Devs seem to be active. More tracks then the game originally launched with already.-Engine swaps. RB26 <3-Steady FPS.Weird? I guess.If you use the latest AMD drivers you may have odd graphical errors. When in the upgrade section the power gains for parts only show as the charts sliding over then aren't visible. But we all know AMD drivers suck. Pretty sure the games an ISO / Andorid port. I'm sure if I bothered to look into it I'd find it on the play store. At this time it's not really worth buying. But active devs, so hopefully all the issues will get sorted soon. But right now the games more annoying than fun. Sorry for the messy review. I hate writing them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Product received for free
												Drift Streets Japan is a Drift Simulator/Arcade Racer developed by JDM4iK. The game features various cars and customization for the cars, and to progress you need to drift to earn money.Pros:-Cars models, customization are well detailed for an indie game-Tracks are wonderful, and the track editor makes it possible for players to create even better tracks-Music and sound effects are good and clear.Cons:-Physics feels a bit clunky, it's hard to drift and keep a drift going. Cars have too much traction once you start, but as soon as you go sideways, there is almost no control of the car-Game doesn't really have an objective, you purchase a car, customize it and drift to earn more money to buy more cars and customizationsOverall, this is fun for casual players who just need something to waste time, but based on the physics and non-existent objectives, I can't really recommend it.5/10			",329,107,29,41,36,1,27

												Partial Controller Support actually means half of any controller will function, forum posts suggest that you need to go as far as using Regedit or third-party software for emulated/partial fixes.OC'd 4690k and 7870 couldn't cope with 900p in single player for any map and literally every car feels like it's driving at 10MPH even if stable framerates occur.While it looks nice in the trailers, in-game I can't recommend it, drifting with keyboard controls has to be a joke and botched controllers fixes aren't the same as actual controller support.

												So what i think would be great for the game is when you are tuning a car you should make it so when you upgrade it you inspect things like the motor and it changes when you upgrade it. I personally think you should get some more customization for the car so you can make the car you always wanted as a kid. Add like body customization, window tint, big nice rims and stuff like that.What would be good for online would be that you can choose what map you want to play. And i have noticed that when i play online my fps gets lower and drops more often, i think that is becuase it renders all of the map at the same time instead just a little bit of it. And add so you can talk with people like text press Y. Dont add mics but if you do make it so that you can turn it off in the escape menu so none can annoy you while your drifting. But its worth the money.			",40,2,3,0,11,0,5

												Might have only played at least 1.4 hours on the game, but the gameplay mechanics, and the graphics are amazing, and not to mention you can drift cars. Which is amazing! The game will roughly cost you about £4.99, which I think is a reasonable price for a game like this, but I would like to see more cars, more maps, and more tuning added in the future. If you haven't gotten this game already I recommend you go out, and buy it (If you like cars, and drifting of course.) I would also like to see private servers to play with friends, because when you are online with people they sometimes accidently hit you. Yes this can happen on the private servers to, but in the end you can at least skype your friends, and tell them to go on at a time. I would rate this game 10/10, just because it has potential for the future, and I like cars, and drifting. Upate: The game is normally getting updated every 2 days! Which is some amazing work by the dev's of th game, and or the dev of the game! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's actually pretty good!  Graphics, physics, it's all here, it's the perfect game!  Or well, part of a game.  It's far from done.  Developer, PLEASE put up an early access banner.  There's no way this is a finished product.  There's no races, events, it doesn't even keep track of anything besides money.  You just slide around in short maps and that's the whole game.  Please, create us new cars, maps, and more things to do!  It's pretty barren right now!

Oh and I see another reviewer stated that the dev is giving out free keys for shill reviews.  I wish I had known!  lol I paid for mine.  http://i.imgur.com/msrcPNs.png  I always like to support indie racing games that are $5-6 brand new.  I am very impressed at this one.  But don't expect more than a slide around simulator.  It's not a whole game.  Oh, and there's no Toyota Supra.EDIT 2016-01-04: There IS a Toyota Supra, now!  Also there are four maps.  And online multiplayer, and controller support.  This developer is patching the game several times per day with huge changes.  It's surely in active development, but the least he could do is put up the Early Access banner.  My frames per second in multiplayer is absolutely horrible.  Maybe in a couple days he can figure that out.  And the controller doesn't work properly, but it was not a feature that previously existed.			",4119,1557,197,486,660,69,658

												This game suffers from a lot of the same issues that plague the drifting games on mobile, most notably the floaty handling.   It is nearly impossible to go in a straight line, even when none of the wheels have broken traction the car seems to float sideways, as if on ice.  Forget about using a wheel. besides the handling there's decent graphics and cool selection of engines for swaps. They got the right idea but need to fix the physics.			",49,5,9,0,3,1,0

												Drift Streets Japan is a racing game what based at the drifting.In this game is a gameplay is simple enough, at the start you got a some cash, so you should buy a car and ... start drifting! Well at the start I a bit afraided, because the drifting in racing games not my strong side, i never liked drifting tasks in NFS and other games, but this game is surprised me. Drifting here is enough simple, controls are good, so its shouldn't make for you any trouble. In a game you will found a lot of cars what you can buy them if you have enough money, also the customization is very good, the game have enough deep tuning system. The money for tuning or new cars you can earn by drifting, because when you do this you earn points, for example if you earn 70000 points, its equal to 700 dollar.Also in this game you will found a enough maps, track editor, coop and multiplayer feature. The game music is good, well complements the game feeling. The graphic looks very nice, the cars are really has a realistic view.So my verdict+nice graphic+nice music+easy controls+good customization+track editor+multiplayer-no trading cads and steam achievements-""only"" drift maybe can be repetitive Well this game is looks interesting, however there you should only drift its also can bring for you a lot of fun, because this game have a lot of cars, good customization and multiplayer too. So i think if you like racing games you should try this one, especially if its got a good discount. 7/10 ",2100,795,71,247,237,24,306

												Even with updates still feels like a mobile game ported to steam, game is not like other racing simulators on the consoles such as frza and Gran Turismo as far as handling and gripping.Its fun to hop on and do a couple drifts around the track and hop off I honestly do a few 360 drift entries and a lap or two and hop off within 10 mins. Its great for an arcade style of drifting somewhat of how the Need for Speed series is as its not as serious or simulator like for drifting. The brake and hand brake can be glitchy as the creator behind the game tends to mess with it between updates. Feels like the game will be one day abandoned as he is focused on many projects all at once including new ones. It was nice when we had a lobby for many ppl to join and not be restricted to 12/16 but in the end this was a free mobile game ported to steam which i notice costs more than the 6.99 i originally paid. The game lacks real courses has a few cars that are nice to drift with, would be solid if the game had a 1st and 2nd gen rx7.Seems like the courses could be further refines and the track editor is very limiting also you cannot share the track editor online. Customization on the cars is mediocre while the game features a 93 honda civic hatch back with upgrading/swapping a rear wheel drive motor the car still stays front wheel drive making it the only car that can grip in the game. None of the other cars are grippy for grip racing as the game is set up for only drifting. I would recommend it if your a fan of drifitng but i would not pay the current cost of what is being asked for now. Seems like there is a big chance for this game to be abandoned in 2017+ with the mobile need for speed like features.Pros 73 skyline, ae87, fd3s, gtr skyline, 240sx, and japanese carsQuick arcade like drift style good for small amounts of time for boredom Backwards entry, 360 entry, drift point combo multiplyer Quick to pick up if you are used to drifitng on gamesConsDevelopement of levelsMultiplayer limited to 12/16 players "" was unlimited at one point then there was a 64 slot server room later removed ""Akina level is very glitchyTrack editor is limited with little features to use / no capabilities to upload online to shareSometimes upgrades may make your car feel grippier than beforeneeds more refine with controls and more design in levelsBland level designMain menu is simple very mobile game likeHonda civic in a drifting game.... Not even the rare 4wd model, with motor swap civic stays fwd :(Needs a 1st and 2nd gen rx7, 73 celica, mr2, mazda cosmo, nissan fairlady z 91, silvia s13, s14, levin corolla or ae86 coupe corolla, mitsubishi evolution any model any other japanese classic would be nice. Controller support can be hit or miss on some people			",81,2,4,3,3,2,2

												u have f***ing make it even worse and worse after every update... STOP IT!! i was able to have fun and make x32 drifts but after every update u have made it just NOT fun NOT even POSSIBLE to drift.. controls are now too stiff and unpredictable and when i get car to slide/drift there is 2 possible ways how that will end.. 1. to wall without even drifting.. just sliding like maniac.. 2.u got drift.. nice now change direction while u drift.. whoops.. car spins 180'.. GG fu. give me oldest update back and start again..ps. would have recommend this game. but.. after every ''let's make game just even worse and not fun to play and drift update'' i have to say NO! i will NOT recommend this game to anyone even for FREE BEFORE u make it back Drifting game what it truly was and stop this slip and slide madness what this game has now become. forget every realistic thing what u are trying to do here. this game was never realistic  but simply amazing fun and easy to drift.... now... i can't even..

												If you are looking for a fun drifting game this is it. Its really fun to play with friends and I enjoy this game so much then i just wanna waste my time, but saddly it looks like devs not really working on this game last update was 3 months ago and it was just reverting old physics. Saddly i have to give dislike because lack of content. Lets start with cars, there are only 3 cars you can tune out of like 12 its really bad. Only 1 car has polished interior which looks hd but others looks so ugly like gta sa fps mod ugly. Ok now lets go with maps. OMG were to start, there are only 2 maps that are made really good others are jsut ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and bad. Lets take a map called Akina, road is porrly made going down hill it looks like just plates conected and side rails if you toche them youre car starts flying. I really hope devs woud start working on a game again it but as it now its unpolished, bad, buggy. And I think this is one of those early ascces games that will never be finished. At the position game is at its not worth youre money. Sure grab this game on sale because its not worth 5 Eur. i wanna recommend this game but i cant its porly made like it was rushed.

Title: Drift Streets JapanGenre: Multiplayer, Racing, SimulationDeveloper: JDM4iK Publisher: JDM4iK Release Date: 21 Dec, 2015Introduction: A car enthusiast would be drawn straight to this game, with the positive reviews and mechanics that are said to be the most realistic, and I can say that indeed they are. As soon as I launched the game, the first thing I noticed was that it was not going to be a walk in the park, you could feel the lost of traction as you were spinning out of control after every corner, making it quite heart-racing along side a cliff. Although it will seem hard at first, after a few hours of gameplay, you start to get the hang of it. The customisation is also very thought out, with buying new cars to fine tuning the engine, it really makes you think how to spend your money!Pros: - Hours of fun to be had.- Lots of customisation.- Extremely realistic physics and mechanics.- A reliable developer.Cons:- May be stressful at times.- Are a few bugs. (not game-breaking)- Can yet again become repetitive.Final Thoughts: Overall, this game is perfect for car enthusiasts looking for a bit of fun whilst still having realistic physics & mechanics. You can also hook up a wheel to your computer for the perfect experience.Personal Rating: 8.5/10Thank you for reading through! ",93,15,0,3,3,0,5

												Drift Streets Japan is an illegal street racing game. It's actually a very  good game. What is better than drifting all around Japan. I've always loved tuned cars since I was a kid. I've played many racing games and this game ain't on the top of the list nor in the bottom.The soundtrack is super awesome. Trap and Drift is just perfect. The sound FX is good. The engines sometimes sound strange but everything else is good.The graphics are quite good. The textures are good. The cars, the tracks and the surroundings are detailed. The game's physics is great.The gameplay is very easy. You get used to it in few seconds. The arrows or WASD for movements, Space for Hand breaks, X for clutch, Shift and Ctrl for Shifting, F for repair and C to change the camera. It support Gamepad and Steering wheels well you gotta do some stuff first but it will work out. You can't use the keyboard outside the track which is kinda annoying.The multiplayer is impressive it's really fun to play with you friends. There are lots of cars they all are Japanese tho. C'mon you can't imagine yourself drifting in an Actros SLT oh wait that's a different game.There are eight tracks. They are perfect for Drifting, Driving and Sightseeing.There are lots of ways to tune and modify your car's performance. There ain't many body modifications. Sorry RICERs this ain't a game for you lol.Earning money ain't hard cough in a legit way cough.There ain't a driver so it kinda feels weird at first the same as Burn out Paradise.The cockpit camera is also good but no hands on the wheel <.<If you decreased height of your car it glitches while driving.Changing the colors is also sucks you  need to click ∞ click to find the color you are looking for.It supposed to be an illegal street racing game but there ain't ant cops.There is only options for Audio and video settings. Needs options for key bindings changing the games files is a pain.The game is definitely great. The price is kinda low lol that makes it even better. If you play only in single player mode you will get bored fast so make sure to play with others.I loved it. And I recommend it.If you are interested in reading and discussing reviews.

												Bought this game (for $8AUD) entirely due to the fact that the promo image contained my real life car (s15), unfortunately the game as of now does not contain a s15 *insert sad face*. Is it worth 8AUD? No. Do i regret buying it? No. *DO NOT LET THE IPHONE STYLE GRAPHICS SWAY YOUR DECISION* the game is extremely addicting particularly due to the drifting physics (Great compared to most simulators, can be a tad better), the inbuilt jukebox(Trap junkies will love it) and the combination of sound effects within each vehicle, Bov's and dose pipes (quite pleasantly) sound exactly as they should in real life and provide me with a sense of immaturity where i build boost and let off the throttle (as i do in real life (; ) resulting with the tickling of my nuts as the glorious sounds of zuTUTUTU222tototo is released. Engine sounds within this game also seem to have been provided effort (SR20s sound like SR20s!!!).in conclusion, if your a car enthusiast (particularly JDM) and you have the money to spare, buy this game to prove to your mates that your not a ♥♥♥♥ c-u-nt at drifting as they have called you IRL and redeem your self from the humility you recieved as the sl00ty Gangas and elderly pensioners give you the little finger as you one wheel peel your open diff na sh!tbox around the local Maccas CarPark. *Note to car enthusiasts i believe the R34 is a 25gt-t not a GT-R as seen with the z-tune bodykit hence the RB25 in the car specs tab (makes sense right, drifting game = rwd). Basically think of it as a ♥♥♥♥ kient who couldnt afford a GTR but wanted the ganga next door to give him the gobby of his life as her moot quivers in fear whilst in the presence of that fibreglass infested replica virginity taker within his drive way.also if the developer sees this, more tracks (figure 8 plz), more cars like my s15 and ai vehicles could be a little faster and less stupid (like that van who crashes into another van and keeps driving with the van on top of it.)TY TY.

In the game you earn points for drifting to buy a car or upgrade it , right? What if i told you that you can drive a car and upgrade it even if you did't bought it. You can earn many many many point my going in the track editor mode and just press S and A and you will get millions of coins in minutes. I regret buying this game.

												They rekt this game real hart.....RIPIt used to bee fun, drifty and all. Now they changed the whole physics enginge, and basically everything that made the game fun, and... as you probably already guessed, its fukt. Better buy/download SLR:R with mods, for the tuning factor, though its a bad game in terms of physics, still 100x better than latet version of DSJ. ",348,75,44,30,45,6,39

												I didnt play this game for long, because almost everything in this game is broken. clutch, brakes, reverse gear, even drifting is broken, and its a DRIFTING game! you get better drift physics and more control in mario cart, then this game. you dont have full control of the car, so drifting fell so weird and broken when using a keyboard. there is almost no customization, besides from a few bumpers, sideskirts, wings and rims. No vinyl, No exhaust, No neon lights, nothing so that you can make a real JDM car. The only thing positive about this game is the sound effects.I hate that i wasted money on this game, so i recommend that you dont waste 5 euros on this game, until the game gets some major updates and more content. its not worth it.I give this game a 2 out of 10, but only because the sound effects are good, but if the sound effects was as broken as the rest of the game, it would be a 1 out of 10.

												-- THIS IS NOT A FANBOY REVIEW -- So I'm going to lists some pros and cons so far into my gaming experience.PROS:+Japanese import cars+PS4 remote compatible( I use Pinnacle Game Profiler ) +The turbo spools+Some drift tracks are okay+The aftermarket parts are cheap+It's easy to make money just by drifting+They have a Toyota Chaser dammit, other game industries should learn from this+Interior is not bad at all, just need minor touching here and there+When in interior mode the driver moves his head left and right when in drift mode and is not stiff.+You can adjust the camber and offset of your car+Music is alright, the list should be more at least but it has potential.+They have mods which is nice ( My favs: Ebisu, Tsukuba etc )+Community is good+Dat price thoCONS:-The car lists can should be more considering some of these cars aren't even licensed. -You hit a wall and your car goes flying in the air like it's zero gravity. -You hit a wall slightly (like a small wall tap) and all of your points is gone.-I don't know what's up with the recent update but the frames are like 14fps on max settings-Some of the cars sound like vacuum cleaner which should be polished a tad bit or at least mess aroundwith the sound editing ( Not the 1JZ it sounds great )-The tracks should be polished a bit as well, there's some invisible walls sticking out on Drift Track 1-There's hackers which needs to be dealt with seriously.-No customization parts for the exterior or interior of the car or able to remove front bumper to expose intercooler.-No neons or strobes which is a bit sad honestly-No in-game vinyls such as itasha, tribal, real life car designs etc-No workshop for this game...like how can you not.-Can barely do a tandem or drift train with somebody without their car lagging back towards you causing it to hit you and then you lose all of your points and everyone elses.-No steam trading cards or achievementsThat's about it honestly. I somewhat recommend this game but it does need a polish on a few areas listed above since there's too many fanboysoverhyping this game. Overall score: 7/10It's not a AAA title like Gran Turismo but it does have potential to fill in the blank spaces GT has left behind on the drift scene that it was capable of.Official review of TeamA99E Drift Warriors -  ドリフト・ウォリアズ			",34,4,2,2,1,0,1

												All of these are rated on a scale of 1-10, 10 being best and 1 being worst.Game play: 7/10 The gameplay takes some getting used to, but when you get the handling down the drifting is fun and the car mods are fun too, although drifting feels like it's on ice.Graphics: 6/10 The graphics are decent, except for cockpit view.Story: N/AMultiplayer Experience: 10/10 This game's community is small, I won't lie about that. But, the community on this game is one of the best communities on any game I've ever played. They're willing to tandem, drag, train, and help you on a moments notice. It is some serious fun.Single player Experience: 8/10 Think multiplayer mode without the people. It gets repetitive.Overall (Average): 7.75/10 This game has a lot of potential and is already a decent game. Some of the best fun you can have for 7 bucks. The devs regularly update it with new content and features. Oh, there's also a track editor, so there goes even more hours of your life. ",98,3,3,2,5,0,0

												ENG:In fact, I car games fan and virtually every aspect of the world most popular driving game for tried-and-play, so still this kind of game has not yet been published ever 3D format and is therefore one of the world's only 3D format playable drifting - car games, where the money can get just drifting.Although a number of car games is the world published and these will be able, if desired, drifting, so these games are not made of just drifting in contrast to this game. By way of separately concluded drifting competitions but these will be isolated. Most car games are usually competitive, or point to point running on stepping stones, so the grip is usually such a key issue as opposed to sliding.The game includes a few tracks and several Japanese brands of cars, which may wish to tune the engine more efficient but, the visual appearance can not be altered until further notice. High testimonials for this game.FIN:Itse olen autopelien fani ja lähestulkoon jokaista maailmassa olevaa suosituinta autopeliä kokeillut ja pelannut niin, silti tämän kaltaista peliä ei ole vielä julkaistu ikinä 3d muodossa ja näin ollen yksi maailman ainoita 3d muodossa pelattavia drifti - autopelejä, jossa rahaa voi saada pelkästään driftaamalla.Vaikka useita autopelejä on maailmassa julkaistu ja näissä pystyy haluttaessa driftaanaab niin, kyseiset pelit eivät ole tehty pelkästään driftaamiseen toisinkuin tämä peli. Poiketen erikseen tehtyä drifting kisoja mutta, nämä ovat yksittäisiä. Useimmat autopeleistä on yleensä kilpailullisia tai pisteestä pisteeseen ajettavia etappeja niin, pito on yleensä näissä avain asia toisinkuin liukuminen.Peli sisältää muutamia ratoja ja useita Japanilaisia automerkkejä, joita voi halutessa virittää tehokkaammalla moottorilla mutta, visuaalista ulkonäköä ei voi muutta toistaiseksi. Korkeat suosittelut tälle pelille.			",452,105,67,38,78,8,80

												Could be better, could be worse.There aren't a lot of drifting games out there and this is probably one of the few better ones.It has a lot of flaws like the physics - They feel like you would drive on ice.Also the multiplayer is quite laggy but it got better since I first played it and tbh you can't really expect brilliant servers because this isn't a AAA title.The car selection is quite good and more cars are being added to the game (some of which you won't see in other bigger racing game titles. For example the Toyota Mark II).The track selection is also quite good. From smaller tracks with tight corners to 30kms of Touge mountain roads you have some great tracks in there. If those aren't enough for you, you can also add some mods that you can find on the forums. Or you build a track with the built-in track builder.I think it's a good game for when you're bored and need to kill some time. It could be a lot better if they would re-work the physics. I hope this was helpful! :D			",43,1,11,3,3,0,1

												this game is not great, i mean like if you got nothing to do and you are looking for a decent drift game you could get games like project cars and the dirt series. This to me with 2 years of drivinggames with a steering wheel (logitech g25) feels like you are sliding accross ice with barely any traction, in real life this would never happen unless you were in a ice ring. i guess if you have nothing to do you can try it but currently there is no controller support meanwhile there is wheel support and h pattern shifter but no ffb in the game, this put the game down for me and now i rate it 3/10.

												- Good selection of cars.- has a Toyota Chaser/JZX100.- Turbo flutter- A metric F*** ton of negative camber.- Engine swaps and preformance mods. Cons:- Audio could be better.- Random frame drops.- teleporting glitch on Akina.- Lack of car body mods.- Down shifting is a bit odd.Meh:- Rfactor style grahpics, meaning cars have decent res on the outside but the tracks don't.- Controller support is messed up.

												I really want to like this game, but in it's current state.I really cant say I do.1: Lack of content, it's pretty much a paid for early access pre-alpha advertised as a full game, I thought something was odd when it's a 3D game application and the total size was 300mb. I was right.2: Mechanics are incomplete, the physics are off to a nice start, however they are not finished and the braking mechanics are really broken.3: Performance issues dispite having very simple graphics, including little to no foliage and little to no traffic the performance is surprisingly bad.4: Game is themed in Japan but there is no Japanese music or Japanese themed music.Infact the general mastered quality of the soundtrack is prodigiously bad, which is unfortunate when music is so critical to driving immersion.5: Multiplayer is broken, maximum capcity as of this review is 100 players online in 1 server.It does have lan support, if your into Lan parties.If you've an interest in this title, I would advise you wait, add it to your following and see how it develops.Otherwise you will probably be dissappointed if you try it as is.

												This game is fun, however know that it is NOT finished. Besides this updates are being rolled out every day it seems and the game has improved dramatically since it's release. There are a few features I would like to see implimented into the game such as a chat box, players have no way of communicating with each other. Secondly there needs to be some sort of private lobby support, so you can play with your friends without running into other people online. Many people playing in Akina want to twin drift up and down the mountain however you're constantly crashing into other players.Thirdly the crash/bump physics need to be greatly improved, when you bump a barrier or another car you completely stop in your tracks, these pysics are and unrealistic just generally annoying to play with. Another thing I would like to add is the multiplayer needs some optimization, from your point of view other players cars are jumping around everywhere and overall look very buggy.Aside from the negaives this game is getting better everyday and I hope the developers stay focused and listen to their community to make this a great game.

												TL:DR - This game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks and you all know it.I didn't really enjoy the game to an extent. I've heard that people praised for its previous versions because of the old physics. But even with that,I still won't recommend it. It looks outdated,the effects were eye-gouching. The camera placement is hindering gameplay rather than helping you see what's in front of you. Especially in narrower maps like Akina,where every corners look as miniscule as a bag of ♥♥♥♥♥. Modding wasn't very intuitive and sometimes the forum don't look as active as it could've been.Would I say it's the worst I've played? No. - It's just flawed in so many ways,I've played it for a couple of hours in this game with friends just to bash about how terrible it is. It could be improved,I've already seen some people trying to mod this game,and that's great for them. If you look at this game in a value standpoint,it's a no-no at that. Then again,if the developer actually tries to make the game better,sure. I'll play it again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I will sum this up as quickly as I can. Controller support is crap. Brakes don't work, just throw your car into the air. It seems that if you have a newer graphics card (I have a 980ti) you can't adjust the graphics quality off of ""standard"". Video card runs hotter than with any other game I have played due to there being no vsync option. I don't require 200+ fps and would rather not have my card running 75c.

												Let me just keep it simple. Pro's + Fun mechanics, takes a while to get used to it, but all in all it's quite enjoyable to just slide.+ Multiplayer has a lot of people on it, tons of people to drag against or drift with and syncro. + $6.99 is modest as ♥♥♥♥ for a game like this, me and all my mates have bought it.+ the turbo spool sounds absolutely amazing, really impressed by it.+ Decent music selection. + Akina is very well made. + GREAT car selection, could use a few more but at this point it's great.+ Very DETAILED cars (besides the fake names which I believe is done for the purpose of avoiding copyright)Con's While I understand the game isn't yet complete, and not anywhere near that stage, these are based on what I see the game needing currently.- Needs more multiplayer options/servers, a drag mode could be cool, and a faceoff mode would be sick.- Needs more paint options for the car, JUST painting the body and rims isn't really enough.- We need somewhere to suggest music for the game, it'd be really sick to hear some music we genuinely listen to whilst drifting.- more maps, maybe a drag strip map for a drag mode or something like that.- Need more part selection for the cars in the game.- A few more vehicles would be cool too, maybe add some muscle to drift with, I'd suggest a BMW M3 (E36), RX8, Ford Mustang, would be mildly hilarious to see a Nissan Fairlady Z, they're ugly but it'd be worth the laugh.- NEED TO FIX the multiplayer sound bug, it's really annoying, I have to play with volume off now because of it. - REMOVE car contact on multiplayer, ANNOYING as ♥♥♥♥ getting hit out of a big drift and losing valuable mula.- Down shifting is really off. - tracks aren't designed for cars really anywhere above 350hp max, bit of a shame. - Breaks need to be fixed, or made customizable, aka let me throw brembo's on my 777hp AE86 so I can stop it lol.At this stage I can say I am extremely happy with the game and every cent i spent on it, it's quite fun, especially linking massive drifts together for money on a private lan, beyond the cons I can happily say I am content with the purchase and I recommend it to anyone into the drift/jdm/customization scene.By the way for anyone complaining about FPS drops, that's all you, I run a beefy set up and I never drop FPS dramatically at all, if you didn't know, this game has a SINGLE dev, you're going to need to be patient and wait for him to find the time to make this game what we all want, I'm sure he'll get to it all with time.

												waited a few months before i left this review.  great concept, but executed horribly thus far. for months now people have been waiting for controller support, still nothing. yes you can connect a wheel and pedals but theres no force feeback so whats the point, even if the game just added some resistance i would be happy. i could accept that from a game that is still this early, but even xbox controller is completly useless, which again wouldnt bother me that much if the dev had not stated many times over that it is ""fixed""overall i think this game could be pretty neat but i have a feeling that one day soon the dev is just going to stop working on the project and move on. quit adding content!!!!!!! the base game is good enough already, the cars supplied in the game currently are more than enough for a game this early. just fix the base game before you keep adding more unwanted garbage and i will happily change my review to a positive one.

												I'm going to be honest here. This game is not good. They physics are abismal, the sound cuts in and out online, controller support is nonexistant, and the point system is glitchy (you lose point on impact with anything, and i mean anything). The maps are poor quality, like relatable to need for speed underground, the first one from 2003! The only real redeaming factor for me is the fact I can mod it REALLY easily and make straight up joke cars. For god sake, I made a s2000 swapped with a 2jz that had so much power the number was an exponent! XD I really wouldnt recomend this game to anyone being I don't think its worth what you pay for. If it was free or under $4 then maybe. But NOT worth $7. TLDR: really not good, except as a joke when you mod it.			",48,2,4,2,3,2,0

												Drift Streets Japan is not the best car game i have played in a long shot. Yes its the only game like this on steam, and yes the drift physics are decent. But the game isn't perfect. Sure you many say for $6 its pretty cheap, and it is. But is it worth buying?To answer that in short : Yes, i think it is. I bought the game when it first came out, and back then lets be honest the game was missing ALOT, but after a week or so after release, the game has been updated quite a few times, always adding new and improved things. Such as manual transmission, more cars, a better interior, and much more. Yes, of course it could use alot of work, with the many bugs, and being able to use a controller, but if you look past that, and see that is has a chance to become something great, it makes you wonder why you shouldn't buy it. I do have high hopes for this game, as it has already come so far, and i do believe the dev's have some idea as to what they want to add.In short, i think Drift Streets Japan is great game to pick up. Yes, it has bugs and glitches, but what game doesn't? and what game on steam allows to buy drift like this game does? NOTHING.Hense why i recommend this game.			",90,13,11,7,13,0,2

												Summary: ♥♥♥♥ game and ♥♥♥♥ing useless developer. Don't buy, spend money elsewhere.I love cars and thought this game would be cool. It was alright when I got it, you just had to get used to the crappy physics and controls. NOw after the ""update"" it is complete trash. Don't buy this game. The developer thinks he's updating the game, but he's making it more trash. My car will randomly roll over if I drift and I go flying off the map into oblivion. Also the camera is super crap. I can't drift, and if I go online my framrate drops by a million. Please spend your $5 on a good game, with a nice developer, who likes games more than money. ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ game and dev.

												Short review:Needs ALOT of improvement (better sound design, better graphics, more cars, more tracks and customization etc) but I see the possibility of a good game very soon due to the fast updates.Pros:Very quick updates (had game just over a week around 7 updates have come out since)Great cars (even has a C33 alongside other classics like 200sx and ae86)Great drift feel (update just fixed drifting now feels excellent)Great community (Lots and lots of people playing on the servers)Great scoring system (simple but works, I assume other modes will be added later but this works)Runs very wellCons:Needs more customisation on cars (something like the old NFS games perhaps prostreet)Slightly better sound design ( some things sound a little strange and music could be reworked maybe to have a system like Prostreet or absolute drift)Better graphics not needed but wanted (maybe not required so much since gfx update)Overall:Id say get it if you're into japanese cars, great game updating alot with a good community.

												Everyone who played this game as long as I have knows that this game has improved. At first it will be diffucult with the lack of controller support. But, I and most people use the keyboard control and we have so much fun. You can either have a good time doing tandems, making friends or even just taking awesome pics. People that say that this game is bad are the people that don't practice to get better. It took me around 30 hours to master the technique, ever since I play this game at least once per week, it's not much but I don't have a lot of time anymore. The people that are complaining that there is no improvement need to go to the forums as there are 1000's of modded cars. If you want a rocket bunny S14 then go the the forums, you will find it on there. Now play this game and practice. Don't complain on something you try once or twice. ""practice makes perfect"" So stop complaining and start playing this amazing game. The dev left it but we haven't.			",22,1,3,0,0,0,0

												Drift Streets Japan is not the best car game i have played in a long shot. Yes its the only game like this on steam, and yes the drift physics are decent. But the game isn't perfect. Sure you many say for $6 its pretty cheap, and it is. But is it worth buying?To answer that in short : Yes, i think it is. I bought the game when it first came out, and back then lets be honest the game was missing ALOT, but after a week or so after release, the game has been updated quite a few times, always adding new and improved things. Such as manual transmission, more cars, a better interior, and much more. Yes, of course it could use alot of work, with the many bugs, and being able to use a controller, but if you look past that, and see that is has a chance to become something great, it makes you wonder why you shouldn't buy it. I do have high hopes for this game, as it has already come so far, and i do believe the dev's have some idea as to what they want to add.In short, i think Drift Streets Japan is great game to pick up. Yes, it has bugs and glitches, but what game doesn't? and what game on steam allows to buy drift like this game does? NOTHING.Hense why i recommend this game.			",90,13,11,7,13,0,2

												okay here we gothis game is acctualy better than i expected : +The physics are not the ""Most Realistic and Best"" but are pretty fun.-There is too much assistis that you just cant turn off, -Graphics can be improved... ALOT+really fun at times to just slide around+the customization is really nice with added engine swaps (sadly there is only ~200 bhp engines)-the sounds are horrible(almost went wan gogh style after playing this with headphones)+frequent updates-small map selection(hopefuly to-be better)+-not the best car selection, but improving every few days-horrible multiplayer(it is there)-the title of the game-no miatai would give this game 3/5 shredded tyres in its current state. i really see potential in this game, and hope that the developers will change the name of the game to something better,  improve graphics and really update this game in every aspect. in summary, really fun arcade drift game.its tottaly not a ""simulation"" game as the tags of this game says, dont be fooled			",110,11,14,10,13,0,9

												I'd recommend this, ONLY if the following apply to you.-You got a few bucks burning a hole in your pocket-You have access to a decent steering wheel (Logitech or better)-And are willing to put some work into sorting your controls (both via wheel & in-game)Things like visuals & audio are always subjective, some might like it, some won't. Music volume can be controlled if you don't like it, engine/exhaust/tire sounds do their part well, and the visuals are a step-above the old NFS-Underground games.If you're looking to play with a controller, wait until full-support is confirmed, or don't bother as it won't work.(long story short, it's both game & controller related, involving trigger command-axis issues)That^ said, I have been enjoying the game with my Logitech G27, set-up to behave like a drifting go-kart of sorts. The game offers some level of 'customization', which devolves to body-color/wheel color combos, and what engine/perfomance-stage parts you choose. There are a fair amount of JDM cars to choose from, and PLENTY of engine-swap choices (my current/favorite combo is a ""S240"" [a.k.a 240sx] with a ~500hp KA24DE[-T] motor).The physics are arcade-ish, but feel more 'weighed-down' than the NFS2015 ""200mph EVERYWHERE"" behavior, think the old Underground games with a hint-more realism and weight.Is there $7-worth of content ? - debatable Is there $7-worth of entertainment in the game ? - I'd say yes;Between the solo-mode and the lag-chaos of online, the occasional online tandem (that doesn't end in cars getting launched to space - although still humorous) and the solo practice of finding the sweet-spot for your driving style and the cars perfomance, I could see anyone (who's done the research/effort and didn't just go ""GAME BROKE PLZ FIX) enjoying themselves for around 7-hours total.

												Really good game. The drift physics are fun and the multiplayer keeps me entertained. You can tune your cars and even though you may start with a terrible car, you can mod it to be like superman if he was a car. but with these pros there still comes cons. Here is a list for those who can't read poorly formated text:Pros: - Good drift physics (really fun and challenging if you have a faster car, but still fun)- Tunable cars (Really entertaining, and keeps you playing, also the possibilitys are endless)- Many variations in cars- Multiplayer (both lan and online multiplayer)- More features are still to come as this is not a finished gameCons:- Most Quality Graphics?? This is not a game for testing your new Nvidia Titan X. Quake has better graphics.although the only reason why I would say the graphics aren't good is because of the models, they are low poly however the car models are fine, just the map and such. The textures maybe a little too. The graphics are playable and decent though- FPS cap. So we don't have much of a graphics intensive game, which may be good for you guys with not so good specs, but now we have bumped into an fps cap :/ However, this will probably be removed in the future.- People who crowd around multiplayer and crash into you. (Collision atleast in spawn needs to be off)Overall, the game is great, and is like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas drifting but in one game, and improved in all the ways possible but graphics. Hopefully someone can make an enb mod for this :P			",85,8,19,0,9,0,8

Attention, looks like the devs abandoned the game. Also they are working in a new game on greenlight, so if you bought this game make sure to tell the devs to not left this good proyect behind.Why i do not recommend the game?* Game is empty, there is no objective, or history on the game, not even a race, just a free roam on different maps to get points, and money to waste in cars, or autoparts.* Fov from cars are very bad adjusted, with some cars you just can't see the track well.* 170hp cars are better than 650hp cars, high end racing cars are just unmanageable even changing tunning options.* Multiplayer is just a joke, same as singleplayer, a free roam on different tracks, with no objective, but with people driving on it, also they can troll your drifting points by hiting you (the only fun part of the game).* Bodykits are not for all cars, just some cars can be modified visually.* No stickers, no graphic stuff for the cars, also no pilot / arms on car.* No workshop, they support mods, but button gets you to the forum and you need to install them (not many mods) manually on game folder.* sometimes the game crash, it makes my pc restart two times, also i found some bugs.* Last but not least, there are not many tracks where you can drift, but game has a level editor (never tried it).I really want to like this game, but it needs to be polished, and also finished, it looks like a pre-alpha in it's actual state.

												Alright, i'll be completely honest here.i had a lot of faith in this game when i bought it; the constant updates every day or so, the community etc. until about a month or two after, when updates basically halted to once every three weeks, and with every update that brought content or fixes, another bug would arise. this game is great in it's concept however leaving a game that has it's whole back-story/influence to a russian guy is like letting an indian direct a movie about the american civil war, it makes no sense whatsoever. this game had so much potential for growth however it looks to be just a cash-grab for the dev as he seems to be focused on making another game, and it looks to be that he is pretty much porting stuff from that game and putting it in DSJ.honestly, buy it if you've got the dosh to spare, but don't expect much.

												Awful physics, awful controller support, glitchy multiplayer and not even support for adjusting controller mapping in-game, something that should be taken for granted these days, especially on racing games.If the glitches are fixed, proper controller support added, and fix bugs for multi (and single player) I'd probably buy it again.The concept is great, you have control over camber and offset of the wheels, you can tune the car (not as fine-tuned as possible, but certainly a nice amount) and the multiplayer is in theory where the fun really is. But all the issues take A LOT away from the experience.At this moment, would not recommend this game. 4/10Fix the bugs and it would easily be 8/10 or even 9/10.			",239,15,18,27,11,2,17

												Me not like it very much. This game has below average graphics, only a handful of tracks, and honestly this is the kind of game I would expect to find on a mobile appstore.

But the thing that gets me so ♥♥♥♥ing mad about this game is that the creators expect you to pay for a game and they expect you to figure out how it works. DO NOT USE A CONTROLLER IN THIS GAME. Steering wheel support for this game is ♥♥♥♥. I used my Thrustmaster T80 and it was ♥♥♥♥. I couldn't steer on drive with my wheel. So when I put unplugged my wheel and tried to use the keyboard... I was ♥♥♥♥ed. You can't reset your keys and you cant input new keys once you set a controller key for them. If a game cant put in a simple reset button, it just shows that the creators don't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about your gaming experience. This game is not worth your 9 dollars.

												Has potential. having played forza 4 a lot its hard to get use to the different physics. Bugs me how the car grips up when you try to slow down by coming off the throttle or using the hand brake, generally resulting in ploughing into a wall. Could be massively improved with working controller support. Also using foot brake in a drift will more than likely spin out the car. The tracks need to be smoothed out a bit.With some physics tweaking, some competitive game modes, better tracks, and more upgradability and tuning i could definitely put some hours in. Not currently worth 4.99 but could be in the near future.			",26,1,1,3,7,0,1

												A quick summary: this is a very rudimentary release about a year of two of development away from being an actual game, and the store page hugely exaggerates the features on offer.Driving: Initially in the only available starter car, the physics seem decent with a fairly natural if exaggerated feel to the drifting. However, as soon as you add power or change to another car it starts to fall apart, with bizarre spins, slides and acceleration in unexpected directions. It feels more like a set of predefined reactions to certain inputs rather than any actual physics simulation, and once you deviate from basic powerslides it breaks.Graphics: The car models are serviceable if rather low-poly (ignoring the large holes in some), but the tracks are very, very basic - some games of the 1990s had more trackside detail. The 'traffic' only exists on one track, and seems to be mainly static cars with extremely low levels of detail.Gameplay: The only gameplay loop that exists is that scoring drift points gives the player a small amount of money per point, which they can use to upgrade then score more points. There is no other gameplay at all.UI: The menus are relatively clean and functional, however simply viewing any performance upgrade seems to immediately purchase it with no confirmation.Audio: The sound effects are passable, the highlight being the turbo sounds. The music is not to my own tastes, but the production is at least okay.Car culture: The choice of cars is well selected for a drifting game. While bodykits are only currently implemented for one car, and there are only 5 choices of wheels, the sheer presence of visual upgrades at least scores a point here. The engine swapping feature is also decent, although the stats for the engines generally bear very little resemblance to the real engines that they are named after.Overall: The game frankly lacks even the most basic levels of polish or even gameplay, and has some jarring inconsistencies in the quality of the art assets. While the developers clearly have put some heart into it and are continuing to work on the game, I wouldn't recommend a purchase now unless it's 90% off and you're happy with 20 minutes or so of just toying around. Hopefully the support keeps coming, and in a year or two this may be worth the budget price.			",539,139,42,41,55,7,50

												First off let me say, the game COULD be a lot of fun. The cars are great, the upgrade system is nice, the maps are meh okayyy, but trying to play this game with a keyboard only (especially with all the drifting that requires to constantly change steering directions, releasing and pressing the gas to coordinate clean drifts) makes it a NIGHTMARE to control your car.

												the physical manifestation of your car on the pavement has more in common with scooby doo when he chases something and does the running thing for like 30 seconds before he actually moves. its like your tires were made of butter or something. 100% of the braking force is applied to the front wheeles only so controlling the car is interesting when sideways. for a drifting game why there isnt force applied front and rear is beyond me. but ya its just $7. it would be cool if the mechanics of it were not so made up. but i am a motorsports guy and have spent some time on a track myself so maybe if you just want an arcade game its cool.

The game play and controls are horrible the cars auto counter steer sometimes and do nothing other times and its garbage. Controller support is a joke I tired a XBOX360, PS4, Saitek and Logictech controllers none work properly, button mapping is a total mess and its unplayable with the keyboard. Dont waste your time or money, this game isnt finished and it shows. The sound effects are Atari 2600 quality and its tracks and backgrounds look PS2 at best.

												There is a big problem with inputs, anytime that I (and a few other players i've heard of) join a lobby or start a single player game it will rev the car to about 6250 rpm and keep it there, I believe that it holds down the brakes as well. I'm running a keyboard and mouse, but the issue is still there even with them unplugged. This makes it impossible to play and I will update my review when the problem is fixed and I can give an accurate review.			",80,3,7,3,12,1,4

												Okay, redoing this review to help some people out if possible.This game is far from finished, is that a bad thing? Absolutely not, this isn't just an android game that's been ported to steam to get the dev some extra cash. The dev(s) are actually updating the game and listening to what people want implemented into the game. There's no stupid microtransactions it just comes down to earning the money yourself to buy cars and upgrade them. It's a great time killer if you want to take a break from one of the flagship racing games just to screw around in an arcadey drift gameThe game is $7... it's fun and it's getting updated frequently. you can't really go wrongPROS: -Detailed car models and reastic engine/turbo sounds -Decent selection of drift/japanese cars that keep being added to the game -Easy to get cash and figure out the controls -Gives you the satisfaction of thinking you're actually decent at racing gamesCONS: -Multiplayer, it's not very good but it definitely has potential  -Not a lot of maps but im sure more will be addedStill better physics than need for speed. 10/10			",20,0,6,3,6,0,0

												This game is very simple and awesome! I'd give it an 8.7/10There aren't many maps, but honestly you don't need more than those that are already in the game! They teach you how to drift  slow and steady and by tuning the car and messing around you can get your drift skills to the max, and make combos that go around 1.000.000. Points :D Soon you'll be drifting like a boss.The bad thing on this game though is, you cannot put on spoilers or change the bodykit a bit. You can however change the color of the rims/body and angle your tires or widen them. I don't mind it not being filled with tuning possiblilities like in Need for Speed, but it could make the game more fun. So customisation would be awesome for an update. Maybe a few more cars (not just JDM) ;)I'm glad finally some racing game put in a Nissan 350z in it ^_^			",118,51,6,21,16,3,6

												This game has lots of potential, and I feel like the game is well worth the $10 that you will pay for it. TL;DR at the bottom.Pros:Sounds - the engines in this game sound pretty close to the real life counter parts, and that is important in a game like this! Big Pro!Car Looks - Cars look amazing.Customization - There are some cool options and the devs add more and more.Constant Updates - It is great that the game gets constant updates. The devs are active and so is the community!Cockpit View - It is a great thing to have and if you have a wheel, then you are set!Cons: Glitches - This game is a glitch fest (At the time I am writing this which would be April 4th 2016), I won't lie. Braking downhill is sh$t, hitting the wall or someone else at a high speed glitches your car, and so on. Track Graphics - They are not that good, not a big con but it takes away from the immersion.Car Interior - Not detailed enough, especially when the game has a cockpit view, you would want to have some sort of detail. Though keep in mind this game costs $10, so having a cockpit view is still great!Controller Support - (at the time of writing this) Pure balls. Seriously it is not that good.Car Handling - There are some cars that handle like complete crap, that definitely needs to be fixed.TL;DR Overall, while glitchy, if you are a car enthusiast and you like drifting, turbo flutter, and JDM.

												Wow.  This game seems super incomplete and hacky and broken.I hope they continue working on it.  I would like a fun ricing game where you can do stupid mods on your car and race some nice mountain tracks, etc.Unfortunately, so far this feels like early alpha. Using a gamepad won't really work.  Partial gamepad support implies that you can play with it, but with limited functionality.  I couldn't even figure out how to make it work.  The configuration is very janky.  I couldn't figure out how to remove a secondary control once it was set.The physics are silly, the cars automatically countersteer, the brakes don't really work,The controls on the keyboard have certain  things hardcoded.  Pressing R puts you at the start of the track, even if you have assigned R to another function.The tracks are very coarse.  The centre line is made up of big linear segments.  The terrain is really repetitive.  It feels like it's all just placeholders.It looks like this game is being actively developed, so maybe it will turn into something some day, but for now it's really not worth buying, and I really don't see how it got such decent reviews.  It should still be early access.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played two maps in this game. The first one broke when i clipped a wall, the car fell through it and my multiplier hit 33 and had about 10 million score before i closed the map. Second time i used the brake, my car flipped over a barrier and took out some oncoming traffic. 10/10 would play again			",148,29,34,28,19,4,18

												Please Please PLEASE Bring back the Sideways and Forward Settings, it is awesome but the physics are too slidey and hard to control and you cant do fast grip times or drag cars anymore and those settings are what changed the game and put it in the right direction, all there is too do now is just drift with twitchy ♥♥♥ physics but before There was SOOO MUCH that you could do than just drift which is what expanded the community but with these updates removing settings that limit your creativity and your personal taste just kills the game and makes you want a refund but just PLEASE STOP DESTROYING THIS GAME AND BRING BACK FORWARD AND SIDEWAYS GRIP EDITOR (and please for the love of god...make the grip more grippy and maybe even downforce settings cause we need more options to expand the settings) Other than that, playing this game with running in the 90's and deja vu playing in the backround is just 11/10			",31,1,4,0,3,0,0

												I have been playing this game for a few hours now, enough to which I feel I can review the game in it's current state.The game overall is very enjoyable to hop on and do some solo drifting or some online tandems. There is a decent amount of cars to choose from as you progress and gain more money (Unless you know how to use regedit xD). The customisation is not amazing nor awful, it is in the middle. There are body mods unique to most cars, be warned some cars currently have no body mods! The engine swaps are an awesome feature that do change the cars overall feeling but the engine tuning is pretty poor in the sense that it is all the same but then again there is not a lot that can change from car to car. The maps are all great in my opinion and the map creator feature is a great addition to try out for all players! The map creator currently does not have lots of objects but there is enough to play around with. The game does not feel near to finished but is constantly being developed.The bad point for many players is the controller issue. For myself this is no problem as I own a G25, but the controller input is complete garbage and is not even worth trying! Using a keyboard also sucks so don't expect much without a wheel!!! But let's be real here for £3.99 you cannot get a better drifting game!Overall I enjoy the game and can't wait to see new features being added in the future!			",83,14,6,5,7,1,2

												So this games ok for a drift game not spectacular by any means. There are some really fun things and some things that really bug me. I really like the modifications and swaps for the cars and that there is a modding commuinty i just wish there was more to it. some things the game really needs work on are 1. the physics are god awful. Ive never played a drifting game where ill just give the wall the smallest of love taps and it send me across the map going 200 mph. 2. the crs havge super odd hitboxes. i drice an rx7 fc that i downloaded and it still happens with other cars not just mod cars but the hitbox for the cars is like a foot larger than the actual car so half of the wall taps and crashes just make no sense at all cause you arent even close to anything. 3. sometimes the cars act really stupid and i know that sounds wierd but sometimes your car will literally just spin out... nobody knows why its not like youre smashing the E-brake or anything just sometimes taking a normal turn at a reasonable speed is enough to spin you out. That and if you are going full throttle you cant steer you car. Not like steering you car is important or anything but i played with it a little. you have to let off the throttle to turn the steering wheel ehich i thought was a little weird.Just mky overal thoughts about the game at its current time			",105,3,2,13,12,0,2

												This game is so horrible that even takes part of IGM worst game of the year.I would say its very close to be at least a lil good one but still worst because every racing game made on Unity is really a pile of junk and no one likes random jumps from MX-5 on mountains drifting, making more than 10k score and randomly jump.I will go with good stuff and bad stuff:Good stuff: -MOUNTAIN AKINA WHICH IS VERY CLOSE TO THE REAL ONE AND EVEN FROM THE ''D''-Lots of cars even Fairlady Z and AE86-Tokyo Highway but it's so lonely that you are going to see a minivan and a ae86 with blue rims-Multiplayer is ok but rare-Many mods you can do on your car like in real lifeBad stuff:- A really bad optimize for older system, SSAO and 8x Antialiasing is only on and off option- You cannot modify game settings to a lower res- The sh**est physics i've ever tried and ProStreet has better than it- You have to drift everyday on Akina to get some cash for your next upgrade- Made by Russians because there is too much Trap music on there- Saucy mods which arent mods- Ugly textures on trees and other misc. stuff- If you want to play on lower resolution on fullscreen, you are stuck to nothing- It's very clean and very boring like MMO games in particularOK STUFF:-AKINA BECAUSE WHY NOT+ if you get some eurobeat, you are going to feel the powerslide- Level editor is very icy because there is nothing but only props install- You can do LAN race/ Host for a serverIf only this game would cost 1.99$ on sale or something but it's very bad and very bad that i recommend playing initial d on ps2 emulator			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would currently recommend this game since it's only $5, However it lacks content and would've been better suited if it were an early access game. But what it lacks in content surely makes up for it's addictive playstyle (especially with friends). I definitely hope the devs are still adding on to this game.Nevertheless, this game is overall super fun and I would like to encourage any drifting enthusiast out there like myself, to buy this game!

												In other Racing games, drifting feels dull and boring to pull off. It's not satisfying in the slightest to pull off a long, whole corner drift in other games. In this game though, I feel like they just might of perfected drifting. Drifting feels somehow tight and loose at the same time. It feels amazing to drift a whole corner and keep a huge combo. Soundtrack is also amazing too. Also, losing a 500,000+ combo in this game is one of the worst feelings in video games.			",110,12,13,4,6,2,0

												So this games ok for a drift game not spectacular by any means. There are some really fun things and some things that really bug me. I really like the modifications and swaps for the cars and that there is a modding commuinty i just wish there was more to it. some things the game really needs work on are 1. the physics are god awful. Ive never played a drifting game where ill just give the wall the smallest of love taps and it send me across the map going 200 mph. 2. the crs havge super odd hitboxes. i drice an rx7 fc that i downloaded and it still happens with other cars not just mod cars but the hitbox for the cars is like a foot larger than the actual car so half of the wall taps and crashes just make no sense at all cause you arent even close to anything. 3. sometimes the cars act really stupid and i know that sounds wierd but sometimes your car will literally just spin out... nobody knows why its not like youre smashing the E-brake or anything just sometimes taking a normal turn at a reasonable speed is enough to spin you out. That and if you are going full throttle you cant steer you car. Not like steering you car is important or anything but i played with it a little. you have to let off the throttle to turn the steering wheel ehich i thought was a little weird.Just mky overal thoughts about the game at its current time			",105,3,2,13,12,0,2

												Please Please PLEASE Bring back the Sideways and Forward Settings, it is awesome but the physics are too slidey and hard to control and you cant do fast grip times or drag cars anymore and those settings are what changed the game and put it in the right direction, all there is too do now is just drift with twitchy ♥♥♥ physics but before There was SOOO MUCH that you could do than just drift which is what expanded the community but with these updates removing settings that limit your creativity and your personal taste just kills the game and makes you want a refund but just PLEASE STOP DESTROYING THIS GAME AND BRING BACK FORWARD AND SIDEWAYS GRIP EDITOR (and please for the love of god...make the grip more grippy and maybe even downforce settings cause we need more options to expand the settings) Other than that, playing this game with running in the 90's and deja vu playing in the backround is just 11/10			",31,1,4,0,3,0,0

												This game is so horrible that even takes part of IGM worst game of the year.I would say its very close to be at least a lil good one but still worst because every racing game made on Unity is really a pile of junk and no one likes random jumps from MX-5 on mountains drifting, making more than 10k score and randomly jump.I will go with good stuff and bad stuff:Good stuff: -MOUNTAIN AKINA WHICH IS VERY CLOSE TO THE REAL ONE AND EVEN FROM THE ''D''-Lots of cars even Fairlady Z and AE86-Tokyo Highway but it's so lonely that you are going to see a minivan and a ae86 with blue rims-Multiplayer is ok but rare-Many mods you can do on your car like in real lifeBad stuff:- A really bad optimize for older system, SSAO and 8x Antialiasing is only on and off option- You cannot modify game settings to a lower res- The sh**est physics i've ever tried and ProStreet has better than it- You have to drift everyday on Akina to get some cash for your next upgrade- Made by Russians because there is too much Trap music on there- Saucy mods which arent mods- Ugly textures on trees and other misc. stuff- If you want to play on lower resolution on fullscreen, you are stuck to nothing- It's very clean and very boring like MMO games in particularOK STUFF:-AKINA BECAUSE WHY NOT+ if you get some eurobeat, you are going to feel the powerslide- Level editor is very icy because there is nothing but only props install- You can do LAN race/ Host for a serverIf only this game would cost 1.99$ on sale or something but it's very bad and very bad that i recommend playing initial d on ps2 emulator			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Wheel like Thrustmaster T150 doesn't work so who has it and wanted to play this game, then Rest in piece man. I want that to happen too.A lot of greatly customizable cars, when you know how to drift, then this game is awesome.One thing I would LOVE to see in this game.Muffler/Exhaust customization. Really would love to see that in this game because with the first car (Nissan 240SX) When you put a different rear bumper the exhaust is hidden, you just have a hole in the bumper. So please add exhaust customization.			",64,3,21,2,14,0,2

IS THIS WHAT YOU CALL A DRIFTING GAME HAHAHAHAHAHA! I honestly can not be professional towards this game at all it doesn't deserve it.The two only good things about this game are one the cars and customization and two playing online with people... this has to be the shortest damn good point I've ever written for a game, good or bad.Now the bad like I said before fullscreen is broken, there is no options for graphics, the damn controller doesn't work, there is no challange in this whatsoever... why the ♥♥♥♥ is this here, why does this ♥♥♥♥ing exist on steam.Personally stay the ♥♥♥♥ away from this game unless you actually enjoy ♥♥♥♥ poor mobile games on your damn pc not that its always bad BUT THIS IS BAD, I'm lucky this game came in a $4 USD bundle... if it was up to me this game wouldn't even be worth it for free!

												Awesome game! This game is so cool! Also has online multiplayer, and there actually are a lot of people playing online! I use manual transmission set to my keyboard numpad, but make sure you disable automatic shift when you are in the game and press the key ""ESC"" because otherwise it won't be working to use manual. Really amazing game! Lot of fun with friends!			",109,22,17,5,21,4,9

												Don`t buy low-end junk!I have only seven minutes on record. In this seven minutes i had to restart this game about 6 times to mess with these terrible setting thid game has to offer.So this Game has some serious issues. The menu is terrible: FOr example there is no Exit Button to ""Exit"" the Game OR there is one but i cant see it because the resolutions of this game are messed up as hell.  The Controls are a joke, even when u change them this Game doesn`t give a ♥♥♥♥ because once u are ingame the default settings are back in place.This game has decent graphics and the sound is okay but nothing special. The Physics are good that`s a plus for sure. The driving feels surprisingly well i have to admit.But Guys this game has no sweetspot from any point of view. Why would u buy this game for about 7€ when out there are so much better alternatives?  Right there`s no reason for that! U can get Games like Dirt3, Bournout Paradise etc. for the same OR a bit of extra money.As i said: Don`t waste your money on low-end junk!			",252,56,13,34,34,3,51

												I got this game as a gift and it was miserable, the physics suck, controller support is non-existant and from some reason, people are doing dragracing instead of drifting because drifting is almost impossible, and that you cant change key bindings ingame is just ridiculous.

												The hell is going on with all these positive reviews? The game is just... broken! Am I supposed to be constantly accelerating? Am I supposed to be able to flip my car over with the lightest tough against another vehicle? I thought not.I guess I don't really understand the point of this game. In my experience, the drifting mechanics in racing games not even heavily focussed on drifting is better than what is on display here. Assetto Corsa? NFS Shift 2? Heck, even Dirt 3. Maybe it has a place because it's only $7? Seriously though, spend your $7 elsewhere.			",552,165,24,63,77,6,92

												this game does not support controllers this really sucks first of all i do not want to or should have to download a 3rd party app just to get a wheel or joystick to work. Also every single car in this game has major understteer problems and feint drifting in this game is physically impossible ( you do not or should not have to use the E-Brake to feint drift look it up dammit) the dev should have thought about looking at racing scripts before uploading this to steam because it has some of the worst mechanics i have ever experienced plus it feels more like an arcade game. The inside viewmodels are absolutely terrible and some of the years on the cars are completely off. I do love the choices in cars and engines though; sadly this seems to be the only experience this dev had with cars  though because this game is so bad im considering a refund you seriously need to fix this now!!! AND BEFORE YOU SAY ITS ONLY 7 BUCKS WELL I COUULD HAVE JUST BOUGHT A REAL RACING GAME FOR THAT MUCH IT IS SERIOUSLY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ME OFF!!! FIX IT NOW YOUU HAVE THE MONEY NOW WITH THE REVENUE FROM STEAM THIS IS TERRIBLE. Dont upload something if your the only person that thinks its right it feels like the damn thing wasnt even tested most of the tracks have invisible walls that halt you in you tracks. Also the engine rpms will drop if you excede certain angles WTF!!! What do you think happens when a tire has no traction you think it has a mind of its own and decides to drop rpm.............. You cant stop when going in revers your car simpoly glides backwards for 100 feet and they still have not fixed the controller support as of 2/20/2016 they clame they did but no no no they did not at all and the fix they posted has the potential to seriously mess up the game also the ""fix"" guide is so bad they dont even show you everything in the regedit which btw they want you toi edit if you want to play with a controller this should have been patched in so the average user doesnt make there game unplayable the creator of this game has no regard for the consumer only his buddies and doesnt care if it is unpayable because steam is already paying him for it.

												Love Cars? Drifting? Illegal races?  This is your game!I love this game, I lovespeed and cars. I remember when after school I went to arcades to play the classic Daytona with my friends. This is not ""Daytona"" but a nice version of an illegal racing, in your illegal garage with the chance of putting some stuff in your car.This is a really good game with a lot of options a the garage to set up your engines, cambers, offsets, and, of course, all tunning stuff related! Of course, takes money from your budget. At the beginning, you have to start with a base car. The good news: painting it's free! Then with the money you will be able to change the engine, adding extra HP it's quite nice. Don't forget to check the turbo, adding nitro and many other interesting things. Of course, we can change the body, swap, and rims!Gameplay: I suggest a joystick, but also keyboard helps. You have the LAN option, playing alone or with friends at the Japan highways or multiplayer version, with other people and try to get some money. You have a chat option and summon friends to race or just having fun drifting. You have a lot of things to do.You have two cameras options, third person, and first person, I always like third but both are great.Graphics: Graphics are not bad. We are not talking about GTA V but I really like the work of the artist team. Cars are different, you can personalize colors. Textures are cool too.Music: The best part of it. The sound of the engine is different from first person camera, also the music. And the themes are just great. Enjoy good music for speed? You gonna have it here!Creating new scenarios: I think this is the big one of the game. You can create your own racetrack! I tried, but I have to say you need patience. The editor seems not to be complicated but you need to have some time.Extras: There's no presentation of the game after the ""made by unity"". You just go to the garage. I suggest to fix that, would be nice to have a good presentation of the game.You can subscribe the forum. You'll get an extra car if you validate your Steam account. Also, many gamers share their scenarios created with the editor and you can download them for free! It's a great community. I loved that.All extras of this games deserve a 3/5. Of course, all games could be better but this one, I loved it.Suit up boys and girls, it's time for speed!			",859,317,21,57,108,11,99

												To who ever made this game, I would like to say you had the most briliant plan of a game but your engine is pethetic just like my spelling. Your point system is the worst. Where have you ever seen a drift game that does not support a clutch peddle? Upgrade your physics and your gears for h shifter with clutch peddle support and ffs stop adding new cars engines and body parts and start ficing the game to be a proper drift game. Thank you. I do feel I wasted my money on this game. Good game bad engine.			",29,1,3,3,1,0,2

												I would advice you not to buy it, you can assign right trigger and left trigger, for accelleration and braking but it wont work in the game.

												Love Cars? Drifting? Illegal races? This is your game!This game is somewhat the best I've played throughout my years in Steam. I remember when after school I went to arcades to play some class games similar to this with my friends. This time, they've taken the whole experience of having to spend $2 per round at an arcade full of random people constantly watch your skills to your own PC! This is a really great game with a ways you can customize your rides and pimp them out to your dreamed wives in your garages to set up your engines, cambers, offsets, and so on. At the beginning, you have to start with a cocky ride, but as you play along you're bound to get rich and make it rain all over cars. One of the plus side is colour customizations is free, unlike many other games out there, painting would be the thing that eats up your in game money. You're bound to customize every detail just like me, From it's brakes to the very own rims!Though, I strongly suggest using a controller / Joystick but it's compactable with a keyboard helps. You have the LAN option, playing alone or with friends in the Japan highways or multilayer version, with other people as you try to earn some money. You have a chat option and summon friends to race or just having fun drifting. You have a lot of things to do as to compared to others, you can't.You have two camera, third person and first person, I personally prefer a third party view, but different peoples have different perspectives.Graphics aren't bad. We are not talking about GTA V but I personally really like the amount of effort of the artist team as put into the game.I think one of the main attraction of the game is where you can create your own racetrack! I tried, but I have to say you need patience. The editor seems not to be complicated as it seems, But I'm just an impatient player.You can subscribe the forum. You'll get an extra car if you validate your Steam account. Also, many gamers share their scenarios created with the editor and you can download them for free! It's a great community. I loved that.This game deserves a 8/10 rating from me.Suit up boys and girls, it's time for speed!			",211,51,10,14,29,6,22

												Dont know what to write here so here is how to install a turbo boost gauge.A little bit of consideration is essential before handing over your cash for a particular boost gauge.First, you need to decide the maximum boost pressure you plan to run. If, for example, you expect to run no more than 1.2 Bar (17.4 psi), a gauge that reads up to 1.5 Bar (21.8 psi) is perfect - it's good to have a little bit of headroom so you can recognise overboost conditions.You may be aware that some boost gauges read positive pressure and engine vacuum; a vacuum scale is very handy for setting up an adjustable blow-off valve, general tuning and faultfinding. Speaking from experience, it's also the easiest way to identify when a small hose has popped off the intake manifold. Certainly, where possible, go for a boost gauge that shows vacuum.Note that the sweep of the needle is important for viewing accuracy - the greater the sweep, the more likely you'll make a correct reading. Another important factor is the diameter of the gauge - the most common diameter is 52mm, but smaller 40mm units can also be bought. Unless mounting space is an issue (which you'll need to determine before making a purchase) we'd opt for the larger size gauge, as they're considerably easier to read.And what's better - a metric or imperial boost gauge? This comes down mainly to personal preference. Psi (pounds per square inch), kilopascals (kPa) and Bar are the most common pressure units - whichever of these suits you is fine.Your budget will determine whether you'll be using a mechanical or, possibly, an electronic boost gauge. Mechanical boost gauges, which use an internal Bourdin tube, can be bought brand new from as little as $40. Electronic boost gauges, however, can run to several hundred dollars. As the name implies, an electronic boost gauge is fed an electrical signal from a remote pressure sensor. Electronic boost gauges have a few advantages - they generally have slightly better accuracy, most have a peak recall function and, because the gauge is fed an electric signal from a remote pressure sensor, there's no requirement to run an air hose into the cabin.Installing a Mechanical Boost GaugeWhere to Find the Optimal Pressure SourceThe best spot to connect a boost gauge is the intake manifold; most typically by 'T-ing' into one of the existing manifold hoses. So why is the intake manifold best, you ask?First, manifold vacuum won't register on boost/vacuum gauges unless you make a connection downstream of the throttle body (ie inside the intake manifold). Only boost pressure can be measured along the path between the turbocharger and throttle body.The second advantage of connecting the boost gauge to the intake manifold is you'll receive a more accurate representation of actual boost - the amount of positive pressure received by the engine. Connecting a boost gauge anywhere between the turbo compressor and throttle will give a too-high boost reading. Thanks to the inevitable restriction through the intercooler core, intercooler plumbing and throttle body, an engine suffers a boost pressure loss on-route to the manifold.Click for larger image Using a 1994 Subaru Impreza WRX as a demo, we T'd our boost gauge (a second-hand Japanese import job) into one of the hose connections on the topside of the manifold. The hose we selected was one that connects to the purge control solenoid on the underside of the manifold.Note that - instead of cutting the factory solenoid hose - we fitted a T-piece to the existing end and added another short length of hose to hook onto the manifold connection. This means, if we later decide to remove the boost gauge, the original hose will be long enough to reattach to the manifold connection. The third port of the T-piece is dedicated to the boost gauge.And what sort of T-pieces should be used? Brass fittings are certainly the most durable but for a completely stealth installation you can't go past the plastic T-pieces used on 993cc Daihatsu Charade carby turbo engines. We're led to believe that the same T-pieces are fitted to atmo versions as well. These beaut little T-pieces can be picked up from the wreckers for free!To ensure none of your boost gauge hoses pop apart, the vacuum hose clamps used on the Daihatsu Charade Turbo are, again, ideal and available for free. We didn't bother with these since we don't expect to run mega boost.Four millimetre rubber vacuum hose - available from auto parts stores for around $3 per metre - is fine for running from the manifold to the in-cabin gauge. Vacuum hose offers OE-level durability and it integrates into the underbonnet scenery perfectly.Routing the HoseThere are a couple of things to remember when routing the hose from the manifold to the in-cabin gauge. The hose should not be kinked, it should be kept well away from intense heat sources and it should not foul the operation of any moving parts - particularly the throttle!We routed our boost gauge hose around the factory blow-off valve tube, beneath the top-mount intercooler, parallel with some factory tubes that run along the firewall and, finally, though the firewall. A couple of cable ties were used to secure the hose into position.Most cars have several firewall openings that are capped with a rubber or plastic seal; we'll use one of these to pass through our boost hose. Have a good look under the bonnet to find a seal that isn't too crowded with wires and/or cables and prise it away from the firewall using a flat-blade screwdriver - be careful not to strain any wires or cables from inside the car. Next, enlarge the hole in the seal so it's big enough to accept the 4mm rubber hose - this can be done with a pair of pointed scissors or a razor. With that done, refit the seal to the firewall and poke the boost hose through to the cabin.Note - in no circumstance should a hose, cable or electrical wire rub against the metal edge of the firewall hole. Install a firewall seal from another vehicle or use a sheath (even just a short length of rubber hose) to avoid contact with that sharp metal edge.Working from the driver's foot well, route the hose beneath the dashboard so it won't foul the operation of the pedals, steering, handbrake or any other controls. Again, use cable ties to secure the hose at various locations to prevent it falling somewhere it shouldn't - like on your feet while driving! Cut the hose in the vicinity where you intend to mount the gauge.Most boost gauges incorporate a bulb for nighttime illumination. Two electrical terminals can usually be found on the back of the gauge - one for a positive electrical feed and one for Earth. Note that - unless LEDs are used for illumination rather than a conventional bulb - you can hook either terminal to the positive or Earth wire. A conventional bulb is not polarity conscious.So where should you wire the illumination bulb to? Well, the best place is to connect into the existing instrument illumination circuit - this enables the boost gauge to illuminate along with the rest of the vehicle's instruments.In the case of this particular install, we powered the boost gauge bulb from the illumination circuit for the cigarette lighter (which is immediately alongside). We simply T'd into the two wires that are used to illuminate the cigarette lighter surround and ran the appropriate length of hook-up wire to the ashtray area. To enable easy installation and future removal, we soldered two short lengths of wire onto the gauge terminals and adjoined the ends with a pair of spade connectors.Note that most (all?) cars' electrical systems will be able to cope with an extra bulb without being overloaded.
