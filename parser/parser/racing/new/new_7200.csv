												I bought this game back in 2007 with a fancy TrackMania t-shirt for 33 bucks. I spent thousands of hours, building new tracks, driving thousands of tracks, hunting for new records, making in- and outros for my tracks, having nice conversations with probably the best community ever.Now, about 8 years later, I bought this game for 30 bucks again, just to have it on steam.TrackMania is and will always be the best game in history.

												An unfortunately often overlooked game that has an extreme amount of respect from it's players but not a shred of acknowledgement from the rest of the world.I don't think this game got any hype at all, really. Which is a damn shame, seeing as how much hours people have put into this and the fact that the community of veterans has somehow managed to stay alive and well after all of these years.I got the original Trackmania (The original) game out of a cereal box. And if I didn't, I bet I would have never touched the series. Out of sheer awe from the quality of the game, I bought Trackmania: Sunrise Xtreme off of Ebay years later. And now, I found that there was a steam version of the game, Trackmania: United Forever, which luckily enough, is a full-functioning combination of everything in the Original TM and Sunrise Xtreme TM into one super-game with content updated for both games and new content for both to officially mash the two together on an updated playfield.For people new to the series, Trackmania is mostly a racing game. HOWEVER. You build your own tracks with the exact same advanced freedom the developers had when they made the standard tracks The races are non-contact and are purely for who can get the best time A lot of the game is directed towards break-neck stunts and mile-long jumps that require extreme precision to complete flawlessly The game has multiplayer that is cleverly designed to have the players race together but remove the effects of lag, competition and griefing by simply using non-contact 'ghost' style races and stunt events As a map builder you can concentrate just as much on making the map beautiful and realistic as well as concentrate on somehow making a single ramp send the player from one end of the map to the otherWhile being a game with a lot of features for multiplayer, the game definitely accomodates for the offline community as well. And being that the races are a 'ghost' style event, you don't have to worry about poor AI opponents or finding other people to play with as the people's races on the same course are recorded to be your 'ghost' opponent. In fact, you can turn off the 'ghost' opponent entirely and just race against your own time if that's how you want to go.The only time I ever have a problem with the game's community is when I find myself forced to play somebody's extreme track that takes half an hour to complete because some people are certain their creations are the s**t.Please, give this game a chance. Please.			",51,6,5,7,4,0,2

												If you give this game only a brief glance, you are going to see a simple arcade racing game where cars look like toys and drive round corners at speeds exceeding 600 km/h. But if you look under the shell and start probing deeper you shall see that TrackMania is in fact many things and it isn't in fact simple, but rather simplistic.Do you like hardcore racing where you need to hunt for tenths and hundredths of a second, and even a small concentration lapse can result in a crash when you are on a world record pace? Come on in, there's plenty of that. Do you like to build maps for others to race at? It's easy to do that with a built in editor. Maybe you prefer doing various stunts, such as backflips, barrel rolls, driving through loops or just riding the walls in a car? TM is a perfect choice for you. Just in case you like puzzles, there's a game mode for you where you have to build a fastest way between start, finish and a few checkpoints using a limited amount of blocks. Then again you can just challenge your brain and your very self to try and seek for outrageous shortcuts in others' tracks, as nobody can dictate you the order in which the checkpoints must be driven.And there's definitely more to this game than I mentioned above, feel free to discover your favourite bit of the game.One of the best things is of course the community. People are usually friendly, helpful and positive in every way.Last word from me: http://united.tm-exchange.com/ - check out this website, and the quick links. Maybe that will lead you to something that can hold you playing this game for thousands of hours.			",121,14,16,6,4,1,6

												Note I purchased this game on dvd way back when it was intially released so I have vast playtime in this game outside of steam. The only Trackmania game I had played at the time was the original. I picked it up for 5 bucks at a convention, not knoning what I would discover. I loved the track editor, and the consistant car handling making the time trials pure skill and pathfinding. Trackmania United it the refined accumulated verision of all 3 the Trackmania PC games before Trackmania 2. It's a great hot wheel style racing, It's tight. it's right. The content creation within the game is incredibly accessible enabling new content to be continuously created by players. I often play online without experiencing playing the same track twice. Anyone can easily create playable tracks resulting in a gigantic amount of tracks existing. THe online community in this game is still huge and full of dedication. For example, there's a site for sharing tracks and racetimes online that's still lively. united.tm-exchange.comLove this game. Great if you like this stuff. The competitiveness can be intense, and it can be joyful to shave a few crucial miliseconds off your best time.			",130,19,17,12,27,0,24

												There's no upgrade system in Trackmania. There's no collision detection between you and other drivers, there's no difficulty levels, no physics settings, no slow motion crashes, no random hazards, none of that. There's you. There's the clock. And there's the never-ending pursuit of the perfect line. Trackmania United is, simply put, the definitive example of a racing game in it's purest form.This is one of the only games I have ever played in recent history where the one and only factor that determines your success is your skill. You can't blame anything on other cars getting in your way, moving track pieces, or not having enough nitro to shoot you past the competition. Barring things beyond your control such as real-life distractions or equipment malfunction, whether you win or lose is entirely determinate on how skillful you are. That's it. This alone makes Trackmania United an ideal game for those who can do without more conventional elements found in other racing games; the people who are satisfied with the honor and glory of simply being more skillful than somebody else.Trackmania United is somewhat of a compilation of all the games that came before it, and when compared to the latter games in the series (the fractured release of Trackmania 2 and the console port of Trackmania Turbo) it arguably has the most content. TM2 has 3 enviornments (soon to be 4), TMT has the same 4 enviornments (reskinned as a spinoff), and TMU has 7. There's tons of tracks for each and they all have their own unique physics:-Stadium: One of the best-feeling envoirnments in the game. Stadium cars are quick, grippy, and honestly feel more grounded in reality than any of the other enviornments in the game. Not to say that I'm looking for realism in an arcade racer, just sayin. Stadium tracks demand precision, and merely grazing a wall is almost always a guarantee that you'll get a silver medal or lower.-Island: One of my personal favorites, Island cars are blazing fast and extremely drifty at high speeds. The tracks are wide with long turns to compensate, resulting in an enviornment that's a blast to drive in. Bonus, load up your favorite Ferrari skin and play Splash Wave or something in the background for some mock-OutRun fun.-Bay: Another one of my favorites, Bay cars are like a compromise between Stadium and Island. They demand the automotive dexterity of Stadium while still being almost as fast as Island. Also a lot of fun.-Snow: Snow cars are extremely grippy and can practically turn on a dime. These tracks tend to twist and snake around; don't expect a lot of straightaways, and always try to keep your eyes one corner ahead.-Rally: With scenery inspired by old rural Europe (I guess?), Rally cars are a little on the slow side and very easy to handle, and are actually a little grippier than you'd think on dirt surfaces. This is fine; you're still gonna have to pay attention to your line in order to nab those gold medals.-Desert: One of the less enjoyable enviornments in my opinion (but that's just me), Desert cars are a little awkward to get used to. You will get used to them, though, and they teach you to manage your speed as you corner, lest you lose traction and therefore valuable momentum.-Coast: My least favorite enviornment at first, Coast eventually grew on me. They're the slowest cars in the game, yet some of the hardest to control. Take a corner too fast or try to turn too hard and you start sliding, which will most likely result in that gold medal ghost cruising right past you. Where other enviornments teach you how to respond at high speeds, Coast demands patience and subtlety.Trackmania United's price tag can be a little steep when you consider it's age, but you ARE getting a ton of content. If you want to try it out first, the Stadium enviornment is available as a standalone game for free (Trackmania Nations), with a fully fleshed out singleplayer campaign, the powerful track editor, full mod support, and unlimited multiplayer. There's people out there that have logged hundreds and even thousands of hours in the free version of Stadium alone. Try that out, and if you want more, then buy United, which will give you full access to all of these features in the other 6 enviornments. United also features extra modes for a change of pace. There's the Platform mode that puts you on much more technical tracks where time isn't a factor; medals are awarded based on how many times you have to reset your car to get to the end. When was the last time you played a racing game as a platformer? It sounds gimmicky but it's actually really interesting. There's also Stunt mode, which gives you a time limit to do flips and spins to get as many points as you can, and Puzzle mode, where the game gives you an unfinished track and gives you a limited number of extra track pieces, and you have to figure out how to arange them to make the track doable. All of this, combined with the track editor, the thousands of player-created tracks to download and enjoy, and both local and online multiplayer modes makes Trackmania United one of the most expansive racing games you will ever play. You can play it how you want; turn off the opponent cars and casually try to make it to the end of a track, shoot for gold or even Nadeo medals, or even compete in asynchronous multiplayer on the singleplayer tracks by doing official races to submit your best time to the global leaderboards. You can treat United like you'd treat Nations by spending all of your time exploring the wealth of content in your favorite enviornment, or become a jack of all trades and master every car's unique driving style. There's something for everybody. I've had the game for 3 days and I've already logged over 10 hours. I know I'm gonna sink many more into this game.TL;DRTrackmania United is purely a time trial game at heart. When judged by those standards, in my opinion it is one of the only games I would ever award the title of ""flawless"" to. If you want a time trial game, or even if you're just looking for the best Trackmania game, look no further. Trackmania United is among the best of the best.			",110,8,17,3,3,0,0

												10 Years and still going strong.  IMO, the best racing game out there... still.This game is bigger outside of the US than it is inside the US.  Most of the servers you will play on (which all host unique custom races) will be outside of the US.  If you are worried about lag, don't be, as the gameplay isn't like a standard racing game.  You start a track with a specific time limit.  You can run the track as many times as you can within this time limit.  In the end, the person who managed to run the course the fastest on any given run, is the winner.  There is no collision with other players in this game, and once you play some of the tracks out there, you will know why.  It wouldn't be possible to complete them any other way.I would describe this style of racing game as a twitch racer.  If you're good at racing games and looking for a real challenge, this is it.

												Need for Speed? You'll go fast. You'll get over 800 km/h sometimes.There's a reason why 97 % people recommened this game. It's just that good. You can play in 7 enviroments that feel completely different. Each enviroment also has their own vehicle which you can paint to your liking. You have over 400 races, platforms, stunts, and puzzles to beat.The game may seem really hard at first, but you'll get used to it quite fast. Some tracks are fairy easy, while others provide extreme challange, and to get golden medal (highest reward you can get for each track), you'll need to play it litterally 50 times to get beat golden medal requirements.While graphics do look outdated compared to modern games, the gameplay is perfect, and could hardly be any better, so don't worry too much about that.If you are into making your own tracks, this is the best game out there to do so. You can make tracks for all 7 enviroments. There is simple editor to get used to basics, and once you get used to it, there is very, very complex editor that allows you to everything with all objects in the game.Multiplayer is still active. It offers tons of superb custom made tracks that will provide additional challange.The specs for the game are very, very low for nowadays PC gaming standards, and don't worry about compatibility. The game runs great on Windows 10 (I play it on 10 myself).If you have never played Trackmania game, you should try this one even if you don't like racing. It's really fun game to play. If you have already played other Trackmania games, you should buy it too because it's currently the best one you can get. It offers so much content, that even though it's almost 10 years old, it's still worth the asking price.The only people that shouldn't buy this game, are people who have played Trackmania games before, and didn't enjoy them. It's unlikely that you will like this one, if you didn't like the other ones.You can try how game feels for free, as stadium enviroment is available for free here:Have fun and get gut.

There is so much that goes into this game. you can have so much fun playing the single player tracks and earning medals, also as you learn the ""bugs"" which will benefit alot once you become a better player and understand more about the physics ..then taking all this into multiplayer and it will become very addictive! Taking this one step further in hosting servers and you will be hooked like I was for years!

												This game isn't a racing game like all others. Trackmania has its own things that makes it a special racing game - the physics for time attacking.You can ride with cars over nice maps build by Nadeo, or a community on 7 different environments. Collect medals by improving your time. Chase your friends to see who's better driver. Build your own maps and share your maps with others, for example on tm-exchange.com. There's a lot of stuff you can do related to cars.True, you can do all of this in Nations, but United is another big expirience of driving with different cars and enjoying their unique environments. Please don't waste your money on this game because of Coppers support, it's stupid.Now my review:Gameplay (6 points max):There are no car collisions, which is the biggest thing that makes this a time attacking game.  Simple to understand, drive from start to finish in a fastest time, or drive multiple laps on multilap track. That's all you need to know. Car physics itself are REALLY good. 7 enviroments with different cars means 7 different car physics. The car react just as you press the key and it's possible to understand how the car works. Obviously you need to play for some time to be good at driving. Hard to tell if it's good idea to spend some months to skill yourself for such a dead game, because there are no competitions atm, but you can still rank up in official rankings of Solo tracks.Because cars are sometimes buggy and time attack can result some unlucky moments, I'm rating it 5.5/6.Graphics (3 points max):Graphics. They're old for sure, but quite good on it's release date. Anyways it isnt really close to today game's graphics. When you look at the game, it's a game where environment (not gameplay environment) really matters.Hard to decide, but I'm rating it 1.75/3.Atmosphere (1 point max):This game has it's own atmosphere, like most of the games. But this one brings memories of older games like 2004-2008 - their graphics bugs, simple design, gameplay. If you played older versions of Trackmania like Sunrise or Original, then you'll understand the feeling. :D Anyway I think it deserves clean 1 point. It isn't messy game with all kinds of things that don't fit together.So my rating is (5.5 + 1.75 + 1): 8.25/10I'll say it simply, this game is awesome. This rating comparing to today games is very very good on 2008 game.Community is very VERY friendly. Trackmania has one of the friendliest communities ever. From my expirience, I have no doubt of that. :D United community is dying (actually it's pretty dead now), but you can still meet some players around the servers and things.You want to decide if to buy this game for 30 bucks or stay at Nations. It's simple: Do you want to try something new in a game you know? For myself I really enjoyed playing all of these enviroments and I'm still enjoying that! But if you're not really into trying other 6 environments for this amount of money (I understand, it's a lot), then don't go for it.Overall I of course recommend this game. Absolutely no doubts about that. If you're trying to find a solid multienvironmental racing game rather for singleplayer purposes, this can be a good choice for you. :)			",38,5,5,3,7,2,1

												This game is the paid full version of Trackmania Nations Forever, for all intents and purposes. If you're thinking about buying United, but you're on the fence, play Nations Forever first. The real question worth answering is: should I upgrade to this game, or just stick with Nations Forever?In short, get it if: You want to avoid the multiplayer limitations in TMNF You want more single-player tracks You want to become more competitive in multiplayer, or in single-player time trial You don't mind the bugs in TMNFmultiplayer limitations in Nations ForeverIn Nations Forever, there are a few multiplayer limitations added to the game that incentivise players to upgrade - the most obvious being: you can only go on FreeZone servers; car skins are not visible to other players; and every fifth track you will be relegated to being a spectator.Spectating every fifth track can be pretty annoying, especially if you were hoping to play a specific track but need to sit out. Also, the chat is disabled when you are 'FreeZoned', which is unnecessary and frustrating. If you are into the multiplayer, this will probably be the biggest advantage that United has over Nations Forever.single-player tracksUnited adds a boat load more single-player tracks over Nations Forever (which still has quite a lot)! It also adds some legacy environments to the game, which are probably familiar to the player of older TM games (Sunrise, woo!). Bear in mind that the cars handle really differently in the other environments, so it can be a little jarring to play them.on competitivenessI don't really play competitive, but the single-player leaderboard system is really expanded in United, showing (as in the later games) your placement among your peers. Of course, if you play multiplayer, the far more important aspect is that you can join any server rather that those in the FreeZone.bugsThis game is really old. And it includes content from games older still. If you find bugs in TMNF, don't expect them to be fixed in United.All in all, it is a great game, and whether you get United, stick with Nations Forever, or buy a newer Trackmania, you'll still get a great and addictive racing game.

												Played this game since 2009, I probably wasted about 700 hours in it, I didn't use Steam back then. The game is absolutely amazing! It features all the environments (different playstyles basically) from the original Trackmania, Trackmania Sunrise and Trackmania Nations. I don't think it is worth buying as a standalone game nowadays, as the community is pretty much dead. It is a great addition to the ""Celebrat10n TrackMania Complete Pack"", however, and I recommend to check it out alongside with TrackMania 2 titles if you like competitive racing games.

												First things first. You probably want to know if Trackmania is even worth buying, right ? Don't lie to yourself. Good. Ok, let me tell you; it's worth it. There. I said it. So what's the difference between this game and the free one ? Honestly ? I have no idea. But it's such a fun game that you should go and buy it anyway to support the developers for even creating games like these, and to do yourself a favor of course. For those who don't know what Trackmania is all about; you basically drive a car (no sims here, it's all arcade racing) and have to beat the lap times. Easy enough, right ? Well, anyone can win a bronze medal in this game. If you want the gold one you have to drive perfect though. You have to know when to slow down, where to jump, how to take corners, everything. THAT's the challenge. It's great ! And it's even more epic when you play this game 'with' your friends. Epic I tell you ![Rating: 85/100]			",1655,629,69,221,194,16,225

												Not entirely your conventional racing game, and this one is free to download and comes with enough content to make you think you've downloaded a full game.The gameplay is primarily a time attack kind of deal. While you can see other cars in multiplayer, you can't actually crash into them, unlike a game like Burnout for example. Your only focus is to complete a track as fast as possible... or in some cases just simply complete the track (believe me when I say this is NOT an easy thing to do all the time, particularly in the player created tracks).The premium ""Forever Star Edition"" version takes that free base content and then multiplies it tenfold, adding new racing vehicles with their own unique handling / track types / speed, and further expands upon the track creator also available in the free version.It's a free game, with a completely optional full version available on the side, and a track editor, what's not to recommend? Give it a shot.			",158,25,9,17,9,3,24

												You guys really must give this game a go. It is fast, furious and damned frustrating chasing the extra hundredths of a second needed to grab that next medal. The best part is that you can play a free version of Trackmania - ""Trackmania Nations"" - to test it out an the Stadium circuits and see if you like it, then you can jump right in and purchase the full version.World leaderboards and an extensive community for additional track downloads and on-line head to head match races add to the excitement.

												I played for all of 15 minutes so I would not like to leave a beautiful game with a bad review. Ran excellently on my medium tier Laptop at near max settings, I am howevercurrently requesting a refund due to the lack of controller support. I was surprised to find that my controller (an official windows 10/xbox one  controller) was not supported and from what I can gather, this game is only playable with the keyboard which on a laptop is pretty uncomfortable at times. Still, a wonderful game and a wonderful company.			",44,5,1,10,9,0,12

												I'm a long time TrackMania fan and I'm glad to see it on Steam, especially the United version. COMMUNITYThe community is small nowadays but very welcoming. One of the main selling points in my honest opinion is being in a game that people often congratulate each other after races whenever they get high records or just for the sake of a good round. I gotta say, this is a breath of fresh air in online communities and a very nice atmosphere to be a part of in a competitive game like this one.GAME MODESThere's 7 other modes available in the United version including Stadium, the ""generic"" one.It's kinda hard to find dedicated serves of anything other than Stadium and maybe Coast. After you reach 80k+ LP you might be able to join mixed servers with lots of Island, Rally and the other modes tracks. Anyway, I'll briefly describe them for ya: Stadium is the go-to mode for this game. High octane racing and sometimes even technical. Arcade Trackmania, ladies and gentlemen. Coast is my favorite mode. It's slowpaced in comparison to Stadium and you can feel the weight of your car really well. You drive on mainly offroad tracks and they're all amazing. Lots of memories playing Coast. Shout out to Coast players out there. You guys are rad. Island is pretty insane. Speed demons! Island is quite challenging and frustrating as well. Handling those speedsters is no easy task. Desert is like being in Dukes of Hazzard. Watch out for corners, otherwise you're gonna find yourself upside down at the end of every turn.  Rally is iffy to say the least. One of the modes nobody actually cares about it, or even knows it exist. You ""control"" a tiny car that doesn't understand the concept of balance. It'll take you patience to handle those devilspawns. Snow can be pretty damn fun and challenging as well. It's mostly a mixture of Rally and Desert. Once you figure out how to get around corners with these bobcats you're good to go! Bay rocks! Acceleration is the name of the game. I love how these cars handle, and it's so good once you're nailing every corner going faster than the speed of sound.NEGATIVE POINT. YES, ONLY ONE POINTI'll be honest with you - the only one negative point of TrackMania nowadays is its popularity. United used to be full of players, but right now things aren't going so well. What happened? Well, you see, there's a free version of this game called Nations. In Nations you can only play Stadium. Fair, right? Yes, but Nadeo didn't think so. A few years ago Nadeo had a great idea. ""What if we implemented a FreeZone system, which basically restrict every free player of playing 1 or 2 tracks in a row and pushes them into a queue, waiting a round to play again?"" ""Genius!""(TrackMania Nations only, if you own United you're good to go.)This FreeZone ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ almost killed this game, but the players found a way around that and trust me - this game is a LOT of fun, with tor without the United license. Give it a shot on sale. Trackmania Turbo is okay too, but, United is where Trackmania really shines. ",743,227,42,77,49,12,91

												Has more in common with mario kart than with forza. If you're looking for a serious racing game, this isn't it... but if you've already beaten plants vs. zombies and peggle and are looking for something mindless to do while listening to audio books, this will fit the bill perfectly.The only multiplayer mode is concurrent time trials, which works quite well. Since you're mainly racing the clock, you can restart the race at any time and won't be unduly affected by lag or cheats. However, the lack of variety means the game itself won't hold your interest for long unless you're playing with friends or also listening to podcasts at the same time.All cars in a given race mode handle exactly the same. There is no car customization outside of your car's paint and model, but that's quite fun in itself. No plot. None of the annoying interruptions that are so common in other racing games such as cutscenes, slow menus, and crash cams. You can jump directly from one lap to the next. There is a 1 minute delay between races every time the server switches tracks, but otherwise the fun is uninterrupted.There is a huge number of tracks but all are constructed from the same set of sections, so the variety is limited. Most tracks can be driven fairly close to top speed for most of the race - late braking isn't a part of the game. The game is mainly about finding the shortest path through the track that doesn't result in a crash.The free version requires spectating every few races but otherwise gets access to most of the content. This isn't pay-to-win. Free players don't play at a disadvantage. I paid for the full version and I found it to be worth the price in order to play uninterrupted. Paid players also get access to several other modes including many tracks, different track types, and a new type of car for each track type. Unfortunately, the paid servers are normally empty so you'll still spend most of your time racing the same tracks as the free players.If you think of this as a casual game, you'll get some fun out of it. If you're looking for a realistic driving sim, look elsewhere. ",404,137,12,41,55,6,68

												Trackmania is a fun single player game with an additional multiplayer mode. For the most part, you'll probably be playing the single player, but it's vast enough to give you hours of entertainment and variety with all of the cars, tracks, and game types.The game also comes with a track editor which allows you to create your own tracks for all of the available car types. These tracks can be played alone, with friends through the multiplayer mode or passed on to others so they can try your tracks.If you like arcade racers and flying through the air, this game is definitely for you.Additionally, if you don't feel like buying the game, you can play the free version that works just as well without the bells and whistles.

												Trackmania is the kind of game that always slips under the US radar. It's most popular in Europe, due to Nadeo being a French company.But let me get this straight with you: You're missing out if you're not buying this, or at least trying the free Trackmania Nations.Not only is it a racing game, it's a racing game where you can make your own tracks. And the track editor isn't a piece of junk, either - it has tons of options, leading to a world of possibilities. If making tracks isn't your thing, though, there are plenty of challenges to beat from Nadeo and the Trackmania community. Plus, there are 7 environments with 7 different vehicles, each of which handle very differently. Couple that with online play that's still going after all these years after release, and you've got a winner.Seriously, at least try out Nations. It's free, and it's worth your while, even with one environment. But once you're ready to take it a step further, remember this review.			",23,2,1,3,1,1,3

												Let me start off by saying that the Trackmania games were my childhood. Me and my cousin spent hours racing, building tracks, and competing for the quickest times across the original game. Then Trackmania Sunrise came out, and the magic seemed to happen all over again. Eventually we got older, began to hang out less (We lived a good distance away), and started to move on with our lives. A few years ago, we found Trackmania Nations. It didn't quite feel the same, but it was almost a return. Just recently I purchased Trackmania United Forever Star Edition (TU), as I realized that it seemed to have the vehicles and environments from the original games! I eagerly downloaded it, watching as the percentage slowly inched up. When it finally finished, I quickly hit play, loaded into the game, and got myself into a race in the desert environment of the original Trackmania.""Wow, I could have sworn it looked better when I was a kid."" I told myself upon being greeted by incredibly bad graphics.  Whatever, my nostalgia for the game made me see it better than it was. That's my fault.But wait. It wasn't my fault. The game's screenshots showed it looking a lot better! Even the Stadium environment looked much worse on United than on Nations! ""Trackmania United blurry textures"" were the words I fed into Google. Well, I started to. The term was already one of the suggested search terms, along with several other versions of the phrase, reworded in various ways. This was a problem all across the community! I began to follow whatever guides I found, hoping I could fix my game and get back to my childhood. Nadeo held a place in my heart, so I was pretty forgiving.None of them worked! I tried adjusting the Distro and installing a patch! I tried all the methods people suggested. But none of them worked.I still can't find a solution. I've validated the files, deleted and reinstalled, tried every guide I could find.Ultimately, this is why I'm leaving a negative review. This glitch has been around for years. I believe the earliest time someone asked about the glitch was 2010! Yet Nadeo has not fixed it, and eight years later, I doubt they will.If you buy this game, make sure your computer is not on Windows 8.1 (That seems to be the OS installed on a lot of computers that have the issue and can't fix it). I can't even give a specific set of graphics cards that might trigger the glitch, because they were all over the place. Or just be safe, dont buy it.			",351,87,10,27,42,2,28

												This game WAS fun. Years ago. When there were decent tracks, competing teams and nations etc. I couldn't stop playing it back then. Now there are only retaredd track with dead-ends, cross-junctions, parts which are there only to mislead you, and ways for you to screw up. Unless you spent a few hours learning them. But who the hell wants to spend hours to learn only ONE track in an arcade game?There are no fun tracks any more just crazy mazes maing the whole game tedious and no fun at all. There are no variety in the tracks either. All are about blindly avoiding obstacles you must learn are there. No tracks which require knowledge of the car, precision driving or any other skill than memorizing one stupid obstacle after another. I had more fun on the training traks than on anything available for multiplayer racing now.Unfortunately, this game lost its former charm :(Oh yeah! Did I mention that badly optimized graphics can waste even a high-end GPU if oyu want to queeze any decent graphichs level?			",9,1,4,1,3,0,4

Tried contacting Ubisoft, they said they can't do anything.Tried contacting Nadeo, they said they don't know what to do.$30 wasted - seems like this game is old enough to the point where the developers don't particularly care about this game anymore.

Originally posted by Jeremy Clarkson: Speed is powerThis game is all about speed. Cars go woosh, tires burn their rubber on the tracks and their smell intoxicates the driver. Why then, that every server I've been on has maps made by people who actively hate drivers? I want to race, not navigate a maze.Nadeo should take hold of this gaming community with an iron fist, too long has it gone to chaos without the rule of law. Only maps with left turns should be allowed, the Nascar standard. Talk to me about Formula 1 racing and I'll cut you open, Euro trash.			",279,32,8,34,25,3,42

												360 gamepad controls are jerky and over-sensitive. Even if you turn the deadzone up and sensitivity all the way down, it's still way too touchy. There's also no way to map the triggers to accel and brake, so there's no analogue speed control. There are no setup options, no manual shifting, it's just stop or go.Most tracks are start here, finish there (A to B) rather than having laps like a normal racing game. The stunts are cool, but most races are over in less than 2 minutes so you don't really get to enjoy the driving that much, unless you're trying to get a gold medal, then you're just going to be repeating the same short run over and over. All opponents (AI or players) are ghost cars. To unlock the higher tier tracks require you to get at least Gold on the previous, but because the controls are so touchy and jerky, it can be a pretty tall order.I don't get why this game is so popular. It's expensive for being so old and simplistic. It would be nice to have a good stunt car game on Steam. There really hasn't been one since Stunts or Stunt Driver, so I guess this (or the sequels) would be it. You can make your own tracks and paint your cars, so that's a plus.It's a good game if you're looking for something simple and over the top. It's just racing - no cops, no boosts, no setups or car tuning, no cockpit view (just two chase and one bumper cam). Not all tracks have jumps and loops, but most do. It's a good game, but I can't recommend it at the current price point.			",464,85,34,90,83,1,92

												While the Stadium environment is free and probably has rather more content, United adds several interesting modes, each with their own unique gameplay elements. My personal favorites are the ridiculously fast and showy Island environment and the slower, but more technical Snow environment. Between its low system requirements, simple gameplay, high skill cap, and the robust track editors, I'd say this is a worthy purchase. Then again, Nations Forever was basically a full game's worth of content for free - with this, you're getting more variety in all ways.			",86,16,8,10,12,0,20

												This is probably the greatest arcade racer I have ever played. The graphics are outstanding, the editors are innovative and the gameplay types cater to just about eveyone. The controll scheme is simple and extremely responsive, which makes the high speed tracks all the more fun to play on. Out of all the racing games I have played, this one is probably the best.

												Note that there's a free version on Steam called Trackmania Nations Forever. Compared to United, Nations is (I think) restricted to one racing mode and one themed set of tracks/cars. It's a great demo, actually a pretty great game in itself... no reason not to try it!I've mostly just played Trackmania singleplayer, in time-trial mode (same mode as in Nations). The races are short, some of the early ones just a few seconds long. Restarting a race is instant. Typically when you're aiming for a gold medal time you will restart whenever you make a mistake, trying over and over for the perfect clean run.I don't really get into some of the massive-retries games like Trials or Super Meat Boy, but for some reason Trackmania hits the spot. Maybe because it's so colorful, fast, and generally gonzo. If games have mottos, Trackmania's is ""WHEEEEEEEEE!"". :-)Update: this is also a surprisingly great LAN party game, especially in ""rounds"" mode.			",279,59,9,20,15,2,40

												I remember getting the very first Trackmania game way back when, and I would beg my parents to connect to the slow as heck dial-up internet to play online. It was great fun. I also played Trackmania Sunrise as well, and had even more fun.Trackmania United Forever is the complete package of what I would call the 'First Generation' of Trackmania games. United puts all the previous games together into one package: Trackmania, the original game with its desert, snow and grassland biomes, Sunrise, with the Island, Coast and Bay biomes, and Nations, the Free-2-Play version of the game with the single Stadium biome. This game is the one you get if you want everything in one place.The multiplayer is still incredibly active, and as it's a Time-attack mode, there is no lag on your side. You will see other players bundle together and teleport across the map like the worst lag you'll imagine, but since it's technically asynchronous, and you're racing for the fastest time as opposed to all at once, the lag has zero effect on gameplay.One critique that I would offer is that multiplayer gameplay does have a higher framerate issues, which will effect gameplay. You may need to mess with graphics settings in order to get the game running as smooth as possible.But the main appeal of the game is the level editor. Now, I'm not the most into level editing, but I do enjoy playing other people's levels, and with the multiplayer mode, there is essentially an unlimited amount of levels to play after you finish the official levels of the single-player campaigns, of which there is more than enough.So yes, I do recommend this game, but what about the later titles in the franchise, you may be wondering?Well, to be honest, I don't know. Trackmania 2 is incredibly fragmented, as someone decided it would be a good idea to sell each biome separately, and I haven't played Turbo, the newest installment, but reviews are looking like it's more dumbed down than prior versions. I do like the idea of the randomly-generated levels Turbo has to offer, but I'm not sure if it's enough of a selling point.Overall, Trackmania is a great racing game for your arcade-y needs. It's not a simulator of any sort, it's more of a fantasy stunt racer.			",281,40,4,32,38,1,25

												Back when I first tried it out, TrackMania wasn't a game I was expecting to get addicted to. My friend's cousin was playing a free demo of it and my friend thought I might enjoy it. I did, a bit too much.So what is TrackMania? As you can probably tell, it's a racing game. However, it is much different from most other racing games. Let's start with what it doesn't do: it doesn't use real-life cars, it doesn't simulate accurate physics, it doesn't aim to bring real courses to life, and it doesn't even let you collide with other cars.So it's an arcade racer, then? Yes, but not in the traditional sense. There's no items to speak of, most courses aren't lapped, multiplayer is generally asynchronous, and courses are 100% static.That might not sound like a lot of fun, but that's the baseline for what fuels this racer to be all fun. In most cases, you won't be driving on bland tracks. No ovals here; you get twisting loops, skybound jumps, and even ridiculous wallrides. No collisions means that you just need to worry about taking the track as fast as possible. Remember those jumps I mentioned? You don't get a lot of room for error sometimes, so a slight tap could throw you hurdling off into no-man's land.This also sets the stage for pure skill. In all courses, you are already given the car to drive. You just need to deliver it to the end as fast as you can. No items and no collisions means no meddling with others, so all you have to blame for a poor time is yourself. When thing's come down to split seconds, you'll be glad you just need to worry about hitting the drift at the right time and not if you'll ram into some poor sap trying to pass.Speaking of cars, TrackMania United is split into 7 different environments (one of which is featured in the free demo I mentioned earlier). From the slow and slippery Coast car to the ludicrously fast Island car, that's 7 unique vehicles to master. They never feel like tweaked copies, either. The Desert car tilts when turning, the Snow car is great at keeping speed but terrible at accelerating, and the Stadium car has so many tricks you'll be hard pressed to find them yourself.As if that wasn't enough, Nadeo decided ""Hey, let's just let the players make whatever they want."" With the already amazing gameplay you also get a bunch of editors to suit your needs; make your own courses to blast through, paint your cars in your own patterns, and shoot videos of your best runs (or fails). And if you have the know-how, you can even make your own car models (which don't affect driving) and reskin your courses to use completely different textures.Honestly, the map editor is what keeps me coming back the the TrackMania titles. While the default maps (of which there are hundreds of) are certainly fun to play, the game really shines when you take a look at some of the creations players have made. Heck, there's even a map sharing database[www.tm-exchange.com] with its own monthly map making contest[united.tm-exchange.com]!I know it shows its age, but I can promise you that this is some of the most fun you'll ever have in a racing game.You can try out the demo here, which is basically the full game but just featuring one of the seven environments: ",102,20,6,5,8,1,12

												Been a huge fan of Trackmania since the original. This game is amazing, and totally worth every penny considering the huge amount of content you get for it. With the Forever Star Edition, you get to race in 7 environments, compared to just the one Stadium environment in Nations. Each environment has its own style of tracks and its own vehicle, which all handle very differently. For example, the Stadium racecar handles decently and can go pretty fast, while the Snow truck has barely any acceleration at all, but has huge handling capability. With this game, you get everything in the free Nations version (which has at least 100 or so tracks if I recall correctly), along with the United expansion, containing a metric ton of tracks from the 6 other environments it adds (Island, Desert, Snow, Rally, Coast, and Bay) in a variety of gamemodes. And Trackmania just isn't Trackmania without the Track Builder. It does take a little getting used to, but once you've figured it out, it's very fun to make your own tracks and publish them to the community via Manialinks. If making tracks wasn't enough, you can also make custom paintjobs for your cars as well. Online racing is very fun, and there's always a bunch of servers with people playing. The online servers might have a lot of UI that might look like a bit much to take in, but you can customize it if you like. The community is friendly for the most part, too, which is a huge plus considering the state of some communities nowadays. All in all, this is a great game for casuals and competitive types alike. Would easily recommend.			",132,6,10,3,14,2,3

												I never really liked racing games. Then my friends forced me to try Trackmania Nations (which is free). A few years later, I have collected every gold medals in Trackmania United (which is not free).This game is exactly my kind of game. It's incredibly easy to play (but takes a lot of time to play right) and the tracks are very fun. It's incredibly funny to watch all those other cars crashing all around you in multiplayer.You have ten minutes to lose ? Why not play a little track ?Two hours to lose ? Make that three.A game that you can play like you eat popcorn ot that you can appreciate like a fine wine.Just a piece of advice: you need to be patient. But then you will see yourself getting better every day. And that's far more gratifying than grinding or getting a better gear.			",72,40,2,24,5,0,13

												just about the best game ever madeScrew all that Trackmania 2 ♥♥♥♥, this is where it's at. People actually play this game. Granted most of those people are actually playing the free to play Trackmania Nations servers.Whatever though the extra environments you get from paying for United are worth it, and there are a decade's worth of custom tracks out there for people to race on. You could spend days just hopping around all the different servers out there and hardly ever see the same track twice.I mean what other game out there has the amount of custom content out there that this does?Also play with a controller, it's way cooler. Although back in the day I was pretty sick with a keyboard, it's definitely a different skill set. There's still a competitive scene out there too. I've seeing some pretty intense twitch streams for this game.This game was esports before esports was cool. Be a cool dude, buy Trackmania.Also the word dude is gender neutral, I live in Los Angeles so I would know.			",277,71,19,25,31,1,16

												Probably the best version of TrackMania out there, this simply controlled game comes with nVidias first version of 3D mode (Red/Blue) and is compatible with nVidias current Active LCD 3D.It features a ridiculously easy track builder and allows you to be ranked from anywhere from world rank down to town rank.  A definite must-have game.			",761,180,20,124,88,4,128

												Trackmania United is quite fun to play. Before I bought United I've spent alot of time on the free to play Nations. Nations is practically United but your restricted to just the Stadium environment.United offers an additional 6 themes, with United you'll be able to race and design tracks in Snow, Desert, Rally, Bay, Island, Coast and Stadium environments and I'll tell you now. The Island car is insanely fast compaired to the Stadium car.But if you're looking for multiplayer servers with any other theme but Stadium, good luck with that because United shares it's multiplayer with Nations and it's very rare to find a Non-Stadium server but, of course, if you've got friends who plays United then you could always arrange a meet-up.The simple but advanced grid based track editor shouldn't be too hard if you've got experience from Nations, but with the additon of 6 more environments to play with, each with their own sets of track pieces, offers more variety for your creativity to work with.So really United is a Nations upgrade. You can play Nations to try out Trackmania and if you enjoy it. Then consider United if you want more. Trying out Nations is probably the best thing you can do because as I've noticed, United has never had its price cut in a sale.			",46,5,8,3,34,2,18

												Simply put: this game is endless fun. The track editor is powerful but extremely easy to use, which means that creating complex, professional tracks takes almost no time at all. It's a lot of fun to just mess around until something coherent comes together (story of my life :P). The livery editor is nice, but it could definitely use a few more features, like the ability to move the brush pixel by pixel instead of just moving it around with the cursor, as well as the ability to rotate the brush and stickers (putting stickers on your car can be exasperating as FRICK lol). That said, you can still make a lot of cool designs in the livery editor.The controls are tight and beautifully responsive, and using a keyboard is just as good as using a controller (I actually prefer the keyboard to the controller when it comes to this game).As if tight controls and a fantastic track editor weren't enough, TrackMania United Forever Super Special Star Iloominarty Gaben Edition is one of those games that can run on a potato, which means you'll be able to at least run it on crappy specced PCs, and you'll be able to crank the graphics settings and not have to worry about the framerate at all on even mid-range PCs.Overall, I would DEFINITELY recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a good racing game on PC. And if you're not sure if you'll like it, TrackMania United is FREE (it's the full game with only the Stadium car and track style to choose from). This game easily gets 9 Gabens out of 10!

												Don't let the 23H of TMUnited take away from this review, I have over 1000 hours into TMNations, the free version.This is hands down the best and most competitive racing game I've played. With people constantly making new tracks, there's always something new to play. It just never gets old. For the same reason CS still exists in it's capacity. Trackmania will forever be the best racing game on the PC.			",67,5,10,5,4,1,10

												Nighthawk's Score: 8.5/10Great racing game. No collisions so it's just you vs. the track vs. other players times. We've been playing it for over a year at work.

												Despite the unusually high price tag of $40, I've enjoyed this game more than any racing game on PC, making tracks is fun as hell, and the online time-trial based racing on anyone's tracks is usually extremely fun, as is the well balanced offline portion of the game. And there's SO MUCH STAT TRACKING. The only issue I have with it is that hardly anyone actually plays United, most people play the free version, Nations, which only has one track type, Stadium. There are, I believe, five or six on Nations... which you hardly get to race on cause the two games share servers. Either way, get Trackmania, be it the free one (Nations) or the pay one (United).

												Trackmania United Forever Star Edition. Uhhh I don't think it was even called that when I bought it. I forget how I bought it. Did I get the free version and then upgrade it, or did I just buy the paid version regular-like? I don't know, the lifespan and naming conventions of this game are confusing as hell. Good thing it's so fun. I really fondly remember playing regular old Trackmania United online, racing on random servers on player-created tracks, in a friendly environment fostering healthy real-time time trials competition without inspiring extremely heated competition. I haven't done that in a long time, but there's a bunch of singleplayer races too, in a number of different types of vehicle which all handle completely differently, and all of which can be freely painted! There's a sequel now I guess, but I haven't heard much about it one way or another, so maybe just get this.			",209,15,8,13,11,3,29

												The basic premise of the game is your controlling a racecar in some of the craziest and wildest tracks you’ve ever experienced.  If anyone has ever tried out electric slot cars, remote control cars or even the new mini RC cars, TrackMania offers a similar experience.  You’ll experience giant jumps, insane turns, and tracks set in unique locations such as a castle, the desert or on ice.  You’ve got to keep an eye out on the track, because you never know what could be coming up at the next corner.Fast, fun and entertaining gameplay is what gaming is all about.  TrackMania is another welcomed addition to our world of entertaining PC games.  From the great graphics, fun gameplay, and amazing concept, TrackMania provides a might punch in a small package.  However, the repetitive music and repetitive gameplay might leave some gamers looking for the brake pedal.  TrackMania should provide enough entertainment value to keep gamers driving for a long time to come.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ahhh, TrackMania United, the perfect arcade-based racing game. I really don't know where to start this. Off the bat, TM: United is an arcade racing game, where you build tracks, perform loop-de-loops, crazy stunts, jumps, and tricks. This game houses several environments to race in (with Stadium being the most popular), and different cars for each environment (some cars may have better handling than overs, however most often the cars are tuned to the environment's racing style). The game's racing action is fairly solid, so handling and steering shouldn't be an issue (except on Coast, if you aren't familiar with rally racing). The track editor is also very intensive and detailed (if you click the Advanced editor anyway). The track pieces pretty much go together like lego bricks, so the only way you can mess up a track is if you happen to forget a track piece to add in, or perhaps overshoot/undershoot your car's speed for jumps or sideways tracks. Believe me though, if you spend enough time in that editor, you can pretty well make some very challenging maps.In addition to making your own maps, you can even set times on them. You can race your own creations, and try to set the best time, so other people can try to beat your time on your track. You can also choose to share your maps either via TMX (a website that specializes in maps for all the TrackMania titles), or via a Manialink (an in-game, hub store where users can upload their creations and buy them with in-game currency called credits (you cannot buy credits by the way, you earn them through logging in daily or by winning bets on the servers). The other thing about TrackMania is that there is a paint option, so you can pain your cars very extravagantly and make them unique. Optionally, there's also user-made skins on TrackMania Carpark and on several Manialinks you can download. So if you feel like that old Stadium car is looking boring, you can download a BMW Z4 or a Mario Kart, or even one of the vehicles from F-Zero and race that instead.Finally, the community of the game. I will admit off hand, I have logged a good lot of time into this game (was even playing its freeware version TrackMania Nations before I bought United), and in that time, it's tough to find good people there. To sum it up, you might not be that happy if you are a North American player, since the North American community (which is VERY small), tends to rank up on the global leaderboards in the top 10,000-100,000 range. While this may seem intimidating, there's also the EU community (which is VERY large), which can be ranked anywhere from the top 100,000-12 million range. Due to the wider range in the EU community, you might have better odds at placing in events on the EU servers over the North American ones (since the NA servers are few and far inbetween). On the upside though, your car doesn't crash into other players, so the only way you'll end up crashing is by human error.However, if you don't quite want to roll with the multiplayer crowd, there is still the singleplayer, time trial maps you can play to earn medals (which do boost your ranking to some degree). Some of them can get very hard to beat, but it's still a good challenge if you feel like doing those sorts of games. All in all, the game can be praised for it's creative prowess in regards to track building and racing, as well as the graphics too (which are still incredibly good despite the game's age). The multiplayer community might leave you wanting to have competition that isn't so incredibly skilled so you can have a chance to place, but the content that the community still pushes out is still impressive nonetheless, and still keeps me coming back for more. To summarize, I recommend this game if you are the type that likes a good arcade racer with solid controls, and the ability to create maps.			",53,6,13,1,4,0,0

												Trackmania United is definitely one of the best arcade racing games that is on offer on Steam! It's literally the Counter-Strike of racing games - highly competitive, yet welcoming to casual players. In order to be good, you need to be very skilfull as the game basically revolves around time trials and replaying levels over and over in order to get the best time. But if the competitive side is not for you, don't worry, because you can still play this game at a casual level and have a blast!The visuals hold up really well considering the game's age. It is partly a compilation of the original Trackmania, Trackmania Sunrise, and Nations Forever (which is free and brings Stadium into the mix). I would recommend playing with a controller as the controls can be a bit twitchy for some car types - of which there are seven: Rally, Snow, Desert, Bay, Coast, Island, and Stadium. The sounds are decent, and the music isn't terrible, but I personally prefer playing with the music off and my own music playing instead.In terms of what there is to offer, you can go straight into the multiplayer or you can start out on the Singleplayer levels. These come in a variety of forms, such as races on any of the environments or stunt, platforming, and puzzle events in the Stadium (you can also race in Stadium). As I said, these are based around getting the best time possible, so there is a lot of replayability in these levels! Apart from that you have a bunch more Stadium tracks and also some ""Star Edition"" tracks to add to the already-considerably-large amount of tracks in the game. And if that doesn't top it off, there is an in-game track editor that allows for you to create your own tracks or even play other people's!! (You can also download custom skins for your cars off the web if you're interested...)The multiplayer is great fun too as it can be very competitive or really entertaining to spectate others playing the game. Overall it's a fantastic game and one of the best racers on PC, so if that's what you're into then this is a must-buy for you!Enjoy! :D			",775,155,50,97,56,10,92

												I loved this game when I fist played it. It has all the cars from the earlier trackmania games but new tracks. The tracks are awesome you can be travelling at ridiculous speeds,driving on the walls, going through loop the loops and making epically big jumps all in the same track. However once I had gone through all the tracks and got good times I lost interest. I just not the type of person who wants to spend hours repeatedly doing the same track trying to shave off a few hundredths of a second to get the next medal. This game is much more heavily slanted to wards multiplayer gaming which is not my cup of tea either.			",128,95,10,4,4,1,8

												This is an extremely addictive racing game that offers many modes to choose from. My favorite part is that you dont only represent your country in this game, but also your  state, and even city.  Compete, literally, with racers from multiple countries simultaneously and watch as each scrambles to the top of the well kept leaderboards. Personally, I enjoy the more hotwheels like tracks, but the adrenaline rush from the high speed time trials is what makes this game really shine.			",63,9,3,10,4,1,9

												This game has so much variety it's hard to write a review in limited space. At core the game combines the mechanics of a puzzler with a race driver, but the emphasis is squarely on the driving and the driving is FUN. Unfortunately there's little real racing going on since 90% of your time is spent in ""time attack"" mode, but online play allows for real-time competitive time attack. There's a bazillion user created racetracks to download and master on top of the built in designs and your success earns money allowing you to buy new cars, track elements. There are seven different track environments and seven car types which are uniquely challenging, and the design of the tracks can become absolutely diabolical when gunning for a perfect score. As a break from beating the existing tracks you can try building your own tracks through the money you've earned and see how creative you can get, it's like a kids slot car toy on steroids.Highly recommended!

												Certainly a unique title as no other racing game lets you create and play some pretty crazy circuits with cars flying everywhere so it is safe to say it does not fit in with your average realistic racer. The multiplayer feels more like you are racing against ghosts but if they didn't have this the collisions everywhere would drive you mad. Download Nations Forever for free if you are unsure.

												Fo real, this is always going to be a classic in my library, Trackmania United. The sheer fun physics and customizability of the cars and envirnments will always give drivers more and more hours of entertainment. After all this time being released up until 2014, the community will always surprise race gamers for both a need for absolute speed, and adrenaline of meeting other fellow racers. Really, this game has it all for a racing arcade game. Hella recommend this.			",19,1,2,1,2,0,0

												Remember STUNTS? Remember how in-between exploiting bugs for hilarious results there was a pretty ambitious racing game with the ability to create set pieces cooler than any Need For Speed or Burnout did, and all in 16 colors? Guess what, this is like that, but with good graphics and more set pieces. And that's just the part you get for free.The stuff you pay for are new environments that act completely different from eachother. Not only are there different cars, each with their own quirks, but each environment has its own unique set of tiles, from towering highways to slippery ice to dirt roads. Every single one of them is fun in their own way (except Coast, ♥♥♥♥ Coast) and to be honest, I'm pretty sure this has spoiled me on every other racing game sinc there's nothing on the market quite like it.

												I remember getting the very first Trackmania game way back when, and I would beg my parents to connect to the slow as heck dial-up internet to play online. It was great fun. I also played Trackmania Sunrise as well, and had even more fun.Trackmania United Forever is the complete package of what I would call the 'First Generation' of Trackmania games. United puts all the previous games together into one package: Trackmania, the original game with its desert, snow and grassland biomes, Sunrise, with the Island, Coast and Bay biomes, and Nations, the Free-2-Play version of the game with the single Stadium biome. This game is the one you get if you want everything in one place.The multiplayer is still incredibly active, and as it's a Time-attack mode, there is no lag on your side. You will see other players bundle together and teleport across the map like the worst lag you'll imagine, but since it's technically asynchronous, and you're racing for the fastest time as opposed to all at once, the lag has zero effect on gameplay.One critique that I would offer is that multiplayer gameplay does have a higher framerate issues, which will effect gameplay. You may need to mess with graphics settings in order to get the game running as smooth as possible.But the main appeal of the game is the level editor. Now, I'm not the most into level editing, but I do enjoy playing other people's levels, and with the multiplayer mode, there is essentially an unlimited amount of levels to play after you finish the official levels of the single-player campaigns, of which there is more than enough.So yes, I do recommend this game, but what about the later titles in the franchise, you may be wondering?Well, to be honest, I don't know. Trackmania 2 is incredibly fragmented, as someone decided it would be a good idea to sell each biome separately, and I haven't played Turbo, the newest installment, but reviews are looking like it's more dumbed down than prior versions. I do like the idea of the randomly-generated levels Turbo has to offer, but I'm not sure if it's enough of a selling point.Overall, Trackmania is a great racing game for your arcade-y needs. It's not a simulator of any sort, it's more of a fantasy stunt racer.			",281,40,4,32,38,1,25

												Even though it is 9 years old, Trackmania Forever has managed to sustain a considerably solid playerbase,as in you will always have at least a few servers to play on at any time givenThis game spits on Trackmania Turbo`s face,a shame to the quality of the older titlesI strongly recommend the game,and for those who are new to the series,try Trackmania Nations Forever,which is free on SteamAdvantages of United over Nations are :-No Freezone -Your custom car, avatar and horn are visible and audible to everyobdy playing-6 new environments to have fun in (Altough,I completely hate one of them,and you will have a hard time finding a server with more than 5 players in any of the environments except Stadium)-Copper system which allows you to replay tracks on the server (but it will take some time to aquire coppers)I wish Ubisoft gave more love to this title,its sooo underrated			",24,1,6,2,3,0,2

												I never really liked racing games. Then my friends forced me to try Trackmania Nations (which is free). A few years later, I have collected every gold medals in Trackmania United (which is not free).This game is exactly my kind of game. It's incredibly easy to play (but takes a lot of time to play right) and the tracks are very fun. It's incredibly funny to watch all those other cars crashing all around you in multiplayer.You have ten minutes to lose ? Why not play a little track ?Two hours to lose ? Make that three.A game that you can play like you eat popcorn ot that you can appreciate like a fine wine.Just a piece of advice: you need to be patient. But then you will see yourself getting better every day. And that's far more gratifying than grinding or getting a better gear.			",72,40,2,24,5,0,13
