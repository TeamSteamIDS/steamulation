												Trackmania Canyon is a really fun game, if you have ever played a Trackmania game you will find yourself at home. If online against others or alone, it is basically always you vs. the best time. There are no collisions, no agressive driving people smashing into you... just your own skill stands between you and the gold medal. ;)Highly recommended.			",415,84,25,40,52,4,66

												Let me explain something about this game. This game has a multiplayer that is NOT for the casual gamer. It is quite competitive, and it likes to display this competitiveness all up in yo' face. You WILL see that one dude (or multiple, I mean, they're everywhere) that can finish the track in half the time it takes you to finish it. I see this every other time I go onto this game.The game has a steep learning curve that requires at least an hour or more in order to learn the basic physics of the game. After that, there are tricks that, once learned, can help you set better times in the multiplayer. (i.e. Left-CTRL braking & using a controller.) The tracks in this game play a major role in shaping your skills, as they are user-created. They can go from being pretty basic to being some of the hardest tracks you'll encounter on your time here.I know very well that time makes all the difference in the multiplayer. In fact, it MEANS the difference. Times are what determine your position in a round, and the time is calculated in thousandths of a second, making photo finishes seem like nothing. You can set a record time in a single round, only for someone to beat you by .002. It really can be that close. There IS the odd tie, but it doesn't happen that often.Now, you should go into this game knowing that you're not gonna win your first race by a long shot. Practice makes perfect. It blends in the arcade-style driving physics and fantasy environment with a competitve multiplayer that stands with some of the best. I've never been so involved in a racing game that isn't a sim. Trackmania 2 also has its own ladder system, which determines how well you do amongst other players worldwide. And we're not only talking worldwide, either. It can track official progress to as close as your own state (if you live in the US, that is). You have a number for everything, from server rankings, to single player rankings, to country rankings. The better you do, the more the number goes down, and the more accomplished you feel.I recommend this game, because it makes the $20 you'll dump on this game worth the cost. Now, do mind, this was a game that was made BEFORE the UPlay era, so it doesn't require the UPlay launcher. Instead, it has its own launcher for launching titles, although it still is in need of serious revision. ",51,5,11,1,2,0,2

												Canyon is an arcade racer that consist of tracks that are somewhere between 20-30 seconds. You meet up online (or you can play against yourself) and everyone competes for the best time on each track. It's all about nailing those perfect drifts and jumps so you can shave milliseconds of your time. You can instantly restart at the push of a button. It's a very simple premise, but it's is insanely addicting. Tracks are short and easy to learn, but difficult to master. You need to cut each turn perfectly to win against other people online. You'll be saying to yourself: ""Just 5 more minutes, I'll quit after the next track."" And two hours later you're still playing. Highly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Trackmania 2 doesn't offer a pushed calling mode, sensible tracks and stupefying gathering of available autos like other hustling titles. It has single-player substance, however Nadeo's continuation isn't wanted to be played alone. This is an establishment about sharing, about social event, and about dashing all through of this world circles in the wake of taking a snappy skip off an avenue lifted over a gap floor. It runs with a social occasion of force tracks, yet the certifiable delight of the redirection is picking through the get-together's appearances and ricocheting into servers to go up against others for smart times. Certainly, even so not long after dispatch, there's as of now a critical designate of substance there. On the off chance that you basically need to play alone, there are still a couple of things you can do. The included tracks have benchmarks worked in for you to go up against for changes, and if you're not a power racer the substance will set aside a long chance to open. Regardless of getting to the end of a parcel of the Black-level tracks can be a massive test, additionally fuming through at satisfactorily high speeds to get improvements. While the substance can enthusiasm to race through, the experience can feel genuinely devastate with just phantom vehicles to keep running with you. Thankfully there's a choice to stack in the soul autos of the replays of different players in case you're connected on the web, which drives a supposition rivalry moreover tip you off to better lines around the tracks. Playing on the web can be generally more fun, regardless, in light of the way that you can meanwhile fight and speak with others as you advance through the server's guide turn. Diverse techniques for play are open, however Time Attack is the one being played by far a vast parcel of those on the web. In it all players race over a length of track to post the best time. There's a general time control until the guide switches, and inside that breaking point you can restart as a significant part of the time as you need to record a middle of the road time and help your general arranging. You can see the autos of others as they race however there's no crash, which means you're set up to try the best line to the get done with paying little notice to what number of different players are pressed onto the track. Online preoccupations run an assortment of custom interfaces that show data like near to records, the present tune playing, the track name and client that made it, moreover live rankings as everybody sprints totally, which give a superior than normal layout as you speed along. The track changes for a couple of servers beginning now combine just client made tracks, which can continue running from truly standard, clear associations where the crucial test is to turn as valuably as could be allowed to more extraordinary game plans where you'll hit different speed cushions and go taking off through the air for extended time ranges. In multiplayer stimulations you're given a lot of unexpected beguilement as people around you pound into bars, miss the mark as for gigantic hops and crunch nose first into dividers, or flip end-over-end around sharp turns and off the sides of circles and slants. You'll keep running into relative pitfalls, the effect of which is showed up by the point by point hurt appearing on the autos. Replaying tracks for better times can in actuality change into a fixation in light of the way that most tracks take between 30 seconds to barely a moment to finish, so it never appears like one more lap will be a lot of a period obligation until it's four hours a short time later and you understand you neglect to eat. This is an arcade style racer, so it's unquestionably not hard to get and rapidly show signs of improvement than normal handle on how everything limits whether you're utilizing console or gamepad controls. Controls are clear, simply invigorate, brake and turn, yet there's essentialness to the managing as you comprehend how to utilize the skimming mechanics chronically major for getting a handle on tight changes without beating into a divider or losing a wealth of speed to braking. It's no essential accomplishment paying little regard to the principal controls, as keeping your auto level with the ground over the bangs, bounced and flawed turns of different tracks can be a shaky business. Without enough speed or certainly the right edge it's amazingly simple to end up moving over the gulch floor, however since such an unavoidable danger of dissatisfaction exists it's especially fulfilling when all goes right. Notwithstanding the way that each auto is in every practical sense obscure in Trackmania 2, you can skip into the auto head to re-attempt your paint occupation and create on a track. The unassuming bunch of included formats are all bolster enough, yet in the event that you require something without goliath Ubisoft logos on top of it you may need to contribute the imperativeness to make your own. You can then name and additional the auto and bring it into online rivalries so others can consider about your elegant limit or scorn both your auto's system and you're completing times. The moved track distribution director is astonishingly more strong, permitting you to shape as crazy a track as you wish with a degree of included building pieces. By burrowing through the toybox of grades, passages, S-turns and gorge pieces you can manage some truly imperative courses, an indistinct number of clients from of now have. These appearances are then shared between those in the Trackmania 2 accumulate. It makes a few additional strolls in the event that you need to pick particular tracks, yet it's a key matter of downloading records and setting them in the fitting records. You can then give them a shot yourself in a LAN beguilement, split-screen or in outrageous position modes, or disregard the entire creation point of view completely and simply welcome the get-together conveyed content interweaved into the track insurrections on your most treasured server. It absolutely doesn't hurt that Trackmania 2 looks phenomenal. The lighting impacts and appearance in your auto's reflexive surface are particularly phenomenal, and however the detail on the track pieces isn't decisively on near level, it barely matters as you zoom at high speeds through turns and over hops. To some degree more blend inside seeing the tracks would have been regarded, however the get-together is beginning now working consistently making exchange looks. What truly matters is Trackmania 2 goes on an empowering opinion speed, which adds generally more imperativeness to the experience. Nadeo's Trackmania strategy has dependably been about mixing arcade-style hustling with insane track design, and Trackmania 2 is the same. It empowers an over the top mission for the ideal dashing line however dazzling tracks. You can have a stunning time doing combating to be the speediest in a server or basically welcome the stimulate of taking off at fast crosswise over yawning split and tearing through circles. It's a redirection about social affair and sharing and Nadeo benefits a control of wrapping up the entire of the Trackmania encounter – neighborhood multiplayer, online rivalry, track and auto editors and general rankings – into one bundle. The failure felt through emphasized disappointments examining the crazy turns and touches of Trackmania's courses may put off a couple, yet without the risk of disappointment there could be no conclusion achievement. When you finally run a perfect line through a track to post a record time, every busted fender and yelp of anger is forgotten in a rush of sublime satisfaction.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time.

												Well what can I say? Trackmania is one of my favourite game series. It's a series that basically says ""Screw conventional arcade racing and your Need for Speed knock-off crap, we're doing our own thing."" And so they did. The gameplay is crazy, the difficulty tests your perserverence, the modes are fun, track-building is like a childhood dream come true, and it's very addictive. And this has been the same since the early days of Trackmania (2003) and progressively gotten better. So kudos to Ubisoft to holding onto what Nadeo set out to do in Trackmania 2. I'd definitely recommend everyone to give this underrated game a shot.			",39,1,6,3,2,0,2

												Canyon is most fun of all Trackmania 2 games. It is well designed, nicely balanced in singleplayer, and drifting here is like a dance. The game itself is intense, challenging and it requires a lot of tries on each map to reach higher position in local or global ratings. And that's very important. Competition feeling is one of the most powerful in Trackmania. All that matters - is your skill, and not how well you can kick opponents from the track.I really enjoyed it despite the fact, that there are 3 different games now instead of one: TM2: Canyon, Stadium and Valley.And I strongly recomment this one, it's very different from canyon parts from the first game.

												This is a fun arcade racer with odd physics settings(including being unable to touch other cars. Easy to play hard to master. Most of the gameplay would come from racing on other peoples custom tracks or attempting to get times on the leaderboard in solo. The big seller behind trackmania is its map editor that has a lot of preset peices you will assemble together. The odd physics allow you to create crazy tracks, anywhere on the board for having fun or to have something challenging to beat. The game can also be very competitive with a leaderboard that can be viewed at local and international levels(You pick your location when you create your account and you will be a part of a set of regional to international leaderboards). The most fun i have is competing for the solo international records who get to have their posted to that track.What I liked:Compete Against Anyones Records- For every single track everyones best score is saved to the leaderboard along with a replay. You can select any of the records from the top players to your friends and add the vehicle to track to race against. All of the records you select will appear as ghost cars that align with your actions(reseting will reset them as well). You can use the top players ghosts to learn their strategies for the tracks and have a crap load of opposition to choose from.Solo Mode- The tracks are Divided into difficulties(represented as colours) from super easy to super difficult(and trust me when i say difficult it becomes extremely hard to even get close the the finish line). The difficulties are great for easing you into the easy driving to the crazy ♥♥♥♥ you will end up doing as the tracks slowly introduce harder and harder combinations of the track peices.Track/Map Editor- Very easy to use. All peices have interfaces that tell you what can connect to what. A large number of peices to choose from. The peices are now much more ""realistic"" in design and appearance/ They look much more natural. Once you start thinking outside the box in your design you will come to realize that actually connecting peices is not even necassary. Then you will start to make crazy courses.Physics/Driving- Like in the past for the trackmania series. Each of the themes use different settings of physics and cars that perform quite differently. The same applies here so your going to need to learn the unique physics. Simply driving is very simple however you will find the the courses you will end up driving suddenly the driving becomes difficult to master.Multiplayer- Generally the race types are time trails and regular racing. Time trials give you as set amount of time/laps to get a good time. You can reset yourself/return to last checkpoint at will. What the others are doing is irrelevant however you can still what they are doing. The regular racing is either a point to point format or an actual circuit. In these races you cannot reset your time. You can still return to the last checkpoint or the start, but your time is not reset. The order the playing cross the finish line is the final score. The matches will be ranked(solo tracks with hard rules and full leaderboard support)Low System Requirements/Graphics/Performance- The graphics are not really great or anything special. They are an improvement from the older track mania themes. Max graphics is laughable for a gtx1070 and when you drop them down many lower end machines can get playable performance. My laptop with a gt740 works perfectly well on descent settings. Game is well optimized as a whole as I haven't come across any issues relating to it.Perfect Balancing- Like the rest of trackmania everyones car is the exact same performance wise. You can only customize is paint scheme. If your not lagging everyone is perfectly balanced when it comes to the game itself. The gameplay consists of experience and skill.Unified Launcher- When you have multiple trackmania2 titles they are all accesible without closing the game you originally started.What I disliked:The is nothing in specific that really bothered me about this game, but just to clarify it is an arcade style game not a simulator in any way. There are no ways to modify the body or performance of the car. So if your into the serious racers this game might not interest you.Final Summary:I would recommend this game to anyone who races casually or wants a challenge. If you need to be able to change setting for the vehicle this game is not for you.			",144,10,13,11,31,0,53

												This game is the undisputed champion of time attack! The multiplayer integration is just so immensely huge. Servers have dozens of players on, theres a gazillion of maps, models and skins made by the community. The tracks in each environment are absolutely insane, but still the whole mechanics are so tight that u can tell each 1/1000th of a second that u lost or won during a turn. Trackmania always was a huge hit back in the days and the new installments absolutely lived up to my very high expectations....i sank tons of hours into the previous games. My thumbs were constantly numb and sometimes i shred one gamepad per month, maybe even more. It's just that good.Going for medals and challenging other players records is extremely rewarding. It's not an easy racer, the track layouts are very tight but the physics of the cars are absolutely tight and theres no surprise loss of traction and the like.If u want to check out the cool factor of Trackmania go to TM-Tube.com and check out some of the users videos...some of the stuff is just insane (in style, driving and trackbuilding alike.)11/10 its just sublime and awesome!!!!+edit:Since i read some negative comments about being only 1 car in the game. Theres a trackmania carpark online with hundreds of cars to download (also on the steam workshop) ...some car makers ask for some of the ingame credits...but most of them are download and play.Of course those car models only change the appearance and sound of your car..the handling and speed stay as the reference model to maintain game balance.

												Track mania hasn't always been on steam so I have many more hours than displayed. As far as arcade racing goes, the Track mania series from Mania Planet is very fun. Jumps, wall rides, loops, drifting, high speeds, no complaints, I can use a keyboard to race but prefer a controller for the joystick's sensitivity etc. Both the single player and multiplayer modes are very fun. Like other games, there can be less or more players online during certain times of day. The mutliplayer community is definitely active however. There are plenty of offline maps for single player with varying difficulties to complete for medals. The single player maps in order also can help develop skill. Playing online, the maps can be endless since new maps are continually introduced and cycled. Maps can vary a great deal, from simple to very technical (fractions of seconds count) but very fun. Ranking is tracked and displayed for single and multiplayer, locally and globally.It also has a level editor to create your own maps.I use the steam workshop for car skins and downloadable maps, a lot of decent content.http://maniaplanet.wikia.com/wiki/TrackMania_(series) ",150,11,6,7,6,1,3

												Trackmania 2 is an interesting game. It gives alot ""room"" for the player to customize the game to their heart's content. However, it's not that user friendly. But, after playing around with the features, and getting some good advise from some friends, I figured out how to customize it. The trailer shows them in a gran prix fashion. There's two ways you can do that. 1. Record many ghosts in the replay editor, or 2. rounds mode. I conclude that this game is one's who want a challenge.P.S. Levels A through B will be a breeze, then it's the hard stuff			",7,3,18,0,5,0,0

												Trackmania Canyon is more than your average arcade racer. If you're looking for the Quake of racing games, this is it.It's real time leaderboard incorperation into multiplayer servers serves not only as a visual clarification of your improvements over time, but an insentive to keep playing, and claim those tops spots. The UI is plain, simple and to the point, as well as being easy on the eye.The game boasts a singleplayer series of tracks that range in difficulty, with end-game content being hard to unlock, and extremely difficult without many hours of practise. You can do 'offical' runs every 5 minutes when practicing, which will upon completion upload your time to a leaderboard with the change to get SP or skill points, however internet connection is not manditory to play these.The game has a very long learning curve, with the player having to develop their muscle memory with the car physics, learning tricks that help the top players shave off those milliseconds. There a lot of flicking involved, that's for sure.The physics in the game feel wonderful, and have a very dynamic, full feeling; giving you a sense of complete control over your car. Something that many racing games fail to capture to this day. Combine that with a plethora of user created tracks - from technical ESL-styled and Speedtech courses to LOL and Mr DVD minis, each track potentially introducing a new way to take certain turns, making new tips and tricks to learn for every possible transistion, turn, jump; you name it.Another great plus to mention is the community with the vast majority of players being friendly, and willing to give you tips on how to improve your driving. A small percentage of the playerbase of the populous trolls, but that's to be expected for any online community, niche or not.If you're looking for something to get into that'll take you a while to learn, whilst having fun getting there, then this game is for you. Play for a month then look back on your first replays and you'll really see the improvement which is another great positive about the game as your progress really does show.The only downside about the game  would be the lack of a search option. Finding specific maps or replays is difficult when you've amassed a large library of either is difficult and time consuming.			",96,3,7,2,7,1,6

												I wish there was an alternative to the Steam's recommended Yes/No rating system. This game isn't bad, but it definitely isn't for everyone (then again, what game is?). NOTE: There are spoilers in this review. If you care about spoilers and have not played the game yet, I highly suggest you do so before reading this review. THE REVIEW: + Open world with lots to explore (see video).+ Compatible with gamepad - a must for any racing game.+ Better car mechanics than Final Fantasy XV.+/- The story isn't bad, but isn't good eather. Something in between.+/- No save checkpoints, so you culd continue where you left off the previous day.- No Uplay- The trees and ground textures are often lower quality than the car (see video).- At times railed and repetative driving (how other people play the game).- Other cars (AI) are not clipped, so it feels like racing a ghost.- No easy setting, thus NOT for the casual gamer like me.- The ending sucks.If you are considdering buying this game, then the first thing you should do is see a good gameplay video. Here's one covering all important aspects of gameplay thoroughly:

												Here is THE best multiplayer racing game ever made.TrackMania is the game created by the community, the maps, the cars, the roads, the environment, all is made by the players for the players and that's the best point of the game.This is what makes this game different from the others, the players will change the game to enhance the techniques of driving for the competitions to be as impressive as possible. That's why TrackMania Stadium is one of the games listed in the Electronic Sports World Cup.And even though It's been 10 years since the first TrackMania got released, the game is quite empty but you will always find a server to play. However, the main problem of an empty game is that the maps don't change (in some servers), some people already played the maps around a thousand times when the game is about creating and sharing maps.If you never, ever played TrackMania, prepare hours of lessons of driving because this one is ""the new generation of driving"", you are a soap in the canyon, use water to make lather and then slide. The first time is always the hardest, but always the best. If I didn't like this game, I wouldn't had ever spent almost 3k hours of my lifetime playing any TrackMania since 2006.The price is worth it. Try it.			",269,51,20,20,7,3,6

												The original TrackMania games were damned amazing and had a great following with tons of servers full of thousands of players at any given time of day. For the last ten months, the new TrackMania games have been dead. I paid full price for all three titles, expecting to have an even better time with the new games, because why not?Well, as the days turned to weeks, I realized the folly of my wasted money as almost all of the servers remained dead across the planet and it continued to be impossible to find a choice of heavily populated servers. Whether it was the dumb choice to milk the players of their cash by splitting the game up into three separate releases (one for each environment) and requiring separate servers for each or if it was the decision to charge money for the new games, at all, the result remains the same -- nobody plays these.If you reference SteamCharts[steamcharts.com] for Canyon, you'll find that the average number of players at any given time through all of 2013 was between 10 and 100. Across the entire planet - and most usually seem to be overseas (Germany, France, Russia, Spain, the UK), so if you're looking for a populated low-ping server in your region and you're in North America, you're going to have a bad time.It's a very unfortunate situation. The game looks better than ever and it has a lot of enjoyment to offer if you like this style of game. It's a fantastic time waster when you need a break here and there. However, you ultimately need a player-base for a multi-player game to be enjoyed. Their business and release model for this series of games completely failed in this way, this time around.Here's to hoping they give the franchise another shot in a couple more years and they correct their mistakes.

												Trackmania Stadium was basically perfect. The real magic was in the nuance of control -- the ability to slightly alter your vehicle's rotation in the air by strategically tapping the brakes. Canyon throws that out the window and becomes a significantly more frustrating game for it. With the game's tendency to present you with massive jumps and ramps, you often have to leave it up to random chance whether or not you'll land correctly. The level of precision it demands from the driver borderlines on impossible sometimes. It's still a good game, it's just significantly more difficult and more frustrating than Trackmania Stadium.

Multiplayer works perfectly and I always find games where is atleast 30 players.

You can do very basic maps or really hardcore maps, depends what you want :)..

												From my perspective, I found this game to be very enjoyable. + Exceptional Graphics+ Visible Damage without affecting handling+ Multiplayer: See others w/o crashing into 'em+ Mods available (I drive mainly a 911 or sometimes Sonic The Hedgehog)- Not as many players as free version of TrackMania - Lots of servers but player #'s stay around 30, on a good day- Bought game during a sale. Thought full price was too much.- While Single Player is straight forward, Mutiplayer has slight learning curveI got this game because I have a love for racing games in general. It's such a simple yet effective game. What makes me keep coming back is the multiplayer. Trust me when I say that there are some seriously crazy challenging tracks out there in mutiplayer mode and when the time runs out with you finishing in the top 3 or even top 10, I find it to be really rewarding.If this is your kind of game, then you should buy it.

												There is only one goal in this game, win. Its a simple goal, but be wary of other players trying to take your gold medal from you. Distract them by telling them funny stories in chat once you have the fastest time. There is no friends in racing other than pit crew. Everyone is an  enemy. The best FFA game.

												It's the dullest of the three ""Trackmania 2"" packages, and the blocks/environment are a bit less inspired than the other two, but that doesn't mean this is a bad game.If you're a fan of the TM universe buy it! You won't be disapointed (if you are a fan i definetly recommend getting all the three packages).If you can only buy 2 of the three packages i suggest getting this and Valley, but if you can only get one i suggest ""Valley"".As standard from Nadeo, the game is perfect, and once again the track editor is the best one we could hope for.Amazing graphics, smooth gameplay, hard (as it should be), magnificent editor, vibrant community.A seriously recommended game.

												The Trackmania series is pretty much a league of its own.  The various games in this series (Canyon, Stadium, Valley*) are quite similar in structure yet still have their own gameplay.  Canyon, like all other Trackmania games, have simple, highly-responsive controls.  You do not need a steering wheel or PC controller to enjoy this!  Despite the simplicity of the controls, the feel of the game is much deeper.  Powersliding around corners and launching off of ramps seem easy at first, but you'll have to think twice about your performance when another user beats your time by 1/100th of a second.  The precision needed to beat other (human) player will make you drop your jaw --only to have it slam shut after choking on their dust.To add onto the play style game feels like it is trying to straddle hardcore precision as well as arcade (think Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit (2010), and it does a fantastic job at this.  Despite how frustrating it might be for trying to top the leaderboards, the game also has a little bit of a comical side; it can get very amusing playing on a server with 100+ other people and seeing many of them fall behind as you cruise on through.  ...  What?  100+ on a single server?  It is easier than you think!Within all gamemodes, even circuit, there is no worry of server lag because times are handled more on every computer individually and there is no running into each other at all, everyone can play at their own pace --heck, you don't even have to run the race to have fun if you choose to go running off the track for your own adventure.  As for playing against other people, the leaderboards are the best I've ever seen.  You can see where you rank amongst other people globally, your country, and even down to your state/province/region.  Plus, there are individual rankings for single-player and multiplayer as well.Hey, guess what?  I only told you what got me hooked on this game.  There is still more to Trackmania than what I have mentioned here!*Valley has not yet been released, even for open beta, at the time of this Recommendation.			",625,276,25,56,60,7,73

												Easy to pick up and impossible to master. Cars are fast and stunts are big, and this of the other two environments stands out the most. Awesome online community, very friendly. Although this game could seem repetitive, it's presented I a way that makes it nowhere near repetitive. It may be the same cars with the same type of track types, but every individual track finds a way to make itself unique in its own way.The track editor has always been major I track mania games and this version of it is by far my favourite and the best of all of them. With the introduction of these new macroblocks, the possibilities for track creation are limitless. The editor doesn't require any experience, as the simplistic design makes it very user friendly.Graphics are incredible for a game of its time, and I may go as far as saying they are amazing still to this day. 10/10, incredible.

												Great addition to the Trackmania name. Switching from Nations to this, they've added a good deal to the physics: Drifting feels controlled, as opposed to driving on ice. Dirt feels like dirt, now, and the effects of it are apparent enough to strategically account for.The singleplayer is more varied, it seems, and serves as an excellent training ground for the new techniques presented in Canyon. But the heart of the game is in the multiplayer, which includes things I haven't seen in other Trackmanias. It feels like the map-makers of Canyon are more devoted, and more creative, in a lot of cases.If you are new to the series, then Stadium might be a more preferred starting point, but Canyon definitely feels more satisfying. Check it out.			",368,93,7,27,21,3,22

												Stadium is better IMO because it has more population, more community generated content, and more persistent playerbase than this game.Racing gameplay here is largely based on drifting.  Note that car acceleration is very high, but handling and grip is poor; you literally glide across the road like wet soap on ceramic.This was the first of the TM2 series, and its also the least polished.  Other games fully exploit the features and such that Trackmania 2 has available.Note that environments are canyons, dirt roads, and sand.  That's it.  There isn't much concrete or manmade aesthetic blocks you can use to create custom, beautiful environments.  As such, its a bit harder to create custom maps for this game.However, this game is beautiful and its fun to play.  It comes 3rd in my recommendations of the Trackmania 2 franchise.

												TrackMania used to be a really fun game.  There are some fun tracks, but later on they get very frustrating and you have to be exact and with the controls so sensitive, it's just no longer fun.  I guess you can make your own tracks but I just dont have the time for that.  Oh well I tried it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The trailer for TM2: Canyon is somewhat misleading. The video shows dozens of cars in intense races through crazy environments. That can happen, but the online community hasn't taken off with this release. What you will experience is an absolutely consistent skill-oriented precision racing game. You will have to drive and drift as perfectly as possible through tracks that can have huge jumps, wallrides, and loops.Fortunately, the vehicle handling is brilliant. Drifting in Trackmania 2: Canyon is probably the best in any racing game I have played, and you still have the ability to maintain precise control during that drift. This is a game about mastery of a track, where every millisecond matters and mistakes mean restarting the race. Highly recommended.			",255,40,10,24,14,4,29

												Aside from the absolute scam of selling us environments one at a time instead of the three pack format of the past games (stadium was originally free to play hence it's stand alone debut) the game is littered with technical problems. Chief being that the promised ability to swap between Canyon, Stadium and Valley at will doesn't actually work right now. It can be somewhat fixed by using the maniaplanet client instead of steam but it is still clunky at best and means a majority of servers will only use a single map type. This is utterly pathetic considering Trackmania united had seven environments all merged together. Visually the game looks a lot better on the Trackmania 2 engine, there’s a load more effects and post processing. The game even has a superficial damage model now which is a nice novelty. Requirements are still fairly low although it has had a definite impact for the lowest end machines so beware if you’re accustomed to playing United on a toaster.The editor this time has a far smaller selection of blocks than past games and this limits track design to a large degree, this has been mostly addressed now but for a long time it was perhaps the worst part of the game, disastrous when trackmania is sold on the concept of players making all the content.Nowadays the problem is the community, the high price tags for individual environments coupled with technical problems from Steam demanding a restart to swap between them leads to a massively fragmented community. Simply put nobody is ever playing, even at peak times it’s rare to find more than a few hundred people playing the game compared to the thousands that United had even without the F2P users.You may at first think this isn’t much of an issue, Trackmania is after all about time trials there is no collision between other cars and there is even a toggle to render players if you find them distracting. So playing on an empty server isn’t as impact as it is on other games. HOWEVER remember that Trackmania has always been about player created maps, they quite literally make for almost all of the content in this game. Fewer people playing means fewer people making maps and less content for everyone involved. Most of the great map makers from united and earlier have simply elected to stay in United if not outright left the series. Overall I simply cannot recommend this game, I want to like it but there are just too many flaws and almost all of them stem from Ubisoft’s utterly insane business model for the latest three instalments in the series. If you are new to the Trackmania games stick with United it simply has more of everything.			",123,12,7,15,6,1,13

Why should you care about my review?I am a father of two boys, ages 3 and 6 and hold a BA in Game Design (although I work as a database admin - tough to leave a job of 15 years to pursue the ""dream"" of game design with a family to support.) That aside, we use a HTPC with Steam in Big picture Mode launched from XBMC. With a wife and two young ones, everything has to be remote and controller friendly. The games also have to be kid-friendly. If you find yourself in a similar situation and trust the opinion of a trained game designer (but not professionally working at it) - then read on.edit: since I bought the Trackmania three game pack, I am posting the same review in the other two titles as the pros and cons are the same for all (except for Valley, which has a Con unique to itself.)Pros-- The game was cheap. $20 for three games (Stadium, Canyon, and Valley) during the Steam winter sale made this something worth trying out.-- Despite not having an ESRB rating (that I could find anyway), the games are kid friendly. Physics are loose, no bodies are flying out of cars, you can restart at a spawn point on the track, facing the right way (important for the three year old!) at any time you get stuck. I can start a split-screen game and choose a ""playlist"" for the kids to race at the same time. They're happy, I'm happy.-- The game is fun. Stunts, fast cars, loose physics, respawns, tricky tracks, loop tracks, various difficulties, time trials, medals, rankings. And I haven't even tried actual online multi-player yet. I'm not too interested in that part so I won't review that part of the game at this time.-- Game runs smooth. I've experienced no crashes (the game software, not cars!), no jerkiness, graphics are decent, controls on a 360 controller are easy enough for the three year old to win races against his big brother occasionally.Cons-- The interface is severely lacking. Poor design choices abound. To launch the games, Steam launches another launcher (ManiaPlanet). In this new launcher, you see all three games you purchased (after you installed them all). However, if I click on ""Stadium"" from Steam, then decide to play ""Canyon"" in the ManiaPlanet (MP) launcher, it says I have to restart the game I want from Steam. What's the point of this extra layer of launcher then? Stupid design.-- The MP launcher is not controller friendly. This means I have to get the keyboard out just to be able to arrow down to the ""Start Game"" button. You can't hit it with ANY button on a controller. Once that's done, you can use the controller in game, but not in this MP launcher.-- Selecting items using the controller is poor design. Blue text turns a bit ""more blue"" or slightly brighter. Arrows that are white turn slightly brighter when selected. The wife and kids can't tell what the heck they're navigating. I know about this and I can barely see this on a 42"" screen. It's clear the interface is designed only for mouse. The controller does work, but it's not easy to see the navigation. This means I have to setup the game for the kids. I have to get them into the tracks, I have to change playlists (or games if they want to play Stadium for instance.)-- Kids can't get their own profile. I tried setting the game to use ""multiple profiles"" but the feature is nigh-useless. I attempted to create a profile for my eldest so he can have his own rankings or even just his own car model when playing split-screen. I didn't want him to access online so I created a local profile. Now none of the games launch. They say ""You must connect online to launch the game."" I did say LOCAL account didn't I? Again, stupid. So I tried to create a new profile using my already created online account (cause I couldn't get the games to run even by myself before doing this.) The game wouldn't let me do that. Only one key per account it says. I tried creating a new account to the same effect. They want you to buy the game again just so you can use multiple profiles. So to recap, you can't create a local profile without connecting it to an onlne account and you can't create multiple users under one account and you can't create multiple online accounts without buying additional licenses. Stupid.-- Due to the above, the simple feature in almost any racing game, choosing a car skin, can't be done except by the online profile. So my kids playing in split screen have to settle for the plain gray cars and my eldest can't keep his own records and scores.-- Car engine sounds disappear when you select High quality Audio (you have to keep it at normal).-- Some of the tracks are way too difficult for really little ones (not a knock on the game, just something to be aware of.)-- Controls are not consistent between solo play and multiplayer. For example, the respawn button by default is the yellow Y button in solo play. In split screen, you push down (click the button) on the left analog stick. I'd like to remap it as the respawn button on the steering control leads to accidental respawns However, it doesn't seem to ""take"" as it looks like it's tied to profiles, which as mentioned above, I can't create.-- the in-game HUD is awful. Everything is so small it's pointless on a big screen from across the room. Thankfully the kids don't care about this info, they just want to race. Worth noting.ConclusionThere is just too much stupidity in design to overcome for me. So if you find yourself with a media center that also serves as a game machine for the kids and are looking for a fun racing game the little ones can enjoy. I'd consider this title at rock-bottom prices otherwise I'm recommending you go elsewhere. You simply can't do simple things other racing games can, nothing is intuitive, the interface is awful (both menu and during racing). Despite that, once you get a race going, it is fun for the kids. So the core gameplay is ok, it's all the design elements, the spit and polish that surround the game that is severely lacking good design. If you want fun big-screen family room entertainment, local split screen multi-player, racing game - go get Sonic Transformed.If you read this far and are just looking for a single-player or online, match-making, stunt racing, beat the clock game - why did you read my review? Didn't I write at the start this wasn't the perspective? Go check out other reviews that are more your demographic. Since you're still here, all the flaws mentioned above still irk me as a designer, so I'd look for a more realistic racing game than this one if it weren't for my kids and split screen wasn't a factor.Get it on sale, avoid it otherwise.

Now that I attempt to intall it on a new computer, I am told that the cd key has already been used. I am on the exact same steam and Trackmania account, but I somehow don't own the game anymore? I can still technically play the game, but since I ""do not own it"" I cannot play multiplayer, use workshop mods (half the fun), or play more than an hour a day.I then attempted to ask for help on the steam discussions but all i got was responses from a developer telling me that I should be using the same account, can't log in, or should just ignore the ""cd key has already been used"" message.TL;DR: I can't play this game anymore because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DRM, and the developer is telling me to ignore it.

												This is a hardcore racing game. By hardcore I mean unforgiving and performance focused. It can be exhilarating once you get in the flow, although the tracks are often too obfuscated for that (made worse by the absence of any minimap and their extreme narrowness). The biggest problem about this game though isn't the game itself but the interface and the ManiaPlanet client which are horrendous. When buying I naively expected to find easy in-client map browsing (which was the reason for my uninformed impulse purchase) but it's sad to see nothing has evolved since the early TM days and browsing and downloading and playing user-made tracks is still a pain in the ♥♥♥. Another non-game related gripe is about the stupid ""1 Mania Planet account per key"" system which means you basically lose your game if you lose your Mania Planet IDs. The menu navigation is pretty bad too.So overall the game in itself is very challenging and fun, but everything around it sucks. My rating is to balance out the positive reviews because I would still recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I misfired 5 bucks during a sale for this game.This game may not be for everyone, but if you are looking for an arcade racing game (there are not physics like in serious racing games), with one only mode of play (solo time-trials in short crazy tracks), this is your game. Somewhere they say it's a multiplayer game, but what you actually can do is to compare your timing with others worldwide and download those ghost times.I prefer games like DiRT, F1, Forza, etc., where you actually race in realistic tracks and cars, not only for time, but for position and championship points as well.

												Gamers may like it, I may be in the minority, but the tracks aren't fun. I don't like the fact you drive 'blind' on many tracks with no way of knowing where you're supposed to go, and there's better racing games out there.If you like memorizing patterns and having to restart races from scratch several times, this may be for you, but its not my cup of tea.At least I purchased it on a sale an didn't pay full price.

												Hvis du tænker på at købe dette spil eller nogen af de andre så lad vær!Det er lavet som om det er et rigtigt racer spil.Men gassen-bremsen og styringen minder om noget der er set i Mario Kart fra N64 eller Super Nintendo, så det er ikke noget jeg kan anbefale nogen at opleveps. Man kan heller ikke købe / få flere biler eller sætte sin bil op på nogen måde..så i forhold til grid vinder dette klart"" men igen i forholf til Shift2 vinder det spil klart over alle andre racer spil (som jeg har spillet) inklusiv alle GT spil til PS2-3Note: Hehe sjovt nok ligner det et spil som Hot Wheels men det kan man ikke rigtigt sige det er (tror ingen gang billedet de viser er noget fra spillet af) måske concept art man det er da også max!

												Trackmania Canyon is one of those ""Legendary"" games, as I like to call it. If you get into it (note the IF, this game is not for everybody), you will absolutely love it. It's one of those games where if you get into it, you can easily spend hundreds of hours into it. Main aspect inth this game for me is the competetive one, as in, trying to be the best in my city, country, etc.. and of course the social aspect. Nothing is nicer than being in a server full of friends or clanmates and just beating records, chatting and having a fun time.+1			",185,21,7,11,16,1,19

												I love racing games and also love competition this game is packed the best of both. This title does not try to pretend to be anything but an arcade racer and it does it very very well. I love the Regional, Country and World ranking systems. You download the leaders ghost runs and get to see where the best lines are to cut your times drastically. All the tracks and stunts that can be performed has taken this title from the RC Racing car that it used to be to a front row 5 star racer. I give it a 9.5 out of 10 - Super Great Title			",430,56,40,38,43,2,44

												I've always been a big fan of the TM. For me, TM2: Canyon is the best TM to date, I really cant put my finger on what really gets me about this particular title, maybe its the pace, the speed or just plain thrills of doing loops at 500 miles an hour.If you're into racing games then you HAVE to try this out. It's a completely new dimension of racing. All in all, I'll give it a hefty 9.5/10 and the only reason why it didn't got a 10 is because the grid size in the editor isn't adjustable. The height limit of the editor leaves much to be desired.The multiplayer is a bit tough if you're starting out(this game is not easy) the time differences between 1st and 2nd places are exceptionally small. I love how you can make your own custom vinyls and put them in the game and did I mention the ludicrous abundance of texture/car/block/track mods available?This game is essentially a keyboard racer's wet dream.Get it!

												Trackmania Canyon is probably the most satisying game of the TrackMania² lot.  The stadium approach of endless boring technical fullspeed maps where all speed gains come from just holding down one button or key for the entire map while sticking to a single ideal race line, both the stock and popular genres of custom made maps in Canyon demand precision drifting through impossibly thin margins at blistering speeds.Nothing comes close to matching the sense of speed and visceral satisfaction this game offers at knocking fractions of a second off of your personal bests.  Or watching your car fly into space after getting intimately familiar with a canyon wall or lamppost.  The time attack format and typical bite sized map length of 30-60 seconds allow for experiences that are challenging without becoming too frustrating, either from the perspective of the new player who's still bouncing off walls or the ladder points nerd trying to get that one perfect run.You should definitely buy this game if you have any interest in going fast.

												Trackmania, a series of racegames, it's definetly underappriciated for what it actually it. Personally is has suprisingly the best handling with the arrow keys in any race games I've played. The tracks are wacky, crazy and never seen in any other race game. Includes a track builder, video editor for making cool movies and even some free DLC to pick up through maniaplanet with new wacky tracks to play.

												Trackmania² Canyon is very different from the old Trackmania Nations. If you expect Canyon to be the same as Nations, You'll be in for quite a surprise. If that is positive or negative, you must decide that for yourself. I recommend watching a video on YouTube before making a purchasing decision. Anyway. I loved the old Trackmania, I absolutely adored it, so what happened when I saw this game for the first time? I was stunned. Amazed. How they've made this so different, but keeping the soul. The realism is fantastic. Reflecting vehicles, amazing envoironments, you name it. That is what Ubisoft did all those years. They've redesigned the driving mechanics completely. For the good, they've made drifting possible. And how! They've transformed a precision racing game, into an art. The drifting is magestic. And at the same time redicoulusly awesome.I definitely recommend this game!			",30,13,14,0,5,1,1

												If you love Trackmania, this one is a MUST HAVE!The physics are better than ever! If you love drifts this is the game for you. As in every Trackmania, there is an infinite amount of tracks, because of the easy editor and the great people that create wonderful maps. Nearly 1000 hours of game time prove my point.

												One of the most online competative racing games availbable for PC. Local and International ranking system is rewarding in all the right ways by encouraging you to race against the world's best and general time spent racing. It offers an outrageously large collection of tracks both pre-made and custom forcing you to both drive well around familar and unfamilar obsticles. Some people may dislike the absence of collision with competitors and lack of car customization options. This game takes pride in itself to be competitive and sacrifices simulation features to get it. Physics collisions are generally hilarious and ""LoL Tracks"" offer a more arcade racing experience.

												I've always been a big fan of the TM. For me, TM2: Canyon is the best TM to date, I really cant put my finger on what really gets me about this particular title, maybe its the pace, the speed or just plain thrills of doing loops at 500 miles an hour.If you're into racing games then you HAVE to try this out. It's a completely new dimension of racing. All in all, I'll give it a hefty 9.5/10 and the only reason why it didn't got a 10 is because the grid size in the editor isn't adjustable. The height limit of the editor leaves much to be desired.The multiplayer is a bit tough if you're starting out(this game is not easy) the time differences between 1st and 2nd places are exceptionally small. I love how you can make your own custom vinyls and put them in the game and did I mention the ludicrous abundance of texture/car/block/track mods available?This game is essentially a keyboard racer's wet dream.Get it!

After trying both stadium and valley, canyon has turned out to be my favourite, it also has the most people playing. Not your typical arcade racing game, just your own skills and the clock, so if thats what you're looking for, definitely get this game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Trackmania² Canyon is very different from the old Trackmania Nations. If you expect Canyon to be the same as Nations, You'll be in for quite a surprise. If that is positive or negative, you must decide that for yourself. I recommend watching a video on YouTube before making a purchasing decision. Anyway. I loved the old Trackmania, I absolutely adored it, so what happened when I saw this game for the first time? I was stunned. Amazed. How they've made this so different, but keeping the soul. The realism is fantastic. Reflecting vehicles, amazing envoironments, you name it. That is what Ubisoft did all those years. They've redesigned the driving mechanics completely. For the good, they've made drifting possible. And how! They've transformed a precision racing game, into an art. The drifting is magestic. And at the same time redicoulusly awesome.I definitely recommend this game!			",30,13,14,0,5,1,1

The height limit of the editor leaves much to be desired.The multiplayer is a bit tough if you're starting out(this game is not easy) the time differences between 1st and 2nd places are exceptionally small. I love how you can make your own custom vinyls and put them in the game and did I mention the ludicrous abundance of texture/car/block/track mods available?This game is essentially a keyboard racer's wet dream.Get it!

												I am a fan of TrackMania games and this one I really enjoyed as well. Even more customizable track editor with the ability to install mods. Cool racing game all around (far from reality) but I find it fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For me the best kind of racing. The car feels fairly realistic compared to the previous TrackMania games. In TrackMania You are able to create Your own tracks with nearly unlimited possibilities and/or You can try out tracks, which other people have made. There are thousands of those tracks, so You'll never get bored of this particular game. I know I won't!			",344,100,23,76,35,2,71

												Great game. Excellent driving mechanics and fun maps make for a unique racing experience, to a point. Very much reminds me of hotwheels in videogame form, very articulate design and well thought out gameplay. Though, some mechanics involving multiplayer and mods not fully flushed out. Overall, 3 out of 5. Fun, and worth the buy. Unique to a selling point, but many racing games these days rival it.			",229,20,3,13,11,2,24

												Very good game, crazy speeds, crazy stunts, good premade tracks, Workshop support, AND a free demo if you want to see if you like it.  Out of the 3 trackmanias tire grip is loose, very drifty. Whitch is not bad, infact it allows to take hard U turns without slowing down as mutch compared to stadium.			",104,6,8,6,9,1,2

												After getting the complete version of TM2 during the Steam Winter Fail 2016 (Most of the discounts weren't my cup of tea), I have one thing to say about this game compared to the only other TM game I have played, TM Sunrise.This game will TEST YOU. It will test you to no end on your precision and how well you can powerslide without sending your car careening into a lampost. One you get it down, you can get that adrenaline rush that the whole of Sonic The Hedgehog wishes it could give you. Getting medals is also a challenge, even with the lower difficulty tracks. I just go for silver medals in single player, because the golds are basically MLG pro (At least they don't quickscope you the moment you get in the lead). The only problem I see with single player is currently, I don't think you can have multiple opponents to race against. Solo is 1v1 the whole way through (As far as I can tell). The physics are still what you'd expect from trackmania: go fast and you'll win, but you might wind up launching yourself off the track at that bump in the road or fly off at the next dip in the road and put yourself into a roll that costs you your silver medal.Complimenting the challenge is the great aesthetics and performance. My computer runs this game at near perfect frames, and the vibrant color palette (DAT SKYBOX BE DOUBLE-D SEXY) makes the game pop.This review is just based on my completion of all the white-flag challenges, so my experience can't say the same other players.In the end, I say that this is a good installment in the Trackmania franchise, and worth my 20 bucks. I recommend you  do what I did, and grab it before the Steam Winter Fail ends, or wait for the next discount on the franchise. Fans won't be disappointed (Maybe).			",40,3,3,10,11,0,3

												This game is fun, but dont expect too much. If u have never played a trackmania game before, you might want to read this. Trackmania players, you already have an idea what it will be like. If you have watched the trailer, it shows cars going around a loop. This is actually super hard to do, because you have to control the car as it goes around. It also switches your view to first person when you go around the loop. The single player is fun, though the multiplayer is better. Would recommend to any racing fan.			",18,1,2,0,1,0,0
