Early Access Review
Basic InformationTitle:  Guts and Glory Status:  Early AccessDeveloper:  HakJak ProductionsPublisher:  tinyBuild	Genre:  3D Chaotic SandboxRelease Date:  16th of February, 2017Type:  Singleplayer General ImpressionGuts and Glory! Now that’s a title that does justice to the game it labels. If Goat Simulator was gaming’s equivalent of an acid trip, well G&G must be compared to wiping VX on your face. Feel free to google that as I have more important things to do now. Such as describing the hilarious chaos that Guts and Glory actually is. I never had so much fun with an Early Access title on Steam before. I’m sure you noticed the weird genre label I gave it. What’s the deal with that? Well just as the trusty ol’ Goat, I Am Bread, Garry’s Mod, Guts and Glory can be fitted into a genre of its own. Yet all that gore and black humor moments, have to be taken into accout too. Thus the “Chaotic Sandbox” term was coined by yours truly.The dev team never released another project prior to G&G and as you can imagine, I’m quite impressed by their Steam debut. Early Access stage or not, you have enough content already in place to justify its price tag for example. How could I not appreciate that, considering that nearly half of the Early Access games I played so far on Steam felt more than just a little overpriced and some were abandoned by their developers eventually? I got a feelin’ Guts and Glory shall teach its label counterparts a lesson or two in those regards. Now let’s discuss the gameplay, shall we? For the life of me, I wish I had a design talent/patience to create digital art or draw something cool. Because you will be making the equivalent of art, in its raw form should you hit that “Create” button from the game’s Main Menu. Yes, you can create your own levels filled with as many obstacles/traps as you like and then share them with the rest of the Steam community via Workshop. Nifty option, but not for an antitalent. So I’ll just stick to the “Play” button and enjoy the official tracks along with whatever eclectic craziness other folks concocted.With no storyline per se and three distinct heroes to choose from, you do need some explanation. From what I could pick up so far, Guts and Glory seems to share that name with the kind of activity that puts Japanese game shows on shameful display. Lame pun, right? Well G&G is filled to the brim with humorous situations which quickly turn lethal, in a not so Happy Tree Friends style, for our hapless protagonists. Let’s see who they are. Not-so model father John and his youngster, Jimmy. They ride a bicycle which I’m sure Jimmy would have preferred to be a mountain bike, fitted with the proper suspension for the places his deranged father shall drag him or more likely, lose him along the way, since that child safety seat seemed very flimsy. Now you’re starting to understand why kids aren’t usually portrayed in certain video games. Next on the list, is everyone’s favorite redneck stereotype: quad bike riding, shotgun-toting, Earl! Sadly he doesn’t have a matching personality or at least a few lines of dialogue/monologue and Billy Bob was probably busy. His quad is an obvious improvement over John’s bike, so if speed is crucial for the stunts, Earl is your man. Just don’t lose the beers he’s carrying or he’ll surely introduce you to his baseball bat.And last but not least, it had to be another stereotype, right? For real, I’m not making this up. The Yang family. As if there weren’t enough films featuring the “Asians can’t drive” trope. Well, you shall control Mr. Yang taking his wife and daughter on a road trip to a theme park. They drive a nice convertible which ironically, despire being the heaviest vehicle in the game, features the funniest (or grizzliest) stunts. The car seems to have been sabotaged or something and you can fill in the rest and the exact outcome of attempting to drift at every turn with next to no brakes.With such an (un)likable cast of characters, what could go wrong? Well a lot, apparently. Traps which range from silly to serious and most of them deadly upon impact. Spinning circular blades, arrows, land mines, cannon balls and even good ol’ gravity at times. Nothing spells ""family trip fun"" more than driving full speed off a cliff and straight into the woods at night. We’re lucky Guts and Glory thought of everything. I won’t spoil more, you’ll get the hang of this game in  no time. What was basically a boring checkpoint and stunt game on paper, it is in fact a prime example of dark humor when rendered in motion. I already tackled the princing concerns, along with the content present so far as opposed to the insanely promising stuff the dev team wishes to implement in future updates. Purchase it now and you won’t regret it, if it’s 3D chaos you’re after. I do hope that with subsequent updates, both Achievements and Cards will be included in this already tempting package. Just don’t forget to leave the trap-filled stunts for video game characters and drive responsibly in real life. Also avoid land mines. Those encounters never end well.Strong Points+ Pleasant graphics and physics display.+ Hilarious gameplay filled with dark humor.+ Decently priced Early Access.+ User-created levels available in the Steam Workshop.Weak Points- Lots of content is still work-in-progress.- Still a few bugs and unintended glitches here and there.- No Steam Trading Cards nor Achievements.Rating 90/100  This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews, through the generous contribution of RedHill.

Early Access Review
Note: As a comedy game, Guts and Glory attracts a lot of non-serious/meme/troll reviews. These (unfortunately) highly popular so-called reviews do not help people who are considering to purchase this game. Feel free to read mine if you're looking for a serious, informative review that helps you get an in-depth look on the game's worth.IntroductionGuts and Glory is a gore comedy,  ragdoll physics, level-based-obstacle-racing indie game made by HakJak Productions. The gameplay in general is obviously inspired by the legendary web browser-based platform gore comedy game: Happy Wheels. In case you are not familiar with Happy Wheels' gameplay, it is basically a race to the finish line using various kinds of vehicles, with a twist. The 'race track' is usually entirely covered with traps, turrets, mines, and other ridiculous obstacles that will cut (or blow) your character to pieces. Happy Wheels itself thrived through community-made maps that allows map creators to challenge other players to finish their track - Guts and Glory also supports this feature.A heads up for sensitive people: The core entertainment of the game is dark humor. Don't be shocked when a child character got mutilated by flying saws, flattened by cannonballs, or crushed by massive logs. Avoid this game if you will be offended or made uncomfortable by these kinds of jokes.Pros+ Players can create their own maps through Steam Workshop+ Both funny and challenging at the same time. Guts and Glory makes failing a level a hilarious experience.+ I read somewhere that the devs produced their own soundtrack. This is definitely worth mentioning since the soundtrack is quite enjoyable.+ Unlike a lot of other early access games, you can play all that the game has to offer without any issues+ Different vehicles offer different features and controls, offering extra gameplay variance e.g. Nitrous on cars and backflip/front flip on bikes+ Funny, outrageous scenario for each level e.g. 'visiting' your neighbors by smashing through their houses with an ATV+ Track challenges varies - not everything is about dodging arrows and cannonballsCons- Clunky, unresponsive control. Probably made this way on purpose to support the comedy/meme aspect but I don't find it enjoyable- Map creators might find it tedious having to upload their maps to Steam Workshop instead of being instantly accessible in-game. Compared to Happy Wheels, Guts and Glory's user-generated content receives much less attention. I assume this issue is caused either by lack of Steam users' interest to look around the Community (i.e. Library - Play - Quit kind of guy) or the difficulty of creating their own map compared to Happy Wheel's simplistic Flash Player platform design. - Levels that are too difficult to finish can lock players from progressing further & enjoy variation. Although this is purely subjective, a 'Skip Level' option would be great, or simply unlock every level from the start.- The Yang Family car trip level is taking way too long with minimum obstacles- Checkpoints need to be re-calibrated with the level's obstacles. Put checkpoints before difficult obstacles, not before a long, empty road.ConclusionNote that these are based on assumptions because I have never made a map myself and I'm terribly inexperienced in creating my own map, thus please correct me if I said anything wrong.Of course, as an early access, Guts and Glory still has a long way to go. They still need to add more content to keep the users engaged (I heard they're working on flying vehicles?) and I'm glad that the devs are still actively developing the game.  If I may give a suggestion, devs should create a map editor template to allow users easily create maps by themselves and challenge their friends. Happy Wheels lives for a long time due to this user-generated system, I'm sure Guts and Glory can go for the same strategy. For such cheap price, it's worth it to purchase Guts and Glory. Plus, it's also always nice to support indie game developers with good quality games. If you enjoyed Happy Wheels, you'll enjoy Guts and Glory. The hilarity of the gameplay  definitely has more value than the price.I hope my review can be helpful for you - thank you for reading!			",185,23,8,11,22,1,19

Early Access Review
								**WORK IN PROGRESS REVIEW**#####42.8 hours playtime as of release of review. This review is for the initial Early Access release v0.4.0 (I hope to update it when the game gets updated) and may not accurately reflect the current state of the game.#####Discovery: Discovered the game from Youtube videosMethod of acquisition: Beta testerReason for purchase: N/ACompletion: Completed all available official levels. Overview Guts and Glory is an awesome physics-based obstacle/racing game in the likes of Happy Wheels. It is obviously inspired from Happy Wheels, which is a very popular free flash game, and in my opinion Guts and Glory is superior. For starters this game has an official campaign and story for each of it's characters, which was great fun to play. But perhaps the most major factor is the fact that this game is 3D. I think that the developer has nailed the execution of bringing Happy Wheels into the 3rd dimension, but Guts and Glory is much more than that. It is it's own spectacular game on it's own. Components Visuals - This game has very vibrant and cheerful aesthetics which aim to convey humorous and wacky vibes as opposed to dark or cruel. While the graphics aren't especially great, they get the job done substantially. The lighting and shadows is done perfectly, and looks quite good at night time (one particular level involves navigating a night-time map using the cars headlights and I found it to be very fun). The graphical effects are very well done. Flames from nitrous boosts look awesome, and the blood effects are great. There's sometimes even bones sticking out from severed limbs! Nasty, but cool! Overall, Guts ad Glory has good graphical fidelity.Audio - Guts and Glory has a great plethora of sound effects. Explosions, saws, crashes, cries of pain, every action has a matching sound. The sounds are implemented very well. They're satisfying and really amplify the experience. Guts and Glory's music is pretty good too. There's a nice variety of tracks.Gameplay - The gameplay of Guts and Glory is definitely the best part about it. The goal of the game is to reach the finish line of each level. However, every level is filled with hazards and traps designed to kill you. And dying in this game can be very spectacular thanks to the ragdoll physics, dismemberment and gore mechanics. There are a wide variety of traps ranging from spikes to wrecking balls and more are planned. There are currently 4 characters in this game (A tandem bicycle, an ATV, a family SUV and a rocket-propelled lawn-chair guy), with the first 3 having their own set of unique levels. These levels are great fun and have some uniquely challenging obstacles. One level involves using the ATV for logrolling, where you need to drive backwards on a log to push it forward. These clever physics-based challenges are really awesome and I hope to see more of the sort. Almost everything in this game has physics, including the hazards, and there's no preset animation for the characters (they're 100% ragdoll).  Level Editor & Community Content  - Guts and Glory has an in-built level editor, which is extremely versatile and very powerful. Surprisingly, I found the level editor of Guts and Glory to be easier and faster than Happy Wheels', and it's actually really fun to use too. I've made 19+ levels which you can check out here. Because of the level editor and Steam workshop integration, there is a limitless amount of content. Story - Each level has a bit of storyFunctionality - Guts and Glory is a very well polished game. During testing there were a few bugs encountered, but there's almost no bugs left now. The optimisation is great and I can run it smoothly (100+FPS) on the highest settings with very few drops. Guts and Glory has great functionality and should be able to run on weaker systems easily. Pros  Wacky physics and ragdolls Powerful and fun-to-use level editor Nice graphical effects and great optimisation Limitless amount of content Fun and unique official campaign levels Cons 
 No guts yet! Only 2.5 sets of levels so far Level editor still missing some features such as setting time and music Conclusion If you're looking for a game like Happy Wheels, Guts and Glory will deliver that experience and more. It is a hugely fun vehicle physics game that I would recommend to anyone.			",436,92,11,30,25,2,22

Early Access Review
								Guts and Glory is a Happy Wheels-inspired 3D platformer racing game created by solo developer HakJak. Just like Happy Wheels, it has various characters that can be played through difficult levels ranging from races to cannon filled death traps. Though there are a lot of comparisons to Happy Wheels, Guts and Glory is it's own game and will become more unique as the game progresses. The game also comes with an easy to use level editor and workshop support. It is very early alpha, however, and is lacking a lot of content, UI, settings, and some polish but there is plenty to do with the editor and workshop support.Guts and Glory is about skill and chaos, speeding through race tracks, death traps, and whatever else HakJak and the community can come up with to send your character flying in as many peices as possible. Currently there is John and Jimmy, the classic Dad-Son bicycle combo, Earl the gun carrying redneck on an ATV, the Yang family in their convertible car, and Larry the crazy sonuvab*tch with a jet powered lawn chair. There are planned to be 12 total different playable characters so it will be interesting to see what else HakJak can come up with to add to the chaos. Mechanically the game is pretty solid. The physics are accurate, the dismemberment is precise and gory, the ragdolls are hilarious, the destruction physics on both environment and vehicles is satisfying, and the game overall plays very smoothly. The only thing noticeable that needs work at first is the movement of some of the characters, it takes some getting used to but it's nothing significant. All in all Guts and Glory is a game that fills a hole not many games can, Happy Wheels being the most noteable. It's a game of trials, skill, and just enjoying losing by watching your character get chopped, sliced, smashed, and torn to pieces in the most entertaining way possible in creative levels made by HakJak and the workshop community. For $10 I think this game is completely worth it if you're into survival racing/trial/skill games both because it's a blast to play and you're supporting a hard-at-work solo developer doing his best to deliver a fantastic game.

Early Access Review
								This game has lots of potential. First off, I chose to pledge on Kickstarter because I saw how this game will likely have a long lifetime in the community. The inclusion of steam workshop early on is a great start and I can't wait for all the awesome community content. I see lots of people saying Happy Wheels clone, yes the concept is the inspiration for sure but this game has much more going for it as an open sand box for destruction. I definitely look forward to the final release of the game. I hope the developer takes his time and creates something special here because I can only imagine what kind of craziness will be added to the game later on. At the time of this review there are only 4 stages with a total of 26 levels each. This was equal to about 1.5 hours of playtime for me. But like I was saying there is a steam workshop and already some community made levels available. Support this indie developer now and watch the game shine upon release, or wait because waiting is fine too, it is early access afterall. Although it's not that expensive so why not support an indie gem because you can.			",425,51,17,40,38,3,42

								Guts and Glory is so incredibly fun!I began playing this game back when it was a free demo, and fell in love with it. Inspired by Happy Wheels, you can defintely feel the similarities of this spiritual successor.While there are many pros to this game, all I feel I have to say is this:You can decapitate your wife and child by accidentally (or not accidentally) driving into precariously swinging saw blades, while in your yellow convertable, and then skid down a mountain, fly out of your seat, because you're too stupid to use a seatbelt, hold onto your car door for dear life, and then get slammed through your windshield, face-first, when you eventually hit the ground.And then get your torso torn off your dying body by a stray cannonball.So yes, I recommend this.

								This game may look simple, but its very tricky.Pros:Well Optimized for a Early Access Game* Simple and Easy ControlsLevel Editor + WorkshopCommunity Made LevelsDESTRUCTABILITY!RAGDOLLS!Dev keeps posting updates and asks for feedback (good for u!)Cons:Few Vehicles (but dev promised more is coming, so I'm just satisfied with the current ones)Fewish? Tracks (but there is the workshop for more tracks)This game does look very simple, but its pretty hard if you ask me.The first few levels may make you think ""aww this is pretty easy"" But every level afterwards is getting harder and harder.The main point of the game is to finish with the shortest time possible, going through checkpoints and obsticles. So I guess you can say this is a 3D version of Happy Wheels. You can go straight for the fastest time (which is pretty hard) or drive around and kill people... It's very simple but with workshop and community levels already being published, you can possibly play this for hours.The current state is pretty vanilla, but the dev promises alot of intresting content and I am very forward into looking for that. At this price, and this much playability, id recommended to anyone who wants a challenge. The gameplay is really tricky, but you can get used to it. I hope to see hard levels in the workshop soon.Edit:Some users may have optimability issues, im unsure how people get these, but its pretty well optimized for me. I have a card similar to a GTX660ti and run the game well on Ultra.			",284,69,25,22,39,4,19

								Guts and Glory is for all intents and purposes Happy Wheels on some sort of 3D inducing LSD.I bumped into Guts and Glory while its kickstarter was attempting to garner favour, and we're all so lucky is succeeded! Guts and Glory stands a chance to be one of those rare treats that will fuel fun for years and years.Much like Happy Wheels your task is to get from point A to point B on some sort of vehicle and all that stands between you and victory is death. This death is rought to you by: Nails. Bombs. Dodgeballs. Your own failures as a human beings. Shame. Gravity. Trees. Spiky bits on string. Spinning trees. Spinning blades. Blades launched from toasters.All of these seek to rip pieces of your body off. You can lose arms, toes, heads, children, wheels, and so forth. Want to see how far you can bike with stump legs? This is your game.Most importantly, is that this game will have stellar steam workshop support, or at least I hope. The potential for custom maps reminds me of the original Starcraft map editor. You will see things to boggle the mind. In fact last I checked, there's already 150 custom made maps. ALREADY 150 CUSTOM MAPS. That sort of joy should be owned by everyone.Pros and Cons then:Pros
 Fast, chaotic gameplay. Gore. Lose all the body parts all over the place. Custom maps show great promise, and the community is showing evidence of getting bhind the game and making BUNCHES of neat maps.cons
 Story? Basically none. The longevity of the game will be dependant on the community. Not a game with any grand goal. Think playground. Not everyone will care for the playground.So there you go. Great game. I love it. Worth a play.If you want to see the sort of thing I mean and get a feel for the game before you make the plunge you can check out my first episode of Guts and Glory here:

This is a great physics game which has already seen allot of updates since I purchased it a couple of weeks back. It has plenty of tracks, a track editor and full workshop support so you should find it hard to run out of things to do.The graphics are simplistic but functional for this sort of game, you really don't want anything too realistic when you're dismembering your family in game.The controls are somewhat sketchy at times, or more accurately the vehicles are. The bike is by far the best of the three vehicles on offer and is easily the most fun. The quad is my least favourite as it just doesn't really do anything for me, it never produces the comical outcomes that the bike does. The sports car is just plain annoying and drifts all over the place, far better suited to more open road tracks. That said, even if you don't like any vehicle but the bike, it's worth getting as this vehicle makes the game. The developer has been very active on the forum, taking feedback and releasing patches regularly. I recommend this game if you're after a good time with increasing community content on the way each day.			",76,19,4,2,5,0,1

 General Thoughts: Fairly similar to Happy Wheels in premise, gorey, explosive fun with a slightly disappointing lack of squishiness of the NPCs, objects, vehicles and player characters.The NPCs, environment and objects all look nice and the physics are very fun. Driving can be frustrating at times (such as on the bicycle), but at other times (such as with the car) it can be as fun as the explosions and flying around itself.Overall it is a very well put together game and has enormous potential. Things I would like to see: Regarding mechanics, the ability to move outside of your vehicle; some of the best levels in Happy Wheels are the ones you at some point eject from your vehicle and grab on to something. Also, squishier people, and objects.Regarding levels, it would be cool to see the quality  evolve into what you see with its inspiration: well crafted, good looking levels without the empty expanses that are so prominent in those both community made and, to a lesser extent the official levels. Things I think could improve: Camera angles, more options with checkpoints and objectives (such as options in paths) ",46,3,0,5,4,0,2

								yeah funny physics based guts and glory game - needs a hell of a lot more levels to be worth the full price and needs a lot of polishing round the edges but has great potential and the odd laugh here and there - managed to finish one race with my left leg chopped off and my right leg pushing the left pedal - will only keep it because it makes my kids laugh a hell of a lot. But you know dont expect anything serious like - I am reccomend this but only to hardcore physics and guts game fans really ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								this is easy one of the best violent arcade racing/time trial games i have played, all vehicles have a dynamic based damage setup and the characters have a soft body type of dismemberment when you get into a bad crash, the game may not look pretty for todays standards, but it makes up for it in really fun racing style gameplay, i only have 1.2 hours into this so far but with there being a level editor and workshop support i am guaranteed to have a whole lot more hours of gameplay to come, if you like the flash game happy wheels or just violent racing games, then i highly advise to pick this game up, its on sale for it's first weak on steam then it only cost $10 afterwards, the Dev ""HakJak"" treats his fans with great respect and loves getting feedback and ideas.

I would definitely recommend trying out this release of the game, more has been added, the graphics have improved and as I mentioned - there is a level of polish to the game which makes it feel much more solid. The performance is much better too. One thing I haven't mentioned is... this game is just stupid fun to play, lots of raging, lots of blood.Here's some gameplay:

Guts and Glory – First Impressions / PreviewSteam: Title: Guts and GloryDeveloper: HakJak ProductionsPublisher: tinyBuildPlatforms: Windows, Mac, Linux - PS4/XB1 in FutureRelease Date: Early Access February 16, 2017Price: $9.99IntroductionHey Guys, Weise, aka Thomas here, bringing you another review. Now I’m sure you’ve all heard of, and maybe even played Happy Wheels. A game made famous by a variety of YouTubers as they struggled to complete crazy stages built by a community, avoiding death and dismemberment to arrive safely at the finish line in mostly one piece. Well, now we get to experience this in 3D, with all the ragdoll physics you can handle. I’d like to invite you to compete in these extraordinary challenges of life and death in Guts and Glory, the early access game by HakJak Productions, published by tinyBuild Games.StorylineNormally when I review a game, I start with the storyline and any background elements to give you an idea of the world you are living in. Guts and Glory is a bit of a different style of game, however, and there isn’t much story to go with it. Ordinary people are competing in extraordinary challenges, attempting to survive courses from hell, with landmines, turrets, cannons, and more trying to kill them along the way. Why do they compete? We may never know, but I’d like to suggest maybe they have been chosen in a Hunger Games fashion to decide their own fate, live or die. That said, there really is no storyline here and one really shouldn’t expect one with this style of game.GameplayNow, just because there is a lack of any story or plot doesn’t mean this game is not worth playing. The style is VERY much inspired by Happy Wheels, almost to the point of being able to say this is a copy-cat game, however I think the game stands on its own as a fun experience, modernizing Happy Wheels and adding its own flair to it.You start by picking a stage, be it official or community created, then pick your character to compete with. These characters include a father son going on a nice bike ride, the redneck Earl on his four-wheeler, and the Yang Family in their sedan. Moving through the stage you need to avoid various obstacles such as cross bows, cannons, land mines, buzz saws and more.Once you complete the official maps, however, there is so much more you can still do. The game has a level-editor and Steam Workshop support, allowing you to create your own levels and share them with friends, downloading other popular levels, and really giving you endless possibilities. The game is in early access, but at full release there is a plan to have 100 official tracks, 10 unique vehicles/characters, various power-ups, and loads more obstacles and props to fill the levels, adding more variety.VisualsVisually, this game is quite graphic. With all of these obstacles, it should be mentioned the game is absolutely suited for a mature audience and is quite gory. You absolutely will be dismembered at some point, blown up into a bunch of pieces, and see your torso squirt blood as limbs are ripped off of you or you are sawn in half. That said, the game does all of this in near comic fashion, which depending on your taste, may be something you are either okay with or disgusted by.The levels themselves have fairly simplistic models, but again this isn’t a game that is going for crazy story, graphics, and more like you would find in other titles. This game is about one thing, surviving the level and doing so in as close to one piece as possible.AudioThe audio in this game is very much like the other elements I’ve discussed. The comical sounds and grunts as your character gets pummeled, blown up, and shot by the various obstacles adds to the comic relief of the gameplay. The sound effects of the crossbows, cannons, explosions, and more really do have quality and add to the overall atmosphere of this hellish land you are playing in.Replay-abilityWhere this game shines is in its replay value. I’ve mentioned that at launch, it is in early access with various features still to come, but at full release it will have around 100 levels and 10 playable characters. Combine that with the endless possibility of Steam Workshop support due to the in-game level editor, you’ll find yourself with a $10.00 game that can provide hundreds of hours of endless and unique gameplay. To me, that holds a lot of value.Overall Wrap-UpOverall, I really can’t complain about Guts and Glory. I came into it knowing it was backed by tinyBuild, a publisher that has never let me down. Combine that with a developer that is local to me (and I hope to meet sometime here) in Boise and I had to check it out. The early-access stigma has plagued many gamers, but with Guts and Glory already having the level-editor and steam workshop support, I think the $9.99 price tag is perfectly priced to allow you endless hours of fun if you are into the Happy Wheels style of gameplay.

Early Access Review
 THIS GAME WAS GIVEN TO ME AS A KEY BEFORE THE END OF DECEMBER. THIS WILL NOT CHANGE MY OPINION OF THE GAME IN ANYWAY. THIS REVIEW IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY HAKJAK AND OMEGA TRADE G, MY EMPLOYERS. Short review in progress after EA release##############################44.2 Hours as of release of review #############################################################Review will be improved after EA ################################Guts and Glory is a fantastic remake of Happy Wheels, possibly unintentionally. This game offers a variety of levels, along with a nice community who make levels while hakjak is working on patches. There are always new levels to come.I have been playing this game since sometime in November/December. I have enjoyed every second of it and I decided its time to make my own levels. Unfortunately, i am not comfortable until the game is completed, to make levels. I will soon though!Watching this game throughout development has been amazing. The first day i played it, i remembered the wacky controls, Horrible physics and some uncompletable levels due to bugs. Throughout development, and with everyones feed back, the game has became bigger, better and less buggy. Audio - Guts and Glory has a great amount of real sound effects and a good soundtrack that should be sold as a Dlc. The explosions give a great effect, along with other sounds like cries of death, saws and more. This game also supports headphones. This means that you can hear the sounds from different directions and dont hear it 24/7 in both ears, even if you are far away from it. I extremely hope that Hakjak releases a DLC for Guts and Glory Soundtrack. Certainly a must buy.Community Made Content - Guts and Glory has an in-built level editor which can be very powerful and creative. During the beta testing, over 10 levels were made by specific members of the community and some were as good as Hakjak's. The  community made content adds extra fun to the game. This means that after this game is out of EA and all the levels are done, like happy wheels, the game can continue to grow with help of the community. As long as we have a good community, this game will survive throughout harsh times.Gameplay -  The goal of the game is to reach the finish line of each level. Although it sounds easy enough, its not. There are traps and hazards set on almost every map or even some twists (reference from the Yang Family Levels). For example, you have things like saws, harpoons, arrow turrets, ball cannons and more. Sometimes you may rage for dying but luckily, our glorious leader has supplied checkpoints in every level which can be pretty satisfying. There are tons of levels and tons of characters.Graphics / Visuals - This game has incredible / smooth graphics that can look realistic time to time in different levels. There isn't anything bad I can say about the visuals. The blood and gore is very overwhelming and much more better than most gore games (i.e the game we are comparing to, Happy Wheels). This game brings joy to my heart and having the nice visuals give you a bit of determination in your system.Functionality - Guts and Glory is a very polished game. Although in my testing months there was bugs and everything, there are not many anymore. For an early access game, it is very well polished. + Amazing Controls+ Non-toxic Community+ Listening Developer+ Controller Support+ Nice music+ Level designs are epic- Levels are taking a while to come out.Overall, 9/10 Omega Trade Reviews			",414,65,11,63,49,7,37

Disclaimer: I'm not the best at reviews, so just hang in there. Also, if you're wondering why my name looks so familiar, it's because you may have recognized me on the Steam forms...I'm the Moderator of the Guts and Glory Steam community...so yeah.(I did in fact recieve a key for this game as a beta tester.)Guts and Glory is a game about father and son riding their bicycle through obstacle courses of death, and other fun family experiences (aka death, guts, gore, ect xD)*WORK IN PROGRESS REVIEW* (I decided to say that cause' everybody is saying that xD)Graphics - I have to say, the graphics are very good for a solo developer. You may think, ""OH WELL SANTA DOGE THE GRAPHICS AIN'T DAT REALISTIC!"" Well, they're meant to be cartoonish rather than realistic. Gore - The gore in this game is top notch. The only thing about this game is there's no real guts. However, you can practically see the insides of Jimmy and John.Controls - The controls of this game aren't that bad, they can be wonky at times but other than that they're pretty good.Pros and cons:+Graphics+Gore+Controls+Audio-There are no real guts falling out of bodies (which is understandable and most people would think that's too violent)OOOVVERRRALLL: 9.5/10would rate again(I did in fact recieve a key for this game as a beta tester.)

Early Access Review
								I played the demo for this game, and was overall fairly excited for it. Then I bought the early access release... and the gameplay hadn't changed at all. The only new feature was a new vehicle,better gore, and a couple  maps. For $10, this is disgraceful. Early access doesn't give a pass on a etremely basic game: once you start charging money, you had better have enough stuff already implimented to make it worth the money.			",110,9,0,10,10,0,6

								I personally like this game, but I wouldn't find it hard to believe if there is a large group of people that don't like it. It is a lot like a 3 dimentional Happy Wheels game. The reason I say that others may not like it is because it can be hard to navigate the controls, and one may find themselves more aggravated at trying to play the game then they would find themself enjoyfully challenged by it. It all depends on the person playing. That's my opinion of it anyway. I did a Let's Play on the game. It would mean the world to me if anyone who is interested could check it out. I'll put a link to it below. Have a wonderful day.

								pros-based off a fun game-probably has promise, hopefully-vehicle destruction looks pretty goodcons-explosions have no effect on gravity, just turn your character into gibs-not much original thought going on, pure happy wheels rip off-physics are not realistic, which they should be for a game like this-several of the maps contain no inherent danger, just going checkpoint to checkpoint-music sounds royalty free, which is never good-everyone needs to be in equal danger-characters fly through vehicles when hitting something too fast, causing glitchy results-turbo is horrible			",276,39,4,37,21,2,64

								""Based on"" is used loosely as almost all aspects of Happy Wheels is present: Son and Father character, exact same controls, user powered game. At least they could have thanked Jim Bonacci for STEALING his game and only making it 3d to ""change"" it. I will admit it has a lot of potential, but seeing as its early access and a rip off of a browser game theres not much to do. The game loses its playability after 30 minutes in, and thats only the very limited official maps wherein you are confined to a single character(like in happy wheels). One or two official maps let you use any character, but mostly it makes you use one specific character. These are the ""character"" introduction levels at the game seems to implying theres a story. If you have played Happy Wheels then you can see this one coming: community maps. Since the game was recently released, there are no good player created maps. Most are 10 seconds long, pander to a youtuber, or (you guessed it) are spike falls.			",34,17,3,7,15,0,1

								The game is fun, but feels very incomplete, and feels like a free-to-play game, which I think it should be right now. That's not to say that the game won't improve, because it most likely will, but right now I wouldn't buy it, or at least wait until the price drops or if it's on sale, because it can feel like a cheap standard-unity game at times.***I do not hate the game I just think it's over-priced and that it looses it's charm quickly, but if you like silly and funny games like Happy Wheels, than chances are you may enjoy Guts and Glory***			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is actually quite fun, if anyone has played Happy Wheels then this is basically that but on steroids. There seems to be a few missions already in the game and the rest are community made. Much like happy wheels.Overall so far I think this game is quite good.			",91,13,3,7,8,0,5

								one of the funniest games i have ever played!   endless fun! you can make you're own maps and experiment with cool fun and wacky things, you can also download workshop maps if you are bad at creating xD\I love the fact that its like a 3D happy wheels, which is what everyone has wanted! (i also thought it was a racist joke making the people in the car the yang family, i thought the creator was trying to say asian people cannot drive becasue of thier eyes. Im not sure if that is true though)there are only 4 characters right now, but this is a new game and im sure in the future there will be a ton more :)			",29,2,0,3,1,0,0

								Man i love this game.  Its got a bright future as happy wheels in 3d, and with a workshop the fun is nearly endless.  Also, its really fun to play with a friend.BUT DEVS, PLEASE NERF THE CANNONS, THEY RUIN SOME LEVELS WITH THEIR NEAR INSTANT KILL AND ACCURACY.8/10p.sThe bad reviews for the game are absolute bs, the game doesn't lose replayability, there are good community levels, use a controller if you suck at keyboard( i do), and saying its stolen from jim bonacci is stupid because its literally in a full 3d rendering, something i doubt jim could ever dothx			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
