												Ride Review - see under Ride discussionsAs a keen bike owner, racer & gamer, previously having played Super Bikes Riding Challenge, I am not very happy with Ride. I have done a more lengthy review of Ride which you can find under the Ride discussions where I have discussed only some of all the problems with this game. I have since also started a Ride protest page which reveals other peoples frustrations with this game under same, which most probably like all the others in my Steam unplayable games library, will most likely not be fixed. I strongly advise against buying this or other games on Steam until such time Steam are able to support them properly			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is unfinished, and from the looks of it will not be properly supported. despite my pc being above the ideal set up that they recomend, the game will not hold 30fps on the lowst settings and its framerate is all over the place, the physics that they claim are ""realistic/simulator quality"" feel like a joke compared to  that of old ps2 games, the front breaks never lock up even if you turn in fully and mash the breaks all the way.  then we get to the ai which is terible and lazy, they hardly holde a proper line and do not respect you, they will break late every corner and then some, and somehow be able to out accelrate you on the exit of every corner unless you use proper early breaking and early acceleration, (this is on the default easy setting in the first set of cups) the ability to change setups involvs using sliders which have arbitrary numbers between 1-5, never giving you enough values to properly tune the bikes to the course, and most of them fail to offer enough of a change even at max deviation compared to what they should provide. after looking up the game and its forum, I can clearly see that the developers will not support this game, nor do they care about its success and as such I can not recomend this to anyone.  if this was a early access game I might be willing to give this a wait until release, but, as its already out. skip it.

You can create a rider, play a quarter, maybe a half way through the season, and the next time you start the game, EVERYTHING will be lost. Like to start over from the beginning a hundred times?

												Milestone set out to succeed playstation 2's Tourist Trophy as the modern motorcycle racing simulator. It however falls very short of that goal. Graphics are last generation quality that somehow taxes modern video cards. The only positive things I could say about the game is it's selection of bikes and gear. But it falls short from there. It feels very shallow and geared towards the casual gamer/racing fan. Short-comings in on track riding is what ruins the game the most. It is the same arcade style simulation (an oxymoron) engine as the previous MotoGP games. Trailbraking deep is ridiculous and offers no feedback when the front wheel is at it's limit. The reactions of the bike to too much throttle is the same for every bike. Turning into the first corner is always the same even if the race just started and the front tire is still ""cold"". Then there are the small missing details. No clutch lever use even on the older bikes. The throttle hand works but the brake lever is never used, never mind the rear brake pedal on the right foot. There are ZERO braking markers for non-track circuits. Only occasionally is there a reference point like a tree or a fence, but the rider is left with nothing to judge the approach most of the time.Then there's the ridiculously aggressive AI that has no qualms of ramming passed you because somehow collisions only penalize one bike. The AI will insist on it's line even if you're in front of it and worst of all will not brake if you plan on braking earlier than it. The AI is also on a very suboptimal line The set up of the game progression is obviously an afterthought to Milestone as there is NO QUALIFYING SESSION. YOU ARE ALWAYS 8TH. Leaving you with having to deal with the 7 AI-controlled bikes that will slow you down. Then there's the classification of the bikes into races. Some are beyond lazy such as grouping the MT07 with Ducati Monsters and Triumph Street triples because they are all below 700cc. WHAT?! That's a very ignorant way to classify a class race. The MT07 MAY have a corner speed advantage, but that advantage is completely blown away on circuits with straights. Why even bother having that bike? There was no beta testing for this game. Then there's the customization for looks and performance. The biggest mistake Milestone has in this area is completely ignoring the significance of a rear shock. The whole customization is an insult to any enthusiasts who love to customize their motorcycle's performance capability. Front forks are all stock upgrades. No chance of changing oil, springs, or even valves. Seat height, wheelbase, sprocket size, rotor size, handlebar vs clipons, removal of DOT required parts like lights. Milestone also only includes a very small amount of tracks despite having the license rights to the tracks in MotoGP15. None of those tracks appear in this game. Some tracks are ridiculously unfit for racing. Miami circuit being the most obvious because the street is too damn narrow . All in all RIDE is a game made by a casual company  meant for the casual gamer. If you want a game that shows the dedication to the sport like Tourist Trophy did for the Playstation 2, you will be very disappointed.			",54,7,5,7,10,0,19

												I've probably sat here for a good few hours wondering whether to leave a positive or negative review. I think I've made my choice now.This game could of been so much more. I was so excited to play it on PC when I had a go at the Yamaha Demo at the MCN show in London. It was really looking good, but my heart sank when I purchased this at full price and recieved something I wasn't quite expecting. Pro's. -Really good customisation of Bike and Rider. -Pretty realistic movement.-Has quite a number of my favourite bikes. But I would lke to see some more earlier models.-Realistic Wheelies! (You don't pull wheelies by pulling on the handlebars like a bicycle.)-Stunning graphics and models.-Pretty awesome Multiplayer. Con's. -Only a few early models. Mostly generic modern bikes.-Only a handful of tracks.-Very random FPS drops that cause you to crash. (No, it's not my PC. My specs are on my profile.)-AI literally don't care. They just crash into you all the time.-Obvious signs of the game being unoptimized. (Laggy menu screen. Long loading times.)-Community pleads are ignored and unanswered.-Audio is pretty poor. (Lags when shifting gears up and down. Sometimes doesn't even play a sound, it's just ""Brruummm. -Silence.- Brrruuuummmmmm. -Silence.-"")-♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC. ""Yamaha Historical Bikes"" = R1, R1, R7. What happend to the FZR 750? Thundercat? FZR 1000? FZS 600? All in all, I really wish I could thumb it up. But it needs some serious patching, I feel like I'm playing a game in Early Access.

												First of all the game looks nice. It presents a lot of options in terms of customization, but only just touches the surface in that area. The physics are below average. Bikes doesnt react to surroundings correctly, and the man himself desperately needs a ragdoll effect, which cant be that hard to make since we've seen that in lesser good games like Flatout, Flatout 2, Motocross game from 10-15 years ago. Milestone doesnt have any real competition on the Motorcycle game market and therefore do not feel the need to up their game at all. Same physics and controls as the last 2-3 MotoGP games. Poor network options - that rarely works, and when you succeed in connection to your friends, the game lags out and people disconnect with each other leaving you alone with bots.The WORST thing about MotoGP through ALL the years and now also RIDE is the quality of sound. Computer sounds, made by what obviously must be people who havent heard the real thing IN REAL LIFE. The sounds these machines make are worse than car games 15 years ago. You have the rights to MotoGP, you dont have any competition - GO out and record the ♥♥♥♥ing machines to deliver it to us when we game it. Most of the purchases unfortunately done of this game, is by people riding a motorcycle, so we KNOW the sounds. My first machine was a Yamaha MT07 with an IXIL exhaust on. That doesnt exist in the game but Akrapovic does. Its looooud like a beast with Akra on IRL - but ingame it sounds like the engine sound comes from an iPhone.Disgustingly bad :).If you can come to terms with having to mute your game, because having no sound will annoy you less than having the sound on?! - then its STILL almost a waste of money.Now RIDE 2 is on the way. People are ALREADY in the comments to RIDE's trailers and also RIDE 2's trailers writing ""WE WANT REAL SOUNDS"" - if they ignore us, us being the ones who pay for the damn thing, one more time.... i HOPE it will have consequences. Or at least give another studio the ide to start making Superbike or MotoGP bike games again!			",52,0,18,0,4,0,0

												This game is great but it keeps losing my data so i lose all of my rep this has happened twice to me. + The physics are good you can lose the front and you can highside so that keeps you on your toes not like tourist trophy. + The bikes feel like they have a weight to themn to pull them down to the apex requires some skill with no assists. + Allot of content I have around 30 bikes and have compleated about a quarter of the game in total not including losing my saves.+ There is a good amount of licenced parts for the bikes and for your riders gear.+ Runs well with everything at the highest and AA on x2 my 270x runs most tracks at 60fps and some like the road tracks I get around 50 avarage. The juddering from the demo is not in the final game. + AI is clever enough to make well thought out overtakes I have not once been t boned by a wild AI.- It deleted my data.- It did it again.- I'm not sure it will stand the test of time like Tourist Trophy but im sure if they added the TT mountain course then it would!

												Forza with bikes pretty much. A very nice feeling bike game, which is extremely rare to come by. Last enjoyable bike themed games have to be Tourist Trophy or Moto GP2, but this game has the ability to live up to those titles.Only trouble ,for me atleast, was picking the Yamaha MT07 as a start bike, as I found it a bit difficult to get off the ground due to the ai competitors being on faster bikes. Once I got round that though, I managed to get a good bike out of a decent lineup, and have a blat round a few of the tracks, which have really amazing design/quality. Will require a pretty powerful PC to run efficiently however.			",102,10,18,5,5,1,1

												I wanted to like this game, but I can't. It has fundamental flaws that make it unenjoyable for me.This is a shame because the content (the tracks, bikes, music etc) is all really good. I also got decent enough performance (outside of the load times).The worst problem is the handling. I think I figured out what the main 'cause' is, and this seems systemic of all Milestone bike games I've played:The tyres float across the track. You can see this even when not moving. Just lean left and right and look at the back tyre, it glides right and left respectively across the surface of the track when it should remain in the same place. This effect only gets worse at higher speeds, with the tyres gliding left or right by almost a whole foot when leaning.This isn't just the contact patch moving to the side of the tyre, its the whole tyre sliding as if there is no contact patch, and its not a power slide (it happens all the time), and it seemingly affects all 'modes' (pro and the rest).Overall this make the bikes horrible to handle.It's like there is no physics between the tyre and the track surface, as if the pivot point when leaning is somewhere in the middle of the bike instead of at the contact patch of the tyres. This is absolutely not a 'simulation', it's an arcade game (and, imo, a very flawed one at that).Also, some of the rider animations/'physics' are super messed up (like a crazy 'superman' somersault your rider will do during endos).And annoyingly there appears to be no practice or quali sessions, so to practice new tracks you have to go to Time Trials, which involves going through a bunch of slow loading menu screens.The other issues I had are mainly UI related:- Terrible loading screens throughout the menus.- Split time between riders not shown in-game.- Best lap time not shown in game.- Being unable to change controls in-game (have to exit out to the main menu first).- Being unable to un-assign controller buttons (so nothing is mapped to it).- Being unable to assign multiple buttons to single actions.- Unnecessary confirmation screens, like having to click proceed instead of backing out after a race, or having to re-confirm your bike (when you select a race your bike is already chosen, then get a loading screen, then have to choose your bike again - even if you only have 1 bike, then get another loading screen).- Game trying to 'sync' and failing, causing an error message you have to confirm. You can switch 'sync' off, but it re-enables itself each time the game is restarted.- Having to manually re-purchase enhanced oil after every single race.- A second or two delay between model updating when changing visual stuff (like helmets, leathers, bike parts etc), making custimising a time consuming process.- Key prompts always being for keyboard keys, even when using a controller.Some of the above may seen like nit-picking, and it is, but each little inconvenience adds up.Maybe some of the above has fixes and I missed it, but if I did its not obvious to me where it is.A real shame. So close to being a great game, yet so far.			",783,258,36,143,55,9,120

												I'm going to compare this title a lot to MotoGP 14 because that's the game I've been playing alongside this.Ride has an overall feeling of being unpolished and rushed. Riding in the cockpit view reveals some horrible mirror reflections (if you can even call it that) and some messed up reflections on most wind screens. I really thought they would fix this before the official release but no, it's still there and it looks really bad. The graphics can look pretty good at times and pretty bad other times, often being somewhere in between. I feel MotoGP 14 is having a bit more consistency in the graphics department although it has some problems as well.The engine sounds are mostly uninspiring and often really dull sounding in my opinion (I play in cockpit view), although the engine sound gets a bit better on some of the supersport bikes. This problem, again, is shared at times in MotoGP 14. Sounds other than the engines are lacking as well (the wind starts to blow at 200 km/h). I can't comment on the music because I always turn it down in racing games.The handling of the bikes in Ride is stiffer and a bit more forgiving than in MotoGP 14 and this, for me, takes away from the fun. I think MotoGP 14 manages to pull off a lot better handling, although it might take a bit longer to get used to than in Ride.The implementation of upgrading your bike is very lacking in my opinion. I like that sort of thing in games like Forza or Gran Turismo but in here it just feels like a tacked on feature with a lot of unused potential. I actually prefer the ""level up"" system in MotoGP 14 even though that has some unused potential as well. Maybe a combination of the two could be pretty sweet. It's pretty cool to be able to customize the look of the bikes but again, it is lacking there as well as there are mostly minor changes that you can adjust.The carrer and the way you progress through the game is obviously taken from games like Forza and Gran Turismo but it never really captivated me here, while I often have a difficult time trying to put down the controller playing MotoGP 14.I keep trying to like this game but it just isn't that good, in my opinion. It can function as an alright break from the more solid MotoGP 14 with Ride's different types of bikes and tracks but most of the time I just can't get enough enjoyment out of this game to keep playing it for a lengthy period of time, even though it does have its moments.It is really hard to decide if I sould recommend this game or not. I'd say only get it on a sale if it's really cheap unless you're a big fan of bike games.+ A pretty nice collection of bikes and tracks you won't find in most other bike sims.+ Sometimes the graphics shine for those screenshots of you favourite bikes.+ Some events are actually pretty fun.- Bike handling feels pretty stiff in my opinion.- Graphics errors are way too prominent and hard to look past (if you're riding in cockpit view).- The sound is really lacking overall, with some exeptions.- Upgrade system feels rushed.- Prone to crash			",181,14,19,16,15,1,14

Then Milestone lost a fan with their buggy WRC game (corrupt save games).I thought I will never buy a Milestone game again, when I read about the save game errors in Ride.But I liked the demo and I like motorcycle games. Bought it finally during the sale (Read some developer feedback, they seem to care a bit more now than back with WRC). Played for 7 hours on the first day and it is a great game. (It crashed once but save game was not lost). Looking forward to tune my bikes in the next weeks!Forget what I wrote save game bug still there!Back up does fail as well.

												Ride is probably the best motorcycle video game since Tourist Trophy on PS2. There's been many MotoGP and WSBK games, but not many that use real-world motorcycles. I do enjoy riding some of the lesser known, or less racing-orientated bikes, its unusual.The gameplay is good, not amazing, but good. Sometimes the rider can be a little sluggish, almost like a deliberate input lag of sorts. Its most noticeable when switching directions quickly in a chicane, the rider will be noticeably delayed in swapping his body position on the bike. Sometimes the 'simulation' style of gameplay where excessively hard braking or hard acceleration causes the bike to squirm or slide aren't particularly smooth or realistic. There isn't that many tracks in the game, the selection will get repetitive after a while.The graphics are ok, the bikes and tracks look fair enough but the riders standing helmetless next to the bikes in the menus look ridiculous. 10years have passed since video game characters looked this simplistic.The audio, where do I start? Its terrible. Truly aweful. The bikes noises are appalling, I turned them off long ago, like some weird electronically generated whine. The best motorcycle engine noises in a video game ever, are in Burnout Paradise. And bikes are a side show in that game! Come on! Get your act together.Summary:Pros:- Great Selection of bikes, even some older 80's and 90's calssics.- Fast access to decent bikes, no need to spend hours riding slow bikes (unless you want to).- Decent on-bike graphics.- Decent controls.- Bike customization is limited, but still relatively well implemented. A tuned bike is still noticeably faster than the standard version.Cons:- The sound is abysmal. Bikes sound dreadful.- Some glaring omissions as far as bikes are concerned.- Helmetless riders look ridiculous, very dated.- Controls can sometimes feel delayed.- Some occassional dodgey slides where the physics don't add up.- Bike customization could have been better. Custom paint jobs, maybe even workshop support for cutom graphics kits etc. Why can I remove all the mirrors and indicators on some, but some leave the indicators when you choose this option? Where are the race fairings with no lights?- Limited number of tracks.Ultimately if you like bike racing games, this one is great, I may have been critical, but it can be very fun and its nice racing around on something that isn't necessarily a fully fledged race bike.

												Its far from perfect but still manages to be quite an enjoyable racing experience. The bikes are exquisitely detailed and theres a sizable variety of them ranging from 80s oldschool street bikes to modern electric superbikes, most of which can be modified and same goes for the rider, the tracks on the other hand... not so much, however they're still well designed and are really fun to race around in.Now what truly appeals to me with RIDE is how racing is only half the battle, the other half is actually wrestling with G-forces and keeping your rider on the bike to actually race, which adds a whole new level of depth to the experience. Knowing that if you're not gentle enough on the throttle or too hard on the brakes your rider is just gonna get launched into orbit, so finesse is a must. Compared to MotoGP(same studio) I'd say the physics are a lot more complex and feel way more realistic although it could've used some more polish in that department.The biggest issue with this game to me is how it feels like the game suffers from some occasional frametime lag, my rig is nothing fancy(2500k/gtx760/8gb) but it still manages to run [at the expense of a bad comparison] any codesmasters game like a dream with consistent frametimes and those games tracks' level of graphical of fidelity is by far superior, so after turning off some modern fluff settings i still had to tone it down even further in order to minimize the frametime lag. Another issue I have with this is how the AI racers seem a bit too rigid, and by that I mean they dont care if you're right in front of them, they wont bother braking and will just plow right through you if you happen to be in their way, it doesn't always happen but it does happen. Another minor but none the less irritating little problem I have is how the mirrors aren't actual mirrors and just look stupid in first person view, luckily you can take them off and pretend like you're just doing it for the sake of aerodynamics.Really this review just made me realize how much I want codesmasters to make this exact type of game on their engine, but until that day there's RIDE.

												Awefully good and at the same time bad. The playability and the physics is brilliant. The lack of actual communication is horrendous and takes no time in ignoring the bugs until mass repporting from the community. Even then they are vague and not connected to the ones concerned. The game has many bugs, the sounds pop and coding leaves bike components disconnected From the track surface.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game undoubtedly has a good graphical set-up with some seriously good visuals to give your eyes something nice to see. Although be it good looking, it's not exactly the best in it's entire delivery.Now, I have played motorsport racing games prior that not only include a Nintendo classic but MotoGP 13 as well. In my personal opinion, MotoGP 13 is probably one of the best racing games out there. I personally do not think Ride gives it a run for it's money but does have a few perks of it's own. Ride is a motorcycle racing game that entices players with it's various bike selection and decent gameplay. The selection of bikes ranges from naked bikes, historical bikes to super bikes each with their own sort of feel (regarding handling) and power. I start off with this point as it's the most influential part of the game as all the big names from Triumph, Kawasaki, Yamaha to KTM are all here. The rest is give or take - alright at best.The control scheme is decently immersive and accurate at certain times. There is the manual tuck that the player can choose to activate on top of other manual options (brake assistance and transmission settings). The braking system feature for example has two separate buttons for front brake and rear brake. Cool because that does make sense. The issue here though is the handling and braking throughout the turns (or before I should say). That ""stiff"" feeling of turning or tapping your stick to the right or left is still there. Instead of punishing the player for letting go of the left stick (turning control) too quickly, the rider slowly comes back to an upright position. Even if you're fooling around and tapping the stick left and right, it still has a choppy motion instead of a smooth movement.I understand the player is flicking the stick but as I've said, the game should punish sloppy or quick movements that would break a trajectory. On top of that, the turning doesn't feel as rewarding as it should. In MotoGP 13, taking a turn at a high speed and keeping that lean was what made it epic. Here, it doesn't really feel like you're doing anything epic at all, just another turn so to speak. What I will give the game credit for though is coming out of a turn. This feels like it was done right especially with higher powered bikes. If the player begins to floor the gas (so to speak) the bike's rear tire will start spinning out of control and slowly start putting the player at risk. The effects of this are cool and do make for split second decisions in how to recover. Problem is even if you do sort of muck up, the rider will go through a small animation looking like he's falling then recover given you did your part. These animations feel stiff and don't move with the bike as well as are sort of misleading. The crashes in MotoGP 13 felt a lot better than they do here (according to my personal contrast)! I think the animations could have been more relative rather than putting the same one for every situation.The graphics as I've mentioned are really good and the visuals and details on the bikes are quite excellent. Problem is games not only have to look good, they should also play well. The bike designs will make you stop for a moment and especially enjoy any modifications you've made to the bike (which can be seen). Then there are small things like nothing reflecting properly off the mirrors that could drive someone nuts. Some tracks it seems as though they put a repeating loop onto the mirrors. What is nice is that you'll see your player switching gears and letting go of the gas. The sounds are relatively good (not the best) but does give the player something different to listen to when switching bikes. Crash effects more or less sound the same and could have used a bit more diversity here (even though it's not the point of the game)! The music in-game is alright but I would argue the menus sound better.So why MotoGP 13 over this game? I feel that overall the other game albeit doesn't have as many bikes as Ride, still provides for a better motorcycle simulation game than this. If they made Ride more of an arcade sort of racer and mixed some simulation points into the game, I feel it could have gone better. What is completely appalling is the fact there are SO MANY LOADING SCREENS! Why does it load to a confirmation screen to show my bike once I've already chosen which bike I want to use!? Makes no sense! If you want more diversity in bikes, you may like this game. I play MotoGP in first person when I race whereas here I find I'm stuck playing in 3rd due to things not feeling exactly right. The game does boast a nice career mode where the player can take part of many world tours with different sets of bikes. On top of that, the maps are pretty good and could give the MotoGP 13 maps a run for their money. Also, the game clips randomly for me sometimes (and have noticed others having the same problem). This can be disastrous in key moments. Additionally, the leader boards don't seem to work either.I will recommend it but you'll definitely have to be a bike/race enthusiast to really enjoy it.RATING : 6.9/10 Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B+ Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ScreenShots : Probably one of my better screenshotsThe ""go-to"" animation for almost falling off a bikeI'm sure this is considered showing offStoppie and WheelieI like to start in styleWhat a naked bike looks likePeople do this in real life ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

												I have generally liked Milestone products and havent jumped on the ""Milestone sucks and make's EA look like saints"" bandwagon. I have WRC4 and MXGP and thorougly enjoy them. Put 12 hours into Ride now and am very much enjoying it. Like all race games I feel there are things that can make it better but thats just me. The gameplay is fun and challenging (put it on hard/realistc on pro handling with tcs and anti wheelie off and tell me its easy!) a good selection of bikes but not enough in my opinion. The graphics on the bikes are gorgeous and being able to customise the bike is a really nice feature. I am however a little annoyed at the moment as there is a bug going round (see forums) that wipes your data randomly after an autosave. I got to rank 9 in my 12 hours and all of a sudden ""data corrupt"" I hope this will be fixed as I am now going to take a break from this game as I'm slightly bemused!Even though the game has shafted me, I still can't leave it a negative.My only 3 problems with the game,1: Lack of bikes.For example, Naked class but no Bandits or Hornets? Arguably the most famous nakeds. No 400cc Class would love some of the 400 screamers. Only one 2T? Thats unfair finally a game with 2T's again and its just 1? Why no RGV, NSR etc? Not enough Twins, Not even the awesome SV650S/10002: Sound: Has the Milestone sound crew every heard a Ducati L-Twin or even a big V-Twin like the VTR or TLR? Judging by the sound they make in this game I'm going to say no. I think its fantastic to see some twins in a game like the mighty TLR but it sounds awful, aslo if a Ducati with Termongonis sounded that weak in real life wouldent that be awful. The only bikes that sound ""right"" are the inline 4's. If fairness to Milestone most game companies get the sound wrong.3: Data LossIt wiped my bloody game at rank 9 with 12 hours gameplay ffs

												i will talk about this game in sections.1st is that from a technical standpoint the bikes are great, awesome models and great weight and feel.The sense of achievement from upgrading and racing is ""gran Turismo"" like. The difficulty makes you feel good when u get it right and punishes you for mistakes.sound quality isn't as great as i thought it would be but it doesn't break the game.Graphics are good.....textures are brilliantly detailed, But, it does use about half my 980's raw power and seems a little OTT for a racer.not too many options could limit its scalability.i am not a biker and i love car sims to pieces but this is my first foray into bikes and i love it.the track selection could be bigger and i would love the isle of man TT to be on here, but i feel DLC's will be incoming.it is worth the money i paid for it and i recommend it fully.i welcome questions on my review and hope for feedback.B.

												RIDE has its flaws but there's no major problem not to recommend it to any motorcycle enthusiast. It does the job to render good riding sensation, the bikes selection is large, there could be more tracks but there's a pleasant mix of real & theme based (Japan, Wales, French riviera..) course.As you probably know, there's no real competition for motorcycle racing game. Many reviews here refers to Tourist Trophy on PS2 (2006) and even Superbike 2001 (GP500 anyone?). Now if you're one of those that have not been convinced by MotoGP piloting model, i'd suggest you give this one a try.Indeed it's rather close to Tourist Trophy in terms of sensation, bikes feels a little bit lighter and the speed effect is more convincing in RIDE. With all assistance desactivated, careful attention is needed on acceleration and braking. If you've never ride a motorcycle, it does matter to brake with the rear brake first then front (and also brake straight and never use the front brake when turning) and RIDE renders all of that.Now the flaws. First it's not very beautiful, i mentioned speed effect and i'd add motorbike models are well done, the rest is outdated. Textures are blurry, background landscape is terrible, no wow effect here. Sounds are failed for 2 cylinders engine (come on guys you're developping from italy), and changing your exhaust doesn't help. Prepare your own tracklist as well. There's also the ""AI"" that goes from buggy to terrible, at first it's funny to see an AI going wheelie at some start, but the constant ramming is ruining the fun at times.Recommended to all poor thirsty racers in need of something to keep up. After almost 10 years since Tourist Trophy guys, let's just hope it's not the last of its kind. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												this game is really good. all of the bikes are rendered with so much detail, did I mention you can customize it.. yes you can.  you can also cusomize your rider - helmet / shields - track suits - gloves - and boots!  they also have the casual style with jeans/jackets.  Helmet designs are updated, 3 brands to choose from - SHOEI / Arai / AGV  -real helmet you see in store is in the game. using the xbox controller takes time to get used to if you havent played it, but couple of laps and  you will be flying trough those turns in no time. I'm running it on max settings and no hiccups - smooth as butter. - its the Gran Turismo for bikes -Pro's:- Good Graphics - Highly detailed bike / tracks- Plenty of Motorcycle to choose from- Different Class / from classic oldies all the way up to Prototype and electric. trust me, if you ride one in real life - you will love this game... unless maybe you're one of those grumpy old harley riders.  sorry no harleys here.- Customization is plenty for the gear headscons: - not really a con but my bike is not listed on this game :(  -  no Hayabusa !!

												This game was better than I had expected. The graphics aren't the greatest but the most important things, the bikes, look good. The controls are good but I highly recommend a controller. AI is dumb and tends to ride on rails for the most part but do pose a challenge until you upgrade your motorcycle. The customization is good but wish there was more. The rider gear selection is only limited to 3 companys but spans multiple colors and level of gear. Motorcycle customization is similar and needs a wider variety. The only complaint I have of now is I'm stuck in windowed mode and the micro stuttering but can look past it until a patch is released. I would recommend this game even with the limited customization and minor bugs to any racing fan and definitely a motorcycle enthusiast. Its a good effort of being like Forza except for motorcycles.			",104,4,8,14,14,0,1

												Definitely the best motorbike racing game out so far.I'll try to list it in simple Pros and Cons to save you some time:PROS:- Wide range of difficulty and assists to suit most players- Decent range of bikes (though DLC doesn't add much more)- Good physics- Good graphics- Good bike customization- Brilliant rider customization- Tracks that the game has are good- Generally fun with a fair amount of replay valueCONS:- Not that many tracks- DLC adds virtually nothing to the game- Colour customization is limited to OEM variants- Some bikes sound pretty crappy- Awkward to play without a controller- Multiplayer is basically non-existant- Optimization is kinda shakyOverally I'd recommend the game and say it's a solid 7/10ALSO, many people complain about the game getting really low FPS, I too had this problem and struggled to get over 25 FPS with a GTX970, however this is just a dumb bug with the game that is easy to bypass, all you have to do is alt-tab out of the game and then go back onto it, and your FPS should be sorted, before vsync I went from 25 to 230 FPS using this fix, so before anybody puts you off with that bug, it is easily fixed.

												I really don't know what all the people are complaining about as far as fps drops or bugs but my experience so far has been nothing but fun. I do agree that there is lack of updating and support for the game right now. As far as I can tell, its the best modern motorcycle game there is out there, the feel of the motorcycle and the modification aspect of it all makes it quite special for me. You can tell when you are pushing it to far and will find the motrocycles that best fit your riding style.If you like the aspect if modding your ride and two wheels then this is as good as it gets so far!

												Decent enough. When I bought the game over a year ago I was hoping for for it to be the Gran Turismo of motorcycles and in some ways it is, however, it falls short of being complete. It could use more of a selection of bikes, more customization, and more of a track selection. Menu inputs seem a bit laggy.On a high note the RIDE has some amazingly beautiful bike models and is a stunning game (granted you have the PC to play it).I give it a 6-7/10 overall, not bad.

												I have 10 hours on the game and have loved it. It’s at the point where it’s boring though.I believe there is no other motorcycle game that can compete with this game. You have real bikes, real brands (mods and clothing). The AI is incredibly hard – depending on your bike for the class it can be very difficult to podium or win on very easy mode! With a very good bike for the class you can then play on medium or easyI have not experienced the bugs that people hate (yet). Keep in mind haters will be much more vocal than people that have no issues with the game!!!!There are some very minor details that bigger developers wouldn’t miss eg saving default camera view, higher textures for the loading and menu screens, skipping bike preview while loading and saving gearbox and suspension settings for future races!Just research how to back up your save game to be safe!

												As a fan of Milestone's MotoGP series and RIDE, I can only recommend this game to everyone who loves motorcycle racing.I consider myself as an pretty experienced motorcycle racer due to those games, and RIDE feels really great.If you like motorcycles, motorcycle racing and actually know how to race a motorcycle, than you'll be saticefied with the accomplishments in RIDE. Difficulty greatly depends on your ability to RIDE, with or without any assists, AI setting on very easy or realistic AI setting. The ability to RIDE and to RIDE perfectly lies in practice, practice... and guess what... practice.  Learn each track at your own pace, feel how each bike handles diffirently due to their characteristics. Put on your helmet, choose your motorcycle... and let's RIDE			",305,56,43,23,77,0,24

												Very promising game, but never buy games on promises. The whole frame work is good, but the developers leave much to be desired. They do not give any feedback or interaction in the forums. You leave bug reports and they are just ignored. The game is too unfinished and buggy. The physics are more arcadey, which for a developer that does the GP game as well, is pretty shocking. I played one of their older GP games and it was very bad. On top of all the issues, they just ignore all that and bring out DLC that does not address the main game flaws, It seems like they just want to rip people off.I have been riding bikes in RL for many years and many types of bikes. From my play time in the game, I can tell you that every bike is based off of the same poor physics template, they all handle all exactly the same, just some steer a little faster or some a little slower. They need to do a lot of work on the physics side of things, because it is far from realistic. Seems like plain lazy developers, and how they got the GP license I will never know. These developers are giving the game industry a bad name, I can't believe these people have no morals or care for what they do. I know I am being harsh, but I am fed up, Very disappointed :-(I have told all my friends and family to stay away from this. I suggest people do the same, they will never learn when your nice.

												While this game is hands down one of the best looking and playing MC racing games I have played in a long time, the save file bug just makes this game not worth the money. I unfortunately found out about this bug after I had already put in a considerable amount of time in to the game and found that all of the bikes I had been winning in the Elite races were not in my garage.I have requested a refund from Steam due to the developer's lack of attention to the community and failure to fix such a major bug 4 months after the release of the game. I feel that I may be stuck with the game though. But that won't stop me from warning others to stay away.			",252,76,22,51,46,4,59

												It's a lot of fun with a good amount content plus the DLC however it does suffer from quite a few issues... There is no proper livery editor which isn't really a big problem definetely not game-breaking but it would be nice to at least have the option, the ai even on the hardest difficulty are a breeze and when you get the opportunity to race side by side with them they are pretty much brain-dead... Unless if you are well and trully ahead of them under brakes going into a corner they will turn into you and just try to follow the racing line. I personally had A LOT of issues trying to run the game properly until after about a couple of hours of searching and testing I managed to find the right settings and was finally able to play the game but even then the gameplay felt choppy and not particurarly pretty. Even with everything turned on the game doesn't look great. Finally online is a ghost town... Basically no one is playng and it is a shame because the game isn't bad but it is unrefined. However it's only the first installment in this series of games so I think I can give the devs a break because the game in it's core is quite a lot of fun and definetely worthy of my money!

												Is this game good? Yes... at sale price.The pros of this game is the basic gameplay, it's a really fun hybrid of arcade and sim that really nails the balance. It reminds me alot of the old MotoGP game from the early 2000s that leaned more towards sim racing. It has a good variety of bikes, could have used more tracks and variants to keep things fresh as you play.Now the problem is the content, it really isn't anything to write home about. It very much feels like a 90s game where gameplay was pretty much what you got. I'm comparing to modern racers where there is more than just racing. Think of that Gride game where there was a progression from season to season. Think of games like NFS shift (that this game borrows from a bit) where you had different categories you raced in. Yes you kind of have it in this where you race in different classes but it's not as well done. Think of how much customisation you get nowadays.Basically this is a nice game but quite bland. There aare still some bugs and glitches but nothign that broke gameplay or crashed the game for me. It's all just unpolished and could use more game modes and content.			",149,23,9,11,17,0,21

												I don't know, initial shock came from the STEEP learning curve, even with all easy options on, this game can punish you for any and all mistakes (You can use the rewind function without penalty to your winnings and 7th place still nets decent reward money). BUT, soon as you push on and practice and get better and start winning, this game is very rewarding and fun! Uh take special note though, until your skills have increased, pay attention to the lead bike during the race and what they're riding, then get the same bike and upgrade the heck out of it, and winning will become more manageable, don't just go for your favorite manufacturer (Yamaha, much love for you, but the MV Agusta destroys the FZ-07 in the straights, got to beat em' in the turns). Like, srsly the starter bike is the naked class, and if you get a twin, all the triples (Friggin MV Agusta) for the first tier races will SPANK you. There is still a decent reward even for 7th place wins while you get practice to get better, but SRSLY pay attention to what the leader is riding and the bike stats when you are buying. Rest of the races are fairly well balanced and there is a lot to Unlock, plenty of tracks, and plenty of race types. I am enjoying it! Also, get used to the Turning/Rider mechanics, even with a far inferior bike you can beat em' in the turns!			",41,2,2,3,1,0,1

												Best game in the genre imo. 8.5/10I have been a biker for over 20 years, owned Harley Sportster 883 to Rice Burners and find the game to be a good balance as its more sim but has some arcade appeal. Riding down the nice scenic roads with a few friends was nice and this has that feel.The bikes seem accurate. I finally got to ride a Ducati Monster! You can upgrade your bikes with some events or grinding, they also have the option of renting tons of supersport bikes for free if you want to test them out without earning credits which is good. Tons of custom upgrades too. The competition of course increases or rides the same type of bikes making it harder since you have a less margin of error with faster bikes. Wish it had a few more tracks though, esp roads since motogp has very similar the tracks and gameplay.PROS: +Just enough tracks and nice scenic roads to cruise (could use more).+Good balance sim/arcade for casual fun but ample realistic elements+Ample bikes (some grinding for credits required), upgrades and features (front/back braking for differ impacts) You can't brake or excellerate hard in a turn without wiping out. You can turn too hard while going too slow either which is fairly accurate.Ride is very similar to Motogp15 which is also made by Milestone, so they seem to have a decent formula and by simply making a few changes, but that is mostly just race-tracks with limited scenerey so can all seem the same after awhile. Glad they made this with some nice roadways rather than all racetracks.CONS: I had some tech issues with Ride and motogp 14 on my last pc which was just below the specs, but thought I could lower the graphics quality however it froze my pc for some reason. So its not optimized the best since many AAA games played on it fine. So ensure you exceed the specs..These are my first impressions, 8 of 10 since this genre has limited options and junk like the game motorcycle club all should steer far away from. If you like bikes go to the rallies in Daytona Beach, NYC, Rott in Austin, TX etc, nice time with ladies, bikes and fun.			",313,64,48,19,11,3,23

												If you're looking for a motorcycle racing game, look elsewhere. Simply put, ride just isn't very good.There are loads of problems with this game, from poor optimization to a very clunky interface. The worst thing, however, is the fact that the motorcycles just don't feel very fast or exciting.Having owned and been on several motorcycles I can tell you that real motorcycles feel much faster, and sound much better. Now I'm not suggesting that this game should completely replicate the experience, but at the very least they can get the sound right.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is awesome.  This is basically the only street bike racing game besides the motogp series which id rather not spend money on.  I love riding motorcycles so im naturally going to like this game.  The riding is a little hard to get used to but you will get it in a few hours of playing.  Sure there are some things that are dumb and ridiculous but most games now-a-days are basically all unfinished games for top dollar. It is a little dumb you can smash on your front brake while your full lean and still able to have full stable contact with the ground.  Full lean on grass or sand is possible for some reason.  The biggest thing wrong this game has is the sounds of the motorcycles.  Theyre all basically generic stock muffler sound even though you straight piped your bike, and all the bikes basically run off the same sound with very very minor differences.They have Drag Racing in this game which is incredibly pointless. As long as your bike is fully upgraded you will win every time. Besides all that this game is fun as hell. I really don't understand why this game has so many down votes.  Sure there are flaws (what game is perfect?) but this game is completely playable and you hardly notice these flaws.8/10			",85,3,13,15,9,0,11

												This game is great, good graphics and great physics.Yes. this game is slow with a pretty good computer but this is the first version so we'll see.I highly recommend this to anyone whos played MotoGP, or likes motorcycle racing. Its an amazing game. Splitscreen works very well aside from the fact when near the other player the game likes to lag, but it just works great.One downside so far is changing controls for a controller doesnt work for me, game seems to crash..

												Is it perfect? No, it has issues. But I've not experienced anything game breaking, and ultimately I found RIDE incredibly enjoyable. In a world where the last ""Forza/GT but with bikes"" came out 10 years ago, you have to overlook what I feel a minor inconveniences and enjoy a rare release. Having played a lot of Milestone's previous bike games (all the way back to EA Sports Superbike 2001) probably helps, as they have made incremental improvements to what I feel is a rock solid riding model. Sure, its not GP Bikes, but there's a reason why no mainstream release has tackled simulating the weight shifting/countersteering that it takes to truly ride a bike, its an extra level of complication that would simply be a very large barrier for some people to overcome to find enjoyment. But all the right elements are there, braking points, lean angle and throttle application. A hold-trigger-to-go arcade racer its not. The knock against Milestone is they barely supported this game, with limited fixes and some incredibly content light DLC, and seemingly they are moving on to producing a sequel. So I can understand peoples' grievances in this regard for a self-published title (where a developer would usually be subjugated to the whims of a 3rd party publisher)I recommend this game with caveats; if you have a grunty system, and an affinity for bikes (or Milestones' previous bike sims). However I don't recommend getting anything more than the basic release, and if money's tight or you simply have a passing interest, wait for a sale.			",42,12,15,5,9,1,3

												Yeah, I like this game. It reminds me of Tourist Trophy (PS2) but, dare I say, with less motorcycles. I would like to see some of the bigger bikes in a DLC, for example the Honda Blackbird, the Suzuki Hayabusa and the Kawasaki ZX1400. Maybe even some classic 6 cylinders! Some motards / super motards would also be great fun. Overall, this is a fun game with superb graphics. The modding options are impressive as well - you are able to change quite a few parts on your motorcycle, and your rider can be largely customized as well. Tracks are ample, the only downside is that the vehicle list needs to be expanded. A great effort, well worth playing it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There are bad sides as well like frame drops in certain parts of the track, and min. specs are too high for a motorcycle game.My specs;Intel core i3-3217U @ 1.80 GHz (4 CPUs)4 GB RamNvidia GeForce GT 635MYa see, i dont have even maybe half of the min. specs but i still gain my hours with this game because it is that enjoyable. but again, if you want a near-perfect motorcycle game you'll just have to skip this one.

												Here is my ratings with a summary of each:Graphics 7.5/10 PROS: BIKES are b-e-a-utiful and the motorbike gear great especially the helmet visor. Cons: Pretty much everything other than the bike/rider/gear, the enviromnent is pretty poor with a total lack of atmosphere due to the substandard graphics of the crowd, track and lighting. This makes the game feel like more of a showcase than a racing game.Gameplay 6.4/10Pros: The ability to use an ""in helmet view"" is awesome as well as the settings to change the ""physics"" of the bike (easy, medium and hard to be put simply). The amount of customization for both the bike and rider is decent with a hint of riding personalisation that comes with the ""stance"" of your rider that can be customised in the settings.Cons: CONTROLLER SUPPORT. The deadzone for controllers is rediculously small. Yet again its another bike game where the movement of the bike does NOT fit in with the movement of the stick sitting on your thumb. The AI is boring to play against almost like exact copies of each other with no variation in riding styles. The online system to sign up is confusing and I actually had to go into the forums to work out how to play online (Next gen?). There is much more but tbh I cannot be bothered writting it. I love motorbikes and have been a rider since I was a kid, razed by a family or riders. So if you love bikes you might enjoy this game for that reason. But if bikes are not your passion and you just want a racing game. Don't waist your money here :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'd recommend the game because when it works, it's great. HOWEVER, there is a major bug in this game that you should watch out for. Corrupted save games. ****MAKE BACKUP'S OF YOUR SAVEGAME.**** ( default location C:\Users\*****\AppData\Roaming\Milestone\Ride\Saves)Now, about the game and gameplay:I play on max graphics with a controller and fom 1st person view, and it's great. It feels fast, it feels smooth, it feels, well, realistic. Keep in mind it's not realy a simulator, but you can get pretty close to it.The graphics are good, as long as you don't stand still. (who stands still in a race game anyway??...) The bike models and textures look amazing. The surroundings when you're racing aren't that detailed, and look more like they belong in a 2006 game, than in a 2015 game. However, when you're shooting by at 200+km/h, combined with the motion blur, I personally never realy got bothered by it. Eyes on the road, not the flowers right?Oh, and have a compilation, race and some (read: a whole truckload of) screenshots .

												Had to buy this one being an motorcyclist and wanting support games, which are rare to find about them. Generally speaking it's ok to good game, but it definitely has it's flaws. First is graphics. They do look good ingame, but optimization is quite poor, because it really isn't that ""special"" looking game. Also very rushed feel comes from ie. loading screens with are hilariously poor looking compared to other parts of game. Gameplay wise it's mixed bag. I was expecting it to be more simulation as I recall very old SuperBike games from Miles being (they were excellent). This is however isn't luckily build with completely arcade feel. But I started with ""simulation"" settings with first class bikes and where struggling to get races through at the beginning as races felt quite hard for me. Then managed to finish this class I could buy one of the most fastest bikes in game, tune it pretty much and it was very big surprise as races in this superbike class felt dirt easy if player has even slight control of gas.Oh yeah, and being enthusiast aimed game. WHERE THE HELL IS IOMTT?!? I would give this 9/10 IF it would include IOMTT track. With out it I'll give RIDE and solid 7/10Please, please add IOM track as and DLC. I though I'd never say that, but I'll buy it immediately :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""The hardest tracks are ones you most lack confidence and the easiest are ones you are most confident/comfortable with. Because when you lack confidence you tend to go slower but if you're comfortable you go full out because you know how to handle the track. You don't hold back since you're not afraid of crashing and all the adrenaline/excitement rushes in because you can go full out. You dominate the race and are ahead of everyone else. Yet, you get the feeling that you want to 'overtake' every section of the track itself. It's no longer about beating the competition, you're the competition"" -Me on Ride gameplay.I was foreign to the world of motorbikes because I never able appreciated riding one. I played one of the first motogp game in around 2000 and I loved the game very much though. Recently, I tried Milestone's MotoGP14 and despite the lack of support for the game I loved it! I still think riding a motobike is a dangerous and risky business but I can appreciate the thrill and freedom of bike riding.All this brought me to RIDE. I almost passed on buying until I saw a youtube video clip showing a tuned bike excellently ridden.Now that I have tried RIDE, I want to share my opinion of the game to help you decide. Overall, the game is good especially if you're a motorbike lover. However, it still lacks tracks to race in in my opinion. The game forces you to start with one of 3 naked bikes and I thought it was rather uncool to force you to start with a specific type of bike. That being said, the progression until you buy a new bike that you like is quick and I now have realized that naked bikes aren't that bad actually.The game allows you to buy parts for your bikes from aesthetic parts to performance enhancing ones. It also allows you to customize your rider avatar's face and gears (apparel) as well.The game feels easy to play even with pro physics and no assists especially if you compare it to MotoGP 14. It could be because the bikes are slower than those in MotoGP. But this brought a more arcade feeling to the game than Milestone's MotoGP 14.Other than the lack of tracks the only other gripe I have is the inability to select the number of laps in any race we participate in (with the exception of online games).Do note that there's no weather in game neither is day/night setting. I think every track is set to certain pre-programmed time setting. Milestone has a habit of giving you just good enough game without trying to make it really superb.Online is enjoyable too with stangers or even more with friends.UPDATE 2 APRIL 2015Now that I have spent more on the game I have more to share.The difficulty of the game increases as you upgrade from lower powered bikes to higher ones. Riding a supersport bike may be too easy compared to riding a motoGP bike in Milestone's other game but riding a modern superbike is not so easy. In fact it can feel a bit too difficult. That is until you adapt to the changes.Wheelie and stoppie happen a lot when you ride a bike with respectable horsepower unless you turn anti wheelie option to full (modern bikes have that tech actually!). Wheelie forces you to go easy on the throttle thus slowing you down despite  the bike's increased power rating. Opening up on the throttle aggresively will slow you down as your bike performs unintended wheelies. Furthermore, the game has its fair share of bugs and performance issues. Custom bike settings are not remembered forcing you to load your bike setting before every race which is annoying.Stutters can happen if you set the VRAM to auto which is the default setting.The game crashes to desktop when you try to  exit and sometimes when loading it just freezes although the likely occurence of the later is not that high.Perhaps one of the most annoying bug is that rewind doesn't always work and when it doesn't it costs you the race thus in-game money, prestige and REAL free timeUPDATE 3 April 2015Just want to add that many people mention the sounds of the bikes are not that good but to me ithey are decent enough. When you use helmet view, sounds are muffled a bit which is very nice and thoughful. You could also hear the whizzing of air past you....which is also muffled if you're in helmet view. Each bike sounds distinct enough although you can't quite immerse yourself in the feeling of raw power when hearing your engine purring and roaring as you race. But the sounds are decent enough.One of the best things in Ride is the inclusion of older bikes. These are a thrill to ride and race. You get to understand the advancement in motorbike technology as you try bikes from different eras. Most of the older bikes are from the mid 1990s and all throughout the first decade of the 21st century. Bike lovers will understand that they are riding not to show off or to indulge their prestige/ego by riding an expensive sport bike but for the enjoyment and thrill of riding it. Thus, being able to race these older bikes is awesome.Overall, this is a fun game and that's all that matters. Yes it is easier than Milestone's previous MotoGP 14 game but it's way more fun.UPDATE MULTIPLAYERThe multiplayer part is a blast in this game. It's made in such a way that your own riding is not affected by the ping response to the host. Your fellow players may rubber band if you have bad ping to the host but your experience of the race is flawless. This made it such that your result is almost not affected by the quality of your ping to the host's pc.It's a lot of fun playing with other people. And way safer too. ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Being a motorcycle enthusiast, it would take alot for me to not like this game. (given the lack of good motorcycle racing games out currently)  That being said it is a very fun and realistic racing game much like moto gp 14.  But the thing that really gives the game the edge is the variety of motorcycles and the customization. I hope they continue to support and add new content to the game unlike moto gp 14.

												It's odd of all the bad review, i've had none of the shutter problems or game deletion. I actually own a ride a BMW S1000rr and when i first picked up the controller and had a go at it, I was like this doesn't handle anything like a bike. Until I actually took the time to really learn the controls, then it all set it. Push hard to the side and you drop the bike hard into the corner like a real bike, I do beleive you have to take off the braking assist and TC to medium to get any good feel from the bike . If you do this you should really enjoy the game, the Brake assist breaks to much before a corner and while you are comming out of a corner. Try this game if you love bikes its a hoot.

												Great game!All the bikes I have had in real life so far I can ride again in this fantastic racing game.Good physics and controls. I do recommend a controller like X-Box, that works really well.Graphics are good and the bikes look like the real ones.Sound could be a bit better, but that doesn't do anything negative to the fun I have with this game.In order to be successful, you need to find a good line and be precise on the throttle.I have read some negative reviews here with some people having performance problems. I haven't found any game breaking ones so far. Some tracks do have a little lag while curving 90 degrees and more, but it is not so bad that it would really matter.I highly recommend this game to any biker out there! Thumbs up!!!

												My new rule is any game that involves jumping through firey hoops to get working automatically gets a bad review. This is one of those such cases. Kinda like GTA IV.There really are no excuses. There's hundreds of games that come out all the time that work fine on all types of computers... There is no reason one should have to go on a hunt for the Holy Grail just to get the framerate normal and eliminate input lag. No reason at all.The racing itself can be fun, albeit difficult. I was first turned onto this game from the PS4 demo (and should I have stuck with the console version?) then got it on here and the headache started.And once you do get it running it's got some design flaws. I don't usually complain about loading screens but why is there the need to interupt the loading screen to ask you to confirm the bike you want to ride that you already confirmed earlier, just to go back to the same loading screen for the same amount of time again? And this is on top of the other loading screen that doesn't look like a loading screen that can make one wonder if their game is frozen up.Anyway, just take a look at the reviews... Apparently there's also some save problems and other issues running rampant that haven't been fixed. This game's a mess and I would recommend avoid or stick with the console version or try a cracked version (I ain't afraid to say that in cases like this cause this is ridiculous).

												Wow what an amazing game! I ride a 2012 yzf-r6 as a weekend toy and this game is the closest I have ever played that comes close to the real thing. It can teach a lot of basic things like having a good roll on and learning to lean early into a turn, braking control and learning how to manage a wheelie. You start off wanting all the electronic assists on but end up using a RAW 2014 HP4 or YZF-R1 Race edition and feel like a Moto Gp Pro. I love this game but no where near as much as the real thing, but if you don't ride it will give you the itch like nothing I have ever played. Lol I am looking at getting a liter bike asap because I love riding the 2014 R1 in this game so much. So play this as a toy but take the MSF course and get a license for the real thing if you want the true experience.			",98,1,3,4,1,0,1

												Game have lots of potential but is not even close to some other titles for car enthusiast. Clearly they want to do something spectacular and they change mind in the middle. But as I said if some flows will be addressed, especially technical mistakes regarding to bikes, ill be happy. At the moment is fine but for rider/motorcyclist something will be missing. For example; tuning bike is ok but some models already have top suspension or wheels and there is no point to do that. There is nothing about ""riding modes"" which quite few bikes have and would be nice to have them in the game for sake of authenticity. Engine as graphics could be much better. Is nowhere near CoD or Forza and I can't set it any higher so it's not hardware problem.And sound. Sound of bikes is not even close to the real life, I understand that all of those problems can be resolved with money, so hopefuly after success of this game the sequel will be much better.

												before you read any bad reviews read this one. after playing for about 30 minutes your probably going to want to quit out of frustration from the fact that the game is hard as hell. im a play with all the assists off kinda guy and am just saying to get all of the immersion you can, its better in any game(sim) to drive in the cockpit(helmet)cam. the problem is if you are a casual gamer you will not understand this game. like alot of simulators you have to be into it.note the graphics arent assetto corsa but there not rubbish iether if you play games for just the looks go watch a race on tv there is more to a sim then looks. i suggest this game to anyone who expects to look at physics more then comparing graphics to assetto corsa....i know i cant be the only one who drives fine on hard ai with no assists. the handling and overall physics are pretty nice compared to previous 2 wheeled games, but you will still find yourself hitting other riders at great speeds and not falling, or massive high siding recoverys			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First a disclaimer of sorts. I very much like motorcycles, I try to play every bike game possible and I also ride a bike in real life. It is not possible to make a motorcycle simulator where you steer by using keyboard or pad or wheel. Seriously. That's why when I play a bike game I'm looking for good physics and good fun. And Milestone almost always delivers.The bad :* horribad optimization, my GT 560 SLI barely runs it on low in windowed 1280x720* crashes once in a while* few pants and boots selection for your rider* often you just cannot win without the best bike with the best setupThe good :* lots of pretty bikes* good selection of rider gear* bike customization* game is FUNIn short, think Gran Turismo with bikes. The physics seems ok, the bikes look very very nice and there is some short info about every single one. The environment is not top notch, but at 200kph it rarely matters.

Not buggy like Milestones other games, this ones acually works.The graphic are amazing, and the rider detail is the best Ive seen in any motorcycle game to date. The sound of the bikes could be alot deeper, dont get me wrong all the bike sounds unique but the game is lacking that deep rumble you get after upgrading to a proper exhaust.The handling of the bike feel really good although the bikes feel like they drift more then a real bike would under heavy stand up braking, but not a huge problem.I love the game, its basically Forza for motorcycles. I am hoping for more tracks in future DLC.			",134,19,10,12,17,1,6

It's every bit the game we've been waiting for and is miles better than the last attempt by any dev at making a ""Motorcycle Gran Turismo"" This is a game that needs to succeed because it's definitely making all the right moves and moving in the right direction as far as translating and showing the Riding experience as well as a PC game can portray. The bikes present are very well modelled and detailed and vary enough that their real life personalities shine through.It was 100% worth the purchase and a must own for anyone even remotely interested in 2 wheeled motorsports			",82,14,19,16,13,0,13

												TL;DR; Ride is really fun. Scratches my virtual motorcycle riding itch.Long story; the gameplay is fine, not mind blowing. Feels like a bike version of GRID, which isn't a terrible thing. Boiling the individual bike's characters down to a 0-10 scale feels misguided though. The s1000rr just is stupendously faster than most of the other bikes of it's era. That isn't really captured correctly. The actual mechanics of riding feels super correct. You wheelie / slide hammering the throttle out of corners. You lock up the front if you get on the brakes too hard into a corner. The body position feels correct. I would love more open maps / tracks. I would also love if they had the Isle of Mann course (!!).If you love bikes, definitely buy. If you like racing games, maybe buy. Try the demo first.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very entertaining and pretty game, I whish I hadn't read so many bad reviews initially, because the game itself is very decent, although there might be some minor issues, pricing of some dlc's mostly though. Also, there aren't many tracks available, but the tracks that are there are done quite well. There are a lot of variations available though, which amounts to some 20+ tracks to race. I can't say how diverse the base game is when it comes to the bikes though, because I bought the game with 2 dlc's when it was on sale, and I must say that there are plenty bikes available (however, 4 euro's for just 3 bikes is kind of expensive imho).All in all it's a good game, much to do and if you like motor race games this is certainly a title I would recommend.

												So far, I've got o say Ride hit the mark on a niche role that the MotoGP games weren't filling.Pros: -Over 100 bikes-Over 400 different paint jobs-from 390-1200cc bikes -Naked bikes/sports/supersports/superbikes/track bikes/prototypes-The actual gameplay feels smooth (when you use correct graphic settings)-Can change things like fender eliminators and mirror elminators, tires, lever colors, triple clamp colors.-Rider gear can be custumized from helmet (they even have my skin of the AGV K3), gloves, boots, suits, pants, and jackets-Riding position can be made custom, and that's really cool little feature for me personally-You can REALLY feel the difference in bikes. Went form an R6 600cc bikes to the Ducati Penigale 1199s, and it took about 5-8 races for me to actually get used to the feel of the Duc. I power wheeied up several times, hit the throttle too hard out of corners and slid out. Things I was doing that aren't always good practice (powering early out of turns, opening wide up in lower gears) were fine on the R6, but on the Duc, double the power it was very clear that I had to race much cleaner. Cons:-I feel the ""Racing Line"" they have is a tad off at times, there's definitely points where I can clearly break after it tells me to/lines that are more optimal to take wide/short. Looking at you Road America-The racing line isn't always clear on when to lean, Often times I can go early to get a jump on the apex. While other times if I turn when it wants me to I'll come up short on the turn.-The starting bikes are incredibly lopsided. I went with the 636 Monster, and it was a clear loser to the speed triple. I struggled very much to even finish on the podium with the Ducati. But when I started over, with the triple, it was a walk in the park to finish top.-I don't feel the tracks are varied enough in world tour mode. I've seen Road America, Imola, and Miami plenty of times. I've only seen Wales once, and yet to see Sierra Nevada. -I wish they did more with the salt flats track, It's a big relaxer to just drag it up, but I think they could do a little more with it. Maybe a mode where you try to beat your top speed?-Bike damage is nonexistant, I'd like to see a hardcore mode.Overall, I think Ride is shaping up to be the niche motorcycle riders, enthusiants, and race enthusiants are looking for. However, there are minor tweaks that need to be made, and some content as far as tracks go I'd love to see added (Isle of Man TT [PLEASE, even if it's just a segement of the track] , Leguna Seca, Catalunya, Mugello).For now, I'd give it an 8/10, hopefully Milestone actually sticks with this to provice patches, and new content.For $40, I'd say it's definitely a save bet for any motorcycle rider.

												So far what I can say about this the game.""Hard to learn, even harder to master""All the negativ reviews I read before buying this game haven't happend to me yet. Examples: FPS drop, long loading screens, not that much content. I totally love the game so far and as I said before I have'nt bumped in to stuff I don't like. Sure there are not many tracks but all the tracks look really nice. The details on the bikes are just gorgeous! I want later on buy myself a real bike and now that I play this game I got so much more respect for all the bikers out there. It's really difficult to control these monsters of a machine ( If all the assist are off). 1 thing I would like to add is a better photo editing. ""will edit this review later on when I have more hours""			",136,27,13,7,27,1,8

												Amazing, hom much potential is wasted with that game.The first glance is guite nice. Grafx look nice, but a closer look reveals, the background details are pretty poor. No intro video, no fancy visual efx. But, that's ok. Driving feels very good. Probably the most realistic motor bike driving expierence in a game for me so far. Compared to MotoGp15 the sounds did get a little better, at least  the cbr1000 sounds like ok and gives the player a slight feeling of having 200 Hp under your balls hammering. Unfortunately the Ducati 1199 sounds like an c64 emlation on an iphone 3. As many players mentioned before, it's all about the importance of realistic sounds, and that's what have not been taking care of with RIDE.  The game is fun though ""ok to play"" , but definately needs some polishing.The bikes look awesome. Tuning and setting is pretty cool.  The menu structure seems unfinished and buggy. No game servers or other players of online game available when I tried. No website available (Ride 2 only) Couldn't find any official info of this 1 year old game.No updates! Worth 40€? I don't know. The game could be so much better with 5 % more development.It's actual state is more like a 15 -20  Euro beta. But right now, it's still the best game on the market.Let's see, what Ride 2 Demo brings us. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You can be driving at 2 mph and bump into a guard rail and it will throw your off your bike?!?!? You basically have to complete each race with perfection in order to win.

												This has the potential for being one of the best motorcycle games period.   Unfortunatly due to poor programming/optimization the game runs choppy even on a good computer.  I have a GTX770 with an amd Phenom x4 965 black edition.  This should be plenty to run this game but even without vsync and lowered graphics to medium, it still runs choppy.  Most of the time its playable but annoying, and on  some tracks its almost unplayable.  Save your money don't buy this game.  Wait for a better team to either make a better game or take this over and fix it.  Disgusted!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			",102,6,8,13,16,1,13

												A brief analysis:- A could-have-been-better-but-not-bad list of motorcycles:  there are some emblematic bikes, such as the Yamaha YZF R1 and R6, Kawasaki Ninja, Ducati 1199, Honda Fireblade and others, along with some older models like the FZR750R, but the list of available bikes feels somewhat incomplete, especially when compared to Tourist Trophy, which boasted a much more varied list of available vehicles;- On the other hand, RIDE has got a good selection of tracks, with plenty of challenging tracks and well-modeled environments. There are some courses that may be familiar to most racing game aficionados, like Donington Park and Imola, along with original tracks;- Gameplay is OK. Handling feels realistic (and becomes really unforgiving with riding aids turned off), the bikes have a good response to input (some of the more powerful motorcycles may be tricky to control), and there are different camera angles to choose from (dashboard view's the best for riding, in my opinion). However, framerate is very unstable (and too laggy when the screen's crowded; it sometimes gets to a point where this problem actually has the potential of ruining your races) and, sadly, it never reaches the oft-desired 60 frames per second.- Sound is great. The bikes sound like their real-life counterparts, and the ambient sound is also OK. Soundtrack is forgettable, but not bad.Need some high-speed two-wheeled action? RIDE may be the game you're looking for. It has the potential to be onde of the best riding games available once you learn to deal with failures, but it definitely feels like something is missing. If you prefer a wider variety of tracks and vehicles, you should stick with Tourst Trophy instead. - 8/10			",119,7,30,6,7,0,8

But the funny thing is they shudve patched it months ago.If you like bikes, no not like them louve them then i stronfly advise to buy the game coz theres no other bike racing games that have this beatiful graphics and tons of bikes.But after a few races you can buy anykind of bikes so the progression just feels empty after that.My problem is the lack of street circuits.Or open worlded freerides. I would love to take my ride to a spin on the streets.Nonetheless its a moderately good game, with a few different racing features.My favourite is when you duel with another racer among other casuals.That was the most fun that i had in the game.

												Alright.. this game is good, but only if you can get it for a cheaper price, I got it for £15 during the summer sale. At it's current price it really isnt worth it.Good points:- You can feel the weight of the bikes- Great customization- Good amount of makes of models of bikes in the game- Tracks are good- Plenty of races to do over the World Tour with all the different types of bikes- Lots of fun to just go and do wheelies and stunt with the bikes Bad points:- From what I've seen from other reviews, seems to be a problem with file loss, not had this problem YET- Not very well optimised for lower end PCs (Seems to work well on mine w/ GTX 760, AMD FX-4350, 8GB RAM)- Does suffer from some random FPS drops here and there, not been a massive problem for me though- AI is a bit hit and miss, some times there really easy to beat, other times it's like you are racing Valentino Rossi.. (might just be my bad driving though)Overall this game is a lot of fun for any keen motorcyclists, probably one of the best motorbike games I've played, only buy this game if you can get it for a cheaper price as I mentioned before ",138,6,13,9,18,2,13

												Gotta give it to Milestone on this one, this game really hits the fun factor. tons of bikes, not just new but classics too. the physics,graphics,general feel of the game and layout is really satisfying and its guaranteed to please any fellow biker out there. The graphics are absolutely awesome  regarding bike models and ground textures, the enviroment outside the course itself tho is somewhat to be desired, but you buy a bike racing game to race bikes not to look at people in a crowd or a pretty little house. (i have a 4gb card so can use the 4gb textures).The detailed customisation is brilliant too, you can even edit your riding stance completely, change elbow pitch,knee stretch etc.so far i have no complaints and am really enjoying this game. really love all the customisation and it features drag racing which is also awesome!  I certainly hope Milestone use this new approach to MXGP. big thumbs up here Milestone. The user interface however needs to display xbox overlay when you have the controller connected. I recommend this game defo. i just hope Milestone actually continue to update the game tho rather than ALL there previous titles! :) ignore the hater reviews. Just peoplethay don't know how to set their gfx settings properly for milestone games or people that hate milestone and criticise life. The physics are fine when you turn assists off and handle just like the moto gp games. My only gripe is the Xbox overlay not present and lack of clutch! I paid £18 for this tho on   k I n g u I n.netMy rig:I5 4690kMSI GTX 770 4GB16GB RAMIf you struggle with FPS and have an Nvidia card then i can give you my ""Milestone Preset"" which works perfect at 60fps.

												As someone who rides a motorcycle in reality yet can't ride anything bigger than 125cc due to some stupid British law, I figured buying this game would somewhat alleviate the desire for more speed, and it has. Not entirely but to some degree it has. In terms of gameplay this game is fantastic, going round corners at god knows what speed looks and feels awesome, the physics seem lifelike (from what I can tell), and it is genuinely challenging if you turn up the AI difficulty and turn the assists off. Racing in this game is by far the best fun I've had in a video game this year. The only thing that's bad about the gameplay is the godawful engine sounds. The Aprillia RS250 sounds like the various speeds on a marital aid as you go up through the revs, the Suzuki GSXR1000 K5 sounds muffled, as if you've got your ears plugged and all of the V-Twin Ducati's just sound boring. One of the most significant things about a motorcycle is that they resemble what hell would sound like, not what a hairdryer sounds like. Aside's from the barely viable engine sounds, the gameplay is fantastic.The menu's however are not. Sure, the backgrounds are pretty, but the text and text boxes are just bland. Navigating the menu's is like trying to force spaghetti up a cat's backside. I have spent a good 3 out of my current 16.7 hours playing this game sidescrolling left and right, be it trying to choose/upgrade a bike, pick an event or simply change my character's helmet. However, ironically, when you're about to purchase yourself a new motorcycle and you go to pick a manufacturer to choose from, all of said manufacturer's are laid out in a nice, easy to navigate grid menu, yet once you pick your desired motorcycle manufacturer you go back to the slow, dimwitted sidescrolling mess that they call a  menu, it's like being stuck in a world of Soup with only a fork. Why is that simple, easy to use grid menu not implemented in ANY OF THE OTHER MENU'S? So in conclusion, if you manage to make it through the seven levels of menu hell and start a race, you will enjoy yourself. Hopefully they'll improve the engine sounds because right now they barely resemble anything that combusts. TL:DRGameplay is good, apart from the poor engine sounds.Menus are difficult to navigate and as aesthetically pleasing as a small bowl of vomit balanced on Emma Watson's nose.			",25,1,5,2,9,0,10

												Biggest waste of money ever, the game feels horrible, runs horribly even on a 980, crappy graphics even when maxxed out, had to press enter 12 times to start a race, then I couldn't even start the race because some stupid bug meant it stayed on the pause screen, pressing escape or enter on ""resume"" only unpaused the game for half a second before the pause menu came back up... couldn't even do a single world tour race, awful game full of bugs which means you can't even play it, unplayable, absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥.

												Very nice graphics, no crashing and fix the stutters easy just by turning off high res textures, looks the same. Has very realistic handling of bikes, loads and loads of tracks and bikes, and all bikes have loads of upgrades. Physics are great, sand will jacknife you, and grass will make you slide. Tracks cover GP racing tracks like Magny cours for example, drag racing strips like Salt Lake, and Country roads tracks. Best Motorbike game i have ever played. Got it on sale, very happy with it. Deserves much better recomendations imho, based on how well it plays on my old pc. 4gb ram, AMD FX4100 3.6 quad, GTX 460 SOC 1GB.			",103,5,24,11,39,0,27

												Despite all the negative reviews, I decided to give this a try..and boy, how wrong these reviews are is incredible! When it comes to the bike models, the level of details and customization, it is a masterpiece. You will spend 80% of the first race just looking at your bike and be impressed, they look awesome! The bikers customization is also on par with many options and gear to choose from. The sounds though..might use some improvements, but they are not as bad to force you stop playing. The ingame options are limited to sound and hud, the rest is either managed by your GPU's control panel or the game's launcher. Overall it is an ARCADE, don't expect super physics, feedback from the tires or anything that could make it feel more realistic or sim-like, it is 100% arcade. They clearly spent all the money on the licenses and the amazingly good looking models and left the gameplay and overall feels somwhere..far from the game xD. I will list the things you will read the most in the negative reviews and try to explain/solve them if possible:FPS drops - Yes, the drops were there when no fps lock was in place, from 120 to 80 on different areas on the same track. As this game is a console port you can't expect it to work over 60 fps without drops. Lock to 60 using your GPU's control panel and you will be fine. It NEVER dropped below 60 for me. Long loading times - Lies. Got the OS on SSD and the game running from a 5900 rpms HDD and it takes like 15 seconds, sometimes less, to start racing. Corrupt saves - As simple as backing up your save after each session. Yes, it is a pain in the ♥♥♥, but if you are a bike nurrrrd and like the game, you won't have any problems with doing a simple copy-paste. Game keeps running in the background. Close Logitech's Profiler and problem solved.Crash on loading screen. Don't press any buttons at all during loading screens and voila, no crashes. Bad AI. I agree, to a certain point. The AI is not bad, it can be a real challenge, specially at the beginning, even more if you go with the Yamaha as your first bike, but from time to time they might act like you are not there, crash into you and force you to either finish in the last positions or restart. It is annoying, yes, but, you can simply avoid them by keeping your distance or using the rewind thingy to go back in time. Xbox controller not working. I am guessing these people were using third party ""xbox"" controllers and they did not work because the original one from MS works pefectly fine. In menus and in races. For 9.99 € it is worth every cent. ",188,8,10,10,13,1,7

[edit- ran the game on a 4770k @ 4.4ghz with a 980. no fps inprovement. same issues, multiple CTD's)graphics are OK. looks like, Gran turismo 5 but with far less detailed landscapes and tracks... bikes look good. sound like they are from gran turismo....without the backfires though, seriously.""pimp your bike"" want to change the colour of your bike, well you can but it's from a select few liverys. customisation is limited...take off you mirrors, numberplate, change your wheels, colored front brake lines...gta san andreas had a better range.racing is fun, all the tracks are baby butt smooth.. no bumps.. not even rumble strips. this is not a simulator. ai might  jsut aswell be moving roadblocks, they don't give a damn about anything.hardly any bikes really...... no cafe racers, no motards etc...to sum  up..forza 1, on 2 wheels, portrted to pc, with hell expensive dlc.. (3 bikes for $5usd? holy crap...)devs could fix the game easy but they don't appear to listen to feedback or open up mod support.racing is fun, game is addicive if you are usualy the competitive sort with racing games.online race lobby search could really use some more information on where the servers are located and a ping shown as a number, it's pretty fustrating connecting to a server with 3 seconds left till race, then you find out you have a ping of 400 to the other client. .. 4/10buy if it's $20-25if your a biker, and you really want to ride virtual bikes.. this is almost as good as it gets unfortuantly. this game has huge potential but the devloper/publisher don't have a good record in customer satisfaction so don't get your hopes up.-nothing wrong with my pc or my internet. please do not comment with ""amd is ♥♥♥♥ cunt"" all you are proving is that you're a compete philistine. tested on both amd and nvidia gpu'sboth have issues. seems to suffer from alot of memory errors and these- 0x402e0d13 @ 0x00000058i will edit this review as the game is patched and updated. currently it's the first full stable release. feels very much like a beta.

												Poorly optimised.  I can run anything on max settings, this on max seems to stutter.  Several races have been forfeit due to the game stuttering and coming back already having wrecked.

												I don't know what the other reviewers were playing but it wasn't this game, it's terrible.Graphics - ok for a console game. I had all settings maxed out and it is very poor in comparison to something like Assetto Corsa. Bike models are obviously where most of the time was spent but everything else, rider, track, trackside objects all look like something from 10 years back. Poor textures no matter how high you set them.Controls - very bad, weight shifting doesn't seem to do anything, no popping wheelies with ease on this game. Holding a button to 'tuck in' seems at odds with the separate controls for weight shifting, surely this is the same as placing your weight over the front wheel?UI - No gamepad overlay, picky but standard in almost every game released these days.I would not waste your money.

												Wow, what a game! -8/1010 hours playedMotorcycle owner/fan*MUST BE PLAYED WITH A CONTROLLER*- I can not emphasize this enough There is no way to get the accuracy and finesse required out of a keyboard(at least using the most realistic physics). With a controller not only can you modulate the gas, brakes, and turning angle in a fluid way (which is extremely important to get a clean line), but you also get force feedback-which adds to the experience immensley. Every shift has a little rumble to it, you can feel when your tires are reaching/passing their grip threshold, and it's much easier to tell when you're close to the wall/another rider. I would not bother playing this game without one.PROTIP FOR NEXT GAME- VR/steam controller native suppourt would be amazing.Pros:-Good graphics, Excellent detail in all of the bike models, all the way down to the proper speedo/tach layout.-The tracks are fun and challenging, once again a lot of work went into making sure everything felt real, right down to the skidmarks on the road. Additional tracks would be nice, even as dlc(pikes peak pls). The crowds are your standard racing game low detail model but that really isn't why one plays the game.-A decent amount of character customization and an excellent amount of riding style customization. I was amazed when I figured out how tweakable this was.-The reverse function is super helpful when having issues with a certain corner. It allows you to reverse approximately the last 15 seconds and even change cameral angles to figure out exactly what the issue is. This feature should be in every racing game-The first person perspective inside the helmet is very involving. The sensation of speed has been translated very well to a video game, even including accurate sounding wind buffeting, blurring of vision and helmet shaking.-The mechanics, for the most part, are faithfully accurate to motorcycling. Using the brakes properly has been the hardest thing for me to figure out but I am starting to get it. *Big asterisk* There is no clutch control, which, while really only needed for starting, still removes a major component of a race, especially in drag races. This would be an awesome addition to subsequent games.-Extensive motorcycle roster--includes basically every major production superbike and naked bike from 2015 - INCLUDING THE MOTHERF***ING LIGHTNING 218 OMGGGGGG. All bikes have all the main customization options that are normally changed. I wish the was a bit more variety of options in a few areas, namely tires and rims but that really isn't an issue.-A decent amount of bike setup customization including, preload, spring stiffness, and preload with the top tier suspension, and full gearbox ratio customization with the top tier gearbox. *Things to add* Steering angle, more levels of gearbox and suspension customization, rear swingarm length, steering dampener settings, ecu timing and fueling, new throttle profiles, and EXTREMELY IMPORTANTLY, the ability to change settings on the fly to feel the difference and make it easier to experiment with different setups to find what works for you. It's annoying to have to go through three loading screens everytime you want to make an adjustment. A dyno would be nice too.Cons, and there are a few big ones:-THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME--Bike sound. While the sounds of different bikes vary appropriately according to displacment, engine arrangement, and exhaust, it's very obvious that not much money was put toward making the bikes sound real. When you're making a game with the sole intent of creating the most accurate bike simulator out there, this is hugely important. Does it do the job? Yes, I can shift at the proper time based on the sound. Does it add to the experience? NO. It most definitely removes from it. All the bikes have this wierd low quality synthesizer-esque sound that is just bad. I almost didn't buy the game because of this. The exhaust and intake systems should also have a more realistic effect on the overall sound. -Controller integration, while superb with actual gameplay, does not properly transfer to the replay and picture taking functions. There is no way for me to save screenshots, which might be an issue with keyboards as well. Many of the main and contextual menus do not properly display controller buttons. Also, RB is reserved for the chat function which I'm sure most people will not be using--especially in the MIDDLE OF A RACE. Complete absurdity.-No way to practice on a track in career mode-just an extra hassle and a few loading screens to switch to time trial but nevertheless annoying for something that is so essential to the game.-No real sense of career progression at least in this point in the game. It feels like there's just a bunch of tracks that I will eventually win. The player should start out in low stakes, low displacement, public, ametur races and have to work their way up to the big leagues. The amount of money you get from even the lowest tier career mode races is enough to buy a new bike every 2-3 races. While it's nice to have access to the coolest bikes right from the get go it cheapens their value. All bikes should be available outside of career mode, but you should really have to work to earn them inside it.-Mirrors do not functionAdditional ways for the game to be improved:-More extensive career mode. Sponsorship, factory and private teams, custom works parts, rivalries, greater acceptance of non-podium spots(to encourage playing on harder modes), qualifying, no restarts on official races(although I feel the rewind function to be neccesary to deal with the random crap that comes with the fact that this is a simulation and not real life), better integration of team members, multiple seasons, and more varied lengths of races are some ways to improve this.-Tire, brake pad, slider, and chain wear would all be nice to see in addition to the already existing need to replace oil every few races (which is a nice touch)-More bike customization options. Super/Turbocharging, Fuel injection system hardware, High-compression heads and forged pistons and cranks, different camshaft profiles, frame sliders, and more Colour options. Only being allowed to use the factory available colours is pretty crappy.-Easier to navigate menus. Mostly evident in the bike customization menu, categories with many colour options are all one massive list. The different styles should be listed independently of colour selection.-A drafting element-A NFSU2 style free roam would be neatTL;DRA good game provided you can get past the sound. A lot of attention to detail even though this game doesn't seem to have been made on a large budget. Mechanics are good but must be played with a controller. If you like motorcycles and video games, buy it.  ",38,4,3,1,1,0,1

												Maybe I came to this game way late, but it seems to work well for me, aside from the occasional slugishness. I'm not on a super high end system, either; 2x660TI on a i5 3550. I play with a 360 controller and it works pretty well, much better than a mouse and keyboard. As for the riding, it's a lot of fun.

												I have played this game for many hours now and I intend to carry on playing it, it does have its fair share of issues, such as frame rate dropping when trying to have a quick look behind you, also twice now my save data, (just ranking progress) has become corrupted, but all my profile and bike data has stayed, which meant just starting from the bottom again, just another excuse to keep playing for me, i enjoy the hell out of this game, but if the issues are going to bother you, then stay away, i only bought it because it was 50% off in the steam sale, i probably wouldn't pay full price for it.hopefully Milestone will release a patch at some point and sort some of the issues out, but I don't see it happening anytime soon, some new DLC would be nice too, maybe the Isle of Man TT course or Southern 100, or NW200, or the likes.

												The most disappointing game I've ever played..I'm a huge fan of motorcycles, and so I was REALLY looking forward to this game...But, as everything Milestone does, it could have been a marvelous game, but in the end it sucks!Framerate problems that make the game unplayable, engine sound of 85% of the bikes unrealistic, racing categories badly organized (in every category, there is the bike that you win everything with and the one taht you lose everything with), and personalization of the bike not so perfect as Milestone would want us to think..Don't buy it..

												Excellent expanding selection of current and historic sportbikes, attention to detail, managable learning curve, bike modifications, realistic tracks, good core game.Overshadowed by stacked loading screens, game breaking exit-game issues, championship crashing, multiplayer ending bugs. Obvious quick port to PC. No social modules for chat, or user interface for mouse selections.This one is a gem that needed more time being cut.With hardly any competition in the 2 wheel market, a polished version of this might have cornered the whole niche.Recommending with a large dose of ""It's far from perfect, but it has good potential.""

So game can be adjusted between simulation and acrade.I'm very pleased that game features different types of bikes. I love sport bikes, but it's fun to try make decent laptimes  with e.g. XJR1300 (could be nice bike for crusing, but not time attack :) I hope they add more bikes like XJR1300).I ride bikes (mostly sport / track bikes) in reali life, have lot's of experience of riding and I'm bike enthustiatic.

												There are tons of bikes to choose from, and there is so much to do to keep you busy. The bikes sound relatively the same in real life, but if you put an aftermarket can there is no difference which sucks.  The graphics are pretty good, when you get up to speed the whole screen shakes, you can hear the wind which creates a real life feel. There are an overwhelming amount of upgrades that you can do with all of the bikes. Overall I say its worth the money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												tl;dr Game doesn't have any technical issues for me (though I advise doing your own research first), bikes are absolutely beautiful and a joy to ride. Get it if you're a motorcycle fan.Full review: Doesn't honestly deserve the flak it gets. Encountered no save game issues, and the game runs buttery smooth on my rig. The bikes are beautifully modelled and rendered, and the engines sound fantastic on headphones. The tracks pass by fast enough while I'm riding that the supposed lower quality details do not stand out at all. Riders are believable and very well animated, and the amount of control finesse you can get over the bike is huge, from extremely hand-holdy assistance to letting you have full control over the brakes individually, and shifting gears manually.The attention to detail is appreciable especially in the first person helmet view available, it even muffles the engine sound, simulating wearing a full-face helmet. Though no game can really ever come close to capturing the physical aspect of actually riding a motorcycle, RIDE does a respectable job of it. A solid purchase for motorcycle fanatics and riders, in my mind.			",318,68,11,29,26,3,34

												Before I purchased this on Steam I had hopelessly waited forever for this game to come out. To me it looked almost identical to Forza Motorsports for motorcycles. Kind of a simulator but designed to have arcade abilities to enable less experienced sim folk to enjoy. Well I eventually give up after a year of watching everyone else get it . Time goes on and I build a PC and sure enough here it is. I get excited and make my purchase. I am ready to delve in to deep upgrades and competitive racing enjoying the real sounding and feeling machines so I thought.   What I will complement them on is the 3rd person view and graphics in most cases seem pretty decent but it ends there. Upon starting the game for the first time I realize that the amount of options to enhance graphics or disable depending on your build was absolutely pathetic. The online doesnt work at all despite it telling you you have created a valid account. It just keeps telling me ""failed to authenticate"" which is dismal to say the least. For the sake of a short""ish"" review I will move on and not get too hung up. Now I am in the game and buy my first bike. The sound is nothing like the real thing and obviously it looks like a stock bike so I head on over to the garage to upgrade and maybe see some info on my bike. By the way the dealership completely sucks. It has no interaction or detail. Its just 5 bar stats going from 0-10 and basic specs. Well inside the parts list I realize there are only oil change, port work in two stages, two brands of exhaust (and obviously Akropovic paid the higher dollar to have their exhaust used here because their exhausts give way more power which is completely wrong in the real world) and wait for it.......... two brands of air filter. The supposive ""customize your machine"" is a load of crock also. You can change brake lines, remove fender eliminator, and pick between usually two to three factory colors for your machine. Not even a paint shop on this game its so plain and empty.  The mechanics of the game seem to be very similar to MotoGP while on the track excluding the tire slippage and spinning are lacking in a realistic way. There is no clutch option at all. The tuning is also a joke. Its pretty much a slider bar for five basic catagories of suspension and a few on and off switches for TCS . I think you are stuck in ABS on .  The boards become old quickly because there isnt many and the ones that are there are just the same things. I also noticed a stock bike on the drag strip is just as competitive as a ""completely modified"" version. Everything costs the same for each bike also. I did notice the prices of the machines are around real world price but because the game gives you money so quickly you are in a top notch machine in less than an hour and no real feeling of any campaign or point system outside of a fake ""world ranking"" they give you that basically moves up a couple spots each time you win a race. The AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and bounces off walls or you and loves to cut you off frequently.  Overall guys this game looked to be something huge so my hopes were high and I was completely let down. This felt far more like a demo or BETA than an actual game. I cant believe I paid 65$ for this. I doubt we see a Ride 2. Trust me by taking your money and going back to MotoGP and deal with no real upgrade system. At least then you get real simulation feeling and competitive racing. Overall 5 out of 10.
