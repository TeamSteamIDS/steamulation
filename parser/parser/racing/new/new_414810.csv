Early Access Review
								Observatory: A VR Variety Pack (Early Access Review)Date: 5/14/16Phantasmagoria Music VideoLength: Just under 5 minutes.I was skeptical going into the Phantasmagoria VR music video but I enjoyed it quite a lot as a piece of VR musical-visual-immersive art. I had some slowdown in some of the tunnels but I'll chalk that up to the fact that my computer is a couple years old and I'm only running a GeForce 960. The aesthetic isn't lost when you turn down the graphics so it works out in the end. Sort of reminded me of that Steven King movie Lawnmower man in a way. Hamster Slide:Length: 2-4 minutes per race. (I spent 30 minutes in there today trying to beat some of the top completion times, I could only get to 6th out of 7 recorded times but I really enjoyed myself.)I must have spent about 40 min playing hamster slide. This game is actually really addicting. (Make sure you finish the tutorial to have a competitive advantage) Right now this is my go to game for an exhilarating seated VR experience for when my legs get sore from room-scale. This is like a procedural racing game where you strategically find power-ups to increase boost capabilities and save your boosts for when your bar is maxed or when your trying to go off-track to skip portions of the track. This is where the real strategy comes into play, you can jump yourself off the track and skip portions like in most versions of Rainbow Road in Mario Kart. There ARE checkpoints, so you won't be able to skip the WHOLE track, but it allows you to get real creative in how you get from one checkpoint to another You race against ghosts of real users and the track changes daily so there is a sense of community and competition. Sort of like going to an arcade and trying to beat the high score on a game played by only a few people. I'm sure this will change as more people play but I like that there is a different leaderboard for each day. The two experiences out so far are unique and enjoyable. Well worth $10 in my opinion, and I haven't even tried the other two unfinished experiences. I'm looking forward to checking them out when they are complete, or possibly sooner!

								I liked this, but it all comes down to the last two games. Right now only two out of four things are available but if the two remaining ones are as good as the first two, i'll be happy.PhantasmagoriaThis is a do once experience, at least for me. It's pretty cool though.Hamster SlideThis is a nice game. Fast and challenging. Some motion sickness but you get used to it pretty fast. Good physics and controls.			",99,34,2,22,20,2,24

								I truly didnt know what to expect when i picked up the demo for this, i will not add any spoilers at all. However i will say one thing.. the VR experience itself is mind blowing, Phantasmagoria as a music video in a true VR enviroment is just incredible. It really is an mazing experience its my all time favorite out there so far.			",63,9,2,13,14,0,9
