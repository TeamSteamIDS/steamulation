												Reasonable arcade racer. Controls were a bit twitchy but quite playable with KB or pad and fully rebindable. Screen resolution is limited to 1080p. Surprising amount of cars. Body shop for basic paints and upgrades to your weapons, armor and cars speed. Junkyard for cheap parts, 'supply drops' happen on a timer which contained money and upgrades. NO in app purchases, all free or obtained via cash from racing. Career mode has chapters and online multiplayer option is available. Not a game you will spend weeks playing but I still think it's worth the price. + Steam Achievements please. :) Cheers.

												Android port. The menus suck because they're just ports of the android version, with no options to adjust graphics and they are not fully controller compatible (granted they only claim partial support).Gameplay works well enough with a gamepad. Start menu comes up when you press start, but wouldn't unpause with start. I had to click resume. Anyways the graphics are what you'd expect of an Android port. Late PS2/Dreamcast graphics from 2003 or something. Combat was alright. It felt tactful and impactful enough, but i just can't see myself playing this anymore. Gas Guzzlers, Split Second and Blur do this way better and are far better, deeper experiences.For a buck, sure maybe add it to your library, but objectively despite how cheap it is, i just can't recommend.

												Picked this up for the low low price of free so that's a huge plus going for this game. If you've played mobile games like Asphalt 7 or 8 then you pretty much know what to expect with this game with the added visual flair of cyberpunk avatars and city scapes. It is a bit odd playing a self driving car on the computer (and it turns out that it is on google play for mobile devices) but it really only takes a race or two to get the haing of things. The controls are a bit odd when it comes to stearing most of the time light taps are all you will ever want to do. more often than not if you hold the stick for even a second too long you'll end up plowing into a wall.All in all not a bad little time waster, but don't spend any cash on it as this is unlikely to replace any other racing game you might have.

												Good game so far, but REALLY sensitive steering. Is there a slider I'm not seeing, or is there no sensitivity option?			",79,15,10,14,27,1,7

												Nice racing game that adds weapons to the fun. For 1$ is a steal.			",151,30,23,14,11,3,43

												Not too bad for a bit of quick fun. Looks like it could get deep...or not.			",179,21,4,16,15,1,29
