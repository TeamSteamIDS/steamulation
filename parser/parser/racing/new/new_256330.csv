												Rally is my favorite form of racing/competition and gotta say I'm very surprised how good WRC4 actually is, I played WRC3 and didnt like it much, but this is a huge improvement. The driving feel is awesome, the cars react how they should. The stages are simply amazing, they can be difficult and tight but that's what I love of rally racing. Multiplayer is great fun, I can only hope it keeps a good healthy community.Comparing this to Codemasters rally titles:Handling: WRC 4Stages: WRC 4Sound: DiRT 2/3Graphics: DiRT 2/3Codemasters take the sound and graphics department by far but gameplay is definitely better in WRC 4. I'm happy the official WRC titles made it to steam, totally worth the day 1 purchase.			",237,11,34,19,11,1,25

This game is no DiRT but it stands on its own merits and with all this nonsense about GFWL breaking my copy of DiRT 2 (and being removed from steam) Showdown being rather.. not what I want. This stands as a good substitute. - Has an interesting career mode, taking contracts and such.- Persistant damage between races which I found to give a subtle and unique sense of immersion- Great audio from engine sounds to co-pilot voiceworkSomething tells me this series has more popularity in other countries. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll get back to pretending I'm not pacing around the living room in unabated anticipation waiting for a DiRT 4 annoucement.Follow my curation for more ",1041,294,48,105,93,7,96

												I would only recommend this game to people who are fans of the WRC, because let's face it, it's the latest and only official product we have in the gaming market right now based on the 2013 season. However, if I wasn't an avid fan of the WRC, I would avoid this game like the plague. The physics are almost wooden, the visuals fall way short of what a game of this age should live up to, the track design is boring, and on many stages the devs have just receycled a lot of the road sections because of the circuit (lazy) design of each event, the sounds are horrid and contained, and the whole experience is just flat. The career mode has been improved, and it's the mode I have played the most. However, if you're looking for longevity then the multiplayer won't give you much of that, because it's likely to not even work for a lot of people. You can create an account for it, but after a week, the chances are that the game will tell you that you don't have an account any more, and that you'll have to create a new one. I've created a new account 5 times now, and I got hit with the same message this morning, so no more for me. Terrible effort of a game. It may have been an acceptable effort in 2008, but not late 2013.			",106,8,20,6,12,1,23

												Is it the best rally game ever? No. Is it a decent rally game? Yes. Is it better than previous WRC games? It is, specially than ""WRC 3"" which had an insulting ""Career"" mode. This one has a proper WRC career from WRC3 (2WD) to WRC main class, is way more realistic in that department than previous ones...Car choices are limited to the WRC3, WRC2 and WRC classes, there's no GroupB this time, no classic GroupA/90's WRC and no classics. But that's not a big disappointment, because in previous WRC games their driving was not that great, and the choices/licenses were also very limited.Some of the Rallys are much improved in my opinion (Germany specially), although others are exactly the same as the previous game. Each one has six stages, but no closed loop super specials this time.One thing that still annoys quite a bit is the design of some stages, specially the ones with extremely slow and tight hairpins chained one after another. I mean, one or two of them I think I wouldn't be even able to do them in real life without backing up. And since the WRC cars have such high torque/acceleration they tend to lag a lot in 1st gear with considerable wheelspin there, it's quite annoying. I've cricticise previous WRC games (specially the first 2) for having very long turns and not much hairpins, but now it's the opposite, they are ridiculously tight and too close from each other.Gameplay: (my opinion is based on keyboard use only, with outside camera view) it's more of an arcade, this is far from a sim. That said, it's ""attack friendly"", quite arcadish and a bit to the loose/quick steering, which helps a lot to recover from near-crash situations, but it's a bit too much to feel in perfect control and sometimes it actually turns too much to the inside when you want to slide to the corners. You can adjust the steering lock a bit on the car setup though, but it doesn't solve the situation completely and it still feels a bit too fast. WRC 1 I think it had quite more precision and you could antecipate and attack against the clock with more confidence. That said, this one adds a bit more need to re-adjust and to fine tune your input, so it's more unpredictable. 2WD cars are much more nicer to drive, though, much less catastrophic understeer than before, and are much more worth the time spent on them (Career mode).Graphics: they get better with every game, but this is a console port (old gen), and not a very great one. Mediocre motion blur, occasional sluggish/stutter and fps drops kind of spoil the visual flow/pacing, and textures aren't great, since it's a simple port. I recommend using SweetFX tweak tool to make the graphics sharper and to boost the colour levels, it helps a bit.Sound: not great, but less annoying than the previous ones in my opinion (specially the Fiesta reving on red line). Biggest problem at the moment is a major bug that makes the game sound to turn off (normally after 3, 4 or 5 stages and before starting the next stage), requesting a game restart to fix it. You can still complete the rally/next stages but there's no sound at all.Other bugs: a few of them. Online doesn't work for a lot of people (doesn't connect), cinematics are bugged (half screen is black, some don't even seem to appear (after winning a championship, for example). Haven't seen much game braking invisible walls but some of the vegetation will certainly behave like a massive metal pole and destroy part the car in a heartbeat. It's not likely it will be all fixed soon and improved by the developer, considering the previous games, but fingers crossed.Details: well, the ""Career"" office looks decent but the email system is just the same every time (even when you win a rally), so it's 100% useless unless you haven't seen a single rally event in your entire life or haven't played a rally game before. One thing it has is the Service Park only every 2 stages which is nice and more close to reality. It also has Power Stage system like the real WRC. Flashbacks system is there but it's better and more fun to just avoid it and ramp up the AI difficulty level to have a decent challenge.Conclusion: It's a game with a limited budget and team, and it's clearly aimed for consoles first, PC later. So it has the usual drawbacks of a port. Does it make a better job than other rally games out there? Well, there's no other decent rally games out there that deserve your attention if you're a rally fan. And I mean proper rally / WRC, not ""gymkhana stuff"". Let's say it's a bit close to ""Colin McRae"" games back in the day, although it's debatable.That's why I do Recommend this game. It's the only proper Rally game out there and it's a game I enjoy playing even though it's not perfect. Just pick it up depending on the price you're willing to risk.			",121,21,18,8,12,4,13

												If feels like somehow a few developers who learned to code from YouTube coding lessons managed to cut and paste their way into something that resembles a game. I’ve tried to like this game for 3 months but its been a horrible experience overall. This is a mediocre game at best. Further, they insist on degrading the user experience further by forcing secondary logins & game registrations.  You have to create an account with them, verify you are who you say you are, and all that junk. This stuff never works right and is especially true with this game. Oh, and get this, you must use a gmail account for registration.  What?? I have gmail but still what kind of flaky spaghetti code are they writing that can only handle registrations from gmail? None of this has anything to do with the game either its just some kind of old school foolishness. They don’t even maintain multiplayer game servers (see below) which would at least be a valid excuse for this account registration nonsense. Aside from registering the game and perhaps being forced to do so multiple times because they have an inadequate registration system that forgets who you are and loses all of your game info you’ll have an even more difficult time trying to do anything that requires hitting their servers like saving race results and getting anything to do with multiplayer to work.  Even the achievements seem straight up bugged presumably because their own system doesn't remember who you are and refuses to pass on the achievement information to Steam.   Even the most mundane of achievements are hit or miss to ever get to pop.  Some basic achievement as simple as opening the car repair menu may never pop and likely a more significant one like a well earned victory achievement will never be realized.  Achievements are not that big of a deal but if you’re going to advertise them as a feature then you know what? They better work.All this developer imposed nonsense aside, the game itself is average for a 10 year old racing game. The graphics are lackluster but passable.  On the highest settings performance is almost decent BUT it looks so dated. The controls are fine using an XBOX wireless wheel or just a regular XBOX wireless game pad.  What is an issue, however, is once you do any remapping of controls the game menus do not properly represent your remappings. It uses the default prompts in the game even after you change the mappings. It’s also really easy to get stuck in the simplest of menus and the prompts just don’t make sense sometimes. Come on, at least get the MENU system right.  Then it’ll read something along the lines of press A for OK, B for Accept, etc.  So you have multiple options that would appear to do the same thing, but of course they don’t and good luck trying to figure out what the devs were thinking with that.  You can’t tell half of the time if you’re continuing to the next level or about to forfeit a race. Once in a while a button just stops working in the menus. You might have to abandon a race if, for example, you’re on the race stage info menu but the right dpad stops working so you cant navigate back to start the race or tune and repair your car. No other key or button will help either and you’re only choice is to quit which hurts your overall standings which in turn hurts your ability to advance in the campaign. Magically the button starts working again once you've done exactly the opposite of what you wanted to do. Sometimes the sound cuts out entirely. Not just the car sounds, but everything in the game including music, the crowd, etc. Silence. Then it’ll suddenly start working again 30 seconds later. These things have been complained about on the forums for months to no avail. I’ve never been able to start a multiplayer game.  The system insists I need to create an account and verify it which has been done.  I did it when I first started playing in November 2013 and have done it again since. Doesn't matter I don’t exist apparently.  None of my race results get uploaded and after every single stage of a single player race I face “an error occurred during upload” message.Support doesn't seem to exist.  They haven’t replied to any emails, facebook, or in the Steam forums. In fact I think some of my posts were wiped away instead of being replied to. The attitude feels like, “thanks for the cash, now leave us alone.”  Also I’d take whatever they put on the store page with a grain of salt. “78 courses in 13 different countries,” they say?  Well maybe if you count that ½ are just reversed courses or slight variations on the other courses. There are nowhere near 78 ORIGINAL courses. Also from the store page, “Online multiplayer mode for up to 16 people” but this is from their own readme: “ARC 4 FIA World Rally Championship has no dedicated servers for multiplayer.” Huh?  So it’s peer to peer? How do you even establish a peer to peer connection if you can’t even start multiplayer mode at all?There are plenty of great racing games out there with a lower price tag. This game is a bit specialized but not terribly so that its a must have. I guess I could go on about how much I don’t like this game but if you made it this far there is no sense in beating a dead horse. Even though I got it at a big discount I don’t think I’d buy it for $1 if I knew then what I know now.  Since it will be in my Steam library for eternity I guess I’ll just rage play it whenever I’m debating buying another game that I’m on the fence about to remind me to stop buying terrible games.

												I'm a huge rally fan and for me, this game ticks some boxes but is lacking in key areas.Gameplay experience is generally good, I play in the hood view and its easy to get enjoyment from the sense of speed it creates. The car set up option is also good and fairly thorough. The handling of the cars (I use a controller) is, although, a bit sloppy and I would've liked the kind of percision evident in games like the DiRT series.My biggest problem and the most frustrating thing about this game is the pace notes. If you arent very familiar with rally outside the gaming world, perhaps this wouldn't seem like a big thing. The pace notes in game are HORRIFICALLY inaccurate and vague. The developers clearly gave little thought to individual stages and instead recorded all the notes and threw them in haphazardly into the rallys with little thought. Many of the corners in game tighten and are rarely mentioned, to get out of recording specific stage notes, there is a chicane (left/right or right/left) note and a very vague Turn Left/ Turn Right junction note with no specific severity of bend. Without a course map it becomes extremely difficult to successfully navigate a stage as crests and tightening corners are never mentioned and its largely left to guess work.I could go on about the various problems with this game but the fact of the matter is if youre looking for a decent rally simulator with good gameplay, great graphics, and decent gaming experience, buy DiRT.This game has a long way to come before it can compete.

												NOTE : My play time on this game is around 100hours, but i play offline, which steam does not count, hence the low 'time playing'.I will recommend this game, HOWEVER:There are several things very much worth taking into account if you do want to buy it.1. The co-driver is terrible. Is often quite inconsistent with the labelling (i.e a left 3 can be several different angles and speeds even though all of them are in the same stage)  He will mention stuff thats irrelevant, one corner saying 'past trees' whe the tree in question is on top of an 8 foot wall, which you should also avoid but is NOT mentioned. He NEVER says anything about camber which is a little odd, he will call jumps bumps, bumps jumps and jumps as crests, with no real consistency between any of the three, and will often not mention bumps and crests that can end up with race destroying crashes.He appears to have very little idea what opens or tightens means, and will say them when not needed, and not say when he really really should have done.Rolling the car on corners that should be 'Don't cut' is quite common place, and i'm pretty sure (i've checked it twice) there is a Hairpin labelled left when its right.This can get insanely annoying after a while, when it is well known good rallying is all about good pace notes.Basically he is quite inconsistent, and you will find youself simply learning the courses by doing them, and having your own pace notes in your head for the ones he doesn't mention.There are no also no options for altering him other than timing and volume.2.The number of tracks mentioned is somewhat of a false hood, there seems to be around 3 stages for each country, that get 'combined together' into different tracks, (so the first half of one track is the last part, ot the middlle of another), and just having the reverse stage as another track (so driving the same course backwards). While the 'weather' changes, it is just a difference of colour, not sunny to raining, just midday to evening and only seems to affect lighting comditions.3. Someone else has said this aswell, this is a hairpin fest like no other, I beleive there are 2  maybe 3 courses. where the car gets to really high speeds, aside from those you will never see 5 or 6th gear. Every single course has a bucket of hairpins, and very few fast sections even in Germany, Finland, Australia and Sweden, which are kind of renowned for being very high speed events.Aside from these points the game handles quite alot better than other WRC games,  the car physics are very good and you can feel the road and behaviour of the car quite nicely.Basically this game plays quite nicley but has some not major but very irritating flaws.

												65/100 Pro:- Official championship (teams/cars)- Career- No annoying unskipable career agent nor a story mode and other nonsense- Decent enough car setup options- Decent damage applications- Decent voices and sounds (pace notes) Con:- Repetitive lazy copy&paste stages (tracks) - Some very unrealistic tracks (Mexico) with wrong pace notes to compliment it- Insane amount of hairpin corners and often way to tight- Mweh physics and car handling- Mweh graphicsI bought it @ 75% off and for that price it's an okay rally game, but just don't expect a full realistic rally sim (anno 2014 the first one still has yet to be made).Compared to very old rally games such as the Colin McRae WRC series and even the old V-Rally this modern 2013 game has little to no improvements to show for. In Fact, the tracks in Colin McRae (10 years ago) were much better and so was the car handling and feel of realism. This rally game is an uninspired game with little to no love from the developers, it's just made for the $. Anno 2013 they could have delivered so much more then the old rally games, but amost non of that is presented here. Overall it is still a fun race game and worth to spend at least a couple dozen hours on if you ignore the cheesy factors, hence it's still a thumbs up.			",148,11,15,23,22,1,29

												I feel somewhat torn about this game. On the one hand it is a competent rally game we had not since Colin McRae Rally 2005 and Richard Burns Rally. On the other hand it has some serious flaws. The game has quite arcady driving physics, and if it is good or not for you, it depends on your personal preferences. This is a proper rally game, so it does not have any Ghymkhana, rallycross or baja nonsense. It contains 4 classes (WRC, WRC 2, WRC 3 and Junior WRC) and 13 rallies with 6 special stages each.On the other hand the amount of roads is quite limited. Each rally has 6 stages, but there are driven mostly through the same pieces of road, so there are only about 2 unique special stages per rally. The fact that kept us playing old rally games was great amount of special stages and vehicles, there just is not enough of that. The game is capped to 30 frames per second, what is unacceptable for a PC driving game nowadays, but there are some methods to remove this cap. The game still has some bugs, which are not game braking, but still can be annoying for some people.The bottom line is that if you are into rally games, get it on sale. It has too much flaws to be recommended at full price, but if you can get it cheaper, it is worth playing. ",611,194,64,74,137,13,124

												I do not recommend purchasing this game unless you get it for a very cheap price and only want to play it for the career mode. The multiplayer aspect of it is well and truly broken. DO NOT depend on multiplayer working at all if you purchase, despite what the product listing will tell you. Also, the game does not have a playable framerate for a lot of people regardless of GPU, unless you turn off v-sync (this is true for my HD7970). Once you turn off the v-sync and get to playing, the career mode is okay, if you don't mind a smaller-than-usual selection of rally stages. The handling of the cars is a bit arcadey but not too bad.Altogether, a very uninspired effort, and not worth the money unless heavily discounted.			",119,21,23,7,17,3,3

												Personal Rating: Solid Rally GameClassic Rating: ★★★★☆Latest Rally Game I played on PC was Richard Burns Rally and that was a terrific Sim; other rally games I played on Playstation are the Colin McRae's Rally Series: those were mostly Arcade games and even though you cannot compare them to RBR, I enjoyed them quite a lot at the time.Now, WRC 4 FIA WORLD RALLY CHAMPIONSHIP is a very well balanced game, it cannot be defined as a Simulator but it's not even an Arcade. I'm playing with an XBOX 360 Gamepad - no wheel here - and I'm using ""Durazno"" to change acceleration/brake from left/right trigger to right stick: I can't really get used to the triggers; I also have the handbrake an ""A"" and it feels really comfortable now.This game can be played in different ways:● Fast stage: single run on a random SS with a random car● Single Stage/Rally: you can chose a single SS or a complete rally with a car you like, in the category you like● Career Mode: You get contracts from your manager, start low in the Junior Category and go up till WRC Championship● MultiplayerOne ""big"" problem I (and many other users) have is that online features (not talking about MP, because I usually play solo) is often down: the game cannot estabilish a connection to the server and you can't save progress online - yes, you need to register an account in the setup screen, before entering the game.I bought this game on a Summer Sale, even though it was quite expensive for my wallet, but I'm very satisfied and feel like I can recommend it to anybody who likes Rally races - newbies and pros.

With a steering wheel this game is a pure joy, when you can forget the fact that this game isn't perfect. If you're looking for a true rally game, I think this is the one to pick. Yet I'm still looking forward to a simulator level perfection in a rally game. + true rally game instead of some other hybrids on the market+ beautiful graphics+ easy game to start with and challenging enough on higher levels+ physics better than in an arcade, but not on the level of a simulator+ hot seat game up to 4 people with friends- steering wheel support could be better - barely any FFB - pedal adjustments are pretty horrible yet you get used to it- very few people in multiplayer due to its bugs ",46,11,17,6,4,2,17

												This game has some real issues. There are sound drops, frame rate drops and servers are offline. There are a lot of user suggested work-arounds but the main issue with this game is that it is no longer supported by the publisher/dev studio. Besides all this annoying technical stuff, the game play is quite repetitive. So either during career mode, you will drive the same tracks again or in reverse direction. Wheel support is lousy (problems with Logitech profiler, no feedback from the surface. Gravel or mud -does not feel any difference. Jumping or crashing - no feeback to the wheel. Car handling is not realistic at all. Feels mor like arcarde). I strongly recommend to go for a more up-to-date game. I will complete the achievements and then uninstall this piece of crap.

												EDIT: Now that I have been playing this game for 10h I cn bring more info to my review. Mostly I have playing in carrer mode where you start in WRC Junior category as a wild car for 2 rallies, if you show your skills you advance to WRC2 championship and then to WRC top category. at the start of every level you can choose to sign with different teams, which have different performance cars.In general, stages require very technical driving skills, it is not simply push full gas, there are alot of brake and handbrake use, and some important jumps. Narrow roads were you need to be carefull not to fall on a ditch. I only reached top speed on Montecarlo and Finland.The only feature I would like to see is night stages, or more dynamic weather.---------------------------I've been playing this game for an hour, I was curious about it but due to some negative reviews I wait until I was sure. Finally I bought it last weekend in a sale and it hooked me sonce the 1st stage.I think is one of the best rally games I have played in years since my PS1 days, I have played Dirt but it never hooked me, it was good but I felt it like an arcade more than a simulator. In WRC4 I felt a great change, an licensed FIA WRC game with the official 2013 season and drivers list, WRC schedule and several car settings. A very accurate copilot comunication and real damages.Since the first minutes of the game I felt like I was playing Colin Mcrae Rally 2.0 from my PS1 days, but not in terms of graphics, but in terms of gameplay, it had that exceptional rally atmosphere I remember from when I was a kid in front of the tv. Graphically I can't complain, I play in a laptop with intel hd4000 and even in low/medium settings looks great, but as I said previously the best part is gameplay.			",51,6,5,1,2,1,4

												I strongly do not reccomend this game because I have every problem ever with this game. I contacted the developers about these problems, and they did help, so the devs aren't bad. The game they made is bad, becuase the sound breaks after every round, the loading screens don't end, and there isn't much steering wheel support. All of this happened to me, so others may not get these problems, but some things like the sound breaking, I know others have too. The rally aspect, and the game itself when you actually get to play is fun! There is a career mode and different cars, stages, decent areas and everything a rally game like this will ever need. But there isnt much playing, more just restarting the game, on hopes it will work next time.			",51,0,7,3,5,0,0

												In short: It's just too lazily done to recommend.So far I've driven 5 rallyes in the championship, out of which at least 3 are definitely just copied directly from WRC 3. I'll leave Sweden on ""maybe, maybe not"" category, but it does look awfully similar than the last one. Germany was the only one which seemed to have changed, although I'm not sure if it was for the better. The faster speed of the old one fit better.The game also looks surprisingly bad. It somehow looks even worse than WRC 3. It's a shame, since WRC 3 showed some potential and with a bit better graphics it could have been one of the top rallying games.One of the biggest issues is the pace notes. Which leave a lot to be desired. Sometimes they are late, sometimes they come too soon. The pacing is bad, some corners have totally derpy notes. hand brake on a ""crossing"", that would equal to a 5 level of difficulty, some corners noted 2 levels wrong in difficulty, some totally omitted from notation. And then the notes sometimes just disappear from the screen...I haven't driven the proper 4wd cars, since I'm still in WRC3 so I can't say if the physics and drivability have changed, but based on WRC3, that side should be pretty good. And I haven't driven Greece yet, but if they haven't changed that one, that's a set of some of the best rallying stages I've driven in games.			",426,196,22,49,73,3,55

												Not worth the price, especially if you already own WRC3.This game has no wheel forcefeedback, cute but ultra heavy graphics (on my HD7850 there's almost no way to avoid stuttering, and dynamic vsync is not sufficient to play fluently, especially in Sweden tracks and in every place with many spectators or buildings).Multiplayer never worked, and the game mocks me with a message shown everytime the game tries, without success, to upload my race times - which is, every time I race.It's a pity, handling and sounds are improved from WRC3, but those are the only things better in this 40€ standalone dlc.And while many Steam users are complaining about poor performances, even on powerful pcs, Milestone is silent.AVOID, or wait for a truly good patch, at least.If ever there will be one.

												Still playing it, almost a year after release.For me, the graphics look good and the sound is authentic. There's no silly challenges, just simple honest to goodness rally racing.It's no Richard Burns Rally but it defintely picks up where the Colin Mcrae games left off. Dirt was good but went in another direction entirely. This is good fun and challenging. Along with Insane 2 (which is a bit like a quick and dirty copy of motorstorm) are are my two favourite racers.You can pick up and play for 5 minutes or easily spend an hour or so enjoying some finger twitching rally fun.

												I would say don't buy this unless you're a hardcore rally fan and NEED a new rally game. Which I was at the time I bought this, but there's no need to buy this now that DiRT Rally is out.It's realistic enough, but there's a critical glitch that makes the sound cut out if you're using a G27. And support has been completely abandoned. There's no way to patch it. You'll finish a stage and load the next and you'll have no sound.I can't recommend this game at all anymore.

												i regreted buying this but thankfully humble store accepted my refund request.From someone who plays DIRT, this game is HORRIBLE. the only thing that goes for this game is that it has official licensing  from WRC. Car handling and physics is horrible.Very poor support for steering wheels, even popular midrange wheel like my Logitech MOMO racing wheel does not work well at all.Overall poorly made game(seriously dont understand how developer like Milestone who makes only racing games can end up making such a bad game)Best advice is to play Dirt 3 complete editon until DIRT 4 comes out.

												Before you start looking my review being stinky and unfair because I only played 2 hours, it's because I already have 50+ hours on PS Vita cause there's where this game was intended for, so let's begin.Pros+ Very nice graphics for a game that's a port from consoles. Kudos to Autodesk Beast.+ Very easy career to folow: Win the 6 Special Stages and ascend in the rangings. Easy, simple and effective to achieve fun.+ Not powerhouse PC requiremends in order to play. Good for people with mid-range PCs who want 1080p resolution.+ Good variety of cars to choose while you unlock better rep.+ Online leaderboards that sync with an account IF you want to create one (GFWL sucks, no way around it).+ Nice voice acting. You can hear really good the instructions from your partner.+ Loads fast (again port, so on a HDD the load is way quicker)ConsThe cons are mostly revolve around the fact that this is a port and a quorky one at that.- Very VERY sensitive controls, don't try keyboard even if your life was depended on it. With controller things get better but still if you are low tempered you will surely throw the controller out the window. That's because PS Vita analog sticks have very small area of reaction, 1o in PS Vita corresponds to 10o in controllers so you have to somehow amend to that and the solution is to make the controlls very sensitive. Don't try to change the sensivity, you will make things worse.- Repetitive gameplay. Same tracks 80% of the time and no other modes like 1vs1 race or something else.- No team pros and cons. It would give the game a bit depth to the team you choose but only car power (also uninteresting) matters.- Weird way classes of WRC are shown. Junior I get, but what's the difference between WRC 1,2 or 3 ?- If the game crashes for no reason, you might be welcomed later with a message saying ""Your save game is corrupted"", also for no reason.- If you get stuck while trying to upload your times inbetween races you either lose the race or your save game, again, for no reason.- Way to pricy for a bare bone experience. 30 dollars ? You mad son ? DIRT 3 costs 25 and since yesterday the GFWLess version with all the DLC included just got released for 22.5 dollars. Pick it up only for 50% sale and above only.- Did I mention the save games get corrupt easy ?The only reason I give it thumps up is because I bought it on sale both in PS VIta and for my traveling PC, otherwise I prefer DIRT 3.

												The trailer looks great and sucks you in sadly that was the only good part of the game the trailer lol.FFB is non existant for lots of devices even thou it says they are supported such as the Logitech G27 wheel there is some FFB if you run with thier settings (none if you want to customise your wheel to use less than 900Deg rotation) and as stated this is only some FFB no road surface feedback at all.It doesnt look all that great either for a game released in 2013 its kinda poor visuals.I played for a bit got very board and got rid of it as there doesnot seem to be any updates or fixes coming for the FFB maybe this could be good if you donot use a controler or wheel but im not that kind racer.compared to WRC3 this is a giant leap backwards and I mean leap.Doesnt run very well either on two GTX580 from MSI in SLi / AMD Phenom II 1090T OC @4.8Ghz / 8GB DDR3 G-Skill Ripjaws @2000Mhz and Samsung Evo SSD.just another dev trying to make a quick dash for your cash dontlet them have it this is a turd.

												Everything you could expect if you follow the World Rally Championship. Every car and every team from the championship is available. If you are not familar with the WRC, its a rally racing game tha features alot of cars and a few tracks. I think the most desapointing thing in the game in the number of stages for each rally, which is only 6 (six).Racing is fun and emersive, sounds and graphics could be better but its not bad for a 4 year old game.

												I'll keep this short:- game is buggy as can be. Be prepared to spend a good couple of hours simply to get the game to work properly. (controller setup won't work, sound issues, random crashes, only works with v-sync enabled on 30fps)- Controls feel mediocre at best. There is always a sense of delay, and the force feedback is almost not noticeable at all. Ow and don't think about left foot braking because you HAVE to configure your pedals to be combined (welcome back to the 90's)- If you're into games like Dirt, this might be a welcome change if you are looking for something a bit less arcadey, and if you can manage to live with all the flaws.- If you ever played a game like Richard Burns Rally and expect something similar from WRC4.

												I thought I was going to be very disappointed with this game when I first ran it but how wrong could I have been.  It is simply a blast to play.  Graphics are excellent.  Cars drive really well.  I did have to load a MOD to improve the feedback a little bit from the standard default settings to give the wheel a bit more feeling.  The only draw back I can see at the moment is that there is no online game play - or I have yet to find it?  Such an improvement on WRC which failed for me in all aspects of game play, graphics and wheel support.  Give it a 8 out of 10 overall.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall impression: There are few games that fill the rally niche these days, and this game does a good job of staying true to the rally format but it does have some shortcomings.  I only recommend this game if you are a hardcore rally fan and tired of all the extra crap in dirt 2 & 3.  If you can power through the frustrating control issues (see below) its still pretty fun if you get it cheap (humble bundle for $10 - I wouldn't pay more for it)Pros: solid rally format & careeradjustable car settings - front & rear suspension, transmission and bodywork (downforce)mostly supports force feedback wheelsmultiplayer (?) I don't really do the multiplayer thing..Cons:Force feedback is a bit weak / throttle response only recognizes the pedal at 90% so it is mostly full throttle or noneEven though linearity is adjustable you can't disable it completely so the wheel is very unresponsive at high speedsgraphics are sub-par for this day & ageenabling v-sync in game created horrible lag with the steering wheel controls, forced on through radeonpro""statistic upload"" at the end of every stage (6 stages in a rally) fails and has to be canceled every time.support appears to be mostly french speakingSpecs: AMD R9 290 w/ Fanatec CSR wheel, CSR Elite pedals & sequential shifter ",101,66,30,11,5,2,14

												6/10 – Great when it works but do not buy for full price.Pros – Great visuals, tight fun controls, great new career structure, authentic audio and atmosphere Cons – Broken multiplayer, constant crashing, inconsistent frame rates, career progress can erase itself, plenty of recycled content.---------------------------------Full ReviewAnnual games are becoming more of a norm now a days as developers push less risky ideas and even though I am not the biggest fan, I do approve if it is done right. To be able to introduce enough new ideas on an annual basis to warrant such a yearly purchase is hard, but not impossible.Sadly the WRC series is not such a series. It was made extremely clear to me by WRC 2 (2011) that recycling content was a normal thing. Now, 4 years since the first of the WRC games I still feel the effects. But fear not, as this year’s game feels fresher than ever. Whether or not this is acceptable however, is up for debate. WRC 4 starts right out of the gate with a few very welcome changes. Gone is the boring dreary campaign that forces you to slowly crawl up the ranks. In WRC 4 you can get to the top level of the WRC in only a few hours, but also allows you to go down to the lower levels if you wish. This gives you a bit of freedom in your style of play. Like the real series, the higher the division of the WRC you compete in the more events are played out before seasons end. So by the time you compete in the top level you will be running the whole official calendar before one of these seasons is over. This year the developers went with authenticity; something that is always welcome in an official racing game. Everything from the main menu (which shuffles real slow motion shots of rallies past) to the 3 day breakdown of each rally makes the game feel more realistic then it ever has.  The stages themselves too feel far more varied. Most rallies have a unique flavour to them. Finland is flying with many blind crests, and the UK has deep mud and rain. Gone is the mirrored feeling of many of the stages in previous games. Instead you are fought with tight hairpins, and Cliffside falls. This gives the game a sharper feel of power and control; allowing the player to truly push as hard as he dares. Even though the new stages are impressive, many issues around come into focus. Some of which has never been addressed since the very first game. The main issue is replicating certain turns. Although not as bad as previous games or the horridly copied game that was WRC 2, there are still many segments that have either been seen before in previous game or are blatantly taken from other rallies! I found a perfect example with an uphill double hairpin that was in Sweden and then again in Australia. I have never had a problem with reusing the same stages in different configurations to create multiple runs of one rally, but to copy the same turns and then paste them elsewhere in a supposed other country is just irritating. It creates a heavy sense of déjà vu, creating fast player fatigue.The audio in game also creates a step forward for the series. Gone are the horrible electronic songs that felt wildly out of place and instead you hear more of a smooth sounding beat. The problem here however is that there is only one song. You think they could have added a few more. Worse than the single song soundtrack is the horrible co-driver which makes a shocking 4th straight appearance in this series. They have not changed the horrible sounding co-driver… EVER. This being a rally game your co-driver is essentially to the game. You have to listen to him to know what is coming up. The problem here is he sounds so mechanical that it is hard to get into a groove. He says turns in such a choppy fashion I am dumb founded that the developers have not made a better sounding co-driver after 4 flipping games! He also has a tendency to call notes too late causing you to miss a turn.  I guess they never expected people to drive faster than the co-driver. On a positive side for the audio is not all bad. The engine sounds are a big plus. All WRC cars sound very unique from one other making them a joy to listen to. From the smooth gear shift of the DS3 to the harsh pop shift of the Polo, it’s a real treat to listen to the vehicles in action.This year’s game has also taken a huge step up graphically. Even though it is still not even close to the level that which was set by Codemasters DiRT games, it is still a hefty step up from last year’s visuals. The damage model however is still lacking and the water effects are still pathetic but other than that the game looks great. The problem with the game is: it clearly is not ready to be sold. The game is littered with broken content; the main one of which is multiplayer. To enter multiplayer you first must register for their online service. This pointless step forces people to register their username and emails before entering. This also complicates things as they do not tell you this in any shape or form upon attempting to get online. Instead upon entering multiplayer they will notify you that your “nickname” is incorrect. It wasn’t until I used help forums that I realized I had to register prior to entering online. You would think that once registered that would be that, but it gets better: once I registered I was able to play online for only 3 days at which point again they told me my nickname was incorrect. I am not interested in re-authenticating my email 2 times a week for their stupid system. What little time I was in online events I would frequently encounter game crashes and disconnections. What little I played online told me that the online structure is a very basic model. With up to 16 playera and offering only ghost vs game play it is not worth the pain of entry. Online simply doesn’t work; sufficed to say, I have given up on it. These issues continue in other modes however. My final straw was when the game erased my career for seemingly no reason.Now I did start this by stating the series is NOT a good contender for the yearly model which might seem odd as most I have said so far was positive apart from some broken content. The game is a step up for the most part and the game (when it runs) is really fun and tight, but you don’t buy an apple for a few bites and that’s what this game is: a few bites and nothing more. A game that struggles this much to bring working content and not requiring constant recycled content should not need to release a game on a yearly basis. I would recommend this game ONLY if it is not listed for full price. What the game offers is amazing, but losing my career and not being able to play online is enough for me to not recommend it to people who want the complete experience. A series like this needs to take a year off and rethink its strategy.I give this game a 6/10. It is really fun and the game play is really enjoyable but with only half the content working it’s hard to recommend it to everyone. ",114,17,10,13,17,1,18

												I have played this game a decent amount and while it's not terrible it's not great either.The game looks somewhat decent, I personally have found no bugs that way. The physics are very, very far away from being a true simulation. Front wheel drive cars do not actually behave like they are front wheel drive. You have to try to actually make them understeer. The different road surfaces do not always feel all that different either, the cars never seem to lack grip no matter what surface you are on. There are occasional issues with physics that make you spin in weird directions too ( like turning right and grabbing the handbrake and the car suddenly spins left).Car tuning is very basic and does not save between stages. Big changes to the setup of a car don't effect it that much. No choice of tires, no varible weather. I feel that even with steering lock at maximum the car always seems to react slowly to my input (xbox 360 controller). The car just turns to slowly even when you move to full travel of the stick you wait for the car to catch up.Tracks are generic, all of the stages are the previous stage reversed or pieces of the other stages combined ( apparently they all take place in the same 3-5 mile stretch of road) which is an issue I had noticed in the previous WRC games. The stages are a great deal longer than those in Dirt 3. In Dirt 3 the stages are over far to fast and never really felt like a rally, this does improve on that at least. Co-driver is not always synced with the track and can be telling you about the corner you are currently in not the next one even with maximum delay. Some of the co-driver notes are wrong also ( saying left for a right turn, hairpins when its really a 2 or 3 etc.)The Career is far to easy IMO. I have played on the hardest settings from day 1 and never really had an issue winning any stage. I was able to skip WRC3 completely and even when driving a ""lower performing"" car in the same class I had no problem beating the other cars by 10secs or more per stage.The game is not all bad, but is definitely not a great game either. There have been far better in the past, in fact I think WRC 2 was a bit better. It does trump Dirt 3 in the track length department, though I feel Dirt 3 stages are apallingly short. I wouldn't pay full price for it by any means. I think you would get a better more real experience picking up an old Colin Macrae game for Xbox than this.Pros:Decent gameplay, though not realisticnice to see actual sponsors in all divisionsStages are of decent lengthCons:physics are flakeyCo-driver is flakeyTracks seem copy pastedcareer mode feels to easybugs you about not connecting to the internet after every stagedoes not keep car setup between stages			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I own and enjoy the first WRC game by the same developers which came out in 2010, so I thought I would get this when I saw it cheap in a sale for 80% off.The game seems to have changed little since then  - the graphics are slightly improved but not much.  In some respects I think I prefer the original's graphics which aren't quite as colourful perhaps, but look more realistic as a result. There is still no weather to speak of, most stages are dry with clear skies - no heavy downpours or snowstorms here, something which the Colin McRae Rally games had since the late 1990s!  I would say that Colin McRae Rally 2005, in fact even Colin McRae Rally 3, had better graphics than this game as well despite being much older.  Unfortunately Codemasters stopped making semi-realistic rally games like that, and went full arcade.  Dirt 1 was still somewhat realistic but by Dirt 3 it dropped any pretense of realism and lost me entirely.  If you hanker after old school rally games like the Colin McRae series then WRC is all that's on offer today.  I would say it's better than Dirt 3 (except graphically) but inferior to the others.  The car handling seems to have taken a step back since the first WRC game and the cars are now much harder to drift without using the handbrake - even full throttle while steering on ice it is very hard to get the car to drift, perhaps this was dumbed down to make the game 'easier' and more casual but it makes the cars less satisfying to drive for me.  (I did make sure stability assist was turned off.)There are 6 stages per country but in my view this is very misleading because essentially, and I'm not exaggerating unfortunately, all stages look and play the same.  You don't have the feeling of progressing across a country but of driving the same tiny part of it, 6 times!  It's really very lazy I'm afraid.  Also the stages have FAR too many corners and not enough straights - the first WRC game and indeed real life WRC isn't like this.  So you are constantly bombarded with corner after corner after corner which becomes monotonous and tiring, and there are none of the exhilarating exciting super fast sections of the first game. WRC 4 lacks the group B cars of WRC 1, like the RS200 which is disappointing.Overall the game feels like a budget release, despite its full price tag and I would only recommend getting it when heavily discounted, and even then you probably won't be fully satisfied with it. I gather that WRC 5 is coming out this year but by new developers.  Hopefully they will put a lot more effort, polish and love into their game than this has had.			",134,23,26,12,10,3,11

I could get into all of the reasons why this game fell way short, but I've already wasted enough time playing it, so I'm not going to waste any time talking about it. Just get Dirt 3.

Judging by the number of people experiencing similar issues, and the lack of developer updates, I'm not sure it will ever get to that state.

												There's much to like about this game. The car handling is fine for my tastes (which run towards the arcade more than the sim as I play with a keyboard) and there are different classes represented, making for a good career mode. The rallies are characterful and distinct and sometimes beautiful, and the stages are good fun to drive, and generally quite twisty and narrow - which is good in a rally game.There are some things that could be improved. The game feels clunky on my computer, which is up to the task of running Bioshock Infinite but lags sometimes in this game with the lighting effects. The menu systems are clumsy. I like the fact that stages are run as pairs between services, as this somewhat replicates the WRC experience, but the damage system is too generous. In games like Colin McRae Rally 4, choosing parts to repair became quite a strategic decision, especially when the car was fairly easily damaged in stages with jumps. The pacenotes are vague as well, but that's not a problem unique to this game. My biggest frustration is one that might not concern a casual gamer too much, but it concerns the design of rallies. Although the individual stages themselves are good, the developers are not true to the WRC experience when they take names that in real life belong to entirely different stretches of road and use them to label a stage that is a minor variation of a previous one. And that is how the rallies are organised - different permutations of the same little patchwork of roads, with each section reused over and over again. Of course, WRC events often repeat stages - so why doesn't the game do it in the same way, if the developers must reuse stages? Instead of doing something like using the Col de Turini and St. Bonnet names for very similar stages (when in real life they refer to stages hundreds of kms apart), just have Col de Turini 1 and Col de Turini 2. And make the second pass over the stage different - different weather and a surface that reflects the passage of the rally route. For me, this annoyance reduces the replay value of the game, but I would still recommend it to anybody with an interest in motorsport.			",36,12,10,11,31,0,12

												I'll give a quick run-down of my experiences, but I'd thoroughly recommend you look elsewhere for a rally or even just car game. This is not a good place to look for any accuracy in how the cars perform or react to different conditions.Pros:Career Mode is nice, relatively fleshed out.Track variation; it doesn't re-use the same level with different portions cut out for a 'different' track layout.Neither Good/Bad:Graphics are dated, but it's a rally game. They have looked quite good for a while now.Slowdowns in the menu whenever the menu overlay is visible. The in-race performance is quite a bit better than this.No different weather conditions on tracks, or night. You're stuck with Dawn, Noon, Dusk and whatever weather they decided to stick on the track.Cons:Physics feel like you're driving on vaseline, huge lack of feedback from the track(if there's a ditch you'll notice though) and slapstick-like reactions to any sort of collision without any semblance of weight. This lack of semblance of weight carries through to handling as even heavy cars feel like they are merely gliding across the track's surfaces. There is no fighting at the edge of what a car can do.Sounds seem to be very short samples that noticeably loop. This, along with a lack of differentiation between the bonnet view and driver view's sound levels makes it a chore to listen to. The co-drivers' voices are muffled and distorted on top of this, making them hard to hear at the default levels.What the Co-driver says does not always match up to the track, or the visual representation of what they're saying. This visual representation is also often wrong, especially for chicanes.There has been no post-release support, and longstanding issues have not been fixed in a patch. Do not expect this to change for anything you experience in-game that is detrimental to your enjoyment of this product.This is my view from having played it. I'd like to like it, but the lack of physicality regarding the cars just makes me cringe.			",267,51,11,29,47,1,46

												WRC4 is the official 2013 WRC game and was developed by Milestone games.Pros:+ All official WRC, WRC2, WRC3, and WRC Junior 2013 drivers and cars.+ All 13 official WRC 2013 countries, with 6 stages each.+ Nice modern Rally car list.+ Stages are varied and challenging enough. (they also feel narrow and dangerous, as rally should be)+ Long and fun Career mode, you start at junior WRC and make your way to the WRC 3, WRC 2, and finally the main WRC.+ OK graphics. (See the screenshots and videos) + OK Sounds.+ Decent Arcady Handling physics. (Played with X360 controller)Cons:- Less cars than previous games, the 70's 80's 90's and Group B cars present on previous games are missing, leaving us with only the modern WRC 2013 cars.- Many stages share the same sections on each country, and some are just reversed stages that are treated as new.- No weather variations (each country is fixed to its weather, like snowy, raining or dry).- No night races.- The Co-driver has some pacing and consistency issues sometimes.- I wish the AI times were more varied, 99% of the times Loeb is the fastest AI driver, followed by Ogier or Latvala. that makes championships too predictable. - The rewind feature is welcome, but not very well made, if you make a mistake you have to wait some kind of cooldown time, so if you crash, rewind, and crash in the same place, you will not be able to rewind again for a while, and this can be very frustrating for more casual players.- Having to use a Launcher is annoying.There are better rally games on the market, but overall this is a decent Rally game, more focused on the 'official' side of rallying, and I can recommend it if you are a fan of real-life WRC and can get a nice discount (75% off).

												What can I say.. got this at the Humble Weekly Plug In Digital Bundle and for the quality it must be the weakest point of that bundle. That I can say before testing the others, I mean come on!Milestone still have a miles ahead to the podium with big boys such as Dirt 2 and 3. Cannot really find a single reason to purchase this title, like if you have played those foremention Codies titles, after that no way you're going to like this. The development is years behind of those already years behind titles. For the PC gamers, no PC specific menus at the game, only at launcher where you get to choose resolution and couple other things, such as vsync on/off. As game is locked to 30FPS, to get past that vsync must be disabled. After you have done that, prepare some bumpy ride, because it could be the jerkiest 60FPS you have ever seen. I mean, I have played dozens of games locked to 30 frames and they were more fluid than this at past 60FPS! I was having a motion sickness seriously for the first time, thank god I didn't needed a bucket.There are potential, don't get me wrong. As example driving model is quite all right, but that's about it. At full prize it would take a real rally head to buy this.Hope still lives on, maybe the next upcoming title in WRC series will be better..? Or maybe we get Dirt 4 and forget all about this.

												For those who really enjoy a *relatively* hard rally game, it's a good choice.I've played WRC2 on X360 and found the graphics really enjoyable (in despite of most critics), but for some reason, the overall graphic quality for WRC4 has dropped substantially. Why?I've played DiRT 1/2/3/SD and, indeed, Codemasters' graphics rule, but their increasingly efforts to bring DiRT closer to the X-Games had me very upset. We lack for a good real rally game with good graphics. But, if I were to choose between graphics and gameplay (as I'm being forced to do), here's my choice.			",151,15,9,10,6,0,9

												This is an acade based rally game. If your looking for a serious hardcore Rally sim try Dirt Rally or find an oldschool copy of RBR. I like both casual and sim but this is definetley more casual.What a fantastic arcade game!! Good graphics, fun gamplay and a career mode that plays just like I like it. I find it almost mind numbing to read reviews when people compare this game to Dirt 3. Dirt 3 is more like a racing game with some rally in it. Dirt 3 does not focus on rally souly and the career mode is disjointed bouncing you between rally, gymkhana etc. WRC however is a RALLY game! Its kinda like when anyone compares any other shooter to COD (annoying) The career mode is one of the best I have ever played and is very similar to the old V-Rally 3 career mode. While V-rally wasnt wonderful the career setup was the nuts. In WRC you start at the bottom in Junior WRC depening on how your season goes you will be offered the chance to move up to WRC3, WRC2 and finaly WRC. You get rivals and objectives along the way. I highly recommend this game to any RALLY fan and I am already hoping and looking forward to the next one.Edit, I see milestone games getting a lot of stick recently. The only issue I have had with this game and other titles is some instability on the online servers and engine sounds are bland (standard milestone problem). Other than that its a solid title.

												Generally an all round fun game. I like that you can launch it and get into driving quickly if you only want to do one quick stage.The physics seem solid and it is a decent looking game though is no DIRT. Could really use some higher resolution textures to bring it up to more of a PC standard than last generation console. I may just be missing something as I can't see any options for graphics other than the basic ones in the launcher. The level design seems to be quite good from what I've played so far though the water you drive through (small puddles) isn't particularly great. Perhaps on some stages there is actually some depth to the water?Career mode seems to be well designed so far and the damage management and range of car setup options add a lot to the game. You can really customize the car to precisely how you want it to feel while driving.Overall, this is one of the best rally games I have played and is thoroughly enjoyable. 9/10 would recommend.

 If you really want a good rally/rallycross game just go for Dirt Rally. It’s so much better. If you really do want this game then here is my quick assessment- Good selection and range of stages- Decent selection of cars- Over the top menu music- Cheesy/ over the top SFX- Arcade, almost mobile-like driving physicsReally reminds me of the old WRC games on PSP from back in the day. Dont get it unless it's stupidly cheap or if you really want to play an old rally game.4/10 ",683,231,29,122,94,19,117

												Great game and leaves the DIRT series from a rally point of view in the dust!!!!!  It is not perfect but as a genre that is SERIOUSLY lacking in representation it is the best there is out there.  I agree that the six stages in each rally are the same whatever class you are in, and hopefully in future editions this will be improved.  I couldn't care less about everyone else's beef about the poor quality spectator animations, you only see them for a few seconds at the beginning of each stage.  The rallying itself is very well done and very exciting and as you move up the classes the cars get more powerful and also more challenging and to me that is the key ingredient in a game like this.If more people support it and stop whining about spectator animations as opposed to seeing the game as a whole then Milestone will hopefully continue to support and improve the game in future editions.  I have already heard that this version is a huge step up from the previous two.  Sure the graphics in the DIRT series are snappier but how often now do you get to rally in the DIRT series and talk about repetition in the few rallies that are offered overlaid with peurile dudespeak. If you love rallying this is definitely a serious bang for your buck and I am sure it will only get better in the future.  If hurling a car around some spectacular courses is your gig - buy this you definitely won't be disappointed.			",178,10,17,31,25,1,96

												Ok -loved Colin McRae rally in the past. Recently bought new PC capable of playing games again and wondered what were the best rally games. WRC4 seemed to get best reviews so one purchase later and i am off. First impressions - it is more ""arcade like"" than CM. not a big problem as i was pretty crap to start and was using keyboard controls. Alothough one thing DID annoy me - at the check points i could be 20 seconds behind best time, then i finish and i am 0.83 secs and in second place!! Now i might be able to mess around and work out how this can be amended but as a default it devalues any good achievements later.Car handling is pretty good but again standard set-up is about keeping you on the road.

												I was interested but skeptical at hitting the purchase botton sense day 1 on Steam at the $40 price. Waiting for a good price I just gave in and paid the $12 sale price not expecting much, I am now about 4 hours into the game and really enjoying it. If your a fan of Dirt 1/2 you will enjoy WRC 4.  It was a let down to find their was no TrackIR support, fancy DX11 not so fancy looking at a stand still but strangely looks great at high speed. I would recommend playing in cockpit view, a good headset, 360 pad and adjust the audio levels. All and all id say WRC 4 is great filler for a good price waiting for the next big rally game.

												Mother of GOD, this game is bad. Feels like you're driving a bathtub rather than a car. I should have known better after being screwed over by WRC3 where the sound wouldn't work because I had the cheek to use a surround sound headset (their support team actually told me to use stereo speakers to play the game or disable surround sound before playing). I hoped for more here, I didn't get it. It's clumsy, ugly and an embarrassment to the WRC name.			",289,41,24,19,14,1,20

												While I don't usually think of myself as a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, in this particular instance I'm almost forced to be given the fact that the graphics in this game are terrible compared to your DiRT 3s et al.I've also come across those who claim DiRT 3 is more of an arcade-style racer whereas this is more of a simulation, however this couldn't be further from the truth. If you wanted to play a proper rally simulation, then you'd look no further than Richard Burns Rally which will test your ability to even drive along a straight line for more than a couple of seconds.So where does that leave WRC 4 exactly? Well Codemasters have had years of experience creating games that hit the right balance between gameplay/playability and realism (including the likes of TOCA and even Micro Machines), however WRC 4 seems to want to accelerate in a direction that facilitates neither of these core features; obviously content in the hopes that the WRC license alone would be enough to carry it through. Well it doesn't work I'm afraid. Also throw into the mix the weird sound effects which sound 'tinny' due to its poor quality and implementation, and what you're left with is a game that couldn't possibly be recommended to anyone.

												Firstly, let's just make two things clear: this game was released in October 2013 - it costs, currently, £24.99.Now, bearing in mind the release date, you might expect the game to look fairly nice. It doesn't. At all. It's passable for 2005, but in 2013 I expected a little more, and considering how dull and uninteresting the game appears visually, my PC kicks out volumes of heat when playing it - perhaps that's due to not using the game's v-sync option which locks the frame-rate at an absurd and choppy 30FPS. It's that, screen-tearing or using a third-party tool to force v-sync. Again, 2013 - £24.99.At least the game works, until it hangs on menu screens, or until upon loading a stage it goes deadly silent unless you're willing to exit out and start it up again. A couple of bugs, we can look past those. The gameplay, though, is where it counts, and for WRC 4, where it fails further. There is no satisfaction to be found here. In a rally we have six stages, most of which are the same stage, just with different start/finish lines, and all of which are drab and unappealing. The driving gives no palpable sensation of the road you're on, the jumps are floaty, the layouts are packed with hairpins (I hope you like the sound of the rev-limiter), your co-driver bleats monotonous directions at you, and irritatingly, loves to comment when you can't pick the road texture out from the not-road texture and drive into things: ""whoa, careful"". 2013. £24.99.But, perhaps you really love the WRC and your options are limited to pretty much this or, at a leap, Dirt 3. This is better than nothing, right? It isn't. It isn't at all. Go sit in a puddle and I guarantee you'll have a better time. I know Dirt 3 has ""Gymkhana"" which is as detestable as forcing ""drifting"" into racing games, but the Trail Blazing events make up for it. Whilst Dirt 3 isn't a good game, it has a few really enjoyable moments, whereas WRC 4 is a frustration throughout.			",285,157,11,34,21,3,17

												The game's got potential, but feels like it's been made by someone that just didn't give a beep.  First off, the console port is poorly pulled off. You can't use your mouse despite the curser being presented ingame.  The keys you need in the menus are at times awkward (enter to select and space to activate? the opposite of most games). Sometimes you need to press odd, nonconfigurable buttons to do things. Most things work with arrow keys, but then you need to find F2 all of a sudden etc.   There's damage in the game, but it doesn't properly work. Sometimes you can race into a wall at 100km/h and just drive on without damage. Also damage doesn't seem very pronounced while driving.   You have to select your manager, but whom you take seem not to matter, and they're not voice acted and just leave standard template messages without emotion. So basically you just pick the name to fill into the templates.  Speaking of templates - during loadscreens there are 'interviews' with other players. However they have very few lines to say, and these are even shared between different opponents, so you get bored of em before you've completed your second rally.   There's also a reputation system in place to manage which things you've got access to, but even when you win all stages you're being sent along a very linear path without any true freedom of choice.   After a rally you're presented with a newspaper detailing what's going on in the four different classes available. However sometimes when you're looking at a class other than the one you're in, the template will beep up and just display something like %%S01_AI2_Points%% Points ahead of %%S01_AI3_Name%% etc.   The text describing the teams doesn't seem to have been proofread or using templates that make it obsolete. I noticed one of the WRC2 teams was described as driving a Subaru, but the car depicted was a Mitsubishi.   The steam achievements seem to have been an afterthought. You get an achievement for doing the most mundane things, like opening your repair screen. But you don't get any for doing extraordinary things. I tried to drive the Spain WRC Junior rally without using repairs or rewinds, and won. But nothing popped up other than the one for completing the rally.   Speaking of rewind. There's that in the game, as expected in this day and age. But if you rewind and keep the brake button down, you'll not brake, you'll actually reverse. I'm assuming that's a bug.   And now we're at bugs, I don't think they've cared about any that didn't crash the game. The water animation for water patches, at least in mexico, are sometimes running the wrong way, making water seem to go uphill. According to Newton, this isn't meant to be.   Every time you complete a special stage (which seems to be the only part of rally being in the lackluster career mode), you get an error message about uploading your stats. I haven't found a way for it to stop trying to upload my data somewhere I haven't given consent to yet.   I'm sure with a little bit of tweaking, this could've been a good game, but considering it came up last year and I still find all those errors, they can't be bothered doing so. If the game's sold at 2€ or so, try it out, but expect an indie game, not a professional release by a well funded publisher. The game isn't terrible, but if this was a codemasters product, it'd not have been released.			",1280,529,93,186,187,22,306

												For a simularion rally racing game this game gets car physics. However, that's it. The stages seem the same, the car sound is okay, the career is bland, it is just the racing that keeps you playing. I really enjoy the feels of each car but it takes a long time to switch cars. If you want replayability it is pretty lacking. If you want a game for racing feel this is a great game. Otherwise just save your money and buy Dirt 3.			",269,64,4,29,33,2,38

												For the short version; This game is pretty bad, not worth it's WRC license.Decided to finally give it a go. I had quite a lot of fun with WRC2 a few years ago, hoping that this would continue on it. Well, and that is exactly what it does, and not in a positive way. It is common that wen developers get the hang of a license, they improve on it, but not with Milestone!Graphics are pretty bad, they would be doable in 2007-2008, but we are quite a few years past that. The game literally has no graphic settings apart from V-Sync, FXAA and resolution and there are very few settings outside of that as well. To make matters worse this game is performing like absolute crap and is capped at 30FPS. I also had borders on my 1680x1050 resolution, I mean, seriously? I can understand it in videos because of the way they are rendered but i was having those borders in the actual game itself.The menus look rather cheap and with me the background videos werent playing properly. Could be my graphics card, but still, the first time I actually had issues with videos not playing properly.And then we get to setting up a driver. I don't know what they are thinking over at Milestone but it is very common to have a last name of more than 9 letters. It's sad that in 2013, game devs(only Milestone, apparently) are still not adapting to longer text boxes. Seriously, even old games had text boxes to 16 characters, but not with Milestone! This small thing just shows the abysmal quality of the game engine.Driving physics are doable and there is enough in terms of setup.Sounds is bad, but better than the average game. I don't know what they did with the Co-Driver, though, but I wouldn't call it good.The stages seem okay, although I seem to be getting a lot of the same parts. It seems like they have just reused the same parts over and over again.The pacenotes are pretty bad and are hardly ever correct, I've come across so many errors and inconsistencies in the pacenotes that there is very little point in actually listening to them.And if you are thinking of making an error and rolling down a cliff, something that is always a danger in real world WRC, don't worry, the game will reset you before you're actually falling down!This game is pretty abbysmal and way, way behind in tech. This game is just not worth it's WRC license.			",190,28,46,22,66,3,30

												I have not played this for long and for the first hour I couldn't get into it at all. I'd just come from DiRT 3 wanting longer tracks to keep me playing rather than navigating menu's every 5 minutes. I love DiRT 3 don't get me wrong, it's one of my favourite racing games on the PC. In my opinion it does few things better than this game. Car choice, out of car camera (specifically sense of speed using this camera) and sounds. The reason I didn't enjoy this game to start was the animation of the car seems off. There is no sense of speed when using an out of car camera, this really put me off wanting to play. I decided to push through though and experiment with the different cameras. Cockpit view has saved this game for me. The sense of speed is there and it has immediately become fun to play. The handling feels semi-realistic at most, but is certainly more so than the DiRT titles.Graphics -4/5Sound - 4/5Gameplay - 4.5/5TL:DR - If you love the out of car camera, then this game may not be for you.

												It's difficult to really compare WRC 4 to anything; it's so much more realistic than DiRT 3, it's so much more exciting than DiRT 1, it's so much newer than Colin McRae Rally, and, well, I don't have any experience rallying in real life. I guess its biggest competitor is DiRT 3, so let's get to it.WRC 4 is exactly what you'd expect it to be: a game that closely and faithfully follows the workings of the World Rally Championship 2013 season. The tracks are diverse and aplenty and the cars and teams are all in the WRC. They're limited to the 2013 season, which is kind of a bummer, but unlike DiRT 3, you get all of the 2013 cars with all of the liveries, as opposed to just a couple cars per class with a couple more that you have to pay for.Now you might be thinking, ""this all seems very serious, does this mean the cars are super-realistic and hard to control?"" And that's just the thing: the driving physics are realistic but easy to control, and you can change around the options to make it even easier. Due to being designed for the console market, it's been made very accessible to be played by everyone; it's like the Forza of rally games. Whereas DiRT 1 - the most realistic modern rally game I've played - is a total buzzkill with its constant grip and lack of a sense of speed, WRC 4 makes it feel like you're going really fast and barely in control, and at any point it can throw in a chicane and hairpin out of nowhere to make you spin even a front-wheel-drive car.And that's not even the best part. The best part is that this game makes you try hard not to crash. In DiRT 3, it doesn't really matter if you crash, because it takes a lot to do any mechanical damage and the weekends are so short that it'll be auto-repaired before long anyway. The first time you skid into a wall in WRC 4, on the other hand, you'll swear to yourself not to let it happen again. Crashing has more consequences in this, and you'll find yourself repairing even the most minor damage in the service park at the end of each day, and--...Okay, I'm gushing, so I should wrap this up. WRC 4 is a freaking great game and you should buy it if you think DiRT 3 wasn't as good as it could have been, or if you just want something a little exciting.			",46,11,9,3,7,0,2

												I have put a few hours into WRC4. My summation would be: if you are a WRC fanatic, you will like this game. Why? Because it is the only modern WRC game available.There is a TON that could be improved in the game, but it is a decent rally game. By far the worst thing is the wheel issues. I have gotten my DF GT working OK, but there are major issues.I have to disagree with people who don't think the handling is realistic. It is actually a very good balance between realsim and arcade handling. The different road surfaces are very noticeable giving each rally it's unique challenges.So if you love the WRC then you probably already own this game. It is only worth about 20$ because it isn't a super polished AAA title, while it is also not a 5$ bin budget title.			",3,0,3,0,0,0,1

The handling is pretty good, but im happy with the career mode im getting stuck in to that and its decent.People moaning about how boring or tideious it is its a rally game!! its about stage times and online racing, i love playing the same stage over and over shaving seconds off, to me thats what its about.Plus they have addressed a good amount of the issues online works and achevments pop so again im happy!So if your a WRC fan or just love proper rallying get this!

												I was quite annoyed after I first bought the game at the sound problems. Well I changed the amount of voices and the problem has not happened since. Anyway the game itself is not bad, but not amazing. It has good but not great graphics, the presentation feels a little sparse and a little odd but thats my opinion and does not detract from the game. The car handling is the area I'm not absolutely sure about. For instance, driving on Swedens snow covered and narrow routes, I never felt like the car was out of control, or was likely to be. I won the first 3 rallies in my career and never once crashed seriously or had any retirements or wrecks. At the same time the game plays well and some of the torturous routes leave you feeling satisfied when you cross the line intact.So it gives me mixed feelings overall, its fun to play and can be a challenge, at the same time perhaps the car handling makes the game a little easy.

												For the short version; This game is pretty bad, not worth it's WRC license.Decided to finally give it a go. I had quite a lot of fun with WRC2 a few years ago, hoping that this would continue on it. Well, and that is exactly what it does, and not in a positive way. It is common that wen developers get the hang of a license, they improve on it, but not with Milestone!Graphics are pretty bad, they would be doable in 2007-2008, but we are quite a few years past that. The game literally has no graphic settings apart from V-Sync, FXAA and resolution and there are very few settings outside of that as well. To make matters worse this game is performing like absolute crap and is capped at 30FPS. I also had borders on my 1680x1050 resolution, I mean, seriously? I can understand it in videos because of the way they are rendered but i was having those borders in the actual game itself.The menus look rather cheap and with me the background videos werent playing properly. Could be my graphics card, but still, the first time I actually had issues with videos not playing properly.And then we get to setting up a driver. I don't know what they are thinking over at Milestone but it is very common to have a last name of more than 9 letters. It's sad that in 2013, game devs(only Milestone, apparently) are still not adapting to longer text boxes. Seriously, even old games had text boxes to 16 characters, but not with Milestone! This small thing just shows the abysmal quality of the game engine.Driving physics are doable and there is enough in terms of setup.Sounds is bad, but better than the average game. I don't know what they did with the Co-Driver, though, but I wouldn't call it good.The stages seem okay, although I seem to be getting a lot of the same parts. It seems like they have just reused the same parts over and over again.The pacenotes are pretty bad and are hardly ever correct, I've come across so many errors and inconsistencies in the pacenotes that there is very little point in actually listening to them.And if you are thinking of making an error and rolling down a cliff, something that is always a danger in real world WRC, don't worry, the game will reset you before you're actually falling down!This game is pretty abbysmal and way, way behind in tech. This game is just not worth it's WRC license.			",190,28,46,22,66,3,30

												I love WRC and want to like this game but the physics really seem to be holding me back. I have a G27 wheel and spend most of my gaming time with racing sims now and this just dosn't hold up. I'm no rally driver so not so sure what snow, dirt and gravel should feel like at high speed but they all just dosn't feel right to me including the tarmac. It's most likely just because I have become a Sim Snob (but I mean they did put this under Simulation) but I'll  stick with RBR-RS.			",280,47,30,20,23,2,40

												An, over all, enjoyable driving experience. While a lot of the course hitboxes are exaggerated (which is a huge downer considering how you need to shave the rocks in turns) and the physics tend to be spastic at times, it does an excellent job of capturing the sensation of speed. It leaves you on the edge of your seat as you scream across dirt and mud path, trying to shave seconds off your time. $40 is a fair price, but it's definitely worth it once it goes on sale.

												If you own a laptop, do research before buying. I have a high end Asus (not new, though) and the game tells me it uses Intel chipset instead of GeForce GT 650M. As you may suspect, graphics look very meh. Tried to adjust resolution by hand and it partially worked, indicating that maybe the nVidia chipset is partially supported, but it remains unclear. Even if you don't care about the graphics (afterall, ten years ago this would be the best looking racer in the world even on low setings ;)), I also encountered huge graphical glitches (namely, sideborders jumping into the road and blocking the view).Otherwise the game looks amateurish, but ok (tried just a few stages though). Simmilar to CMR-DIRT series. Just don't expect the polish of the Dirt or the realism of Richard Burns. I expected the stages to save the day, but the ones I saw were very arcade like - short and twisty. In fact, they would look realy weak in Dirt 2 and that says a lot... Unless there are at least 10 minutes stages in there, it is NOT a WRC game. I sincerely don't care about the authenticity of logos and driver names. All in all, happy I bought it on sale, coz it would be 30 euros pretty much wasted.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The driving here isn't super fast, or super clean, but hey, it's my first attempt, and I sure am glad I finally gave this game a shot! Based on the forums it was hard to tell if this was an arcade game, or a simulator. After this drive I feel it's certainly more simulator than arcade. I used an X-Box 360 controller to get around the track, and it worked very well. I feel that this game is the spiritual successor of Colin McRae 2005, I haven't played a rally game this true to the sport since then. Here is a video of my first rally tournament:

Environments are gorgeous, the cars are well detailed, and they seem to include all the cars from the 2013 championship.  I've never been able to drive within the car for a rallying game, but this one is actually very enjoyable.  A very good and solid game, and I think I've seen Car Skin mods, so should have some replay value for me for a few years.  Like Rallying, this isn't a bad choice!			",141,3,20,12,14,0,12

This stands as a good substitute. - Has an interesting career mode, taking contracts and such.- Persistant damage between races which I found to give a subtle and unique sense of immersion- Great audio from engine sounds to co-pilot voiceworkSomething tells me this series has more popularity in other countries.

												I dunno what the people who gave this game negative reviews are smokin, but they need to quit... I'm guessing MOST of them have PCs that aren't powerful enough to run this, & or something about their version of Win, or antivirus messes it up... That being said, this game is BY FAR the very BEST rally racing game I've ever played PERIOD... Rally being the ONLY sort of racing that requires any skill besides street racing (which is usually the rich douchecanoe kid with the most expensive car winning), everything about this game is 100% AWESOME, it looks photo realistic (except perhaps the crowd, which do look good, but not picture perfect, & they fly by so fast you won't notice), the tarmac, the grass, the trees, lighting, weather effects, ALL look so close to real, you may forget it's a game if you're high/drunk enough... has a variable outside car view you can adjust to your liking, and two, yes TWO cockpit views (the 2nd close to windscreen one being the one ALL games should use) Real teams, real cars, the ability to adjust everything in your cars before a race, everything is awesome, & that's an understatement!!! I had no trouble making a profile, verifying My E-mail, then playing online either, so reviewers who had ""issues"" getting that feature to work either failed to read something, or quite frankly are dumb... If you like REAL racing that takes skittles, this is the driving SIM for you!!! Works GREAT with an X360 pad, & the difference between all driving help on, & off is perfect, drives arcadey with them on, & ""Oh crap a hairpin!!!"" with them off ☻ Personally I'd like a female Co-Driver, but thankfully you can turn his voice off, & select ""trackmap"" instead of arrows for your HUD 11/10 *			",133,4,24,8,9,1,1

												Altough graphics are somehow oudated, game itself bring some nice arcade rallying fun. For first time from ages (and I mean ages, Mobil 1 Rally Championship I think was last rally game with some part of license) we got official FIA licence which helps build rally mood, we got original WRC drivers in original cars battling on four WRC orignal levels. There is something like career mode which will guide you trough all four levels of World Rally Championship from Junior WRC to the top. Locations are official WRC sites but Milestone didn't recreate stages but simply make some variation about it keeping national character. Stages are disappointingly short, max 6km on one stage and 6 stages on one rally which gives us merely 25-30km of rallying on each locations. But stages are packed with action, so we still got fun twitching fingers on endless hairpins. To be not mistaken - this is not a simulator, stages are too short and setups too basic, but game itself could pretend to title of semi-simulator in which nicely done arcade parts like steering, setups or maps got added a pinch of simulation in physics and handling. There are some bugs, mostly in collssion detection and in handling but cautious driver could ride trough whole rally didn't noticing any part of it. Graphics are moderate, cars looks good, some stages also looks nice but some stages looks like unfinished (maybe they will finish it in console game Sebastian Loeb Rally Evo).Concluding - really nice rally rcade game with pinch of simulation reminding last rally oriented CMR game - Colin McRae 2005 (in first Dirt on 56 events only 18 were rally oriented with next 6 hill climbs).

												Whipeout city man! I think my controller is over responsive, but in any case, this game is fun to play! Great graphics and sound, and many options to boot. I waited for the price to drop, Steam sale, before I bought it. However, if you are into rally racing and have a better handle on the controls, this is your game. If you have fun laughing about how badly you can crash a rally car, this is your game too. I am the latter...hahaha!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hey, I ride Motorcycles ATV & Dirtbikes and some games are extreme-pure arcade or overly hardcore and harder to drive than real-life, this is a good blend of both making it fun. Despite the mixed reviews its a solid game, esp if u can get a sale. Its prob not quite as good as Dirt 3, but with my gamepad (i don't go all out with a wheel lol) that and GRID (street racing) seem like DRUNK Driving Simulators of just trying to stay straight and not bounce off walls like ping pong with-every tap of direction on the controller sending them flying and hard to not oversteer, despite option adjustments!  Its a good mix or realistic (of course can't go full throttle all the time) and playable. Dirt - I can drive a real car way better or at least keep it stright. I like the handling and all the tight turns-rather than just trying to fight to stay straight as I may have mentioned. The graphics are decent, some recycled parts of tracks and would be good to have the option for some more cars to race against, rather than feel like just racing the track. 7/10, hardcore race fans may disagreeVegan for AnimalsMeatvideo.com - MUST SEE factory-farms			",313,64,48,19,11,3,23

												If you can get this game on the cheap it is really not that bad and if you really like rally racing that helps as well. I have a few gripes with this game and others like it such as the F1 and the motogp series. One of the minor issues I have is the stupid portraits they have you pick from for your profile. Why don't they let you pick a picture from you computer or use your Steam avatar at least? None of the pictures look anything like me and now I have some guy that is not me and has nothing to do with me that I have to look at every time I play the game. The handling is not super realistic and it's super sensitive, I have been using a Xbox 360 gamepad and have not tried using the keyboard yet. They could have made cooler effects when you drive through mud, ice etc But the stages are done well and look great. Overall it's a decent racing game that is worth you're time if it's for the right price. If your not a huge racing fan I would look elsewhere for a better experience. I'll give this game a 65/100			",561,113,39,70,38,8,35

												I never played online because no one plays this game anymore as it is already old. The game keeps crashing and dropping FPS, but I disabled online features and the game stop doing all of that. So if you're buying this, DO NOT ACTIVATE ONLINE FEATURES at game settings. Everytime you finish a track (can it be called track? I think not) it will pop a message saying it could not syncronize the time you made, but it's ok as I said before, no one plays this game anymore.Back at the WRC 2, you could change tire settings, here you can't. WRC 3 was more focused at completing stunts and all. Here on WRC 4 is like playing WRC 1 again. all you have to do is win championships.How can they not have female voices for co-drivers? :/ even if you play with a team that the co-driver is female, the voice is a male's voice. That was very indelicate from developers... u.uThe sound effects here is nice!I think WRC 3 was more fun from all the special events like driving old cars and all.			",33,2,2,1,5,0,0

												So... When it comes to driving games I like using a wheel (Logitech G25) but not the pedals or shifter. So for things like camera changes etc I use keyboard commands.Guess what? With this game, you can either use the wheel or keyboard. Not a combination of both. Terrible setup option there. No custom control setup option either to bypass this.From what I saw of the graphics they were reasonable for the release time, though.			",22,0,3,2,5,0,9

												For me (as casual rally genre game player) This game is no DiRT but it stands on its own merits and with all this nonsense about GFWL breaking my copy of DiRT 2 (and being removed from steam) Showdown being rather.. not what I want. This stands as a good substitute. - Has an interesting career mode, taking contracts and such.- Persistant damage between races which I found to give a subtle and unique sense of immersion- Great audio from engine sounds to co-pilot voiceworkSomething tells me this series has more popularity in other countries. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll get back to pretending I'm not pacing around the living room in unabated anticipation waiting for a DiRT 4 annoucement.So true man, cheers for that!			",34,2,8,2,3,0,3

Then you need this! It will challenge you, thrill you, throw you into walls at speed, make you laugh, make you gasp, get your heart racing and keep you coming back for more.The opponents are challenging, the tracks are believable, the vehicles handle as you would expect them to, and all in all it is surprisingly realistic..

Some of the tracks aren't authentic or well designed.The pace notes for many of the stages are very, very wrong.Graphics looked dated for it's relatively new age.Some of the sounds, particularly when driving through tunnels are just awfuloverall i'd give this a 6.5/10and I do recommend it, if it's cheap and on sale.

												Even though the game tends towards a simulation, this should not discourage those players that do not care for car configuration or excessively realistic difficulty. Setting the player AI to 1 (from a maximum of 8), turning off most driving aids I was able to completely dominate each special stage, winning everything. So no frustration and the fun of experiencing the different tracks and cars. If you liked the DiRT series, this game can actually be easier to win (see above setting), but that it completely up to you. The visuals may be slightly older, but on my five-year-old PC (ATi HD 5850) the game runs at around 60 FPS solid, so no worries there. Definitely get it from the bargain bin if you like rally driving games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
