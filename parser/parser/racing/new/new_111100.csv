												Snuggle Truck attempts to do something very simple in what it offers, and for the most part it succeeds. The main problem comes with the frustration of acquiring all medals available.The basic premise of the game is to go through groups of increasingly difficult levels and achieve specific goals in order to earn medals. There are easy, medium, hard, and extreme groups of levels. In easy and medium, it's actually fun to hone in your skills and fight for all the medals. In the hard levels, the fun begins to diminish into something comparable to an annoying task or a dreadful job. The extreme levels are so much worse than the hard levels, that the experience ceases completely from being a game and fully becomes a terrible chore, or a punishment.If getting the basic medal for all levels is enough to please you, then you'll be able to easily beat the game in less than an hour. On the other hand, if you're a perfectionist, and getting all possible medals is your goal, I'm sure that there may be at least ten hours of entertainment here for you. There are also some bonus developer created levels, as well as thousands of user created levels for you to download from within the game, but actually wanting to experience this much content will depend on how patient you are and how much fun you are able to get out of Snuggle Truck.Snuggle Truck is okay.

												When I first saw snuggle truck in my steam library, I asked why? Why was there a game called snuggle truck in my steam library? This question haunted my very existence for days. Did I buy it? Did I get it in some humble bundle I spent ten cents on? Was it a sigh from some great cosmic God? I hesitated to play this game because its name had suggested such unimaginable terror.  Would it consume my very soul? Every time I opened the steam client I would see it there, waiting for me, waiting for a moment of weakness where I would finally break down and play it. I fought off the urge for weeks, but deep down I realized that one day I would have to play it. The day finally came, I could no longer fight against it, I clicked on it and installed it. So trucks, such ponies, much physics.			",71,5,2,13,8,1,10

												The concept is fun and addictive at the start, but in all it doesn't feel like anything more than a Flash game; the only thing it's missing is a Newgrounds logo. It's a well-made game, but most of the levels are just user-made garbage with lots of unfair traps and the physics can be wonky at times. I also got the occasional crash.Buy this on sale only; it's worth about 3 bucks in my opinion. It's got a good amount of content and the concept is entertaining, but in spirit it feels like any other Box2D Flash game that has been flooding the Internet for free since 2006,			",484,161,11,42,40,3,29

												It's not that Snuggle Truck is bad per say, it's just...not very good.Taking the Trials HD side-scrolling rollercoaster arcade racing formula, adding a basket of fluffy stuffed animals, and polishing off any of the more challenging or demanding bits, it's biggest fault is just how obnoxiously boring it is. Its personality is lost in a deluge of repetitive, tedious levels, designed in such a way as to be just obnoxious and tedious enough that they become a monotonous chore to complete. The challenge feels mostly arbitrary and poorly planned out, existing as little more than to cause you to replay levels numerous times but providing no satisfaction when you finally achieve a faster time or medal.I wish I had some more elaborate criticism to add, but that's honestly all I can muster. Snuggle Truck feels like the cute but entirely moronic cousin of games such as Trials and Joe Danger, full of bright colors and upbeat music, but hard to spend more than a few minutes with before you can feel your eyelids start to close.

The graphics were just wonderful, all those fluffy little ♥♥♥♥s just looked fabulous and the physics in this game were just superb to what real life has to offer. Another well executed asset to this game was the DLC, you can quickly and easily customize your game to whichever playstyle you prefer. Want to be a patriotic American saving starving African children? You can, now, only on Snuggle Truck. I highly recommend buying twelth copies of this game, and just play the night away, I promise you, your ♥♥♥♥ will burst into flames and you won't regret it. Just come prepared with a couple dozen bottles of lube.			",72,6,1,10,10,0,13

												The mechanics are solid, there is depth in terms of content, and the execution is superb. I wouldn’t call this one a “thrill ride,” but Snuggle Truck can be your burst game, that title you play when you’ve got three minutes to spare.It’s hard to just peg Snuggle Truck in a genre. I call it a side-scrolling racing game and then toss in the caveat that it’s highly physics-based. In the game, you control a dirty truck that can be highly reactive to the terrain its meets -- the smallest dips and jumps cause the truck to lean back and forth. You can correct its arc with the arrow keys, but you don’t do it for the safety of the vehicle -- you get lined up to protect the cargo, those cartoon animals riding in the back. Each animal is just as reactive to the truck’s trajectory, and the point is to hit the end point as quickly as possible with as many animals as possible. Easier said than done, I've learned. There’s a lot of stuff that can get in your way in the process of getting to the end goal, the ""zoo"": there’s an assortment of bumps, massive hills, dips, and even a few surprise environmental objects like explosive crates that get thrown into the mix in later levels. For the most part, Owlchemy Labs does a fantastic job providing change of pace opportunities: there’s a ton of different layouts and jumps experimented with, which give you plenty to do and think about.Hitting and landing a jump without losing your animal dudes is all in the wrist and in the finger. You can use your keys to correct the trajectory and also use the basic movement mechanic -- pressing your fingers on either the up or the down key -- to slow or speed up your truck.Snuggle Truck introduces one new mechanic at a time, giving you the ability to slowly learn and react to obstacles as you progress through the levels. But there’s a big trial-and-error element as well since you never know what’s around the bend. One small jump, for example, can take you straight into a wall while another of the same exact kind might not present any mission critical navigational issues.To its credit, Snuggle Truck remains fun despite its clumps of middling level design. I chock this up to its relative snappiness -- levels take, generally, under a minute to finish, so it’s not a great loss to start over again. Nor do you really need to ace a level since there’s so many in each tier.Of course, there are carrots on sticks to chase -- Snuggle Truck goes heavy on the rewards after completion of each level. You can earn your traditional star medals, as well as completion medals based on completion and number of animals you save.While Snuggle Truck actually feels like a game that went one direction and then the other, I recommend it. The truck controls well, the physics respond well, and the level design has that right mix of snappiness and intrigue. Check it out if you’re in the market for another racing side-scroller, and keep your eyes peeled for updates. Owlchemy Labs has crazy plans for Smuggle Truck which include implementing community-generated levels which could lead to some awesome replay value.			",69,6,3,8,15,2,14

												Snuggle Truck is quite possibly the greatest game ever made. From an objective standpoint, nothing else comes quite close to delivering the kind of experience that this game is capable of. If I were to choose one game in existence to prove to somebody that video games are art, it would definitely have to be this masterpiece.Firstly, I would like to begin this review by asking the question: what is a video game? Some people would simply answer this by saying that video games are an interactive medium with the sole purpose of delivering entertainment to the players. Others prefer to give long philosophical answers which tackle every facet of this age-long riddle. After playing Snuggle Truck I can honestly say that any answer to this question is meaningless, and one only needs to play this game to fully appreciate the marvellous wonder of this pastime known as ""video games.""With that said I would like to break the game down as much as possible within the limitations of purely text-based reviews; after all Snuggle Truck is a deep, complex experience which would transcend standard, traditional review formats. One of the most notable things I would like to bring to the forefront is Snuggle Truck's graphics and visual style. When I first loaded this game and began playing, I thought the game had crashed. Let me explain: I'm an avid fan of trucking in general, and as a result my desktop background is a constantly-changing slideshow of truck imagery. The visuals in this game are so incredible that I mistook graphical images for photography. The animation is also so incredibly smooth and lifelike that I actually started to feel brief motion sickness after only a few seconds of play.This soon passed however as I quickly became immersed in the truly innovative and revolutionary gameplay found in this work of art. Snuggle Truck takes similar games such as Euro Truck Simulator 2 and completely slaps them in the face with its own brand of hyperrealistic physics and gameplay scenarios which leaves a completely before-unseen impression on the player. Because of how intuitive, responsive and predictable the controls felt, I was very quickly able to adapt to how the game must be played; and it even left me thinking ""hot damn, this is so lifelike, I could probably do this in a real life truck.""That's not to say the game is easily played, however. While the game presents itself as being extremely accessible through its  controls and simplstic gameplay objectives, this game has a very steep difficulty curve which constantly demands the player to step up their game. The difficulty is fair and never feels artificial, and if you mess up, it's 100% your fault.The audio in this game is beyond noteworthy. No lie, when I finished playing this game because I had important things to do - such as sleep so that I would have enough energy the next day to play more Snuggle Truck - I basically had to leave the game idling on the title screen because the music is so incredible. It's insanely catchy and would make great classical composers of past ages such as Bach and Mozart weep with envy.With everything said, I believe it stands to reason that Snuggle Truck should be considered one of if not the greatest game ever made. If, after reading this review, you still have any doubts as to whether or not you should buy this game, you are probably literally Satan; though I doubt even the dark lord himself wouldn't get a kick out of this truly magnificent magnum opus.

Now Steve is on the road and his house is on fire (unrelated).Like any normal guy, Steve likes to drive around with his stuffed animal collection in the back.

												This has got to be one of the most beautiful, artistic games I've ever played. Not only is it positively morally influencial on the new generation by saving cuddly animals, in a modest transport vehicle. What differentiates Snuggle Truck from the other modern games, is the generous lack of over-sexualised women. Over-sexualised women in today's videogames is what's ruining the industry, and this is a breath of fresh air from the otherwise disgusting misogynist priviledged men in our videogame world. Snuggle Truck is a gender-friendly game that I highly reccomend you let your children play, and even you play!

												Snuggle Truck is a relatively fun casual deliver x stuffed animals in x time game. It has a nice amount of content, levels and an awesome editor meaning the community can make levels giving an unlimited amount of playable content. However, the game itself has too many minor errors making it not worth the hassle and here is why:Pros: ♦ Decent Graphics and Sounds (These are alright for what it is, they are not amazing but fit the game)♦ Medal Concept is Great (Unlocking medals for completing x goal in a level is nice as it gives you something to do in the level and adds a nice amount of content to the level)♦ Gameplay is fun and works with minimal glitches (Driving through the level and delivering x stuffed animals in x time just works. It is pretty fun if you are the type that likes to be number one on the leaderboards and must complete all level challenges. If you don’t like playing a game for leaderboards or completing challenges, then you probably won’t find this as fun as I did)♦ Easy to 100% with Achievements (Has a nice number of easy Achievements which are mainly unlocked by just using features of the game and completing the game)♦ Steam Trading Cards (This is always a bonus)♦ Each level design is unique (This is nice as every level feels different and no two levels feel as though it is a repetitive copy of the last level)♦ Decent level editor (Amazing level editor that allows anyone to create a level and upload for anyone to play. This is an awesome feature as it adds an potentially unlimited amount of levels and content to the game)♦ Truck and Stuffed Animal skins are very detailed (Custom Skins are designed very well for what they are and add a nice little bonus to the game)♦ Price is reasonable ($5 for a game is decent as if you look past all the cons you’ll get your $5 worth)Cons:♦ No Steam Cloud Storage (I’ve had to restart this game 3 or 4 times for the sole fact of no Steam Cloud Storage and me always losing my save file. You could say I should’ve backed up the savefile, but there is no easy way to tell which games you own have SCS. Therefore, as the game progresses by completing one level to unlock the next, SCS would be relatively beneficial. Plus, If a game is on Steam and doesn’t make use of this free feature, then in my opinion it shouldn’t be on Steam)♦ Method to activate custom skins is annoying (Firstly to be able to even use them you have to go and enable them in a “+more” menu. The “+more+ menu doesn’t lead on to what it is until you click it which is annoying as I had no idea what It was until I clicked it. Though, once you’ve enabled all the custom skins, you have to then get into a level and click the truck until your truck has the skin you want. This concept would be fine if it didn’t mean you had to waste a play through just to enable a skin. The skin should be able to be enabled and selected from within the “+more” menu)♦ Lacks Steam Workshop (This is bad as the game makes you upload to their servers and for some reason created levels don’t always stay. I say this as I created a level a while ago and started playing Snuggle Truck again only to find my level deleted. Plus, custom levels not moderated properly as the only way is by a star rating which doesn’t explain much. With Steam Workshop levels would be moderated by the community via ratings and comments etc and would be more likely to stay in the game) ♦ Has DLC activated automatically (This is a weird concept as the game calls certain features DLC but you can’t actually buy any DLC for the game. This confuses me as to why it’s even called DLC)♦ Custom level highscores don't load and you have to quit the game to continue playing (When you click the highscores in Custom levels made by users, it just shows a spinning loading circle and does nothing else. You can’t close out of the spinning loading circle, meaning you have to close the game and re-open it if you want to continue playing)♦ No way to delete a Downloaded Custom Level (This is annoying as I stated not all levels are moderated. Therefore, if you download a bad level there is no way to easily delete it within the game. This is annoying as it fills your list of custom levels with a lot of potentially unwanted ones making it hard to find the ones that you actually enjoyed and work)♦ Has impossible times in highscores rendering them broken (Highscores just work, however some scores are obviously impossible and hacked in some way. There needs to be some sort of moderation of highscores or a global reset to make number one even achievable)♦ Pressing escape to go back to the main menu at times loses the mouse cursor making the menu unusable (This is annoying as not being able to use the mouse on a menu means you can’t actually select anything. This ultimately means you have to close the game and re-open it to continue playing)♦ Alt+Tab brings up a pause menu that doesn’t act properly (When you press Alt+Tab and return to the game it brings up a pause menu, which is nice ingame but out of game on the menu it still comes up and trying to return to the game or close this menu doesn’t function properly)♦ Makes use of Steam Global Leaderboards via Steam Stats but they don’t function (This is a nice feature to have, but for whatever reason there are no entries in these leaderboards and one of the level entries is “Test” which shouldn’t be the case)Overall, even though gameplay seemingly works and is fun, the game is cheap and has a decent amount of content, I can’t recommend this game. I can’t recommend it because there are too many minor errors within features of the game that should have been eliminated in early beta stages. Plus, having no cloud storage is a big factor for me not to recommend a game like this.			",672,123,27,64,39,10,79

												I had never even seen a shooting star before. 25 years of rotations, passes through comets' paths, and travel, and to my memory I had never witnessed burning debris scratch across the night sky. I stared entranced, soaking in owlchemy Labs' new material, chiseling each gameplay moment into the best functioning parts of my brain which would be the only platform for the material for months.This is an emotional, psychological experience. Snuggle Truck plays like a clouded brain trying to recall an alien abduction. It's the sound of a development studio, and its leader, losing faith in themselves, destroying themselves, and subsequently rebuilding a perfect entity. In other words, Owlchemy Labs hated being Owlchemy Labs, but ended up with the most ideal, natural game yet.The experience and emotions tied to playing Snuggle Truck are like witnessing the stillborn birth of a child while simultaneously having the opportunity to see her play in the afterlife on Imax. It's a game of sparking paradox. It's cacophonous yet tranquil, experimental yet familiar, foreign yet womb-like, spacious yet visceral, textured yet vaporous, awakening yet dreamlike, infinite yet two hours long. It will cleanse your brain of those little crustaceans of worries and inferior games clinging inside the fold of your gray matter. The harrowing sounds hit from unseen angles and emanate with inhuman genesis. When the headphones peel off, and it occurs that six men created this, it's clear that Owlchemy Labs must be the greatest developer alive, if not the best since you know who. Breathing people made this game! And you can't wait to dive back in and try to prove that wrong over and over.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like games with cute graphics, catchy music and simple fun gameplay you could do much worse than this. With only accelerate, decelerate and tilt as your controls, the objective is to take your truck through an obstacle course without allowing your cuddly toys to fall out. I really like it. It's the kind of game you can play for 5 minutes and then put down, and the upbeat music puts a nice big grin on my face. What more can you ask for?			",112,28,4,7,4,0,9

												Buyer beware Cuteness overload may cause diabetes and unfathomable desire for plushy squeeks.After this went on sale for only just a dollar there is no reason not to get it.It has very simple concept to keep your truck steady as you race towards the goal with plushys intact through various obstacles. The game difficulty gradually increases with each tier level to the point where my OCD to achieve all medals becomes rage inducing. Soon I found playing this game in small doses was for the best.Overall Its a must buy for anyone that wants to kill a little time its a game to play inbetween games.			",72,8,1,3,3,0,1

												Truly one of the greatest games of our time, Snuggle Truck holds within it's fluffy outer shell a deep metaphor. Humanity's time on earth is fleeting and the vehicle with which we are transported on is the Earth. Snuggle Truck really teaches people how much work the Earth has to do to keep us from flying out of the back of itself and into space. Clearly it is using a lot of rocket powerups as only a net could hold billions of people back. I think we should buy Snuggle Truck to tell the world we care about what it does to make sure we aren't thrown into the vacuum of space.			",120,27,15,25,19,2,28

												I can't really say Snuggle Truck is worth playing on anything apart from a mobile device. There is no point to this game being on PC since it would be perfect on IOS. The aim is to finish an obsticle course in the quickest time while also carrying lots of ""snugglies"" in your trunk, so there is alot physics involed in not letting your truck tip over.The game only explains the keyboard controls, however you can play with an xbox controller (and I recommend you do, if you play it). User created levels will add replayability here,  but don't waste your time  playing.			",1544,456,43,234,159,12,209

												Snuggle Truck is a game on Steam that was previously a flash game called ""Smuggle Truck"", a game commenting on the trials of immigration to the United States from Mexico. This is a narrative thread with satirization that works quite well.Snuggle Truck is about transporting stuffed animals to the zoo, which makes for incredibly confusing commentary. First of all, where are the stuffed animals trying to escape from? Are they escaping from the bedrooms of a particularly stultifying suburb? Suburb living is the safest, blandest living there is to offer in the United States. Are they going to Burning Man or something?No, they are going to the zoo. For some reason. Why? Are you playing as an international stuffed animal trafficker? What kind of demented mind steals teddy bears and stuffed elephants from the bedrooms and playplaces of children everywhere to take them to the zoo? What is to be gained from this action, especially when there are real animals to look at and already existing stuffed fascimiles to buy fresh from the gift shop at manufacturer suggested retail prices? THIS GAME MAKES NO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SENSE AND THE MESSAGE IT OFFERS TO THE PLAYER IS ♥♥♥♥ING CLOWNSHOES.It is a solid physics flash game and it'll entertain you for twenty minutes before it starts to get boring. BUT IT MAKES NO SENSE.			",448,99,7,53,31,2,53

												What a fantastic kids game! Found myself getting addicted. I will need to get my kids to get the harder levels completed for me LOL, I dont have the skillz.This is actually called 'SMUGGLE TRUCK', description taken from the website;http://smuggletruck.com/Smuggle Truck was inspired by the frustration our friends have experienced in trying to immigrate to the United States. With such a troublesome issue being largely avoided in popular media, especially video games, we felt the best way to criticize it was with an interactive satire.In Smuggle Truck, players are driving a truck with passengers in the back, bringing them over a fictional border. This idea originated as a result of learning that the process of legal immigration was not as straightforward as we had assumed. As we lived through a painful 12 months of our friend struggling through the absurd legal minefield that surrounds U.S. immigration, we felt that we should create a game that touches on the issue. The comment was thrown around that ""it's so tough to legally immigrate to the U.S., it's almost easier to smuggle yourself over the border"", and thus Smuggle Truck was born. A two-day prototype eventually turned into an iPhone game, with the plan to reach as many players as possible.Throughout the creation of the game, we maintained a meticulous eye to avoid depicting a specific stereotype or location, instead opting to generalize smuggling to its most basic abstract form. Through user testing and feedback from fellow developers and even random strangers, we worked to maintain a light and humorous representation of a subject that is normally avoided.With a satirical angle on a real issue, we want to create a game that is fun to play but also stirs up discussion on ways to improve the problematic immigration system in the United States.C'mon STEAM where is the smuggle DLC?

Basic controls: W,A,S,D and space bar make it easy to pick up. Great to kill some time and the carnival type of music gets your head bobbin'.

												Snuggle Truck is a strange little game that I purchased because I was dumb enough to buy something simply because it featured something related to something completely different.  That is not to say that it was necessarily a bad decision in the end, rather something that I have learned not to do.  None the less.The game is a simple physics game requiring you to get from point A to point B while still keeping your cargo inside of your truck.  There isn't really much more to it than that.  It's a bare bones game that is great when you feel like having some stupid fun, but is definitely something that could use a little more polish.  It gets boring if you play too much of it at once.  I suppose in the end it is worth the price of $5.00.Also, for those curious of the origin of the name, the game was originally named Smuggle Truck and required you to bring foreigners past the border.  See, learning can be fun!			",212,48,4,29,17,6,38

												Snuggle Truck is a physics-based driving game where you must deliver your cargo full of ""Snuggies"" as fast as possible to the zoo.  On your travels you will encounter various obstacles and will have to overcome them with the various power-ups that you are provided with.Snuggle Truck's gameplay is decent, and can be challenging if the player wants to unlock all the medals the game has to offer. However the game has definitely lost character since its late production change from ""Smuggle Truck"" to ""Snuggle Truck"".  Rather than using a rundown pick-up truck to smuggle immigrants over the border you have to transport stuffed animals to a zoo in a similar fashion. In other words, they are both the same game. Overall, Snuggle Truck is an average game which has sadly had its unique concept ripped out from underneath it via censorship of Apple. Like many games of this nature it is great for those that are looking to lose a few minutes. I would recommend ""Smuggle Truck"" instead as I believe this is the game that Owlchemy Labs wanted their audience to experience. You can only access the original from their website.

												What can one say about Snuggle Truck that hasn't been said about life's great events? This ranks right up there with those big life moments. First haircut, first heartbreak, graduation, marriage, your first child, first death of a loved one.  Roll those all up together and you barely begin to touch the pure awesomeness that is Snuggle Truck! It's saved suicidal people, it's ended criminal and terrorist standoffs. It's brought comfort to the weary and hope to the hopeless. If you ever needed proof that the Universe is actually a benign, loving place than Snuggle Truck will make you believe!

												A simple racing/physics game.Your goal is to get one or more stuffed animals to the finishing line (with a raising flag a la Mario) in the shortest time possible.The simple premise is good, but the art/sound direction leaves a lot to be desired. Words cannot describe how irritating it is to listen to those pesky stuffed toys' squeaks. My goal quickly changed to tossing those animals on the ground then to roll all over them, back, and forth, back, and forth.Overall, there's not that many levels, but the last ones are quite challenging. Then you can also create your own levels with the built-in level editor, and even download levels made by other players.			",951,375,26,138,93,10,183

												This is a game, that somehow got into my steam library through some bundle i purchased.  I decided I might as well give it a go, and I am glad I made that decision. In this simple to play, yet hard to master game you are in the role of a truck driver, who is driving a truck filled with stuffed animals. Your goal is to get from one side of the map to the other in the shortest amount of time, losing as little animals as possible. Each level takes about 30 seconds to complete, but you get addicted to completing them one after another and before you realize it, a whole day has passed by. The levels are split into 4 groups or easy, medium, hard and extreme. There are 5 medals you can collect in every level, and you need these medals to unlock more difficult levels. The game soon turns into a very fun grind experience, as you replay the same level over and over again attempting to beat the time record or safely deliver the animals to the end. But that doesn't mean the game becomes boring, in fact it even becomes more interesting, and due to the cute nature of the stuffed animals you don't really get too frustrated with your failure. Overall, I think this game is a real hidden gem and is worth the original price (but it still might be wiser to get it at a discounted price if you are unsure if you like this kind of game) I give it a 7.3/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Snuggle Truck is a physics-based 2D racing game, much like Trials. You have two goals: get to the goal as quickly as possible, and keep as many stuffed animals in the back as possible. To complete the stages, you need to perform both tasks well enough, with more rewards for a speed run or a perfect run. I found it to be a lot of fun. Getting through the levels with both speed and grace is an entertaining challenge.The truck controls decently well and the art is vibrant, though the sound is a ittle obnoxious. The game doesn't seem to have the same skill/strategy depth as Trials, but there is quite a lot to do, and getting through the harder levels can be very difficult. I found that this game is best played in short sessions (though, for later levels, a short session may not be enough time to accomplish much).If Snuggle Truck looks at all interesting to you, it will be well worth your five dollars.

												It's like a well-made flash game that gives about half an hour of fun. Once you start achievement whoring it's not so fun though, because the physics can feel very unpredictable. Nothing is more frustrating than thinking you've done everything right only to lose all your cargo because you hit a quirk in the physics.Ultimately the novelty is fun for a short while, but any further than that and the charm wears off fast. I got it in a bundle and I still wouldn't recommend it for any price.(Also the reason why my play time is so high is because the game wiped all my save data when I only had about 10 or 20 medals left, so I had to start over.

												Snuggle Truck is a straightforward but fun physics puzzler. You've got a truck, there are things to snuggle in it, and you've got to keep it that way. Unfortunately, the rest of the world seems out to prevent that, as harmless as it sounds. The bulk of the gameplay is managing the bounce of your plush toy cargo since you couldn't be bothered to invest in a net or a closed truck bed, which is surprisingly more fun than it initially seems.The risk/reward balance of Snuggle Truck is such that the game becomes a great deal more engaging than you'd expect. The first few levels, you'll screw up a few times, but learn what bounces where and how to recover when it does. As things ramp up, however, you start actually caring a bit about how many snugglies you deliver, until the game sucks you in for more levels than you expected. It's not super deep, but it's enough to keep you going for a session. You can also try your hand at making levels if design is more your jam; there are already tons of them out there, so you'll never be at a shortage for things to complete.I'd say Snuggle Truck is worth it as a pick up and play title to keep tucked in your game library for downtime or when you need a good distraction. It's unlikely to rock your world, but it's hard to hate.			",836,398,38,114,89,9,112

												You will find yourself laughing each time these innocent animals fly from the back of your truck.  It's really fun!   There is also a Brony mode.  What else could you ask for?			",300,185,5,23,34,6,40

												Though it seems to be a simple, fun and light-hearted game; after hours of play you discover it's anything but.Eventually you come to a gripping realization: This is man vs. enviorment in its purest form. You're the only one who can deliver the goods, your plushy cargo is key to your sucess, treat it with care and you shall be rewarded.Highly entertaining.Go forth my brethren and ride your snuggle truck into the sunset.

												A delightfully fun physics-based game.  Don't let the name fool you; while it may seem like a game for children, it can get ridiculously difficult at times.  This game can certainly entertain you or a group of friends, no matter the age.			",198,58,2,21,8,3,10

												A simplistic mobile game with awful controls. PROS:-Graphics are amusingCONS:-Controls are awful and heavily oversteer (in a game with 4 buttons total that is all about speed runs and control...)-Mobile game-Awkward, exaggerated physicsThe game itself is extremely simple: you accelerate your truck (going from left to right) with a bunch of animals loose in the back. As you hit bumps, jumps, etc, you have to even out so the animals dont fall out of the back of the truck. Sounds simple, but due to over-exaggerated physics and awful controls this one leads to a frustrating experience. The ""Easy"" levels were enough for me.			",383,122,8,34,26,3,50

												I love this game, its a mixture of old school mario simple level design layouts with 2D racing elements. It is a ton of fun and a good way to kill time as well. It might seem like a game that only appeals to the younger crowd but I have to tell you, the levels get really challenging and you really have to be good to get the silver medals let alone the gold medals on the harder difficulty's. The game also has a ton of content, it will take even the most hard core snuggle players to get gold on every level with each teddy bear saved. I give this game a 4/5 with my only gripe that this game should have multiplayer.			",95,23,3,8,5,0,9

												From what you see from the screenshots on the Steam Store to the in-game thrill, throughout the game you gain love for the game and later forget that you're in a truck collecting teddy-bears which will later lead to advancing in levels and earning medals etc. Yes, it sounds baby-ish and maybe a little bit weird but hell no! Jump in the truck and grab them bears.10/10 Snuggle-Truck <3On a serious note, the game is actually pretty good! The name of the game is admittidly weird and in my opinion it's a little mis-leading. If it wasn't named as it is then I believe this would be a lot more popular. Must buy. ;)			",23,5,1,1,4,0,5
