												Junk - not worth the price of FREE.I'm a huge star wars fan, and this is not worth my time.  It's a Nissan Ad with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 360 degree (NOT 3D) Star Wars video around it.  Roughly 1 minute long.			",181,60,4,9,10,4,12

												Two patches and 1.5 GB later and don't see any picture on HTC vive. Only Desktop window showing 360' video 1,5 minute long that stutters like hell. Like come'on, this must be a joke. Learn from Invinity VR. Don't bother to download.			",188,51,10,8,30,3,26

												I get to the first screen and then after that a black screen. Tried restarting my PC etc, but several other players reporting the same issue.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
