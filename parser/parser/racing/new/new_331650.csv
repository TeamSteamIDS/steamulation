												I just played the trilogy recently.  The 3rd one has problems.-They changed the control scheme on it.  ...Probably for the better, but still.-The Eagle doesn't feel quite as powerful in it as it did in the previous ones.  ...Which is again is probably for the better, since you basically never have to swap out the Eagle until late game in them.-The time limit maxes out at 4 minutes.  And not just ""maxes out the display"" and keeps rolling, but actually taps out at 4 minutes.  THIS is my biggest complaint with it.  You are basically forced to keep going in it, you never get a chance to really sit back and explore.  I like exploring the levels.  Pedestrians also give you almost no time.-The missions.  They were every other level here, not every 4th level like in the previous game.  They also... I dunno, mostly were uninspired?  They're not bad, but they seemed to be fairly bland, particularly early on.  They are hit and miss overall.Two other issues:  This game includes the Nosebleed Pack.  Now, it's nice in that ""more cars, more maps, more content!""  However, these vehicles are not well balanced, and are available from the beginning.  And are available in the opponent's pool from the beginning.  And the hovering car can be very, very annoying to deal with.Another issue is that the game crashes on story missions.  This is a known issue.  There is a workaround.  The workaround is to turn off the mip filter.  HOWEVER, due to another glitch, that being badly coded menus where the content doesn't contain itself to the windows, you can't actually turn off the mip filter in game.You CAN do it from the setup though.  So open the setup, go to options, video, advance, and where you see ""Mip filter"", set it to none.  You may also need to disable Pixel Fog (though I didn't need to).  This should fix the problem.There's a lot to like about the third game though.  The graphics are a big step up.  The final levels in this game really look fantastic.  The story IS there, even if it's annoying at times.My favorite of the bunch is the second.  The third has problems.  So, why am I giving this a ""yes"" recommendation, despite all the flaws, including crashes?  Because, at the end of the day, it's still Carmageddon.  And if you need to get your fix, there ya go.

												Nobby (lead dev of carmageddon)  wont like hearing this, but I actually liked this game. Sure, it was Carmageddon 2, it was just another game slapped on the Carma franchise, but as a Kid, I didnt mind, Even though STEAM shows 10 mins or so played, I have finished this game 2-3 times when it first came out. its a lot of fun if you let of the fact that its not a CARMA 3, its an destrruction derby game...

												I played this game a years ago, I've also played the original Carmageddon and other sequels as well as Carmageddon Reincarnation. I got this for free because I own the latter. I just booted this up for 15 minutes last night to check it out after all this time and do a quick video on the game.

In my mind my memories of this game looked a lot better graphically, 3D models are awful lol This didn't stop me enjoying the game though! (even now).If you don't already know this is car racing game. You can finish matches by completing a number of laps around courses. But Carmageddon's thing is running people over. You get points for it and extra time. Which sounds god damn awful lol but it's not as bad as it sounds when you play the game (btw I played these mostly when I was a kid - Carmageddon taught me all about life lol).Carmageddon TDR 2000 has aged but is still fun to play.

												Amazing game. When I was like 10 years old I did not like that game, because Carmageddon 1 and 2 looked for me way better, but later I realized that this game is great in every aspect:+Soon to be 20 years old this game has amazing graphics and back in old days, it was beautiful.+Various cars to play and upgrades: ofcourse the default car is the best and easiest to play, but you can buy all the other cars you play vs - even the boss! And try to beat the game with them.+Various difficulties - which are really different, the hardest one provide boss units at the early levels, can you imagine?+Beat the game various ways - kill enough pedestrians, destroy all the enemies or win the race.+Dark postapocalyptic atmosphere and color schemeInteresting campaign for a racing game provides loads of fun. This game is old AF yet its better than a lot of modern games. And if you manage to find an old PC to run it properly or tweak it enough to run on the modern one, you will have a lot of good time.

												carma games were always dear to my heart. The races were jus plain fun for the fact you didnt have to race if you didnt want to. However the missions could be very challenging. I wouldent recommend this game to anyone too serious as this is not a serious game, It is serious fun. Multiplayer is awesome fun. Missing the soundtrack however somewhat disappointing. I would recommend this game to anyone  whos never tried it . Its a smashing good time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am glad to see this game on Steam. I used to play this back when lan parties were a thing, back in the days of 2004. Me and my mates would run that map with the 4 spires and the grinder in the center, and we would spend hours just trying to get the nukes on the top of the spires. Kangaroo on Command man, that ♥♥♥♥ was the bomb.Anyway, back to my review. The game crashes from time to time, which is to be expected from such an old game. I'm gonna try forcing DirectX 9 mode on it, and starting up with -nod3d10. If the developers could give us some tips on how we could circumvent DirectX issues... that would be lovely.10/10 game. Anyone who tells you its ♥♥♥♥ probably hasn't played past The Boulevard.EDIT: Dont use -nod3d10, its not supported. Sad face.			",114,14,0,8,7,1,4

												While many people hate this and say that this is the worst carmageddon, I don't agree. Back when it came out for me it was great succesor to carmageddon 2. I really liked its atmsophere, level design and postapocalyptic setting. Well it was a long time ago and then these graphic's looked ok and I imagined these cities filled with weird slum people. The only area where it lacks comapred to carmageddon 2 is the damage physics, because in tdr theay ar pretty weak. There is car spliting and stuff but it just doesn't work that well. Improvements over original carma:Wheels fall of-Ped attack you with dynamite and molotows, there are also baricades built by them on some rodas-Cops only come if you start waisting you oponents and I gues when you kill many peds and if you are really bad thay call the suppressors :]-There are cool new powerups: Wheel spikes, hower car witch also lets you hower above the watter, meteor storm, nuclear bomb.- Level design (grim cities acompanied by trippy sounds really makes great atmosphere)- Pretty good tracked whicle technology for its time- Backstory (its minimal, but makes you imgaine things about the world yourself)- Bouncing boobs animationNote:If your game crashes wjile loding missions, disable mip filter.

												If you are a fan of the original games on the PC then this will probably not hit the mark. The collisions have no real substance to them, the graphics are almost cartoon like and overall it just feels like a safe for kids version of the classic carmageddon. Good for 5min but it has none of the originals charm and I doubt I will spend hours trying to eliminate the drives in an attempt to win there cars like I used too. In fact I just finished the race on my first run before turning it off... Bad item layout, not enough pedestrians, cartoon like graphics, stupid pop off armor and the maps just feel smaller and not as well designed.

												Carmageddon TDR 2000 is a fun game,once you become acustomed to its idiosynchrocies.  Most modern computers experience a glitch caused by an antiquated Mip map and vertex fog better handled by Voodoo Rush and TNT Riva cards of yesteryear.  The fix is simple: backup your game cache through Steam first. browse Local Files, Open GFX file with Word Pad. Scroll to line 74 and edit line which reads all twos. Change last two to a zero, Save and done. The game has 25 races and 25 missions. For help with missions check out ZodApe's YewTewb Channel. I have seen complaints on here about the game is broken,too hard,not enough time etc.  Yet i imagine these same complainers plow happily throught the latest NFS broken crap because the Dice Team made it and they made Call of Droopy Diaties. Blow that!  Need more money to buy that sweet Hotty? Try racing the first level in The 20's and for the love of Pete,mow down every ped on the sidewalks. Keep  those Combo Multiplies spinning and you will make serious bank ~ $250K - $600K per play through.  Race it over and over until you have serious ends. Also the Train Station generously has Armor,Power and Slots All Around so you need not buy those,merely fill them for more even more nefarious power. Do You need more time? Use a bigger and slower car to hammer the competition. The ""Jaws"" car is a personal fave. Most Opponent Wasteds yield an extra minute and sometimes more added game play time.  Is this game for everyone? Hell no! You have to work hard to succeed. Without some skin in the game there can be no reward. This is a game from fifteen years  past when games were brutal but satisfying because you felt like you had accomplished something. if it is too hard then maybe Mario Kart or one of it's Brawzillion spinoffs is a better bet for you. Thanks for reading,be safe,keep well and happy gaming Playa.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Carmageddon is probably one of the most enjoyable racing games i have ever played.Don't get me wrong, yes, Forza looks good. Yes, Flatout has fun damage and somewhat realistic, yes, micromachines has weapons, but with this game the whole atmosphere makes it enjoyable. Yes! The graphics are bad! Yes, the sounds are terrible and are extremely loud! But who cares! This game was released in 2000! That was a year before the first Xbox! AND STILL THIS GAME IS MORE ENJOYABLE THEN GAMES COMING OUT ON THE XBOX ONE AND PLAYSTATION4!Get this game. Play it with your friends.

												About 15 years ago, i was newly curious and exploring computer games as a kid. I made the usual trips to the computer games isle in the Tagret my family frequented. This one time, something caught my eye from an endcap while leaving the games isle. It was the jewel case US version. It looked dark and cool, comparitively to what was on the shelves back then. I asked my mom if she would buy it for me, and she obliged.The boxart was punk looking and i was into that phase a the time. Crimson red, with chrome lettering. The screenshots on the back were fascinating.This was my introduction to to the Carmageddon franchise, and community. At the time, it was not so regarded as a turd, at least not so openly by the original devs, but i had no idea of the politics at the time regardless. It was fun. The physics were spot on, collisions were impactful, the vehicles were creative and creatively ripped off from things i'd seen in movies and tv shows of the time, some before my time.The music, was just what i was into at the time. Odd, punk and metal. I still play the soundrack that i ripped from the disk back then, and thats my preferred way of listening to the music in game now that it isn't included in this version.The graphics were great, but this was the first title that i realized... i had a ♥♥♥♥ eMachine. This game was my introduction to learning why my computer was slow and what to do to make it faster, or learn what i would need theoretically to upgrade. It also taught me about modding communities and it blew me away that i could add things to these games. I downloaded everything i could find, 5-10kb/s at a time.... sometimes a car would take all night.Anyways, despite the devs taking a ♥♥♥♥ on, and disowning this game, its what lead me down the rabbit hole.Pros:Physics are great.Gameplay is full of carnage.Music is a good match.Mods and Add-ons (Max Pack).Variety of Environments and Cars.Technology was amazing for the time.Widescreen support (without 3D stretching; there are 2D textures and hud items that stretch).Cons:Glitchy as ♥♥♥♥ (just hitting an opponent or wall sometimes will crash the game).Missions can be irritating as ♥♥♥♥.Gets easier the more APO you gain.Weapons could have focused a little more on car to car projectiles.I'm just glad and grateful, despite hating this game, that the devs allowed it to be on steam at all (it's not on GOG).P.S.Toshiba-3 - you are still a rockstar!http://rr2000.toshiba-3.com/ ",554,30,65,24,50,4,58

												Firstly, as most people, i'm a huge Carma fan, playing the old school version(s) and the N64 versions (which if you ask me is the TRUE turd in the franchise) but this is one that i actually never played.  that being said, i've always heard that this was a bad game.  Now thanks to the devs of the new version, i actually get a chance to play the installmant that shouldn't be named....and i don't get it.  it does have an odd feeling to it, not a bad one albeit.  it runs really well on my specs and actually is quite fun to play.  most of the hate might be from the fact that it wasn't developed by stainless.  it looks slightly better than Carma 2 in terms of the 3d models and it does  show it age, but it is a excellent addition to my collection and as a fan of the game series, a welcomed chance to play something i missed way back when.  i do reccommend this game if you enjoy the carma 1 and 2.

SHORT VERSIONExpect:Frustrating missions, timer from hell, annoying cops, invisible barriers, PHYSICS!, tiny locales, OP car v car damage, tedious APO system, lots of cars (which you can't afford), accessibility ramps, computers on the roof, mutants, rampant jaywalking, lots of jumping over wallsDo Not Expect:Any feeling of accomplishment, to be able to win by killing all peds, um.. er.. PHYSICS!, a fair fight, an epic boss battle, any variety (despite appearances), a good story, humerous situations to share with friends, friends.LONG VERSIONIt was so tempting to give this game my reccomendation. I played it an awful lot when I was younger, and not knowing a lot else about Carmageddon at the time I really liked this game. Coming back to it after all these years I got to thinking that maybe I should have left the nostalgia as just that, but I craved the sense of fun this used to give me and I just couldn't see where I got it from.First of all, the game isn't terrible. Running people over and smashing into other cars is still largely taboo in driving games and so is still quite fun to do. It's the execution that lets this title down. The races are the standard Carma Kill all peds, kill all opponents or just finish the allotted number of laps, but it's not that simple. In TDR2000 the timer is most certainly NOT your friend. Want to hunt peds? Forget it. They take forever to kill and only yield a +2 second bonus which hardly offsets the 10+ seconds it took to finish them off in the first place. Want to waste everyone? Fine, but expect them to forget you exist half way through fighting (or in some cases, they don't even want to acknowledge you EVER existed at all.) Just want to race? HAH! Chasing checkpoints will run the clock down by the second lap.The truth of the matter is, in the races you APPEAR to be given the choice of how to complete them, but they always pan out in exactly the same way because you are constantly chronologically challenged and you pretty much have to waste at least one opponent to stand a chance of completing the event in ANY of the three possible ways.What else is on offer, you ask?  Well luckily if uniform race completion isn't for you then there are ""missions"". Missions like in GTA? Well... No. Sure you kill some people and race around trashing cars, but since you cannot actually LEAVE your vehicle, everything has to be possible to do whislt driving one. How do you access a computer? Why, just smash into the oversized console, of course! Need to destroy a mainframe? Well now, it's just sitting on the roof waiting to get trashed. Yes, THE ROOF. Somebody thought ""You know, the ROOF is a great place for this computer that controls base security. Not like somebody is going to ramp up there and knock it off... or it RAINS."" The placement of objectives that aren't just ""gang leaders"" to waste make you feel like you are using accessability ramps to get everywhere, like somebody thought ""What if a CAR wanted to get into this office? Did we set up the keyboard to show detailed secure files when a car drives into it?"". When the missions aren't being rediculous, they are being immensely frustrating and tedious. I understand that there is only so much you can do from the cockpit of a car beyond smashing into consoles or interfacing with rooftop computers, but there is very little variation beyond that. You end up wasting someone, collecting pieces of something scattered across the map, smashing peds or doing some crazy stunts to get to some unexplained point on a rooftop that defies reasonable explanation. PHYSICS. So much physics, it's just a shame that most of it is wrong, so very wrong. Invisible barriers. Yes, they are here, and they will wreck your ride and fail you some missions, because why not? If you're not getting beached on your own bodywork, you can bet you'll be getting beached on just about everything else. Vehicular weapons are great too, and in all fairness they do help, but wave goodbye to them as the slightest knock will detach them and any other piece of bodywork you hold dear, because in the TDR 2000 universe cars are not made of metal, precision welded and fastened to provide a sturdy shell for your car, no. Everything is held together with biscuits. Hit a bump in the road, and BAM those biscuits crumble and most of your bodywork is sailing away from you. Why am I complaining about this? Well, metal tends to deform when hit. It dents, it scratches, it tarnishes, it doesn't just fall away. Hell, it doesn't just fall away and then orbit you for about a hundred meters, pulling your car around and making it impossile to drive (I'm looking at you, ""The Vulture""). There are times when the physics do good. Drive your car fast enough into another car and/or crush it between two objects and it will bend, or sometimes, very appealingly, split in half entirely. Rare, but very satisfying when you use your afterburner to turn your car into a high-velocity wrecking ball.Speaking of wrecking, a note on the APO (yes, it's back and more irrelevent than ever.) Upgrading your armour, power and offence seems like a great idea, until you realise you are just as slow as you were when you started, you are just as easy to waste and you are just as overpowered when ramming opponents/cops but you have NO MONEY LEFT. Seriously, save it for the cars, find one you like, they're all essentially the same except for King Merc (Much fun) and The Wheel (for when you want to spin around pointlessly unable to go in a straight line.) Go nuts. It really doesn't make a difference.Such destruction does often catch the attention of the police, but they are little more than a nuisance. Wasting them often proves easier than wasting some of your opponents, and they have no special weapons or abilities to make you think ""Oh, damn. The police. Better avoid them!""I can't leave this review as it is without at least touching upon the humour. Carmageddon is supposed to be about all-out crude crazy chaotic nonesense, and TDR 2000 has none of it. I realise this particular installment wasn't developed by the original team, but boy does it show. The pre-mission ""Cut-scene"" dialogues aren't even funny (even though they are begging to be) and the power-ups/stunt/collision one-liners are pale in comparision to what the original developers drenched the other installments in.Just wait 'til it's cheap. If you didn't get it free, that is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is perhaps one of the best carma games I've playade, but not without it's flaws.NOTE: I have not played Carmageddon: Reincarnation at the time of writing this, but i have played Carma 1, 2, and have beaten the mobile version.+ I love how the cars are more responsive than in Stainless's games, although it feels more fitting to drive a car with traction like it's on an ice rink.- It seems they had problems balancing timer refills; Unlike the other Carma games, you have to pace yourself a bit more. The timer is clamped at 5:00, so there isn't as much time to screw around on a map as the others. It also seems you get a mere couple extra seconds from mowing down 10-15 pedestrians compared to, say, a full minute, or 3, in previous games.+ The updated graphics are refreshing. They're a bit sharper than Carma2, and the pedestrians don't look as blocky. I'm no texture artist but I think custom car skin support is a nice touch, especially when the textures are exported for you when creating a new skin.+ Perhaps my favorite track is the racetrack, driving the wrong way and causing a pileup at 200mph is always funny. The splat pack environments are definitely unusual, and add a nice twist to the game.+ Missions are usually fun.- Missions get extremely repetitivetl;dr Carmageddon TDR 2000 is a great game, but time limits and missions feel a bit more serious than a Carma game should.

												It sucks. I know it sucks. Stainless think it sucks. It's pretty much a new set of developers taking a formula that works and screwing with it. It's like someone ♥♥♥♥ing with Led Zeppelin's instruments before they go out live on stage. And giving all the band members a collective brain embolism.The parts of the game where you do actual races against opponents aren't bad, but there's all these little tweaks in the formula that add up to the game not being as great as it should be. The missions themselves are the real turd in the punch bowl. Hey, who liked the missions from Carmageddon 2? Let's make half of our game that, but worse! Wait, no one liked them? And no one wanted a worse version of them? Hell with that, let's put them in anyway!As a final remark, I found Erik Wolpaw (he wrote Portal, Portal 2)'s review of this game.[www.gamespot.com] It's not an Old Man Murray review, but I think he does an alright job explaining what the game is.

												My fave Carmageddon...please don't hurt me. I really, really like this game. Yeah, I know...Race awesome looking cars in awesome diffirent locations while blasting cars and peds to bits. The most underrated game of all time imo. Absolutely fantastic. It has atmosphere similar to the originals, but even so is still far more vibey. Once you get past Bollowood and realize that you don't need to be careful with your car, that there's oppurtunity to gain more time everywhere and therefore is no longer a flaw as first thought and when you let the surprisingly huge atmosphere win you over, hopefully you'll realize just how bloody incredible this game is. I honestly believe it to be the most overrated game of all time. I adore it.Pros:+Great graphics for the year 2000 (compare it to Deus Ex, Thief II or any other game from 2000 and it smashes it graphically)+Lots of replayability+Nostalgia+Multiplayer LAN is really, really great+Awesome locations that get better as they go+Unique and interesting cars (a drivable wheel ffs)+Great humour+Missions are actually fun this time+Atmosphere to the Max+Unique asf+Sound design is absolutely fantastic+Cars actually handle unlike Max Damage+Kicks Max Damage and Reincarnation into a bloody mess and then runs over the mangled corpse a few times until the few brains those games had are now spinning around in TDR's wheelsCons:-Very glitchy, physics bugs out occasionally-4 min timer limit (an over exaggerated issue because it's barely a problem at all)-Music doesn't work for meSound: 8/10Graphics: 9/10 (in relation to the year)Gameplay: 9.5/10Content/Replayability: 8.5/10Overall: 9.5/10I love this game and will always love this game no matter what anyone says.

Obviously it is going to be different since it is the fourth game in the series and it has been made by a different f*cking developer... If anything I think this game is actually better in some ways than the previous games. It has a sh*t tone of vehicles that are actually unique with different handling, many different maps and missions to choose from, customizable vehicles (paint and upgrades), missions that actually show you what to do instead of you having to f*cking figure out everything you need to do. This game is decent. Still don't know why people are b*tching lel. F*cking fanboys say anything is sh*t if it's even slightly different.			",168,13,19,8,22,0,3

												The worst Carmageddon game. I'm not speaking relative either, it's a just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.A lot of the fun in Carmageddon comes from the fact that it lets you drive around like a jackass, running over innocents, destroying your competitors, or exploring the large tracks. That is removed in TDR 2000. It's miraculously stingy in awarding you time, you only get 2 seconds for each innocent killed, as opposed to 8 in the first 2. It may not sound like it's that big of a deal, but there are not as many peds  as in the Stainless games, and it rewards the same for ramming opponents, but it doesn't give you credit for it 80% of the time. It's so inconsistent it's infuriating, and in a game that's supposed to be ""free form"" all it does is force you to play it like a normal checkpoint chaser. Not to mention it runs like ♥♥♥♥ with every possible setup on a computer that exceeds it's recommended specs.The only thing this game actually does right is having a control scheme that let's you play on a craptop without needing xpadder.Only buy if you want all the Carmageddon games, otherwise stay away like it's Swine Flu. Buy one of the first 2 games instead.			",236,19,6,20,20,2,38

												Well lets start with a little backstory, imagine me about a decade ago, a teenager pining for the glory days of the original Carmageddon, where peds equal points and racing is for wimps, when lo and behold I found it.  A budget re-release copy of Carmageddon TDR2000, and at less than a fiver! I bought it instantly.  Maybe the fact that it's already a re-release title after a couple of years on the shelves should've had alarm bells ringing in my ears, but I bought it nonetheless, and after playing the first batch of races and missions I realised that this isn't the franchise I know and love, and by about halfway through I was bored and fed up with this game. After I completed it, I never touched it again.So what made this such a terrible gaming experience?  Lets start with the environments. At best they're mediocre, and the locations at least are as varied as the original game, but they also looked more dreary and washed out, and to be honest, rather uninspired. Also, althogh the game engine itself is fairly solid, I've got stuck on the level geometry enough times for it to be annoying.  As for the pedestrians that inhabit the maps, they would be satisfying to run over if they didn't all have adamantine skeletons.  I swear, unless you are going full pelt at them, you have to reverse back over them at least once in order to kill them (and even then it wasn't a guarantee!) If that wasn't bad enough the game only gives you a pittance of a time bonus for running them over. 2 seconds?! It took about that long to kill them in the first place!!!And the missions, oh god the missions!  Having one or two to break up the game is fine, but there were missions shoe-horned between every ♥♥♥♥ing race!  I just wanted to cause some carnage.  And if they weren't asinine fetch quests, they were convoluted and tedious, like shooting sharks with a slaughter mortar, which on paper sounds zany and fun, but in a vehicle can be awkward and frustrating to pull off.Then there are the cars themselves, all the rest might have been forgiven if the cars themselves were fun to drive, but they aren't.  They're ♥♥♥♥.  That in itself is a cardinal sin in ANY driving sim, let alone a Carmageddon sequel.To begin with, the line-up looks like an A-Z from a Poundland toys catalogue, Rangeing from the silly to the uninspired, with things like a motorized wooden hamster wheel, a pallid attempt at a steampunk monster truck, (which looks more like a boiler mounted on a horse cart,) a tank, nothing special, just a tank, and even a man driving a bathtub (really?), none of which fits the game's setting, bar one, Max's own Eagle, which you started with. Then there are those cars which goes beyond uninspired to just plain lazy: one of the cars is literally called ""Sports Sedan"", and is just that.  I watched a video of this game about a month ago and I couldn't tell the opponent vehicles from the rest of the traffic milling about on the map.  Needless to say you won't be tempted to drive every vehicle in the game.As for the handling it's okay for the most part, but a few vehicles refuse to turn from a standing start, some spin out like they have greased tyres, and then theres the novelty vehicles like the hovercar which is almost impossible to control and ends up adding nothing to the table in terms of gameplay.  I could go on about the gripes I have with the cars in this game (the damage modelling, the sounds, the physics...) but those are the biggest and as far as I'm concerned the worst.Now for the upshot.  Is it worth shelling out for this game? My advice is no.  There are better games (and sequels) out there that are worth paying for.  But what if despite its glaring flaws you still have fond, nostalgic memories from when you first played it, and want to experience it again. My advice is still no.  You can get this game and its two prequels for FREE if you buy Carmageddon: Reincarnation, which in my opinion is a far better investment, especially considering how well Reincarnation itself is already panning out.Sorry for the wall of text there, (it seemed shorter in my head) but tl;dr: Don't buy this game.

												This game sucked when it first came out and it still sucks.  Nostalgia doesn't make games suck less as years go by.  Go ahead and downvote this review but I'm still right.			",552,160,24,48,35,6,61

												Would be nice if I could actually get it to start up.Disabling everything, enabling everything. It started up once, then I closed it down to increase the resolution, from there on it decided to remain dead (Even after decreasing and re-installing etc.).			",123,10,2,18,13,1,22

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! This game is absolute ♥♥♥♥ and unplayable without cheats, which themselves dont work. The biggest problem is the time. You will only get time from killing opponents and racing through checkpoints, and even then only very little, not to mention the max time you can have is 5 minutes. Don't waste your time and money on this piece of ♥♥♥♥, and instead play Carma 2. I got this for free as a steam gift an i'm still ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about using time on it. Score: 23 out of 100			",100,3,2,9,6,0,16

												Eh, when i first played this i was pretty disappointed, but i guess i have to take into consideration that Torus made it.			",584,140,33,70,64,6,80

What I liked about the game 	Awesome looking vehicles to drive. You don't have to start off with Max's car; you get to choose from a few other vehicles.  	Some pretty awesome maps; like Hell and Hollywood. 	Some pedestrians attack you and your car.	There's a great variety of missions, most maps have 3 missions and 3 typical carmageddon like races.	Cops aren't a pain in the ♥♥♥ and aren't over powered.	Some memorable moments, especially at the end of the first map. There is also a mission were you get to drive a unique vehicle.    What I disliked or was disappointed with 	Buggy and glitchy; I fell out of the world in one of the maps. Some strangle things can happen as well with the collision with over vehicles and objects; like hitting a lamp post causing the car to shoot up into the air. 	I'm not keen on the collisions in the game, especially with things like; lamp posts, fences and etc. Running over pedestrians isn't as satisfying and sometimes they prove hard to kill; I wish the pedestrians were easier to dismember. Collisions with other vehicles aren't pleasant; sometimes it's hard to detach your vehicle from other vehicles.  Hitting other driver's vehicles on the sides and rear doesn't do that much damage. 	Some of the maps look similar.   	The timer only goes up to a maximum of 4 minutes. Running over pedestrians and smashing cars isn't as time rewarding. 	You can still upgrade your offence, defence and engine power, but I wish there was more customization; like with colours, decals and have actual upgrades you can physically see on the car.	Some of the missions objectives repeat one too many times; like collect parts to build something. Sometimes it's hard to know where to go in the mission levels. 	Boring and uninteresting story. Conclusion The game had some very good ideas, but unfortunately the collision is horrible; not so much with the vehicle to vehicle it's more vehicle to everything else. I only recommend this to hardcore fans of the series. If you are new to the series, play the first game or second game.  57/100  ",105,1,0,3,1,0,0

												One of those games with the amazing nostalgic feeling. I loved this game cause of free roaming. I'd always boot my computer up to see Carmageddon TDR 2000. That game where you ♥♥♥♥ up people for throwing molotovs at your car. In my rating, 10/10 for nostalgic and entertaining with the dumb AI.6/10 for Windows 8 performance. It will lag for no reason sometimes, idk what it is... >.>			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is my very first Steam review, as I feel the need to do this game justice. I play Carmageddon games since the demo of Carma 1 came out, all the way to TDR 2000, and still own the box versions. And of course I finished TDR 2000 many times and played it for dozens of hours, before Steam was even invented. This is the most hated Carmageddon game out there, even after the dissaster called Carmageddon: Reincarnation. But I never saw a real reason behind that, so I recommend this game to anyone who liked Carma 1 and 2, it's a decent game all around. Pros:+ Everything you might want from a Carma game is there+ Funny missions (much better than in Carma 2)+ Nice looking graphics that aged well+ The single player campaign is quite long and challengingCons:- too much missions for some- compatibility problems- less time in racesAbout the game:As a follow up to Carma 2, TDR adds even more missions, now after every race there is a mission. Some people never liked missions in Carma to begin with, but missions in TDR make much more sense than in Carma 2, have an actual story behind them, and some are quite hillarious. There is plenty of cars in TDR, but all of them are new, not a sinle good ol' ride from Carma 1&2. The new cars are good looking and most are fun to drive, but most people me included miss the old cars. All of the maps have a bit ""post-apo"" feeling to them which not everyone likes, but they are big enough and vary a lot.The visuals are a matter of taste, but I always loved the graphic. It is much more vivid and colorful game to look at that both it's predecessors. And in my opinion it stood the test of time very well.About compatibility I can only say that while I had some problems initially, now the game runs on Windows 7 absolutely without any problems.Carmageddon races always were time limited and you have to collect time by ""various carmageddon means"". In TDR the time you can collect is capped at 4 mins and you get a lot less time for everything, especially at higher difficulties. This makes the races more challenging, but it's a bit shame since you have a lot less time to explore the maps. This was probably the biggest issues I had with the game, but you can get used to it. My verdict is while Carmageddon 1&2 are better games overall, TDR 2000 is a good game that I would recommend to everyone who is interested in Carmageddon games. Why Stainless hates this game:All SCI ex-carma developers, headed by Noby, trash talk this game every time the have a chance. Why? Because they did not get to develop this game, and that's it. I don't know the story behind why this game was handed to Torus to develop instead of SCI, but Torus did a good job and I what Noby&rest are saying about them is just a disgusting slander. Would they made a better 3rd Carma game back then? Maybe, we'll never know. But after they made the excrement called Reincarnation, and then run away with our money, they don't get to say anything.

												People just hate on TDR2000 cause its the fasionable thing to hate, like Nickleback, Pewdiepie and Justin Bieber, and just like those three things you'll find most people havent got any real experience with it or reasons to hate it other than the thought in their head ""i'll be called out for not having an opinion on it"" or just because the rest of the Carma fans/Stainless deems it so. I got TDR2000 when i preordered Reincarnation (along with the classic ones) and i have to say TDR2000 gets a lot of undeserved flack, its a pretty fun game, just as fun as the others. i think its pretty awful and unprofessional of the Stainless devs to bash it like this on its store page, I'm sure the Devs at Torus Games worked really hard on this.

												A lot of people hate this game because it is not like the first two in the series. Personally, I really like what it is and thoroughly enjoy it. Especially the afterburner!			",72,9,3,0,4,0,3
