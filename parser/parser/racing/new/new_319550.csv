												If you lack in the FPS/shooter aim, or just need to get better reflexes this game is for you It's cheap, it's fast and it's a good time killer. Simple yet thrilling game. I like that it has in-game leaderboards and how it keeps me on my toes at all times. I wouldn't dare blink while playing though, this game requires some serious reaction skills.Unfortunately the game does not have much variation for music and that the entire game can be completed in under an hour. Of course this depends on your reaction skills. Those who have played and enjoyed Super Hexagon would definitely enjoy The Collider.			",510,105,14,50,36,2,73

The Collider is an extremely simple but also nicely entertaining game, focusing on racing at ever-increasing speed through a particle accelerator. Graphics are minimal but stylish and functional, sound is electronic and appropriate and the gameplay is simply fun. By finetuning mouse-speed it's possible to steer in the collider by making fine and controlled movements, which made me almost feel like being in that mad tube. The sensation of speed is cleverly reached, so mission accomplished.Just one - to me serious - flaw: the achievements are completely broken. Many people have already complained about this on the Community Forum, but up till now no solution has been offered yet. Some may get them, so may not. Weird.Edited: Thanks to the efforts of some players, a fix for the achievements has been found. Look at the discussion page, there is a thread called ""Achievements"", and the fix is being discussed there. It involves downloading a file from Microsoft, but it's nothing too complicated. The developers should have fixed this a long time ago, so I won't up my score for this.Overall score: 7/10			",289,156,5,32,35,4,67

												If you're looking to pay up to 2 dollars to add another ""perfect game"" to your Steam Profile in literally 30 minutes on your lunchbreak (my actual experience with this game), then I guess you should pick this up.Otherwise, once you've ""completed"" the game after reaching the oddly arbitrary ""1300"" speed threshold (1300 what? MPH? KPH? Scoville units?), there's just nothing else to do or any reason to keep playing it.I'd say the replay value is abysmal but it's actually absent.There's literally like a dozen (or maybe less?) of obstacles that pop up in front of you every now and then. I mean, I'm sorry, I meant to say that this game is ""procedurally generated"".The only other thing that's supposed to add an edge to the gameplay is the coins, which are pointless. You can only use them to buy continues, and since you can get the ""perfect/clean"" playthrough achievements in 30 minutes anyway, you don't really need the coins and they're merely a distraction.Verdict:Possibly the most forgettable game I've ever played on Steam.But, for those of you who need to bump up that 100% achievements count, sure why not, go nuts.

												The Collider is a simple, yet unique game that ""puts your reflexes to the test.""  It's a fast paced arcade type of game that takes place inside a particle accelerator and you will have to go through obstacles to pass the test.I'm not going to go into many details, but The Collider is a fast paced game, and I mean a very fast paced game. The levels will progressively get harder and you will accelerate faster and faster towards the obstacles, giving you less time to maneuver them and will challenge your reflex skills.The controls are very simple, you just use your mouse to move the particle around and avoid the obstacles. It also has some controller support so that is a plus.The achievements can be easy to get, you'll most likely get them all within an hour or so. The leaderboard is also a very nice feature to have, you can try to beat your friends' score and it gives you a purpose to keep going further than usual. The music is really decent as you play it, I like it. :)And let's not forget about the trading cards. ;)All in all, it is enjoyable and yet, challenging at the same time. You won't get very far at first, but you know what they say: ""Practice makes perfect.""Should you buy this game?I'd say you should. If you are looking for a challenge or some relaxing fun then yes, you should. It's worth the small price. Or you can just wait for a sale to happen if that's your style.7.5/10			",28,8,4,5,5,0,0

												I have always dreamed about becoming a proton moving at almost light speed inside a particle accelerator, and now I can re-create these dreams in this particle accelerator simulator game!You play as a tiny white packet of protons which are stripped of all of their electrons inside a particle accelerator, or a ""collider"", as it is called, moving through certain obstacles, although a collider will not usually have such obstacles for the packet of protons to maneuver through, I will assume they are magnetic accelerators, as  maybe in a newer design I am not yet familiar with are already implemented in.However, I was personally confused as to why there was only one proton shown, as normally, there would be ""packets"" of protons, consisting of roughly 100 billion protons per packets, with roughly 1500 packets. Although I take this as a mistake, I will not be to critical as this could of been a design choice, as having all this on your screen may be slightly distracting game-play wise.I was also slightly dissappointed with the introduction, as I was really hoping to be able to traverse through different boosters, as this was the highlight of my particle accelerating fantasies. I was also very dissapointed with the lack of ending cutscenes, as I am still very curious as to what happens to the packet you are in control of. as there is no other protons to be able to collide with, I lost loads of fantasy filled nights thinking over the results of this specific collider. I was expecting there to be a cutscene at the end where you finally collide with another proton to cause many new particles or atoms to fling out so I could record the results. But maybe there will be a DLC, or even better, a sequel to the game which might show this.Overall, I found this collider simulator very fun to play, although not very realistic, I had a great time achieving the fantasies I've always had.

												Described as ""The fastest game on Steam,"" the premise of The Collider is to hop into a particle accelerator, travel at break-neck speeds while making split-second directional choices to avoid obstacles, all the while listening to hypnotic electronic music. The game starts off slowly enough, allowing you to get the feel for it, but before long has you racing at considerable speeds.The Collider seems like a wonderful little title to kick back and unwind with.

												This game is pretty cool, very simple, requires good reflex, cool soundtrack and nice graphics too. This game is very cheap, but it's also extremely fast to complete and plays really smooth!I guess it's an android port, so the controls are simple; you only have to move your mouse and go through the holes without crashing. The leaderboards actually show if you are playing on Steam, Android or Apple.So, if you want to play a very short but nice game, pick this one up! Personally I think $3 is a bit too much, maybe $1-2. The game is good but it's just so simple and short. There's a bit of replayability at least, so go ahead and play it!			",1385,503,40,149,121,21,186

												Really short game, putting you inside a kaleidoscope, in role of particle, or beam of light... whatever. I quoted this already, in other review, but I must repeat that sentence: ""It is not possible to see of any psychic experience from common physical elements like movement and masses"" (E.Mach, Erkenntnis und Irrtum. p.12). Again, I think that Mach was not right in his philosophy, while being a genius in physics.All this little game, Collider, is about speed. You're accelerating, then accelerating further, and even faster... until finally you meet some obstruction on the way, and game begins anew. And you know what? It appears that I'm afraid of speed! I wasn't so scared while playing Amnesia or strolling through the 100-meter precipice in real life! I can drive my Skoda up to 160 km/h (100 mph for you, Imperials) quite easily, but I was frightened big time while going through that Collider. Certainly, I'm not of Midi-chlorian symbionts, and don't deserve to flight to the Death Star.Still, I was able to beat this game in one hour for the gold, with all achievements unlocked. And after another hour of idling I got 3 steam cards, each worth quite alot.So I definitely recommend this game! For one, you can test yourself with the speed, to know your limits, and so on. Second, you getting steam cards which costs almost as much as this game without any discount. That means, if you buy The Collider on sale, or via bundle, you'll even get a profit! And, for third, if you not a victim of tachophobia, you'll get a nice easy full-complete game.My mark 7/10. Quick game, nice atmosphere of pure speed. Become the wave!			",725,237,45,155,101,5,232

												The Collider, developed by Shortbreak Studios, offers the chance to test the reflexes, and how long one can go without blinking in a fast paced ""thread the needle"" type game. A simple concept, to be sure, so how does the game ultimately fare?There is little to say about The Collider, as it isn't so much a typical game, as it is a mild distraction to stave off boredom. Basically, the aim of the game is to thread a white dot, representing the cursor of the mouse, through circular panels that have small openings, some with coins, and some without. Crash and it is a loss of life; crash enough times and it's Game Over. It is possible to continue from crashing via spending the coins that are collected.That's really all there is to it.The main thing to keep the game going is the incremental increases in speed. At first it is pedestrian, but later on, the game whizzes along at such a speed that any form of blinking will result in a crash and Game Over.Essentially, anyone with experience in staring contests and with good reflexes should be able to have plenty of fun with the game. That's really all there is to it, though.Colourful and joyous, there's not really any graphics to speak of, but the courses are a wonderful kaleidoscope of colours. The soundtrack is rather basic with a whooshing sound as the thread goes through the needles.The Collider is a solid game that sets out what it wants to do: get the player jumping through hoops at ridiculous speeds. That is all it offers, though; there isn't enough here to justify a score higher than 5/10.			",2249,864,87,235,309,22,348

												I got a coupon earlier today for making a badge. At first, I didn't think much since most coupons are for games that are of poor quality. When I saw the generous 90%, though, i investigated. Thank goodness I did! The 30 cents I put on this game have been the most satisfying 30 cents in my life. Heck, If I knew this game existed I would have paid full price for it. It is a clever game, resembling one of those old arcade games. The only difference is, you don't have to pay to play again. Its 3 dollers flat, and you can go on and on. No in game purchases to give you boosts, the only boosts you get are the ones you earn in the game. The controls are utterly easy to learn, the senstivity slider is a good implimcation. I also like the leaderboard, because it gives you a goal to set a distance. I love the music, and the graphics though simple make the game pleasant to look at. There are no bugs or concerns. Its a perfect 30 cents spent for me. If your buying this, and you like time killing games that trap you in a world of flying between holes at light speed, then 3 bucks would also be worth it.FInal statement: A clever, and suprisingly visually and mentally pleasing game. (Don't forget the music!)Totally worth the small price, I can picture myself tommorow spending some decent time continuing to train my reflexes and precesion on this wonderful game.

												The Collider places you inside of a particle accelerator that shoots you to incredibly fast speeds. The object of the game is to get as far along as you can before crashing. As you move along at dizzying speeds, you collect coins while avoiding obstacles. The coins can be used to revive you when you crash (which will be very often) up to three times in a round, which ends up being very helpful once you get farther along in the accelerator. There is a nice variety of obstacles, but I sometimes wish there were more.The sound is okay, but not something I would want to listen to for long. Luckily, there is a mute button, so this isn't a problem. You can just rock out to whatever you want, while improving your reflex skills.There's not much to The Collider, but it's definitely worth picking up if you like racing games. It's also nice for achievement hunters, since it only take a little bit of time to unlock them all. Be sure to get it while it's on sale, for that's when you'll be happiest with your purchase.

												The Collider is a very short but immensely satisfying reflex game. You basically have to pass through obstacles without crashing while constantly increasing speed at a fixed rate. It's quite casual in the sense that you don't have to finish speed 100 to 1300 in one sitting. You can readjust the starting speed whenever you unlock a new one (which makes for quick and painless achievements). My only complaint with the game is that I somehow lost progress after reaching 1200. I tried to record the last stretch on Fraps and I'm not sure what happened during that time to trigger it. Thankfully, you can easily re-climb back to 1300 by using extra lives that cost coins. For all of you achievement hunters, don't use extra lives if you're trying to get the no-crash achievements. Whenever you crash, just go back to main menu and replay at the desired speed.4/5. Very affordable and I definitely recommend it.			",1696,736,69,252,221,20,307

It is very simple and easy to control, but is incredibly fast paced, very challenging and very fun, it's also another of those games with a great soundtrack. This game will test your reflexes and reaction speed to the limit, it is very short but very quick giving you very little time to make your moves the further you progress into the game.There have been some complaints in the reviews and community hub regarding the achievements, in my case, they work(ed) fine, but I had to restart the game in order for them to take effect. There isn't much else to say about this game that isn't already clear on the store page, what you see in the trailer is what you get. Think fast, move fast, and work your way up the leader board. The Collider often goes on sale for a very low price (£0.67 when I purchased it) so don't miss it if it does, it's definitely worth the money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is not bad, but it is not great ... There is no point in it ... The user colects some kind of coins used only for reviving. So Far so good, but one can only revive 3 times, 5, 20 and 50 coins and the usual coins per game go way above 150, thus one is piling coins with no obiows reason. It could be me, but I couldnt find a shop or other place to spend them. So finally I just gave up.  On the good side, the game has Android, IOS and Windows versions and there is a shared weekly tournament, wich I see as the only reason to play the game. The down side of the tourney is that the prize is coins ... wich as said alrdy are pretty much useless, but hey a good competition is always fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The collider is a short, reaction-oriented game requiring you to pass through gaps in an everlasting tunnel. While rapidly increasing the speed travelling through the tunnel, the game quickly becomes a greater test of reaction-speed in order to reach as far as possible. With some nice entrancing music and a colorful, almost hypnotic environment, this little game can certainly allow you to zone out for quite some time. Worth considering for those achievement hunters (pretty fast to obtain 100%) especially when heavily reduced in the sales.Pros:+ Nice music+ Bright, colorful environment+ Relaxing+ Leaderboards+ Very cheap in the salesCons:- Very short- Controller support lacks fluid motion (mouse works very well)- Very repetitiveMy Score: 6/10			",423,136,3,45,19,1,47

												In my opinion The Collider is one of those hidden gems waiting to be played, the gameplay offers you a fast paced thread the needle type game were you the player is tested it is in fact a test of reaction time however this brings me to my next point if your reactions are slow on FPS games (First person shooters) then this game is like a workout which will increase your reaction speed - 8/10 Would defo play again.

												Someone threw pennies in a collider. You are an enterprising up-and-coming proton who is looking to strike it rich and set a new speed record in this fast paced thriller. In the end your addiction to adrenaline will mean you crash into a wall going at speeds well in excess of mandated safety limits, but how else would a stylish playboy proton go out?

The game in itself is solid enough to be very fluid and responsive, but there are better and longer-lived and more interesting and enjoyable games of this style around, such as Rage Runner and T.E.C. 3001, just to name a couple.Don't waste your money; this isn't worth the three dollars.

												The Collider is a super fast-paced indie arcade game where you have to speed through the levels and aim your cursor in the openings of the approaching walls. The speed in which the level moves increases with every 100 point incriment in your score up to 1200 that´s the max. , after u reached 1200 points the run will go on until u die like always but the speed won´t grow anymore.It´s a good game with epic music but there is only one game mode. The creator could make much more out of that concept and add some more levels or game modes. At the moment u can play it a few times and then it will become boring very fast.So the sound, colors and concept are cool but it quickly get boring: 6/10+ colors+ music+ concept+ controls- short time playable- only one game mode- can´t choose colors of the tunnel ( that´s my personal request)I would buy it in sale again but not for the full price :)			",98,15,2,5,5,0,5

												This game does everything it sets out to do, which is minimal, and achieves it spectacularly. The Collider is all about guiding a small point on your screen through an ever hastening tunnel of obstacles, changing colors, and engaging music. It's exactly what you expect it to be, and a lot of fun too. The shine wears off rather quickly, but for the die-hard fan there are leader boards and achievements to unlock.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is a clever little game. The feeling of speed is addictive and you will be endlessly trying to best your last high score (and everyone else's).Stripped down to its most basic element, you have to make sure that a tiny spot goes through a lot of circles. However, if you've played this game you'll know that it's all about the tunnel. To beat the tunnel you must focus on the tunnel and ultimately become one with the tunnel. I have become one with the tunnel. I'm still bad at it, though. Sigh.Verdict: Like a cross between Audiosurf and Tron. Which is good. Unless you don't like Audiosurf or Tron.

												This is the sort of game you can play in micro-sessions. It is a skill based game where you move at high speeds while trying to avoid slamming into the wall. Now I know what it is like to be Han Solo. It is a tiny game that is explained perfectly by the store page trailer.Advice: Don't even bother to use an Xbox controller. You need to play this game with a mouse with maximum sensitivity or you will fail endlessly.			",114,22,4,33,28,1,32

												Great game just remember to to blink, inhale, exhale.Unfortunatly the achievments seem to have issues since in game beating the highscore or achieving certain distance with no crash will not enable the achievments?!?!Good game though,I am editing my review to help others. For the ones who have problems with the achievements not unlocking I found a way to unlock them easily and found other tricks too.If you make a run up to let say for example 800 and crash for the first time, do not repair but rather simply press esc right after crashing to get to the menu then press ALT+F4 which will hard stop the game and the achievement will popup.Also I notice by accident that you can actually start your games from your last checkpoint! I did a test where I was at 1200 without crashing so I started from that point by pressing forward on the menu top screen, you will see that you can change the starting point. I did a run from 1200 to 1300 without crashing then did crash and did the ESC then ALT+F4 and the achievement for 1300 without crashing unlocked?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its time to move the couch in front of the 70"" TV,  get the box fans out, place strategically around the tv, turn on full blast, and play 'The Collider'. Don't forget the snacks as you're going to be playing for a while until you beat it. Yes, 'The Collider' has that essential element to it, that challenges you to beat it. It's a very simple but frustrating game. and forces you to play it until you have beaten it ! Its simple fun, and it apparently messes with time and space, as before you know it, you have either beaten it in an hour, and gotten another perfect game to show off on your profile, or you have spent most of the day in front of it, wandering why you can't quite make the last couple of achievements. The collider isn't very original, essentially a simplified 'Race The Sun', or perhaps 'AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity' ... it isn't really that well done ...not many options, variety, or backing music but it works. The game is simply coded to consist of a narrow light tunnel which is constructed to give the impression of motion, with occasional twists and turns, obstacles are introduced which consist of disks with holes of varying shape and size blocking said tunnel, occasionally rotate through which you have to navigate. It has 13 levels which once beaten can be used as a starting point to continue in your efforts to complete the game. These save points make it easier to beat and greatly simplifies the pursuit of the 'perfect game'.  Its all about not blinking, turning up the mouse sensitivity, drinking coffee and getting those reflexes sharpened.... if you're like me and really really _REALLY_ old, its going to be really hard....and you will be writing reviews just to get a break! But if you're not out of elementary school you should be done in an hour. Don't think about it, buy this game, don't even waste time looking for a coupon on the forums... buy it now, play it now. You will enjoy.			",1976,709,69,213,226,21,273

While it lacks in the awesome sound of said game, it comes with decent music and is cross-platform, so you can compete on any medium. I always look for games to play to give a sense of speed for when I just want to listen to some music, and this is a good fit for that. The pre-1300 levels almost act as a tutorial for the real challenge: getting to the top.Pros:-Easy controls-Cross-Platform Leaderboard-Intresting visualsCons:-Bad Sound DesignA great deal for it's price.

												Incredibly addictive, the need for fast reflexes, eye drops on account of not being able to blink at all, other than that htis game is incredibly worth every penny. If you've considered buying this you should no longer consider but just buy it, the cards are worth quite a bit themselves, the game looks so fantastic with everything zipping by it seems almost impossible to look at. The game gets a tad repetive but every course is different, none are the same, there are weekly ""objectives"" or something like that, forgot what it was called. A global leader board (I'm thirteenth player c:) other than that it seems to be worth it, it is an amazing game and has some amazing gameplay, definently would recommend you guys to buy this. 10/10 for sure.

 Preview - What is The Collider? The Collider is that old acrade-styled game transformed into something new. You may of played something similar to this before some time in your life. You are falling and you must go through the holes and pass 10 levels to complete the game. While this does sound plain and simple, it's not as easy as it sounds. Levels 1-5 are easy, however as levels go on it gets harder and harder to the point where it is insane to keep up.But what makes this game stand out? Why this game rather than other games like this game? First, the graphics are so colorful and energy-like that makes it stand out. The music at first may sound plain but then it get's better to the point where it is in your head for a very very long time. But that's only some of what this game has to offer. Let me show you some pros and cons to help you understand why this game is so good: Pros  Energy-like graphics Great music Steam achievements! Steam trading cards! Cheap! Leaderboard! Coin system! Cons  Game-breaking bugs (cheating bug) Short game Conclusion The Collider is a great upgrade to those acrade games you played as a kid. There is more pros than cons within this game. There is little to nothing wrong with this game. So...Does The Collider seem good to you? Buy it then! :D Overall Rating: 9/10  My Group's Curator Page!  ",110,47,5,16,6,5,13

												The Collider is a brilliant simple and fun reflex game where you simply just use your mouse to aim at the holes in the tunnel. Along the way, you try to collect coins (Which are used to give you another chance) as well as test yourself on how far you can go. Just do your best and don't hit anything. Speed, reflex, timing, and careful aiming will get you through the game. A fun game for everyone of all ages...			",271,112,11,57,66,0,36

												First off and foremost I'll name the good things about this game: If you like games to challenge your friends to play, this is a decent one. It's cheap, starts off slow but gets going and has pleasent music paired with pretty colors. Gameplay is simple: get through the holes without crashing. There is a weekly tournament held for retry coins that you can also earn in-game. It's not Pay2Win. I've never played a game quite like this and I must say it's nice to take a break from shooters, RTS and open world sandbox style games. Basically, it's a good way to waste an hour or two.With that said, why do I not recommend The Collider? Well at the risk of sounding like a broken record: ""Basically, it's a good way to waste an hour or two."" There is no replay value whatsoever. The highest speed you can start at is 1300 even if you get up to 1400 speed. After you reach your peak there isn't really a good reason to keep playing. There are no ""levels"" in the traditional sense. The color of the track changes as the speed increases but thats it. There are no characters, no story, no other game modes to play - NOTHING. You could challenge yourself to get all the Achievements but, they do not unlock. AT ALL. EVER! I've seen other people have this problem since at least November of 2014 and people still are having this problem now in April of 2015. I'd say any chance of a fix is long gone by now. I would only suggest buying this game if you have a coupon for it as a way to increase your steam rank. Otherwise it's not even worth the $2.99 asking price.EXTRA COMMENTS: I have no clue how fast we are going. 1300 MPH? 1300 KPH? 1300 Light-years per hour? In my personal opinion I'd rather spend $2.99 on a pack of gum. I'd get more use out of the gum than this game. Thank goodness for that 90% off coupon, only cost me 30 cents.			",41,4,2,10,1,0,7

												I started out playing this game originally when the achievements were unlockable for me, and I gave this game a thumbs up. Now that the achievements have unlocked for me, I can't help but retract my thumb up and give it a heavy thumb down.I, when the achievements unlocked for me, unlocked all of them...easily...in one sitting...in 2 MINUTES!!!!!! If you have look at how long I have played this game [1.8 hours], it took a fraction of that time for me to unlock EVERYTHING!!! And no, the 1.8 hours wasn't from just leaving the game on, it was from playing the game, pure and simple. And sure, there isn't much to do, but holy ♥♥♥♥, it was super disappointing to unlock the achievements. I, before unlocking the achievements, played The Collider for the leaderboard, and also got the app for my iPhone to see what was easier. Both, in the end, were very disappointing for me and left me with a few minutes of entertainment/frustration (more of the latter).In the end, do not buy this game. Sure, all of the achievements are easy to unlock, but the game, overall, is NOT WORTH IT. PERIOD.			",97,27,1,10,6,0,4

The Collider is an odd reflex game. It's along the same lines as Super Hexagon in that it's addictive and high-energy, but is basically a flash game.The objective here is to guide a small dot in the center of your monitor through an infinitely long tube comprised of screens with holes in it; you hit a screen, you die. The ultimate goal is to survive as long as possible. If you can guess, the game is rather punishing: expect to die a lot and make very little progress.The achievements are very wonky and unlock all at once after you quit the game. It took me all of 19 minutes of gameplay to get them all without trying--so there's that.In conclusion, other than demanding intense focus and quick reflexes, this game doesn't offer a lot of playtime. There are no special modes or items--just the base game. It's interesting the first few times around, but definitely not worth $3. Maybe try it if it's on sale and you have an extra quarter lying around, but otherwise, skip it.			",63,12,2,9,9,0,9

												In ""The Collider"" you play as a dot inside a particle accelerator going faster throughout each ""stage."" Along the way you will earn money, and points to be put into a leaderboard. But beyond that, I cannot see any other ""stand out"" features within this game. In itself, the mechanics that make it ""simplistic, and intuitive,"" as the description of this game states, makes it quite bland, and it gets old quite quickly.From my first experience with this game, I booted it up and saw the default Unity Launcher with no customisation at all (a great sign for any game that I just payed money for! Sure, if you have a Unity logo on setup, I don't mind, because you're making a game for free to get money to make more games. However, when you don't customise the launcher AT ALL, it demonstrates to me that you put no effort into first impressions.) However, the soundtrack for this game was good!Getting into the game was a surprise as I saw the leaderboard filled up with iOS and Android, but, I decided to move on because maybe iOS and Android players of this game are better/have more experience at this game? The gameplay at the start was actually quite entertaining, until it got to the point where it was the same thing, just faster, and faster, and faster. By the first 40 minutes of playing, I had completed almost all the levels inside the game.I cannot help but feel as though this is just a game really badly trying to be Super Hexagon, without being Super Hexagon. Overall, the first 10 minutes of this game was actually quite enjoyable... until you realise it starts to become very ""samish"" throughout the game. I think you should spend the extra premium of 2 dollars or so and buy Super Hexagon, a much more enjoyable game that (although having almost the same amount of content) is quite addicting, and is very challanging.

												I just spent short entertaining moment to 'finish' the game, but it's enough for me to guarantee some enjoyment for you playing this. 15-20 mins are enough, it's a cheap bundle fodder anyway. Not to mention I can complete the achievement set easily, it's a bonus.This is another version of Super Hexagon, can be infuriating especially when you fail the last distance to get the next checkpoints but hey... it's a part of the game. You will auto move forward and your job is to get as far as you can without hitting the obstacle in FPS mode - think of FPS racing except you don't have rival around you. Each 100 distance mark will earn you checkpoints, of which you can replay from the point onward to get even further. The last required distance is 1300 (as in checkpoint and achievement), so after that there's little to zero replay value.Be warned, though, there have been reports of achievements failing to pop up, although there's a workaround found by players already. And there's silence from the developer, so if you see his future title, consider of his abandonment of this title also before purchasing.Score: 7/10			",1566,614,62,185,176,20,269

												Alright, yeah, I can promise that this game is probably a million times more fun than it looks. It's very simple, and seems easy when you start playing, but becomes excruicatingly painful/fun as it goes forward. There's a neat feature on the left side of your screen that shows you the name of the next person whose score you are approaching, along with a bar that fills up to show you how close you're getting. It's really special because, very quickly, you'll get the interesting experience of taunting yourself as you die a million times just below your old high score.			",99,14,2,16,11,2,12

												I have to say I was quite disappointed. It only offers one track, even though you can't deny that it is quite a nice song. The gameplay wa quite dull, basically it was just Tracking your mouse over a dot to make it hover through holes in obstacles, with the speed increasing to ultimately 1300.  The graphics were like that of a free to play flash game you would find on the internet. I regret that I didn't read the reviews before I got this, it shouldn't cost 3 ♥♥♥♥in' dollars. hell, it should be free! You see all these positive reviews saying that it can improve your reflexes in FPS games, that's just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Too ashamed to admit that they actually spent money on this peice of crap, they decide to give it a good excuse:"" It helps your concentration as well as a bit of mouse control."" It's just like that part in ""The adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" where the frauds ""King"" and ""Duke"" put up a fake show and the townspeople who were tricked by it decide to lure more people to watch it instead of exposing the fraud show, because they were afraid of being laughed at; and then everyone in town went and all stepped on the same boat: being swindled by the frauds to their show. Anyways, on overall this game still gets a 6 out of 10.			",59,33,1,5,5,2,5

												In collider you are moving down a tube where you build up speed as you move along trying to dodge through holes in these discs that show up. They may be stationary or moving and the holes may be in different shapes and sizes. You can pick up coins as you move along that you can spend to keep yourself going if you wreck.I had fun for about 15 minutes and then moved on.

												It's a nice idea, but fundamentally flawed.  It's enjoyable when you're making progress, but it's so quick and easy to get up to 1300, which is all the achievements.  There was no unlock at 1400, so I'm assuming that 1300 is the last unlockable start speed.    1300 is pretty crazy and with no option to start faster, makes it harder to progress. If there was a 1400 unlock, I could then more easily push for  1500 etc.   Could do with some other gametypes to add some variation.			",210,162,8,7,34,2,28

												The Collider is a fun little time waster. It's a simple first-person autorunner. The graphics are simple and bright and change color as you level up your speed every 100 points. I would like to point out that I got this game with a steam coupon for 30 cents and at that price I can say the game is worth it. However, the game retails for $2.99 and feels like a free or 0.99cents smartphone game. If you have the cash enjoy this gem, if not there are better deals on steam.			",1165,519,16,206,133,9,157

												The Collider is a pretty basic speed running game. While you're not actually running but rather flying, you start off slow and it gradually gets faster and faster until you end up crashing into a wall. The only other mechanic is that you are able to use coins that you collect to buy yourself a reset. The cost goes up until eventually you use up all your lives and have to start over.At specifics speeds the game provides checkpoints up until a certain point so you don't have to waste unnecessary time to get back up to the speed where you were at before your game ended. If you do however manage to last from the start up until around where the last checkpoint is, the music will stop.I would also get into that I was a bit surprised to only really see a single level that was not really up to much variation. I would be lying if I said it got repetitive as I did not play the game long enough for it to be so. This game would greatly benefit from extra levels and variety to add to the longevity. The game currently lasts under an hour of gameplay. I completed all of the achievements for this game and consider this game essentially complete. The amount of time the game lasts is not really all that long but at a price of $2.99 it does not appear to be a great value when compared to some other titles. The high scores or tournament type system at the end of each game that pop up also feels like you can never really benefit from winning because the game does not last more than a night.The ultimate question however is about the fun factor. I cannot say that I did not have fun. I had a pretty good time for the short time that I played this game. There aren't any deal breakers and I definitely do not feel like I wasted my money. Even then, it might be worth picking up just to get all the achievements if you're into that kind of thing. ",290,41,6,38,35,1,43

												its a steam card game, so objectively there's no reason to bash on it, after all its free money for most people who got this on giveaways.however here's the things wrong with the game.-achievements in this game are far too easy to collect, i bet i would have gotten all of them if i had played this game when i was 5. what's wrong with this? fundamentally, that it rewards users far too much for not doing much of anything. destroys the feeling of ""achieving"" something since you get them almost immediately. stops feeling like a reward altogether. (not saying there aren't people who like to just add achievements to their steam list)-after the first 2 to 4 minutes, you've seen the entire game, no reason to replay it after getting all the cards, even other mobile endless runners have more content than this, and for free.-cards take far too long to come out for what the game really is, for example.i felt like i was done with the game after 20 or 30 minutes of play...and i was, in fact the only reason i have 2 hours+ of play is because that's what it took me to get all of my card drops so in reality, i only played half an hour, even if i were to replay i don't think i'd play over an hour of this game before uninstalling.ultimately having steam trading cards as one of the biggest reasons to get a game is still objectively bad game design and marketing. want proof? the only reason i realised i had this game on my library was because i was browsing my uninstalled games list. after the cards drop, there's no reason to come back, you are done.

												I recommend against this game on two main grounds. 1. This game offers no signficant advantages over the free Flash equivalents.2. For a paid game, particularly one with free alternatives, it has a lot of mistakes / bugs / issues.Some of the big issues are: Achievements in the game don't become unlocked when you meet the criteria, top scores feature for the game does not work, in game documentation is next to none, available documentation has typos, and finally the point value earned for hitting coins is seemingly random.Overall, it's got decent music for this type of game, goes full screen nicely, and is amusing for 15 minutes. However not worth paying for given the issues and availability of free alternatives. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yet noticed some that I should have had, were missing. After doing some research into why, I was able to obtain 100% within a few tries. Although while doing so, I lost total interest in playing the game. Uninstalled after idling for cards. Thanks for the level 93.			",692,252,17,71,73,6,83

												Casual Gamer here,I have to say, firstly picking this game up i thought i might get seizures from all the fast moving colours and objects. After 60 minutes of playing i was hooked! going through those little circles. Then my friend joined me and we tried to beat each-others scores. No clue what we were doing but was entertaining. For a game that is $3, you get what you paid, however here are my pros and cons.Pro's- Game is fun and helps with your hand to eye co-ordination. - Game is great to pass time (expecially at an airport)- It gets challanging going from speed 100 to speed 700 and not crashing.- Music is repetative but doesn't distract your playCon's- Finished it quite quickly, would love to have more different objects or more than a colored tube.- Getting 100% was relatively easy, about 2 hours gameplay.- Might fry your brain. Conclusion, I want to give this game to my friends to see how far they will go before they lose their minds. If on special, it is a small game just to play when killing time for something else. 6.5/10 would go crazy again.			",51,6,2,18,8,0,16

												Now that I am no longer having problems with my achievements unlocking, I can fully say, ""I recommend this game."" I like its simplicity, colorfulness, and need for quick reactions. The mouse sensitivity can mess with you a little in either the beginning stages or towards the end. (i.e. you increase sensitivity it can throw you off a little for being oversensitive in the beginning but if you decrease too much, you are not fast enough at higher speeds)Pros:-Simple-Colorful-Easy achievements (particularly now that they are fixed!)Cons:-Short and only one modeOverall, 8.5/10			",441,127,5,67,24,1,65

This is usually not a game i'd play, but i still find this pretty decent. You're a little dot that has to get through some holes, starting slow at ""100"" and then it just gets faster and faster, you don't need anything else but your mouse, it starts pretty boring but it gets funnier the faster it gets. I reached ""1100"" then i couldn't get further.			",266,128,8,29,18,3,23

I Recomend this game because it is very fun/addictive and is cheap.        This game helps your aim because the crosshair pn your screen needs to go through the holes and it helps with aim correction not the flick shots. ",49,4,1,5,7,0,5

Fun, Fast-Paced, and CasualThe Collider is a simple arcade game where you use your mouse to control the white dot in the center. The goal is to get as far as possible by controlling the dot to get through the holes, and moving obstacles. I highly reccomend this game, but I would suggest buying during a sale though. I didn't put in enough time for it to be worth $3, but you might, depending on what you use the game for.Uses:There are several ways to utilize this game. Here are some examples. Great for killing time Practicing aim and reaction time for FPS games like CS:GO Pure enjoyment, as the game itself is really fun.

												First, I just want to not that I got this game using a 90% Discout Coupon from the Steam Marketplace, so I only pain $0.30 for it. The game is really simple and doesn't have a whole lot to offer, so it probably isn't worth $3.00. But if you can get it for practically nothing, then it's good for killing time. The Steam Trading Cards don't begin dropping until you've logged 2+ hours of play-time, therefore it might take a few play sessions to earn them. What I think can be said about this game, is that navigating the curving corridor and lining your cursor up with each opening could help to hone your First-Person-Shooter reaction times and enemy tracking accuracy. The Leaderboard keeps track of everyones highest obtained speed. Each week, in-game replay coins are awarded to the top 10 players, and then the board resets. This feature does add a little bit of intrigue to the game, you never know when you might make the top 10. I even made 8th myself once. Is your FPS hand fast enough to be number one?

												First thing first, achievements in this game doesn't work. From Steam Community I found out I have to install some Visual C++ packages from Microsoft's page. It is quite unacceptable that player have to do something like this to make game fully work. And this is not even free game, I wonder how Steam let clearly broken games to be in their shop. After some C++ installations, I got the achievements. All of them during few games, even though I didn't actually reach those goals I should have.Other than that, this is nice small game. Looks okay and sounds okay. Fast paced and some good reflections are needed. Or getting to some weird flow state where you stare screen and move mouse without thinking anything. Fun to play few times, but I don't see so much reason to go back to this game.If the achievements would work, this game would be worth of those few euros. But now it is broken and unfortunately I can not recommend this game. ",62,9,2,0,1,0,4

												In short, I thought The Collider was alright- it's a little reminiscent of Super Hexagon, albeit simpler. It's fun (and addictive) but very simple. Once you've played for two minutes, you can imagine the next twenty. Also, it's stupidly easy to play with a mouse- the difficulty spikes when you're playing with a controller.

												This is an enjoyable game, that is simple in nature yet hard to master.  Appropriately called 'an arcade game', you aim at the holes on spinning disks with your mouse-pointer while you go progessively faster and faster. For every 100 mph faster, the discs and background change color. Sometimes the disks spin around more than other times, adding extra challenge. There is electronic music that adds to the feel overall. Sometimes you'll find yourself laughing at how good you're doing, or the way the different colors add to the thrillride here, and it is fun, and even spellbinding. It's especially good for a few minutes at a time, and I also find it fun in-between games on days we play a few games on Steam, and I also found it gets you prepared for better focus in other games on those days...which is a bonus, really. If you're looking at this game and thinking about getting it, then by all means, go for it. The appeal stays over time, too.			",752,135,17,57,19,6,16

I would describe it as more of a ""stocking stuffer"" type of game, not one that will hold your attention for very long but a good experience nontheless. However, be warned that it can get somewhat challenging the faster you go. It would have been a hit if it had decent music rather than the generic crap that it gives us.

												Let me say this straight and simple: If you are going to buy this game, you are going to buy this game because of the incredible ease it takes to obtain all the achievements. It takes most about 20-60 minutes to do this, and even still many people have difficulty getting the achievements validated. Look to the forums if you have problems, the solutions are there.The reason why I put this as thumbs down is because there is a free (and much better) game that is like this one on Kongregate. It is called Accelerator, here's the link http://www.kongregate.com/games/TenebrousP/accelerator.The main differences between this one that you are paying money for and the free one are the sounds, visual, and a few game play differences. Accelerator has a much better sound system, but no music. It doesn't need it. It ends up giving a much better atmosphere than Collider without the music. Also complimenting the atmosphere are the visuals. There are no drastic colour changes besides the square tunnels being blue. This gives the game a more stream lined sense, and helps the progression without accidentally crashing.While this isn't a problem in Collider because of the reviving function, Accelerator doesn't have that. it is much more harder because of this and you feel like you have actually achieved something. What Accelerator does have is a difficulty setting, and this changes one thing mainly, the level design. Harder difficulty levels will result in tight corners and diverging paths, which when you are going fast, become really difficult to traverse. It just adds to the feel of satisfaction when you get that impossible badge for reaching a speed of 1000.All in all, my basic gripe was paying for this. Yes it is cheap, yes it gave me a perfect achievement thing, but in all honesty, why play this when Accelerator on Kongregate is free and so much better?			",339,62,5,48,21,3,52

												First thing first, achievements in this game doesn't work. From Steam Community I found out I have to install some Visual C++ packages from Microsoft's page. It is quite unacceptable that player have to do something like this to make game fully work. And this is not even free game, I wonder how Steam let clearly broken games to be in their shop. After some C++ installations, I got the achievements. All of them during few games, even though I didn't actually reach those goals I should have.Other than that, this is nice small game. Looks okay and sounds okay. Fast paced and some good reflections are needed. Or getting to some weird flow state where you stare screen and move mouse without thinking anything. Fun to play few times, but I don't see so much reason to go back to this game.If the achievements would work, this game would be worth of those few euros. But now it is broken and unfortunately I can not recommend this game. ",62,9,2,0,1,0,4

												Four runs in, and I'm ranked sixth on the global leaderboard.  Six, and I've beaten all achievements.It has a severe need for more coin usage, though - for the cost of respawns, I would care less if the coins were only tracked per run. (five coins to respawn when I've already gathered 150?  wow)  Plus, the top scoring runs get a bunch of coins from the tournaments.  At the very least, make us purchase each speed unlock after we've gone fast enough to break that interval.Also, if you're going to include a progress bar that ranks you against other people, include a numerical ranking to their screen handles.  Does it help that I know that I've almost passed Dylan's high score?  Not as much as if I knew his was the 25th ranking high score.Now then, time to blow global rankings out of the water.

												An awesome reincarnation of an old Newgrounds game. Difficult, fair, and a solid test of your reaction and accuracy. Beautifully simple yet it keeps itself fresh with the increase in speed and more dynamic obstacles. The only downside is that it caps itself to 48FPS on my 96Hz monitor (I'm assuming because the FPS cap is 60 and it forces Vsync), which for a game like this, I think really shouldn't happen.

												I just bought 'The Collider' last night on sale for $1.01. Great purchase!It is a fun, simple, and unique game in the arcade/racing genre.The basic jist of the game is that you are a particle in a particle accelerator. (excuse my lack of knowledge of science)You use only the mouse to control the particle through various obstacles in the accelerator.The game has great speed and could compare to other games like wipEout or F-Zero.It is pretty addicting and I find myself constantly clicking the 'play again' button.I did however notice various patterns of obstacles after 40 or 50 minutes of gameplay. It became a bit repetitive.Also repetitive was the song used when playing. There is only ONE! It would be nice if there was more variance of gameplay like different types of levels, more music tracks, and more patterns of obstacles. Overall, 'The Collider' is a good game that I enjoyed and thus will recommend. It is a little repetitive, but stangely addicting.7/10P.S. I wouldn't pay more than a couple bucks for this one, so wait until a sale comes around :)			",83,4,2,10,6,0,5

												In short, I thought The Collider was alright- it's a little reminiscent of Super Hexagon, albeit simpler. It's fun (and addictive) but very simple. Once you've played for two minutes, you can imagine the next twenty. Also, it's stupidly easy to play with a mouse- the difficulty spikes when you're playing with a controller.

												This is an enjoyable game, that is simple in nature yet hard to master.  Appropriately called 'an arcade game', you aim at the holes on spinning disks with your mouse-pointer while you go progessively faster and faster. For every 100 mph faster, the discs and background change color. Sometimes the disks spin around more than other times, adding extra challenge. There is electronic music that adds to the feel overall. Sometimes you'll find yourself laughing at how good you're doing, or the way the different colors add to the thrillride here, and it is fun, and even spellbinding. It's especially good for a few minutes at a time, and I also find it fun in-between games on days we play a few games on Steam, and I also found it gets you prepared for better focus in other games on those days...which is a bonus, really. If you're looking at this game and thinking about getting it, then by all means, go for it. The appeal stays over time, too.			",752,135,17,57,19,6,16

I would describe it as more of a ""stocking stuffer"" type of game, not one that will hold your attention for very long but a good experience nontheless. However, be warned that it can get somewhat challenging the faster you go. It would have been a hit if it had decent music rather than the generic crap that it gives us.

Another big part of this game, is not being hypnotized byt the gorgeous circuitry-like design. Oh, and don't blink, blink and you're dead.			",142,18,1,9,7,0,2

												17 minutes to get 100% achievements108 minutes for cards to drop (I was afk for a bit too)This is a game you play once and then uninstall and forget about it forever- Music is the same track over and over- Obstacle things have 4-5 variations- Deceleration of mouse movement felt a bit floatyGet it if you want an easy 100% achievement game and/or cardsOtherwise, find it in a bundle/sale if you like this sort of thing, or avoid it altogether			",105,46,1,14,11,1,11

												Really gets the eyes and hands going to build up the hand-eye coordination skills in generally. Completely adddictive yet so basic. How I even made it through some parts I really cant understand. I must be a natural since in a matter of .3 hours (when I wrote the review) I am/was 11th best player according to the board (Dracnea). Id recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap but fun way to better your reaction times and other computer eye-hand skills.			",123,14,2,12,5,2,5

												Beautiful.It's like an interactive screensaver.You have to navigate your sight down a particle accelerator, ducking through holes as your speed increases.I just wish the game offered full controller support, so I may use a stick instead of just the mouse.			",50,44,2,7,7,0,4

												It's not hard to unlock the achievements in this game, having gotten 100% of them in 45  minutes of gameplay.What IS hard is getting the trading cards to drop. The game is so tedious that I'm having a hard time playing any more waiting for them to show up.If you're paying full price for this game, don't get it. Wait until it goes on sale or use a coupon.

												Very simple game.  Easy to learn, and though it is repititve, it is highly addicting.  I love that you can choose what speed to start off at rather than having to start from the beginning every time.  Adds to the challenge.  Great liffle coffee break game.			",422,155,26,41,51,3,43

												Very fun little game. Does not come off as being a port from a mobile which is really nice. I would describe it as more of a ""stocking stuffer"" type of game, not one that will hold your attention for very long but a good experience nontheless. However, be warned that it can get somewhat challenging the faster you go. It would have been a hit if it had decent music rather than the generic crap that it gives us. But I suppose you can remedy that yourself			",59,4,1,8,22,1,13

												In short, I thought The Collider was alright- it's a little reminiscent of Super Hexagon, albeit simpler. It's fun (and addictive) but very simple. Once you've played for two minutes, you can imagine the next twenty. Also, it's stupidly easy to play with a mouse- the difficulty spikes when you're playing with a controller.

												This is an enjoyable game, that is simple in nature yet hard to master.  Appropriately called 'an arcade game', you aim at the holes on spinning disks with your mouse-pointer while you go progessively faster and faster. For every 100 mph faster, the discs and background change color. Sometimes the disks spin around more than other times, adding extra challenge. There is electronic music that adds to the feel overall. Sometimes you'll find yourself laughing at how good you're doing, or the way the different colors add to the thrillride here, and it is fun, and even spellbinding. It's especially good for a few minutes at a time, and I also find it fun in-between games on days we play a few games on Steam, and I also found it gets you prepared for better focus in other games on those days...which is a bonus, really. If you're looking at this game and thinking about getting it, then by all means, go for it. The appeal stays over time, too.			",752,135,17,57,19,6,16

												Game was good, crafted a badge and got a 90% off ticket, so i sold some trading cards and bought the game. Started off with the Unity (game making software) screen to choose Resolution and Graphics. Wasn't a good start but when i went into playing i liked the game. The first time i crashed i came on that menu with the leaderboard, which i think needs to be redesigned. Starting at certain speeds was nice, but that made me finish this game under 15 mins. What about adding multiplayer Shortbreak? or challenge mode or something? Also ged rid of the Unity startup. Still was a great game and i didn't pay anything for it.			",158,33,3,12,29,3,5

The Collider can be quite a challenging game, or if you're quick thinking and have a good computer mouse, unlike me, it'll be a very simple game.From 100-500 the game is quite easy, and from 500+ it increases, faster and harder :PI was kind of unsure whether to recommend or not, but the easy achievements and easy controls won over.Note: To Gain Achievements, you must close the game and then they sync up.
