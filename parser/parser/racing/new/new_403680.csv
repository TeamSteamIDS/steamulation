												As deep as it is challenging. If you're a fan of Marble Blast like I was as a kid you'll feel right at home with Dexterity Ball 3D.			",150,32,1,14,20,1,21

												It's fun, challenging, and infuriating. The challenge is enough to glue you to the screen and make you want to WIN!! It really tests your hand-eye coordination.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't think this is an early access game, but I do believe this game is unfinished or unpolished. While not an awful game, it is not one I can personally recommend. On the other hand, I do believe that people who have enjoyed similar games will enjoy this one.			",204,34,1,26,28,3,26

Key provided by developer/publisher. This does not effect my review.Dexterity Ball 3D is an unconstrained, physics and skills based platform game, which can be played in three modes. There is no convoluted back story or adventure included. Your goal: collect all the gems as fast as possible. Are you ready to be challenged?!Tags: Action, Indie, Racing, Physics, Difficult, 3D platformer, Puzzle-Platformer, Singleplayer, MultiplayerList of notable featuresLevels: There are 20 unique “speed run” levels, each with a different focus. However, all of these speed run levels have the same priority: collect ALL of the gems in order to open the teleporter at the end of the level. My favorite level is #3: Yeah Magnets. It throws you into a map with platforms that have no guide rails. Situated along the map in similar locations to gems, you can find and collect magnetic power ups which allow you to stick to walls. This provides for a very unique platforming experience. There is also another game type: which is called endurance. There are 3 different endurance levels. The goal in this game mode is to survive the longest (while collecting gems). By survive, I mean don’t let the timer run out. So, it’s more of a timed trial in which the time can be extended by the player collecting more gems. I had fun playing this once, but other than that, it’s just an extra feature that does not appeal to me as much as the speed run does. I forgot to mention that all the levels are accessible immediately when starting the game, and not unlockable. This is interesting, but it takes away the challenge of unlocking levels as you progress.Achievements/Trading cards: the distance achievements are currently bugged, when I traveled 10 km, I got all six of them. The others are pretty good, some hilarious, and other tedious.Challenging: requires skill and precision, as the controls are a little difficult to work with. You will die a ton, and some levels can take over 10 minutes to beat just because of how difficult they are.Multiplayer mode, also focused on gem collecting.Fairly high price at $7. I would consider $5 to be a little bit more reasonable for what you get gameplay wise. Plus, it has a sort of early access feel.The ball speed feels a bit weird. When you start going forward, the ball launches off at a very high speed. The ball physics take some getting used to for sure.Some suggestions I have: suggestions for game improvement: I think there should be an option that eliminates the necessity of collecting each gem to progress in a level. This would allow the freedom to complete a level at your own pace, not held back by collecting all the gems.Option to adjust mouse sensitivity. This is for UI only, because in-game, it is just fine. It is a hard and slow process navigating through the menu.SummaryIf you like racing, physics-based puzzle platformers, you should definitely check this game out. The few complaints I have are about the price, the way you progress through levels, and the low mouse sensitivity in the UI. Each level in uniquely difficult in its own way. Prepare to fail time and time again.My implemented rating system:Run away! 1-2/10Handle with caution… 3-4/10Buy on sale: 5-6/10Every day purchase: 7-8/10Must buy: 9-10/10This game's rating: 6/10.
