												As someone who has done a lot of mechanical work on their cars over the years, I am happy to say that Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is accurate in many ways.  However, it does lack a number of key components of any wrenching session, such as...-The ""This Bolt is so Badly Rusted and Seized That No Amount of Breaker Bars, Impact Wrenches or Penetrating Oil Can Help You Now"" puzzle;-The ""DO YOU FEEL LUCKY, PUNK?!"" EZ-Out Bolt Extractor Mini-Game;-The ""Dropped a Nut in the Engine Bay and it Didn't Hit the Floor"" experience;-The ""Broke a Thousand-Dollar Part While Attempting to Fix a Ten-Dollar Part and Now I'm Inventing New Swear Words"" vocabulary game and its companion, ""Throw the Wrench Across the Garage in a Fit of Rage""; and-The ""Desperate Run to the Parts Store Five Minutes Before Close"" racing game.Oh, I almost forgot about the ever-popular ""Roll to Hit Your Head on Everything Between the Floor and Ceiling"" skill check.  Come to think of it, that's exactly why this game is pretty enjoyable - all of the wrenching without any of the frustrations that come along with it.  In all seriousness, it could use a couple things (for example, removing an engine whole instead of piece-by-piece, then tearing down the engine on a stand outside the car), a bit of polish here and there and, of course, more cars and more customisation (performance parts, tuning and engine swaps would be great!), but overall, CMS 2015 stands well on its own as it is.

												I come from Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 and found that it (CM Sim 2014) was enjoyable but once I beat the game for the first time and played some of the DLC I felt like I didn't have a reason to pick the game up. When I heard about Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 being in crowdfund mode I was hesitant to put more money down as I felt like it'd be the same thing. A decent time waster until you beat the game. After looking at what they had so far I started to get excited for the title and immediately pledged enough to get the game when it was released. I received my code earlier today and began playing it. The menu is completely different and I found it to be fluid and well designed. It immediately gave me a good vibe. I quickly and eagerly created a profile and began playing. As soon as I started working on the car I automatically fell in love with how it felt. In the previous title it felt like the menus were slow and sluggish. It felt like a burden just to check my inventory. In CMS 2015, that's not the case. The keys are simple and understandable yet pay homage to the original title. Taking off and putting parts on was a breeze. I found myself immerse and even at times swearing like I was working on a real car. Not even kidding. At one point when it told me I had to replace a Piston I was like ""Man forget this game!"" yet I quickly dove into the top end and just started taring down and enjoying it. It's immersive and easy at the same time. I played for 4 hours before I could even test drive a car, but it was worth the wait. I've messed around with the Auction house and that's a great perk. I gave myself a budget and immediately surpassed it because, well 'because I can'. This game feels endless and fun. Fluid, good looking and immersive.I was how ever, disappointed in the fact that when you purchase a car on the auction house, you're required to put back what was on it. For example, I couldn't put a dual carb intake when I took off a single carb intake. It was disappointing as I am a big mechanic head, I love to be able to upgrade rather than replace. I was equally disappointed at the lack of aftermarket body parts. I was hoping for a hood scoop or two, but unfortunately nothing. These aren't game breakers though. I will still enjoy this game daily. Hopefully, they will update the game with either a DLC or a base patch that will allow you to do a motor swap in the auction cars. TL:DR version: Game is fun, fluid and immersive. Way better than 2014 and in my opinion, should be in any gear heads library, or just anyone who wants to play a good car game. Looks great as well!If you enjoyed this review please consider going to www.frostythegamer.com and following the website. We're still setting it up but I'll be posting new reviews soon!

												I almost gave thumbs down... but the game is well-made and it's very relaxing to play it.I learned a bit about car parts, but this game could have more information about parts:-what they are for-if they break what are the consequence and symptoms-how can we damage those parts (so we don't do it IRL)The game is nice, but If we learn more about mechanic this game it would be much cooler.

												This is among the few simulator games such as Euro Truck Simulator and farming simulator that actually does a good job. Game runs smoothly, has minimal bugs, well designed and is fun.Pros:+Manage your own car garage+Nice textures and models+Test driving+Garage customization+Minimal bugs and glitches+Runs at 60 fps+Developers are actively working on improving and adding features to gameNeutral:~Needs more cars (coming soon in dlc)~Would like to see more cables and parts under engine hood (bit empty atm)~Different engine types would be interesting (diesel, hybrid, older style engines, vans)Cons:(Remember the developers are actively working on this game)-Career mode could use a few more features (ranking, economy, business decisions)-Some UI improvements can be made (selling and buying multiple parts in tedious)-Main car parts are in cars however fuel lines, brake lines, radiator pipes, electrical cables etc are absent			",136,37,3,19,66,0,27

												I own an American muscle car custom garage... so the content in this game is something I'm familiar with.  I'll say that, yes this is a game... and a good one.  But, it is a casual sim and not so much like a Falcon flightsim.  For example, changing the brakes on a car is one thing, but in this game you don't have to spend time bleeding brake lines or... running brake lines or electrical lines.  In real life, gremlins in the electrical systems (wiring harness, fuses, etc) are what takes up so much of my time.  In this game... they're not even there... really (unless you count ignition wiring).  That could be a blessing or a curse because I hate testing 2 miles of insulated copper wire with a multimeter just to figure out why a car has a mysterious parasitic power drain.  In this game... you're either blessed to not have that tedium or let down without having that real sim experience.Overall, it is a fun GAME.  Little to no bugs.  I only wish the market allowed me to reference my parts list from the build order so I didn't have to go run under the car every time I forgot what suspension part I needed.Overall, I rate it an 8/10			",57,11,1,22,31,1,30

												I would really recommend Car Mechanic Simulator for everyone who is interested in cars and how they work. If you have the previous version of this game (Car Mechanic Simulator 2014) and you like it, I still recommend buying the new version since there is a significant update over last version: cars now have much more parts, engines and car bodies can be disassembled and repaired. Now in later stages of game you can buy cars, repair them and sell for profit. The game today also got a FREE content update in form of a new car to repair, the developers said there will be more free content updates. I as a car fan find this game really enjoyable and recommend this to everyone who is interested in cars.			",106,6,5,11,6,1,5

												A view from one who both enjoys driving and also swings spanners for a living.TLDR version - A very basic introduction into light vehicle components that feels like it needed another 3 months before release. CMS 2014 is more realistic in many ways - sideways evolution not revolution.Graphics are decent, sounds are reasonably realistic if simple. Music is passable for the first half hour, then gets turned off. An ingame jukebox with your own mp3 folder linked would be great.Into the reason why we play games - gameplay. The main suspension types (live axle and independant) are well represented along with engine choices. What is lacking is any customisation. Once you've put together 20 or so cars the excitement fails and you feel like you're grinding toward a goal you can't see. You cannot change parts from one car to another to improve horsepower or weight like Redline Racer 2 or similar (incidently a very good car modification game but very buggy).In my case, I was grinding for 9k experience, the point in which you can buy parling spaces to get cars from the auctions.I hit 9k, spent my 50g then went shopping at the auctions. Bought an absolute beater for far more then it was worth and took it home. Stripped, rebuilt every component I could, replaced everything else and then looked for a place to market my rebuilt ride.That's strange, I have no auction option...that's right. You can only sell the cars you buy for a set sum dependant on condition and model, not feed it back to the auction where you bought it. You get paid a minor 'restoration bonus' and actually end up almost even steven from where you started, which considering you've just spent the better part of 30-45mins rebuilding this thing is.....disappointing to say the least.This seems to underutilise the potentially exciting platform of the auction. Why couldn't we walk the lot before the auction, checking out the cars beforehand or even meet other bidders?Also on bidding, it seems a very simple but random process - you're not sure why one model car sells for more then the same model in similar condition because you're literally given no information on each unit. Zero. Can't even pan around to see how many panels are missing.Another lost oppurtunity is the test track - this could have been much larger and give the player a challenge or at least a reason not to on-sell a car but alas no. Mods are enabled so the community will probably come to the rescue but they shouldn't have to. The pan speed is excellent however not being able to do anything while draining oil or lowering/raising a car on the hoist is immensely frustrating, can't even check the job sheet.This game is worth money. How much though? To someone like me who already has a sound knowledge base on car mechanics, maybe $5-10. The content there is well done with no bugs I can see which is a pat on the back. I understand it uses DLC and I've bought a couple already, but misses clear oppurtunities to shine using platforms already existing in the game and offers little direction or encouragement to continue either doing customer jobs or rebuilding auction cars. You will get bored at less then 20 hours.If you want a better understanding of cars, this is a good start at least in names of components and different types of suspension. Some little AVIs on how the different suspensions compare to one another in practise would be great to better educate those who wish to play this game as a learning tool.A good crack at a title, but over far too quickly with little replay value.EDIT   -    After playing the 2014 complete version I must say there appears to be more tangible goals at least on the Tuning and 4WD addons, in addition to 2014 having more realistic graphics and engine components (actually has intake from filter housings to throttle bodies unlike 2015). Unfortunately 2014 has slow component removal speed and slow mouse speed and still has limited content..  The best CMS would be an amalgam of the best attributes of both with casual/hardcore mods with more complex components and tuning/mix match options			",179,42,20,39,36,2,53

tl;dr pros & cons list:I recommend you buy this game if you love cars, or want to learn more about cars!Pros:Awesome leap in graphics, game function, and quality from its sequelEasy learning curve, it guides you through what to doA good educational game for learning car partsIt's a learning experience for newbies to cars in general, like myselfA fantastic developer that keeps up with its communityNew content and updates are still coming out since it's a relatively new gameThere's a large variety of vehicles with several different engines and/or arrangements, but variety isn't introduced much until you get more XP which makes senseI'm going to list a lot of cons to balance with the pros, but don't misinterpret it, it's a fantastic game.Cons:Dubstep music on the radio, can easily be turned off howeverThe game holds your hand almost too much once you become proficient and want a challenge, since it doesn't let you mess up assembling the vehicleThere's no tutorial about how to play the game really, but it always shows you the controls and is really easy to figure out for the most partIt isn't a challenge if you're a mechanic, surprise surpriseIt doesn't show you how the parts actually work in the vehicle, if you're looking to learn about thatNow for the non-tl;dr review:It's an incredible leap in quality from Car Mechanic Simulator 2014, and I'm pleased to say it's a full fledged sequel! Everything is vastly improved, especially the graphics and game mechanics (pun intended). They've also added the ability to buy auctioned vehicles, allowing you to fix them and sell them for profit, among some other big new things. The developers are actively updating the game and listen to the requests of its fanbase which is always a great thing to see. I love a dedicated developer that keeps up to speed with its community. Also, there's a growing multitude of cars available to work on, engines have variation most of the time, and while the game has no tutorial, the learning curve is easy to get over once you figure the parts of a car out. It gives you a very easy start, then slowly gets more and more intricate as you become more proficient in your tasks. It actually gets pretty challenging sometimes.A lot of people wonder about how realistic it is, so I will go over that in the next paragraph:I'm no mechanic, so I have no real-life depiction of how realistic the game actually is, but I got an opinion from a friend of mine who really is a mechanic.The original Car Mechanic Simulator is what initially sparked my interest in how cars work, and now this sequel helps me expand on that. Hell, it got me so intrigued I went out to my car to see if I could take the air filter out! I even watched some YouTube videos on mechanics principles. I really didn't care for cars prior. In fact I knew nothing of cars. Thank this game for inspiring my love in vehicles! After talking to a mechanic friend, he does say the game lacks realistic difficulty because in reality, knowing which tools to use and finding out what is broken is only half the battle, and it holds your hand through putting things back together, as well as taking things apart in the right order. In real life, it's far more possible to forget to put something in the car, or to lose a bolt inside the engine which apparently sounds painful to a mechanic. He said you can't simply pull out some parts like the game does, too, such as a gearbox. Also, the engines it has you work on aren't as wildly varying as real life cars. My car engine has many of the parts the game has, and thanks to the game I could identify a few of the things which felt very satisfying since I had literally no knowledge of it prior. Everything was arranged differently than in the game, though. It's possibly true that the game isn't quite spot-on realistic, however there's nothing I know of that's better at teaching you the parts of a car and how cars work. With the incredible leap in game quality in just one year, I wouldn't be surprised if it'll be marginally closer to real life in the next sequel. I'm not IGN and I give this a 10/10, so that should say something! It was well worth the 16 dollars I spent, as you can't put a price on education and inspiration. ",43,5,3,7,11,0,14

												So I loved 2014 - Thought it was great but a bit limited.2015 brings a lot more to the game and it's great!... However...The Title credits say its from Poland - I've never been there but working on cars for 30+ years, rebuilding, repairing and modifying, this game is a first for me - I've never had to remove the ENTIRE SUPSENSION to change a block. If that's the way a mechanic in Poland has to do it, they'd never make a profitable business down under. Just saying.Other than that I love it. Well..

												The whole process of repairing a car consists of apparently flying around a transparent car, clicking on rusty parts to make them disappear, and then clicking on their location again to make the shiny replacements appear. After reading its many positive reviews, I expected so much more from this game, especially in terms of realism and educational value.I expected part descriptions, detailing what they do and how they work, not just what they're called.Maybe it's my own fault for once again letting ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" convince me to buy a game I had some interest in, without researching the game's contents more thoroughly before placing my order, but here's what I imagined (apart from what was already mentioned): - Seeing the required tools in action, and maybe being able to upgrade those tools.- Part damage models. Apparently, rust is the only danger to any part, even rubber ones.- A garage management aspect, complete with running costs and equipment purchase/maintenance.- Timers on accepting contracts.- (Generous) Timers on completing accepted contracts.- Cars actually moving and not teleporting between positions.- Fewer loading screens. Way fewer.- Customer satisfaction, raised by completing repairs on time and without performing and billing unnecessary work, leading to repeat business and word of mouth advertising.- Some purpose to money (examples above)These are just off the top of my head. I was also disappointed by the poorly designed interface (e.g. not being able to close a menu with the same key that opens it) and overall extremely slow progression with no other goal than to click on the same parts on different cars and save more money, for... cars in the parking lot?I'm glad a lot of people enjoy this game, but it's not for me and probably not for people with similar preferences, which is why I wrote this review.

												If you like cars and working on them, this game is crazy addictive. Very well done. However, some quality of life improvements need implemented.-Load times are atrocious. On a modern machine, simply ridiculous in length. This needs adressed.-The newest DLC is excellent, however, the 1/4 mile needs an option to toggle between manual or automatic, or even a launch control(I realize the older cars don't have this). If you are simply keyboarding, launching a 600+HP vehicle is a terrible chore of finesse. 1/4 mile times will even drop(versus stock, slightly tuned, max tune) until you can find that sweet spot of gear manipulation just to end tire spin. Even then, times are foolishly off what they should be.-No option to toggle KPH to MPH. Small complaint, but important.-When tearing a car down, a lot of the screen is wasted space. They need to implement a menu of items and % you already have in your inventory for each part removed. Maybe something as simple as a top 3 % listing to cut down on menu swapping time. This would fit nicely into some of the empty voids on screen. Whether it shows on part removal or part replacement mode. It would improve gameplay ten folds...-Repairing items at a 90% cap is nice, but when an item is above a certain percentage, say 90-99%, breaking it shouldn't be so simple. Sometimes randomness can cause 100% of these items to break for a LONG stretch. Not a huge deal, but could be improved. Again not huge, but can be very annoying.-New DLC issue, Superchargers/intake can block distributor cap clip on the back side. Real pain even zoomed in to remove or replace.-Load times.-More variety would make it more consuming. Parking lot for customers cars waiting to be fixed(similar to a real shop). More bays. Perhaps even a staff at a certain XP level to allow more projects with less hands on; your staff does basic jobs for you(such as simple exhaust repairs/brakes/etc..) More money sinks. Custom build jobs(This may or may not be in newest DLC,if so disregard), not just repairs. Not everything needing worked on is broke. A lot of customers want a built/modified/improved car out of a perfect performing car.Overall this is an amazing game despite my minor annoyances. Amazingly fun if cars are your thing.  Would recommend to any wrench turner who plays games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Who doesn't like cars? From a beautiful Ford Mustang, to a luxury Bentley or even an eco-friendly model. Everyone likes cars, unless they don't. And being part of that gang, I thought it would be a good idea to try out this new game, and share my experience with the world.It's a never ending battle of making your cars better and also trying to be better yourself.Dale EarnhardtWithout any further delay, I present to you my review of Car Mechanic Simulator 2015.GameplayFirst of all, let me tell you something. This game will screw you with the amount of screws you'll have to unscrew and rescrew during your mechanic career.As a garage owner, your objective is, as in any other game, to make money, which will be used to upgrade that same garage, as well as to buy parts for other cars, and even to buy cars.After accepting the first job, there's a list that tells the player what's wrong with said car, and, obviously, it's up to the player to open up that car and find those parts, and replace or repair them. If you choose to replace, you can just order the piece you need online, however, if you choose to repair the piece, you'll save money, or you’ll end up breaking it.As the game goes on, and the player gains experience, which can be used to get some scanners and faster tools, those lists indicating the problem will cease to exist, and it will be up to the player to use everything available to find the problem and fix it. Plan B, which let me tell you, always works, is simply to dismantle the entire car and check every single piece, but that does take quite a while, as you can imagine.I didn't know the difference between a spark plug and a crankshaft, but now I do! So fear not if you don't know anything about the mechanical side of cars, or even anything related to cars, because you'll learn it all.Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 will bring out the mechanic in you that you never knew existed. Trust me, I'm (now) a mechanic.Pros Incredible details; Plenty of pieces, from rubber bushings to spark plugs, CMS2015 has it all; The difficulty ladder is really well designed, and the player won't feel a difference when the harder repairs come by, if anything, it will feel easier with all the practice; Some interesting tools available to help discover what needs to be fixed, from testing paths, to electronic meters, there's a nice variety to use and abuse; Intuitive job objectives that help the player to find out where the problem is, without having to dismantle the entire car (even though that's the fun part!); Nice variety of cars, with more being added in the future; No game has as many screws as CMS2015; The auction house allows the player to buy a (almost) ruined car and resell it, after it has been worked a bit, for profit.I wouldn't be surprised to see some of the ""Cons"" listed below improved in future patches/updates, but I do feel the need to point them out as they're somewhat disappointing.Cons Long loading screens, even if you're only going to visit the auction or the parking lot; The ""damaged"" details are feel very poor, since there's no broken or bent, just rust (the more rust, the more damaged the piece is!); The shadows are a bit off, especially around the lifter (I'd also like to point out the lifter doesn't appear to actually be holding the car, it's just sort of floating there).VerdictI'd give it a 8.5/10, which could easily be a 10 if the graphic quality and effects were a bit better. Nonetheless, it's a fantastic game and undoubtedly a must for any fan of the genre. Do note that the team is still active, and I'm sure the quality of the game will increase even further.Note: Despite looking quite similar to real cars, the vehicles available in game aren't actually the real ones, and it would be sweet to actually be able to work on a Ford Mustang and such, but I do understand it being extremely difficult to apply due to licensing issues.

												Decent for what it is, but marred by poor interface choices and odd limitations.  If you're a huge fan of this type of simulation, ignore everything after this and buy it anyway.  Interface awkwardness seems to be common in this sort of game.  I don't know if it's lack of playtesting or what.  ""I"" opens your inventory, but doesn't close it; that's the Escape key.  All the menus are like that.  After you buy cars at the auction, they are sent to your garage's parking lot.  Naturally, you can't go directly there from the auction.  You have to go to the main workshop (loading screen), then to the garage (loading screen), send the car to the workshop, then go back to the workshop (you guessed it! more loading screen).  I still can't think of a reason not to let me just summon the car to the lift like I'm a wizard since that's effectively what's happening anyway.  Even if it takes a single loading screen, one is better than three.The decision on what parts are seems pretty arbitrary.  Things that are just one part: Rear differential, starter motor, the entire transmission.  On the other hand the distributor cap has: ignition wires, clips to hold the cap on, the cap, the rotor, and the housing.  I'd love it if I could work on the bigger complicated parts at the workbench, or use an engine lift to pull the blessed thing out whole instead of raising and lowering the car over and over.I think the biggest disappointment for me is that it only feels like half a game.  You fix cars, but there really isn't any point to it.  Sure you get XP and money to fix *different* things on *different* cars.  It's all without any goal to it.  This game would be much improved if it were mated to a racing game.  Then I'm making money to fix up my car, buying auctioned cars for parts to my car, and using the garage to improve my car.  But nope. I'm just pulling bad parts off of a car, hitting them with a hammer until they are fixed or ruined, buying replacements for the ruined ones, and putting it all back together.  Or rather I was since I no longer play the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First and foremost: I LOVE THIS GAME. I also loved Gearhead Garage back in the 90's, and I have a background in auto repair, so I maaaaay be biased.Having played Car Mechanic Simulator 2014, I realized that this team was putting together something very special - something that rekindled a love I haven't experienced since my Gearhead Garage CD stopped working. CMS2014 (last year's game) reminds me of the CD-level release of Gearhead Garage - no auctions, limited cars, and somewhat... unfinished, I suppose. CM2015 (this year's game) is the entry that I think the developers wanted to make. It feels alive, very much so, and it feels like it has this wealth of potential just waiting to be tapped. I am honestly excited for this game in a way I'm not often excited about games.The ProsDevs are highly active in the community. Seriously, check the Steam Forums for this game, and they're engaged with players. They are actually keeping a community-created list of wanted features (and are honest about what they can't/won't include, too). VERY cool to see this from a dev team!Gorgeous graphics. The details in the textures are really nice, and the individual parts shine here. It may not break any monitors or redefine any genres, but it definitely is something my graphics card makes veeeery pretty.Customizable ""home base"" (garage). Maybe it's just a ""me thing"", but I like making it my own place.VERY detailed (and, from a parts sales guy's perspective, accurate) parts - assembly and ""fit"".Smooth Gameplay. There's definitely a rhythm you can get into, and it makes this game easy to lose hours in.The ConsSoundtrack. While I do enjoy the genre, I turned the in-game music volume down to 20 (instead of 50). This made it much easier to bear, even enjoyable. Customizable music has been suggested to the devs, and is definitely something they should pick up.Learning curve. It's a bit steep to get into the game, though if you have some background in cars it's easier. A piece of advice? Switch between the view types, particularly View 3, which shows you the condition of parts. You can take a test drive to find the condition of suspension parts.Clarity of Gameplay Direction. It's honestly more exploratory than explained to you. Poke things. Explore your environment. Open doors, play with objects... Honestly, a lot of learning is done by experience here, which either lends to the idea of a garage mechanic or breaks the game for you entirely, depending on how you look at it (I don't mind it, but I have a background in this area, so...)Honestly, it's a standard initial release as of April 24 (2-3 days after release), so the content isn't massive. There's 17 cars now, one more definitely happening, and a menu entry for ""community content"" that isn't active just yet. If this opens itself to modding... this game could easily end up being 800+ hours on my account. I absolutely love it!			",84,25,14,34,29,0,32

												This game has ruined simulator games for me, forever. Not in a bad way, mind you. This game is the absolute epitome of what a simulator game could be. It is dynamic, engaging, has a super-supportive dev community, and has a list of stuff they are patching in that lists nearly 100 user submitted ideas.  It's a puzzle game that is varied, and not super-difficult, yet it's not easy either. It's dead easy to get into, but engaging enough to let you spend hours and hours on. The DLC is more like nifty add-ons, and not core pieces of gameplay, and you could enjoy the whole game perfectly well, even if you didn't buy them. I really can't give this game anything else but a solid, and well-deserved, 10/10. As far as simulator games go, devs of other games better sit up straight, and start taking notes. This could potentially be the game that blows the whole market open, and bring in a new world of simulation sub-genres to whole new audiences. And on top of all this, it is hugely informative. I have learned the internal workings of a car, through component parts of small engines, from 4-cylinder junkers, all the way to supercharged V8 Overhead Valve muscle cars.Get this game. It's a steal, at $20. It's totally worth every single cent. This is the game, for which, I will forever compare other simulator games to. And yes, all of the others pale in comparison.

												I'm going to college to become a technician at a Subaru dealer in Colorado. I'm starting school with a very minimal range of knowledge when it comes to repairing cars. Don't get me wrong, cars have been apart of more than 50% of my daily life. My life revolves around cars, but if I wanted to be a Subaru tech, I needed the knowledge. Now I don't have the money to purchase broken cars, and fix them, but I've had to do a few things on my Subaru that really upped my knowledge (Timing belt + Water pump, Serpetine belts, Oil changes, etc...).I began searching for ways to further my knowledge; I found this game on the automechanics subreddit and it has actually been very helpful. The game itself isn't realistic in the sense that it could be a training tool for a mechanic (The bolts are incredibly unrealistic. 3/4 of the cars you work on are rusted to hell, rusted bolts should not come out that fast without penetrating sprays); but it's a fantastic tool for figuring out where certain parts of the car are. Don't know how to access, or find the pistons? Now you do. Do you not know how to diagnose certain problems with the car, without a scan tool? Now you do.I'm gonna make a pros/cons list of this game.Pros:- Very great tool for gaining knowledge of part locations- Gives you a general idea on how the car works- Graphics are amazing- Game is actually pretty fun, even if you don't want to be a mechanic- Wide selection of partsCons:- Not realistic in terms of truly repairing a car- Not a lot of variety in cars. I'd love to see semi trucks, busses, wider selection in Wagons, Sedans, SUVs, etc... ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It’s a decent game, but it’s not a real sim and its very repetitive.Why it’s not a sim (at least to me).  When I think of a simulator, i think everything should be how it actually is irl (or relatively close to it).  This game is just that, a game. Parts of the mechanic part they got right, but read on for what they didn’t...There are other reviews saying its repetitive, but I though hey, it’s a game about fixing cars... you are going to repair the same issues many times.  But it goes far beyond that. Every modern v8 - exactly the same engine.  So if you are working on the challenger knockoff or the bmw knockoff, they are identical motors.*edit* even though modern v8's in all vechicles are identical, you can't supercharge (swap) them when they are in a truck.My other gripes;Parts are invented, the 'press in' splined hub 'bearing' that is in every car... it’s actually part of the hub (the part you bolt your wheels to) and cannot be removed.Part names are made up.  in game; rear suspension arm 'x'y'z', = irl; trailing arm, rear upper/lower control arm.I really bought the game because when I played the demo there was a 'mods' section on the title screen, making me think, hey user mods for this game should be awesome!... yea... there's 1 mod... and it’s a track...Auction- no cars go unbid on.  There is always ai to bid you up on everything, and not just a few times.  The ai bids you up 20-30k in some cases.  Example; wanting to buy a GTR (not the Nissan version, some made up GTR) go to a few auctions to see what the sell for when im not bidding.  30k-42k. seems like a decent price.  go to a fresh auction and start trying to buy one.  Lowest I have gotten one is 53k highest was 62k, where is my 30k GTR?Rex, when I’m not bidding 32k.  When I’m bidding 50-60k.Overall, then game has a lot of potential but it’s not at all what I had hoped for.I would still recommend the game if you know nothing about cars, as this will teach you a lot (just don’t pay attention to the names of the suspension parts).

												While fun at first, the game gets very repetitive and, frankly, boring after some time. I believe this game will only be fun to someone who doesn't know much about cars and their maintenance.First, I played on normal difficulty - dropped it quickly, too easy.Then expert difficulty - still too easy. Incidentally, removing parts of the user interface is just annoying, and not difficult (e.g. money and xp).The devs would need to do something about it to make the game more challenging. Call it master difficulty:  Re-assembly is way too easy with assisted ordering and highlighting. I mean, if you forgot to put something in - it should stay forgotten. And if you're finishing an order, game shouldn't kindly tell you that you've forgotten some crucial part somewhere. A true mechanic should face the consequences! Be it money or warranty work.  Damage/wear model is too simple, just rust or certain belt marks. And there should some kind of 'fog of war' for rust, otherwise it's too easy to spot rusty parts.  Want to get really technical? Lay out OBD in full: fault codes, oxygen sensor data, fuel trims, air data! And graphs too!  Out of all different engine liquids, there's only oil now. Well, should be more, with level checks, certain type of damange (leaking), etc.  Greases? A good portion of car mechanics is about greases. Of course, this one is hard to implement in a game reasonably.  Car problems are a bit random. IRL physical problems are often localized: i.e. you struck a wheel on something - a wheel and local suspension parts would be affected. And IRL engine problems are often conceptually connected: for example, a low level of engine coolant would lead to overheating, worsening oil state and inducing piston wear, etc.  Payment should reflect the work required. My impression is that in CMS 2015 your bonus (i.e. profit) depends on the part costs, and not on work required to get to those parts.Also, I've seen CMS 2014 having repair order comments like ""I lent the car to my wife, and now my suspension is ruined!"" That was a nice touch, pity there's nothing like this in CMS 2015.			",63,12,2,6,2,0,3

There's no timers so you can take as long as you need to fix a car.  You can't really lose at this game, but you'll still be mildly challenged.			",706,228,31,69,147,11,98

												This is one of the greatest kickstarter games I've ever seen. I played CMS 2014 to remind myself great times when I was ""wasting"" my life in Gearhead Garage but unfortunately it was only like demo version of it. CMS 2015 is completely different - whatever was good in 2014 is still here but many features were developed further. There is more cars, more parts - more of everything. And finally we can go to auction and pimp wrecks to collect them or for sale. Graphics are brilliant for such low budget product. You can do OBD scanner tests, test drive or measure electrical performance of various components. It's a perfect sim for all moto-fans. Recommended and Kudos to polish developer.			",15,2,3,5,12,0,4

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 has become one of my favorite games to play, I just can't quit playing it. The main thing that makes this game fantastic is that it is extremely educational. I began mechanically ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and actually learned a whole lot about the functions of a vehicle.Pros: - Beautiful graphics.- Good car selection. (clearly knockoffs, but you can take a good stab at what they represent)- Plenty of parts to disassemble and reassemble.- Doesn't just hold your hand and tell you every move to make. (Some may not consider that a pro)- Is definitely realistic, and now I can trust myself to change sparkplugs. :pCons:- I learned from this game that the key way to identify a messed up car part is to find the absolutely rusted-over part, and remove it. I believe that if the creator(s) were to create cracked, dented, crushed, and other affects to try to identify, that it would be a little less cheesy, and a lot more challenging.- No trucks. I will live until this issue is fixed though. :)- No transmission repair. I feel as if the game has very in-depth repair abilities, such as being able to gut out an engine and lift the whole thing out, but as far as gearbox operations, you don't get to jack with the transmission at all, you only have to replace or repair the gearbox as a whole without messing with the transmission or the overall mechanism inside of the gearbox itself. (I STRONGLY DESIRE THE ABILITY TO DO THIS)9/10 Absolutely recommended, would be 10/10 if it weren't for a few minor things like what I mentioned above.			",64,4,1,7,3,0,3

												I highly recommend this game, particularly for the educational element.  I got this game in a Humble Bundle, and after recent adventures with doing a bit of DIY with replacing my IRL car's fuel pump, I wanted to try out this sim game.  I'm now 31 hours in across 4 days.  This game is very, very addicting (at first), but extremely grindy.  Each part installed counts as 1 experience, and it's not until 9000 experience do you get to start building/selling customs.But there's a specific reason why, this game is very newbie friendly, and as you gain the in-game experience, you become more and more familiar with parts, ""feel"", damage appearance, what tests to use to identify what, what part is likely damaged when a customer reports an issue with X, and what is most ""cost efficient"" when repairing a car.You have very few diagnostic tools in the beginning (these have to be leveled up for, 1000 exp gets you 1 upgrade point, or one tool), so you are forced to do the diagnostics with visual identification and on a test track.This game is not for advanced mechanics, or people looking to build/race customs.  It is very much for people who don't really know much about cars to learn (at a basic level) how a car is put together.Prior to this game, I had a very rudimentary knowledge of how a car works, the most advanced thing I've done IRL is install a new fuel sending unit in an old Sentra.  From playing this game, I've learned names of a lot of different parts (you do the same repairs enough that you end up remembering them), and learned how to identify when a car is suffering from issues at different parts across the board.Once you reach around 5000 exp though you may get bored, I stuck it out and went to 9K to see what building a custom was like, and while it's fun, you can't do too much with them except compare performance with other players in the Steam forums, or sell them back to the shop for extra money.I will likely buy the DLC when it goes on sale, but for now it's a bit too much $ for what is offered.Also, get the car name mod from one of the guides, it converts the in-game names to their IRL counterparts.

I spent 45 minutes removing piece by piece of the engine block until I had reduced the thing to just a chassis and its suspension, and still I couldn't figure out what part was causing the issue. I started taking the entire truck apart, and about an hour in, I discovered that the air filter compartment's lid was busted.I made $20.Surely, this is the most realistic car mechanic simulator in the world.

												I won't claim to know everything about cars, I would struggle to fix a car if someone gave me a step by step 'Fixing a car for dummies' book. That said, this is a good start for anyone remotely interested in fixing/repairing/replacing parts. While there are some things I could criticize, like the 'instructions not clear enough - private parts stuck in engine block' tutorial, it's quite easy to get into and play with little hand-holding. The part repair system could use a little work imho, the paint shop seems a bit redundant at times, the auction camera needs a bit of fixing, and some other small things.Overall for a game of this style, having that balance between a gearhead's game and a general indie style game is hard to get right. This game gets it right. It has enough depth and detail to actually make me stop and think about what I'm doing and what steps I should take to complete the repair, but not too much that I have to call my mechanic friends/family and ask them what I need to do.The game is easy to get into and very fun to play, again balancing gameplay and detail/realism. The number of times I've had to replace a crankshaft after I've already taken apart the clutch housing and reassembled it......There are a few things that needed work, but mostly just quality of life improvements that could be changed/added in a patch. No major problems to speak of.I wish some of the 2014 features were there, like the sense of progression from a garage to a multi-car shop, or the 'replace the missing parts from my new used car purchase'.Yes you will replace brakes a thousand times, yes you will change thousands of filters, yes you will find the same problems coming up time after time. This is the life of a mechanic. Cars need brakes, cars need new filters, mechanical things break, and often times it's the same things that break. I would recommend that you see the 'monotony' as a more realistic representation of how it is to fix cars in a shop. Your car will need new oil, it will need a new timing belt at least once in its life, it's just a fact to live with.The thing I personally like, having recently gotten to that point, is once you can purchase a parking garage and go to the auto auction to purchase broken down piles of scrap, and turn them into like-new beauties to sell. The trailer/intro video shows this, starting with a car that may be missing half of the body, trying to repair as many parts as possible to save money, and buying what you can't fix. By the end you can decide whether to just replace the really bad parts, or completely renovate the body, engine, and suspension to brand new quality. It adds a sense of accomplishment to the end game (which some may say is desperately needed after changing 1000 brake pads), and keeps you playing.TL;DR: It can be boring, but it's worth it to anyone even remotely interested in cars. Just buy it. (Though if still in doubt - wait for a sale, $20 USD may be a bit steep for some)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a wonderful mix of an intro to car components and a D&D dystopia.Instead of making different parts show that they are worn and broken using a variety of techniques, the game uses only one. RUST.So imagine we are handed a relatively new car that has some suspension problems. We pop the car on a lift, take a look at the undercarriage, and we find pristine parts, right next to others that look like they've been randomly touched by a rust monster. This makes the game into quite the amusing ""find the rust"" quest.Added hilarity comes from antique muscle cars. I've opened the hood just to find an engine that must have been submerged in the ocean for 100 years. You want me to fix your engine? The engine block is made out of rust! There are a whole 5 push rods and two spark plugs that are in sensible shape! But the customer is the customer, and we get to disassemble the entire engine, but 40+ new parts, and somehow put them together, with new pristine parts next to others that somehow, despite being quite rusty, do not need a change. Yes sir, I'll only change 5 pistons, even though the other 3 are at 30%. I am sure you want to pay for another mechanic to rebuild your engine again in a year when those old parts fail, right?The game's biggest issues today are the fact that the game refuses to list the defective parts when I am in front of the computer, ordering replacements, so I either have to use paper, or just make multiple trips to the in-game parts store (Just imagine how long that would take IRL if a mechanic did something like that). The second issue is that the game wants you to replace the broken parts with newer ones that meet specs, but it has to be in the exact same position. So, say that we have an 8 cylinder engine, with its 16 pull rods. 5 of them are broken and need replacement. the rest do not, but they are so used they are not good as replacements. We also have to change the crankshaft, which involves removing the engine heads where the pull rods fit. So after we disassemble everything, and put on the new crankshaft, and put the engine heads back, then comes the game of trying to figure out which location to put the new pull rods, as we've already taken all of them out. So I end up pushing O a lot, and seeing if, after placing a new part, the game actually thinks it counts as a repair. if it doesn't, I have to take the part out again, and then put an old one, Repeat until you find all the new replacements, or just give up, and purchase all the parts new.Overall, it's a fun game, as long as you don't take it too seriously. Highly recommended.			",276,150,5,52,49,3,67

												I recieved CMS 2015 in a Humble Bundle, frankly I was pondering not even activating it on my account since I have zero interest in cars in real life. However, I figured ""hey why not?"".I was pleased to find a very addictive experience that I hadn't expected. Though the flaws began to show themselves soon enough. After enough ours patching up the same cars over and over again I wondered why there wasn't more to the game. That's when I discovered the DLC page. Basically all the fun mechanics in the game are tucked away as DLC addons, such as being able to buy your own cars, clean them up and then either store them or sell them for a huge profit. Even the (in my view) BASIC feature of being able to swap out engines was unavailable unless you purchased a DLC pack.Not sure why all of these Simulators feel like they have to cut out vital components in their games or not add them at all until a later date so they can release them as DLC is a must. Frankly it's kinda annoying getting a game only to find that you have to buy 5+ packs of additional content to get the full experience.Even so the options in CMS 2015 are limited, I bought nearly all of their DLC because I found the game far more engaging that I thought it would be. However, I must be honest and say that I've got quite a bit of buyers remorse after that.At first I would've given CMS 2015 an 8/10 but after noticing the chopped-up nature of the game, the lack of features to keep you engaged... I'd say this game isn't worth more than a 5/10 at most.			",119,25,1,18,29,1,35

												Probably the best sim game there is in fixing cars. I work as a mechanic in real lif and this game is a good way to learn the parts, how they work and kind of shows you how to fix them. My friends have played this and said they feel they've learnt more about cars. Plus being able restore cars and turn a profit and also having the ability if you buy the DLC to tune the cars and do drag runs. Probably one of the best car mechanic sims i've played and i recommend buying this game.			",3,1,4,1,11,0,0

												Playway has really done a great job with this one. I enjoyed CMS2014 but they managed to build on that and improve it in almost every way. And all with Kickstarter and a low pledge goal. As the name implies you run an auto shop repair business. But new and improved for 2015 are the cars have many more parts now and the repairs are a good deal more involved. You also earn XP now as you work and complete jobs which can be used to unlock more advanced diagnostic tools like the test path, OBD scanner, compression tester etc and other repair abilities. There is also an unlockable paint shop now as well so you can do body and paint work and an auction house where you can buy junk cars for parts or fix them up and sell them for profit. Once you earn enough to get the extra parking lot, you can store your cars for service or just collect them. Customers call in on the phone with jobs you can take or decline. An all new better organized parts shop and tablet access eliminates running back and forth to the computer to buy parts.Test driving the vehicle now and using your diagnostic tools generates a parts list condition report for certain systems saving you time poking around and disassembling the vehicle looking for bad parts.All in all there's quite a bit to do and highly recommended if you like puzzle games, working on cars, or are a simulator fan.

												I've played this game a little bit, and don't get me wrong, the premise of the game is great. It's a barebones, basic simulator of what it can be like to work on cars. As a schooling technician, this game is a fun time waster and it has just enough vagueness to keep it from feeling like actual work.However, this game is a DLC generator. There has not been any actual progress on the game in a very, very long time. They will add one or two cars with very little variation between the previous vehicles in the game. A new engine model but that's kind of useless when it's all visuals. In the early days, they talked about adding all sorts of features, only to later tell they were limited by the game engine in what they can do. It really bums me out because this game had SO much potential to be ""more than your average simulator"", it had potential to be something great enough to be raved about, but I do not see the effort being put forward to improve the game anymore. It's just a DLC of a couple cars every few months. Because of that, I find myself playing other games more often than this one these days.This game is a good game to play and zone out while doing so (if you really understand the cars) or an interesting abstract puzzle game, however I can only recommend it to someone so long as they know that actual improvements or content is pretty much gone with the wind at this point.

												I love this game. Period.I don't know much about cars, and even though I always enjoyed car tycoon games, I never really got into any ""mechanic simulator"". Until now. This is pretty much a 3D puzzle connected with company (car garage in this case) management.You get to repair the cars, earn money, and then improve the garage. On top of this you can purchase old, ruined cars on atucion, and bring them back to life to either sell them, or... have your own collection. And yes - you can test drive the cars (which is sometimes necessary in order to know what's wrong with a car).I really enjoy this game, and can absolutely recommend it.			",45,16,3,21,45,0,19

												This game is basicly a open free play at game start. Your abilty in the game is outstanding, you gain experince points, having thoses points makes it possable to get things, you can take jobs or reject jobs, you can not only do auto repair, but go to the auction and get cars to restore. The game is not a auto training simulator, there are no software training simulators for auto mechanics, you would need to see a tech school for that because it is hands on training. How ever the diganostics on the car for a failing part is on the mark for the most part of what got broken and needs to be replaced. If you never worked on a car ever, here you will get to see what the parts names are and were they go, so yeah it could be said you will learn the very basic bases of auto mechanics.If your a mechnic who likes to play around with car repair games, a person who is into cars, anyone who is adicted to cars, I would recomend this game. Check out the guides section in the fourm and look for ""Auto Repair Manual Class for Car Mechanic Simulator 2015"" Why this guide? Because at the very end of the guide at the bottom it has Tutorial Videos of the in's and out's of what is expected in the game and maybe of intresst to you to see what is going on in the game! They are sectioned off with titles on each video making it possable for you to choose what you want to see. Some vids may have more than one part, there was alot to cover.. Hope this helps..

Somewhere along the history of video games, a beautiful little too-weird-to-live yet too-rare-to-die niche genre was born. Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is smack-dab in the middle of this genre, and can be described as a zen-like puzzler that is an incredibly slow burner. This game will require many hours from you, and will satisfy and reward you the whole way.Essentially, you manage a mechanics garage. The whole thing. You answer calls, take jobs, and fix cars (among other things). You can repair parts, or order new. You can let jobs pile up, or solve one at a time. Each job is very much a puzzle. The better you are, the quicker you advance. The more you advance, the better swag/tools/speed/etc. you get. It has RPG elements like that. The music is great, too.Pros:+Utterly addicting, in all the right ways.+Beautiful graphics, and great music to fit.+Metric tons of gameplay in here. +If you are familiar with automotive anatomy, it will help some, but don't let that scare away people that are unfamiliar: its easy to learn.+Controls are smooth and intuitive after the first 20 minutes or so.Cons:-This is the kind of game (I think) that is best chipped away at an hour a day or so (probably like EuroTruck Simulator). Its a slow burner. You need to invest alot of time to really get somewhere. Not necessarily a 'con', but you should be aware. It isn't instant gratification.I got it on sale, but I think its worth full price for most people (if you are looking into it, its probably for you). Its amazing and beautiful how video games can be brilliantly built out of mundane and simple ideas.Peace,			",561,161,5,75,79,8,72

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Every one of us knows about cars to a certain degree. Well, we know which brands of car we like, what shape we like, what features they have and mostly we love to drive them (must be a minimum of 16 years old to do so). That is probably the extent most of us really know about automobiles. Well, Thanks to Car Mechanic Simulator 2015, you will expand your knowledge of one of the biggest inventions of the nineteen century!Car Mechanic simulator 2015 is a car simulation/ racing / puzzle game. In this game, you are going to take control of a very busy garage. Your phone is going to ring constantly and you will receive a lot jobs to repair cars (mechanics and body work); engine, brakes, suspensions, gearbox, axles or the body of the car. After you accept the job (you will have a full description of the job), you will have to get your hands dirty and reach the part to be replaced. You can’t really miss it, it will be rusty (red). One of the interesting aspects of the job description is that you have to make sure that all parts you replace are of a certain condition (eg above 70%). Well, if you buy the part it would fine but sometimes you might decide to use the repair table to save some money. Let’s say you decide to replace the faulty part with a brand new one and decide to order the part using your desktop. You will have five suppliers and one bank. Each supplier will be a specialist and the bank will be here if you need a loan. At the end of each job, you will earn money (thank god for that, you see the price of some parts. . . pretty steep) and experience points. As you gain experience, you will be able to accept bigger jobs and each time you reach 1,000 XP you will be given an upgrade point which you can use to get better tools or customize your garage. Xp will also give you access to upgrade you garage with very important features; such as a paint shop. If you feel the urge to take a break from the chaotic work, why don’t you take a car for a spin or go to the auction (you must upgrade your garage with a carpark before you can go to the auction). The layout of the garage is well designed and you can see everything a garage has to offer – car lifter, tools, garage doors - but no calendar (you know those calendars that have picture of a woman without much on sitting on a car bonnet looking rather suggestive).The graphics are really good and the controls are a combination of keyboard / mouse and are easy to use and understand. The soundtrack is absolutely stunning, too.This game is really impressive to be honest with you. Whether you are a petrol head or not, it is really enjoyable to play. It might be a bit repetitive, but it’s fun! Positives:~~~~~~~ -	Good graphics-	Garage is very well laid out and can be customized-	Easy to follow jobs in hand-	Plenty of content and DLC-	Great soundtrackNegatives:~~~~~~~~-	No achievement or trading cards-	A bit repetitiveCar Mechanic Simulator 2015 is a well thought-out game.8/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

												Have to give this one a cautious thumbs up. There aren't enough customization options in the base game, and the game is a bit over-monetized. That said, it still plays pretty well and has a fairly good feel to it. It does have a couple of issues that I'll correct right now... 1. the radio is under the window cill behind the Right Lift. 2. The unlockable diagonistic tools can be activated using F1-F3 when in examine mode when looking at the engine. I didn't discover this until 100+ hours into the game. So except for those usability fails, it's a pretty interesting game... Has an issue with part identification in expert mode tho, ie there's no manual to refer to to figure out which part to put on a car if you sold the old ones too soon.			",16,5,2,11,8,0,6

I have thouroghly enjoyed several new aspects of the game. The fact that the camera is easier to control and doesn't snap or go to awkward angles like it did in CMS 14 is a huge plus for me. I also love that you can take a motor alll the way down to the block and rebuild it. Heck you can strip the whole car down and rebuid, I'm loving how in depth they have gone with this new release.

												""CMS 2015"" is like ""CMS 2014"", only it's shinier and has more stuff to do.  I'm admittedly not very good with cars but yet still enjoyed my time with it.  ""CMS 2014"" featured static levels whereas this one seems to throw random jobs at you, which you can either take or reject on a whim (which is great).  I would have liked some sort of difficulty gauge on how hard jobs are before you accept them, that is...something to tell you that you have to take 15 parts off the car as opposed to 2 before getting to the part you need to replace.  Some may be able to say, ""oh, that's just a catalytic capacitor radiator thingy...an easy fix""...I can't do that.  A color palette box in the showroom would have been nice too (instead you have to toggle through colors), but this is minor.  There's lots of play time to be had here, especially if you don't know what you're doing.  An easy recommend!

It can get repetitive after about 16h (I played more than 30 already and still have lots of fun), but it is actively developed and almost every week (and sometimes even more often) there is something new to see in the game and also after you explore all the content available at the moment game is still relaxing and fun so I find myself running it just to play for about half an hour, fix a car of two, and relax a little. I highly recommend this game. It is very well done technologically, constantly improved in terms of gameplay and replayability and has very good support and contact with the developer. Almost every thread on steam forums has a developer answer, and some of the suggestions were implemented in the game in literally few days from being first posted.

I played this game for a while and I looked under the hood of my car and I recognize the parts and their functions because of this game. Load times are sometimes long especially when the garage is full of cars but understandable since there are probably many parts the game is keeping track of. It would be great if there are more real auto manufacturers that would add their vehicles.This game can be played for a few minutes and even while I watch movies.

												Good game. It does what it was designed to do very well, if you like cars, and sims. I found it pretty relaxing taking cars apart and putting them back together. That said, here's a summary of what I think are the strong and weak points of this game:Pros:Unique idea (to me anyway), running your own garageNicely rendered cars and mechanically logical design/engineeringFun upgrades to your workshop can be added (e.g. custom colors from your spray booth)Cons:Greater role-playing elements would make this good game greatDon't really see the purpose of the ""test track""Limited toolbox upgrades -- I have so many upgrade points and can't do anything with themMinor grouse -- slow loading times, especially to auction, parking, garage, etc. surely this can be improved?Music was driving me batty after a while, but you can shut it offGets repetitive after a while, especially without new cars, challenges, etc., which meansLimited replay value, unless you find taking cars apart relaxing, like meI know there are more cons than pros, but the weight of the pros is higher than the cons. I had fun. Worth getting -- even more so if on sale.7.5/10 ",11,11,1,22,8,0,16

												I'm on the fence about this one. I think Car Mechanic Simulator is a tremendous first step, however it ultimately fell short of what I was hoping for.The game boils down to an interactive set of 3d car models. These models allow you to disassemble and reassemble engines, drive trains, and so on. This is definitely neat, but in itself only has so much enjoyment before things get repetitive. The illusion of running a repair shop almost works but the finer points of running a business are completely lost. There are always more customers waiting, no matter how long you take, or how poorly you did. Diagnosing problems seems almost trivial, just look for rusty components as you wrench things apart. I want to like this, but I ran out of challenges a while ago. All that remains is the grind of XP and money.This game needs more of something. I would personally love to see engine tuning and performance simulated to some degree. Other options would be expanding the business model of running a repair shop, or perhaps adding more realism to the repairs themselves. A broken part isn't just a rust texture after all.

												I owe a lot to this game. I grew up not knowing a thing about cars. I picked this game up on a whim, and it got me over my fear of messing around with my semi-broken car. I learned where things typically are, and what they do in a car. I have saved myself and my friends and family probably hundreds, if not thousands of dollars in vehicular repair. I even managed to fix a broken lawnmower by extrapolating from what I learned here! Using this as a general guide and supplementing knowledge with YouTube channels has, in my mind, made me somewhat competent when dealing with these things. I am by no means a mechanic or an engineer, and this game will not give you the didactic knowledge that is required of those professions, but it has taught me fundamentals. Fundamentals that are worth far, far beyond the asking price of this game/virtual tutorial. Words cannot describe how much  I appreciate the experience that Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 has given me. I can't say it is particularly ""fun"". I could see how you would have fun with it, but the overall management experience of it is, in my humble opinion, a little weak. That isn't the point, though. If you have any interest in working on cars, you owe it to yourself to get this game.			",294,102,3,118,33,0,51

												This game is truly what every gear-head has been waiting for. Virtually running your own shop - with a few things missing. I would LOVE to make a few suggestions for the next release so that it would suite not only my own preferences as a Diesel Mechanic, but those as a gamer. Pros:Smooth, flawless gameplay. No bugs worth remembering.BEAUTIFUL textures. The ability to diagnose with different tools. Decent car variety (for what the game is)Auctions!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Build for profit!!!!!!!!!!!!!Pick what jobs you want to do!Immersive gameplay.Cons:Some things that should need bolts or nuts, don't have them. Making removal easy.Random pulleys.... (really urks me that the belt is being bent in a way for no purpose other than aesthetics)No A/C Systems in any cars (would be a fun thing to troubleshoot)What happened to intake hoses/tubing?Driveshaft removal in something that is rear-wheel drive is WONKY.ignition coils can only be seen if you hover over them (possible bug)Body work system is weird, sometimes get a work order for replacing panels for a vehicle with no paint job, but panels are same color as car. (wtf?)Music........ oh my god the ♥♥♥♥ing music. Suggestions:Advertise this product more for a bigger budget on the next version (you guys are onto something)More varieties of things to diagnose and troubleshoot (like oil/coolant/fuel leaks)Add nuts/bolts to things that would typically be bolted down to an engine (like an intake on the older V8)Employees?Don't let this series die.... please........ pretty please..... 2016?!?!

Product received for free
Fixing cars without a messDo you like cars? Or are you interested in knowing more about car parts? Or are you just looking for a relaxing game where you dismantle stuff and build them again? Whatever your reason is Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 let's you do it wihout a mess.Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is a fun, relaxing game where you fix and tune different kind of cars for you to earn money by fixing them or by selling them. As the name of the game may suggest it's quite realistic in terms of being a video game. You can fix cars, test drive them, use different kinds of equipement to look for problems in the car. Do not expect any kind of sick street racing with this game because it's pretty much just fixing cars. But a fun game at that.There are some things I have to criticize though about the gameplay and the game itself. The loading times are absolutely horrendous. No matter how powerful computer you got the loading times will be a pain in the ♥♥♥. The other things that I had problem with the early-game gmaeplay. It takes quite a long time to reach even remotely interesting jobs. The first cars you'll be fixing in the first 4 hours or so will be very easy and won't earn you enough EXP or money to make them worthwhile doing. But you are stuck with them. But fortunately after a couple of hours the gameplay gets more interesting in terms of getting longer and more difficult jobs that actually make you think what you need to fix first. Unfortunately I can see people stepping away from the game in the first couple of hours because of the boring fixing jobs it offers.Overall, Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is a very fun game. It may not be the most difficult one but it certainly is a change of pace compared to other games on the market. Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 actually taught me more about car parts than anything else to this point. Certainly I'm no master mechanic just by playing this game but it certainly gives a bit more clear image of how cars work and what parts there are inside them. Fun and relaxing experience suitable for everyone.For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!

												This game is absolutely relaxing. If you played and liked CMS2014, you will DEFINITELY love this game.Pros:= More parts! this means more detail in the disassembly and repair of cars= BEAUTIFUL! The graphics may not be GTA V, but they are certainly delightful!= OWNING cars! This is a feature that pretty much everyone wished was in the last game.= Active devs! The devs are on pretty  much EVERY DAY to help diagnose bugs and help players have a better experience.Cons:= It's a simulator. This may not be your type of game= Very detailed. While this may be a pro to some, it can quickly become a con to those who don't know cars.= Slow. Not in performance, but gameplay. It may take some time to diagnose a car, and then even more time to fix it!Overall, I would definitely recommend this game. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it certainly is mine!8/10 from me!~ WireBound			",113,26,5,11,33,1,10

												You don't have to be a car enthusiast to enjoy this game.  If a 3D puzzle/forensic/tycoon game hybrid appeals to you, you might like CMS 2015. I call AAA to jump my battery, and my eyes glaze over when people talk bout cars, but I was surprised how much joy I got from buying a rusty junker, taking it apart, and either repairing or replacing all of its parts to make it practically brand new.------PROS____+ Gentle learning curve. I felt like an idiot for the first couple minutes, but even after just the second repair job, I felt a rewarding sense of growth in my abilities.  I don't like working too hard for a game (there's real life for that!), but I get bored when games are too easy, and CMS 2015 hits that sweet spot between boredom and frustration.+3D puzzle/forensic/tycoon game hybrid.+ Great music. If you end up buying this game, make sure to walk over to the radio, turn it on, and flip the stations.  I'd pay for at least one of the tracks they play on the game's radio.+ Active developers as of 4/2015. They seem to respond pretty fast to reported bugs, patch minor gameplay updates that significantly improve the gaming experience, and actually post upcoming plans for future updates.-------CONS-------+ Longer loading screens than I would've expected, but nothing too frustrating+ Getting enough experience points and money to get to the more fun parts of the game (going to auctions to buy a junker and build your own car/s, upgrades for work efficiency, etc) might take a bit too long for impatient gamers.

												I'll recommend this game because I had fun playing it and it's a better game than I could ever make, but just beware this is far from reality (more of a game than simulator). After a while I got annoyed with some minor things: The loading times in this game are absolutely terrible, as others have already mentioned. The sound effects get old pretty quick (sounds like breaking glass every time you remove a bolt or part), can be fixed by turning your sound off but I'd rather have more variety. The jobs get repetitive, but this happens in real life too (90% of the jobs I received were brake and timing related) The automatic mouse centering is pretty annoying every time you open a menu It lacks a lot of realistic parts to be a simulator (transmission gears, more body options, missing almost every electronic part besides the ignition and battery, torque specs, etc) but I suppose someone could fix this with a mod or something. No Steam achievements (could be some for fully restoring a car, completing certain number of jobs etc) Everything ""damaged"" is rusted so it's pretty obvious to find the problems without running any diagnosticsI didn't do much with the 1/4 mile strip since each time I went there it was terrible on keyboard and the loading times just weren't worth it. The only thing I ever left the garage for was the auctions and even those just ticked me off. Who would want to pay $50,000 for a rusted piece of garbage that they're only going to get $70,000 after fully restoring it? They should make the bidding system a bit more realistic too..Other than that I liked the game, the DLC make it much more enjoyable once you run out of things to do. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got the game with all DLC on the sale. I liked the business idea in the gamedescription and as it was on sale, I was like, lets try this!However, now I reached a point where there isnt really much to do and some features that dissapoint me:Managed to unluck all shop options (paint, testing, parking etc.). Once I got the parking, I bought some cars and only just fixing the body could get me some good profits, if I got the car at the right price. Bought 2 cars I totally rebuild with new parts, one with tuner and performance parts, which I kept. Took it to the dragracing and found out I be racing just myself. So exciting! Also modding the looks of your car is pretty dissapointing. GTA V, which has this not as a core part of their game, offers more paint, rims and other options to change the looks of your vehicle than this game.So now, I dont need money as I got everything, modding a car isnt interesting as I can choose one or two different bumpers and painting a car kinda sucks (no preview and can only paint a car in 1 color, no decals).Buy this game if:- You like replacing carparts over and over againDo not buy this game if:- You like business sims- You like to pimp cars ",122,10,10,15,37,3,8

												821 HP Tempest Magnum cuts a 10.390 with best launch achieved using a keyboard. 10.440 if I start in 2nd.Also after building the thing to hell I noticed in the loading art a DOHC V8 is being dropped into the magnum (but I can't do that, only OHV swaps).Tips from a beginner:- 9000xp is a grind, but the game gets a lot more fun once you have a garage and can hit the auction up- Buying a 1/5 star auction score and restoring to 100% perfect seems to rack up faster profits than answering the phone (or at least it is more interesting)- Save your cash for 9000xp+- Repair upgrades will save you quite a bit of cash, max asap- Carb and EFI tuning: get 2-3 bars lined up then work the last one to 18% while incrementing the 2-3 together9/10 will be doing more (haven't even began working the DOHC V8's yet, 50 hours in, 400k~ cash as of this comment).For the devs: the 10/10 would come if I could swap nearly any engine into any thing without having to modify the game files (with some sensibility, but a V8 maluch sounds like a blast). Also more modding and tuning options would help (11/10 if I can turbo or twin turbo anything). Most under carriage do not seem to collide the exhaust in any way with the drive train, so customized exhaust could be possibility too? 12/10 for addict DLC that includes all of this.

												The game itself isn't going to really teach you much about cars or trucks that you can take and apply to the real world. You will learn some basic names and functions that are pretty basic so I wouldn't really call it much of a sim. It doesn't take long to reach the maximum level and money isn't a real obstacle once you can afford to buy, repair/upgrade, and sell your first vehicle.Where this game becomes a gem though is how relaxing it is. It has good music and decent graphics that you don't get tired of looking at. Everything is straight forward and not hard to figure out. More and more options and car varieties come out to keep you entertained. Where the game is now (May 15, 2016) is pretty great. You have a drag strip (super cars struggle a bit here) and a Dyno setup to help ""tune"" your car to maximum performance. You have a small but nice variety of cosmetic options to make your car more valuable and unique. This plus all of the original features gives you a game you can sink a couple of hours into here and there to build up your personal collection and your bank account.All in all, I would give this an 8/10 atm. The game is great, don't get me wrong. Hardly any bugs and plenty of fun. But it could always use more. More cosmetics, more cars, garage expansions, and possibly some sort of multiplayer whether that be in the form of racing or a collection showcase. Either way it is definitely worth the money, and getting all of the DLC when it goes on sale is a must!			",83,8,1,24,25,0,23

												CMS 15 was the first title I played in the series and so far It's incredible fun. At first I was skeptical because I'm not all for simulators but to put it in short, I called in to work to play this non stop for 14 hours. Evidence enough?The huge plus for this is that the developers actually listen to the feedback and it's astounding. For instance, they released an update on Monday 4/27/15 that introduced tablets but unfortunately that followed a few bugs that altered the quality of the new features and within 8 hours of reporting the bug they had already released a hotfix.Overall, it's a great game and is worth every penny!

												Read the reviews, felt a tad let down that as an early adopter of CMS: 2014 there was no incentives given for adopting CMS: 2015 early, however I overcame these feelings and decided to give the game a go.If you enjoyed 2014, 2015 will not fail to keep you entertained. Only played the classic mode thus far and it's still brilliant. It's nice to get a list of items that you'll need to replace given to you. I also appreciate that far more parts are now removable and will need to be replaced.I do not recommend this game to anyone that can't appreciate a decent ""mong out"" style game. Anyone that found EuroTruck Simulator 2 enjoyable should find this to be a blast. If you couldn't appreciate the simple beauty of that game, this one will lose your interest quickly.

												Wow, finally a developer that looks at all of the weak points of a previous title and improves upon them - this game has exceeded my expectations so far (only 1.8 hours played at time of posting).I was so excited for this game when I saw it announced on Kickstarter. I didn't even think twice, of course I backed it, 2014 was such a great game. The idea of Car Mechanic Simulator is a very easy one to understand - I absolutely love tinkering with my real life car so naturally you would think this game is made for someone like me who is looking for a cheaper alternative to modding real cars, I would actually disagree with that. I find that this game has a wider market than people first think - the hunt for that last broken part and the race to get the funds for a bigger garage or that new part for the car you picked up at auction last week adds both puzzle and RPG elements that a lot of gamers will be familiar with and will enjoy.The game itself plays incredibly well and the new menus are gorgeous, very simple and straightforward, the controls have also been fine-tuned leaving the finished product feeling much better and in turn even more fun to play.Anyone that has played 2014 and liked it, even just a little bit, should definitely pick this up - let's keep supporting the creators and hopefully we will see another new game with some more incredible new features in 2016!The only thing that slightly holds this game back is the lack of customisation that you can put into the cars you pick up at auction. I would love to be able to fit my 20 year old rusty hatchback with a 5.0 litre V8, upgrade to a twin exhaust (or even quad!?), a wide body kit, slam the suspension, tint the windows, even possibly convert it to 4WD! Oh, the possibilities... Perhaps I'm just expecting too much, or maybe I've just been playing too much Need for Speed... Who knows, either way, I would bet money that we will see improvements like these in either future DLC or the next release.Verdict - As much as I really want to give this game a perfect score, it has to be 9/10 based on the lack of customisation for your auction bangers. Still a fantastic game that I will play until my eyes bleed.			",91,8,5,10,4,0,1

												Fun game, it teaches you the basics in car mecanics without having a ""proper"" tutorial. Being such a visual game you get to understand different engine types, transmissions, suspensions, drawbacks and advantages to these and how they can affect the design of each car.There is no end objective but after about 25-30 hours you'll have all the upgrades , 10 more hours and you should have all the parking spots and finally another 10 to fill them up with the cars of your dreams... so if you end up buying this game at a steam sale with all the dlc at about 25 euros for 50 hours of fun+learning something that'll be a bargain.edited: sports =/= spots			",91,15,3,7,9,2,17

												The game gives sweet old feel of Street Rod series. The level of detalisation is enough to get you tired of repairs.Pros:- lots of parts;- there are at least three generations of car design in the game, each with own features;- there is some good music;- it's not complicated and plays easy.Cons:- some processes are not very intuitive, e.g. engine swaps (it works onoly with Performance DLC although there are parts for engine tuning in the core game, and there isn't any explanation or warning about that);- it has some skillpoint grind to do for upgrading the garage;- instruments on the dashboard are just textures;- driving physics is simplified, it doesn't give a real feel of the vehicle.

												This is a great step forward for the game compared to CMS2014. Massive improvements to graphics, tons more vehicle parts to work with, and a whole new approach to issuing missions makes this a major overhaul to what was already a pretty good game. Despite some worries about hardware, I've been running the game at 2560 x 1600 with maxed out settings and see a solid 60fps.The idea of having jobs issued by telephone, with the ability to pick and choose your workload, really works well for me. My son and I picked out a couple of interesting looking jobs, loaded them up on the lifts and started plugging away at the pile of problems. The whole process felt very smooth and intuitive. A nicely structured tutorial at the start (very simple, just a few text popups and some easy initial missions) helped greatly.It's still not as easy as I'd like to navigate around the inside of the vehicle, but since the real thing is even harder I can't complain.These guys have put out a great game, and they even managed to do it on-schedule. If they hit their published targets for DLC I'll be even more impressed.Right now their software is massively underpriced in the Steam store, there is no way this game should be priced so low, so jump onto it asap.

												Firstly let me just say that I have been wrenching on actual cars, motorcycles and marine engines for many years and I truly enjoy it. I also have really enjoyed mechanic simulators in the past, Street Rod was a staple of my childhood.Secondly, If you're *really* into car mechanic simulation, buy this, when its on sale. This is better than Car Mechanic Simulator 2014, but still not a great game. If I had to use one word to describe this game, it would be Tedious. It takes a very, very long time to unlock the more enjoyable parts of the game (9000xp for the garage, are you kidding me??) You'll find yourself repeating the same monotonous, mind numbing jobs to build your xp before you can unlock things like the ""test track"" and the Garage, where you can store your own cars bought at auction. Speaking of which, the XP system leaves much to be desired and appears to have been thought up in 5 seconds with no play testing whatsoever. Remove a part? +1 XP. Install a part? +1 XP. Finish a job? 100XP. That's pretty much it. I guess you could get 9000XP by removing and installing the same spark plug 4500 times. Replacing a piston should generate orders of magnitude more xp than replacing an oil filter. You select the job you wish to take by clicking on your desk phone. It lists 4 jobs, 2 of which always require vastly more XP than you have. The interface can be painful to operate - Press I to open inventory.. but press Escape to close it? How about the parts catalog, which is listed in alphabetical order and does not have nearly enough subcategories. An alphabetical list for engine parts with photos is ridiculous. The repair bench is a button press. That's it. Remove part, attempt to repair, you'll either make it better or make it worse. Boring mechanic. There are definitely lots of parts in the engines, which is great, but the selection of which parts are 'wrenchable' and which are not seems completely arbitrary. Why are there 4 clips holding the airbox together, and like 4 bolts to the entire gearbox? Also please don't force the player to lift and drop the car a bunch of times to work on the engine... some parts are removable from the top, some from the bottom. Why can't I just remove the engine and put it on a test stand?I realize this review is a bit discombobulated, but then again so is this game. It just seems like a lot of values were randomly selected, and not much thought was put into vital gameplay mechanics and interface design. 5/10.Better games in this genre from years past:* Street Rod 1 / 2* Redline Legal Street Racing * Gearhead Garage			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played CMS 14 and enjoyed it. And only having a brief play on CMS 15 there's a lot of improvements that have been made. I maintain this is a great tool for those who want to get to know parts and the very basic mechanical knowledge on a car.Having been a grease monkey I know working on motors is just not that easy. (if only!) There is a steep learning curve, heck, my first job was an engine block replacement! Which meant everything had top be undone, gearbox out, clutch & flywheel out, both manifolds. All fun. Mind you, I have yet to experience pistons and con rods that don't need unbolting from their bottom bearing caps before removing. . (little oversight by the devs there! - but nothing major)I love the way you can take multiple jobs, but that could lead to confusion if you don't check the job sheet. I also like the fact that as jobs go on, you have to check & diagnose the faults yourself. Something to look forward to and be a little challenge. This game, I feel, will just eat away hours, and it's intended not to be stressful, but really a chill out game, like ETS2 or similar.All in told, if you like the idea of messing about with cars but don't want to get your hands oily, then this is ideal.

												This is really fun, a massive step forward from the previous game. I'd really recommend it to anyone who had gotten the older version of this game, and anyone else who is interested in a semi-realistic mechanic simulator like game. You can repair other peoples cars, you can go out and buy your own car and fix it up and then sell it, and the DLC (disclaimer: I don't know how many will be) is Free! How could anyone complain about that? Would i recommend it? Yes! Would i play it for days on end? Definitely.Does it have a lot of replayability? Not really, its very repetitive, but then again - so is the job itself in the real world, so i'd have to say that's just another level of realism. Lol.			",165,16,12,14,48,4,22

It's not the most realistic game, as a lot of parts are repeated through car models, but nevertheless, you can still learn a lot.This game also had DLC, which is pretty good, but it's not free DLC, and in my book, that's a bit rude.

												I'm going to start off with that this isn't the best game in the world, nor should you ever expect it to be. That's not what this is about. However, my friend and I found that we absolutely could not stop playing this game for hours at a time. It may seem like it could get very repetitive but, giving both my friend and I are are car fanatics, it just seems like we could have enough hours under our belt by the time we get bored of the game, if that ever happens. It's your chance to build a shop at your own pace so you can customize your cars. Also, it's worth getting the gold edition, the DLC cars are great!			",268,90,10,28,35,1,37

												Far above and beyond CMS 2014.Still lacking a little in some areas but is constantly being improved by the Dev's.I could go into detail but I think plenty of other reviews have done a good job of that already.The game reminds me sort of like being a puzzle game in a sense.You're given a problem, such as 'there is a rattling noise in the engine;'And must find out the cause and remedy it.Which usually entails replacing a defective part, in my case with the rattling, it was the clutch bearing.The game starts off easing you in, allowing you to know which parts are needing replacement/repair and givingyou the option to highlight them as well.Later on however you won't know which parts are wrong but are giving hints. (""Steering is wobbly"")And you can put the car through various tests which can help you discover what's wrong.Drive the car on the Test Course and you might find out the suspension is bad.Use the OBD Scanner on the car and find out about any electrical problems.Etc.Later you can get into auctions and re-selling cars and stuff; but I won't go into detail there.(mostly cause I haven't reached that far myself yet lol)The bottom line, if you liked 2014, or somewhat liked it, get this game it's so much better.If you like the idea of mechanics but are on the fence.. I would recommend the game still however if youwant to be certain maybe watch some LP's on Youtube or something.			",286,74,16,81,180,10,169

												I watched a gameplay video on Youtube for this game and it grabbed my attention instantly. I am a forty something nerd and geek and I enjoy anything to do with mechanics and technology and this simulator looked like the perfect thing for me, to the point that I even updated my desktop pc to handle the graphics.The game has not dissapointed, I am hooked. I haven't modded the game to increase my XP or money, I have worked through all the telephone jobs I needed so I could unlock everything and start my own car collection. Playing the game this way has shown a great balance of having to earn the money in order to collect the cars from the auction house and renovate them just as you would in real life.The future potential for this game is exciting, hopefully with a few more DLC licenced cars and maybe other vehicles, a track or two to drive around or being able to upgrade your vehicles with a full engine swap and tune, drive conversion, suspension upgrades, also adding bucket seats and a roll cage to create a perfect race or drift car.If a new kickstarter campaign was initiated for these additions I would certainly invest.......

												the improvement from this game from the last game is quite honestly astounding, in the last game you could pretty much just do the basic stuff, this game you can quite literally strip the car down till it is just the body shell and rebuild it from the ground upthough if you buy a game for the ""story"" you wont get much here But this does indeed feel like a sequel to the last game first game you could only work on one car at a time, while this game you start the game and immediately have the ability to work on 3 cars at once using 2 car lifts, and juggle the cars around so you can have it on the lift if you need to replace running gear or have it on the floor when replacing or repairing the body panelsthe game at the moment is very stable and in my 30+hours playing at the point of this review i have not had it crash on me yetthough that being said the bar for entry is pretty high it is recommended that you have at least a basic idea of where the parts are as there is no real tutorial that for instance shows you where the wheel hubs goand once you get to the later part in the game when you can go to auctions and buy and repair cars then resell them is the time you really appreciate the amount of parts that are needed... especially if you plan on restoring a vintage V8 (there are two versions, one with overhead cams, and one with overhead valves) where you need to buy 16 push rods and 16 rocker arms all makes a pretty big dent into your bank accountalso in this game there is the customisation options, that you can ""purchase"" when you have got enough experience (you get experience for everything thing you remove and put back) and this can unlock diagnostics tools in addition to the OBD scanner of the last game, but also a multimeter and a compression tester, or ""efficiencies"" like the faster unbolting, faster removal or faster manual checking or options to customise your shop, also repairing makes a return, but unlike the last game repairing doesn't cost anything but it does have a percentage of success (you start at 40% chance and can upgrade it to a max of 90% chance) and you can if your lucky repair it to like new condition but run the risk of completely failing and ruining the part making it irreparablethen you look at the game and see with the amount of detail that they put into this game, the improvements to gameplay and a game that takes up just over 2GB  on the disk (probably be more when the DLC is released) well you wonder why some other games can't make this level of improvement as well, when you think about that 2014 was released the beginning of last year plus 3 DLC's for the game this game probably tool them 6 months to make, which like I said at the start is astounding ",136,24,11,14,33,2,21

												CMS 2015 is a fun game! It sports better graphics, a slicker interface, improved controls, a deeper career mode, and a better gameplay experience over 2014. In order to unlock additional content (i.e. slicker vehicles, shop improvements, and abilities) you'll have to turn the wrenches a lot longer in order to gain XP. This isn’t entirely a bad thing, as I feel it keeps you coming back for more. The jobs seem to be more varied in both, substance and tasks in order to get you through. However, you’ll see a lot of the same types of vehicles, early on, just in different colors. Despite that, I honestly can’t find much more to complain about. I think the devs did a pretty good job with this outing, and I look forward to seeing what they’ll add to it.			",205,127,4,49,101,0,43

												If you're a person who loves spending time fixing ♥♥♥♥ that has a million pieces and slowly learning the easiest way to said ♥♥♥♥ with each job through experience, then buy this ♥♥♥♥ right now. Easily among the best games I've ever played. Hard grind, decent sense of pacing as well as the ability to set your own goals instead of a clearly defined ""end game."" Great ♥♥♥♥, although the DLC pricing and whatnot is a bit weird, so I suggest getting the Gold edition for a better experience at a cheaper price. Normally I wouldn't suggest paying for DLC but I feel as if the devs deserve it this time around.One more thing: the game is perfect for people who don't know ♥♥♥♥ about cars such as myself, but I couldn't suggest it for people who don't find repairing ♥♥♥♥ and learning about a machine enjoyable. This is a certain type of game for a certain type of people. But if you have any sort of interest when it comes to anything involving cars, then I fully suggest getting this game.Easy 9/10, only thing that would put it over the top is simply adding more content. There's a ♥♥♥♥ton of places you can take this concept and I feel as if the devs adding as much as humanly possible would in the end make it a perfect game, and I don't think I could say that about any other game.

												I find it hypnotic and keep coming back for more.  Very well done.- Many car types included, especially if you purchase the (low cost) DLC- Paced as fast or slow as you want, never rushed- I prefer this to most sims; having no trace of tedium/grind found in most other sims- It's mostly a puzzle game for mechanical engineers.  Although even as a newbie to cars, the game helps you a lot, and in the meantime you'll learn a lot about how cars work- There is test driving of vehicles but no ""racing"" or multiplayer- The most fun is purchasing vehicles at auctions (fixer-uppers) and restoring them for profitable resale.  Take the extra used parts you gathered from these vehicles and repair customer old beaters for almost no cost to you (also very profitable)There is some degree of financial management / budgeting aspect in the game but it's minor.  Given the pacing and profitability of jobs coming in, I have never needed any financial help, and only noticed after playing for 80+ hours that there is a bank loan function!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a very enjoyable and well made game.  Fix cars for customers to earn money, customize your shop and improve your skills (tools), and eventually buy junkers at auction to restore and sell or keep.  It is great fun and no interest or knowledge of mechanics is required.			",142,36,15,30,57,0,40

												Very addictive game. Although it doesn´t have IRL problems, like tightly rusted bolts/nuts, no need for tool change, no diffrent motor oil types... But after busy day at work ( yes, i´m mechanic), you just sit and click parts, stuff, etc. and no dirty hands.			",170,18,7,8,5,0,9

												TL;DR: All in all, a very enjoyable game for anyone, but especially for petrolheads. :-)I would recommend this game to any petrolhead/car fanatic out there. This is a very refreshing game, since it's the only one of it's kind that I know and it's very casual. For me, it's also a nice way to learn a bit more about the anatomy of cars  on top of the knowledge that I already have (and the fact that the game is translated to my native language also helps a lot, since I'm not too familiar with the English names for various parts). That's probably the downside, you'll need some basic car mechanics knowledge to get going. The tutorial isn't really all that explanatory, so if you're not familiar with the basics, it could take you quite some time to figure out what parts you actually need to replace and that can be frustrating.But, if you have some basic knowledge you should be fine. You can pretty much pull apart anything until there's just a skeleton standing. That's what makes the game so cool, there are no limits in what you can and cannot do. There are no set time limits for repairs, so if you feel like completely disecting a car, go ahead and do it!The XP points system keeps the game challenging. You need to unlock certain features to make your life as a mechanic easier like an OBD scanner to read the on board computer for any errors or better tools to be able to take out screws more quickly. The more XP you get, the more challenging jobs you can accept. And with more XP also come sweeter cars, since when you've built up a name for yourself, people with luxury cars also start finding their way to your garage.			",65,15,3,7,11,1,9

												read reviews first thinking it was worse than gearhead garage and the people don't know what the hell they talk about. It's better and could use refining like more parts but I will wait and see the next cm17. Get game if you like gearhead garage and grind and work your way up to 9000xp I am still working and look at how many hours I got into game. Devs do need to keep fanbase and I would love to see cm17 and play it before it comes out!!!

												Have to say that Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is one of the few simulator games that actually does a good job, the graphics are great and runs smoothly even on high settings, have not encountered any bugs yet and is great fun to play.Pros:- Not encountered any bugs.- Active Developers.- Can customize Garage.- Can manage your own garage.- Great new test driving track.- Nice models and textures.- Nice background music while you tinker away with your cars.Cons:- Missing some key components from the cars such as fuel lines, brake lines, water hoses.- Small UI upgrade would be nice, selling/buying multiple parts can get a bit tedious.- Career mode could do with a couple more features such as business decisions, ranking and economy).Suggestions:- Could do with more cars, vans, pickups etc (Bikes?).- A bit more detail under the hood would be great wire, cables etc.- A bigger variety of engine types would be a huge bonus (petrol, diesel, hybrid).- The ability to upgrade your garage, as in starting from scratch and buying bigger property and equipment.- Being able to buy and add fuel lines, brake cables and water hoses to vehicles.- More customization options for vehicles such as:	- Size of alloy wheel	- Tyre sizes	- Full range of aftermarket exhaust systems/backboxes (varying shapes and sizes)	- Aftermarket air filters/ Induction kits.	- The ability to add turbo chargers and superchargers to cars.	- Adjustable ride height on suspension.	- Different paint types (metallic, matt, pastel, pearlescent).	- The ability to have engine parts chromed.	 - and finally different body styling modifications:		- Spoilers.		- Sideskirts.		- Hoods (carbon fibre, scoops, transparent etc)		- Window Tints.		- LED Lights.		- Variety of wing mirrors.		- Vented front fenders.- A couple of extra test tracks would be great also.Just some suggestions as food for thought though what you guys decide to do is obviously your choice along.

												Good step up from 2014, some nice featers like 2 car lifts, better test track and an auction house where you can bid on cars you restore, even has a parking garage for I think 12 cars, I have six waiting to restore then sell on.  The missions are better, seems to make you work more.  Overall good fun.The only down side is the cars, well lack of cars.  There are 14 and they are not great, never even heard of them until now, think they all polish.  Guess Ford, Nissan and the rest did not want us gamers mucking around with there cars.  Also it seems to many items fit all rhe cars like only a single type of park plug, brake pad, brake calipar, clutch parts, even the drive axle is the same for all rear wheel drive cars.Another little bug bear of mine is hardly any cables or tubes, a few but even large tubes that would join the air filter to carbs are missing, this lets things like the air box, battery seem they are just floating in mid air being not joined to anything.  Was hoping this version of the game would have had more detail at all levels.  Its just odd that clips hold the air filter box on yet the exhaust parts just plop on and off with a mouse click, nothing to unbolt.  Just seems things have been left out as they did not have time to do them and you can see this with some items, as an example, there are three types of oil filters then on the other hand only one type of fuel filter and only one type of battery, the list goes on.Overall I am happy with this version for the cost, I just hope they spend less time in the pub and more time rendering 3d models to add to this game, even if they just changed the colour of similar items (they did with the oil filters) to make it seem there is a lot more to choose from would go a long way.

												I liked the first car mechanic simulator (2014) but mostly gave up on it pretty early due to not being comfortable with both the interface and how the camera worked in-game. I'm happy to say this years version is just so much better. I've been playing for hours now (ignore the low hours played stat - Steam was down earlier so I played in offline mode) and it's a very entertaining game. Improvements such as the multiple bays, car auctions, upgrade paths - among many others - just make it a more complete game and I am very happy that I backed it on Kickstarter from the start.I'm only around 15 jobs in and the difficulty has been going up steadily in terms of type of repairs that I'm now being tasked with but - and this is a big but (ahem) - you're left to play the game at your own pace which is perfectly suited for this type of game. I'm having a blast playing this and can't wait to see the later parts of the game once I unlock them.For the price of £14.99 this game is a steal if you have any kind of interest at all in the basic workings of motor vehicles but I wouldn't expect to become a fully-fledged mechanic after putting a few hours into this. Although, having said that,  it's very likely your basic car knowledge of what parts go where will improve dramatically. I used to work in the automotive industry but in the administration side so this game appealed to me for that reason as well.As a comparison the nearest thing I can compare CM2015 to is the ancient Gearhead Garage that Snap-on bought out many, many years ago that was a fun, albeit simple, game repairing and doing up cars to flip at auction and make money. I'm hoping this game further in will vastly improve on that little gem from way back.Highly recommended. Well done to the developers.			",335,76,35,33,56,7,55

			What was the owner doing?!? An interesting job replacing 2 pistons and a turbocharger! Steam Store Link for Car Mechanic Simulator 2015: http://store.steampowered.com/app/320300/		

Farming Simulator, Bus Simulator, Construction Simulator, Grass Simulator, Goat SimulatorThere has been a lot of crappy simulator titles filling the steam store page over the last couple of years, but I was quite surprised last year with coming across Car Mechanic Simulator 2014.The Development Team at Play Way and Red Dot Games were really interested in a lot of the community feedback on the forums and wanted to implement a lot of their ideas by working on either DLC or an update to the game for the fansDue to funding requirements, they reached out to the community on kickstarter, where they did finally get funding to complete Car Mechanic Simulator 2015I was one of those backers and am very happy with how it has turned out!The production value is definately a large increase on the previous 2014 title witha lot of polish put into the game.Each car part is lovingly crafted with a beautiful attention to detail.Even without switching into the Part Examine Mode, you can tell which parts are severely warn by the amount of wear or rust tarnish on the part.In examine mode, most parts can be visually inspected without requiring the advanced tools needed, but in the case of Electrical Parts, you will need to purchase the diagnostic tool to be able to check or repair the parts.Later on in the game, you can also purchase a paint bake house and perform panel work as well as a testing line to assist in finding where that annoying little rattle is coming from.It starts you off in your Garage with the phone ringing to inform that a new job is available Selecting the phone gives you a list of availalble jobs, being able to accept or decline as you see fit.So Grab your Imperial Shifter Spanners, Left Handed Screwdrivers and attach your silencer to your rattle gun! It's time to get busy!Most of the initial starting jobs are simple tasks with parts lists or problem information attached. Like replacing filters, brake pads, Suspension Bushes, wheels and oil. Moving up to the more advanced areas like replacing Turbochargers, Pistons, Muffler Bearings, Crankshafts, Bottles of Boost and Timing Gear.The workshop is fitted with 2 Hoists and a central area, giving you the room to work on a couple of cars at the same time. This also allows access to other areas of the car as there is only so much you are able to do from the top of the engine bay.Repairing Cars are the main focus of making money, but you can also sell the old parts that were replaced for a little extra money. Once progressed far enough in the game, you have the ability to go to market and buy cars for your own overhauls and sell them at auction. A fantastic distraction on the side of increasingly difficult fault finding and part replacement.If you have ever been interested in cars, mechanics or even wonder how they all fit together this is a fantastic sim to get you into and learning all about the ins and outs of engines and suspension.And Maybe, Just Maybe, you might also realise that a few parts I mentioned don't really exist.

												It's fun for the first hours, then it gets very repetitive and there is no challenge here, besides finding the rusted parts and replacing by shiny ones. Your money has no purpose, you almost can't assemble the parts out of order by mistake (at least on normal difficulty), if you know how to fix one car, you know how to fix them all, you can't expand your business nor your garage AFAIK...Oh, so much potential. Such a disappointment. It gets pretty boring after sometime. It's a puzzle game with cars, but very limited and all looks more of the same. I'm glad I got this in a cheap bundle.

												Owned the game since it was first released and also downloaded every DLC (barring Benz) since it was put up. As an auto mechanic, there's obviously a number of things with this game that aren't accurate when it comes to the trade.But when I get home, I usually want to crack a beer and spend a few hours mindless restoring cars (and since the new performance DLC, make them fast).If you're not very automotive inclined, then this is definitely a good starting point for learning where things are in relation to the rest of the vehicle. I enjoy it, recommended with the performance and tuner DLC. I would highly recommend picking up the game and all of it's DLC when on sale.			",79,9,3,15,27,0,10

Wish I could re-bind keys.  Also, the camera angles while in (dis)assemble mode are a bit rough to get used to.

												As an automotive engineer, I wanted to expand my knowledge to knowing how to repair all parts of a car. While Car Mechanic Simulator is a nice tool for learning part locations, that's kind of where it stops. There's really nothing more than just replacing rusty parts with new parts. 90% of the game is screwing and unscrewing. Nonetheless a nice relaxing game that's good for remembering part names and locations and seeing in a nice 3D world how parts all fit together.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good but a bit repetitive - Another relaxing game if you like to have something else to do while you watch TV or listen to the radio/podcasts in the background. Essentially, you're given a few different 3D jigsaw puzzles which have to take apart, find out which parts are broken (which appear corroded for some reason), replace/repair said parts, and put them back together again (the game shows you where they go). Optionally, you can perform diagnostic tests on vehicles to make finding broken parts easier, rather than find out for yourself by removing them from vehicles - But I think that also takes away the tiny ammount of challenge that this game has to offer.It also has XP and Levels to lengthen the content. Earn XP by completing repair jobs on vehicles, and unlock different cars, perks (more diagonstic tools, faster unbolting) and more complex jobs.There's not a lot to this game and it doesn't demand much of your attention once you've learned the basics, although it's nicely animated and does a good job at showing the very basics of car anatomy. You probably won't learn more than that from playing it, though. It's not an educational tool, if you're expecting it to be one.			",81,12,1,7,14,0,6

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is a great game. The game isn't super realistic but it is definitely fun. You learn to read the problem list and the parts required to fix them. There is a little bit of depth and after a few hours you will be able to take the entire car apart and put it back together without too much trouble. The real fun beings when you start to find the most efficient method of repairing a car and taking the extra steps to tune them early on in the game. I bought the base game and soon all of the DLCs. Totally worth it. They bring great variety to the game and getting the DeLorean was totally worth every penny when I finally got to work on one.Anyway, if you like a straight forward sim with a variety of parts and cars this is the best one out there as far as I can tell IMO. 4/5 Wrenches. :P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is way more fun than it deserves to be. That is a good thing.Will you learn how to repair a real car? No. But it will give you a rough approximation of where certain parts are located in a car and a general idea of what they could look like. It's essentially a puzzle game. You are told the car has a noise in the engine, you need to find and repair the specific part. As you play you gain access to more testing tools so you can check the current durability of items without needing to fully disassemble the vehicle. But let's face it, eventually you will fully disassemble a vehicle for the fun of it, because you can.			",152,84,6,23,35,4,33

Like alternators, starters, transmissions, etc  etc. Also rework Interiors like upholstery, dashboards or maybe even add accessories like turbochargers lift kits			",139,26,1,54,16,3,22

												This is a Great game but when are we going to see more car customization options (e.g enigne swaps, superchargers, two-tone paint jobs, wraps, Decals, lift kits, or lowering your vechile).  I'd also like to see some light trucks in the game like maybe a Ford Ranger, Dodge Dakota, or Chevy S10 something along those lines.  Other than everything I just listed this is a great game doesn't matter if your a real mechanic (like me) or someone thats never been under the hood this game is a solid 6 out of 10 if they'd update the game and add everything I just mentioned it be and easy 10 out of 10.

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is a great game. The game isn't super realistic but it is definitely fun. You learn to read the problem list and the parts required to fix them. There is a little bit of depth and after a few hours you will be able to take the entire car apart and put it back together without too much trouble. The real fun beings when you start to find the most efficient method of repairing a car and taking the extra steps to tune them early on in the game. I bought the base game and soon all of the DLCs. Totally worth it. They bring great variety to the game and getting the DeLorean was totally worth every penny when I finally got to work on one.Anyway, if you like a straight forward sim with a variety of parts and cars this is the best one out there as far as I can tell IMO. 4/5 Wrenches. :P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is way more fun than it deserves to be. That is a good thing.Will you learn how to repair a real car? No. But it will give you a rough approximation of where certain parts are located in a car and a general idea of what they could look like. It's essentially a puzzle game. You are told the car has a noise in the engine, you need to find and repair the specific part. As you play you gain access to more testing tools so you can check the current durability of items without needing to fully disassemble the vehicle. But let's face it, eventually you will fully disassemble a vehicle for the fun of it, because you can.			",152,84,6,23,35,4,33

												This is a huge improvement over Car Mechanic Simulator 2014.  I've owned it for only one week and have 32 hours on the game already (work full time, long commute, activities on the weekends).If you like to take things apart and build things, or like cars in general, you should check this game out.  It's not so true to life that you would be able to do major work on your own car with only this game as education, but you would learn which parts are which and generally where to find them.There are many other reviews that do this game more justice than mine, but I wanted to record my ""yes"" vote anyway.

Product received for free
Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 ReviewCar Mechanic Simulator 2015 gives those unfamiliar with cars to familiarise themselves with the subject, but quickly runs out of fun.GameplayCar Mechanic Simulator is an immersive experience for the player, taking in account many important details to fixing cars.  Going into this game, I was expecting to be able to fix some sports cars or exotic vehicles, perhaps tuned ones.  Unfortunately, the game has a major issue with pacing.  I've fixed several cars already and still I've been limited to not only fictional, but very mundane and ""nomal, uninteresting"" cars.  I do have the maserati DLC but it took forever to unlock and from what I know, the Masterati's are the only true-to-life brand available to the player.  Despite my complaints towards the game's pacing, I have great respect for the amount of content and detail that the developer has been able to jam into this little game.  The player is able to take each vehicle out for a test drive, before and after mending them.  Each problematic or faulty component is conveniently highlighted in red and are usually very easy to spot.  Although CMS'15 lacks a rich tutorial, it makes up for it as the game is easy to pick up but difficult to master.  The goal of the player is not to simply complete each contract, but also to master the game and learn the car's components and their connection to performance.All in all, though CMS'15 isn't too much fun, it's definitely a rich learning experience and as a motorhead, I enjoyed learning more about the design of cars through the use of a car mechanic simulator.Pros+Immersive+Extraordinary detail+Enjoyable and forgiving learning curve+Very educational+Great visualsCons-Incredibly slow pacing-Fictional vehicles (understandable)-Tedious at timesRating: 7/10This review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games.

												There's something like mindfulness about taking apart a piece of engineering and putting it back together.A full-bodied simulator true to the name, very engaging. In some orders you don't get a list of what needs fixing and you need to run diagnostics, test drive the car, or just take it apart and look, to find what you need to replace.Recommended to anyone who's mechanically inclined, and even if you're not, you will probably find enjoyment in its presentation and gameplay.

												Learn something and have fun at the same timeNot really as detailed as the real thing, but it will give you a general idea what it means to be a mechanic and how various basic things in and around the car work and what they names are and later you will learn from this game how to make basic diagnostic, these things can be useful now or in the future for you if you have no clue about cars and parts.Very well made learning game and its fun, as a former car mechanic I really enjoy this game and can only recommend it, its very relaxingI wish the game would go into more detail, but that would be very complicated for many peopleI have all DLCs and even tho most are not really worth the full price, but thanks to the support from players the game is improving and adding new features			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For the asking price, the game has quite a bit to offer. Also once modding is in place, it will be even more worth it as you'll be able to just download new cars for your shop. It's a bit slow paced at first, but once you get your upgrades it's not too bad. If you ever played a game called ""Gearhead Garage"" and you're hoping this is something like it, it's that and then some.I also contacted the developer on twitter and they stated they're interested in adding more tracks to the game for driving your cars on, as well as race modes like drag racing through DLC. If they keep to that promise, this game will have no issues selling tons of copies.Hopefully for 2016 they bring in co-op and even more content, considering you can't really work on 3 cars at once, it would help a lot.

												After playing Gearhead Garage for years and years (the mods really added to the replay value) this game came up on my radar. Of course I was sold at the very moment I saw it. When I got it and played it for a couple of hours I already noticed that I missed certain thing in comparison with Gearhead. After giving it more time, it quickly lost it's ""magic"". With Gearhead released so many years earlier and it being an example where the developers could (and should) have looked at, Car mechanic Simulator comes over as a watered-down version (in every aspect) of gearhead. All the DLC is not helping.I often find myself booting up gearhead garage where it should/could have been Car Mechanic Simulator; this says enough in my opinion.Don't get me wrong: it was fun for a bit, but it just didn't last.I'd like to rate it neutral instead of positive or negative, but when I have to choose, I'm afraid I'll have to rate it a thumbs down.

												This game DOES go on sale quite a bit, so definitely pick up while that's going on if you're thinking about getting it. For under $10, it's a decent buy. I definitely would not buy for $20 though. At the same time that this game improves upon a lot of the downfalls of CMS 2014, it still lacks a way to stop the mind-numbing process involved in getting to the good content of the game.  After playing for two hours, I'm still grinding through basic jobs in hopes of eventually getting to actually work on my own cars.I'd say the music has improved but still is an extremely repetitive playlist. They can't be more than 20 minutes long, if not less. **UPDATE** One new song was added since I wrote this. Probably a 25 minute playlist now. You're better off muting the game music and playing your own.If you haven't played CMS 2014, then it will be more likely that you enjoy this game since you won't notice how little it has really changed. It has definitely gotten better since then, but I think that maybe some more time developing should have been used.Basically, I really think that this game still needs work; but it looks like the developers are really looking for support from the community to do so gradually. That's fine. While it definitely is a finished product, some aspects of it just look very cheap. Don't get me wrong, I think this is a very good game. Not to mention it's pretty much the only mechanic sim out there right now. It's just that I feel like it still falls short of being a great game. It's almost feels like I bought an early access game without the label on it.I don't want to say this about the game because I know that the developers have worked very hard for this, but I really wouldn't be able to pass off pretending to fix virtual cars as a fun activity to anyone.  You're really better off watching informational videos on YouTube on how to perform the tasks you'd be doing in the game and maybe practicing on a real car than playing this game. Although it may feel like it has some educational value, you don't really need more than basic car knowledge to get these jobs done. Let's be real.I really don't agree with how little experience points you get from jobs that require you to diagnose several different systems and repair them. To even be able to access all of the new features of the game, you need to get a parking garage which costs 9000 XP. Over 20 jobs later, I'm only at 4000 XP. At least there's a bigger variety of problems to fix, unlike CMS 2014, but it's still just wayyyy too much. Why isn't the garage paid with money instead of experience anyway?All this aside, the game gets good support and still has updates and DLC coming, so there's hope all of this gets fixed eventually.

												Performs far better on my HD-4000 based machine than did the 2014 release and looks far better to boot. Not many games you can say that about. Only minor complaints... * The auction portion can be a bit tedious. Would go better if the 'Next Car' button were not grayed out until the current car rolls up.* The RNG-based parts repair is a bit cheesy. The chances of success should scale up a bit more based on XP, perhaps.All in all, it's an excellent game.			",116,15,3,9,32,0,3

												This game is super cool. First auto simulator for me. I own a broken down cool car of yesteryear. I have done some work on it and found it to be very satisfying. To get more into cars and increase my knowhow, I have been watching Youtube car repair channels. In one of the channels, the presenter mentioned this game so I gave it a shot. This game is awesome! Granted I like cars to start with, but I think that anyone with even slight mechanical inclinations would enjoy this game. Pros: figure out where all the parts are; learn how to do a brake job; learn spark plug replacement; get to see how different cars are built (worked on I4 SOHC, I4 DOHC, and then a two cylinder air-cooled rear engined buggy clone) attractive graphics; realistic without getting your hands dirty; good gameplay. Cons: music tracks are good but are few in number; only two hours in but I haven't yet dealt with electrical items; may get repetitive if you do not like cars. I am two hours into this game and I love it. Worth every last cent of the twenty buck price.			",35,1,1,3,2,0,2

												This is a great game for those who are interested in cars (or just like to tinker with systems.) But let me state (and mind you I'm not a mechanic or a gearhead by any stretch of the imagination) that this game presents a simplistic and reductionist version of a car. If you don't know jack about cars you might walk away thinking you know how to fix a car. ""It could be the tie rods connecting the front left steering knuckle"" you'll say to your girlfriend as you look at her car when in reality your guess is just as good as anyother layman. Now the mechanics (ahem) aside, the car restoration bit is what keeps me in it. That sort of ""Now what have we got here?"" feeling you get when a new old beater comes into your ship. It's sort of exciting to be a kind of mechanical detective finding and fixing problems on an old car. And if you're unscrupulous, you can take older parts you have lying around and switch them for newer parts on a car sent into your shop for repair. Outfitted a whole Rino Piccolo with parts I looted from cars sent in for repair.Overall 10/10   Would definitely loot cars for their sweet, sweet gearbox components again.			",118,16,4,19,60,2,38

Replay value is a bit low, which is why I wish that they would open it up to community mods (cars, parts etc).

												My final in auto in high school was rebuilding an engine. I got saddled with a guy that wanted to do all of the work himself so we would get an A in the class. I watched. Without much interest. He did everything, I got an A in that class. And learned absolutely nothing. I have always wanted even an iota of auto knowledge. This looks promising. I performed two filter replacements. Something I actually know how to do in real life - woo! And now I am learning how to remove a flywheel - never even knew what that was before tonight. I think I am going to enjoy this game immensely.EDIT - Devs, wow. Great game. Seven hours in and I know I need to check or replace the ABS if the brakes are bad. I know if the car is noisy, I need to look at the exhaust manifold, the muffler, and the catalytic converter. I know absolutely nothing about cars.This game is amazing.			",443,95,9,78,59,7,90

												I have a love-hate relationship with this game.I like taking cars apart and putting them back together. That by itself is quite addictive and has resulted in me spending many hours in this game. The graphics for the most part are also nice, if a bit dated.Unfortunately I dislike pretty much everything else about this game.First off, the tutorial and controls are awful. There are a lot of little details to playing the game that are not communicated to the player, and I had to resort to searching online to find out some very basic information on how to play.Next, once you get past the different exteriors, you'll find that there are only really four types of cars. I4 FWD, I4 RWD, old V8 RWD, and new V8 RWD. The parts are extremely generic and many of them are interchangeable between all of the cars.Buying replacement parts is quite annoying. You have to remember exactly which part you need, and many of the parts have very similar nondescript names (clip a , clip b, timing belt (V8), etc) so it's relatively easy to buy the wrong part and waste money. Until you spend your XP on the tablet upgrade, you have to run back and forth between the car and the desk PC to get parts.Game progression is tedious and annoying. You get 1 XP for taking a part off, putting it back on, or fixing it. This is true whether the part is an air filter clip or a gearbox. Fixing parts is annoying since you have an arbitrary chance to break it. Once a part is broken, regardless of its initial condition, it is now useless junk. Extremely annoying when said part is an expensive engine block in good condition that just needs a little polishing.Every 1000XP you earn an upgrade point. The game provides no guidance on what's actually useful. There are two upgrade categories: time saving tools and useless, disappointing cosmetic upgrades for the shop. Don't waste your points on the appearance upgrades, all they are is a handful of different colors for the indicated item. There are two critical shop upgrades you'll need to progress in the game: the paint shop and the top level of repair tools to repaint cars and fix car bodies respectively. Everything else is just a timesaver.Once you do get to the endgame of buying and restoring cars, you'll have to endure the supremely annoying car auction. This game managed to capture the annoyance of buying cars at an auction where there's always someone bidding you up so you end up paying 2 or 3 times (or more!) the starting bid for a car. After restoring a car, there's really not much you can do with it. You can put it in your garage and look at it, or take it to the underwhelming drag strip. All you can really do at the strip is endlessly race yourself. It doesn't help that the driving mechanics feel like an afterthought and the graphics on the drag strip are significantly worse than the rest of the game.This game has ridiculous loading times even on a fast PC with a SSD. I don't know what the devs did wrong, but it takes over a minute to load the shop and scene changes are equally slow.The DLC is the thing I hate most about this game. It appears that the devs removed some core features from the game to sell later as DLC. If you own all the DLC it would likely address the endgame and variety issues and add some much needed part swapping mechanics, but the fact that it is being sold as DLC and not included in the base game is unforgiveable. The base game is rough and unfinished and needs some TLC, but the devs are more interested in churning out more DLC packs. I get that they need money, but finish the base game first before tacking on DLC.Overall, while the core gameplay is addictive, when you take a step back and look at game as a whole, there's really nothing worthwhile here there other than that core sandbox.

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 isn't an expensive DLC for the previous game. It's a big, standalone product with lots of interesting changes that diversify the gameplay and eliminate the feeling of being shown what to do at specific times. We get many new parts and cars, and a sensible experience system smoothly introduces the player to new things. And even if there's still some boredom here and there, the sequel looks just fine.

												Usually when I see Simulator in the title of game I avoid the game like the plague!  More often than not, the classification of ""Simulator"" is abused and misused by developers hoping to cash in on a weak Genre with very few good games. I am very pleased to say there's actually a game in here! This does not play like an early access game. It feel more like a finished game they keep adding stuff to, and I personally love it. However would I title it a ""Simulator""? That's a bit of a stretch. But overall, it's still a nice game. I have very few complaints about the game, mostly with some of the odd steps you must take to complete a job, like completly removing the exhaust manifold to remove the front exhaust pipe for example or your HAVE to remove the Starter from the top, not the bottom (on some cars). Also the total lack of gaskets in the game is perplexing, this is a simulator - where are the gaskets? But overall I would recommend this game to car lovers, mechanics, and simulator players.

												I have played both of the car mechanic simulators, and I have to say, this one is better in every single way. And you can't ever complete this one, because jobs are unlimited and randomly generated. This game is very addictive, and it feels a lot like euro truck simulator 2 but with fixing cars instead of delivering cargo. This is not one of those crappy simulators you usually see on steam, this is amazing like euro truck simulator 2. Also, you can modify the colors of your workshop, buy attachments like a paint shop, a test area and a parking garage where you can store your car collection. You gain exp from working on cars, and with it, you unlock more cars with more problems to work on, more attachments to buy for your workshop, and you get upgrade points to upgrade your character, and to get tools to help you identify problems with cars. There's a lot more cars in this one than in 2014, and they are much more detailed with much more parts. This time you can work on the cooling system, open up the engine block and replace pistons or the crankshaft and the crankshaft bearings and everything. This game has insane amounts of detail, and the graphics and textures are mind blowing. The reflections are also really nice. The game also runs really smooth, and you don't even need the recommended graphics card if you want to run the game on Ultra graphics settings. I run it on Ultra very smoothly with my GTX 560 TI 2GB Phantom graphics card, so yeah. I honestly have never seen such gorgeous textures and reflections in a game before.  Well, Gta V has nice reflections, but still, this game is gorgeous too. In this game you can not only work on the parts of your car, but also on the panels, like doors, fenders, bumpers, lights, etc. Also, this game has tons of free DLC coming out, and they look like they will be amazing! The game's soundtrack is pretty cool too, even though I'm not really a fan of dubstep, I enjoy the game's dubstep soundtrack. It gets repetitive after a while though, because there's not a lot of songs in the game. I would like it a lot if they add more songs, and perhaps also a custom radio thing where you use your own music for the game's playlist. At the moment when I feel like using my own music, I turn off the game's soundtrack in the options menu, and run my playlist in the background, but I think it would be awesome if they added an in-game feature to use your own music, so you don't have to turn off music in the options each time you want to listen to something else. This game is also well worth the $20, and I highly recommend you buy it!			",413,95,35,35,65,4,32

												If every now and then, you like to get your hands dirty mechanically, but just don't have the opportunity. Then this can work as a quick fix (though not always). Mechanically pretty accurate, though obviously simplified in some aspects. If you don't know anything about cars, this will definitely help you understand suspension and engines a bit better.

												As someone completely devoid of knowledge in mechanics, I can tell you that CMS2015 has taught me a LOT. It isn't as deep as it could be but it still can give you a basic notion if you play it and keep a tab open in your web browser to further study what you see in the game. I even managed to replace my car's air intake and air filter by myself =D .Basically you have to fix your customers' car, stripping down the car until you find what the problem is. You can use a number of tools to ascertain which parts are faulty or you can drive the car down a test track. You will have to purchase or attempt to fix the part by yourself, replace it and build it up again. You can also buy used vehicles and restore it, but it gets kinda pointless since there's nothing to do with it apart from photographing it and selling it. It's very casual and gets repetitive fast but still very fun to play. Recommended  for mechanics wannabes =P			",102,20,2,3,9,0,3

												Excellent game. Frequent updates, great detail. Only thing that is missing is the compressed air pistol for unbolting wheels and other parts.  If you like cars, this is a must buy. Its a LOT better than CMS 2014. Great music too. I also suggest getting the DLCs, they're awesome. Thanks for reading :)			",65,9,13,6,15,0,2

												Well after waiting over a couple of years this Car Sim is just amazing. Nearly same concept like the ancient Gearhead Garage Game. The Gameplay makes lot of fun and its easy get in fast and upgrade your garage until you are able to buy and sell your own cars. The only thing i am missing quite strong is the possibility to upgrade / pimp the engine of course or body parts.As future addons i wish i can have a bigger test circuit or race track  and some more custom options.The amount of different cars is quite okay but can improve over time. The Price for this Game is very  okay as long the addons dont cost extra.			",96,7,8,17,23,0,29

												Its a good game, but there could be some improvements made. Less detail in some areas, oil draining for example, the margin for where the drain pan is small, make that bigger. The way you disassemble and reassemble, you should be able to take off multiple parts at one time. A parts cupboard or something similar would be good to store repaired and used parts rather than have all parts mixed in together. A colour palette for the paint shop rather than a slider for hue etc It takes ages to collect XP. More toolbox upgrades. Timing and carb tune up options. Tyre options. A dyno tuner as well maybe. Trade cars with friends maybe, or race them. Theres so much more that can be done with this game. For now Im giving it 6 out of 10, only because there is so much room for improvment, I hope the creators keep working on this game to make it better.			",51,3,6,1,5,0,0

												Not as good as it should have been. The game is super grindy and has no real end-game. CMS14 had persistant customers and tuning that wasn't behind a paywall. My customers would wreck their cars or come back for additional work. In CMS15 all of the jobs are randomized. None of them make any sense. No one comes in for a set of front brakes, just one caliper, one set of pads, and a rear drum. Broken crankshaft, but everything else in the engine is fine. For some reason oil is simulated (like in CMS14), but coolant and gear oil are (still) not. The grind to unlock the parking lot to start buying auction cars is real, and you can't make real money with the auction cars until you have all 9 ranks of tool upgrades. At that point, the only thing to earn more money for is more spots to park cars that you can't tune or upgrade without shelling out more real $$ money.The models are a lot nicer than in CMS14, but the gameplay has gotten worse, and the DLC Simulator is real. Avoid this one and future titles.			",423,141,6,44,47,3,56

												I'm going to start off with that this isn't the best game in the world, nor should you ever expect it to be. That's not what this is about. However, my friend and I found that we absolutely could not stop playing this game for hours at a time. It may seem like it could get very repetitive but, giving both my friend and I are are car fanatics, it just seems like we could have enough hours under our belt by the time we get bored of the game, if that ever happens. It's your chance to build a shop at your own pace so you can customize your cars. Also, it's worth getting the gold edition, the DLC cars are great!			",65,8,6,1,9,2,4

												I played CMS 2014 alot and had fun but it still felt things were missing.Gearhead garage... Now if only they could bring us back to that feeling,the auction mode,the fun it gave us.Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 has already done just that for me.I have only played for about 2 hours and what took about 5 minutes to fix a engine repair now can take upto 15 minutes becuase of the more realistic detail.I haven't got to the auction section yet because I haven't leveled up enough yet.Yep,you have xp for your mechanic to level up and unlock different tools and perks for your mechanic and it feels very balanced in the way that you have actually earned it.I would gladly pay more than $20 for this game since thre is already 5 dlcs planned and modding ability.This game is a must buy if you liked CMS 2014 or a Gearhead Garage fan,you don't want to miss this game:)			",30,4,1,9,15,0,11

												Honestly the only way I can think to make this game any better is to add realistic sound effects and mechanic actions. I want to hear the painful shattering of knuckles hitting steel by accident and the curses spewing from my tobacco filled mouth out of pure anger and agony. Another thing that I think needs to be added in conjunction with the afore mentioned agony is having the option to throw your tools in anger damaging the vehicle in the process only adding to the pain. Also there should be a frustration meter that runs all the time that rises from things like your wife calling to talk about something you don’t care about at the time, or ever. With these features missing I would have to give this game a, 9 out of 10. Just needs a little touch of true mechanic life.			",460,140,13,62,78,7,86

												Simply put... no, I do not recommend this game.The game itself is not bad. Let's talk about the developers instead.The developers are pretty terrible. The game is lacking in substance, and instead forces the player to be fairly repetitive, and the developers arent... developing the game. The game gets updated maybe every 2 months, but nothing seriously important is ever added. These developers would rather spend these two months pumping out DLC than adding to their own game. Features they have even promised months ago have yet to appear. The game isnt bad, and in the hands of a developer that would rather create a functioning game than DLC riddled trash, it would be a good game. ",45,3,4,11,16,0,2

												Some major points.I can say for certain the core gameplay is pretty decent. Informative for someone like me who only knows a few part names and has made few repairs on their car. There are a number of additions that i feel should defintely be included though. More fluids, electronics repair, part descriptions, better damage indicators rather than generic rust, and just listening to engine sounds to diagnose problems quicker - to name a few. This isnt a simulator, rather a collection of minigames based on the reality of auto mechanics.The progression and experience earning rate is dreadfully slow, though. It does feel like hours before i got to my first 1000 Xp and chose my first measly upgrade. Load times are pretty merciless. I really wish they would focus on smoothing it out rather than other features.Most importantly though; the DLC. Why on Earth would you release a ""Gold""/complete version of this game that collects all of the downloadable content if you're gonna release another new dlc pack after, separately?? That's total lack of respect for your customers. I cant see why they wouldnt include it in an update, at least for those have the Gold version like me.This is an ethics issue that i cant forgive them for. I can praise the simple repair aspect of the game but i wouldnt recommend this on a account of poor professionalism from the developer.			",72,11,1,16,6,1,6

												Would not recommend for the following reasons:- Totally lacking in challenge. You cannot assemble parts in the wrong order, you cannot return an incomplete car to a customer and money was never a constraint.- Very simplistic. Engine components are absent for simplicities sake. Once you've played the game a bit even the most complicated tasks take under 15 minutes. Broken components are identified by their heavy amount of rust (even on brand new vehicles).- After a few hours of gameplay the game becomes very repetitive.- Way too much part crossover. SUV, sports car, sedan all share 80%+ the same parts.I continued to play after I stopped enjoying it as I was hoping that buying cars in auction & restoring them to build a garage would be fun. I turned out to be even more tedious than the early game as EVERYTHING is damaged on every car. Why not just sell the body then if you have to strip everything every time anyways?The best way to fix this game would be to add some proper variety. Working on the ""youngtimer"" DLC that comes with the game shows what good DLC could do. The parts are entirely unique and vehicle assembly is different from every other car.The problem is the cost of DLC, it would be another $35 to add content that needs to already be in this game to recommend. I would suggest waiting until an ""ultimate/complete edition"" packages the game with all DLC for a reasonable price.			",180,67,18,46,37,1,47

And the work on the cars gets more complicated, or prolonged because of the ammount of things you need to repair on the vehicle, whether its body panels or all the way to the inside of the engine block.

												My 14 year old nephew loves anything and everything about cars and I mean everything from Trucks to bus just everything, since he was 5 years old.  So having this game and letting him see whats under the hood and taking care of the orders that come in.  After watching him play this is pretty cool mini game having your own garage to work on cars.  This should be in racing games.  Having parts rust out and need replacement.

												For the oldies among you who remember gearhead garage and buying some piece of... metal.. and then transforming it into a work of art, this is the new better version of that. Yep it has an auction room, garage and a test track (although I dont like the test track at all). You can paint your car any colour you want (doesnt seem to be any decals to apply though). On the whole a great game when you want to take a rusted heap of metal for a couple of thousand and turn it into a great profit. It can be a bit tediuos at first as you can only repair customer veichles. Once you get your parking though and a little capital... oh yeah. Nothing like a 100% castor rex standing in your garage, painted and ready to sell..I like this game very much and hope to see more content added in the future. I would especially like to see a better test track.			",12,3,1,6,6,0,1

Good game for $5This is a good game for if you want to play a game while listening to a podcast, because it doesn't require a very high amount of concentration. I wouldn't want to play it just by itself though, since it can get a bit tedious. For someone like me, who's unfamiliar with the inner workings of cars, the game basically functions as a puzzle game. I recommend getting this game at a discount, since it's not worth its full price, but for $5 it's a nice time-waster of a game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm torn on this one - the game is somewhat addictive - until the repetitiveness starts - after a few dozen hours you have restored every car, know which faulty part causes which problem, have built your 'dream' car out of the available cars, have your repair skills maxed out and so on.I bought this game in a humble bundle with the youngtimer DLC (that ***** Maluch) included and bought the Trader pack and the performance DLC in a steam sale. In my opinion, the DLCs are a huge bad point of the game: some integral parts of the game must to be bought via DLC and even those are somehow incomplete. For example the performance DLC allows engine upgrades, but no suspension and brake upgrades. What's the point of the car upgrades anyway because there's only a dragstrip and nothing else.So you often get the feeling that parts of the game are missing. Another example: what is going on with car interiors? You strip a 1-star-condition car down to the naked shell, yet there's a pristine interior in it in which you can click around on named items, but no function.A last word on the car-brand-DLCs:DON'T! You pay about 6€/$ for a mere two additional cars and nothing else per DLC.Long story short: if you get the gold edition in a steam sale for less than 15€/$ or so, I'd recommend it, otherwise avoid it.

												Came essentially free with a humble bundle of other things I wanted. Was initially interested in the game and the concept as I have an interest in vehicles, but playing it fixed this. I gave it a couple of weeks and came back to it just in case, but this did not help any.Anything remotely interesting (instead of replace this list of random parts that makes no sense) is locked behind a massive grind, paid DLC, or both. The controls are clunky and poorly thought out, my initial assumption was that the keyboard controls were gimped in favour of controller compatability, but it doesn't even register a controller.If you received this with a humble bundle and haven't activated it yet -- don't, it's not worth hitting ctrl-c.If you are considering paying for it, definitely don't.

												Awesome game. It won't teach you to be a mechanic - but you will tinker with the basic components of how a car works.In the game you will have to find and replace damaged parts, and as you become proficient at this you will have to start diagnosing whats broken. You can also try repairing parts to save dough. To make life easier, you will buy a variety of tools to test the car to find what's wrong, to make repairing go faster, etc.This game is a huge jump from the last version - and so if you like car games you should buy this for two reasons: a) it's a good game and b) the developers are really showing their skill and passion for this series; so they really deserve some support.+ decent graphics+ innovative gameplay+ excellent improvement over the last version+ interesting DLCs at fairly reasonable prices- sometimes confusing upgrade system - could use more cars- body work not has comphrehensive as engine and undercarriage systemstl;dr; if you have even a passing interest in cars, repairing them, etc - this is a great game.

The DLC's are decent and not over priced like some I could mention and it seems like they listen to us gamers big thumbs up from me keep up the good work guys :) The graphics are much improved and the game seems to run very smooth when dismantling and assembling parts.Navigating around the menu is easier and the game still has that relaxed feeling to it which is what appeals to me.I have a lot of knowledge about car engines and where i should be looking for parts to change, but don't despair if you don't know a thing because a cool feature when you start is it highlights the parts you need to replace and you get a check list so you know when your done.Iv'e just started so can't comment on the new stuff it has to offer, but i will update at a later stage :)			",309,265,36,24,31,5,32

												I only put about five hours into it, so I'm sure there's plenty of stuff I haven't seen/done yet.First off, this is one of those odd European simulation games. You're a car mechanic. You fix cars.No jetpacks, no fire breathing dragons, no guns.At the start you're dropped into your garage. There's no tutorial. Occasionally when you look at a menu, or try something out there will be a brief tooltip about what that particular feature does. This can hamper your enjoyment. For example I spent a good 15 minutes trying to figure out how to order parts. I should have seen the obvious, that you use your computer to search for, then order parts. Makes perfect sense in retrospect.But, you say, how is the repair portion? You know, the actual meat of the game! At first, everything is deeply confusing. First, you look at the repair order. In the beginning it tells you what parts need to be replaced. You go over, select the proper view mode, and start clicking on parts. In one mode, parts can be inspected. In another mode you can disassemble parts. In another you reassemble. So, basically it goes, find the problem, remove bits until you can remove the problem part, replace and reassemble. Later more difficult jobs appear, that give you a general idea of the problem, and you need to search for the bad parts yourself. Eventually you wind up doing bodywork as well as other repairs. Also there is a point where you can buy, repair and resell cars, but I haven't gotten to that point yet. The layout of parts is somewhat simplified. There isn't any wiring that I've seen so far, and I haven't had an interior job yet. These things may happen later though. As you do more jobs, you gain experience. This allows you to have access to more tools, more in depth jobs, and different kinds of cars to work on.I'd say I'd recommend the game. It's oddly calming and soothing, while at the same time providing an interesting challenge. It does have a demo, so if you're interested, try it out!  ",356,176,10,91,38,4,71

												Great game! It's highly detailed, and its very intuitive too. It's also very educational too, I know some parts of a car, but now I know more about it. Coincidentally, I have a unit about cars, and we will be looking into it in the summer. ",4,0,2,0,0,0,0

												Have to give this one a cautious thumbs up. There aren't enough customization options in the base game, and the game is a bit over-monetized. That said, it still plays pretty well and has a fairly good feel to it. It does have a couple of issues that I'll correct right now... 1. the radio is under the window cill behind the Right Lift. 2. The unlockable diagonistic tools can be activated using F1-F3 when in examine mode when looking at the engine. I didn't discover this until 100+ hours into the game. So except for those usability fails, it's a pretty interesting game... Has an issue with part identification in expert mode tho, ie there's no manual to refer to to figure out which part to put on a car if you sold the old ones too soon. ",14,1,2,1,0,0,0

												Successor of the indie surprise CMS 2014 this game is a diamond in the raw. Insta-buy for fans of 2014.Exactly why it's so addicting to repair stuff I don't know, I never even changed a tire in reality.Repair, get money, upgrade your stuff, repeat -that's it.A meditating game to relax when you don't want brutal action.Oh and don't expect to be able to change your gearbox at home after playing, life doesn't work that way. :)This game is still quiet raw, I'll keep buying it year after year until they make it perfect. Hints for the devs->How about web radio support like in euro truck simulator 2? Also trucks and motorcycles, more music.More ingame joke stuff like in the first game the clients' description of the damage. More test drives.Game crashes often with Nvidia when trying to minimize/maximize. Faster loading. THX.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Positives.---------------------Teaches about Car Parts and their effects on condition.Good Graphics.Smooth frame Rates.Nice looking Detail's of parts.The Negatives.---------------------This Game is not complete.Missing Battery Cables.Missing Fuel Hoses.Missing Radator Hoses.Missing Differential Gear Ratio options for the Drag StripNo Cars from the Muscle Car early years.No Workshop Options for our own Content.Most parts are all the same look such as Brake parts all look the same.This Game got very boring very quickly.Most of all, absolutley No Engine Animations whatsoever, no rotating or moving Parts.Very DissapoiningNeeded.-----------A Drag Race with other Vehicles would be the main addition that would make this game more complete.I myself do not have a problem of purchasing DLC as long as it is of good quality.Making DLC is not an easy task and takes a long time to get them looking good.Jon J.

												I wish there was a little more detail in the engine of the cars like the valve train and all the wiring and hoses leading to different parts of the car, but due to limitations in equipment power, I can understand why those were left out. Other than that little discrepency I think this game is absolutley great. I would also suggest if you plan on purchasing this game, get some of the dlc, because without it the game feels a little bit bland. I would suggest all of the tunning ones you have the money for.

												Not a true simulator in the sense of the word, however, many of the parts are in there and properly functions as they do IRL. HUGE grind at the start for XP to unlock the test path, paint booth and parking lots (plus the cash needed for each) which for me got old pretty fast.Once you open up the locked areas your next goal is to buy junkers from the auction block, repair/restore the vehicle to 100% and turn a decent profit or put it in your personal collection. That's it.Great way to pass several hours and have some fun.			",22,12,3,3,17,2,4

												I know nothing about car mechanics... NOTHING... I started playing this game out of curiosity and now I'm learning about all the parts. Graphics are OK, maybe a little outdated but not that much. UI is simple and helps you a lot if you know nothing about cars. It's fun. I understand the complexity but it would be great if the devs updated the base game and DLCs with more parts, aftermarket and/or even a mode to tune your own car. I don't know if more cars are unlocked with more XP or if what the game shows at the beginning is all there is. A couple more cars wouldn't hurt, still, like I said, understand the complexity of adding a car. I don't regret buying it. It's not an action or racing game. It's a game for when you want to think a little and if you like to tinker with stuff. Highly recommended!			",135,40,5,9,20,2,8

												The game in all is one of the few games that actually make me glad I am choosing to become a car mechanic in my future. This, although with a lot less of the frustration really working on a car can bring, is accurate, but only to an extent. As said by many people, it’s missing the human factor to it. From the “I can’t touch anything or I’ll have to clean grease off it” incident to the “I’ve lost the one screw and will have to replace the whole part” mistakes. It’s also missing the whole electrical aspect of cars; it would be cool if they could have cars that you would work on that showed you just what the working of a smart car is like.  I would hope that in future updates it will allow:-More car customization, such as different paint jobs (which can even be a part by itself where you have to paint each stencil/layer yourself)-Ability to work on the interior of the cars -Ability to go to car shows and drive the car around and get awards and money -As many car types as you can think of from all different car companies (Can give the ability of the player to load all or just some of the cars they want to work on) including different engine types -Create a customer system where people come in and have their cars fixed within a certain time span (have the phone for people who have bigger projects and have the schedule on computer) It's unrealistic that people would wait to have their car fixed while I'm out at auction and fixing my own cars or just goofing around-System so that you can sell cars to not just people at auction, but do trades as well-Allow players to expand the shop, adding more lifts, open floor areas, and have the ability to hire people in your own shop to help with buying items, fixing parts, testing and painting cars, even buying /selling cars, and even having them take care of a project by themselves -Different modes for players to choose from, such as casual (which is basically what the game is now), a career mode that would start with your business only getting a few costumers, would grow depending on the player’s judgment, and would have ways of advertising and seeing how well you are doing -Ability to add mods (which would help add new cars and different aspects while keeping the game itself simple and giving players the option to expand-Broken parts are not all rusted; parts can have breaks, malfunctions, be clogged but unnoticed until it is actually inspectedThe game as it stands is a good time consumer and definitely helped me distinguish that not every part is called “that round doohickey” or “that thing” due to that I have to look up every part individually by name in order to order a new one. It’s a great educational tool that is easy to work with and understand. What I find absolutely amazing is that even with my slow computer I can run this game with no problem with high quality and only minimal lag with ultra high quality with the only problem just being mouse movement is slowed. I like that it is realistic in the aspect that if you spend all your money on a car you won’t have enough to buy parts to get more money or fix the car and will eventually have to chop shop a car. What is nice is that the game is still being updated and actively worked on. It’s a game where sometimes I can’t stop until I’ve made enough money or until I’ve gotten down to only one customer but then I realize that I have parts to fix, then that I should sell some things, then that there is another customer. But wait, it’s a different car I haven’t worked on. Now I have to find the parts that need to be replaced because they are located everywhere or it has a V8 OHV engine and all the rods and rocker arms need to be taken out.  But then I’ve made the mistake of once again not going to bed when I wanted to. It feels like a Billy Mays commercial… “But wait! There’s more!”Overall, Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is an amazing game. I would even be willing to pay for updates such as the ones I’ve listed because just one of those alone will bring hours of more fun, discovery, and things to learn about.			",52,11,1,12,6,0,2

												As a car enthusiast in real life and a player of nearly all car related video games, I instantly fell in love with the Car Mechanic Simulator series thus far. CMS 2014 was amazing, but CMS 2015 is something entirely new. The amount of things the player can interact with in CMS 2015 has more than doubled than those from CMS 2014. You can now customize your garage any way you want to, have 3 cars in your garage at once instead of just 1 and work on them whenever you like, the auction house where you can buy a junker and fully restore it anyway you please, etc. Truly a classic for any car lover to spend hours upon hours playing!

												Awesome game. It won't teach you to be a mechanic - but you will tinker with the basic components of how a car works.In the game you will have to find and replace damaged parts, and as you become proficient at this you will have to start diagnosing whats broken. You can also try repairing parts to save dough. To make life easier, you will buy a variety of tools to test the car to find what's wrong, to make repairing go faster, etc.This game is a huge jump from the last version - and so if you like car games you should buy this for two reasons: a) it's a good game and b) the developers are really showing their skill and passion for this series; so they really deserve some support.+ decent graphics+ innovative gameplay+ excellent improvement over the last version+ interesting DLCs at fairly reasonable prices- sometimes confusing upgrade system - could use more cars- body work not has comphrehensive as engine and undercarriage systemstl;dr; if you have even a passing interest in cars, repairing them, etc - this is a great game.

But after you`ve figured out all these, this game will definitely make you spend some time on it. I usually play 4-5 hours every time...Besides, when you have enough money and experience to play with the auction system, congrats, you have reached the top level of the game, and watching the car that was utterly rubbish when you bought it turning into brand new shiny one, you would have the sense of achievement.Recommend it~			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really do like this game yes I may be kid that doesn't know that much about cars but i still have seen the negine of a car because my dad used to be a mechanic and he himself has spent hours on this game and thinks it's pretty realistic. Also the DLCs are cool and i cant wait for more keep it up. BTW this game has some pretty good tunes			",27,1,2,1,4,0,1

												Superb game, I can recommend it if you like cars and would like to know what could be wrong with them and what to check... I am a bit dissappointed that only Polski Fiat is in the yountimer extra DLC. I had from the former communist East-Germany  (DDR) a Trabant 601S. That is more famous, I would like to see or purchase that car as well as the old Russian Lada 1200 ...			",20,3,1,3,10,1,4

												If anyone has ever heard of ""Street Rod"" back in the day, this took me back because i myself am a fan and pretty sure i still have a copy on a floppy disk somewhere lol.Great game and well built.A bit too grindy for me though, would be nice if races were available as a way to earn more.Character levelling takes time but worth every single points.I am not sure if they have a radio in the garage to adjust volume and/or change stations.Cheeaap DLC Prices and more are getting added i guess.Great game, definately one for the collection and well worth the price.

												This is a great game who doesn't like to take apart a car repair it put back together and not even get dirty doing it just kidding on the dirty part. The only problem I have is in the stores of the game there are some part that are there but they don't have a car to use them on. Is that because your going to add those car or are they there for something to do. Also wouldn't mind seeing an improvement to paint like some strips and decals. And maybe one other thing being able to put dual carbs on the Tempest Magnum,Bolt Hellcat,Bolt Reptillia and maybe even a engine swap in these cars.			",0,6,1,0,7,0,0

												The gameplay is addicting, even for a person like me who knows (or knew, I guess I should say) literally zero about how cars work. A true gearhead will see more lasting value to the overall product. As someone who enjoys deeper gameplay elements, however, I feel there's something lacking. You the player simply work on cars to make more money, which leads to easier and faster methods of working on cars, and that's about it. I would have really liked to see a career mode in which you eventually own and operate a living, breathing shop with budgets to manage, employees to hire/train/fire as appropriate, and perhaps eventually build a nation-wide chain of shops if your business acumen is up to the challenge.In other words, great core mechanic mechanic (so happy I got to say that) that has lots of room for expansion as an overal game concept. Also maybe throw in customer interactions, crappier computers, weak coffee, deadlines for getting work done... the list could go on.			",65,11,2,5,5,0,3

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 does exactly what it says on the box, giving you the experience of being a car mechanic. As a simulator it’s exceptionally well done, capturing many of the aspects of car repair whilst not being as unforgiving as its real world counterpart is. However some of the more interesting parts of the game are hidden behind the levelling system which is too basic and takes far too long to get anywhere meaningful making it very easy to put the game down and forget about it. I enjoyed my time with Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 however if you don’t have an interest in cars or simulator type games then you probably wouldn’t find much more to love in it.Read my full review here: http://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2015/05/11/car-mechanic-simulator-2015-well-theres-your-problem/ ",250,98,2,15,18,0,22

												This review assumes you know Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 and it's game mechanics - either from playing it or watching lets plays etc.If you've played Car Mechanic Simulator 2014, this is a lot like that - a bit too much to my liking actually. It feels like what 2014 should have been, yet not a big enough step forward for a brand new game. I still recommend it because there aren't many games like this out there and it's got a reasonable pricetag for the value you're getting.This game is a bit more detailed than 2014, but shares all of it's good parts, so I'll just talk about things that I was a bit disappointed with:What I find is really lacking is a sense of progression. There are unlocks you get with experience but it feels a bit tacked on and not like a core game mechanic. I'd love to have either a story like in the similar Nintendo DS game ""Touch Mechanic"" (which is by the way a lot of fun) or a more extensive way of upgrading your tools and garage - i.e. starting in a small garage and buy better ones later on.What I think would be nice to have is a less strict assemble and disassemble order - allow me to make mistakes, for example get the order wrong in which I put together parts if I'm not careful. Let me interact with all the parts as I see fit - i.e. let me stop mounting a part mid-way and continue later if I want to - don't just completely remove it if I stop.The body-parts system is shallow - you take off and mount parts without so much as touching a screw. Similarly the painting system is just picking a color and pressing a button - I would have expected to spray the car myself.What I still hate since the first Car Mechanic Sim game is buying parts - it's a dumb waste of time to look up each part on a pseudo web-page - allow me to bulk order all parts that I found out need changing!That all said, if you like the concept of the game or the previous Car Mechanic Simulator, this is the game for you - there aren't many like it out there.For a future Car Mechanic Game I'd wish for these things:A physics system - no magically disappearing and reappearing parts - let me unmount them and physicalls move around the garage. It doesn't have to be as sloppy as in Surgeon Simulator, but something similar in concept would be fun.Also it would be great if one could unmount whole blocks of parts without taking it apart piece by piece.

Parts that need fixing need to be more than rusted. Rusted isn't always what's wrong with things. It would be nice to see some diversity, cracked, dented, barely hanging on haha. 2. It would be nice to hire people to do some of the more mundane jobs.3. Would be nice to customise your cars interior4. A race track would be a nice feature.5.

			Views: 1,004		

			Welcome back everybody, it's been a while I uploaded video here. Car Mechanic Simulator was just released and here is the first impression and gameplay on ULTRA settings.		

Ok well let's start quickly by saying if you played CMS2014 you will love this game, if you didn't play CMS2014 you will still love the game ;)I played lots and lots CMS2014 and couldn't wait for this game to come out.So what is the main difference between CMS2014 and CMS2015?Good quesion, but easy to answer.Everything is different ;)Lets start with graphics. Briliant, Absolutely superb graphics to the last detail. 5starNext, gameplay. Gameplay its similar to CMS2014 but improved a lot ( specially camera movements ) everything its a lot easier. 5starNext, parts. Car has A LOT MORE parts specially engine is absolutely design to the the last screw. Unlike in CMS2014 you can take whole engine apart, so you looking at more than 200+ parts per car. but I will try to take car apart and confirm this*. 5starThe garage and whole enviroment looks so real it will make you speechless. 5starYou can buy very cheap cars on auction and repair them put them together and sell them making lots of profit.And off course you can upgrade you garage tools and to get more cars in at once.Does game have any cons/something what needs improving? So far I haven't find anything bad ;) sorry my fault, I found 1 word in tutorial what supposed to be ""by"" and it was ""my"" so only this so farFinal verdict? 5 star game so very good price with absolute superb graphics and gameplay with lots and lots parts and you can use to learn bit about cars and engine ( kind of ) gives you idea what is where and roughly how to repair it :DI hope this is good enough to change your mind and you buy a game and enjoy it ;) Good luck and have fun			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great game. A huge upgrade from the 2014 CMS. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:- No storyline from what I can tell, unlike CMS 2014 where it was set up.- Classic muscle cars, my favorite.- Better camera than 2014.- Body modifications/jobs.- Basically a huge upgrade from 2014 CMS, I could list so many more things. Maybe take a look at the CMS 2014 trailers for a preview of the upgrades?Cons:- Uh, plastic rims don't rust???- When taking off a driveshaft on RWD vehicles (Bolt Reptilia, Hellcat, Magnum, etc) it is a little difficult to get a good angle, the best way to take off the drive shaft is to click the middle muffler and then unscrew the driveshaft.- No free roam as of now. You can get a parking garage and collect cars, but to be honest, whats the point of collecting cars if you can only drive them around an old factory test track? I would absolutely love to be able to drive to the Auction house/garage/test track myself. If the player doesn't have a car to drive there, they could just fast travel, what is in the game now.Overall the game is great, it's just the little tid-bits that make or break the game. I can see a lot of potential for more things to be added, such as free roam, the ability to put old engines in new ones, switch out a V4 for a V8, etc. A great simulator nonetheless, PlayWay is a great dev. If you're not nessecarily a car guy, and maybe don't know your way around a car, it might be a good idea to try out CMS 2014 first, maybe pick it up on a sale.Honestly CMS 2014 & 2015 are two of the few simulators that actually simulate, and don't run like sh*t.I'd also like to mention that the devs update the game rather than making the game a cash grab. They balanced the game, are planning to add more cars/features, and more.Definitely worth the $20.			",71,6,9,3,14,2,2

												Fun? Hell yes. If you love cars, Love taking cars apart or simple simulation type games, get this. It's fairly complex and has great goals to reach towards.Things to improve:1. Parts that need fixing need to be more than rusted. Rusted isn't always what's wrong with things. It would be nice to see some diversity, cracked, dented, barely hanging on haha. 2. It would be nice to hire people to do some of the more mundane jobs.3. Would be nice to customise your cars interior4. A race track would be a nice feature.5. After market parts to enhance the car past restoration would be nice as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

YouTube™ Video: Car Mechanic Simulator 2015-Live gameplay #1-Ultra settings-First impression with commentary 

			Views: 1,004		

			Welcome back everybody, it's been a while I uploaded video here. Car Mechanic Simulator was just released and here is the first impression and gameplay on ULTRA settings.		

Ok well let's start quickly by saying if you played CMS2014 you will love this game, if you didn't play CMS2014 you will still love the game ;)I played lots and lots CMS2014 and couldn't wait for this game to come out.So what is the main difference between CMS2014 and CMS2015?Good quesion, but easy to answer.Everything is different ;)Lets start with graphics. Briliant, Absolutely superb graphics to the last detail. 5starNext, gameplay. Gameplay its similar to CMS2014 but improved a lot ( specially camera movements ) everything its a lot easier. 5starNext, parts. Car has A LOT MORE parts specially engine is absolutely design to the the last screw. Unlike in CMS2014 you can take whole engine apart, so you looking at more than 200+ parts per car. but I will try to take car apart and confirm this*. 5starThe garage and whole enviroment looks so real it will make you speechless. 5starYou can buy very cheap cars on auction and repair them put them together and sell them making lots of profit.And off course you can upgrade you garage tools and to get more cars in at once.Does game have any cons/something what needs improving? So far I haven't find anything bad ;) sorry my fault, I found 1 word in tutorial what supposed to be ""by"" and it was ""my"" so only this so farFinal verdict? 5 star game so very good price with absolute superb graphics and gameplay with lots and lots parts and you can use to learn bit about cars and engine ( kind of ) gives you idea what is where and roughly how to repair it :DI hope this is good enough to change your mind and you buy a game and enjoy it ;) Good luck and have fun			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great game. A huge upgrade from the 2014 CMS. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:- No storyline from what I can tell, unlike CMS 2014 where it was set up.- Classic muscle cars, my favorite.- Better camera than 2014.- Body modifications/jobs.- Basically a huge upgrade from 2014 CMS, I could list so many more things. Maybe take a look at the CMS 2014 trailers for a preview of the upgrades?Cons:- Uh, plastic rims don't rust???- When taking off a driveshaft on RWD vehicles (Bolt Reptilia, Hellcat, Magnum, etc) it is a little difficult to get a good angle, the best way to take off the drive shaft is to click the middle muffler and then unscrew the driveshaft.- No free roam as of now. You can get a parking garage and collect cars, but to be honest, whats the point of collecting cars if you can only drive them around an old factory test track? I would absolutely love to be able to drive to the Auction house/garage/test track myself. If the player doesn't have a car to drive there, they could just fast travel, what is in the game now.Overall the game is great, it's just the little tid-bits that make or break the game. I can see a lot of potential for more things to be added, such as free roam, the ability to put old engines in new ones, switch out a V4 for a V8, etc. A great simulator nonetheless, PlayWay is a great dev. If you're not nessecarily a car guy, and maybe don't know your way around a car, it might be a good idea to try out CMS 2014 first, maybe pick it up on a sale.Honestly CMS 2014 & 2015 are two of the few simulators that actually simulate, and don't run like sh*t.I'd also like to mention that the devs update the game rather than making the game a cash grab. They balanced the game, are planning to add more cars/features, and more.Definitely worth the $20.			",71,6,9,3,14,2,2

Support from developers worked perfectly for the first few weeks, fixing every bug almost instantly and making improvements proposed by community. However it starts to be boring once you get all features available in garage (It takes over 20 hours).			",11,1,1,2,1,0,9

												Ah, the joys of repairing a car without all that mess with grease or risk of bodily injury while repairing and restoring cars.  I bought this game here after many hours of watching YouTube videos about it and it's older brother Car Mechanic Simulator 2014.  This game is fun yet extremely taxing on the memory, mainly to remember what parts you need to buy to replace worn parts in your orders or restorations.  For your first upgrades, I would recommend getting the tablet, then all three testing devices.  The tablet helps so you won't be making constant trips over to the in game computer to buy parts.  This will increase your overall productivity and make it easier to start gaining experience and money.			",6,2,11,0,23,0,2

												Very complete and real simulator! They should encourage kids to play this at school, learning so much. At the beggining is tricky and if you don't have at least some knowledge you will end up deasambling the whole car and assembling it again. As long as you know how an oil change is done and you are familiar on where some parts are located you should be fine. And if you get stuck in a job o get frustrated you can abort it without any penalties and then try different car jobs. After playing bread simulators, goat simulators, survivals of all kinds... I think this is the most and way far best simulator I ever played. 10/10... Of course if you are not a pretolhead or not interstead in mechanic or learning this game is not for you.+PROS:+you get jobs+you buy car parts+sometimes you need to examine the car and find out what is wrong with it (far more easy than it sounds)+remove/place parts one by one, screw by screw+get paid+buy tools and upgrades to improve your job+as more experience you make the more challenging and complex the game gets and more FUN+awesome electronic/EDM background music+no bugs found yet, exept once I removed a part and got it twice which is nice.+repair parts+sell parts+and more (yet for me to discover)-CONS-you can get stuck on a job, but you can quit it and recover-some parts are so small and difficult to find sometimes but thats part of being a mechanic simulator-needs patience-need to be intersted on cars or the science behind them (specific audience) ",48,6,2,4,11,0,5

												The visuals and gameplay mechanics are really good, once you get the hang of them, they feel very natural. At it's core the game is about finding faulty parts and replacing them with new parts. The challenge comes by not knowing which parts need replacing, and finding them using different techniques and tools you unlock along the way. There is also an auction system where you can buy cars, repair them, then keep them or sell them for a profit.One thing I really wish they had is some description of what each part does in the car. I have the basic understanding of how an engine works, but even the smallest blurb would have been helpful and a nice addition to the budding mechanic in all of us.Now for nitpicking, would it have killed them to put in a buy button to the work order? As of now you have remember the required part, switch to your tablet and find the part to buy. How about an indication of whether you already own the part? Instead you again have to remember the part, switch to your inventory and search it up. Sure, it's a simulator, that's part of the game, but it does get quite tedious and distracting when you have to search 20 different parts individually.Lastly sit down and be ready, unlocking everything is quite a grind, though personally I don't mind, I find it oddly meditative.

I'm not a pure-simulator kinda guy I think they are cool but get boring fast.But here I am in-game writing this review because I can't be bothered to shut it off long enough to write the review on the main steam window. Why is this game so fun? it shouldn't be this fun.Honestly $20 ain't asking too much for this game, but even better if you get it on sale (But then again ain't everything?)it has a slower start, but you won't be able to put it down especially if you like cars. If you don't like cars: why are you even reading this?This is the best  pure-simulator ever made, second only the Goat simulator.			",58,15,4,34,34,1,41

												Not a true simulator in the sense of the word, however, many of the parts are in there and properly functions as they do IRL. HUGE grind at the start for XP to unlock the test path, paint booth and parking lots (plus the cash needed for each) which for me got old pretty fast.Once you open up the locked areas your next goal is to buy junkers from the auction block, repair/restore the vehicle to 100% and turn a decent profit or put it in your personal collection. That's it.Great way to pass several hours and have some fun.			",22,12,3,3,17,2,4

												I wish there was a little more detail in the engine of the cars like the valve train and all the wiring and hoses leading to different parts of the car, but due to limitations in equipment power, I can understand why those were left out.

												The Positives.---------------------Teaches about Car Parts and their effects on condition.Good Graphics.Smooth frame Rates.Nice looking Detail's of parts.The Negatives.---------------------This Game is not complete.Missing Battery Cables.Missing Fuel Hoses.Missing Radator Hoses.Missing Differential Gear Ratio options for the Drag StripNo Cars from the Muscle Car early years.No Workshop Options for our own Content.Most parts are all the same look such as Brake parts all look the same.This Game got very boring very quickly.Most of all, absolutley No Engine Animations whatsoever, no rotating or moving Parts.Very DissapoiningNeeded.-----------A Drag Race with other Vehicles would be the main addition that would make this game more complete.I myself do not have a problem of purchasing DLC as long as it is of good quality.Making DLC is not an easy task and takes a long time to get them looking good.Jon J.

												I wanted to learn more about cars in a fun way. This game does that.I like doing things myself, and learning how things work. I change my own oil and brakes, but looking at the car all the parts were just a mass of inscrutable metal shapes. After playing this game for some hours, I suddenly saw all the parts for what they are. Running Gear. Sway bar. Tie Rod. Tie Rod End. Strut. Coil Spring. There are individual parts, and they have names and purposes.ConsThere are very few interesting decisions in this game.  There's no strategy elements like managing prices or over/under charging, no honesty level, no sales or marketing or competing with other mechanics. The process of repairing cars never changes. There end game is buying cars from the auction, repairing, them then selling or keeping them. Load times are awful for what the game is. The upgrades are boring. The UI when selecting parts can be finicky.I feel like it was a real lost opportunity that the game doesn't offer information about each part. I know I can go hit Wikipedia, but it'd add so much to my experience if I could just right click the timing belt and learn it's function, maybe origin and evolution. What is the difference between a carburetor and fuel injection? Why did older cars have a middle muffler? This would add a lot of resource to the game.Pros If you're looking for car knowledge, this is 1000x more interesting than reading a website or book about cars.It doesn't turn you into a mechanic, but takes the mystery of automobiles and brings them into the realm of the knowable.Your fingernails aren't black for days after.

												I love this game, I actually stopped playing games but I find myself playing this one, building cars from scratch, buying restoring and selling, just to do it all over, for more XP and money, Hell I got so much money I restore the customers cars as well. (If I owned a real shop people would love me haha)But in the end it is a game, even the devs said this is a game not really a part for part gutting of cars, but for the most part you can recognize parts as well as some very minor work. I think brakes, for the most part, but even then there are online manuels as well as actual books for peoples cars.But its fun.... To be the guy that is completely dry ♥♥♥♥ing the customer instead of you the person being boned with out lube when it comes to payment haha.I definitely recommend this game for those of you that are car lovers or are just generally fasinated by what goes in to a car. I applaud them with the DLCs and add ons. Not much for the community add ons but I like the game.This game inspires me to want to become a mechanic, I know it takes A LOT MORE work to become one and there will be no little outlines when I need to rebuilt but i love tinkering and fixing things.

												I think that 6 hours are enough for me to write this review...CMS 2015 Is a great step forward from the 2014.If you like cars in overall, you will love this game.Pros and cons:+You can own cars and you can make them look as you want.+The overall look of the parts is great.+you don't need to remove the whole exhaust to replace a manifold+tablet system (you can buy the part that you want anywhere, at any time)+upgrades and upgrade points+more scanners+you can change exterior parts (even lights)!+much more parts to replace-oil drain can be sometimes hard to operate with-Too much XP needed to have something. example: 9000 XP to have parking, or 1000XP for a 1 point.i would give 9.9/10.EDIT:Well, some cons are being added.-Tons and tons of DLCs-50000$ for a parking with 2 parking spots (idk how i missed that)The rating after a little change: 8.8/10, but i would still reccomend the game, because it is not the DlcDay 2			",134,21,5,8,35,0,5

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015. You can get rid of almost every part of your car, test your cars, sell them, even go to the Auction House and buy rusted, busted cars. The best part: Fix them and sell them for a WHOLE CHUNK OF MONEY. Also, there is a Garage, Paint Shop, and Diagnostic Test for your cars when you have enough XP. Store your cars in the Garage. Paint your cars in the Paint Shop. Test your car faster on the Diagnostic Test. I'd recommend this game to you.

												Being one who had purchased Car Mechanic 2014 and felt like i had wasted my money.  I was highly skeptical about the 2015 version.   After doing a lot of reading of reviews and such i took the plunge and went ahead and purchased 2015.  I gotta say I am quite happy I did.  Love the changes made to the game.   My only complaint would be lack of cars.  Hoping in the future that will be changed with DLC as well as mods.  But overall I am loving it.  I would would have to say this is a must have for anyone who enjoyed games like Gearhead Garage one of my all time favs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played CMS 2014, and it missed features and was way too easy. CMS 2015 is what i was waiting for, i'll be honest in this review.being a car enthusiast, i think CMS 2015 is great, for someone who enjoys cars and likes tycoon games, this is perfect. but, for someone that has a certain knowledge in cars and mechanics, this is somewhat easy. i think that they should add in CMS 2016 or hopefully in a update, difficulty levels. and more complicated problems, (Gaskets, Valves, and actual breaks, or option to disable the way that the parts look rusty depending  the life% of the part. Graphics Quality is great for the price but yes, you should buy this game. it is enjoyable. Buy parts, repair, collect.  and i'm not there yet, but body fixing is also a great idea. like buying used cars, fixing them and re-sell them. great idea!Will buy the 2016. especially for that price. cheap/good/fun/			",19,5,3,3,8,0,2

												I got last years game and decided to buy the 2015 version straight away. It's a good game!. Sometime a job will come along in the game and your be taking a lot of the car apart just to find that one faulty part. A basic knowlegde of cars is needed but you will learn fairly quickly about how to take the parts on and off and in what order.  Everything in the game is very decent or better, the sound. the graphics, the gameplay and so far i haven't come across any bugs. There's quite a few extra 'help' in the game like the OBD scanner or a test brake/suspension place in your garage but they cost one experience upgrade which is 1,000 XP in the game, It takes quiet a while to level up, so there's no way your get everything without some hours put in. My biggest problem with the game is the repairs list. You can only see what you need to replace on a list while near the car, once you go to the computer to buy new parts that list is gone. It can be very annoying traveling back and forth to the car to see what you need or you have forgotten. I do know once you unlock repair the items on a bench yourself, you won't need the list as much but i feel the repair list should always be available by pressing O, no matter where you are. Overall i'd give this game a 8/10.			",60,12,3,9,16,0,1

												CMS 2015 basically takes the 2014 version and improves it. They have different vehicles but more of them and somewhat more detail such as body panels, radiators and fans etc that sort of thing. I have enjoyed playing it though imo there doesn't seem to be much of a challenge financially as it's pretty much a continuous upward climb towards riches. At 9000 xp (7ish hrs for me) you unlock the abillity to buy cars in various conditions and fix them up which is fairly rewarding and has greater financial risk/reward if you don't manage your funds.All in all I wish the game was more detailed (ex. piston heads don't require removing bolts from underneath to remove, many bolted parts are simplified, no fasteners on body parts, only fluid you deal with is oil, so no coolant, trans, gas, wiper fluids etc all omitted, no hoses, no tuning, no interior parts, no glass repair etc. However it is still a fun game, and somewhat educational though simplified.TLDR; If you are interested in car mechanics you'll like this game, it isn't ultra detailed but it has enough to be fun and challenging at times. Do not expect 100% accuracy to real life.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game surpasses the original by a large margin. There are a few annoyances, such as:1. Needing to make sure you put replacement parts in the exact spaces they should go. for example, rocker arms. There are 16 of them on a vehicle, if you need to replace 3 of them, you may need to remember exactly where the 3 brand new ones are supposed to go.2. Insane amount of XP required to buy the parking garage, so you can buy cars at auction to flip. 3. Getting some jobs, where you need to paint the the car, even though you still need one or two thousand XP in order to unlock the paint shop.4. A few very minor bugs which happen where it doesn't let you work on anything, because it doesn't think you are looking from the correct position on the car (like looking in the engine bay, to work on the engine).5. Dumbed down some of the dual parts. such as suspension arms, you buy one type of suspension arm, and it works on both the right, and left side of the vehicle, which should normally be impossible.The positive definitely outweigh the negative on this one though. You can take apart far more pieces to the cars than the original game, the parts website has been upgraded with some search filters, and a functioning search box, to find exactly what you're looking for, continuous game play, and you decide what jobs to work on, and when. If you want to work on random job, just go to the phone and pick one of the four options, or after you get your parking garage, you can buy a vehicle at an auction, fix it up, and sell it for a profit.

												Being early in the release of the game and with dlc on the way, this game has impressed me and got me hooked, waiting for more...The detail of the cars is amazing, and while I thought it would be boring, I found myself hooked playing it for the last 4 days.  Troubleshooting and repairing vehicles is recreated in this game, however to a slightly limited scale. If I had to nit pick problems with their product here, it would be only that it is too basic. The idea that you canrebuild a car with a ratchet and socket is unrealistic, and I would like it if they added usable hand and power tools in the future. First and foremost in my mind should be a torque wrench, where you have to look up torque specs and sequence (could be done using the computer?) and having to set the torque value on the wrench and torque in sequence. welders and paint guns could also be neat to use when doing body work or painting. I think automatic transmissions would also be a must add.Im sure some of these features will come in time, but as of right now, im fairly pleased with the game. Id recommend it to any car guy or gear head in an instant.			",6,0,1,0,13,0,2

												This is one of those zen type games.  It draws you in and you just kind of lose yourself in playing around with the cars, removing parts, seeing what connects to what and how and then fixing everything and putting it all back together again.  It's very fun but also very relaxing.  It's kind of like when you're a little kid and want to take apart your toys or the toaster or a radio but here you don't have to worry about mom or dad smacking you when you can't put it back together again.  Not sure how realistic the game is in terms of learning how cars actually work but it's really fun and you can easily lose an hour playing it before you realize.  Definitely worthwhile.

												Incredibly fun game providing a good load of knowledge about car mechanics - instant fav!I remember playing Street Rod on C64 a long time ago where I could tinker around the car in a very limited way and I loved it. I'm interested in classic cars (now we have the second classic in my family) and that involves lots of real life mechanical repairs and/or adjustments which made me really curious about how to deal with certain mechanical problems. I'm extremely happy to have this game and getting a better overall view of the whole picture through it. Now it' much easier for me to approach towards any upcoming problmes of my classic :)CMS 2015 is literally an interactive learning material combined with game elements. Great thing, don't miss it!Update: I got my first complete restoration finished: a ""Bolt Reptilia"" (which is a Corvette literally) - it was a frenetic experience. Taking it apart bit by bit, remove every single part possible and rebuild it to a shiny 100% condition is just like a pilgrimage. The chrome is fantasic under the hood!

												Being a bit of a greese monkey myself this game is brilliant! Also a good game if you are just wanting to know more how cars work. The engine / suspension detail in this game if pretty accurate to the real thing.Having striped a small block 350 chevy engine myself I can honestly say this game has nailed it in terms of the processes you have to go through to rebuild an engine.The only thing it is missing is the - Cursing at stripped and rounded bolts, Being covered head to toe in oil and other crap, The yelling at sezied parts And the luanching of tools after hours of frustraion! hahahaOther than that 10/10 love it.I can't wait for extra dlc's with more cars variants and more complex engines v10's / v12's / flat fours and six's / inline six's *possibilities are endless*			",68,5,9,11,26,0,16

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is a solid improvement over 2014.  The amount of destructable parts you have is much better than before.  I like that you can now restore cars and work on their bodywork too.  The possibility of DLC should keep the game fresh with new challenges and vehicles unlike 2014 where once you have taken apart a v6 that was really it, game mastered time to move on.  I would recommend this game to people who are curious to see how cars fit together (all be it in a very simplified fashion).   However there are some drawbacks which I hope they iron out soon.1.  The music is annoying and repetitive, please add more stations and the ability to play my mp3s.2.  Colouring things rusty to indicate their condition really gives the game away.  I rarely need to use diagnostic equipement or test drives to isolate the problem.  Also, please stop giving me a list of things I need to replace, this compounds the issue. The whole point of the game to test my diagnostic skills and therefore the xp I get at the end of each job.3.   Using xp to unlock the ad-ons to your workshop like parking, paint booth and test path is stupid.  These should only be based on cash.  The whole xp to unlock thing puts the new car restoration part of game out of reach until the very end (9000xp = 100+ jobs) as you need to unlock the garage parking in order to visit the auctions.  I want to be able to buy a car and work on it slowely as money, skill and ad-ons allow.4.  Turning down jobs/doing a poor doesn't have consequences (except some xp)?!? are you kidding me? Customer rep needs to play a greater part.  As I recall there were repeat customers in CM2014 if my memory serves me correctly.5.  Tutorial needs to be bigger.

If people are still struggling to to find things in the campaign perhaps introduce Workshop manuals that can be bought via the PC or Tablet???Well thats enough of the negatives, all in all I still enjoy the game and for only $20 I really think you cant go wrong.

You can fix cars (obviously), you can buy cars at auction, restore cars you bought at auction, sell or collect cars you fixed after buying from auction and you can drive them too! How cool!There's lots of parts to rip out of your clients cars and put back in. I also like the decent amount of DLC that's coming our way lately. DLC is a must to make game more fun though.PS.

												I know nothing about cars other than my general knowledge of mechanical engineering. Cars were never an interest to me, and if something is wrong with my car, I always take it to someone to fix- never would I do it myself. Not even an oil change.That introduction aside, I LOVE this game. Even without that real-world interest level, this game is polished, sharp, and always has you eyeing goals in the future without holding your hand.  How rewarding it was when I was first repairing some more difficult issues, and without knowing where some parts were located, stripped down the entire engine of a car looking for those parts only to have to reassemble the whole thing- and get it right! It really is a great balance between simulating the work of a mechanic and gamifying it so that it's not quite so world-dreary and labor intensive.I am quickly banking cash and gaining experience with excitement, as soon in game I'll be able to buy a beat-up car at auction and fix it up to resell for huge profit as a side project in my garage.If you don't know cars, but enjoy simulations, progress, and have a bit of a mechanical-puzzle oriented mind, this is a very, very well done game and I highly recommend it. I may not be a mechanic after this, but at least my eyes won't cross in ignorance when someone says ""catalytic converter"" to me at the garage.Side note: I love the music in this game too. A great mix for working away at the cars in game.			",231,59,1,73,102,4,81

												This game is fun and a good tool for locating and replacing parts of a car.  I have some experience in auto repair and other misc. hardware as I'm a maintenance mechanic for the USPS.  Since I'm no expert in repairing cars and I like to learn, I enjoy this game and I've learned quite a bit from the repair jobs I've done so far.At the time of this review I'm only a few hours into it but already I notice some things I would like to see added for extra realism.  For example, hoses (air, radiator and others) battery cables and other major wires, various fluids like washer, brake, transmission etc. and gaskets in the engine would be a nice touch. Something else that would help with the immersion would be to have different size wrenches and sockets with ratchets to use on different size bolts and nuts. I think it's important to have a lot of different parts for the different cars as most cars take different parts in real life; at least for the larger more important parts.  That would be nice to have to look up the make/model in the computer to get the right part. :)  Honestly I don't think it wouldn't be that hard to add that if only they added part numbers to the car part inventory.  Finally I would like to see options of stock, upgraded and high performance parts so you can upgrade the cars you buy.  Overall though the game has potential to take many hours of fun and learning.

												Game is okay, spent some time with it and not too shabby though the features beyond picking and placing car parts is extremely limited. Processes in the game become obsolete as you gain money (get to the buying cars stage and you never have to go back to diagnosing or repairing other people's cars, just get yours to 100%). 4/10As far as advertising/exploitative marketing practices go, steer clear of obviously lacking expansion packs. The new Bentley pack has 5 reviews that share similar timestamps, similar usernames, no time played on the game, and all positive statements. Buyer beware.			",208,39,2,46,49,0,39

												Not accurate and too easy.This game seems to be aimed at people how dont know anything about cars, the type of people who wouldn't play this.this game is lacking many features, there is no wiring, no abs sensors, the engine bays are pretty much empty, no wipers or wiper moters, no interior lights, no exterior light bulbs, no fuses, no airbags or other SRS systems, no MULTI-METER no oscilloscope you can only use 2-post ramps, and you cannot open the gear box to work on the transmission you just have to replace the whole unit, same goes for all other parts they cannot be taken apart, there are many other things missing but it would take me all day to list them.BUT, for somone who wants a basic game its not bad, the graphics are pretty decent but the gameplay is lacking and I hope that a new verson of this game comes out where all the parts are present and where you can strip parts to work on them. Bare in mind I played on the harder mode the game offers so I'm going to imagine that the easy mode holds your hand.But I'm still recomending the game as it's clearly intended for children who would be overwelmed by too many parts.

Pistons, Crankshafts, Pushrods, Camshafts, all can now be disassembled. There's also bodywork that can be fixed, more engine configurations, This is essentially a direct upgrade of 2014. There's now an auction mode, and the devs have been stedialy releasing content as the game goes along.The only negative is you still can't rotate the camera on an axis.If you like working on cars, This game is worth a buy.

Yes, you may have to do a Google search for a part here or there on your first few jobs, but it's an excellent learning tool to develop a basic understanding of critical car components.The controls are incredibly intelligent and easy, and the ability to buy upgrades every 1,000xp is an excellent addition.I really hope they do a Car Mechanic Simulator 2016, and I hope they go even deeper than before.This is one of the most rewarding games I have ever played.

												This is a FANTASTIC follow-up of CMS 2014! I'm proud to see these devs were able to make the quota on KickStart! Awesome job, guys! Anyways, like any game in production it has its pros and it has its cons, but the negatives are miniscule, but can add to some frustration after a case of beer and lack of sleep. Here's my honest opinion:Pros: Great Playability Great Detail Beautiful Graphics Paint Shop with Custom Colors AUCTIONS!!!!! Multiple Jobs (3 to ~4) at once Tool Upgrades Shop Upgrades Fun Test Track New Cars Greater Variety of Cars did I say AUCTIONS?!?!!!!!!!!  (and also restorations)Cons: Limited Customization       rims, engine upgrades/swaps, interior are all unavailable as of this review. I was looking forward to being able to soup        up a sweet ride, maybe slap a v8 in a little eco-car or twin-turbo a 'Mustang', but I'm optimistic that some of these            will be factored in, in the future. Camera      it's a bit wonky at times. It's nice, during certain circumstances it works, but the automatic zoom and movement gets         frustrating at times. It is somewhat customizable, but still can become frustrating. Inventory      organization is mostly irrelevant. You can search between catagories (engine, drivetrain, suspension), which is       convenient, but one thing I was expecting to be implimented: vehicle catagories. Every time you go to a parts store,      you're required to inform the make/model/year, etc. If i had the ability to catagorize my inventory based on the       specific vehicle/engine type or based on the job, that would be significantly better. I can't tell you how many times       I've bought parts, tried to clear out my sh**-list parts, and ended up selling my recently purchased replacements.Limited Soundtrack      I will admit that some of the music is half-way decent and that it is a nice change from CMS 2014, however the list of       songs is quite short and they're all some form of a technoish sort. It's not a big fault of the game (being that you can      simply walk over to the radio and turn it off) but I, personally, would like to see some little-known artists of all       varieties of genres, not just Techno. (Rock, Hip-Hop, Country, etc.) When I'm in my irl personal garage, I have my       select types of music based on a variety of factors and situations and mood. That's part of what drives me to stick on            a job. It may be a miniscule fator to some, but in my experience, music really has an effect on whatever task or              duty is at hand.Altogether, this game is FUN! If you like cars, tearing them apart, or just want to gain a general knowledge on what they're made of, try this game out! It's quite enjoyable and will keep you planted in front of your monitor for hours, driving you to add just one more job, make just another couple extra bucks for that sweet restoration you just spent half your wages on at the local auction house. I love this game, I love the whole concept of a virtual garage (mostly because I can't break anything when i throw a ratchet across the shop). Thanks for reading! Hope it helps!P.S. Buy it. P.S.S.  Your wife should be used to you splurging on ""unnessecary"" purchases by now if you're really a car guy.			",74,16,5,5,29,0,6

												9.5/10!This game is a 100% upgrade from the already good Car Mechanic Simulator 2014. I played a few hours and realized, It has hardly any loading screens! Also the variety of cars is a step up too, Plus the many more detailed parts that have been added its like your working a real car. In this installment of the series you can have 2 cars in your shop at a time (3 If you know how to do it ;) You also can paint cars and replace the body panels as well. So what you waiting for? Go grab a copy.(PS: I have played the game for 7-8 Hours its just I play offline and steam doesn't keep track that way.)			",6,2,2,2,5,0,0

												Thanks For This GameThis is the first game I ever wished my dad was still around to sit down with me to see. He was a total gear-nut, and his idea of a great evening (or morning, day, night, ha) was to take a coffee out into his garage and poke around his vehicles.I never did aquire his love of mechanics, I instantly gravitated to the computers and electronics, being born in 1971.This game may get me a little closer to working in my own garage, just like dad would have wanted to see. Even a little demystification goes a long ways.So thanks!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Every time you open your inventory the cursor jumps to the center of the screen. After this happens a few times, your mouse is at the edge of your desk or knocking into your keyboard, so you have to pick it up and move it. Absolutely absurd.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So I've recently been playing My Summar Car (GO BUY THAT)... And coming from that to this, everything just felt a bit too simple, a bit too automated and a bit too 'spoon fed'. I'll admit I haven't played this for long, but I've played it for long enough to see how it could get repetitive.The thing that immediately turned me off is how everything is just automated. I feel like the experience would be a lot more immersive if you had to physically move parts, and generally if the jobs you recieved were longer as a result of this, but more rewarding as a trade off.If you're looking for something similar, but will give you something that has more of a sense of value than an XP/Cash number by the time you're done with it, check out My Summer Car.

												It's fun to hear the problem of the car (""rattling noise from the engine bay""), diagnose it regarding to the problem and then fix it. Also you got to upgrade your garage with a diagnose-track, a lot of utilities (OBD-Diagnose, multimeter, pressurepump,..) and you can even buy and sell cars later in the game. You learn some things about the parts of the engine, the chassis and so on. It's quite well made and more or less comparable to real life situations.BUT The game just advances waaay too slow, it includes a lot of grinding for experience-points and you see yourself just fixing the same thing over and over again just to get that paintjob-room and in the end it's not that special.It's also not really rewarding as it just takes too much effort to also get the little things. + I'm really tired of changing the f-ing tyres (haha).I paid 4€ for it, I would say I'd recommend it for that price because it kept me busy for one day but after that I couldn't really motivate myself again to continue.But as the normal price is 20€ I can't recommend it at that point.

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is a great game if you like to tear apart cars and then put them back together! I really like CM15 more than CM14 the graphics and abilities are much better in CM15. If you would like a somewhat insight to what it's like to work on cars, this game is good for that although it is lacking some parts such as gaskets, wires and a few other things that are found under the hood of common cars. I would recommend playing this game because it is fun and there is no need to cheat since you can earn money quickly, and grow your business fast, having 3 car slots open keeps you moving right along and a to do list it helpful to keep you wondering where in the car you will be next!

												A good relaxing game that can get a bit tiresome and repetitive. This game gets far better once you are able to go to auctions and buy cars to restore and customise. A big recommendation that makes the game better is to go into the game files and rename all the cars to their real life counterparts, it just gives you a better idea of what you are working on. Overall I'd give it a 7/10 without DLC and a 8/10 with DLC just for the extra vehicles as they are a bit more well known such as the Ford Mustang.  ",42,6,1,2,9,0,1

												This game is pretty good. I got it with all of the DLCs up to this point on sale and it was well worth it. Even though it is a ""simulator"" it is limited in what it simulates. It does let you take in repair jobs and remove old parts to replace them with newer ones. You have to put the cars on the lift to be able to access certain areas of the car; other parts of the car are only accessible under the hood. You have to remove certain parts first in order to get to other parts. You have to order replacement parts for the repair jobs you do. What the game does not simulate are things like the following: best practices, like disconnecting the battery before doing jobs like removing the starter and such. You don't have to torque done wheel lugs in a star pattern. You can't bulk order parts like spark plugs and oil filters that you are going to regularly need in order to get better pricing. As a matter of fact, you cannot even shop around from multiple suppliers to get better deals on parts. Another example is that you have an oil pan to catch oil when you drain the oil sump. However, if you use this, it is solely for role play purposes; you don't get a huge mess on the floor if you drain the oil with nothing to catch it. Also, you can remove the drain pan under the engine without first draining all the oil out.Think of this game as more of a 3-D puzzle game. You will learn the basics of what car parts are, where they are on the vehicle and how they fit with other parts. You won't really learn any real auto mechanics, though.I have really enjoyed this game, because there is always some new goal to work toward. As you get more experience and money, you can upgrade your tools and also your shop to make diagnosis and repairs easier and faster. Eventually you can buy your own car at auction and then ""soup it up"" but I haven't gotten to that point yet.This game looks good and the controls make sense, though there are some little annoyances like having to always use the ESC key to close windows instead of the key that you used to open the window. The music is terrible but you can turn it off.This is a good one if you like cars and want to pretend like you have your own shop. No bruised knuckles or greasy hands either!			",45,43,1,3,6,0,6

												I have been playing this for a good few days now, and It is a good game to kill bordam but that is it, its missing so many basic things out even a noob like myself knows, and some parts in this game should be mixable as they are in real life, we should also have sinbins for lets say spraying a custoemrs car another colour, more cars for the default game is really needed, sorry but making us by a few cars as DLC's is a rip off, open the game to the moders also you have a hole useless modding option.Custom options like better paint, vinals, inside of the car, better wheels and wheel colours, lights and so on, your mean to be simulating, why havenet any of these cars come in smashed, crash damage is a comman problem and a RSA car wouldn't come with a list of problems you would have to find them and see if the car was safe, in the UK you need a MOT also maybe adding options like this in to the game I am sure the US also has a car safty check it must past per year to drive.Its a OK game but thats all it is, its not really a Simulator as its not really simulating anything, Also stop making ever car have the same frame or engin, work on your moddles ALOT, add more flaver, maybe even add hotrodding and low ridding options to the game to make older recks worth restoring.

												The game is nice, enjoyable, fun and I really like the level of details being just right without being way too much nor not touching base. The fewer screws from the last version is surely welcome as is the much better graphics. The bad however vastly outnumber the good about this game.The absolute worst thing is the repetition. I bought the game for the promise of buying broken cars, fixing them and selling them back but guess what, that requires 9000 EXP and 50,000 USD to unlock. EXP is gathered snail-slow, 100 per fixed car and 1 for installing or uninstalling an item. That's 10+ hours for me and I'm still on 6,500 EXP doing the exact same thing on each car over and over again. In a way I guess the developers knew there isn't much variety in the game itself so the flooded it in a way that it needs forever to get you anywhere.I have a decent computer and still the game takes 15-20 seconds to load a car! I'm not talking startup time, each time you take a job, that's the waiting time before the car appears in my garage. Taking the car for a test drive, same wait. It's really frustrating.Taking off the wheels is driving me crazy. I am aware that most car fixes need the wheels removed but the game takes it to a crazy level. If there are 4 steering/suspension problems in a car, rest assured each is on a different wheel. Same thing for timing belts and things that require a lot of unscrewing to reach. 2 pistons on a V engine? Almost certainly on different engine-body parts. Again I think this is intentional to make the game play longer for lack of original content.Overall the game is good, I welcome the mechanical simulation part, quite nice but the game content itself is very short if the repetition is at least limited and the game should be priced according to this criteria, the current price is a highway robbery for the actual content.

												A good relaxing game that can get a bit tiresome and repetitive. This game gets far better once you are able to go to auctions and buy cars to restore and customise. A big recommendation that makes the game better is to go into the game files and rename all the cars to their real life counterparts, it just gives you a better idea of what you are working on. Overall I'd give it a 7/10 without DLC and a 8/10 with DLC just for the extra vehicles as they are a bit more well known such as the Ford Mustang.  ",42,6,1,2,9,0,1

												Aside from a few minor crashes (which I'm sure will get sorted out), this game is an absolute blast!ProsFar more in depth then the 2014 versionSmoother performanceThe price!Free DLCExcellent community feedback and involvment from the devs!ConsSome random crashes. (Again, I'm sure it'll get patched)Some annoynances that'll amplify in the late game. Such as trying to memorize a rather large order list on the computer.Very much a niche game.Overall, this game is an easy buy for me. The price, the devs, and the quality speaks volumes to that. HOWEVER, I caution anyone thinking of buying this game to do your homework first! It is a point and click style. Very Niche. And nothing you learn from the game will help you fix your own car. But if you can get past that, then pick it up!			",104,19,1,18,38,1,27

												This is a fantastic game! Very addictive. You just want to fix one last problem before you stop playing. But after you fix it, you end up going on to the next issue. I decided to test my knowledge a little and ditch the tutorial. I didn't do too bad, but I messed up when I first started playing. They should be more specific in the description of the issue. The first problem I addressed in game was the front wheel hub. Well, teaching myself how to play, this simple task took a little longer than it should have. After getting the front wheel and suspension all taken apart and getting to the wheel hub, I realized it was for the other ♥♥♥♥ing side (-.-)12/10 would recommend and I will be investing a lot of time into this game. If you like mechanical stuff or are just interested in seeing how cars work, do yourself a favor and get this game.			",35,0,1,5,1,0,2

												Huge improvement over 2014 and I like the fact that you can now have three cars in your garage at once instead of one. Its also nice that there is no more loading screens after you completed a mission and going on to the next one. I also like the new Visual Tuning DLC Pack so it is now time for a Performance Parts DLC Pack and also bringing performance tuning back like in 2014 and a DLC where you can do a 1/4 with the cars and a 4X4 pack like in 2014. But other than that great game. Its also nice that you can now buy upgrades for your garage. The only thing that is a downfall for me is that you cant work your way up to having better garages and that you use one garage all the time and also the fact that you need 9000 XP Points before you can sell cars on auction and lastly that it seems like all the wiring has been removed from the engine bay and that the parts are no longer connected to each other like for example the air filter is no longer connected with a pipe from the air filter to the engine etc. 8/10 :)			",4,0,1,0,0,0,0

												WOW - talk about exceeding expectations!I was very reluctant to buy this game so close to it's release.... the screenshots and description sounded great, but I was quite honestly - half-expecting to be disappointed.  It was a pleasant surprise to discover that this game was not only bug-free (at least for me, during the 30ish hours of gameplay) - but also a LOT of fun!The game is a very good high-level simulation.  It started off a bit slow, and there really wasn't much of a tutorial (at least not that I experienced) but the game is very intuitive.  I love the fact that you can upgrade your tools (although there is a limited number of options and once I maxed it, I wasn't sure what to do with the extra exp points).  The upgrades are actually useful (i.e. quicker assembly/disassembly of parts, increase chance to repair parts, diagnostic tools that tell you the ""condition"" of parts in the car)  I also loved the fact that you can go to the auction house and buy cars which you can then fix up and either collect or choose to sell.  There is something very satisfying about buying an older beater covered in rust and dents and restoring it with shiny new parts.  You can also ""test drive"" your cars - which I also thought was neat.TLDR - Great simulation game that smoothly delivers what it promises in the description (which is a rarity these days). Seems to be bug free and has a very intuitive UI - although I found I had to ""discover"" most of the things myself since there didn't seem to be much of a tutorial.  This is a real time-sink and I've caught myself a few times now going to the auction house, buying an old beater and meaning to restore just a portion of it... but once you start and then see another rusting component that you just have to replace (and have gotten so quick and good at it)... it really does draw you into spending far more time than planned.... If being a mechanic was this much fun and satisfying (and no grease on my hands) then I could see being a mechanic ;-)Definitely worth the price tag, and I hope that they intend to build upon this game (it seems to me like there are some areas in the game that were left intentionally empty - maybe for future expansions?)I'm happy with this purchase and will be keeping my eyes open for more games from these devs!

												I'm not sure why I got this game as I have little knowledge with cars beyond regular maintenace. At first it was a little intimidating working on my first few orders but it starts you off with simple things like replacing Fuel, Air, and Oil filters, and other simple tasks. Then you begin to work with different vehicles and much more complicated issues where you will need to competely break down the powertrain.Of course it's much more simple and MUCH faster than in real life, but it's been a lot of fun so far. Especially with the unlockable upgrades such as unlocking a Paint room, and getting more tools for diagnosising problems, and being able to repair parts efficently without ordering new ones.I'm still pretty new to the game with a few hours of gameplay, but I think it's a lot of fun. The visuals are great, the sounds of a car lift going up and down are great, as well as the music.			",941,373,35,98,123,11,187

												This game is great! Dev team are nice and helpful, and they fixed my stupidity with a problem. The problem is (if u guys have it) was that if u have Vsync off you have troubles moving. But on to the game. Its fun, interesting, and overall very educational on cars. I expected much from this game seeing how good the CMS 2014 game. But i was wondering (seeing how some sequals arent good) that this would be a flop. But it turned out great. Graphics are good, FPS is good, and most is good. The only thing i dislike about the game is the camera in inspect mode is a little wonky at times but i get by. Overall i would give this game a 9.5/10.

												First of all, being a Car DIY person, I do know a fair bit about cars.  It is also the reason why I bought this game in the first place.Car components are held together like puzzles.  Being a car mechanics (in this game), you need to figure out how to take components apart, inspect them and replace if necessary.  At first, it was kind of fun.  Especially it takes away the problems in real world e.g: cables in the way, not enough rooms to work with, bolts rusted up or even strips away.However, after about 20 hours of gameplay, car fixing is so repetitive and the fun kind of disappeared.  In my save, I had 250K cash trying to figure out what to do with it...  Sure you can buy cars from auction, refurbish it, then take it to drag race but that's about it.The other thing I don't like is loading time.  I had this game on SSD (8Gb ram, i5 4570 CPU) but each time I switch from location to location it will take 30 seconds to load.  Its like from Main menu into game 30 seconds (your garage), then from your garage to auction house, another 30 seconds.  I felt like I'm playing this game on CD or something.Game music is kind of cool initially, but after 5 hours or so, you would want to mute in-game music and play your own stuffs.Overall, I do have a bit of fun with this game but game-life is a bit short.  Consider I bought this game while it was on sales (75% off) I think this game is reasonable.  The DLC tries to expand the game-life a bit, but personally, I don't think it succeeded.

												Great Learning too. Teaches you how to locate parts, and what order you need to dismantle things to replace a part.I am almost a trained certified mechanic now and plan to open a business soon.10/10 rating. Dont expect it to be a fun game. Boring as heck, but teaches you a lot if you are a beginner.If you know absolutely nothing about cars, youre gonna have a BAD time.			",35,1,1,4,4,0,2

												This game is really fun!phone rings, and jobs come in and then you can accept or decline jobs.for example i had a job that needed a new ENGINE BLOCK!i literally striped the engine and some of the suspension to replace it.took me about a good half hour to 45 mins if you take your time not to make any mistakes.game is so detailed and for all of you petrol heads, its a damn blast 1 con --->>> not many cars to start with (its only been released to days prior to this review)			",74,3,7,1,14,0,5

												Get it! If you liked 2014, you'll love 2015. I dont feel like im being lead to the finish like I did in 2014. I love that the Dev's made this version to except new cars in the main game and not be made to play sepret expantion alone... I love that the Dev's are still adding thing to the base game such as the Tablet, new car and music for the radio. They took what they learned from the first game and the feed back from the fans and made a much better game. Rock on Dev's. I backed you in kickstarter and would do so agian with confadents. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, being a Car DIY person, I do know a fair bit about cars.  It is also the reason why I bought this game in the first place.Car components are held together like puzzles.  Being a car mechanics (in this game), you need to figure out how to take components apart, inspect them and replace if necessary.  At first, it was kind of fun.  Especially it takes away the problems in real world e.g: cables in the way, not enough rooms to work with, bolts rusted up or even strips away.However, after about 20 hours of gameplay, car fixing is so repetitive and the fun kind of disappeared.  In my save, I had 250K cash trying to figure out what to do with it...  Sure you can buy cars from auction, refurbish it, then take it to drag race but that's about it.The other thing I don't like is loading time.  I had this game on SSD (8Gb ram, i5 4570 CPU) but each time I switch from location to location it will take 30 seconds to load.  Its like from Main menu into game 30 seconds (your garage), then from your garage to auction house, another 30 seconds.  I felt like I'm playing this game on CD or something.Game music is kind of cool initially, but after 5 hours or so, you would want to mute in-game music and play your own stuffs.Overall, I do have a bit of fun with this game but game-life is a bit short.  Consider I bought this game while it was on sales (75% off) I think this game is reasonable.  The DLC tries to expand the game-life a bit, but personally, I don't think it succeeded.

Oh and buy everything button, I wanna buy all the parts for that car at once.....one more thing sorry, so up goes the lift to take oil pan off and barring or crank bearing off than lift goes down to take pistions out, lift goes back up to take the crank shaft out and lift back down for engine block, that's really annoying, pls take one of them actions away.

												I played this game for a night, a while ago. As a mechanic in real life, I enjoyed the game and figured I'd check back in on it eventualy. Such a great base for a game but a couple small things would really bring it forward and keep the game play fresh. I guess I need more on the management side of it.Fun way to learn some things about cars, although perhaps the game would be harder for people who don't already understand vehicles.I'd change my vote if they had addressed some of the player's complaints to simplify and complicate various parts of the game.As you level up, it would be nice if you have someone who brought the car to a lift and took the wheels off. Or you could provide orders to someone to keep a job moving or put a job back together after you finished the difficult part of it. Or have a rookie who can do the oil change for you. An experience mechanic RARELY finds himself performing basic services.Parts ordering: 2 years and not a single improvement has been made. With experience, I should be able to get parts on the way or make a check list as to what I need and then go to the computer to have it ordered. I thought the tablet would do this and it doesn't.Typically a mechanic has a list he hands off to someone, and they get the stuff on the way. Would love to see this.I'd also enjoy the challenges of delayed payments, as in the vehicle does just magically fly off the lift and cash goes into the account. You could have your assistant call to inform the customer the car is done, bring it to the parking lot and let you know your ETA on their pick up.Perhaps I just want a little bit more logistics challenge and less repetitive motions on ♥♥♥♥ like wheel removal and waiting on long vehicle load times every time I take a customer. Again the game is an awesome concept but could be tweeked for slightly less pointless repetition.			",36,5,6,6,30,0,15

												I'd recommend buying all of the DLCs just for the fun of this game cause it adds in more variety. However, this game needs: Trading cards, and badges Achievements! More things to do with cars (other than auctioning them, testing, etc) such as derbies, races, shows, and events Have your own name for your garage Change the weathers for more fun experimental simulations during test drives Option to turn off menu animations (mine always lag but the game runs just fine after getting into the actual game itself) Possibly have your own character just to fit in the mechanic side of it (and possible customise the character with car related stuff and more) Possibly have more game modes (such as time challenges, online racing, etc) Maybe have our own office to decorate with car related stuff and earned trophies and more (if racing gets added in) The mechanic doesn't always working in their garages, they work at pitstops and such!That's all this game really needs. Great potential for car lovers! Also, add more modern cars (McLaren, Tesla, etc)Subtitles if possible!			",24,3,0,3,1,0,0

												Okay so i have been thinking a long time before i thought about writing this review because i want it to be as truthfull as possible. So i have around 33 hours + on this game as i am writing at the moment and i think that if you are looking for a car game where you want to tune and fix cars, you are kinda on track and off track.Because CMS 15 is about fixing cars, but there is so little tuning options and customising options when it comes down to it. As well, when i started this game i bought because of the restoration part... But i got dissapointed, there is endless of fixing cars on contract before you can even get to an auction, you need way to much xp to unlock everything as well. If i could choose i would have wanted to do it more simple like in real life, that you have to pay and expand you way, and not with xp and pay. And except that there is a lot of cars to choose from which is a big +, but it's kinda all the same, because there is not much diffrent motors or car parts. And it explains itself because it is a Car Mechanic game.So what is the Pros and Cons?Pros--Many diffrent car models-Fantastic looking Grapichs-It is what it is supposed to  be-You have a lot of diffrent things that you can do on a car-A lot of rimsCons-You need some damn good patience-It circulates in the same jobs and same parts all the time with small exeption of diffrent parts to switch out-Have to get Xp to unlock, paintshop, dyno, test areas and auction house, as well to pay money for service areas-To little custom car parts, and diffrent ways to tune.-Having to buy all the content because it is DLC and not just normal contentAnd that was it, this is my opinion the game could be much more but it is what it is			",73,9,13,9,31,1,5

												i bought this game to purely learn about the inside of a car and to see how to replace things like a real mechanic,  and guys i will say I'm impressed.   I've worked on real cars before and this replicates it to the bone marrow.  This game has a lot of scenarios so you basicly figure out any type of problem that could happen to your car.  One other thing the creator actually makes you figure out where the wared out parts are.  There is no guide line to tell you where the part is located.  You either will have to undo the car peace by peace to see where the malfunctioned part is or simply look on the internet to see where its located at and then do it in the game and trust me your going to learn a freakin lot on how to do stuff yourself.  For christ sakes if you just want to learn how to do a perfect oil change.  Get this game!			",65,2,1,5,2,0,1

												in this last review, you guys could make better compatibility with windows 10.in my windows 7 runned good... now it´s a crap with windows 10You gonna waste 1/3 of your time in loading screens. 1/3 of your time trying to level and 1/3 of your time thinking if you gonna uninstall this game.I remember the old good Gear Head Garage. Was fast, was simple, fun to play. This game is going to make you nervous. Mainly if you forget to backup your savegames. Isn´t in DOCUMENTS folder. It´s real hard to find.

I do reccomend this game, but only at a sale price of over half off because fixing cars doesn't get different once you get through all the things to fix. Everything to fix just gets recycled with either different cars or different objectives for a car.

												At first, it was hard to figure out the controls and what everything was, but once you know what you're doing, this game is extrememly fun. It's a great game for car enthusiasts and is relaxing to play casually if you just want to take your time repairing and driving. The only bad part is even with the 4 dlc I own, there isn't very much content for replayability or incentive to progress after about 25 hours of playing.			",35,3,1,4,5,1,1

												I liked CMS 2014 but it had some rough edges - fortunately 2015 fixes quite a lot of those!!Obviously it's introduced a few of it's own (it's tiresome ordering large part lists) but otherwise it's a better game in most ways.One word of warning, it's a slow-burn game, it takes a LONG time to unlock stuff (hours and hours of player are required to unlock the car tuning/reselling for example)If they keep enhancing it at this rate tho, 2017/2018 will be awesomesauce - as-is this is far from a light update, there are genuinely good improvements to how you interact with the car, more diagnosis tools, clearer descriptions for the jobs etc. etc.Overall, I think this is well worth a look if the idea of a car fixing puzzle/spanner simulator appeals to you - and I can't wait for the next one! ;0			",606,162,56,93,89,4,107

												I would really recommend Car Mechanic Simulator for everyone who is interested in cars and how they work. If you have the previous version of this game (Car Mechanic Simulator 2014) and you like it, I still recommend buying the new version since there is a significant update over last version: cars now have much more parts, engines and car bodies can be disassembled and repaired. Now in later stages of game you can buy cars, repair them and sell for profit. The game today also got a FREE content update in form of a new car to repair, the developers said there will be more free content updates. I as a car fan find this game really enjoyable and recommend this to everyone who is interested in cars.			",82,10,1,6,8,0,6

												I do like this game, and I am a retired auto repair shop owner.  I bought it in alpha and enjoyed it and played it a lot early on.  But after a while the challenge diminishes rapidly.  It only takes a few times to learn a car, and new cars are not much of a challenge.  The DLC of new vehicles are expensive and there should be many more vehicles in the base game.  The vehicles are typically based on a basic format so if you have 4WD DLC your just getting one basic vehicle with some minor changes between them.  They represent different companies but are all designed the same.  The only really different vehicle is the Maluch, and its, just weird.  All in all I played over 120 hours.  You have to have the visual tuning DLC to make the game playable, but they charge seperately for it, so you know what your in for with this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome game!  Though i'm not too happy with the lack of custom stuff. I know this is a ""mechanic sim"" not a ""custom car sim"" Although I'd like to see more options when rebuilding a car. like more rims ( they have added more rims! ), super chargers, spoilers, hoods, two tone paint, car vinyl wraps, full stereo system, exhaust tips, side pipes, neon lights  being able to change the color of the dash, seats so on and so on.  They could really make this game bad a$$, they just need to step up with more options.   6/10    Update: They are adding more visual upgrades and now any rim can be mounted on any car. If they keep it up this game will be better the Gearhead Garage!!    The developer is on top of this game with fixes and addons! worth supporting the devs!!			",99,42,11,24,45,2,12

												I do like this game, and I am a retired auto repair shop owner.  I bought it in alpha and enjoyed it and played it a lot early on.  But after a while the challenge diminishes rapidly.  It only takes a few times to learn a car, and new cars are not much of a challenge.  The DLC of new vehicles are expensive and there should be many more vehicles in the base game.  The vehicles are typically based on a basic format so if you have 4WD DLC your just getting one basic vehicle with some minor changes between them.  They represent different companies but are all designed the same.  The only really different vehicle is the Maluch, and its, just weird.  All in all I played over 120 hours.  You have to have the visual tuning DLC to make the game playable, but they charge seperately for it, so you know what your in for with this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had no knowledge about car parts or any mechanic stuff, i bought this because simply i love cars. And oh boy i got hooked. And here's why i love this game so much:Story:You're a car mechanic and you fix'em cars.Presentation:This game didn't really go for photorealism despite being a simulator, and some parts look really funky at times, but most of the time it doesn't really matter because this game runs really smooth and you don't need a beast to run this very smoothly so good optimaztion there. And mostly i didn't really cared about funky looking parts because i had so much fun. Oh, i almost forgot to talk about how much detail and effort has put into this game. You will be surpised to see how detailed the car parts are even thorugh they didn't went for the photorealism.Gameplay:Gameplay in this game is so addicting and fun for both car lovers and problem solvers, so in the first few jobs the game tells you what to fix, but 3-4h in the game gives less infomation about the problem and you need to dig(or shall i say, screw) your way into the car to find the problem and replace it with new parts. Also this game really teaches you about car parts and how to remove them and put'em back in. It is a very fun and addicting IF you're a car lover like me or a problem solver, novice mechanic, or people who like puzzle games. Well if you're not one of those people i suggest stay away from this game because it's not for you.Overall:Overall this game is perfect for Car lovers, problem solvers, novice mechanic, and people who like puzzle games. For those people this game gets 9/10 BUY THIS GAME NOW. But if you're not one of those people do not purchase this game. I myself would put a recommended review because this game deserves more positive reviews.			",112,6,1,14,3,0,4

												This is my Review for the Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 (CMS15) after playing it for about 10 Hours now (which Steam did not record correct, im sorry). Interface I´ve read some of the Negative Comments to this Game and most of them ctiticise the Interace of CMS15 f.e as ""poor Choice"". I´ve played CMS14 (the Game from last Year) and have to say, compared to the Interace from that the new Interface has some advantages BUT also some Disadvantages.Clearly the New Interface looks more Fancy and more Dynamic then the old one. The old one had always the Feeling of something static is going on with no Dynamic in its moves (f.e when looking closly to a Wheel etc). The new Interface solve this Problem with a lot of good Animations and good Grafics (comapred to CMS14). It also feels a bit smoother in its Animation, which offers a Great feeling when using it.The New Interface is also easier to handel for People who are new to the Car Mechanics Simulator, for Players of the Old one its kind of hard to get used to it, but personally i think thats still an advantage, cause its overall better in the handling.But there are some negative Things i dont want to Skip here: I persoanlly dont like the new Highlighting of Parts at all. Its sometimes very hard to Spot something you have simply not seen, if you want to remove a certain part. Also the Assembeling and Disassembeling is really hard now, cause the Highlighting is pretty poor and bad. Another Thing that is really annoying to me, is the Fact that you cant switch the Conditions View on while working on the Car. That was possible in CMS14 and made it a lot easier to get the Parts selectet you want to select. Now that Function is missing and its quiet Hard sometimes to get the Parts selected or even spot them.But overall its acceptable for Fans in my Opinion, cause it makes the Game only Harder not runins it. Gameplay The Gameplay is much much better then CMS14 for me. The Cars are more Complex, you can Filter the Categorys from the Shop on the Computer, you have different Things to Buy, Customize and so on. And you can Finaly reject Jobs that you dont like, and thats cool.I dont know how many times i had to remove a entire Gearbox from a V6 4x4 in CMS14 and was simply ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of it (cause its very low payout and very hard work), so finally i can skip Orders like that, yea :D.Players who played the old CMS14 will like the new CMS15 very much in my Opinion, cause its solves a lot of Problem CMS14 had Sound This is a very negative Part for me. I´m a huge Fan of Music and Soundtracks and listen to Music like 5 to 6 Hours a Day. The Soundtrack from CMS14 had something for most of the People. Some Rock & Metal for Guys with a ""harder"" Taste, some Techno Music for People who like that or some Dubstep for People who enjoy the Electrical Music as well as some good other Tracks. Sure not all Tracks where for everyone, but you could say that not 1 was really ""Bad"".In CMS15 my Ears are bleeding to be honest, cause this Soundtrack is really awefull. Not only that there are some good Rocky Songs are missing, not the whole Soundtrack is more like a Techno / Dubstep / and things like that Album. F.e there is this Song from a Girl with some Douett Part in it (the only one) and i´ve never heard a Professional Singer in a long time, who misses so much Notes like she did in only 1 Song. And this Pattern of awefull Music is applied to all Tracks in CMS15.If there is CMS16 planned (dont know it atm) please take more Time for the Soundtrack and dont choose this Crap again. Its nice that you want to support ""little"" Musicans (as far as i see they are all not that Popular), but please choose those who have talent :). Conclusion I´ve said a lot of positive Things, a lot of negative things and a bunch of awefully things about CMS15. Now its the final moment: Would i reccomend it or not. I have to say, personally, i would reccomend it for Poeple who played CMS14 and people who like Simulator Games. Its a good, nice puzzle Game which can provide Hours of Fun and you can acutally learn something about Business Management and Cars as well (not much, but at least you now know where your Cars Gearbox is right?).

												Great idea. The trouble is you don't play a good idea. Your clicking parts on and off a car. All the cars use the same set of parts. There are some tuning options but they are very limited. Don't think you can chop and change engines etc. Limited choice on wheels with no real choice on width or diameter. So you click parts on and off  a car. Then you get to set it up on the dyno. This is 3 buttons you fiddle with till the mixture is right. Doesn't say what you are actually doing and its so random you might as well throw a dice. Then theres the drag strip. Throttle is just a button so if you have a car with decent power your either spinning into the wall or short shifting gears so you never get a meaningful time anyway. Like I said a great idea that very soon becomes very boring.			",9,1,5,1,12,0,2

												If you're a gearhead, but just don't have the time to work on cars as it is, this game is for you.  Yeah, there's no ""end game"" or ""end goal"" but there are lots of goals along the way: get equipment to diagnose problems easier, get a place to store cars, buy cars and restore them, customize cars, etc.I played the last game, and I'm very surprised at just how much better this game is.  Initially, I was worried this game might go the route of the city building game, where basically you were paying full price for what was a patch.  Not with this series!  I can't explain just how much of a massive improvement this game is over the previous one, and I had a great time with the last game.The engine is very smooth, and they keep tweaking it to make it run better.  Attention to detail is very high, I'm surprised at how nice the shop looks.  It would have been cool if we started out in some ratty shop and eventually paid our way via hard work and business to a cool high-tech shop, but beggars can't be choosers, and I understand that would add extra development time.The game gets very detailed in the repairs, and I'm hoping the next version of this game gets even more detailed.  The fact that you can dissassemble engines all the way down to the crankshaft is impressive.  There are variations to the engines in that you work on 4 cylinder and 8 cylinder layouts as well at 8cyl with DOHC.At first it may feel like you gain experience slowly, but I feel the pacing is pretty much perfect.  I've put in a lot of hours and I'm only about to start bidding on cars and restoring them.  I'm a very casual gamer and feel the pacing fits my schedule perfectly.The devs actually monitor the forum and listen to suggestions.  That's great!This game is very therepeutic for me, it's so relaxing to just sit back and work on a virtual car.  Anyone who has wrenched on a car knows it's not as easy as this game, so it's nice for everything to work out so smoothly.As far as where this series future goes, I'm just hoping it gets more detailed and realistic.  I'm so glad they have a well optimized game engine as it is, as well as their attention to detail.This game is worth far more than $20, and I would have gladly paid $60 for it.The devs have set a HUGE benchmark with this version,  they have their work cut out for them in the sequel!  Great job.			",173,5,7,20,25,0,25

												Slow, progress is painfully slow, so slow it's like having a dead end boring job in real life, Except you don't get paid, so... total waste of time. The game is fun, initially. It's fun when I fix the first car, it's fun when I fix the first complex part. But, you'll need to fix the same boring simple car, screw and unscrew the same spot thousands of times, BEFORE you can even get to play with the second car.Just speed up the experience and money! or just open up all the cars!Seriously, why?Game developers don't get paid extra for holding gamers playing longer (by wasting time). It's a single player game, and a car mechanic game, there's literally nothing to brag about for spending(wasting) so much time on it.It's the desert bus game with a better interface. Playing it should be considered performance art.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This felt more like a demo than a full-fledged game. People bring their cars in and tell you what seems to be wrong. You unscrew an endless series of bolts, find the faulty part, order a replacement, then put everything back together. The game uses color cues to tell you which part is faulty, and guides you as your reconstruct the relevant part of the vehicle, so there is very little challenge. It got old after about an hour.3/10			",91,18,3,19,27,3,31
