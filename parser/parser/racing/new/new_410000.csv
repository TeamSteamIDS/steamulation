								Hey there! I am a (actualy quite new but eager) fan of your work and came along Chalo Chalo while playing Ibb & Obb with a friend of mine. A few hours later, we were eight people sitting together and yelling curses at each other while playing your game :blueduck:No but seriously, pretty cool game! You can easily turn it into a drinking game if you want, and people can join or leave the game without realy breaking the flow or tension. Thumbs up!			",66,7,2,7,6,1,9

								I have met with the developers at Indiecade Europe 2016 and had a chance to try the game there. Bought the game immediately after that.It is a great party game. The controls are very simple and very easy to pick up. When I play with my friends the goal for everyone is usually not ""to win the game"", but to ""to prevent others from winning the game""; so it is a great example of a ""Friendship Ruining"" game. About 10 minutes into playing everyone will start yelling curses at each other. Recommended.			",153,48,1,17,18,0,13

Alpha reviewThis hidden gem is currently in it's alpha stage, so there is room for improvements here and there. But honestly, they're not big enough to mention - especially since the devs are already working on the issues I could find.Currently to play the game, you must be at least 3 people (5 and above is recommended). You start the game, and plug in your controllers or you can use your smartphone by downloading the Chalo Chalo app. Just make sure you are all on the same WiFi network and you're good to go. The game and controls are very easy to get into and shouldn't take many seconds to get a hang of. Which is also the reason why this is the perfect party game, even for non-gamers.If you have friends and like indie, couch or party games, then this is a must have for you.Other games from the developers:- ibb & obb			",40,1,3,2,4,0,1

								Love this game (I've played a few early builds before this arrived on steam) - It's so easy for anyone to pick up and loads of fun, one of those games where a 10 minute session easily turns into a couple of hours. between the random race tracks and the inventive powerups there's just the right amount of depth to keep each match fresh without clouding the purity of the game.  Well worth having up your sleeve for when a couple of friends come round, and essential if you often play games with two or more people.The wifi phone controller app works flawlessly on iphone as far as I can tell - I assume the same is true on android, so no need for a cupboard of controllers!

								The good: I love party games.  Chalo Chalo is a great party game.  Had a blast playing it for about half an hour on a friend’s machine with a group of seven people at various levels of intoxication.  The game was everything that was advertised.  Easy to pick up, everyone could get the controller app, and connect in under 5 minutes.  The bad: We had a few issues with disconnects mid-game and players' dots would just wander off the screen.  Also, I get that the devs are probably going for some aesthetic with the pastels for each player’s dot, but half the players had a hard time picking out their dot.  The unacceptable:  One of our players was colorblind.  The player couldn't tell the difference between the fast (green) and the death (red) tiles.  Considering that around 1 in 20 people are colorblind and the game is made for 8 players, the likelihood that someone at your party is colorblind is fairly high.  It is completely unacceptable that there is no colorblind palette option. Add a colorblind mode.  Add a mode with more distinct colors for the dots.  TL;DR: Chalo Chalo is a fun party game.  It needs a colorblind mode or you won’t be able to play it at parties. ",53,2,1,1,6,0,5
