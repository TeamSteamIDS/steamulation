												Well. The Crew... I honestly was dying to get this game, and I dropped the $85 for the gold edition. I figured since I loved racing games to death that this would be the perfect fit for me. But boy was I wrong. I do have a lot of fun on it but beware, the car physics are horrible and the map is sub-par at best. You get this hype from looking at the game that it's going to be awesome with a gigantic map and tons of cities to drive through but then you get in and BAM, there's only 2 cities that are slightly like 10% close to the historic scale of it, and those two are LA and New York. The problems with those are they take up 1/4 of each region they're in. West Coast: 75% nothing, 25% LA. East Coast: roughly 40% New York and 60% Hills and forests. The handling in the game is sub-par too, which I kinda braced for knowing it was on a havok engine. But when you really get into it it's one of the single most disappointing things in the game. Most of the cars either handle like you're steering them with your feet or handle like you crank the wheel over on each turn even if you're trying to only follow slight contours in the road. +The cars are nice+The map is still nice despite the major lack of any cities between New York and LA+Bonneville Salt Flats is acutally made to a barely historic scale (only for the speed area)+Street cars handle pretty well+Circuit cars are hilarious+Circuit Silverado+HUMMER-Miserable offroad physics because of the vehicle flipping limitations, Raid car physics leave a lot to be desired-crash cutscenes are the most annoying things ever and tend to take ~15 seconds to go away-Missions are subpar at best-Campaign is linear and not even racing-some of the fastest cars in the game are some of the slowest performance cars (Koeniggsegg Agera R: 279 mph fullstock (amazing buff), and 219mph level 1299 perf tune. Real/recorded top speed: Nowhere near any of these at 263mph)-Between LA and New York the cities are horrible and very half ♥♥♥♥♥, 90% of the giant cities that rival LA are just represented as small towns (Dallas, Washington DC, etc...) -A lot of major cities aren't even represented in the game (Houston, Phoenix, Glendale, Palm Springs [I know it's in the game but that's like one house, palm springs is a pretty nice place], Denver, etc..)-The game feels like minimal effort was put into it.--Crashes every 1-3 hours, usually during something important like the end mission or a skill--Graphics depend too heavily on shaders and shadowing, not real effort and modelling skills.-Cops are kinda annoying but really not bad any more, updates changed the police and made them hilarious golf balls for Hummers.-Tuning the H1 to Raid spec is horrible because it tunes it like a gas engine. The Duramax LLY diesel tuned to 600hp on a would NOT have only 700lb/ft of torque, it would EASILY be in the 4 digits (around 1,150ft/lb) for torque and it would be unstoppable. Work on diesel engines, then it gets my vote (granted it's an extremely small gripe because I still love the H1 to death ingame)-Mapping is horrible, around Black Mount there are patches of trees floating 5 feet off the ground and trees growing in the middle of the train tracks that the train just drives through, and in New York the storm gutters in the tunnels underground have no collision meshes and your wheels get stuck underground if you hit that area.My personal thoughts on this is they should put it as an early access game, not a full release game. This release is just.. For lack of better word, it's just not good, it's an incomplete game marketed as a full game. If they announce they have no plans to do any major revamps I would never recommend this to any of my friends. All in all, The Crew pretty much turned out to be exactly what I hoped it wouldn't be, and that is just another overhyped game that isn't worth the money, destroyed by Ubisoft forcing the game developer to cut a lot of corners and release a broken gameEDIT: My view of the game went up a lot with the addition of the Mini with a circuit tune and a Ford Focus with a Raid tune (the 2 funniest cars in the game now) There were plenty of updates after that but I have neglected to mention them, but it's still not worth paying the full price for, anyone interested should get it while it's on sale.Another edit: They fixed a lot of the AI issues, the races are extremely easy to win now if you play your cards right. The cops are like golf balls for Hummer golfing.Still not worth the price tag, though.Thank you for reading.The game is getting better but it still leaves much to be desired.EDIT: 1/27/2016 Also since Wild Run released the game WILL NOT run AT ALL for some reason.EDIT 11/23/2016 I fixed it and it runs fine, still the same issues and fun things though. Again, not worth the money whether or not it's on sale. UBIsoft even tried to give it away.			",111,6,2,12,7,0,14

├Professors Review┤Game Pros • Open World • Day/Night Cycle • Large selection of cars • Multiplayer • Tons of cities and areas to explore • Car customization • Weather System  Game Cons• Basic storyline (Takes a very short time to beat, 1-3 days max depending on how long you play)• You can sometimes get disconnected from the server (After a long race, it sucks)• Handling is quirky (After some upgrades it gets better)• Some races make you rage quit (Not really a con. Just fair warning)• You can only see up to the 7 closes players to you. Which makes the ""MMO"" title feel lacking.Relateable Games • Forza 5 • Project Cars • Burnout Paradise ConclusionOverall, the crew is a really good racing game. If you're looking for another one to get into, I'd highly suggest this one. Not just for racing, but also the exploration factor. With all the time i've put into this game, I havent even seen 75% of the map.(If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!)Looking for more steam friends? Feel free to add me!

												This game can be summed up into two words, ""Wasted Potential"". The Good- Large detailed map than can be driven for hours on end with little to no repetitionThe Bad-Sub par car selection-Car/Driver levels are pointless as all races/racers will scale to you- Cheap AI features that borders on cheating/hacking, they can move at impossible speeds, plow through obstacles with no slowdown, will rarely spin out while a slight nudge will send you flying-Bad navigation system, so many times the navigation system will point me to an off-ramp only to curve back onto the highway, or will direct me through obstacles including wallsSimply put this is a lazy attempt by the devs, they did not put proper effort to make this game fun. Instead they took the cheap way out and its more frustrating than fun. It is not an MMO. They intend to  fix the problems but this is just another game that follows the disturbing trend of releasing unfinished games for full price then slowly fixing it to be what it should have been. I wish i could get a refund and spend the money once I  see a REAL COMPLETE game but i guess i just have to hope they actually do what I paid for.EDIT: Please remember the history of the game that when i wrote this review it was a buggy mess, there have been updates and changes to it but I for one am finished with this game for now.

												Over time and what not, Ivory Tower corrected some of the issues. Corrections are written in italic after each section. Enjoy reading!After more than 70 hours of playing this, this is what I observed:""RACING-MMO""? Announced as an Massively-Online-Multiplayer-Game, a single Session only holds 8 Players. ALSO: Uses NAT-Connection system. A player who is not in your region won't necessarily be able to join your session. The Crew (Steam Worldwide)? Yeah, sure. (April 2015: They improved matchmaking, merged PvP-Lobbies and improved game hosting, it's basically faster now. No other sewere issues were changed online-wise.)CARS: This game holds a breathtaking amount of 27 cars + DLC cars. And they are not even available in every spec. Test Drive Unlimited 2 had 130, for comparison. They also handle next to nothing realistic. Muscle cars have better grip than a BMW. RWD, FWD or AWD? No difference either.(March 2015: Handling SEVERLY improved, more and more specs got/get added every month. April 2015: More specs added, Raid DLC pack added.)ENVIRONMENT: Pretty neat. Animals. People. Cannot be touched but still a nice additon (That's Ubisoft Reflections for you there --> Driver:SF). The Map is huge and even after 40 hours of normal play time you wont even have it explored half-way. Environment is a huge plus here. Very good. 7.8/10 because there's too much undetailed water. (March 2015: Water updated, better reflections, realistic depth effects and more natural colours.) Yes, I am seriously criticizing water. It looked horrible back then, believe me.TUNING: Well, yes. Better than Rivals. Not as good as Underground 2. It's not bad compared to other recent racing games and you can tune your car just enough to be ""individual"". Severe Lack of stickers. (March 2015: This game is OVERFLOWING with a giant variation of stickers!)AI AND POLICE: THE RUBBERBANDING IS REAL. Ivory Tower SERIOUSLY managed to make a rubberbanding system 1299 times WORSE than EA. It doesn't matter if it's a Crown Vic, F-150 or Corvette. Cop cars have astonishing speeds of up to 250mph (400kmh), weigh about 30 metric tons and can seemingly drive through traffic, other cop cars, YOU if they want to, and can make objects in their way such as fences merely DISINTEGRATE. Also, if you're too far away, they just fly to you. Really neat. It's impossible to outrun a bunch of Lexus Sedans with a high-end Ford GT. The cops either keep up with you for 20 minutes straight or magically stop chasing you after 10 seconds. Sometimes they jump. Sometimes they fall through the ground. But most importantly, a CROWN VICTORIA can just BRAKE and STOP in front of a HUMMER H1 WITHOUT TAKING DAMAGE AND SUCCESSFULLY STOPPING THE 4 TONS HUMMER H1 IN UNDER A SECOND. Oh, and the cops bust you in like 3 seconds. Also: If you're under 30mph, you've got next to no chance of escaping the cops. (March 2015: weight-Issue corrected! Police cars weigh about 1.5 tons as they should and you are able to escape them too, pursuits are A LOT more fun now. 3-second-bust not changed. Disintegration and teleporting still exists too.)IN-GAME-MONEY: Not enough. There's just not enough. Everything is overpriced, the game is almost dragging you towards its microtransactions. 40000 Crew Credits for 6$. You're not even able to buy a car with these 6$. 40000 is nothing. You can buy 4 good vinyls with that. Stickers.ALMOST. THEY ALMOST HAD IT. IT WAS OKAY FOR LIKE A MONTH AND NOW THEY CUT THE FACTION REWARDS BY FRIENDS IN HALF. RIDICULOUS.April 2015: YOU GET EVEN LESS NOW! WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥!CONNECTIVITY: As I mentioned before, terrible. NAT-based. Lag Simulator 2014. There's a pretty high chance you can not play with anyone outside of your region, depending on your NAT-type.SERVERS: UbisoftGRAPHICS: Pretty good...? Textures not too great, and I'm not talking about the world. Your characters jacket looks like it's from Just Cause 2. No mirror reflections in first person mode. Alternate graphics in first person mode, increasing SSAO. Might cause frame drop on older graphics cards. Framerate absolutely awful compared to other games. Distant textures --> Assassins Creed: Unity. Texture filtering? Not really.This game is still unfinished. IGNs 6/10 is completely justified.Polygons 4.5/10 is still justified.My rating below based on my listed points in this review:MMO-Aspects: 4/10Cars: 6/10Environment: 9/10Tuning: 6/10AI and Police: 2/10Online Features: 3/10Graphics: 6/10Overall: 5.1/10  (This was the initial release score I gave The Crew)6.2/10 (Early March 2015)5.4/10 (Early April 2015)As you can see, the score didn't really improve much over time.This game is in the Top 3 Worst Releases Of 2014 in my opinion.They are all Ubisoft. How depressing.And yes, I'm kind of still playing it after writing this (negative) review. They continue to add more content (that should've been here by release but whatever) so that kinda keeps it going. Will edit each month or so.I LIED. I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THIS ANYMORE.

												Well, that was The Crew...After about 42 Hours ive seen the most things, beat the Campain and most of the Challenges.I bought ""The Crew"" with Hope for a Game that would be as entertaining as ""Test Drive Unlimited 2"".If you played that before, you will notice the similarity, many parts of TDU2 are also in The Crew. Sounds good right? No, not at all.Short Pro+Contra List on bottom of the Review What they both have in common is for example that the Police Cars are either always faster than you, regardless if you drive 100 km/h or 300 km/h or give up after 100 meters for no reason at all... Also the AI and Catch-Up-Systems during Races are equally bad. Other than that,Test Drive Unlimited 2 had probably over 130 different Vehicles, from many different Brands The Crew has maybe 40? (Until Ubisoft will add more DLC Cars for extra $$$)In Test Drive Unlimited 2 you had 1 small and one big Island as Gaming Worlds, Ibiza and Hawaii. The Crew offers 1 Map, a minature version of the United States.When the Servers at Test Drive Unlimited 2 are down, you can keep playing your Savegame in Offline Mode.  When the Crew Servers are down, you cant even Launch the Game.Test Drive Unlimited 2 offered a lot of things to do, you were able to go to a Driving School before races, to make Racing Licenses, to buy Houses, Cars, Bikes,Furniture for your Houses, you were able to customize your Avatar with clothes, Haircuts, Makeup, Accessoires. Also there were more design options for the Cars as well.It was possible to go to go into the Houses, walk around, similar to ""The Sims"". You could visit other Players homes, take Photos, there even was a Casino where you could play Blackjack, Poker, Slotmachines with other Players... and a few other things. The Crew doesnt offer much, dull and short Story Races, there are nice Cutscenes, but the Story itself is rather dumb.  There are also PVP events where the fastest Car always wins, nevermind how bad the Driver is..., Fraction Missions, Skillchallenges, Sightseeing and not really many customization options. BUT: At least you will have fun here, when youre able to drive around the Map with a Friend!While i played The Crew, i often asked myself how awesome the Game could be, if it was also developed and published by Atari and Eden Games.Ubisoft delivered, as expect, another Game that feels unfinished, like they stopped the developing Process at the Late Alpha Stage and just published it to cash in, for next Years ""The Crew 2""?For example, you sit inside your Car, the Driving Mirror and Side Mirrors dont show anything, They are just grey. Same goes for the Racing Wheel Instruments. They were supposed to show Speed, Gear and RPM, but they also just show you a fantastic grey bitmap.Only a few Cars have an Animation for a Gearshifting Character. Inside most of the Cars, the Avartar just keeps his Hands on the Steering Wheel and the Gears shift magically.  There are probably a few more little annoyances, but those points are already unnecessaryI would expect that from an early 2005 Game, but not from a 2014 release.The Things i liked about The Crew,  were the incredibly detailed surroundings.You see NPC's walking around, like a beggar moving his belongings in a shopping cart, Prisoners knocking stones in front of a Prison, Planes and Helicopters flying around ... and many more realistic Daily Life Events.The Map is filled with Wild Animals, they move a bit strange, but are still a nice addition.Also the Animated Sky looks really nice. What else is left to say? Yeah. The Cars.While Test Drive Unlimited 2 had a very good balance and Car selection, The Crew's Cars are very unbalancedThe Crew got a bunch of overpowered and ugly (My opinion, yes.) American Muscle Cars. They look like they weight 5 tons, have the aerodynamic values of a Brick Row House, but got a surreal good handling and can easily outrun a Lamborghini.  Thats just plain dumb. Besides that, there are a handfull european and asian Cars. But yeah they are the minority in this Game. The Handling of the Cars alltogether is good, mostly. The Handling of the Offroad Vehicles can be very frustrating.For sure this wont be any fun playing with Keyboard and Mouse. Pro and Contra for the Lazy People: + Very detailed environment (Working NPC's, a lot of Wilflife,,...)+ Better Graphics than Test Drive Unlimited 2+ Detailed Leaderboards and Statistics for everything+ Good Car handling and controls, with a few exceptions. + Open World, you can drive wherever you want~ Servers are down for Maintenance regulary, and when they work, it can happen that you still dont see any other Players.- - Uplay Launcher- Sometimes the ""Play with Friends"" Option works, other times it doesnt work at all. - No Offline Mode- Rather small Fleet of Cars- Unrealistic Engine Sounds- Missing Animations for Cockpit Mirrors. in some Cars also for Gear switching and Steering Wheel Speedometer, non funtional Indicators- No possibility to add your own Music- Boring and monotonous Storymode, Races are too short.- Not many Customization Options- The Crew was announced as a ""Car MMO"", but there are only up to 8 People in one Session.- No changing weather conditions (Except of Snow in the Mountains.)- Microtransactions- The Cars look great, but some of the textures of trees,bushes,... and the water look rather bad.All together i would say, ""The Crew"" has nice looking Cars, but it isnt the big next Generation Racing Game that was announced and promised.Its good for cruising around with Friends (If youre lucky enough to get a connection..) , to find out a few things about the United States, but in the Main Category ""RACING"" it lacks a lot.  You can pick it up when its on sale for 20 Bucks, its not a completly bad Game but i can not recommend it for the full Price.  ",2173,812,89,258,286,22,368

Alright, here we go... Take your time reading this. If you are still confused whether to buy this game or not, go ahead and start reading. ""TL; DR"" may occur. Scroll down to the ""Verdict"" and “Pro & Con” to see my final words.This game is still reasonably okay, what's with everyone? Let me explain why this CAN be a fun game:What they have been expecting was this game to be as super as it was marketed; like those people that claim that have never heard of hype-trains before. But the core element of the game is enough. This game has a bunch of minor flaws that e.g.: Microtransactions, and deceptive speed perception.I can satisfyingly say that as a sim racer (mostly playing Assetto Corsa, GSCE, rFactor, Project Cars, etc.) this game is a decent arcade racer that allows me to use my G27 wheel with good FFB (for an arcade game) in a cockpit camera (yes, the driver is only turning 180° of the steering wheel, but you can use your full 900°; just like in DiRT Rally). 'Been playing this game co-op with a friend, driving for 8 hours STRAIGHT through the U.S. Of A. and we are still not done with discovering, not even at the slightest. AND, bugs are mostly gone... (or reported ones I have not encountered, yet).What I have been determined to do was:-- driving to explore, -- to have fun with friends escaping the police, -- and driving a few races here and there; Let me tell you... it is good at that.What? ... You expected this game to be an ultra realistic driving game with an open world just because you read ""simulation"" in the tags on the store page? -- Yeah, with expectations like these you are wrong here, entirely. Yes, cars may drive sluggish with a gamepad, but I cannot confirm that entirely. It might have been the assists, an older version, or their own gamepad (again, I don't use a gamepad, I stick to a wheel). BUT, what I can confirm is that driving fast seems to be visually slow (for me only when I drive with the rear camera views). Although, that feeling stops when I change the view to the hood or cockpit camera. Don't think I'm trying to command you to now play the game in cockpit view (because that is personal perspective), but to try it out at least, or accept that the game's visuals are deceptive. You may compare this game with Test Drive Unlimited 2,I can already hear that you are screaming out loud that TDU 2 was a good. Sure, these two games are extremely similar:A galore of land to explore (it is not 100% accurate to the USA, but WTF, the game is still HUGE),Multiplayer that had you roaming with others,or even competing in challenges with 'em,it allowed customisation of your car,cop chases,Don't compare this to Project Cars (or any other try-hard sim-cade/sim) for example...-- This game just lacks the physics,-- Project Cars has the sole purpose of organised racing (the game is not about street racing, ramming, and cop chases),-- and a career that has no background whatsoever. Do you smell something fishy here? I do, let me tell you:The game is not a ""10/10 best game ever"", but this is a decent game, it has potential that it builds upon. People have to distinguish between this and the ""hyped-up version of this game (the one on E3). Yes, Ubisoft has failed at that part; miserably. Bragging with their ""revolutionary new MMO racer"", though, in the end it just being ""vanilla"" -- but a good one at that! The game also had huge bad mouthing due to the epic-failing AC Unity and WATCHDOGS.Adding microtransactions to your game whilst being an AAA is never a good idea, I agree. But the thing is (unless it is a car you really want) you can buy it for about 2 bucks, it is not that much. You are also given 100.000 CP (Premium currency) at level ten to buy yourself a bunch of cars (three at least). There are not that many cars to buy when it comes to cars that have to be bought with real money. With the ""Wild Run Expansion"" that is to add even more content (Drift cars, Dragsters, and Monster Trucks) there is actually something to enjoy again soon, this may also incentivise portions of the community as well.Graphics are looking well, the game runs at Ultra settings with 60 FPS (R9 270x Sapphire and i5-3470 @3.20GHz multi-core); only Anti-Aliasing is reduced to FXAA. The sounds of the cars are just as good as they were in TDU 2, might even compare them to DiRT Rally. The Crew should be regarded as a successor to the TDU series, for Atari has faded away due to bankruptcy.Okay, now let’s talk pro and con:Pro:-- The Crew offers a huge map to explore -- Cop chases-- The body of a car is highly customisable-- Each car has a number of different setups e.g. “Performance”, “Dirt” or “Street”-- Easy to acquire performance parts [a lot of them]-- Grinding is almost non-existent (just play the game; you’ll see)-- A demo that allows you full access for two hours-- The faction system keeps you busy after the story-- Amazing sound for an arcade-racer-- Much longevity to it if you are into the aforementioned activities-- Good graphics -- (The Wild Run Expansion will feature a complete graphics overhaul)-- Fun cruising with friends-- AI is of little focus; the focus only lies in the cops-- Finding new playersCon:-- The speed indicated seems to be exaggerated (for most people)-- Physics (mostly when falling from a cliff) are way too sluggish and heavy-- Visual tuning is limited e.g. colours, vinyls.-- You can only select from a pattern of vinyls, not individualise-- Gamepad controls/Keyboard controls have been reported being “icey” and “skatey”-- AI is just… “meh”, it sometimes speedhacks just like in MW, Carbon, etc.-- AI is of little focus; MMO.-- Finding new playersVerdict:So, again, if you look for a challenge against AI (like Need For Speed MW, Carbon, Underground), a fantastic story and crews around everyone that battles each other in The Crew this game is not for you. But there is still a thriving PVP mode, an amazing Faction system that keeps you playing after the Story. You will struggle with the AI being just bad at driving and sometimes pushing you off drastically. But if you are looking into a long (sadly cliche) story with nice coop missions, have interest in cop chases, driving about with friends, competing against your friend, aka. ""roaming in a racer"" You should ONLY get this game on sale, don't pay 60$, it is not as good. This game has just been marketed falsely… But c’mon, how many games offer a demo such as great as this one to showcase its potential? Get the demo and judge it for yourselves.			",97,7,23,6,16,0,14

												The Crew is an alright game, if you are into racing + mmos. The only problem I'm concerned about, reading on internet, is that microtransactions WILL be available later in the game (the CC currency). As far as I know, there's a huge difference between the bronze and golden part, and if you will be able to purchase all the golden parts with real money, there WILL be a huge difference between those who do not pay and those who do.I'd really ask ubi$oft to make the microtransactions available ONLY for COSMETICS, just like on all other games on interwebz (Dota 2, League of Legends, Team Fortress 2 [HATS!], and so on. I'm pretty sure you will gain a lot from those cosmetics (people won't mind if you add a 30$ cosmetic item that will have ""unusual"" effects, such as leaving some kind of light trail, etc) and players won't actually hate you because you released such a nice game but ♥♥♥♥ed it up in the end with P2W system. Edit 1: I'm not sure if there's anything else to be done after you hit the level 10 cap. Any other missions you complete will give you bucks BUT not xp. Also the parts you unlock are for level 15+, so I find it kinda useless (for now). Does anyone agree, at least in the next closed beta, to raise the level cap to 20? It takes about 2 hours to complete all the story quests and get to level 10.If you want to actually do something to earn you stuff, try find all the 20 parts of certain cars that will unlock you some really awesome vehicles, with good stats too as well.tl;dr: play game 10/10, ubi$oft plz no microtransactions on performance parts, raise level cap 20, ty.Edit 2: I made a poll about microtransactions, please vote: http://strawpoll.me/2428839 ",221,34,9,25,37,3,29

 do NOT purchase, even on sale!	  Pros	  Fun at times Graphics are nice Cons	  Horrible physics ""Rubberbanding"" AI (just like you'd find in a cart racer) Low amounts of customization Low amount of vehicles Virtually NO performance options available except for the ones you unlock from races. Horrible main stream music with no variety. It is NOT a simulator as it is tagged. it is NOT a MMO.(about 10 people per session does not make it an MMO) The little multiplayer they have is badly done. The story, while decent, is a massive heap of plot holes, just forget about them it makes it better. Roads are made of what seems like ice. the speed indicated seems like its way faster than the speed you seem to be going. Wants to show me random pointless cutscenes every 30 seconds. Cities are not ever close to accuratly represented to scale or appearance. Free roam would be nice, except its useless. you are forced to enter the map to start missions anyway. Micro transactions for in-game currency, are you kidding me? On a $60 game!?The physics are just wrong. tap an electrical pole and it just pops out of the ground and goes soaring through the air. seriously.The rubberbanding is absolutly horrible, I gained the lead by a huge amount and out of nowhere the other cars top speed raises by at least double letting them catch up in no time at all. Meanwhile if i hit one thing, just one, be it trash can or fence, I have offically lost the race because I cannot keep up.The only way it seems to get performance parts is to win races. So win them all with gold or you wont be able to move on.Huge story plot hole #1 --- Man puts hit on you, Go looking for guys friends to beat them in a race. Why wouldn't they just shoot you..?

												After the FORCED 5.9gb wildrun update, game is unplayable. They locked the controls customization and they expect every player out there to play with the d,i,l,d,o controls they have assigned. .. nope, i can't do that. I've been playing for over 10 years with the layout I like to use, it's like telling Formula 1 pilot to jump into another F1 that is not setup for him ... uncomfy seat, pedals in wrong place ...etc.Just not happening, I'm no longer playing or supporting this game. Something as small as locking the controls can destroy the game. GG ubisoft ... as expected they don't have much brain nowdays. Why would you even include ""controls customization"" if you can't customize? I mean some stuff works, but some stuff is locked, the locked part is VITAL to me and it cannot be changed, very bad. Useless game, hope they go bankrupt.Also new update made grass look like out of a cartoon. Speaking of online, it's very bugged. When trying to play with friends, it keeps disconnecting and friends keep disappearing on map, you see their name, but not the car or they disappear completely and then it complains that ""can't join session"" or some other bs like that.On top of all that, at some point entire coop and PvP was unavailable and Ubisoft was blaming steam servers for this, how can it be STEAM servers, if this is a 3rd party game? It doesn't even run on steam, you can purchase and download via steam, but servers are hosted by Ubisoft. Ubisoft is very bad and untrustable company, they lie and deceive and scam.They show you one thing, but release something completely different.Also savegame is 100% server sided, If it corrupts (which it does sometimes), then only way to fix this, is to contact ubisoft support and it takes them 1-3 months to reply to tickets. I was literally stuck for 3 months, because my savegame was stuck on loading and their support took 3 months to reply (not over reacting, literally 3 months).Concept is nice, map is huge, but entire game is very badly executed and nearly no support, Ubisoft is money greedy company and all they care about is money, they don't care about gaming experience. I don't recommend this to real gamers, it might look like a cool game, but after bit of playing it gets' very irritating and frustrating to deal with bad support and all those bugs and glitches.

I was escaping the police pursuit. Suddenly one of police cars started to ram me (on speedhack of course) and when he touched my car we both started to fly reeeeeally high. I landed in the middle of the forest & the police car landed 2 meters near me. He blocked my way out (well, I couldn't move either because I had Street spec car), arrested me and then the lady in the police radio said '5+, very good work'. Yes! Very good work Ubisoft. Welcome to The Crew.Pros:- You know... big, open world, where you can do anything,- There are some really nice places to visit,Cons:- U(don't)Play - yes, I know it's nice to do the actions, achievements, etc. in this, but this app extends game launching from 5 seconds to 1 minute,- CREW CREDITS - yes, this game has microtransactions,- Low amount of cars,- HUGE RACING MMO with up to 8 players in one session,- The game story is so boring that I already forgot the main characters name,- Physics is so bad that I can't understand why one of the minigames is flying the car as far as possible - it shows all the bugs,- Police cars IQ is very disappointing - all they can do is ramming. Who needs keeping civilians safe when you can just hit players car to crash in 10 cars / 5 persons on the sidewalk?- I couldn't find anyone to play Fraction Missions 2 months after release. LoL- Cars after tuning are very ugly (for me doesn't mean for everyone),- Several times I couldn't accept invite to coop from other players,- I don't know what are roads in this game made of, but it doesn't look like asphalt,_________________________________________Don't buy it for 50€. Please don't do this.			",239,53,12,27,13,7,21

												For the most part I can IGNORE the BAD BAD BAD AWFUL AFWUL cop chases, car customization and stuff but I bought this game for my friend HOPING that we can play together. Never ever had it crossed my mind that my friend and I CAN'T PLAY TOGETHER this so called MMO. Pure crap! And the 50 euro price tag is a cruel joke. I can't begin to say how sorry I am to have payed for this game.			",10,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beta tested Aug. 25 to Aug 29. I am going to get this out of the way first, yes this game looks and feels a lot like Need for Speed's Underground and Most Wanted series. For me that is the best possible thing, because I loved those games and I am not a fan of where that franchise is at the moment. Story - The story will immediately bring you back to the NFS stories. While it isn't the most original, it fits what the game is. the cinematics don't look bad, but the cut scenes after almost everything you do can be a little annoying. You can skip them though, which is of course a good thing.  The driving mechanics are more arcade style, but it still has a realistic feel to it for those who like that. I like to switch between over the top and in the car camera, and I will say they did a good job with the in the car detail.The controls are great, even with a keyboard and mouse if you're a fan of that mode. From what I have seen both controller and wheel work great with this game. Personally I prefer controller, but might be looking to get into a wheel if I find myself playing it a lot. The world. It took me 14 minutes to get from Chicago to New York City. That is a long time considering I was driving around 140 the entire time. The world is huge, I am a little upset that they didn't even think my homestate of Connecticut was important enough to put on the map, but hey I can forgive them. During the beta I ran into many players and was invited to their crews as well.Missions. The most fun mission that I took part in was I believe called a Raid. Myself and two other players had to chase down an NPC and take them out. We were in our street cars and the target was in a raid vehicle. Even with strangers this was fun, so I know it will be a lot of fun with friends. The regular races are fun and challenging, the maps are of a nice design, but if you are someone who doesn't like racing with traffic around, you may want to only race when it is an evening time. Yes, the population follows the time, if it is afternoon or rush hour there will be tons of traffic, if it's night time there will be almost none. I crashed a lot and I feel like I am a good driver in these types of games, trying to avoid crashing is part of the fun though of course. Other players - For the most part the other players that I ran into were pretty cool. However you always have to beware of those players who are only out to troll you. They will just ram you for no reason and stuff like that. One thing I liked about the game was that it announces who the most wanted player online is. I'm not sure how the servers work for the game, but it's a nice feature to see and maybe even strive for. Customization - Since it is still beta there wasn't much customization. There were maybe 5-10 choices for visualization except for right and left fenders, also not sure about stickers since I didn't use them. The choices that were there were nice and shows that we have some cool options coming in the future. There were no performance options yet, but you gain some from completing missions that give bonuses and increase your car level. All in all I think the game looks and feels very promising. With Need for Speed going into the more Realistic/Exotic car with no customization field, this game looks to take its place. The game to me feels like it will be a lot more fun with friends, but can still hold it's own solo or with friends you meet through the game itself. I definitely recommend this game. I hope you enjoy it and I hope to see you on the track.In its current state and with the promise of all the additions that will be available at release I will give the game a 7/10 for now. Once the game releases I am sure that will go to between 8-9 in the racing genre.I am seeing a lot of complaining about the length of the beta. You don't have to pre-purchase. You made the choice to do it, so try to keep complaining to a minimum. Second, there is a way to change the 30FPS problem, you just have to do a bit of research. I didn't do it myself but a streamer that I was watching did, and some in his chat also. Now onto the review.			",88,21,3,10,24,0,11

 If you get TL;DR syndrome then skip down to ""Verdict of The Crew"" but I encourage you to read the specifics so that you can accurately judge if this game is right for you.  First Rule of The Crew:      - Do  NOT  buy this game unless you have a human companion to play it with! As many others have probably stated, hardly anybody plays this game online; the servers are ghost towns. The players that are online in this game, based on their driving style, are probably around 10-13 years of age (offense only mildly intended if you are of that age range). It is not uncommon for an online driver to see your car and immediately attempt a T-bone maneuver. Therefore, if you are seriously considering purchasing this game, make absolutely sure that you have a friend to play with online so that this game can begin to live up to the expectations we all had of it. Premise of The Crew:      - The Crew was designed to be an MMORG (Massively Multiplayer Online Racing Game), which in concept is absolutely brilliant! In execution, however, The Crew has fallen short due to empty servers and a bug-laden open world. It cannot be denied that the premise of this game is one of the best of all time, but it seems that the makers of The Crew lacked the man-power in their programming teams to make this work well. Accolades of The Crew:      - The Crew is one of the most fun games I have ever played! My friend and I would meet online regularly to do missions together, rank up our cars together, take on challenges together and our favorite - drive in the open world together. In terms of sheer enjoyment for a racing video game, The Crew has to make the Top 5! (...when it's working...)     - The Crew has a  massive  open world map! The map is probably about a 20:1 scale map of the United States; the map is by no means cartographically accurate, but the major landmarks and cities are there. Everything is down in scale (similar to Midnight Club: LA or the GTA games), but that doesn't mean that the world doesn't feel humongous! It is a daunting task to think about driving from Miami to Seattle, or LA to Niagara Falls, but as one who has done it, there are few things more exciting! There are many little easter eggs on the map to find in addition to the hidden objects and challenges that make simply driving around in the open world interesting and fun.      - The Crew has a fairly large list of cars that are available in the game and all of the cars available look great in the game. You can customize your car with different body sets, colors and stickers to make your vehicle one of a kind. The cars also handle pretty well all things considered; The Crew is definitely not a simulator when it comes to driving but for an arcade style racer the car handling is more realistic than it could have been. It should be said that by the time you beat the game and level up your first car to Level 50 parts and a 1200+ rating, however, you  will  have a favorite car or two and for the most part only drive those cars.     - The Crew has pretty decent graphics too. I have found myself taking screenshots of the scenery, much like I do with Skyrim, because the world really does look great! Of course, the world looks better at 60-80mph than it does at 180-200mph, even with the best GPUs, but that's to be expected.  Complications with The Crew:      - This game is buggy. There is no simpler way to say it. And there is no denying it. My friend and I have constantly been thwarted by programming issues within the game. During open world travels we will inevitably come across at least a major bug or two every 30-60 mins. Some of the worst, especially since the new expansion has come out, include (1) infinite loading screens, (2) game freezing during fast travel, and my personal nemesis - (3) the road/world disappearing in front of you [this bug has an relatively easy fix - just open up the map and quickly exit out again, but it is annoying nonetheless. It is also potentially game breaking when you are in a mission or co-op event when the open world map is not accessible.] There is no way to enjoy The Crew without experiencing bugs. Maybe if there were more people online the makers of The Crew would be inclined to fix them, but since there are not, you just have to deal with them. This creates a Love/Hate relationship with this game.     - The AI in this game is... wonky, to say the least. For missions/co-op events or in police chases, the AI seems counter-productive (as opposed to challenging) and even vengeful at times. Rubberbanding  definitely  occurs in these types of events and should be expected (heck, sometimes I think they designed it that way just so that you  NEED  a crew playing with you). In the open world, expect AI driven cars to suddenly swerve in front of you, especially if you are going 200+mph. If there were any corners cut in the programming of this game, I would think that they were cut in this AI department.     - If you do end up convincing a friend to buy this game with you so that you can play it together, then you should also know that forming a crew in the game can be difficult at times too. It is normal for my friend and I to spend 15-30 mins trying to get into a crew together and forcing the game to put us on the same server. Game restarts should be expected, and it should also be noted that The Crew doesn't always play nice with Steam's voice chat (probably because it's a Ubisoft game and uses UPlay. **As a side note though, I have not had as many issues with Uplay as I have had with other games they put out**). Tips for The Crew:      - Many others have said it on forums and discussion boards, but this game  NEEDS  a multiple waypoint system. The gigantic map is just begging for one! It is very frustrating to try and create driving routes and races with your crew/friend with only one waypoint to lay down. Honestly, I am very surprised by this huge oversight!     -  Along with that, this game would be vastly improved if there was a community based Player Created Races/Challenges feature. Since open world driving is the best (and most advertised) feature in the game, having a community of racers all creating their own races/routes/challenges would add content and excitement to the game. Verdict of The Crew:      - I have put over 80 hours into this game and about 70 of those hours have been genuinely enjoyable! Open world driving is by far my favorite activity and with the help of my friend I have come up with several fantastic driving routes that are always a blast to drive! There is no other game quite like The Crew and my heart wants everyone to buy and enjoy this game.      - The remaining 10 hours I have spent in this game, however, make it so that I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game for the $30/$40 listing price. Even on sale, if you  don't  have a friend to play this game with, I would  highly  recommend that you stay far, far away! But if you do have a friend to play with, I would want you to seriously consider the issues presented in this review and weigh them against your desire for this game:           (1) If there is any hesitation, then spend your money elsewhere.           (2) If there is still excitement and a ""devil-may-care"" attitude, then all I can say is, ""Good luck!""			",48,17,1,7,10,0,10

												It could have been such a wonderful game. The idea is solid, the map and community/social aspects are fantastic, but Ubi really screwed up some pretty major details. The car handling, as I'm sure you'll read in a thousand negative reviews, is terrible. 260 km/h feels like 100 km/h, rivals and NPC racers seem to rip around the track like they're on rails, and they have absolutely no problem pushing you out of the way while you struggle to change their course even slightly. The raid events are frustrating, as the vehicle seems to swap ends for what looks like no reason. Off road, every vehicle handles like butter on a hot skillet. It could have been good, but I think I'm going to turn my Xbone on and stay with Forza. Maybe Ubi should play Horizon 2 and take a page or three from it.			",117,5,2,26,5,0,2

												I don´t really understand why there are so many people complaning...The Map is huge, not a joke like the super-tiny NFS Maps who were always too small to have a real racing/car-game feeling.The graphics is quite good given the size of the map, even though it looks somewhat generic the most time. If you want a car-themed game with a lot of space to cruise around with real cars, this game is for you.The only real downsides I found were some pretty annoying missions in the main story.Yes, there isn´t much to do after reaching LVL 50 and completing the main story, but is this the only thing important?Cant say anything about PVP, never did it.Compared to some other Ubisoft Games in 2015/2016 this game is quite okay.

Do you know who are you working for ?-yes, Ubisoft.-Right, and what's our reputation ?-Being the best at screwing up good game concept and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off our customers ?-Exactly ! Now this game has many flaws but none of them are really frustrating-Indeed, that's why we created Uplay back then-Not enough son, not enough. I want the whole team in the crisis room in 5 minutes(gathering the team and explaining the situation)-Sir, I got an idea-Sure go ahead-Well why don't we force the player to connect to a main server ?-Many games do that, not really frustrating.-True, but we would require the player to be constantly connected-ooooh, that's good, I like it-And the main server would be super instable and people would be kicked from the game at anytime, loosing their progression !-Genius, I promote you president of Ubisoft.EDIT : You guys say it's a MMO ?Do you actually know what MMO stands for ? Just the first ""M"" ?You'll interact with 8 players max. at a time...holly molly, that's massive !Ubisoft used the term MMO for marketing purpose only,  there's isn't a single solid reason to prevent us from playing this game in SP.

												This game is basically ""how to not make a good racing game 101""1. Auto catch up2. AI is over tuned to try and make up for the players ability to use cars ""over the cap""   a) cops are unstopable all seeing terminators and getting away from this is more chore than skill   b) it literally ignores the in game physics   c) uses non spec (street,dirt, perf) cars perfectly in any situation Perf car on dirt? No problem, you however won't stop being sideways3. The game at points forces you to use sub par spec cars because ""story"" which are usually just time trials with an annoying npc yelling at you4. PvP is waiting in a queue to never getting into the game5. co-op is just two people suffering through a race and most the time even if someone pulls up next to you in the same race they'll just ignore the co-op request6. Overly expensive cars with arbitrary limitations on what can and cannot be certain specs7. Raid spec activities are just awful8. car spec designs are generic and the for purchase asthetics don't fix much9. If you do manage to find someone in co-op then the lag shows up pretty bad 10. world is flat and uniteresting until cars randomly pop in and you crashIf you're on the fence about buying this game don't do it. Just wait until GTA 5 comes out on PC and play GTA Online because it's superior in every way.			",205,38,4,26,18,7,27

												After around 40 hours of playing, I have completed the story, yet there is so much replayability since the map is amazing. But I will discuss what I think are the pros and cons and possible improvements of the game.Pros:- Loading Screens are replaced with cinematics and statistics/parts. Using an SSD, these load time seems very quick.- Huge World Size/Map, the large map with the amount of detail put in is incredible, each area feels representative and visually stunning. This by far is the best part of the game. You can even zoom right into the other side of the map, and see LIVE details. Even sitting on the opposite side of the world map.- AFK Cinematic, when AFK your screen goes into different camera angles around your vehicle, with the terrain and weather affecting it.- 5 Base Car specs, These being Street, Performance, Circuit, Dirt, and Raid. Each with their pros and cons. Myself I prefer Circuit and Performance. These specs determine where and how you drive. (Expansion adds Monster, Drift, Drag)- Day/Night Cycle. During the night, everything feels different, yet good. The night time scene can be as visually stunning as daytime.- Customization, the customization in parts, colours and stickers. Are very good. You can even customize your interior. This allows people to make their car look the way they like it for each spec.- Exploration, as there are so many places to go, plus the incentives like hidden car parts, and landmarks, it feels like you always have something to find. Plus you cannot FAST TRAVEL to places you haven't explored on the map.- Arcade-like, yet realistic. It is a fine line between the two, but The Crew seems to have found a nice balance. With destructible (yet respawnable) gameworld. Crashes are of course nowhere near as deadly, but damage to the car happens and is visible until repaired.- Factions, you can choose between 5 factions (eventually) each allowing you to represent them in faction races and events. Earn reputation and you can earn more in-game $$ too.- Coop/Friends - Playing with up to 4 friends is great, especially how every race/mission/skill has its own leaderboard. Competing against your friends score is a great incentive. - Price, I purchased The Crew whilst it was on Holiday Sale (50% off). so it felt very valued for the time spent. The retail cost seems fair, however. As there are at least 30 hours of missions. + Countless hours worth of skills/exploration/PVP/factions etc.- Public Transport, If you do not want to drive from New York to Discover Los Angeles (for example), you can take a train or airplane, as a sort of paid fast travel. But I recommend just driving.- Skills, along every route and dotted everywhere along the map, are skills. These are objectives to earn parts for your car and compete against your friend. Makes the trip more enjoyable when every 5-10 minutes you can do some weaving (Slalom) for some fun, and parts. (If you're good enough).- Police Chases, cause enough destruction around a surveyed area, and you get some police chasing after you. Get caught and pay a HEFTY fine. - Vehicle Stock. There are over 50 in-game purchasable cars, each able to be specced out in different ways, some being able to be specced in most areas.- Driver cam. Seeing the interior and the world as it would be, LOVE IT.Cons:- Cinematic Bugs, especially annoying since the cinematics are stunning. Having the audio completely drop out is really annoying. Even after replaying it at HQ, it still doesn't work. Having to replay the cinematic on youtube to hear it is not good. Also, a few times my car would flip over in the cinematic.- Locked to certain specs for races. I would like to compete against AI/friends using whatever car I want. But races will lock you to the SPEC. I think the route would balance what would be recommended vs what could be used.- Wild Run coaxing. Seems a bit pushy. Game starting screen, WILD RUN. Map spawn location. WILD RUN event. Certain skills (long jump etc) only achievable in drag car (WILD RUN). Want others to join you in missions (Look for crew) WILD RUN. I would like to see these features changed so that they less invasive, and more tempting rather than pushed you on. And for the price, Wild run is NOT worth it.- HQs / Tuners, most have the same background/area, some dingy commercial garage. Would like to see these being different and representative of the area.- Voice acting, it is not synced at all, and for some reason, they often call (Alex) 'kid'. Even if Alex is a middle-aged man. Pretty weird. - NO Cross Console compatibility. Cannot play with my console brethren.- PvP unbalanced. Vsing People 500pts above you. Lambo vs Mini Cooper.. Come on.- Perks should be removed completely, add the bonuses as standard when unlocking your allies.- 'Dumb' Smart Loot. Lvl 50 in a 600 pt car gets the highest score, better give him a bronze Lvl 25 part?? A lower score would have given me a better part.- Notifications on Old Parts. Seeing I have a new Lvl 25 bronze part for my platinum specced car when I visit the workshop is a bit annoying.Improvements:- Public Transport. Allowing the player to BOARD a train, or AIRPLANE, and visually see the map around them as they journey across.- Missions. Missions/Faction Races could be improved to be more rewarding. The 4hour race should have a way better reward then the 2.5hour race. A bigger REP or $$ Bonus would be nice. Also more of them. It is really simple to make them as the map is perfect. Just put a marker from A to B anywhere on the map.- Character Customization. Customization of 'Alex' would be great especially in the open multiplayer world. The Same change of clothes the whole game, does this guy even shower?- Music/Radio. More stations/music lists. It seems they are repeating quite frequently.- Test Drives. These should be like a normal test drive, drive wherever you want. Pay for damages. I do not like being limited to the small area (test lap) around the city the dealer is in. I would like to go to the track to be able to dry these cars out etc. There could be a % BOND of the Car Price that you have to pay before getting to drive it, and if you damage the car you end up paying for it later, like those A >  B missions that penalize car damage.- Car Specs. Having cars limited to 1 or 2 specs is not realistic. As most Perf cars could be Circuit cars and visa versa. Also, these should be visible to see what it would look like BEFORE purchasing.- Cross platform. Cross Console compatibility.- Removal of spec specific races. Or adding races that you can choose. Prefer the later option.- Random Vehicle Customization at DEALERS. Having it on purchased parts at the HQ is good, but being able to randomize what the car could look like at the tuner would be ideal.- Customization Lock options. Like the colour/shape (for example), should be able to lock those options.- AFK Cam, Toggleable On/Off and a smoother, slower shift in camera angles, over the Jumpy random camera angles. Also removal of the BLUR effect when in this mode.- Removal of 'Updating Content' loading. When alt-tabbing. Especially in borderless mode.- Controls. WASD STANDARD for speed etc. Who the hell uses arrow keys? Having everything on 1 side is easier. Lucky you can rebind them.- Scrapping Parts. Should be a lot more rewarding, and possible in the workshop.- Ragdoll effects on animals and people. If you hit them, you should probably see them go flying, instead of clipping through the car. A solid quick vibration would be a nice touch, for the real immersion.ConclusionAs usual, there are a lot of things that could be improved,.but I do highly recommend this game. Not only for racing, but for exploration.(If you found this review helpful, give it a thumbs up!) ",37,5,0,10,5,0,7

												Its 4 AM so take this review with a grain of salt.Summery:Not an MMO!Never more than 8 players per session!Micro-Tranactions!Cop chases are a jokeCop cars are tanks (compleately different physics than normal cars)Opponent AI is BADNot NEARLY the custemization that NFS games used to have in the 90's!!!UplayNon-existent tuningBinary progressionChat system is never usedRant:""6k people are currently playing The Crew"" and yet, I'm forced to play single player half the time. The way the pregression system is set up, people who have already compleated the missions you are working on have no reason to help because they have already unlocked the part that you earn for compleating the mission.Not to mention that those 6k people that are currently in game are devided up into 8 player lobby/sessions which means that you will almost NEVER run into another player unless you are going out of your way to do so.Currently the chat system isn't used by anyone, and so the game just feels like a giant single player game.I repeat, this game is NOT AN MMO, its a single player game that wants to be an MMO but doesn't know what its doing.The Crew also has annoying, easy to fix flows that you don't see in older games like NFS carbon.In its current state the game is unfinished and needs a lot of work.The one thing that really grinds my gears is that I bought the game for $60, and yet ubisoft wants me to spend more money on crew credits.Why is it that you pay $60 only to be met with micro-tranactions.Ubisoft, STOP IT!!!Edit: Alright, now that I've gotten some sleep, I should mention that the game is still a lot of fun, and compaired to other modern racing games that I've played this one is my favorite, it still has some things that need to be fixed, buts its fun never the less.Driving across the massive map is awesomeTook me 120 minutes to drive from one side to the otherCustemization is good compairitively speakingOnce you reach level 20+ drifting around corners is a blastI have high hopes for the game, and I hope that eventually we will be able to play with more people.in my opinion its not worth $60 at the moment, but if it goes on sale or gets a major update that might change.

												It is a decent racing game. Not worth the full price.Pros:- Big Map.- Nice story. (while it lasts)- Enjoyable cruising.- Nice Graphics.- Enjoyable enviroment.Cons:- Uplay forced (Blame Ubisoft).- Online Connection problems (Blame Ubisoft).- Quite short story.- Grinding required for the parts.Overall, worth having in library for driving fans. :)			",285,84,16,28,34,3,26

												Updated at 9/1/2015, Status update Appearently I have written too much, please click HERE[puu.sh] or HERE(doc)[puu.sh] for the full review There is a summary at the end if you are too busy to see through the whole review.And just a kindly reminder, there is no R-35 in the game yet.-------9/1/2015-------Patch released at 7th+ Car fix+ Better connection- No fix on AI- Faction War still meaningless- Still no rear mirror- Little more bugsBetter than before but not enough------------------------Hate to say it, but if you are not a big fan of a free-roam racing game, don't buy it at this momentAlthough I am not recommending this game, this doesn't mean I don't like this game, as you see I have thrown more than 100 hours in itThe Crew was a good game for people to driving around the states, it still is, but with tons of flaws atm.Still, I should start on the good things first as some of you may still interested in the game.At first, It has a biggest map for a racing game I ever saw, even I have spent more then 100 hours in the game, I still have about 1/4 to 1/5 of the map is undiscovered.If you only drive to explorer the map and not doing missions, it should take you at least 12 hours, as you can drive 3-4 hours in a starting car just driving a lap of the border.The game also provide various terrain and environment, with landmarks for players to enjoy and explorer freely.In some of the story mission, it will even provide some environment effect like fireworks or plane flying over your head which is quite stunning when you see it first time.There are 5 specs for cars: Street, Dirt, Perf, Raid, CircuitFor Street, Dirt and Perf, there are parts to let you to customize the cars, like front bumper, hood, rear wing, etc.Just be aware not all the car has all 5 spec.The interior of the cars are quite detail and you are able to customize the color of it in most of the cars.There are also different activity like skill challenge or limited period mission that may keep you playing.Bad thingsFirst of all, lack of cars, there are only 40+5(wreck) cars if you are not buying the season pass, also, there are no Audi, Toyota, Subaru, Mitsubishi, Honda, Hyundai, Vovle and more.And for each brands there are only 1-2 cars.The handling are not realistic like GT series, it is acceptable but you may feel strange for the first few hours.The things that can be driving through are also uncertain, you can drive through some fences in cities, and bounce off with others.There are no technical tuning in this game, like suspension modification, angle of tires, etc.The only thing you get is upgrading the equipment directly.There is no rear mirror view when you are in interior modeThe mechanism of automatic transmission is flawed (Details in Full review)The difficulty of this game is very hard in different aspect and it is not adjustable.First, the Rival AI's car can be insanely fast, they will not slow down by environment unless crash.For some casual driver with the staring cars, it is very hard for them to catch up.And with the auto catch-up system, even if you are good at driving and lead the whole race, you make one mistake and you will be overtake then lose.You can invite other players to the mission to try to decrease the difficultyBut the problem is you will need to wait for the game to connect to a random session before you can invite players you don't knowAnd with a maximum 8 people session, there is very hard to find one who actually willing to play with youAbout the police chase, first, the police is as fast as rival AI's car in missions.They have a circle radar around them instead of a cone vision which should be able to block by buildingsThe police heli can see through the tunnelsMost ridiculously is that if you go too far from the police cars, the police car can spawn anywhere near you, and sometime in front of youThis make you need to maintain an approximate distance that their radar cannot catch you but no police car will spawnTo escape it should be always as fast as possible, I don't know why they need to make this system so counterintuitiveThere is some perk in the game which can actually increase the handling, acceleration, speed, etc. in the gameWhich mean even with a same car, a LV50 player still have a big advantage compare to a LV1 player, if the LV1 player haven’t bought any perk points using credit which can be obtain by paying real money.Car level nearly mean everything, especially when doing story missions with others.With my 1200 lv cars, I always outrun the guy who invited me to the coop mission in his/her first time attempt.In my experience, the higher lv car you have, the higher position you will get in PVP.And to get a car over 1000lv, you will first have to reach 50 lv at your characterWhich mean you will have a big disadvantage before you reach 50 lvIn this game there is a faction war system but meaninglessThe stability of the session can be very unstableWhen you are in a crew, you select a mission and invite you crewmate, you can end up with your crew member playing the mission themselves and you get a forever loading screenSimilar things happen when you select public PVP lobby, you will be the only one who get into the lobby and your crewmate will continue finding a lobby.Sometimes you crew member will not appear in your screen even when you are beside of him/her.PVP sessions also contain connection problemsSometimes when other player in your session have a unstable connection, the game will pause for 5 secondswhen the player have a really bad connection, you game can have more than 10 times pauses, which is extremely annoyingsometimes you can also getting left behind at the starting line when people already racing in front of you with about a hundred yards awayThis is a nice racing game, and for some people it is still a masterpiecebut it is also nearly the worst racing online game ever, don't even know why they make the MMO feature as a selling pointThe slogan of this game is ""Never Drive Alone"", but for me it is like ""Never Drive Alone If You Want To Suffer""SummaryProsHuge map for explorationMany customization for some cars in some specDetail and customizable interiorBeautiful and various environmentEnvironment effects in story missionsDifferent activities that keep you playingConsLack of carsNo technical tuningHandling/Physics are not realisticFlaws in automatic transmissionNo rear mirrorDifficulty is overall high and not adjustableAI cars will not slow down by environmentMaximum 8 people session make players hard to crew upPolice chasing system is stupid and annoyingPerk system can provide unbalanced advantagesLV of cars nearly mean everythingFaction War system is totally unfairForced online with the server is unstableGame statistics can be messed up by the game/serverUnstable connection among friends/crew member and to the sessionsPVP connection problemBad avatar systemVarious BugsMixedToo much uncertainty on the roadRecommend to buy it if youLove free rome style racing gameHave friends to play together and can tolerate to any possible fail from the serverLove customize your cars and show offNot Recommend to buy it if youCares more about realism of racingAre a casual driver and consider this game as a single player racing gameDon't want to use tons of times to climb the ladder

												Where to start ? ... I gave my hope away on this game, I was expecting so much and it disapointed me.Such a great map, good graphics and simcade driving, was everything I was looking for, to play with some friends, I was hoping with the updates they would fix the majority of bugs, and add some new stuff to the game, but no.So far I think they released the beta version on the game, sometimes I even think the beta had less bugs then now, lol .. Pros :- Great map, it's really awesome;- Graphics are good;- Cockpit view, the interiors are well designed;- Simcade driving is fun;- Many specs ( Street, Dirt, Performance, Raid and Circuit ).Cons:- Lack of cars, only 47 fullstock cars (if I'm not wrong.);- Exterior car custimization is just poor:      - 200 rims ? And you get like the same rim with 3/5 different colors.       - The bumpers, some of them the only thing that changes is the headlights.      - Stickers, pre-made stickers that you can't even change the color of them;- The MMO , ... when you launch the game you can see like 100 people on the same server as you, but while you are on free-roam you can see up to 8 people. That's like driving offline, with an option to PVP that will take you to a lobby with 4~8 people to race against.- Cockpit view:      - When PVPing if there's no collison , the other player will just pass by your car and you won't be able to see nothing in from of you, only a black shade of your oponent.      - In cockpit view your mirrors don't work;- AI , the AI is just impossible, if you are being chased by the police it's really hard to escape. You can go 400 km/h with a Circuit SLS on an Highway that a Ford Crown Victoria will chase you down. - Some of the game physics are just out of this world:       - You get rammed by another player or a AI car your car just fly's away, you try to ram a cop you get stucked.       - You hit a fence or a pile of garbage on the sidewalk you lose like 10/20 km/h;- PVPing, sometimes you need to wait 5 minutes to join a lobby to get rammed mostly.- In PVP the lobby leader (the player with most wins) is the one who dictates wich track you are going to play and the settings, with or without traffic/collision, instead of being choosen by a vote among the lobby players.(...)And there's the Crew Credits, that for me it's neutral, in my point of view they are there to help people that lack of time to ""farm"" money to buy a car that they like, or parts of it, for people that buy the game to play 3/5hours a week.Because you can easily make money doing pvp races (15~18k bucks each race and with perks the most expensive car is like 708k), you can buy all the cars and parts without having to buy the CC's.Should you buy the game?Yes/No.- Yes, if you are into this type of games, but buy it heavly discounted.- No, if you buying it full price, because for the price that they are asking for it they should give players way more stuff and not this. To me this was the most expensive ""early-acess"" that I've ever bought.			",17,0,2,1,2,0,1

												For a game advertise as an ""MMO"" for cars it's quite sad that you have only a limited number of person by instance (something around 8 person).The car choice is nice, if you like muscle car and exotic. But there is also a serious lack of diversity (2 asian car, that is really not much). We should have iconic car that was used in rally racing, audi quattro, mitsubishi evo (at least one), a subaru STI (at least one also), the first mini, toyota celica. Also we are missing nice super/hyper japanese car (no nissan GTR R35 really ?, no Lexus LFA)The car customisation is quite poor also, we have a lot of choice for the starter car but not so much for the rest of it. The driving experience is cool though driving through the whole united states with friends is quite nice.I would still recommend this game, but not at this price.  ",48,3,1,4,2,0,1

												While I have had an amazing time playing this game, I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone.  Ubisoft support is lacking on a good day, downright rude and dismissive on bad.  At the time I write this, I'm 9 days late recieving a Crew-Credit pack, while their store is still up selling them.Also world records on every skill challenge/mission is held by hackers, so there's no recognition for actually doing well.

												Remember all those people that keep saying the latest racing games are awful and they're no match to titles like Need For Speed Underground, Need For Speed Most Wanted, Juiced, Midnight Club, well...this game is trying to be that and people still ♥♥♥♥ all over it.Ivory Tower, the developers of the game, are listening to the suggestions the community offers and rant about, but no, Ubisoft are the publishers of this game therefore it's crap.And for the people that only care about the graphics, ♥♥♥♥ your graphics.It's really sad to see so many negative reviews for a game that is actually trying to match the quality of the early 2000s' racing games.The developers of this game are actually trying, so instead of shiting all over they're game, maybe you should give them some constructive feedback			",103,13,11,7,17,0,4

												So, Ivory Tower. A good studio. Exept, they are managed by Ubisoft, and that means problems. I have the season pass for The Crew, and it did not come with Wild Run (£14.99) or the newest DLC Calling All Units (£19.99). Now, am I now entitled to take a poo on their doorstep? The season pass only comes with the DLC's that are much cheaper than these new ones. Also the previous large DLC which was Wild Run did not support all of the cars, and the reason for the game having a mostly negative review space is that the game studio is owned by Ubisoft, and Ubisoft have a known reputation for releasing DLC, sorry, WAY TOO MUCH DLC, for a game that feels incomplete without it. It feels as if the updates for this game have been payed for and added in a DLC form, now this game is actually quite a good one, exept for the overpriced nonsense.			",142,25,18,15,30,1,14

												Edit (2016) They have sold a ""complete edition"" when there is more content on the way, so you can pay once for the game with the season pass, pay again for the content that doesn't come in the season pass, then pay one more time for more content not included to be released. To hell with this game. Edit (4/25/2015) : They added a few new cars and some specs, fixed some bugs and managed to improve the main menu with a slideshow and the online matchmaking with a merge-all lobby system. Perhaps it's enough of a change for you to enjoy this game? Me, I checked and played the 'new' content for a few hours and unninstalled it again, personally I can't find any improvement worth a buyback into this game since my gripe is the terrible driving mechanics alongside the bad physics. I remain true to every word I wrote in this review. I had high hopes for this game, I played the betas, followed the forums and pre-ordered it. Then I forced myself to like it and play it even after I was completely frustrated by everything I'm about to say. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME AT IT'S CURRENT STATE AND/OR PRICE TAG.Before the ugly : THE CREW is not a complete mess, there is the possibility of having a great amount of fun playing this game depending on what kinda of player you are. One thing it gets right is the map diversion. Every spot, every city or zone as they say, has it's own feeling and design, it's unique, and driving around the map with a friend is sure entertaining. but that's it. if you're not the person who enjoys cross country trips or american cars, there is not much for you here. Entitled as ""MMO CAR-PG"" but you can't develop your character, not a single aspect. In theory, every player has the same exact character, solution? Let's hide other player's driver. and that's it. Let's say you play against remote controlled cars, for immersion's sake. you CAN'T call it an mmo, without character development, the best you'll get are perks, nothing really groundbreaking. but we have cars, don't we?There are 30~40 cars and all of them seem unfinished, except for the first ones. because you know, ""first impressions are always the most important"". the first five cars have all the specs available, street, dirt, performance, raid and circuit. other cars usually have 2~3 specs only. so you wanna go crazy off road with that expensive car? too bad. also, most cars are American, so no luxury here. what's most stupid is the unbalanced performance cars have, the starter vehicles run faster then the most expensive car in the game. But driving gets better as your car and player level increases, right? No. That's an excuse for the handling in the game. It doesn't get better. I have 1299 ( Max level ) cars and with assistance off, they just don't grip on the road as the default low level mustang does. With assistance on, it's just ""drifting"". The crew should have stayed as a street racing game only, the street tracks are okay, the handling on street is OK. but when it goes off-road becomes soap ( and not in a good 'Dirt game' way of soap ), on circuit the game just doesn't have enough decent physics to feel solid, and while climbing mountains with raid spec... I wish you good luck trying not to roll 900º in the air after hitting that small rock. this game is unpredictable thanks to it's physics, you never know how is your car going to react to crashes so expect for the worst and try avoiding collisions. worth adding : some elements break, some doesn't, and in this game this is not okay because when someone tries to cut their way trough some houses, the fences breaks. When you're doing the turn on a corner, well, the fence it very likely to be the most solid virtual object you'll ever find. Progression is BROKEN, I had to try various missions at least three times due to disconnects that WIPED my progress, my statistics are currently like this "" main missions complete : 167% "", and the rewards are ridiculously unbalanced. Let me explain this : I leveled from 1 to 50 in ONE DAY AND A HALF doing no more than 60 PvP matches, 10 or so story missions and some exploration. Yes, I reached maxed level on an MMO in basically a day. It gets better, I was being rewarded 16k bucks every time I finished first on a PvP match, and when you are disqualified because you couldn't get to the finish line in time, well, TAKE THESE 16K BUCKS ANYWAY. You just know they didn't really put any thought into the game's progression when all it takes from level 49 to 50 is 2 races in 10 minutes. The customization feels incomplete, some categories are there with no parts to purchase for you car, get used to the ""No part available in this category"" message. the stickers are single color only and there isn't variety among those, expect to see everyone using the same 2 flame stickers or racing stripes. the real car performance parts are available with a grind of challenges after level 50 which is not very cool given the insane difficulty of some challenges, but don't worry, it doesn't matter how fast your car is...AI CHEATS, it goes off track and spawns in front of you, It rams you constantly and the Catch-up is ridiculous. there are some gifs on Polygon's review of the crew if your interested. The story is not good, you bounce trough one generic dialog to the next and I couldn't connect to any character of this game, I couldn't care less to be honest and not skipping cutscenes was a challenge at times. At the end of the main story you are rewarded with a mix of every CGI they made for the game, which felt very very lazy.And I could go on, there is the server instability problem, the always online ""DRM"", the NAT problem that causes online atrocities, the lack of mirrors promised by launch, no weather system, the ""crew joining different lobbies"" bug, the ""Hitting someone back at 20mp/h and flying like when hit by a giant on skyrim"" bug, the ""I regret the money I spent buying this game"" case and the first time I actually emailed steam support to ask about their refund policy. I'm frustrated. I just wish I could go back to those TDU2 Times. tl;dr+ Every area is unique and has it's own feeling.+ Driving with friends can be funEdit (4/25/2015) :- A 2014 Racing game Lacking mirrors, promised by launch- Server instability, constant disconnections and progress Wipes- AI CHEATS- Incomplete customization ( Specs were added )- Not a great amount of cars ( Cars were added ) - Unbalanced car performances- Terrible car handling- Physics make for an unpredictable game- Broken progression system- Broken statistics system- Unbalanced reward system- Outdated graphics ( They fixed DoF at some camera angles )- Fake car engines- No photo mode- Cliche, generic storyline- Only 7 players on Screen- Season Pass could have been part of the game - TERRIBLE Online pvp lobby system ( Now fixed )			",330,50,16,39,23,2,20

												Welcome to The Fabulous The Crew,where if you want to actually have everything it has to offer you will need to buy the game 3 times,1 for the actual game,2 for the season pass,for the cars and stuff and 3 for the wild run expansion because without it you cant have the drift spec,and you want the drift spec,don't you?You will encounter a lot of bugs and glitches on your way,but dont worry,you can send a ticket to ubisoft,they will respond to it...someday,THEY ARE UPDATING THE GAME! to add a new car that comes in the season passLets not forget about our competitive level racing lobbies where there is one car,and there is one spec that you gotta use if you wanna win,the legendary Perf Laferarri,because everyone knows that if you enter a lobby,there will be at least 1 guy with a laferarri,and you know what happens when a guy takes laferarri? everybody takes laferarri.Have fun with the game,10/10 would get a refund and buy NFS 2015 instead			",68,8,7,5,6,1,3

												Wild Run Update: WR is out and after a few hours with it I can safely say that literally none of the concerns I have stated below has been fixed, in fact the game has gotten noticeable worse including, but not limited to:The new vehicles included in this expansion are even more expensive in the in-game money/real life bought money conversion. While a high-end car would set you back roughly 15-20 euros/dollars(!) in the original game, the new high-end cars will be over double that. You're looking at almost 40(!!) euros/dollars for a single car and that is without any upgrade which will easily be another 20 euros/dollars if you don't have 3-4 hours to grind the in-game money for it! Also they included something called ""Smart loot"" which instead of having you travel around to certain areas of the map for challenges, you can now instead just do the same challenge over and over and over again for 5 hours and eventually you'll have your fully upgraded cars. The new extreme modes, monster trucks, bikes and drifting are essentially gimmicks that will be fun for roughly an hour. The idea around The Summit is on paper a good idea but the execution of it is probably one of the worst ideas in a while. I could go into why at lenght but just know that unless you are ready to spend several hundreds (Yes, no joke) of hours in the game, it will leave you feeling unfulfilled and that you've wasted your time because The Summit requires you to compete against other players and only the best gets rewarded properly. I could go on and on and on, with how the side walks in the game are now actual edges that will make you car fly randomly or how drifting is 90% like driving in the snow in the vanilla game or how the game is so poorly optimized that the wet roads will make your computer stutter (Even on a 980 Ti!) and how the graphical update overall is a complete disappointment and the thousand other things I haven't mentioned.I'm going to have to stop writing here as I realize the more I think about it, the more I am actually going from thinking that the game was an okay game to directly hating it and regretting this purchase full stop.The Crew and The Wild Run could've been so much more but instead we got this...Original game review:I tried being positive about this game, but in the end I can't justify it from a gameplay perspective. I like exotic cars a lot which is what has kept me at this game for so long, but I doubt a lot of people have my level of ""addiction"" to exotic cars to justify it and end up disappointed in the game. Be aware that this is an arcady game, so if you're looking for a realistic simulation game, this is not it.The traffic is poorly implemented so if a player in your session has a bad connection, the traffic will swerve left and right and it will be hard to overtake.The max number of players in a FreeDrive session is capped at 8 which in 2015 is hilariously low for a game so heavily focused on multiplayer. In addition to that, you have no control over what session you end up in. And that is without going into the required always-on DRM that will eventually happen to kick you out of the game (That is a promise) that will set your progress back 5 to 45 minutes. The graphics are mediocre and everything in the world except player cars looks like something that was made in 2010. The sound is bordering on the ridiculous (Sorry UbiSoft, but a Koeniggsegg does not sound like a BMW with a custom exhaust) and the forced disconnect if you are AFK for 10 minutes (You are returned to the start Splash screen, not even disconnected where you parked your car before going AFK) gives this game a overall poor immersion.The price decrease came too late and the game population has sort of fizzled out - That being said, it was briefly revived by the announcement of the upcoming expansion pack and the 2 hour trial. A trial that was poorly implemented. When you play the trial you meet people which makes this game a lot better, but by the end of the trial people are straight up disconnected with no chance of saying anything to the other drivers the person was driving with - The only way around this is to add them to your UbiSoft friendlist - But good luck remembering the names of the players!The game gets grindy real fast. The laughable short story does not reward you in any way towards a full upgraded car, nor does it provide you enough cash to have an acceptable level of cars with upgrades. The game essentially forces you into buying in-game cash for real money to a gross extent. 20 euros will roughly be the equivalent of 5 hours of gaming. Speaking of Euros, having encountered a bunch of Americans in the game they have proudly told me that they pay in dollars instead. In UbiSoft's world 20 euros = 20 dollars.If you ignore all of the above and you spend the 30 euros/$30 just to cruise around and complete the main story the game is fine. However, if you know cars you will cringe. If you're a completionist you will burn out fast as the game has Tetris levels of variety in gameplay.With all that being said, will I continue to play it just for cruising around in the single car I spend 15 hours to upgrade fully? Yes, I probably will.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're looking for a good racing game, this isn't really it. The physics are wonky, the AI is notorious for rubber-banding (which is really noticable in the 1 hour+ ""raid"" races), and online everybody is out for blood. That said, I still recommend this game for one real reason: It's spectacularly fun to just drive around. The map is absolutely massive -- it takes about 45 minutes to drive coast-to-coast, and the best part about it is that it's not locked to where you are in the story. After the first few hours, you get a fairly hefty sum of premium currency -- not enough to buy endgame content like a hypercar, but you can do quite a bit with it, including going well out of your way to buy a car you really want.If what you want in a car game is the ability to just drive around on a massive, diverse map, I can't think of any game better than The Crew to do it in.

												The Crew is a multiplayer always-online arcade-racer set in a huge open world which is a condensed version of the United States. It was designed by many of the same people who created Test Drive Unlimited, so it can effectively be thought of as TDU 3. It contains many of the same features, but not all (no houses or shops).

			In this video I redo the early missions in Detroit, which I didn't record first time around. This video showcases the different types of story missions quite well, and ends with the most fun type of...		

I think many people are unfairly critical of this game, and are failing to appreciate the best feature, the huge open world. In reality, the world area is only around 5000 sq km (about a quarter of the size of Wales), yet that's still a huge size for a game world, possibly the second largest open world racing game (Fuel is over twice as big). Road wise, there's 10,000 km of roads, 10 times as much as in the first TDU game, so that will take a long time to explore properly. But it's not just the size of the world that's impressive, it's the attention to detail and the huge number of landmarks. It's extremely well designed.The USA is not only condensed, but distorted, some areas are much larger than others. This is necessary since if everything was to scale, every city would be a tiny village. Instead, the biggest cities are made much larger, as well as features like the Grand Canyon, while less interesting areas are shrunk in size. The result is greatly distorted, but it feels really good to drive around, and I believe it does a good job of representing the ""highlights"" of the USA in a way which suits a computer game very well.

Many people have complained about the horrible car physics. I was a bit shocked at this too in the beginning, but it turns out that the early cars handle badly by design, and get much better as you upgrade them with parts. The few cars I've tried from the DLCs handle much better. It also takes a little while to tweak your wheel or controller settings to get it to feel good, but it's worth the effort.

Apparently rubber banding is also a problem in the game, although I did read someone say it's been fixed. I've noticed it a few times with police chases, but it doesn't seem to be much of a problem to me. Speaking of police chases, I find them to be a lot of fun, while others seem to hate them. Similarly, the raid challenges can be quite frustrating, but are also fun to me. Depends on your point of view I suppose.The GPS tends to provide the shortest route between two points, which is often not the best way to get to where you want quickly (taking you through backstreets instead of sticking to main roads), but hey, SatNav does that in real life too! Just think of it as a guide that you don't have to stick to. Learning the main roads and using your ""local knowledge"" instead can save time! Also it tends to suggest offroad shortcuts, which can be annoying if you want to stick to roads, but on the other hand, it gives you a route through difficult scenery which you might otherwise get stuck in.One annoying thing I have noticed is graphical glitches during the cut scene intros to most missions. Don't know what's causing this, but it's only a minor irritation, it doesn't happen when I'm driving.Another slight peeve is that much of the terrain is too destructible, you can drive straight through lamp posts and other features as if they weren't even there, yet some are rock solid. It's sometimes hard to know which is which. Okay, so it's just an arcade game so you could say it's excusable, but it does lead to bad driving habits, driving through obstacles that you'd normally avoid. In fact, to win certain missions it's often a good idea to crash through things.https://youtu.be/blIdOUmGMh8Same goes for crashing into other cars, often (not always) this has little or no effect, barely slowing you down in most instances. Again, I don't like this because it encourages bad driving habits, not caring about hitting other cars when normally you should try to avoid them at all costs. But again, it's an arcade game, so I can live with it.Sure, there are a few faults with this game, but most of them hardly matter to me. The game world is so large, with so many places to go, so many things to see (there's educational info on historical landmarks) and so many cars to drive (not a huge selection, but there are many variants of each, and who needs hundreds of cars anyway?) that I'm having too much fun cruising and exploring to take much notice of the faults. I think if people focused less on the faults and concentrated more on the fun aspects of the game, they'd enjoy it a lot more.For me the FreeDrive mode is the real game, going on road trips solo or with friends. I dont' really care about the missions and the story that much (although they do add a nice bit of character to the game), I just want to explore America!Having said that, the game gets more interesting the deeper you get into it. As you level up you unlock factions and faction missions, and that adds a lot more fun to the game, not to mention money! Some say that money is hard to come by and there's a lot of grinding, but they're wrong, money is easy to make. It's not a ""pay to win"" game, you can pay if you're lazy, but you can make it easily enough by simply playing the game.I'm really enjoying The Crew and I highly recommend it to positive gamers who enjoy exploring a huge open world, who don't mind the arcadey gameplay and can live with a few faults. Be sure to get the Gold Edition or buy the Season Pass to get a bunch of good cars that unlock fairly early in the game, to give you a decent variety of cars to go free roaming in, otherwise you'll be stuck with the early cars for a while.Negative focused nit-pickers need not apply!

IntroductionThe Crew is an open-world MMO racing game where you can play either as a street racer or a law enforcer (DLC) made by Ivory Tower in collaboration with Ubisoft Reflections. The gameplay, in general, is like one of those classic old-school Need For Speed i.e. Need For Speed Carbon, Need For Speed Underground, etc. You can drive around in a scaled-down map of the U.S. freely and visit mission activation points to race. Although The Crew is a MMO game, the game does have a single player element in it, meant to be played concurrently with the online play or used as an introduction of the gameplay. The online gameplay works similarly with Need For Speed (2016) and Grand Theft Auto V - you will be put in a session with several other players and you can interact with them in races/free-run. You will also occasionally receive racing invitations from other players.Pros and ConsPros1. Lots of car variation. Again, similar to old NFS games, you have tons of choices of cars. You also can switch cars you own on-the-street using a 'mobile garage'.2. Strong MMO aspect. Grinding for money, parts, experience, skill points, crew skills, etc makes the game worth a lot of hours.3. Customizable driving elements - sensitivity, handling control, etc.4. The Crew is going for the niche of arcade racing, so don't expect realistic driving experience like in Project Cars or Asetto Corsa. However, this connects to point (1) in the Cons list.5. Beautifully made map - not necessarily in the context of quality, the map itself feels much more alive than other racing games and I really do enjoy driving around for no reason at all. The variation of the terrain is generally accurate of the real geographical aspects of the U.S. and is definitely a plus for the gameplay.6. Massive map. Devs actually created the entire scaled-down map of the U.S. It can take quite a while to get from point A to point B. IMO, this is gold for an open-world racing game.7. Environment is alive. Unlike the dead city in NFS series, you actually have pedestrians, commercial airplanes, planes watering a farm, etc. You can use train stations and airports, too. This is one of the reasons I enjoy driving around in the game.8. Complete day-and-night cycle 9. Challenging races - your car's power in general can't be too far ahead of your opponents.10. Big variation in the gameplay: classical circuit & sprint street racing, off-roads, stunt tracks, police chase (DLC), time limits, impromptu open world events, etc.11. Detailed, color-customizable car interior12. First-person POV availableCons1. I somehow feel like I'm driving a toy car in this game, especially when I drift. It's just weird and off in general. I fiddled with the settings quite a bit and managed to make it a bit more realistic, but it's still...too virtual? This is a highly popular complaint by other reviewers and I have to say I agree with them. The physics of the game is just ridiculous - both in driving and in the environment. I know the niche is arcade racing but they should at least keep a good balance between easy and realistic instead of going full-on 'toy car mode'.2. Graphical quality is not that great and inconsistent. In some areas, you can notice that the environment texture is very crude but some other places do make quite a scenery. This gives me the 'immersion ruined' feeling since I'm very meticulous on graphical details. (Played on 4K Ultra settings)3. The voice actors are seriously bad and cringy from the start, but the voice actors in Calling All Units DLC are much worse. I can't help thinking that they made an arbitrary decision to use one of their own staff as an emergency substitute for the original voice actors who are not available for the DLC making.4. Cliche, boring storyline.5. They clearly didn't put much effort in texturing the background characters, both cars and people.6. Performance should be more optimized. Games with this level of graphical details shouldn't ask for that level of specs. This issue is extremely similar with Ubisoft's optimization issue with Watch Dogs 2 - crude graphics, but highly performance demanding.7. This one is purely subjective, but I find the radio songs to be very, very annoying. I am aware most in-game radio tracks are from new artists looking to promote their songs, like in GTA V and Watch Dogs 2, I can still accept the quality of the tracks. But in The Crew, I lost all of my tolerance to bad music. I finally made my own Classical musics and Lorde - Royal playlist, which doesn't go well with racing games but apparently, I have no choice.8. Cutscene camera was clearly designed to be bombastic, dramatic, and fast-cuts-style - this makes me nauseous.9. I'm not a fan of 'powers' (EMP, UI disabled, etc)- makes the game too arcade-y in an extreme way and definitely a killer of immersion. If I want powers, I would play Mario Kart. I do not expect these kind of things from The Crew or NFS Hot Pursuit.NeutralProgress is a bit slow. Racing rewards are a bit too low for me and the mission points are too far apart. Some people prefer this method to keep them engaged in the game for an extended period of time. But as someone who don't have that much time to play games, this style doesn't fit me. This is a very personalized point, so you decide the value based on your own life schedule.ConclusionIs it worth the price? Yes Is the CAU DLC worth paying for? Yes. The base game itself offers a lot of hours of playtime with its massive content. If you enjoy arcade racing, The Crew is your ultimate-updated-graphics arcade racing game. If you enjoy old NFS play styles combined with a big variation of cars, The Crew can also be a great fit for you. As a comparison with one of its competitor, Need For Speed (2016), The Crew lacks the physics realism, storyline, and general cutscene quality, but it offers more cars and gameplay variance. I would also recommend this game for people who love driving around, exploring various geographical landscapes.The CAU DLC's police chase content itself is already worth it. It's a great newly-added gameplay variance where you get to be the law enforcer and chase actual players. The police cars are also very cool to have and worth grinding for.Sidenote: For people who are complaining about the DLC not being unlocked after purchasing it through Steam, simply play other missions for a while, restart the game, and it will fix itselfI hope my review can help you decide whether to purchase this game!Thank you for reading.

												I wanted to love it, and I thought I did.  Little did I know, I was in denial.  In the trailer, they made it seem like you could roam around and see hundreds of people driving different cars.  This wasn't the case, because1) There are like 12 cars in the game, so no one has anything different.  If you're used to Forza 4 or Horizon, don't buy this.2) There aren't any massive servers.  There are only 8 cars roaming around including yourself.Overall, I'd give this game a 6/10.  It's really fun for the first two days; I'll give it that.  Once you finish those two days of cruising, it gets boring.  It gets to be a pain to play.  It becomes a grind to get what you want, which wouldn't benefit you in the long run anyway because unlike Forza, where certain cars have more potential, you can take a 370z and make it faster than a Pagani Huayra, both in handling and speed.And the AIs.  Oh my god... The AIs.  They're not part of the physics engine.  If your car is one point behind the ""recommended level"" they leave you in the dust.  If your car is one point within range of being too low, you leave them in the dust.  It's not even about skill.This is my first time leaving a review, so I'm not sure if you guys can message me or not. If you can, feel free to ask a question about the game.  Message me.Once again, 6/10.			",57,0,4,4,3,0,0

												Pay full price for a game, and they still want you to pay for the best cars.  I will never recommend a cash grab of that nature.   Yes, you can purchase some of the cars with in-game money.  But of course the best (most fun) cars require cash-only purchases.  I actually enjoy the game and will continue to play it.  But I will NEVER recommend it to my friends.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""The Crew"" is supposed to be advertised as this revolutionary ""Always-Online"" MMO car racing game that many people have been sitting around for years to be made. It delivers an exciting experience when read on paper, however when actually excuted makes for a sloppily made game which show obvious signs of outdated programming, and included with it an even archaic attempt to jump into the racing genre a few years too late. The ideas presented for this game are fantastic, an always online MMO where people can join crews and race against each other representing their gang, crew or team. (Basically whatever you want to call it.)The main problem lies in the focus that the game progression system, driving mechanics, progression system and general programming are flawed in so many ways it makes me wonder what year they drafted this game in before they took it to the crafting table. Design wise, the game's success is at the core of it's pitch. The ""Always online racing MMO car game that thrives while you are offline"" with a ""Progression system of great detail and complete customization"". The game focuses hard on trying to give users a feeling that the world moves on without them, and you can visibly see this in (what should be) other players actively driving around the map going objective to mission points while in active traffic along side you. Theme wise, it catches the feel of Detroit decent well, but sadly seems more or less like a rip-off towards other racing games themes that tend to stick with the south-central LA area and Detroit (Generic East Coast Theme.) There's no variation in location until the later portion of the game, and for the most part you will only see major shift changes in the locale when you move away from Detroit when you move across central USA, the dirty south, the pacific northwest, and the southwest. The map's design is heavily (and for the most part completely) based on the idea of the whole USA as a driveable entity. It's lacking point however is that there's little to no detail outside the area of Detroit, and similarly detailed areas tend to stay grouped up within each other leaving huge spans of empty road between the different regions. (Example : Central US, Between Detroit and Florida).Progression wise, the game tries to give users a sense of calm as progression unlocks aren't solely limited to ""street races"". Other goals lead to stunt jumps, checkpoint races and time attack objectives. These types of objectives spark the inner racer within all of us who prefer to beat personal times, which is great for some users. However, because progression is done with small objectives in mind to ""Level"" up your car to qualify for specific races, you'll spend more time driving frustratingly difficult time attack, check point, and stunt jump objectives due to the lack of responsive and ""actually useable"" car handling. Car handling is heavily tied to progression as the cars at early levels drive akin to that of an ice cube sliding on the ground. The cars when driven at their base level tend to be very unresponsive at the least, and you're more then likely to spin out regardless of whether or not you slow down at a corner properly or use the emergency breaks. Early game progression unlocks help ease this problem, however like I said before, you will spend a huge amount of time on small unlocks to truly level up your car to it's max potential. The pitch for this is that higher level cars are more responsive, and thus drive better. Mechanically speaking, the game runs well for what we've seen of it's previously noted issues. (Previously in beta, the animations were directly tied to the frames of the game data). Now that full 60fps support is ""Unlocked"" in the options, the lack of speed that users claimed to have in the beta is completely gone. You now have a complete sense of speed when you throttle your car above 100mph. *(160kh/m for you other homies out there.)* However, optimization in this game and it's calculation of physics and other players tend to take the game's performance below the 60fps region when in heavy traffic, but never drops below 30fps. *Hint hint* None the less, setting the graphics down in this game will tend to ease the wrath of traffic, of the obvious drawback of image quality. In addition, there are still flaws with the animation which obviously give away the fact the game was from the start developed with 30fps in mind. (Which isn't entirely a big problem, however when you play games like this which rely on user input, the resonsiveness and feeling the user gets while playing is the biggest selling point in how the game performs on a face level.) **Plot** I'm not going to say much, so far from what I've experienced the story seems akin to most standard street race movies. You are the brother to the leader of an infamous street racing gang called the 510. One day he needs you to follow him to a meet up, brother is shot and you get framed as the murderer. Fast forward five years, in an effort to clear your name and find your brothers killer, and the crooked cop who framed you for the murder, you proceed to work for the FBI to rise the ranks and bring justice back to the streets.Simply put, not exactly the best writing, character development for the lead character is non-existent and the progression of the prologue goes by so fast I honestly thought there was another beginning section I had skipped beforehand. Multiplayer wise, you're more likely to have more fun playing with the CPU then you do with actual players. Missions introduced throughout the game have two options for execution. You have the ability for solo gameplay which allows you to compete against computer opponents and progress through the game. (The only real MMO online element begins here.) For actual multiplayer, lobbies are formed via missions when you select the option to ""race online"" for that specific mission. Users are then paged, and/or formed based on who are currently doing the mission and are gathered from that method. Users past that area, or users who have not progressed to that specific portion of the game typically do not respond or bother to play online due to the lack of users because of inconsistency with progression. Half the time you will spend it again, with the CPU racing offline. With a majority of your online experiences happening at the higher levels where non-mandatory race missions are more freqent and people will be fully utilizing the ""Crew"" feature more.Overall, the game is a fun chuckle. It has it's flaws, and could be a great game with fixes. Due to it's limited playability however, and it's very difficult progression system combined with a linearly designed multiplayer it falls short on the expectations created for it at it's announcement. Did Ubisoft deliver what they promised? Partly.The game however is far from complete. For this, I have to give it a thumbs down. A game in general should be well fleshed out especially past it's multiple alpha, and beta stages which had the ability for vast numbers of user input. At this point in time it should be moderately well developed enough to not show this many flaws. I've already spent my money, and I'll continue to play it to see how development progresses. At this current point and stage from it's inital release from CORE features that were already planned for the game and is executed in it's fullest, there's no telling what can happen.tl;dr it's a rushed poor mans version of need for speed before EA became return of the sith			",223,17,12,14,12,1,13

												Summary: Good game 8/10 I'd recommend waiting for a small sale at least before purchasing.Pros:+ Giant open world+ Fully Voiced and Subtitled story (40 Hrs for me)+ Multitude of different game modes+ Good Graphics (for not much Processing Power)+ Month long ""Summit"" events from the WildRun DLC that end in free cars being given out (Mazda MX-5 Miata At the time of this review)+ Multiple Specs/Classes of cars (6 Vanilla; 9 Wildrun)+ Fairly Detailed Customization (Bumpers, Hoods, Rims, Paint, etc.)+ Rewards for exploration (ie. Hidden Cars)+ Nice Community+ Multiple real world race tracks of different styles and uses+ Good Controller compatability and Rebindable keysCons:- Most of the map is vacant forest area which is hard to cross at any speed- Off the Specs/Classes of cars that you are given a few of them you can't change anything on your car except paint, rims, and interior colors- Some of the game modes can get very repetative and the game might start to feel like a grind at times- The Story is a little short in my opinion for the size of the game especially the map- PvP can be very difficult for players who don't have higher leveled cars/bikes- The Physics is not very good (ie. if you see a rock, Avoid it. You will be sent flying or crash no matter what car you're driving.)- Bikes are very difficult to control with just a keyboard- The AI in this game is not very smart and can be very stupid at times (for example the longer the police chase you the easier they are to lose no matter the wanted level; or if there is a very obvious shortcut the AI will just go the normal way; or even if you get close to a pedestrian they wil jump away even if you aren't moving, they also repeat the same dialog options)- Microtransactions (Need I say more?)- Only the lower 48 US states (No Hawaii, Alaska, Canada, or Mexico)- Some major cities have been completely forgoten about (ie. San Diego, Phoenix, Portland, etc.)- No Realism in terms of Physics - Lots of Complaints of unreliability and glitchesConclusion:Would I recommed this game? Yes. Why? Because it is a unique game with some querks and drawbacks but overall if you are at all into racing games I would recommend picking it up especially if it's on sale.Verdict:8/10			",44,4,8,5,22,0,5

												This game should have not have been $60. With all the DLC, it is such a shameless money grab. Just to buy certian motorcycles, you need to own TWO DLCs! TWO! Each being $25. And it's not like you unlock them once you get both DLCs... YOU HAVE TO GRIND THE MONEY UP FOR THEM! Seriously, this game has gotten sad. I was excited to get the new cars in the game, but for some reason, you need the 'Calling All Units' DLC to buy these, EVEN IF THE CARS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DLC! Just shameful...

												Most of the complaints about this game are entirely valid, and yet I'm still totally satisfied to sit down behind my G27 and just drive until my wrists are sore and my finger tips develop calluses.I don't care about the broken multiplayer, lack of a real physics model, lack of story depth, shallow tuning, short list of cars, dumb in-game GPS navigation, cheaters on the leaderboards, rubber banding AI, terrible marketing, etc, etc.The handling model is sufficient, the cars sound decent, there's a cockpit view & hood view, G27 support is alright, frame rate is super consistent (60 FPS on an overclocked GTX 760 with mostly High options, FXAA & no shadows), and the game has been completely stable for me.If you simply like to drive, then you should buy.

												The game is fun, The racing is just arcadey enough to be fun and just as real to be a challenge in close matchups.The multiplayer aspect is cool but currently not an ""MMO"". Community manager Natchai_Ubisoft on the forums said ""you'll currently have a maximum of 8 per session "" and to me that's bull. I paid for an MMO racing game not forza horizon with a bigger map and less people. So if you're looking to get this for the social side and expect to constantly be talking to people or bumping into others who want to tear down the highway it's kind of a bust. I am indecisive but my end decision is going to be not recommended because of the lack of MM in an MMO game			",76,11,7,3,6,0,5

												Nice job screwing over people that already bought this game. People that want all the content but haven't bought the game yet can pay a measly 50 USD for everything, but you're going to charge people that already bought the game an extra 45 USD for the expansions. What was even the point of the season pass? I get a bunch of cars. Yeah, whatever. Why weren't the expansions a part of that? Great business practice, Ubisoft.

												I don't fully understand why there are so many bad reviews both on Steam and on the web... There are a lot of great things about this game and it really is next-gen with both it's graphics and absolutely fantastic open-world. Instead of writing a long and strenuous paragraph however; I will simply provide the pro's and con's of this game.Pro's:-Insane Open World (largest I have ever experienced in video game)-Beautiful Graphics (despite what others have said, when you crank this thing to ultra it sure is a beauty)-Good Handling/Physics (change the in-game handling in the settings to ""sport"" or ""hardcore"")-Beautiful Cars (they look basically the same as they do realistically)-Selection of Music (different radio stations that you can choose in-game while driving are really cool)-An Alive World (you'll see trains, planes, cars, pedestrians, trucks, law enforcement, et cetera anywhere you go)-Difficulty (it isn't a little kids game you can easily beat; it does take some skill)-Attention to Detail (there are abandoned houses in deserts that each look totally different, cops have different accents according to the state their in, landmarks can be found throughout the map and provide you with real-life facts about those destinations, et cetera)-Decent Story (it has a story and that's what counts in my opinion, it isn't amazing but it doesn't suck either)-Car Spec's (they are very cool and unlike what most people say; you do feel a difference between them)-Only Next-Gen Racing Game Available on PC (as of my knowledge, there are no other racing games on the PC that were released at the same time as the Crew. All of the Crew's competition like Forza Horizon 2 or Driveclub are only limited to the consoles at the moment)Con's-Some Buggy A.I. (especially in cop chases!)-Not A Huge Selection of Cars (I don't fully know how to explain it, but I feel there should just be a more varied selection of cars)-No Profanity Settings (I know I'm getting a little ridiculous here but it would be nice to have an option to bleep out the swears)-Not the Customization I was Expecting (it's not horrible but there just aren't that many customization options)-Pathetic Community (I have tried many times to do a proper co-op race with random players and it always fails because no one will join. I have also been bombarded by trolls that are hacking in high spec'd cars that do not meet there driver level at all)-Always Online (this hasn't affected me a ton but it's a bit irritating and can get a little laggy with a lot of players)-Crashes (due to the always online part; I have crashed a few times. Fortunately the game always saves my progress so it hasn't affected me yet)-DLC (although it won't really matter whether you get it or not in the campaign, I could see there being Pay2Win's in PvP. Like seriously Ubisoft, don't make people spend $60 on a brand new game just to be greeted by the stupid $25 DLC Season Pass)Summary:Should you buy this game? Well, if you love racing games and you love exploration and you have a beasty rig (that meets the recommended settings or even the minimum settings) then buy this game, It is fantastic. If you don't have what I mentioned but are still contemplating purchasing the game, it might be best to wait until the price goes down; $60 is expensive.Anyway, if you read this entire review and found it to be helpful; then thank you for your support! Hopefully it did help you to make a decision. ^.^			",8,4,4,0,3,0,2

												I'm so disappointed with this game, there's a lot of good, but there's a lot of bad as well.The Crew is a game made by Ivory Tower and published by Ubisoft. The Crew is an MMO where you explore the US with your crew which consists of you and your friends.Story wise the game follows on Alex Taylor. You are a rookie racer and your brother is the founder of a nation wide racing group called the 5-10. You want to join, but before you can prove yourself, your brother is murdered by another 5-10 named Shiv who teamed up with a corrupt FBI agent. A few years pass and an agent by the name of Zoe comes by with a deal, help her put both of them behind bars and you become free. But you need to work up the 5-10 chain before you can get to Shiv, so you need to build a crew from all over the country.The Crew offers a one time campaign which you can play solo or with friends. A lot of the events are identical in every region. Get to a state, find the next member of your crew, do jobs for them and repeat in an other country to work your way to Shiv. Some of the missions, include time trials, races, chases, take down missions and destroy missions where you have to destroy shipments of stuff.The graphics and the entire map are incredibly well designed. I've spent 5 hours alone on driving around and seeing the sights and trust me it's incredibly fun and at the time of me writing this review I still haven't explored the entire map, so there's a lot more to explore.The gameplay itself, is pretty decent. The game offers you different type of cars, like circuit, raid, dirt, street and perf cars which you can use to drive on different types of terrain.  A lot of them handle differently, like the circuit vehicles are incredibly fast, but brake terribly, raid vehicles can drive through all the terrain, so you can use them to drive up on mountain areas.The game also has online races, but you can forget doing Crew events cause literally no one is playing the crew races, every event is solo only and the matchmaking is some of the worst stuff, I have ever seen. If someone in the lobby has terrible internet, tough ♥♥♥♥. You will be stuck on the message that say's trying to reconnect the player having problems. The game doesn't kick him out and trust me sometimes it gets annoying when in a single race the game pauses the race multiple times trying to reconnect other players. The game also suffers from really big issues, like AI rubber banding players in the top position. and the AI in the lower positions give up on the races trying to ram each other of the road when they get the chance to do so. The game also suffers from clipping issues where you ram something so hard your car will get stuck in whatever you hit.The game overall is a really fun game, but a lot of major issues make this game not worth the full price. On a discount I can safely say you can get the game and you will not be disappointed, by the game. Final Rating:6/10 - Only buy on a discountIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.

												As a racing fan since for over a decade, The Crew is the best racing game I've played, and that's saying a lot. I've played every Need For Speed and Gran Turismo. And The Crew trully shows what an open world racing game is supposed to be.It has a good open world environment to it. The USA map is perfect. Deserts, snowy mountains, swamp, forests, dry hills, plains, farms, cities, towns, villages, interesting land marks. Good variety of cars with good customization. If you're looking for TDU2 or Need for speed most wanted (2005) type games, the Crew is what you're looking for.			",191,22,9,18,13,4,15

												I will separate this into two categories: Single Player and Multiplayer. Seeing as both have different stories to tell, I feel it would be appropriate to split them up. Warning, there may be spoilers, but nothing that will ruin the whole story. Enjoy.Single player:The single player has a great story, as do most games made by Ubisoft. You start the story as Alex Taylor, a man and brother who gets put into prison and framed for his brothers' death, which was caused by the main antagonist, Shiv. Throughout the story, you compete and earn your rank through a sort of street gang lead by various characters by their status, (V2, V4, V6) ultimately trying to get to the top, V8, where Shiv stands. Each city you unlock, which I might add are major cities throughout the United States, (LA, New York, Miami, etc.) you gain new members to your crew, or basically guidance and emotional support to your driving and discovery of locations, races and more. Your crew becomes a valuable asset to you, both becoming good friends and especially people you can count on. Now, for the actual review part:The single player had some good moments, great scenes, and overall a great racing experience. The handling of vehicles is the best I've seen throughout all my years of racing games, and takes the cake for that. The only thing I really wish they would have done was spend more time on the ending. It seemed very rushed and very anti-climactic. This though does not change my overall feel of the game, I still love it. Multiplayer:Multiplayer can be a separate story on its own simply in the fact you can basically go anywhere, with anyone. Traveling far distances with friends or strangers can be quite a great experience, especially if you can tolerate driving for literally hours at a time in real time. To put into perspective, you can probably make it across the whole map (let's say LA to Maine) in about an hour, or close to. This is driving at full speed, at least at 330km/h (at least I was). There's plenty of places to visit, plenty of great atmospheric areas to go to. It can be very biased, but if you're not into driving for hours at a time, I wouldn't bother playing multiplayer, I'd just stick to the story. All in all, it's a great game for what it's worth, can include hundreds of hours of multiplayer time if you're into it, or if not, you can free roam around at your will (and even go offroading in a dirt spec or raid vehicle!).

												This Review is heavily outdated but I'll give you the summary of how the game is now.-Traffic exists and is always annoying in free-roam. [Shout out to the downhill drifters in the mountain state smashing into buses on every corner]-The servers are trash and sessions barely work most of the time.-New Car releases being only buyable via microtransaction currency is garbage for a game that's dying, which means Ivory Tower and Ubisoft are trying to get as much as possible from this game's whales.-Physics are awful-Customization is still awful and isn't being expanded on other then condensing categories of existing elements.-Monster trucks were a mistake.[Wasted Development Time]-Who the hell wanted bikes?[Wasted Development Time]-Shader revamp still isn't good enough, the car headlights are dying flashlights that barely light up anything.-Race track lamps don't cast light (what the actual ♥♥♥♥ Ivory Tower?) So it's dark as hell with your awful car lights.-Most previous issues about the game still exist like barely anything to do other then drifting (Which you have to buy the wild run for)(Wild Run DLC is literally ""Buy this if you want to drift and have actual fun"")-Drifting isn't as good as it could be (Because you can't edit anything about the handling of the car apart from RNG Parts WHICH THEY MADE EVEN HARDER TO GET.)-Rx7 was put in for ridiculously high prices to force more Microtransactions.gg Ubisoft edgelords being incompetent still.Ivory Tower you can do better then this ♥♥♥♥, c'mon._____[OLD REVIEW BEFORE WILDRUN]Summary at the Bottom.The Crew is a game I was quite excited for since I played the Beta, though it is suffering from some massive issues and probably more as I play more. My review style is usually pointing out the negatives, as negatives are easier to see then positives, which positives clog the list up if you try to find them and it becomes a mess.Note: I didn't pay fully for the game with my own money(I sold TF2 ♥♥♥♥ on the market), so I am not biased by how much money I invested.Lets get started..•AI-The AI is the type to mimic what the player does if it's not in 1st place, you'll notice this if you're already playing.-And they just do things that are outright impossible. In the video Jim Sterling made at the 8 minute mark, there's a AI controlled car that just does what he is doing except at a ridiculous level and still is faster. This is a massive problem when you're racing AI and they pull this.-Source of the ridiculously bad AI; http://youtu.be/MJbAt5QWDhU?t=8m21s He's not even racing him cause it's the prologue and he's doing this cause that's how they're coded, and in races they do the exact crap.-There are also times where they go through civilian traffic vehicles to keep up with you, it's extremely unfair and frustrating.-Faction missions where you have to race these very AI for an hour or 2 is just the most infuriating thing imaginable, imagine that AI, doing insane stuff and keeping up with you while you're trying your best to not slam into traffic in crowded cities at 150-200mph and the AI is going through it like it doesn't even exist with no consequences in handling. Not fun at all and I'd say avoid ones that have you racing the AI in those long missions.•Customization-Kits are another issue, many kits aren't done yet which should of been if the game had to be delayed.-Kits like the raid or circuit, you can't customize the body for the few cars that currently have it.-You can't color your rims(Which would be so easy to put in), so you're stuck with Grey/Default, black, white, and sometimes gold)-There isn't too many selections, for instance in Dirt, if I wanted a certain headlight setup, with fog lights, I couldn't do it, I had to have fog lights with a different setup of headlights. A tad restrictive and could possibly be easily fixed seeing as the fog lights are ontop of the model.-Vinyl's are somewhat dull as well as restrictive seeing as what you see is what you get, no color changing what so ever, so you'd have to tailor your core vehicle color to the vinyl or just either have no vinyl or pick a different one.•Cars-Pretty much a 14 year olds wet dream, there's a bunch of Exotics and Muscle Cars with barely any Japanese Cars.-When you start, you have the choice between 3 identical looking American boats, or the one Japanese Car, barely much variety to start with.-There's some Civilian cars that look pretty damn good and would add greatly to the selection, but they chose to make them just cars to pass by or get in your way.-Tuning is pretty much non-existant, the only thing you're doing is upgrading parts, not tuning. Static upgrades. No body tuning, or engine tuning. The spec kits are the only thing that 'tune' your car.•Misc-G27 and other wheel controller support is still awkward and the Force Feedback is not good to play with, it jerks the wheel randomly and you're constantly fighting it, no matter if your on Sports or Hardcore, you have to turn Force feedback down to play with a wheel enjoyably-Personally I don't really like nitrous boosts in games, but that's just my peeve, the mechanic is there so note that.-Crew system has problems with disconnecting at the end of missions, instancing, etc.-The Police are ridiculous during missions or higher level stars, like they're psychopaths who got a Police car and want to kill you at the cost of killing themselves, and suffer from the typical AI problems.-Physics are ridiculous, as the community calls them Cat-Physics, your car will try it's best to stay on all 4 wheels, which causes ridiculous things to happen if your wheels get off center.-Text Chat censors such stupid letter combinations making it impossible to have normal conversations.On the topic of drifting; If you want to know what kit is best for drifting, it's Street. It use to be Dirt, but the handling changes made the the dirt kit less optimal for that.I will add on more to this review as I play more.•Summary.-The AI is Terrible and Unfair-Customization is more limited then it should be(It doesn't need to be NFS Underground, but it can easily be better then what it is)-Car selection is very uninspired and bland.-Currently doing missions in a crew has issues and kicks people out of the game and having their rewards lost.-Nitrous is a mechanic and is pretty much needed to be used in missions.-G27/Wheel support needs work-Assets in the game that should be used but aren't.-Game is still unfinished even after a Release delay, unobtainable kits cause they're not ""finished"".-No user radio for immersion sake, and the music selection is very boring. You'll have to resort to listening to your own music outside of the game.-Missions due to the AI aren't fun-Popo are not fun and you might as well let them catch out outside of missions if your star level is too high.-Text Chat censors are terrible, and was rushed.-Physics are counter-intuitive and can mess you up especially during jumps.-There is no Tuning, changing Specs is the only 'tuning' you'll get.Wait for a discount or hold off until more updates come out. It's not that fun in its current state. It has the potential to be fun, just not currently. ",173,9,4,14,5,2,7

But after a month and few days after release game, nothing's changed. I can tell only, DONT BUY THIS GAME!!			",136,25,10,13,15,0,12

												-I've read people say this is sort of what TDU/2 is supposed to have been. I never played them. The nearest to open world racing I have experienced is Burnout Paradise. My comparisons will be based on Paradise.   First, the main draw, I think, is the sheer scope. Meant to represent the continental USA, the game world is huge and divided into 5 sections: East coast, west coast, the South, Midwest, and Mountain. In each region, there is a handful of towns, of varying sizes from the region. the South for example, has Nashville, New Orleans, Miami(which is one of the 5 major cities in the game), Dallas, and others. The midwest, where the beta starts and focuses on, has Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis.  Between them and the west coast is  Las Vegas and the desert, as well as other towns.Detroit, St. Louis, and Chicago had landmark areas to visit that would give a quick sentence or two on a neighborhood, factory( Detroit's Ford factory included). Unfortunately I can't say I know anything about the 3 cities in game where landmarks are described, so i don't know how many are real or not.-What about that open-world, no loading screen driving?Well, the game touts being able to drive ""coast to coast"". You can do that. If you don't want to, pull into a town, and feel free to use the train station or airport as a sort of fast travel to different towns.  You can actually fast travel to any specific spot you've driven to. What this means is I start in Detroit, fly to Miami or San Francisco, drive to the nearby wilderness, warp to detroit, and warp back to that isolated desert plateau.Speaking of towns and landmarks, some regions have real world race tracks or mountain trails. Pike's Peak is very close to St. Louis, while Mazda's Laguna Seca course is close to the western coast line. There are other trails  and tracks, but those were the two I personally visited and ran. For those of you curious, Pike's Peak is in its gravel glory.-There's a lot of driving, what kind of driving is it?Well, it isn't as arcadey as Burnout Paradise,Initial D, Fast and Furious, or other arcade machine driving games. With that said, it isn't Gran Turismo, Forza, or Rfactor either. Users of steering setups like Logitech's G27 can expect to use all 3 pedals if they so choose. I personally made use of the 360 controller for pc, and while it wasn't as perfect as a wheel could be, I did fairly well. Controller users, expect some slight difficulty shifting in default controls. Using the Right analog stick up and down as sequential shifting works well enough until you need to reverse. Likewise, don't expect to be precise on throttle and brake using the left and right triggers. The boost button is the ""A"" button, which means boosting as you shift WILL be awkward and slow you down. Having one of the wheels is definitely going to be a better experience in fun and outright skill.As far as tuning your vehicles go, expect more ""MMO"", less ""simulation"" and ""racing"". For example, I completed a quick event while cruising and got a new ECU. it added +2 to braking. When you buy your car and it's considered ""full stock"", you will see some real stats: Torque, max speed,  weight, drivetrain layout, 0-60 time. Once you begin upgrading it however, those will be replaced bby more MMO styled representations. My 370Z car in ""Street"" spec had a speed of 63xx, and after getting various unlocks, it ended up around 66xx. This may seem confusing, and I apologize if my description has lost you. Here's the bottom line: DO NOT EXPECT YOUR CAR TO HANDLE WITH SPECIFIC INPUTS AS IF THIS IS FORZA OR GT. The game definitely caters more to the feel/perception of driving than the technical  know-how and experience.*Note I've only played GT5, which is a decent ""sim"" for consoles, but  probably isn't the most in-depth driving sim either. It is a good comparison to this game and Burnout Paradise though.*Viisually, car mods are well done. Swap bumpers, hoods, trunk spoilers, interior material, and paint. Bonus points for rally lights and snorkels for ""Dirt"" spec cars. Each part and sticker fits right. The cars are simply beautiful to look at. As you get damaged, paint scrrapes off, bumpers begin to hang off, glass gets cracked. Did you drive off-road? you've probably collected some mud.So, the game's called ""The Crew"". Where's said crew? (Multiplay)If you see a player you want to crew with, simply bring the menu up, select their trading card, and invite them. Once in a crew, the whole team (up to 4) can do most single-play events. If one player wins it, the whole team wins it. Got a friend that loves off-road, and another that specializes in hitting the apex on a hill climb or track? the off-road guy can do track events with the track guy. Team wins, off-roader can move on. Same with the track nut being able to sort of get carried through off-road events. The notes are true: *no* load times. You can drive from Detroit to San Fran without seeing a load screen. ***Except for  a noticable 2-6 seconds transition to and from map screen. So what happens when you are in Detroit and your friends are already in San Fran? Well, if you've been to the spot they are at, you can simply fast travel directly on top of them. Otherwise, unfortunately, you guys have a bit of a drive to meet up unless you take a bus or plane. For better or worse, you can't see every player that is online in your world. the game seems to split players into ""Sessions"". You can freely see players on your map if they are in your session. Whether your friends are in your session or not, you can crew with them. Animals and perhaps other things aren't synced. A friend was running over some boars in a forest while I watched him do donuts in an open field. Weather does seem to be synced though.I tried to cover some of the technical aspects above. Driving physics and handling, the open world aspect, and multiplay.The truth is, I had a fun time being in a crew with 2 friends, and going from meeting them near Laguna Seca, to driving for 20 minutes sowe could hit Pike's Peak. Yes, there's  a single player story revolving around underground street racing and gang drama...but what I and my friends enjoyed most, was getting in our cars, and just driving. I was using a Ford Focus, while my friends were using a Dodge Charger and a Ford Mustang. As we were traveling, I had to really struggle at times to keep them in my view. My god it was glorious. Sometimes they let off the throttle, or we paused to swap to different cars. After switching to my street car (370z) I was able to keep good pace and even pass them. At that point, we were able to just trail each other closely. Buy/consider  this game if:-You enjoy driving just to cruise. (Part of the charm is the 20 min drive)-You don't need/want very technical, realistic driving. OR You don't mind a driving game with somewhat..exaggerated characteristics.-You like open world games-You like cars-MMO/RPG type progression is ok to you: redoing missions for more XP/cash, less than accurate tuning( see above for ECU adding +2 to braking stat )- Simply looking for another game to use that steering wheel/pedal/shifter set for.Maybe skip the game if:-the idea of an always-online game isn't fun to you- You need/strongly desire simulation/realistic handling, roads, etc. The game makes some heavy compromises in each area.-You prefer more traditional racing, such as Forza and GT for track racing; Colin McRae/Dirt for Rally/ light off-roading.-you hate Uplay. (I had some very damning problems separate from the game)-Not a fan of MMO's or grinding to level up the player or cars.-You don't really want to use peripherals like a steering wheel, or analog controller. Like a real car, slight throttle, brake, and steering inputs will be the difference between a smooth drive and constantly smacking cars and guard rails.			",110,12,2,3,7,1,10

												The game is quite fun, and I have spent many hours in it, and will probably spend more too. However... there are some pretty big caveats to this. The price for one; I have the Australia tax, and the base game costs $75USD, not including the exchange rate and everything. Then there is the DLC - each one is a pack of 4 extra cars, hardly worth the price considering they don't really offer too much more. And then there are the Mi-crew-transactions. Seriously? Extra in-game micro transactions on an already pretty pricey Triple A release? There are two different forms of currency in-game, one which is solely earnt through missions, skills, and stunts. And then there are CREW CREDITS. You are given 100,000 reasonably early on in the game, but that's not enough for anything good. And so... you are invited to use real life money to purchase these in order to quickly obtain cars or specs that you would otherwise spend countless hours grinding for. The grind for this game is pretty ridiculous - not only do you have to grind for in-game cash (unless you pay real money) for the cars, but then, upgrade those cars, you must complete skill challenges to acquire parts to improve your car... for each individual car. The best parts are also RNG based, so you could easily spend hours farming the same challenge to try and get that specific part you wanted.In contrast to some others, I've had no issues with Uplay, but this could just mean I'm one of the lucky ones. Unlike some of the Trailers, the world isn't as filled - this is both a good and bad thing. If you like PVP, well, you'll be in for a long wait. But otherwise, the comparative lack of players is actually a bit of a blessing in disguise. Particularly if you are farming money or parts, the smaller population sizes actually makes it much easier to do what you want without getting in each other's way, which is extremely inconvenient and can be extremely aggravating. One of the biggest draws, the co-op, doesn't really seem to work completely as well, sometimes crews doing a mission won't finish properly. That said, it is still incredibly awesome to drive around America with a group of friends, or accept a random online invite if you prefer that instead. There can, however, still be connection issues even within a crew, so that is something to keep in mind if you plan on primarily playing the game in multiplayer. You'll also want to do this with a friend, playing with strangers online can be dicey and very hit and miss.The campaign is pretty standard and boring despite how short it is - done and dusted in about 7 or 8 hours. The campaign really offers nothing new, interesting, or relevant. It's very cliche with some pretty glaring plot holes. I enjoyed cruising around the map in free roam doing whatever I wanted more than completing the campaign.This brings me to by far, the best part of the game - the world map. The Drive is the best open world driving experience I've had by far, with you literally able to drive from Canada to Mexico and coast to coast with an incredibly diverse environment to explore, with vast tracks of open road and off road land to discover. Many cities are either scaled down or removed completely, understandable but potentially annoying to some - I never had an issue with it, it would not make sense to make everything completely to scale. The exploration of the map is great, although sometimes the game feels more like a tourist guide... noting landmarks like the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam. Regardless, the environments are fantastic, from the dense urban cities of Los Angeles and New York, to snowy mountains, deserts, and swamps. The time and environmental system in The Crew is also well worth talking about. From snow, rain, cloud, and sun, the weather is quite well, although rain does not affect driving as much as it should. The day/night system is a highlight, although sometimes streetlamps and headlights turn on and off at weird times... The poor standard of NPC traffic is a let-down. Not only in terms of how they look, but also in terms of how they spawn and despawn. I understand that this is to reduce the stress of the game, but it still looks odd to see other vehicles randomly appearing or vanishing, especially at night time, where headlights are the only thing which shows other road users.Now to the gameplay. The driving and racing offers nothing spectacular, although the game's physics and hit boxes are inconsistent. On one hand, it's pretty good to see a driving game where your car accumulates visible damage. However, repair prices are exorbitant, and the damage does not seem to effect the car's performance. Then there are odd times where you hit another car or object... sometimes you get the ""crash cam"", sometimes you spin to the side, sometimes you flip, sometimes you are bumped backwards or sideways... but there doesn't seem to be much  consistency. And sometimes you'll be sent flying over rocks or curbs through invisible walls. It can be entertaining to see your million-dollar car flip and tumble... but also frustrating and physically wrong. I feel the handling is quite poor in the game, with strangely large turning circles, the surprisingly high propensity to skid (not drift), something exacerbated off-road. Landing after jumps is also poorly handled, and you always land nose first, generally but not always, causing you flip and crash.There isn't too much racing in this game, with a variety of other missions such as ""disable"" or ""deliver"", but the game's AI is very frustrating and completely unrealistic. Regardless of how your car is upgraded, the AI will always be right on your tail. Collisions will ALWAYS affect you more negatively than the other car hit, regardless of whether it's a race or police pursuit, and who intitiated the contact. And the police pursuits are not fun either. Pursuits only start if you hit a street lamp, but you will be ignored if you speed through a red light at four times the speed limit past a police car? And then, when the pursuit starts, it's actually quite impractical to see the police cars catch up to you... it just doesn't make sense that a random squad car could catch up to a supercar and then insta-stop and bust you. The speed with which you get caught, and subsequently the amount you get fined, make police pursuits far more trouble than fun. The traffic can also behave oddly, especially at lights and when merging.And then, finally, the cars themselves. I really love the fact that most of the cars are licensed, and have official paints, rims, etc. There are exceptions though, such as the two RUF cars. The stature of the cars is further refined by the 5 different classes, or specs - Street, Dirt, Performance, Race, Circuit - which are all noticeably different to each other, in both looks and performance. This is in contrast to some other games, where differences such as Rally or Muscle cars actually really don't offer much difference in terms of gameplay. In The Crew, the different classes all have their own strengths and weaknesses, and perform differently. Even with the classes, however, the selection of cars is really quite limited, especially if you do not purchase the DLC. While there is a reasonably large range of physical modifications available (bumpers, hoods, spoilers, etc.), these customisation options lack depth and are limited. And some, like the license plates, are barely noticeable. That said, you are able to do some incredibly fun and potentially silly things. Like drive a Mini Cooper down a ski ramp like THE STIG, or hit 300km/h in a Fiat or Dodge SRT.It's months post release, but there are still bugs  - getting stuck or going through environmental hazards, , and graphical glitches where roads vanish or turn strange colours... Don't get me wrong, I enjoy The Crew, and it isn't bad, per se, but it's hard to justify the price, especially with microtransactions thrown in.			",802,140,28,161,113,7,224

												I've played since the first beta, both open and closed beta.  I know you're worried about it being Ubisoft - no worries, it's flawless.  I'm 30 years old.  I've been playing racing games since Pole Position in the 1980s on my Mac.  I've played everything from the 1990s hit Gran Turismo 1 to the brand new Mario Kart 8 on Wii U.  Simply put, The Crew is one of my favorite racing games ever.  It is a unique racing MMORPG like none other. Freakin' massive, gorgous, and varied open world to explore, the best open world since Skyrim. Tons of players everywhere. Nice co-op and PvP. Lots of different and varied missions/quests all over. Surprisingly decent story about gangs and the FBI. Tons of things to level up and customzie. Incredible graphics, one of the best looking games period. Tight and responsive controls that work perfectly. Very unique and just what racing games needed. Any fan of racing/driving must check this out, it's much better than I expected it to be. The game runs absolutely flawlessly with not a single bug in sight.  You can spend hours not doing any missions and just driving around and soaking in the world.  It's  racing game with the addictiveness of an MMORPG and it's is very hard to stop playing.  I can see this game eating hundreds of hours of my free time.9/10 -  Does it have flaws?  Sure but they are nothing major that prevents the game from being a blast.  It combines the best of the best of the best racing games.  Gran Turnismo, DiRT, Hot Purtsuit, and too many to name.  The Crew is the  biggest surprise in many years.  An abolsute must buy for any racing fan. The Crew isn't just a good racing game, it's a good game period.			",624,183,21,54,43,9,54

The Game is now released and out of Beta so time for an updated review. The handling is going to take some getting used to coming from a game like iRacing, the game looks great and feels good too. My computer did not even break a sweat running it!So far I have enjoyed my gameplay time with the Crew, but it has been rather rough ride now I am a Crew fan boy but will speak honestly about the game.There is plenty of places to drive to, with lots of streets to cover, all the locations and streets have real names which adds to the fun. There are alot of skill missions to do.Crew up is fun and is always good laugh, but sometimes has issue'sI was very happy to see it worked straight away with my G27 wheel and clubsport elite pedals which was mainly what i was worried about.

There are some cons,  the voice over sounds alot like Aiden Pearce from watchdogs, no mirrors lol, what car game doesn't have mirrors maybe they thought everyone would spend the race in last so they were not needed, level 50 max level you will reach which took me 10 hours, the story is built on very basic foundation.Steering feels good but does take little messing around to find sweet spot, I can't complain too much but it reminds me alot of TDU2, its all in finding the right settings.I have a modified FFB G27 with bigger motors and I had the FFB slider on full, this almost broke my damn fingers, lots of colourful language came out then.My overall thoughts this game has average content to offer one the story is complete your left with not much but skill missions which get old really quick, my concern for this game is the future they have plans for more car DLC but not alot to do with the cars, this game is good for car person such as myself but casual gamer may get bored pretty quick.

												Its time for me to write my very first Review, and its going to be about The Crew.This, was a fun game with a lot of potential, but Team Ubi and Ivory Tower Turned it into... well, into what it is now,I've spent some hours on it, there are ppl with more hours than me but anyway, people might think that somebody with a lot of time spent on a game would obviously recommend itbut thing is, i saw it going down slowly... and the potential got wasted.First lets state the important and obvious details about this game:Not sure if i should list this as pros and cons, so i'll just list the good and bad about each feature:-Specs: This is of the main features of this game, i even dare to say its the core to the crew's gameplay, when i just played it, it was cool as you see when you pick your first vehicle, you can have every spec on that vehicle, That being, Street, Dirt, Perf, Raid and Circuit(drag, drift and Monster truck if you have WR Expansion but i'll get to that later), but as you progress in the game you start noticing that its only incomplete, while this is indeed a cool feature, its quite lacking, most of the vehicles in the game only come in Perf spec, wich is annoying, yeah, we get it, not anybody would turn a Lamborghini Aventador into a raid vehicle, but thats the fun part of a video game, do things you can't do in real life, So, as for the specs, i find it quite lacking, specially because some of my favorite vehicles only come in one spec... -Customization: When this game came out, there wasn't a lot of racing games with this option, So this was a nice adition to someone's library who is looking for a nice racing game with this feature, while its not perfect, its decent, but as i said, its not perfect, why? first, choosing the color, you have to choose from an already existing color list, if your favorite color is not there, you are screwed, the parts you can choose from, some are nice, but i wish they were better, you can't choose  your wheels color, customization parts are only for Street, Dirt, and Performance specs, Raid and Circuit, you can only change paint, decals and wheels, there are some elements on the customization menu that are actually empty and only makes you wonder why the heck are they there?? like the Fender one, That being said, Customization is there, it sorta do its part, but i just wish it was way better, like letting you blend your own paint, put the materials you wish on whatever part you wish, etc.-Graphics and optimization: The graphics are not top notch but for me, they were enough to say it looks good, specially after the visual overhaul they did, not much else to say. As for the optimization, it sucks, there are graphic glitches that are still there from the very beggining of the game,like the stuttering, doesn't matter how amazing or beefy its your computer, it will ALWAYS stutter and have fps drops randomly.-Gameplay: a lot of people find it bad, it feels stiff, clunky or whatever, as for me, its good, the controls are not that bad, the races andevents are good(but quite lacking...) the physics are quite odd but not odd enough to ruin the game, the best part of the gameplay? you have a really big world to play, the bad part of it? the devs were lazy enough to cover all that ground with all kind of events and racing tracks, instead, they added a game mode where players can create their own races, wich its not that bad, but not that good either, a poor excuse to cut work and let players do the devs work.So, overall, the gameplay its just Decent.-PvP: while i have'nt spend a lot of time on pvp, i can say that its only for those with very good conection, or else you will just get glitchy af races with oddly moving trafic, pvp its indeed one of the main features of the gameplay, and at first it was amazing, but with time less and less players were available to play with, it still have a good playerbase but still  feels a bit dead sometimes, cant really say much about pvp so i'll just leave it on NeutralAnd now comes the fun part: the dlcs-Wild Run: To me it was a nice addition with a lot of potential in the beggining, why? cuz it would keep new vehicles coming monthly to the game, so it was worth it a try, also, it came with new Specs, Drift, Drag and MT, new events, wich could get better with time, but actually didn't, at first, new vehicles were suposed to come montly, then, every 2 months, now, 3 months, wich sucks, each summit event its the same and the same, the yjust repeat it on different days, never updated it, and now, the just announced that they wont be rewarding new vehicles on the montly summit, they will just reward already existing vehicles, as for players who already have those, we have nothing else to do in the summit.The extreme specs are also lacking, why? only a few vehicles can have SOME of them, and most are badly designed, why? i'll just say this, you can't have a drag classic muscle car, and honestly, classic muscle cars are meant to be drag cars... Drift, can't really be done outside of the summit, you can play with drift spec, but no point to it, there are not a lot of drift events you can play multiplayer.MT, same as drift. Seriously, they didn't think about adding cool MT races on the mountains or smething? Overall, WR HAD a lot of potential, that got wasted over time, as of now, its just bad.-Calling all units: when they first announced this, it was a good addition to the game, when it came out, it was the typical McDonalds burger Meme, its not as good as they made it sound.The Story mode for CaU is there, pontless, but its there, the new character, Clara, sounds like unmotivated dubbing actress(or actor...) who only knows how to speak with sarcasm, the story misions are just boring and pointless.The Police SPec its completely lacking, only a very small slection of police vehicles its available, its not that hard to add every single spec available in this game into the police lineup, they just needed to add the paint job to the existing body kits and add some police lights... but that would mean work for the devs so screw it. Currently, there are only a few police players, mainly because not a lof of ppl bought the EP, wich i'd say it was wise.The crate events are quite boring without police players to chase you, and reward you vehicles that you can buy with ingame money, again if you have every vehcle, this is a pointless activity.Skills, are there, they do what they are suposed to do, but not a big addition to the game.The new vehicles are only a few, and also, made me angry about them, if u had complete edition or something similar before CaU release, you just got a Nissan GTR that anybody could get, and a Lambo Huracan that now EVERYONE can use, no longer require CaU, so, basically, you could wear a T-Shirt saying ""i gave the devs al ot of money and all i got was this ♥♥♥♥"".So, in the end, why can't i recommed this game? in its current state, it feels lacking and incomplet, it gives the feeling that they just starting to not give a ""turd"" about this game anymore, so if they dont care, we should stop giving them money.TL;DR This game had potential, that they never developed at its fullest,now its just plain boring and feels like an incomplete game.This is not a definitive review, might change over time, but as of now, i dont suggest to buy this game, get it if its on sale, like 50% off or something, its not worth its price, don't buy half game for a full game price...

												Dont buy it. Dont make the mistake i made.-Cars handle like driving on soap with no difference between fourwheel, rearwheel or frontwheel. It literally makes no difference. I did a burnout with the rear wheels in a Ford Focus.-No character development. It tries really hard to sell you a dramatic tone but doesnt even touches on bonding with the npcs. Every mission feels like a chore with dull dialog, repetitive gameplay and all around cliche premises.Simply the worst, most overhyped piece of garbage I have ever laid hands on.P.S.

												I enjoy this game immensly, its a great game. great graphics, great fun to just drive around and explore. HOWEVER, I bought the gold edition when it came out, which included the season pass. but DIDN'T include the Wild Run DLC. which, frankly, is stupid. almost ALL new actual content, that would keep me playing the game for things other than just driving around, is in Wild Run. Dropping more money into a game to get something that should of come with the season pass is just discusting business practice. though, we all know how much to expect from ubisoft.however, don't let that prevent you from enjoying what is, actually, a really good game. I still manage to have hours of fun in it, literally just driving around exploring the absolutely MASSIVE map. even after I think I've driven around the whole thing, I have still missed spots. And you get a few good hours out of the story, so what I did buy was worth it, even without wild run. I would buy Wild Run if you were getting it now though, because thats where all the stuff to do is.EDIT: One other thing I would like to add, This game is what? 2+ years old now? its still getting regular updates, which is actually seriously good, especially for something by Ubisoft.

												Graphics: 8/10, and pretty well optimized.Everyone seems to be complaining about the handling, which I thought to be pretty okay, though I have next to no experience with racing/car games, so I can't say much.Was fun until I realized that much of the online content, tuners, vehicles, races, events, and just about every other aspect must be unlocked with DLC, which is shoved down your throat at every possible moment. Why show events on the map that players can't participate in?Overall: a nice, cool, 3/10.			",54,7,0,3,5,0,2

												Im rating this as a positive review because i had alot of fun at first.I really like car games, however, the crew does not have even remotely realistic physics. If you are looking for a game that is even slightly realistic, I urge you, go elsewhere. If you are looking for an openworld cruising/racing arcade style car game, this may be fun for you.There are so many problems in this game that I am not going to list them all but here are some of them:      a)Cars feel like they are floating through corners, drifting is nearly impossible even with a drift kit (you have to buy one before you can drift for more than a few feet) due to the fact that the game doesnt rely on a realistic physics engine for drifting, i.e. loss of traction to the rear wheels (or all four for AWD) instead it chooses a 'brake to drift' style, simply turn and hope for the best.      b) Cars take forever to upgrade, and the process isnt exciting, you simply do a single jump over and over, 10s of 100s of times, untill you get what parts you want. This process is comepletely random, no matter how skilled you are at the game or how high of a score you get, you will get the same thing, at total random.      c) The Physics for offroading and jumps is absolutely trash. You can flip your car at the slightest provocation, and it is not consistent at all. One second, you can drive right over a large boulder with ease. The very next second, a tiny rock will somehow flip your whole car. Also, you cannot continue to roll back over while still in the air (barrel roll), so if the car flips it counts as a wreck, even if you would have landed correctly.Honestly, if you like car games that give you control over your car, wait for Forza Horizon 3. Its just over a month and a half away. do yourself a favor here.			",95,2,4,8,5,0,5

												It's a Ubi game, so you kind of expect half truths and a dumbing down of everything they spewed that would be in the game. Ubi is also extremely good at the DLC season pass scam on all their games. Content that was promised at the start always turns up in the second year after seasons pass is gone.As for the game, I played back at launch and when I went back in recently I found they have really slowed progression in the game to the point it is just a grinder now.Big company that has mastered the scam of DLC.

												Well, as I had been waiting for this ever since it was announced, I obviously bought the Gold Edition of the game. Just because the game was looking really interesting and something that I could spend hours on, just by looking at the videos, screenshots, etc of the game.I took my time with the story, I didn't want to rush it, just because there was so much other stuff to do around the world (exploring, skill challenges, side missions and so on) but eventually, when I completed the story, I pretty much stopped playing the game. I had already seen pretty much everything the game had to offer, the missions and everything just kinda became repetive. Of course the exploration part was still there in the game, as the map is massive so it's going to take a good while to explore the whole map, but as much I did enjoy driving around in the game, I just couldn't find the interest in exploring the whole map.Here's a list of the pros and cons in the game, and then in the end of the review, a small summary.Pros- Decent graphics- 5 different specs available for vehicles in the game (Not every car has all of the specs, though)- Big map- Interesting story- Decently made cars- Good amount of music in the game- Good performance- Amazingly detailed interiors in vehicles- Ingame awards- PVP events- Decent handling (A lot of people have said that the handling is bad, but in my opinion, it's pretty decent)- Good car customization options  - There could be more customization options in the game, but the ones that are in the game work just fine when customizing a vehicleCons:- Short story (Even though it was interesting, it still was short)- Crew Credits (You don't need to buy these (with real money) in order to progress quicker in the game, but they do help you a lot if you want to buy that Lamborghini quickly and not spend a few hours farming money to get it)- Crash cutscenes are horrible- The AI  - Opponent AI is impossible, when your car level is 1299 and their car level is 299, they still catch up to you in a second and are always right behind you  - Traffic AI can be pretty buggy sometimes- uPlay  - I would be so much happier if they could just ditch uPlay and move it to Steam. Probably one of the biggest problems that I have with uPlay is that when I open the ingame overlay, it freezes the gameOverall, I have to recommend the game. Even though it has a lot of bad things in it, it's still a pretty damn good game for people who enjoy games like this. I had a lot of fun playing the game, even with the problems it had.So, should you buy this game?Yes, if.. You enjoy games like Test Drive Unlimited 2 or Driver San Francisco and you want to spend that 50€-75€ (depending on if you buy the Gold Edition or the Stock Edition + Season Pass or just the Stock Edition) on the game, but I'd recommend buying this when it's on a sale rather than paying the full price for it.No, if.. You're into realistic racing simulators, this is not one of them.EDIT: Review updated since a lot of cons have been fixed.			",557,100,50,38,89,0,46

												I will recommend this game but read carefully!As always, i read most helpful not recommended reviews and i will try to sum them up here.My opinion: Huge map is tolerating all the cons of this game. I am just happy about crusing around.Cons:Server issues happens sometime and game does not start at allThe wild run expansion changes the game a little bit even you do not have it, but when you see an event and try to enter, message says you have to install wild run. This is ridicuolus.The concept is wonderful. having a crew to compete against others is what makes racing fun. But there is not much reason to look for players on the map because most online players are busy with PVP events. And the story is not urging you to play as a group. Good concept, bad execution.PVP events (online races) are open to everyone and if you have not completed most of the game you will most probably be beaten to smoke. Cuz you will not have platinum parts from skills on the map and therefore other players with platinum parts will be flying away from you. This could be understandable, if there were a proper match making algorithm.Physics are not realistic, mostly like an arcade game.There are weird glitches like flying to the moon all of a sudden.And i do not see any other flaws in the game. Here are the pros:The map is huge and the visuals are aweome. (Some optimizations could be better)The soundtrack in missions are awesome but they do not play in freeroam. You have to listen to radio in freeroam. Radio contains classical music, ambient music, rap, rock, electornic... A wide range.Story is easy because most of the time, you are given a car to ride. so you do not have to have an expensive car in your pocket all the time. And when you need one, there are like a hundred of different skill actions which gives you new parts.Physics are weird for a racing game but just right for an open world game. This is not a simulation. Remember Need for Speed Most Wanted from 2006. The physics reminds me of that game, and it was too an amazing game.5 different camera angels are all yours to select. Some games has only 2.Cars are divided into multiple types. So you can go off road with a dirt car or completely out into the wild with a raid car. You can have a hypercar (performance car) to travel in light speed. I actually do not understand the Street cars :D Circuit cars are ideal for point to point agile drivng. How much more diversity do you want?There is a faction system, which is kind of a mafia wars over the whole map, but it does not much mean to belong to one faction. This is a good idea but no one cares about it.There are faction races to increase your factions reputation. These races can be less than 10 mins or longer than an hour. There are two particular races, one is like 3.5 hours long dirt race and the other is a 2 hours long performance race. BTW, this was my childhood dream. An hours long race which does not involve looping the same track.So if you do not mind some server issues, sloppy physics, out of the concept gameplay and some glitches, this game is a great openworld racing game.

												This game is great if you want to explore a massive and detailed open world. I would say the map is about 5 times as large as gta 5's and is about a dense but there are no interactions with pedestrians and you are restricted to just your car.

												corners were cut, drastically. im not even gonna bother writing an actual review since all the reviews under most helpful are quite literally on point. the game needs more cars, period. how can you have cars be customizable for dirt and not have a subaru or evo? you have an f150 but no cars that people actually tune in real life?THIS IS NOT A RACING GAME. IT IS A MMO WITH CARS. races arent races theyre point a to b and no matter how good you are and dont crash or spinout (which btw is very hard to do with the crappy handling) the other cars are still right behind you. cant tell you how many times ive gotten to the end of a mission and a car/school bus spawns right in front of me and i crash and lose the faction misson ive been working on for the last 2 1/2 hours.  buy this game if its on sale dont pay full price for this uncompleted game. i got it for 40$ and change and its barely worth the money. its a good game to screw around in. and as far as the season pass goes, if youre gonna buy the game might as well get the season pass. otherwise youll be stuck in your first car for a while. only way to win decent money is faction missions. story missions barely give you 2k and an r34 costs over $100,000? okay buddyI REALLLLLLYYY wanted to love this game but unfortunately as everything ubisoft has had their name on lately, its a disappointment			",67,7,7,5,8,0,5

												This was one of the games I was looking foward to this year. But it does so little in the areas where it matters most that it falls short of where other existing games pass with flying colors.Sure I love the visuals of the game and it plays decently well, but the focus of the game is cars and... There's quite a lack of focus in general on them. From what I can see, there's only 40 cars that you can get from dealerships yet this game has one problem that a lot of these style of games have. They tend to favour one or two manufacturers over the rest and that leaves the variety pretty thin, especially when you only have 40 cars and around 1/7th of them are Fords.Another thing is customization. If you wanted to make awesome murals or just a silly paintjob for your ride, I got two words for you, ""You can't"". The customization feels like it came right from need for speed most wanted (2005) but with even less content then you would even think of. I can't even change the color of my Dodge Viper since there's only 1 color for it and it's terrible.That's another thing. Everytime I get a racing game, I make it a personal objective to get a Dodge Viper because who doesn't strive to earn their favorite car? But I practically started off with it. You can't buy it but instead, use Uplay award points to buy it and then BAM! Instant car... I already feel like I have nothing to work towards in the game now and I only just started it...In comparison to Test Drive Unlimited 2. This game has much greater visuals and world design and also doesn't have those annoying houses that make it take forever to manage your cars. But lacks in everywhere else like car selection veriaty, customization and pay to win mechanics. Yes, this game has paid for currency in it which you can use to buy skill points that give passive benefits to your stats or immediate access to any car.			",255,13,10,19,28,2,33

												There will be no objectivity in this review, just my opinion on THIS stuff.First question for now is ""what the hell?"" I preordered this game in 2014 with season pass, I was waiting for it, it was something new to me, just whoah, look, you can drive through all the USA(okay, almost all). After release I played about 60 hrs and then gave up, because I bought and upgraded all the cars I wanted to 1299, after this it was nothing to do anymore. Between this time and WR release I entered The Crew couple of times just to check new cars(imho there are not so good to buy season pass).Wild Run. Okay, when I was watching all these trailers, reading news I thought ""okay, this can be really interesting"", but after WR release I understood, that all my thoughts were... wrong. Three new useless types of cars? Really, anyone used them anywhere except summit challenges? I haven't ever seen someone was driving through on drift or dragster or monster truck. I played in WR, participated in summit, even won something but I was still asking myself: ""really, i paid for this??"" Maybe I didn't know about some features?Calling All Units. I thought I won't have to pay for it *sigh* And I will NOT buy this, because it's just stupid. I preordered The Crew+SP, bought WR and now I need to buy CAU. And also I'm offered to buy Ultimate version which is much cheaper than buying The Crew+SP, then WR and then CAU. Nice job, well done, good game :/ Okay, we got it. But it's not all. Where's my lambo Huracan? I can't see her in my garage. Is it so hard just to add one car to ""veteran"" players? And why the hell I can be arrested when cop is driving near me with the same speed? Some guy arrested me on 200+ km/h... Just what? It's not funny, even if you are a cop.So, we got(imho) useless Season Pass, useless WIld Run and Calling All Units, not useless, but though I'm not sure after what happened. I am very dissapointed. The Crew had great potential, but Ivory Tower(or maybe its Ubi fault, don't know) think in another way. Yes, it was fun to travel around the USA, but without these DLCs game feels incomplete. That's not the way how it should work.P.S. optimization on PC isn't good at all too.			",139,30,10,16,29,0,11

												The Idea is neat, but the execution could have been better.The Crew expects you to grind, with more of the racing part feeling uninspiring and disconnected , But the FreeRoam is what  makes it Damn Good. You can Drive Cross-country and like in reality, You'd actually stop and take pictures. Not sure what other game makes people do this.+ Huge World to explore.+ Free Roam mode.++++Cockpit View.+++++ Photo mode+ Plenty of Cars/ Bikes with different specs.+ Weather system.+ Events/modes.+ NOW FREE ON UBISTORE [ Limited time, although i bought it on steam]+ Dev Support, after all these years, new content coming.+- An MMO ??!! PvP matches need better matchmaking(or needs to force a common level of cars for all players), oh and kids, learn to drive without pushing other people. This pushing is 90% of PvP. +- Controls need tweaking, a bit of manual modding and it's a lotta fun. +- A texture update would do wonders [fully maxed and some areas are just flat, but i guess its showing its age]- Story- Disconected Racing experience- DLCs [guess the new cops and robbers dlc might change that]- Grind for upgrades.- AIDont be thrown off by the negative reviews, most are from people who dont know to activate the steam bought version in Uplay. And i've never had any issues with Uplay whatsoever or these supposed glitches everyone keeps saying about the game. Some reviews are just plain mundane and pointless, and others disliking it after playing a good deal of hours. Real mature, people. I play this game mostly for fun and relaxation, and sometimes the races, Most times exploring the map in freeroam listening to trance music. Driving at daybreak(in cockpit view ofc) on the interstate in a Lamborghini and seeing the sun rise between the mountains or drifting up an icy mountain off road and reaching the top is just a great feeling. I honestly expect the game to be revived next year as a good  racing   Driving sim title in steam.i give it a 7/10 now and an 8/10 after the new dlc releases. More stuff to do. Hopefully.

Driving and diving / Ecco the GolfinI've grown to love The Crew.I play it like an underwater diving game, only on land. Turn on the soapy ingame ambient radio. Dial down the engine sounds. Switch off the player tag cloud that shows which people are nearby. Mark a place on the map I want to go to.And then it's just peaceful gliding through landscapes of varying quality. Some are blander than others, sometimes the trees look like big matches stuck in the ground. I mostly enjoy the different kitschy light situations. Sunrise, sundown, The Crew's sun always finds new ways to surprise me and to colour everything in different ways.The MMO part, or let's say, the social component, seems like a total failure to me. I never saw anybody use the chat, unlike in TDU2, where people would often park their cars somewhere and have little group conversations that made it clear there were actual people in these cars. The only human contact I had during my 30 hours with The Crew was players trying to ram me into oblivion.Maybe it's my fault, but whilst TDU2 was The Sims on wheels,  The Crew seems to attract a crowd that's more into, well, driving, not chatting. That's okay, I guess.I enjoy driving. I wish more of my friends on Steam would take the plunge, but then again, driving around together could be very boring, I don't know? I suppose one has to be a proper bore to find diving-driving interesting.I play The Crew to relax and the game is successful at that.			",99,115,11,35,6,1,8

(since tdu 2 launched in 2011).I had bought this game on a sale a few days ago,plaied almost 30 hours straight and from the experience i got in the game i can assure you about the next things:1.No crashes(i don't know if u have crashes,your PC is the problem)2.No bugs,i haven't fell trough map not even once,neither glitched into a wall or something3.There are still pretty many people online out there...i tought it would be worse4.No one talks about the free graphic ,,DLC"" wich ubisoft gave us for free! i have had only plaied this game when it was on beta in the summer of 2014 and i saw a lot of improvements,not to mention how awesome the car responds at all the commands.With that being,said i hope you enjoied my review and that i have opened your eyes about this game a bit and that maybe you will buy it and we'll play togather ! :D (sorry for wrong spelled words,i'm not native english)			",101,6,3,11,5,0,2

												I don't think this game deserves that much negative criticism, I really like it, it's one of the only games of this type. The problem is Ubisoft's dodgy practice. The game has 1 expansion pack (at time of writing) and a few more DLCs. I own the very basic version, no expansion, no DLC and I can say that the after-game content is pretty lacking, all that is left to do is re-do some story missions to get better parts, do faction missions, PvP and that's about it without the expansion.Update: So as you may know, the Calling All Units expansion has been released and everyone gets something. Level cap has been increased to 60, performance cap has been increased to 1497, there are now more events to do, specifically crate runs. A nice addition is the fragment system, you need to get 10 fragments to unlock a car, you can get them from doing the crate runs. Platinum crates have a 100% chance of dropping a fragment.

 This game will annoy you and hit every single nerve. You have been warned. For easily driving around with all freedom in the world, this is it. For a realistic game get NFS.What I just said I did not just say lightly. I like this game, I do. But in the 5 hours I have played this game so far (In one sitting) I have been so insanely upset and happy at the same time, I still don't know what to feel.You might ask now: What? How's that possible? Should I buy this now or na?Well, let me get to that for you now:If the game is on sale, YES. Get it. Own it. If not, then don't waste your money. (I paid 30€ for the Complete Edition and I do not regret it.)The first thing I can tell you is the handling is something you will HAVE to get used to. I played Need For Speed 2016 before this, so I was used to something more accurate. But the Handling in this game feels so heavy. Too heavy. But taking curves is fairiyl easy and makes fun.Offroad it is really easy to slide around corner and get overtaken by AI in every single race, but on the street it's much more difficult to steer. Irony, right?The handling in this game isn't great, that's obvious. But it's not the worst, either. After 5h I have gotten used to it and no longer get upset because of it. I'm sure if you get into the game even more you won't even notice it. It sure as hell doesn't make the whole game bad though.Depending on what vehicle you use, the handling should change, but it doesn't really. Even lighter cars still feel heavy. Bikes on the other hand feel much more comfortable and I actually prefer riding them.The drifting is great though, offroad and on the street. No arguments.Like I said, I played NFS2016 before this, and I can tell you something now.If you want a realistic racing game, that challenges you in every turn, is accurate with every car and requires skill and thought, get NFS. It's not just the realistic graphics and models, but the insanely good handling and difference with every car. It requires you to sit down and study it. It's Need for Speed. There's not much more to say, I loved it. The Crew on the other hand is different.It's not as realistic, the graphics are lower and the handling is a lot different. So, why should I even consider The Crew over NFS? Both MP and SP and both racing games.Well, no. NFS is good, really good. But like I said, it needs time and liking and skill. It's not something for everyone.While with The Crew you don't need to worry about your Computer Specs or low framerate. No need to study the game and learn how to drive every corner. Also; you can specialize on off-Road or Dragrace or whatever.In NFS, you can't. I like the Crew because it's a game for everyone. You can costumize your cars to whatever your prefered style is:Dragrace, Drifting, Performance, Street, Offroad, Monster Trucks, etc. In NFS, it's just street racing. But it's perfect. You see?Need for Speed is the ultimate Racing game because all you do is Race.In The Crew you do much more. You can specialize your vehicles and try different kinds of races, different spcialized enemies and upgrade them accordingly.The little challenges on your way help you improve your Parts and even get your amazing stuff for finishing it. Whenever you ride a road with a challenge twice, you always do the challenge. No matter what.NFS's tuning is detailed and thought through. You gotta see what parts fit and earn them.In The Crew you literally get them thrown in behind you. They fit your vehicle.And this is great. You can level easily and get good parts without having to win any races. Now, Pro's and Con's:Pro:- Huge World- Specialized Vehicle Costumization- A lot of Vehicles- Bikes- Easy to get into- A lot of small & big things to do- The sounds are actually good and don't cause earcancerCon's:- Not too good graphics- The god damn handling- AI- AI- AI- Did I mention AI?Now, AI. Yes, yes, yes. I HATE IT. Why? let me explain to you, my friend.So, in the beginning I chose wisely what veicle I chose and what parts, coming from NFS and all. I was always high in points than my opponents. My car was much more advanced. I did so to win easily, of course.But the AI didn't care. My car: 210 Street level. Theirs: 150. AND YET I ATE THEIR DUST. Seriously, at level 20 you can have the best gear, the AI can be low, you will have to play multiple times a single god damn race because the AI just takes off, and you start with no Nitro and they do.Plus, the traffic AI seems to be out for you, always stopping for the enemy AI, but never for you.There is this one Offroad race that I had to play 7 times, because the Mini copper had infinite Nitro and just blasted away. Had to hit him into a tree to win. #Tactics. And that shouldn't happen. The game can be so frustrating, it's annoying. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it really gets on your nerve.Oh, you need to hunt down a car? Here, let me change lanes from the left to the right without indicators, so I drive right into you. Aw, that car is almost down with 20sec to go? Let me give it infinite nitro so you won't be able to catch up.Yes, the ""ram this vehicle to kill it"" missions are unfair as ♥♥♥♥, because they are always faster than you A lot. I had to learn their route to get them. #TacticsNr.2But despite all of that, I worked through it and I have to say: This game is good.Not the ""YOU GOTTA GET THEM ALL""-kinda good, but it's good. You can play it.Getting the entire game, plus Season Pass + ALL DLC' for 30€ was a really good deal. But I wouldn't pay more for this game.Ending:This is a good racing game with specialized cars and certain terrainracing for everyone. It's simple to mod and easy to get parts. The graphics are alright, but at least it works smooth on medium PC's. MultiPlayer is great, but no worries, Singleplayer is a lot of fun, too. For a -once-in-a-while-online-racing-game where you don't have to put a lot of time in, it is amazing.For a NFS-like racing game, it's not. If you see something challenging and realistic, not annoying, buy NFS 2016.If you just wanna drive around, offroad, drag, drifting, get this. The Crew.  8.7/10And watch out for that grey van. It's always standing around corners or on streets. It doesn't move. It will find you and kill you.			",92,13,0,11,16,0,3

												If you are looking for a solid multiplayer experience with your friends, do not buy this game. At the moment, the multiplayer aspect of the game barely works, and ironically, forming a crew with your friends is nigh on impossible. The singleplayer is solid enough, though gathering enough cash to buy new cars is a bit tedious. Edit: As of now, the multiplayer does seem functional enough for me to edit this review. While I cannot speak for the crew aspect (since none of my friends are interested in reinstalling the game so I can test it), PvP does seem to work fairly well for the moment. However, I was disappointed in the lack of variety in some PvP races; most notably in the Perf spec races. There is only one viable car to race with, the LaFerrari, forget trying to race with anything else because you will with most certainty lose.In the Street spec the Skyline is heavily favored, though it hardly matters what car you pick since most are fairly competitive. Sadly it is a spec that people rarely want to race with.As for Dirt spec races the Skyline is again favored by most players, though a skilled player should be able to stay with the pack in pretty much any car, granted it has all platinum parts installed.Raid is my favorite spec, but only because most cars in that class appear to be relatively balanced. What car you choose to race with appears to matter the least in this specific spec. As long as the car you choose has all platinum parts, you should be just fine with pretty much anything.And finally we come to the Circuit spec, and here the car does matter. From what I have seen you have three options in this spec. The Circuit Hotrod, the DLC Cadillac Escalade (I wish that was a joke) and finally the Alfa Romeo Competizione. The Hotrod is free, so that is what I recommend you get. When in a PvP lobby, expect to play a lot of Circuit and Perf spec races since these appear to be the most popular. And maybe once in a blue moon, you'll get to play a Street spec race.			",125,5,2,24,20,2,12

												Как всегда – будем честными. И скажу сразу… для меня «The Crew» один из наиболее спорных проектов UbiSoft. Я не помню, чтобы мне хотелось одновременно крыть игру всеми тяжкими, борясь с желанием из неё выйти и вернуть обратно деньги, потраченные на покупку, и одновременно хвалить игру, восхищаясь тем, чего в других играх ещё нет. Здесь на любой плюс гарантировано есть минус, если не три. Так что же заставляет меня рекомендовать эту игру? И кому её рекомендовать? Давайте разбираться. Во-первых, я рекомендую игру только таким же психам как я. То есть тем людям, которые готовы ехать вперёд. Долго и беспощадно. Не размениваясь на гонки, на лиги и дивизионы, на сотни безликих улучшений характерных для рогалика, но не для симулятора. Не застревая в дебрях худших интерфейсов игровой индустрии, но наслаждаясь спидометром, часами асфальта и порой удивительно красивыми видами. Не прося у игры быть игрой с большой буквой «И». Последнее умение большая редкость.Во-вторых. Я не рекомендую эту игру тем, кто ожидает от неё детализации GTAV, детализированных машин, корректного поведения их на дороге, хорошей физики, в том числе и физики разрушения последних упомянутых. В этой игре нереально многое. Гладкое полотно мира, где редко срабатывает подвеска, потому что колдобин, ухабов и других особенностей рельефа просто нет. Это мир призраков, где вы никогда не задавите перебегающее дорогу животное, потому что оно неосязаемо.  Это мир кирпичей, где вы никогда не разобьете машину, потому что это невозможно и где разбитая машина никогда не будет влиять на манеру езды. Это мир клонированных построек, где одну и туже закусочную вы увидите не один десяток раз. Это мир клонов, ибо машины трафика вокруг - копии друг друга. Они не имеют разных цветов, половых отличий и признаков. Это мир где ударившись о другую машину вы как ни в чём не бывало продолжаете ехать дальше. И это мир где будучи в одной сессии с другом вы можете его и не увидеть. Просто потому, что это игра про гонки с друзьями. Смекаете? Так какого же черта обзор «пальцем вверх деланный»?Эта история началась в Нью-Йорке, когда два раздолбая достигли 10 уровня. Это было уже после двух часов игры и продирания через дебри интерфейса, слёз и непонимания. На наших внутри игровых счетах образовалась круглая сумма в размере 100К. В отдельной спец-валюте. И вот здесь и началось что-то непонятное. Здесь игра вдруг стала другой. У дилеров оказались разные ассортименты. Я смог купить Dodge 1969 года, а он… и я тогда ещё не знал об этом (а ассортимент для каждого игрока в один момент времени - разный) Chevy Impala. Два масл-кара, которые встретившись вместе собрались пересечь Америку от восточного побережья до западного. Чтобы это случилось так, как случилось - мы послали к дьяволу игру отключив все возможные интерфейсы и клятвенно пообещали не открывать карту, руководствуясь лишь собственными географическими познаниями. Четыре часа мы не могли достичь желанной точки. Останавливаясь в отелях и заправляясь на бензоколонках (понарошку конечно). Приключение заняло три дня и две ночи по местному времени. Мы выехали из Нью-Йорка и описав петлю попали в него же. Проскочив Сент-Луис чуть не задели Канзас и «рухнули» в Большой Каньон. Его я вспоминаю с ужасом. Ещё ни в одной игре, кроме я не ехал столь долго. Он действительно велик. Не заезжая в Лас-Вегас (а зря!) мы забурились в Скалистые Горы и они полностью сломали нам ощущение ориентации в пространстве. Дорожный серпантин, определенно, меняет восприятие реальности. В совокупности с ночью это помогло нам проскочить Лос-Анджелес и потом полчаса гнать рядом со стеной… и, слава богу, что мозг таки сработал (что характерно не мой) и мы наконец осознали, что это великая мексиканская стена. Порой картинка была уныла, но чаще она подкидывала весьма красивые пейзажи, поражая размером. Его хотелось бы заполнить многим. Необходимостью заправляться есть и выполнять курьерские миссии, разумеется выходить из машины и бить живых мертвецов по башке разными подручными средствами. Спасать прекрасных дам и пить за здоровье спасенных за игрой в покер или кости, прожигая кровно заработанные в клубах сигаретного дыма и запахе старого дерева. Всё это было бы очень здорово… и очень хочется... но не в нашей жизни ребят. Вероятно детки наши такое увидят. Чтобы и размер был ого-го, и качество сервиса. Будь это GTAV, да с таким, мать его, причиндалом... но нет. Увы. Проработать ""по рокстаровски"" мир такого масштаба на данный момент невозможно. Если ничего из перечисленного нет, то почему рекомендация к покупке?Аркадная игра от подарила нам удивительный рпг опыт. Такой мне не давала ещё ни одна игра на этой планете. И должен сказать вам – иногда размер имеет значение. Вряд ли подобное повторится. Но я благодарен уже за то, что это было. И я очень люблю игры, которые позволяют мне там играть так как я хочу. По-своему. Я с трудом могу рекомендовать эту игру нормальными игрокам, но психам… ребятки – добро пожаловать. Всем остальным – в сад. Не потому что тут царство эстетов. Нет. Игра действительно спорная. И я никому её не хочу рекомендовать. Просто делюсь впечатлениями. И рассказываю, как всё происходило. Выбор всегда за вами за вами. Но… если вдруг сделаете это, не приходите и не кройте меня на чём свет стоит. Вас за выхлопную никто не тянул.P.S.Карта которая покажет наш путь куда лучше чем слова.

												I was surprised at some of the car choices they had available, and then some of the cars they left out, but overall, this is truely a petrol head's MMO. I suspect they will be releasing DLC for more cars, considering they left out anything from Hennesy, Ferrari, Maserati, Bugatti and some legendary classics such as the Lambo Contach and Diablo.The late and great Mr. Shelby is represented well as his last creation is probably one of the meanest cars available for it's specialization.There's is a little something for every type of racer, Rally(Dirt), Street, Circuit(Traditional Races), Baja(Raid), then your borderline street legals (Perf). And all customizable according to the cars specs.Cars range from the 67 Mustangs, 69 Camaros and 70's Chargers to your top end cars like Pagani, Lamborghini, Luxury Sports such as the Mercedes SLS AMGs and BMW M series even the Bentley S along with a little everything in between.The driving simulation leaves a little to be desired, but with so much to do in the game you will barely notice it.The Downfall to this game... Ford Explorers. They are everywhere and ready to screw you over on the turns that matter, the skills that you need gold or plat completion on for that car part you need, or in general they're just brake checking you while you're going 300 miles in your Dodge Viper SRT 10 fit for circuit racing and when you adjust to avoid, they'll be sure to change lanes into oncomming traffic so you rear end them. Also, the game unnaturally pulls you from your direction of travel at times and you need to compensate for that, which can mean over compensation and ruining your run. Public enemy #1 is still those damn Explorers.Overall 9/10			",107,9,0,11,16,2,23

												Medicore racing game filled with low poly traffic, lame-♥♥♥ races, untextured roads, and horrible AI.Needless to say, this would be impressive if it had come out in 2005. It manages to take the multiplayer concepts of Burnout Paradise and remove all the fun.Don't even get me started on the ""police chases"", what you think would be the best part of the game is actually the worst. If you think that you'll have a fun time driving up and down the US with your buddies while the cops are after you, go play an NFS title. All police chases in this game end the same way, the cops pull out infront of you, insta-stop and insta-bust you. Rinse and repeat.Awful excuse of a racing game, simply horrible. I'm sure there are better tagents and rants out there and I'm only touching on a few minor things that really ruined the game for me.The ""beta"" was also a great way to generate hype while the devs did nothing. Highlighted by their lack of fixing the roads and other odd glitches. (Flying off the map, cops teleporting around, traffic not navigating correctly, etc)Beta

												My experience so far is that while still a fun game it seems that everything done with the cars is done wrong. When I played the beta I just kept telling myself ""it's just a beta."" Boy was I wrong. Let tell you of my frustrations as well as what needs to be updated. -The car selection seems like someone obsessed with American muscle as well as DuPont catalogs. I don't want to street race in Ferrari and koinsegg (spelling). While I understand a few of these cars in the game it seems stupid for half the roster of a street racing game to be these kinds of cars. And there are 2-3 versions of old and new muscle. We have about 3-4 actual tuners to play with. Who made this car selection?-Pre-order bonus. Well I pre ordered the game for the Mini Cooper personally. Because I own one in real life. Was horrified to see that the pre order cars can only be used in street spec. Making them utterly useless. -The specs oh oh the specs. Advertised your game to be able to switch out specs on our cars on the fly for different race types. Reality sets in when you realize only a handful of starter cars can do every spec as well as only 1 truck having dirt spec. I'll say that last part again, only ONE truck in the game has dirt spec. Even the Hummer doesn't have a dirt spec. Once again WHAT WERE YOU THINKING. Is this a bug?!!!!! -Customization. If you thought the crew was gonna have the best customization since need for speed underground, then you better go back to your ps2. Customization is nonexistant. Besides a decent variety of paint and rims that's about it. Roughly 4 bumpers which are really just variations of the first 2, no trim paint options, no sticker color options, no painting of rims, no underglow, no ride height, no anything really. Watching your car be pulled apart while you customize it is merely a visual to make you think you have options. When in reality it needs some major work. Once again I will say this isn't a terrible game as the map was done really well and the game play is fun. But this is a story line based on street racing games and there isn't much street racing in the vehicles. Failed to capture that culture making it sub par in the end. So many details missed and little to no focus on the cars. Already the season pass promising more half million dollar cars instead of cars we asked for that are commonly found in street racing. I would rather see generic copy cats like the rx7, honda civic, Subaru sti and so on then have named car brands of crap nobody wants to use. You only need 1 mustang in a game not 15 versions of it.

												I'm 50/50 on this game. Its not bad, but its not great. The story is boring, the characters have no development and once you're done with the story you're just in freemode with not a whole lot to do. With this calling all units dlc, it gets really annoying to play. You have zoe every three minutes or so say 'Dont forget to check out the shop, you have a FREE car waiting.' The thing with the free car is in order to get it you have to buy the dlc. So if you dont have the dlc then you're stuck with zoe saying the same thing over and over again. Almost forgot to mention that when I opened up the game, it said something like 'Congrats you have unlocked the Nissan GTR, in order to drive it you have to buy the dlc' Yeah well ♥♥♥♥ you people.

												So, The Crew:Basically they took the idea of NFS Rivals and improved it, added a storyline, and optimized it better. The idea is that the game is always online. Any time you play it you will be able to see other people and even CO-OP with them. So is it better than NFS Rivals? Two words: Hell yes! It is better optimized for the PC, more customzation, and it has an actual story line. Some people are complaining that the map is not big enough. Well think about it - Fitting thousnds of miles/kilometers of roads and hundreds of cities into a game is pretty damn hard. Not to mention that if they did so, you'll probably get a game that will weigh over 100 GB's, and probably won't run on most PC's. So they took the best of what there is, and put it in the game. My only complain is that the game lacks some cars, for exmaple: Subaru Impreza WRX STI, or Toyota Supra. I expected to have those cars in a street racing game. I truely hope they add these cars sometime.And another thing, and this is aimed towards people, not the game itself: You complain about unrealistic physics in an ARCADE RACING game?! Are you serious?! An Arcade Racing game is supposed to have unrealstic physics. If you're looking for sims: Go for something like Assetto Corsa. Because this is not a Sim. This is an ARCADE RACING game.			",26,0,7,0,5,1,0

												Positives and negatives listed below for your convinence.   The crew is a racing game that is fun to play with or against random players or friends of up to 8 players. The game offers the map of the united states in a miniscale version with open world driving of races from street cars, performance, circuits, or dirt. This isn't Test drive unlimited 3 so I will not compare it to 2 and there are certain strengths this game has and certain things it needs to work on so don't pass up on it since it is fun to play. (working on review video) and the list is a work in progress as I play the game since I am not done with this list. By the way if you're one of the ♥♥♥ that is messaging your friend to downvote the review for your own obnoxious trolling and agenda, I will let you know now that since this is a work in progress you're wasting your time with the thumbs down and I know who you are  since you've made it blatantly obvious and  I delete and reput up every update I make as I play the game and I am sick of steam not taking action against thisAlso my reviews are final form done in video format from now on, thanks. My reviews are done about the game, not to tell you to buy it, or even that its the best game in the world nor am I payed to do this or to forcing you to buy it. I gave it a thumbs up because I had fun playing it for over 50 hours with friends and players online alike. Its to give you an insight to see if you want to buy it and play it or not.This review system needs a better moderation seriously. Pros+ Better off racing with a pad or a wheel(needs adjustment)and not keyboard, it is possible but best on either these 2 though the wheel will require a bit of adjusting in the options.+ This game is far more optimized than Assassin's creed unity and Farcry 4 + Decently good  graphics with Msaa settings cranked up if you can handle it, not the best but good.+ The story was decent, about 10+ hours, Revenge story what else can they do.+ 60 FPS gameplay is fast and furious+ Certain cars can be customized with kits. Street, Dirt, Performance, raid, and circuit spec for racing which is the type of spec you race at for specific regions of the united states, they seperated it into 5 different sections.+ The world map environment is  detailed there is so many things happening if you park your car and look around, Animals running by, Airplanes soaring past, and people walking along the streets. The immersive environment is fantastic.+ The skybox looks great as night and day cycle and depending on where you are located you'll see stars, the moon etc that looks aesthetically pleasing.+ Every car has its own interior and looks very nice and authentic though some parts aren't too great such as the dash widgets itself.+ Miniscale version of the u.s to drive and explore Many landmarks, events trials throughout the united states to compete in and rank the leaderboards and statistics.+ Handling choices such as sport, all assist, and hardcore, choose your own handling style and level.+ Cars upgrades as you do the trials and story mode to get the parts.+ You can buy the cars with CC if you don't feel like earning game cash to unlock it or you can earn game cash to unlock it,  You still have to earn the parts for the car via skills Trials etc. So your car is worthless without these trials done to earn the gear for it for it to drive faster and handle better etc.+ Drive all over the place using fast travel or just drive for your own entertainment, Day and night cycle occurs.+ Most importantly, with friends or even a crew of people to race around with this game is FUN+ MASSIVE CROSS COUNTRY RACE,JUST RACED FOR 2 hours in ONE race WOW!+ PVP and Coop Mode.+ Very competitive leaderboard system and trials. cons- The racing rules in this game is basically, if you lead first for a few hundred yds and do really well, noone can really beat you. The only way to win is to make a mistake at traffic or a collision turn, No matter how clean and how well you drive you'll just get outranked. There should be a system in place for those that drive clean instead of being the overpowered cars.- Not really a social mmo- Factions war online is pointless noone plays it- Car balance needs work- Online only game, Meaning your saves are online and everything else, when servers are down so is your game which sucks no offline mode at ALL!- The coop is lonely and not everyone accepts to help out the storyline, you can only invite friends but when it comes to randoms invite noone wants to really accept it and the chatbox feels lonely. Restricted to 8 players.- Engines in this game sounds bad.- Its a miniscale u.s many towns and city missing still as they add in more, so can be inaccurate and some people might not see things they want.- Limited Cars- No rear view mirror and side mirrors working. They really need to implement this- Need a better system in knowing who is racing in certain pvp lobbies across the u.s cities since its pretty massive and queing is all over the place, also finding the right quest for the pieces you need could be quite a mess- Lack of dynamic weather effects, Only snow in mountain.- Nice damage on car physics but it heals itself up like magic, ruins immersion- Hitting animals or people and they'll instantly dodge you like magic, some people may see this as very immersion breaking.- The game is about cars + parts, the better the car + parts the better you are at pvping other people basically racing against them. If you don't have a top gear car in races with level, then you will most likely get beaten. Topping out car specs and level is important to winning this makes the balance in pvp a bit unfair especially when a 500 level car will vs a 1200 rank car etc.- The radio music is very limited and just isn't great, I shut off the radio and play my own track the s, The soundtrack for the story though is great- Microtransactions to unlock cars defeats the purpose of challenge.- Cross country Ai are horrible. Others and or changes via patch+-- Constantly repeating the same trial just to get the best + parts can get really daunting. The good news is you can BUY THEM once you unlock them at the garage+- Server situations is more stable now+- If you are impatient you can pay for in game cars and aesthetics but rest assured, THIS IS NOT A PAY TO WIN GAME AND EVERYTHING CAN BE EARNED EASILY just pvping and doing trials etc for cash.+- Once again this game is created by IVORY TOWER and PUBLISHED by UBISOFT. Get the facts straight please and stop hating.+- Your money your cash, buy the game now or wait for price drop.			",810,183,33,104,81,7,110

												First thing I have to say before I write this review is : NO, it's not that annoying as everybody says about DLC's. It's not true, it never bothered me while playing the game. This game, is one of the best racing experiencies I've ever had. It's very, but very realistic when talking about driving behaviour, drifting, skidding on snow, driving on dirt and so on. I have to say, crashing into something isn't that realistic, but still gives you a pretty nice looking damage to car (but won't influence the behaviour of a car).Pros: This is the biggest open map game I have ever played. I mean, I spent around 17 hours driving and racing, and yet, not even 40% of map is discovered. Driving is just a pleasure, it's a lovely thing to do. What I enjoyed the most was driving on snow with a performance car. I mean, seriously, there isn't a better thing to do. This game gives you driving experience on dirt, snow, roads, off-roads, mountains and I mean everywhere where you possibly can be driving. Cons: Like I said, it doesn't really support any crash-hitboxes or anything like that. It's not a race simulator like Asetto Corsa or Project Cars. I don't put here as a con thing about DLC's, it's not that annoying at all, didn't bother me for a second.To sum it up:If you're looking for a car game with huge open-world map, possibility to tune and customize your cars and having fun just by driving from point A to point B, get this game! You won't regret a single dollar you spent on this game. 9,5/10			",299,73,9,20,24,6,28

												Keep in mind: I rarely, very rarely, ever dislike a game. I don't even think bad rats is that bad, even with all of it's weird 2d-but-with-z-axis-inconsistent-physics. All I wanted was an open world racing game, much like Burnout Paradise. I can't even fathom why they published this. • The ground is made of ice• The cars are made of styrofoam• Every little bit of audio is muffled• Hitting anything or even trying to turn the car slightly turns you into a ♥♥♥♥ing tornado• Cars going in a straight line is physically impossible• You'll spend half of your play time fiddling with the handling options• Cars act as though they just have one, gyroscopical wheel in the center, instead of one regular wheel on all four corners• The pedestrians, which serve no purpose to begin with, are made out of wax, and teleport out of the way• Instead of crashes tearing your car apart, particles that could make up an entire other car are emited out of thin air• The people online are either five-year-old-glue-sniffers, or they see no reason to play this game other than to ram into the front of my car while I'm in the options menu. If it's the latter, I don't blame themIt's like this is a college student's game design thesis made in unity. I paid $50 for this ON SALE from giftcards, selling trading cards, and going through the headache that is Paypal to Steam. I could have spent that money on getting 10 really good games that I would have never played. Most of Ubisoft's games get flack for being unoptimised, yet I still enjoy it. This is the complete opposite: It's fairly optimised, but my god do I cringe when trying to even remotely enjoy it.I'll probably still play through this just because of how much I spent on it.

												In General The Crew is a baby of Test Drive and Driver : San Francisco with a little touch of NFS seriesThe game have all the Digital Petrol Head wants fast cars stunning views and twisty mountain roads and ofc. Bonneville flats, the game world feels crowded and alive from bison packs running across the roads wolfs and bears lurking in the woods. One of the strong points of the game is the freedom and open world saw something interesting at the horizon you actually can go there. you can drive there on the road in you Street spec car or switch to something off rowdy and go in straight line trough woods and over the mountains. Every car got its own feel to it they all handle differently, from straight line muscles to agile japan tuner cars, and the crew brigs it back you love a car A here take it drive it, your car A is short on power and cant outrun a faster cars here put some power in it, oh you don't like the stock looks no problem in that compartment either.Not like allot of other driving series oh you Hate car X! Here drive it!!!! , Oh you love your car A sure drive it but only until you progress and then you will have to drive car X!game puts decision back in gamer hands i love car A i drive it, not like the other games you have to drive cars XYZthe Handling model cant say is brilliant but its fun, its somewhere in between arcade and simulator.From me Game gets solid 8,4/10 but its score for the beta. But definitely see you on the road.			",125,11,5,12,6,0,5

												I bought this game on release (no pre-order) and played it for a week and had to stop because my laptop couldn't handle the detail in the game. It let me play it but fps would drop frequently. Fast foward to 2016 and a used gaming pc running GTX 550I and i got NO ISSUES with the game.Ever since I began playing it on a desktop computer with a real graphics card i haven't had time to play anything else let alone watch some anime. Ended up completing the campeign within 2 weeks durring my free time and i must say i love it! I even bought a xbox one controller with usb cord to play the game--and it plays superb with the controller. The wheel has mixed reviews but its not for everyone, i know that sometime this year i will for sure buy a wheel/peddle combo for this game.The custimization of the cars is handled well withe the fact that when you make it to level 50, you gain the opportunity to earn more custimzation such as more front bumpers or more rims.PVP is fun as well however if one player has bad internet connection it will interupt the game for a few seconds only as the match reconnects everyone.I do not ( i have googlefiber) so I always hope that whenever i enter pvp lobby that everyone has decent internet.Now that my storyline is done i had a day where i wasn't sure what to do but then i remembered the wild run expansion and the endless possiblities (until this time i had focused on campeign) and now im pumped again!The updated graphics were a must for the game and now that they have done that  i do say all the landscape looks amazing! I'm getting the Wild run expansion and i can't wait to drive a monster trick up the side of a mountain or thru las vegas :PEver since i finished the campeign i have been planning on what story to write as i continue to play 'The Crew'. Whatever story i choose to write and drive thru i will sure as hell have hours upon hours of fun!Who knows maybe if i end up driving and writing the story i might publish it as a fanfic :P but thats months away i bet!Conclusion:The crew was good at release but since the Wild Run Expansion and upgradted graphics mainly, it has gotten far better than I could have imagined. Granted there are still some hiccups such as the pvp lobby intrupting gameplay (pausing it for 5 seconds) if a player has pretty bad internet connection. Otherwise they have worked hard on improving the game since release. An Xbox One Controller works great with the game and i can't imagine myself playing it on a keybored ever again! (unless i didn't have access to a controller!)Even though on steam this game has alot of mixed reviews i hope we as a gaming community can give this game the support it could use to really inspire the developers to greater hights with this game. The potential of it is without limits. Let's hope they never stop adding to this wonderful game.oh yeah, and its fun! ",41,6,0,12,9,0,11

												The game really isnt worth buying. At first the game was really fun and seem to have a lot of potential. once you hit the max level you can  pvp, do 1hour+ long faction missions and free roam. The faction missions aren't that fun to do and are basicly made pointless when you can easily send friends out to (not actual friends they send and ai) to do the faction mission for you. Pvp is ok but needs to have a lot more game modes. The free roam is fun but I end up driving in the same areas seeing as how most of the map is either highways or ai filled citys. The offroading is a lot more fun than the on road seeing as how you can either go onto the dirt roads or make your own ""roads"" with the raids spec. One issue with the game is that getting any car in the game is as easy as just farming a few pvp missions or sending friends on faction missions, even getting the hidden cars isn't satisfying at all.  Another issue is that the so called fixes they have implemented into the game dont seem to fix much, a lot of the performance improvements to some of the rear wheel drive cars dont actually improve anything. Car customization is great and all but what I would rather have is a system more like forza horizon 2 where I can swap engines, buy diffrent parts for the car, body parts that actually affect the performance instead of just looking cool. The games car progression system compared to horizons is very dull, all you do is find a few jump challenges that are easy to do with the car you are using and just sit there farming for a few hours till you have a max level car. I am going to end here, there is a lot more I could talk about but this review is already long.tl;dr: The game is fun but lacks in certain game mechanics. Its also very boring once you realise how easy it is to get the most expensive car. patchs dont fix much.If you want something better save your money and buy something more along the lines of project cars or if you own an xbox buy horizon 2 there is a larger car selection and you can properly tune cars. Although I did have fun with the game I would much rather have horizon 2 where I can basicly tune the tyres, gearing, springs, damping and all that good stuff. Again there are more things I could talk about but I dont want to make this any longer than it is.Edit: Another issue that I really wanted to mention is the car variety is very little and the dlcs only add 3 cars each.

												Can not recommend this game to any new players at all. There are so many issues, bugs and crash problems with this game that Ubisoft has acknowledged and refuses to fix. For more than a year these issues have persisted, you can even youtube these problems with keywords as "" The Crew terrain bug "".Ubisoft has not shown any support in fixing these problems for the duration of the year despite the community having upwards of 40+ pages on both the Steam forum and the Ubisoft The Crew forum. There support consists of "" Please give us more information about the crash so we can help fix it "" while doing nothing.The Crew has some of the worst finicky hardware related issues I have seen in a game in my time, you can deck yourself out with the greatest hardware and still have problems, or you can have average to low and have little problems and then vice versa again.The Crew is a beautiful looking game for it's release date, platforms and multiplayer capacity, I have enjoyed many hours driving around the "" virtual usa "" map which is not 100% accurate, probably not even 60%, but it has it's moments driving passed landmarks, or through new york city for example. On ultra settings the game will definitely impress for visuals and excitement. Plently of entertainment driving around completing missions or cruising with friends, performing co-op missions, on that note though, you must be aware that anyone in the world can and will affect your gameplay experience. You are not really 'locked' behind a security blanket in The Crew, your missions can be interupted by other players which will effect your personal experience, due to a lack of any form of moderation or adminship in the game, trolling others is not at all against the rules. Blocking entrances, ends of races, race markers, anything goes.The Crew's over all performance for game play is a fun and enjoyable experience, if you can enjoy it that is. With constant crashes and terrain issues, or game freezes it becomes a frustrating mess at times. If you're willing to give the game patience and grit your teeth through all it's cancer, you might be able to sit down and have a pretty good time, and godspeed to you.However, I must conclude with, the price of the game vs it's overall problems, is not worth the buy. Ubisoft shows no support or help / compensation for players so the price will never cover the frustration of it's downfalls. With a 2nd expansion in the works and issues still unresolved and full pricing for the expansion with no compensation for the previous owners who are not able to even load the game due to "" The Crew has stopped responding "" at startup, I can not give this game a passing score. It is a flop, a fail, a miserable purchase and a game that gets shelfed quickly soon after your bad experiences become more infuriating then attempting to load the game time and time again.TLDR:  Ubisoft doesn't support it, it's priced heavily for a broken game.2/10, do not recommend. Find another game.			",39,0,0,0,0,0,7

												If you enjoy racing games and not just racing Sims and you ever played MCO from EA and have always been looking for a replacement this is as close as there has been.The driving still needs some work cars float too much but overall the game will be a nice change from every other online game currently available.1/1/15 UpdateAfter spending quite a few hours learning and fine tuning a number of cars I've dicovered that the handling isn't as bad as I had previously assumed. Before I hadn't done much adjusting of the settings but now that I have I can deifnitely confirm the handling is fine just the defaut handling gets you off to a bad start.I now have a 1299 car of all but Raid spec which is much harder to grind the parts on. There are certian cars for certain races. Races in the Mountain range on snowy roads are better in a Ford Focus than a Ford Mustang.The game has alot going for it but they really need to work on expanding the Map maybe DLC's that add more cities into the map would be a quality start. They really need to work hard on more cars ASAP there are tons of cars that could be added to this game that would really give it a lot more life. Not everyone wants a Ferrari or Lamborghini and while the Koenigsegg Agera R is an awesome car it's just not realistic to use on a US map.Car models I'd love to see added to the game would be more upper class but not super cars. Lexus, Audi, Cadillac and Acura. There are just a lot of cars left out that the game really needs.I really enjoy the game and there is nothing that would make me quit playing it. Weekly missions in game need to happen more often and there should be some type of end game which right now the only end game is racing other players.			",38,0,7,5,16,0,1

												Hmm, The Crew.This game received a lot of criticism at launch, and its not like it didn't deserve it; the game was lacking in a lot of aspects and had so much potential to be more than what it was.Fast forward to now when the Wild Run expansion has released and brought a slew of changes to the game visually and gameplay wise. I would actually recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the Test Drive Unlimited series which were also made by some of the developers of this game! If a huge map, exotic vehicles + customisation, and the freedom to drive around is what you want then this game has it all and plenty.I mostly played The Crew prior to the Wild Run update. It was actually a lot of fun going through the to be honest meh storyline, but that isn't what anyone bought this game for. The selling point was obviously the fact that the map is a scaled version of the United States, and good grief is it amazing.For what it is, it has plenty of detail (and now looks stunning as well thanks to the update) and nothing will beat the road trips you take solo or with friends, perhaps strangers on the road also playing their own game (so to speak because its a quick drop in/out lobby system for lack of a better phrase) between the various states. Putting my phone on a speaker dock next to me, setting up my Logitech DFGT, turning off the HUD, going to cockpit view and cruising along the freeways at night is just so wonderful I can't even describe it. And it's not short road trips either, getting across the states will take an actual hour or 2, maybe more, depending on the route. Super easy to lose time in this game like that.Speaking of, car physics. It's pretty arcadey, but everyone expected that (right?). They've definitely improved it since launch and its fine to play now for the most part IMHO.Customization is handled pretty well. The UI could with quality-of-life tweaks but the modding of each vehicle it self is pretty well fleshed out (looking at you, NFS 2015). Should be noted, that all the vehicles do not have all the specs available to them. You can imagine my disappointment to the lack of a raid Murcielago :( still, Fiat 500 Monster Truck.Music selection in this game is nice, didn't agree with a few songs but hey, I just play my own while playing now so. Car selection is also pretty good.I cannot speak much for the events and the Wild Run exclusive ""Summit"", but I hear good things. PVP races are prone to being glitchy occasionally (maybe they fixed this now, can't tell for sure) but they have definitely balanced the vehicles you can use for the races now as compared to pre-Wild Run (the LaFerrari was the go to car if you wanted any chance at winning for example in the Perf-spec), so thank you devs!So there you go, my thoughts on The Crew. Would 100% recommend if you love cruising around the USA.			",138,6,16,10,7,1,2

												Welp here is my kinda quick who gives a damn about spelling review on the crew, Even though everyone gave this game ♥♥♥♥ before it had even come out due to ubisoft and how they are but This is coming from someone who is max level and finished the story,Pros- The game looks really nice,cars are very nice to look at and sound very nice, the map feels very large and has lots of different terrain and weather which does effect the handling which is good. The story is rather enjoyable for a racing game and it is an adult level story not some dumbed down kids friendly story that makes me want to cry (Test Drive 2 im looking at you), The cars handle well for what they are and upgrading does actually make the cars feel better to drive.Cons- (ohboiherewego.jpg) Welp this game does have its fair share of cons so far. The whole name of the game is the crew, which is funny conisdering me and my friends cant join each others crews, and the fact most of the time you are playing you never see anyone else driving around, and teleporting to friends to see them doesnt help because they never show up on your screen. Another con would be the huge lack of support with these problems and how none of the devs seems to care about the connections problems (Which isnt good considering this game is apparently an mmo, and an mmo with connection issues isnt a good thing). The last few cons would be gameplay based, the other ai racers in this game are either so stupid they drive into rivers or they are so rediculously op that they cant be caught even by the best of drivers in the best of cars, and the last con would be im having a problem where the game seems to take control of the car and ♥♥♥♥ you up at the worst of times.Final thought: Even with this extensive amount of cons i would still reccommend this game as the majority of these cons will be fixed within the next few days (hopefully) and the game is rather enjoyable otherwise.

												The Crew is an okay game, it offers such a wide variety of feats. Skill challenges, Races in PvE and PvP and now including The Summit with stunts and freedrive challenges in it's latest expansion. In return however, the game has so many pet peeves that can bother a player to stop playing forever. Like a finish line delay that could lose you some seconds while playing with people outside your region, the ability to exploit some obstacles to gain seconds and a slightly messed up balance between vehicles. People hope for the best experience in every little aspect of the game, but The Crew is so massive that it can not offer this. As a result, The Crew does just about average in everything. You're not supposed to like The Crew because of sounds, amount of cars, customization, graphics or handling specifically. It expects you to like the wide selection of literally everything it has. Would it do better for players liking specific feats if the game chooses to minimize it's offers? Yes. You'll leave other people disappointed however. It's up to the developers to offer the best experience out of everything it has. You can see they 'slowly' improve on some stuff, but with each pro comes it's cons.I like The Crew because of it's variety and I try to look through the well-known pet peeves to enjoy an actual fun game. So far I think I'm doing a good job at it. I'm coming back to the game from time to time to see if anything new happened.Should you buy The Crew, the Season Pass, the Wild Run expansion or anything named together for the full price? No. Wait for a 50% discount. This will cause you less annoyance, but still have a jolly good time in a fun open-world racing game.			",161,17,17,14,13,2,29

												The Crew features an open and persistent world for racing and free-roaming across a scaled-down recreation of the contiguous United States. The map is split into five regions: The Midwest, East Coast, Mountain States, West Coast, and The South. Each region has its own unique geographical features. Six main cities (one in each region, two in The Midwest) are featured in the game: Detroit and Chicago in the Midwest, New York City on the East Coast, Miami in The South, Las Vegas in the Mountain States, and Los Angeles on the West Coast. Various other cities, such as San Francisco, Seattle, Salt Lake City, Dallas, New Orleans, Washington D.C., and St. Louis, are also featured in the game. Over thirty smaller cities and towns line the countryside like Nashville, Norfolk and others. It takes approximately 45 minutes in real time to drive from coast to coast in-game. The single-player campaign is 20 hours long, and entails infiltrating criminal groups with protagonist Alex Taylor (Troy Baker). Players can also participate in mini-games called skills challenges that are peppered across the world. They are triggered when a player drives through them and it involves completing challenges such as weaving through gates and staying as close to a racing line as possible for a period of time. Players' scores are automatically saved so friends can try and beat their scores, in similar fashion to how Autolog works in games of the Need for Speed franchise. Missions can be played alone, with friends, or with online co-op matchmaking. The multiplayer mode lets a maximum of eight players to compete in races and other gametypes. There are no in-game loading screens or pauses.			",858,237,52,93,92,13,121

												One of very few games I've returned/had $ refunded for.  Graphics are pretty good (8/10), from the single player storyline/plot/character interaction I experienced, I enjoyed it (not going to give a numeral rating as I experienced very little of this due to quickly refunding the game).  Unfortunately, the driving physics and controller (wheel) support is garbage.  I have a G27, I'm quite familiar with *it's* issues (such as the ~18-20% hardware deadzone on the wheel), but I've managed to get it working properly in all driving games I've played that can natively support the wheel.  Having said that, I spent ~2 hours tweaking the controls in this game, as well as pouring over forums about the 'best' setups for the G27 in the game, and I could never get these two aspects of the wheel behavior correct; steering 'weight' (any amount of weight on the wheel, just from your hands, is enough to move it around without turning up the force feedback, which then *kind* of gives it a proper feel.  its not just a 'centering' issue, i couldn't find a way to sustain 'weight' to the wheel, i'd constantly and seemingly randomly go 'slack' and not when the front wheels were off the ground or anything like that).  the other aspect is the 'arcadey' feel many other reviews here and posts online have detailed; it is just very hard to 'organically' control cars in this game with a wheel, its more of a 'black or white' 'left or right' 'straight or smashing into a wall' control.On top of the control issues, which definitely ruin what could be a phenomenal game, to me; there is the issue of the amazingly overaggressive and cheating AI - going ~180 in a 'street' upgraded mustang and the *normal* cop cars aren't having trouble catching up at all, in fact, they're so fast they'll actually surround you and start body slamming your vehicle.I should probably just stop buying any ubisoft games, they seem to all have a common theme; pretty good gfx + decent concept + horrifically ruined by not polishing the gameplay properly. = ubisoft games.If they ever fix the controls in the game, I'd *definitely* buy it; however, I doubt this will ever happen, I bought this in 2017, and these same exact complaints have existed in the community since its release at the end of 2014.

												First of all I would like to start off by saying that I have played approximately 20 hours of the game.  This has basically put my most of the way through the campaign.  My background with the game started earlier this summer when I got invited into the closed beta.  (Played about 6-8 hours)  The very first problem with this game is that you can't just use steam, on top of steam you have to use UPlay(Only works about half the time and takes forever to get into the game)  The next problem is that once you get into the game (assuming you have an internet connection) it tends to be rather buggy.  There seems to be an issue with optimization because my computer is rather capable and more than meets the minimum and recommended specs.  As with most AAA titles lately if you have AMD hardware you definitely need to beware  (my laptop with Nvidia hardware runs the game much better)  The main problem seems to be around the cities(Lots of buildings and poor optimization).  All in all this fits together to be a rather poor title but the one thing that keeps nagging me is the physics of the game itself.  I could probably get past the online all the time (Wasn't explicitly stated that you have to be) or even the sometimes poor framerates.  But the poor and might I add inconsistent physics and handling between cars is terrible.  Now I can personally say that I have never driven most of the vehicles in-game, but last time I checked a 600-900 horse Ferrari should be able to drift much better than an off-road Chevy Silverado(Actually have driven this).  However this is not the case all the muscle cars that people have been sliding around for years and years are impossible to drift.  The only game mode that seems remotely realistic is that of circuit racing.  I wasn't expecting this to be Forza Motorsport realistic but I at least expected it to feel something like Dirt 3 or Grid (Something sim-cadeish).  Finnally about the physics we are looking at the terrible bug where sometimes you will be cruising along and hit the same curb or patch of dirt you have hit 100 times with no consequence and now all of a sudden you are tossed into the air and are placed miles behind your competitor.  All in all I am extremely dissapointed with the crew as I have been waiting for a U.S. playground for cars for years.  Guess I am still waiting.			",52,2,7,4,12,1,5

												After clocking in 36.1 hrs in this game. i have come to the conclusion that this is the first and LAST time i EVER buy a game from Ubisoft. This was a huge let down in many aspects. While i try my best to focus on the good of the game ( will be stated lower down), from time to time i find my self regretting the fact that i went against my instincts to not buy the game ( reason being deep down i felt like this game would be a total let down after ACU: Assasin creed Unity reviews).Pros( may or may not state all)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+Huge map+driving never really feels repetitive unless doing specific races+open world+fun skill challenges, races, and faction races+being able to make crews between friends and or people you don't know ( Chance to make friends online).+Earning money is not a struggle therefore buying cars aren't a headache-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cons ( to many to list)-Crew are limited to only 4 people-very low car selection from since launch-Car modeling is sub par for a next gen game-Street cars and circuit cars have a fetish for driving offroad-when turning corners in any class of car, it feels like you're slamming the vehicle to the left/right-driving dirt cars feel like you're constantly drifiting on ice-not much to do with friends besides races, missions and more races just pvp this time-Story line is a little to predictable ( not a deal breaker)-driving against AI constantly feels like the game is trying to recreate a movie scene where the race ends in NECK&NECK-IF MY CAR HAS A RATING OF 900+ THERE IS NO REASON OR SENSE FOR AI CARS RATED AS 600 AND BELOW TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO KEEP UP WITH ME.-Cop chases feel like you're car weighs 5 lbs and the cop cars have the wieght of an Airbus A380 jumbo Jet. when they hit you, you're car gains the speed of a bullet and goeing into the direction you're hit too, how ever when you hit the cop car that looks like it can be taken down easily, u still gain the speed of a bullet and fly into the opposite direction you hit the car into.-Cop cars that aren't exotic or have have the potential to go past 200MPH should NOT be keeping up with my Lambo. thats is Blazing by on the highway @ 245MPH. I swear, this game makes police chases feel as if some of the cop vehicles have magnetic propulsion systmes in them.-Graphics needs to be boosted up ( a bit apauling for a next gen game)i also felt like more effort were placed into using shaders and other techniques to mask the bad graphics.-For a game that has such a huge scale map, the entire world feels empty to some extent; eg: the only place civilians are prevalant are in medium to large cities in states such as like NY, LA and Illanois. And despite their presence in these locations, their numbers are outstandingly low leaving a feeling of deserted city with just civilian vehicles going in and out of.-THE DRIVING PHYSICS, HANDLING & everything else involved with the movement of cars are ABSOLUTLY APPAULING. ( driving games like NFS underground feels alot more bearable than this in my honest opinion. countless times while driving circuit cars, i begin to get the feeling like im driving my car on ice when moving at high speeds (it feels like im moving a lamborghini at rocket speeds on ice while trying to stare).-Accident situations are just wacky. by that i mean if i get careless while racing and make a mistake, and go offcourse i just have to hold B on the controller and i will respawn OR sometimes when im 150 mph+ & i am about to hit a tree or a car i sometimes just slide to the side like nothing was there. If im not lucky that happnes then i must endure a mandetory cutscene of my crash that sometimes happens in the wierdest ways. (cutscene can be skipped once 1 or 2 seconds have passed its bearable).-The speed of the cars are just all over the place. exotic cars can have the tendancy to bearly feel different ater leveling them up to 1299 ( max level ) in their respective classes ie street, dirt, raid & Circuit. for example. i bought a lamborghini Mercealago after spending some time doing races, the car top speed in full stock was 219MPH , currently i have leveled the car up to 1230, the max speed i have reached with this car is 249 MPH with NOZ blowing out the exhaust pipes like the mouth of a dragon.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------There are much more CONS, however you the reader should get an idea by now. In conclusion i felt completly let down by this game. i haven't bought a racing game since the new NFS most wanted was released in 2012. I Thought Ubisoft was going to really dilever on this game but i was WAY out of the ball park with my expectations. I was fooled by the CG Trailors of the game they were releasing to hype this game up. To me there is limited fun to have in this game so therefore i will not recommend this game to anyone as of this moment unless this game undergoes heavy amounts of fixing.			",37,2,7,0,5,1,1

												honestly, I like UBI before, but haven't bought any games from UBI after I purchase this sh*t...this is the only one I've ever seen that the season pass only have the car pack in it, you have to pay if you want to play new DLCs...I bought the Ultimate Edition long time ago, when they release the Wild Run DLC, they ask me to buy it so I stop playing this until I saw there is a new update of it. the Wild Run is included in the season pass and free to play now, because there is another DLC called Calling All Units released, and they said I need to pay 40CDN to play that.Nah UBI. I'm going to play the Forza Horizon 3 now, it's much better than this			",86,2,11,0,9,0,2

												This is an amazing racing game. Huge open world, tons of races and hidden events to find, and an awesome customization system for your cars. The handling is a little weird and takes some time to get used to, but isn't bad at all. Imagine Burnout Paradise but with customization of cars. The map is so much fun to explore just beacause of the simple fact that you can just drive right off the road at any point and blaze your own path to the next goal/start point/car dealership/whatever you may be wanting to drive to. I feel this game will get a bad rap just because of the use of uPlay, but I will put up with uPlay anyday of the week to play this game, it's that good. I find myself forgetting what I am suppose to be driving to, and just driving around looking at the world change. It is also nice that it runs well (note that at this time I am writing this during the beta and the game is capped at 30fps. But no crashes or game breaking bugs). All in all, this game is really awesome. I have had a ton of fun in my first 10 hours and I can't wait to keep playing.			",158,11,13,4,5,1,9

												It's an alright game, but nothing that was promised to us. I had fun with it, but I tought this will be ""THE"" game that I will play countless hours. But the p2p connection and all the failed atempts at fixing the netcode went wrong.Sadly it will never redeem itself without totally remaking the p2p system, the pvp and such. But for the money's worth, you get many hours of fun until you're doing the challenges, skills, missions, faction missions, getting parts and such. So I recommend it, even tough it didn't come out as ""THE"" game, but still an okay game nonetheless.			",75,4,1,3,5,0,1

												Welp, since I have nothing to do today, might as well speak my mind on The Crew, which is something I have been intending to do for a while.This would also be my first serious and semi-long review, so enjoy.Ah, The Crew. I remember how hyped I was for it when I saw the first E3 announcement back in 2013. I thought ""Wow, this game looks perfect for me. Nice cars, huge map that is the entire U.S.A, seamless multiplayer, etc."" Long story short, by the time the game released in 2014, I had forgotten completely about it due to my addiction at the time called Team Fortress 2.Well, in early 2016, I bought The Crew, since I had nothing else to play and didn't want an Xbox One just to play Forza Horizon. I thought it could be a decent alternative, which, surprisingly, was a pretty okay alternative at the time. I actually had fun in The Crew, doing story missions and meeting new people to do them with was a nice experience. Building cars and leveling them up was also a much better experience than I thought it would be. Then why is it a bad game?The thing with The Crew is that it's not necessarily a bad game with a bad concept. Infact it had a TON of potential. A racing MMO is a cool concept, and The Crew was a good attempt at it (keyword: ""was""). I genuinely enjoyed playing through the story. But the thing is, once you beat it you realize there's nothing left, well, except for one thing. PvP. You try PvP races with your, uh... what's the performance measure called again? I don't know. Forgot. Let's just call it ""level"" for convenience's sake. You try PvP races with your level 900 Perf spec RUF, and realize that you are getting completely crushed by cars that are level 1299 (I think the new cap is 1399 though). You wonder what to do, and decide to look up some guides on the community hub. You find the car levelling guide, which tells you that you must farm late game skills (which are in the western side of the map) and eventually level your car to a competitive 1299 (or 1399). Once you get your car to the max level, you race, you win, and you repeat until you are swimming in cash. Once this happens, you suddenly realize that you are at the absolute end game, with literally nothing else to do, and you quit the game for good. But wait, what's this? An expansion pack? Maybe your journey actually isn't fi... HOLY ♥♥♥♥ HOW MUCH FOR THAT EXPANSION?The absolute main problem with the game is that it is a HUGE COCKTEASE if you do not buy DLC. The game pushes to buy DLC, namely the expansion pack. Back when I was actively playing this game, the Wild Run expansion was its own thing, which the game advertised me to get nonstop (which I didn't, thankfully). The game constantly teases you with trials with loan cars that you can't own without the proper expansion pack. You will be inclined to get it, but don't, really. This is a Ubisoft game, people. They WANT you to buy as much DLC as you can. The DLCs usually hold very nice content locked behind a paywall, a big paywall that is. A paywall that is never worth it, not even on sale. I mean really? 40 bucks? Really not worth it. Not to mention microtransaction currencies too.By the way Ubi REALLY ♥♥♥♥ed people with the new Calling All Units expansion, but you can read other reviews on why that is, as I do not own the DLC.And to add more salt to the wound, in addition to the horrid DLC pricing, the game is plagued with metric ♥♥♥♥tons of bugs and issues, it's actually insane. For example, The digital displays in cars' interiors don't work, only the gauges do. That might be a small detail, but when you realize even games that aren't racing games, like GTA, have working digital displays, it comes as a real disappointment, and shows how lazy the devs are. They did this on the new cars too. Neither the GT-R nor Huracan have proper working displays. And that's just a basic issue with the game. There are so many game breaking bugs that I can't even start to mention, or else this review would be longer than the entire code of The Crew. Like really, would it have taken that much time to make it so there are more than 10 people at a time in a huge open world and that they don't constantly disconnect and lose each other?And after all that, they still gouge you till your wallet is completely empty?So what are you saying, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ guy who cares too much about car displays?What I'm saying is, is that The Crew, neither the base game or DLC are worth it anymore, not even on sale price. You'll end up disappointed, trust me. And if you don't trust me, trust the 7600 other negative reviews about this abomination of a once decent game.Thanks for reading.			",32,5,7,1,5,0,0

												This game can be very fun, and it definitely has a lot of options, both for single/campaign mode, as well as online mode. I'm definitely not a big fan of online gaming, but I did give it a try on this game and I will admit that I did enjoy it. What PISSES me off about this game is the fact that for certain challenges (in story mode) they computer AI CHEATS LIKE A MOTHER F*@#ER and it drove my blood to boil a lot of times, to the point that I almost threw my controller at the computer monitor. I wish they would 1, allow for different difficulty modes, especially for those people that are more about story line than gameplay, and 2, that they would allow for the use of trainers/cheats for the campaign only part of the game. I thought the visuals were pretty stunning, particularly the settings. I really loved the whole continental US map which you can freely drive to your heart's content. I wish they would have an update that would allow for a road trip to Alaska, that would just be AWESOME! Anyway, I do recommmend the game, however be warned you will lose your cool at some point... If you're that type of gamer that hates it when the computer AI cheats both the physics, and the fact that the other drivers are always faster than you, despite having a higher levle car than the suggested level on screen.

It definate perks are its massive recignisable world and its ability to entertain without forcing races on people.

It is a stupid revenge story with terrible dialogue.Pvp is not even balanced. all car tiers are allowed. there is no way to race friends equally.Frustrating AI.Ridiculous physics.Online functions are shallow. It does not feel important at all. They are repeated over and over again.Cars do not feel that different.Pointless radio towers.Police are on all sorts of drugs and cant catch ♥♥♥♥.And mainly the game focuses more on stupid arcarde missions like collecting packages or smashing cars, which are repeated over and over again in the story mode.You spend more time doing stupid side missions that are repetitive.Instead of racing.THE GAME HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A CREW			",290,50,7,27,23,3,38

												Alright, with quite a bit of beta play and about 20 hours of release version play (despite steam's counter reading 14 at the time of writing), I think I'm able to give some preliminary opinions on this game. First off, this game is not perfect. There are little graphical and gameplay quirks that happen here or there, such as the cockpit view getting a little glitchy past 200mph, and annoying car resets after what should have been seamless, on the fly missions that place you exactly where you were, but stopped. Not to mention, the server system seems a little flaky.  One second, I am online with a dozen players, and after completing a mission, I am completely alone. However, this is a brand new release, and with Ubi marketing this as more of an MMO, I'm holding out hope that those things will be taken care of in the future.Those hangups aside, the game has proven to be quite enjoyable. Physics wise, on road car handling almost reminds me of the good old days of the 1st Need For Speed: Most Wanted. Perhaps, just a little grittier, but fun nonetheless. In my honest opinion, off the road is where this game really shines, though. For anyone who's played the game FUEL, off road vehicle handling should feel awfully familiar to you. I was excited to hear that a few devs from the FUEL team worked on this game, and you can certainly notice the influence they had.As far as gameplay? Missions aren't all that much to talk about, none are particularly outstanding, but they pace them well, and I've yet to get bored. Car customization was not nearly as in-depth as I had hoped, which is dissapointing. Certain cars can't even be modded in ways that would seem to make sense. For example, you cannot take a Ford Raptor truck, and convert it into the rally car / prerunner - esque ""Raid"" type. Meanwhile, feel free to do that to your Nissan Z! The whole MMO aspect, I'm not so sure of yet... mainly because it doesn't seem to be working correctly yet. In short, the game has a LOT of potential, and I'm enjoying it so far despite it's quirks. However, there are some improvements that are needed to make this game really shine.			",141,24,15,13,12,1,5

												Jacko Rating 7/10The Crew is the first MMO to do something different and use cars and driving instead of the usual aray of fantasy characters.It is an enjoyable mix of arcade/sim style racing with the added online benefits - namely being able to join and crew up with as many as 4 of your mates to race and cruise all over the USA.Strengths are definately the enjoyment you get out of messing about with your friends whilst in your hotted up car, the graphics are good for next gen but for the PC it could be better, 60 FPS on PC runs smooth enough, the sound effects from the cars are nice and beefy and last but not least the size of the map and drivable area is absolutely massive.The weaknesses are - its gets a bit laggy from time to time, there are not nearly enough visable players online making it not really feel like a MMO (at least not yet), not enough races on offer and the button mapping system is frustraiting when trying to really customize it.The final verdict after 42 hours of playing time is despite its flaws it is an addictive driving game especially when cruising around with mates but no substitute for a real racer (wait for Project Cars).  This is well worth your money if you intend to play with friends online and like a massive map of the USA to drive around but if you want a hardcore racer to post times and compete against mates then this will only annoy you.Pretty Good Game but could have been much better.

												So, here we go.I can see alot bad recommendations about it, but in my opinion its a great game. Lets start with a big map, i dont have seen so big map without loading points before, map is minilized version of real life Michigan, New York, Florida and California. There are also alot of cars with awesome classes and tuning, from stock to circuit, 5 classes in total. There are cars, pickup trucks and so on. (Season pass gives even more) Map is quite living, with citizens walking in cities and animals living in wild, trains move, aircraft, alot of traffic vehicles, emergency vehicles on duty and so on. Story is quite interesting, but little, but after finishing it, there are also alot of skills to do... and then awards (Each class of awards done gives you special nr plate). There are also landmarks, what locate an historical building or place with quick review of it from real life, i really liked to do these. (242 on total)  Cars have standalone levels to 1299, you unlock parts doing missions or skills, and then there is player level, up to 50. Snow mountains, where it gives your car more slippery, and fun to drift... also alot of racetracks and interesting places from real life US states, Salt lake drag strip and so on...  Cop chases are quite hard. Also each state has its own 20 car wrecks to collect, to get an hidden car for free.So... bad things about this game, you might meet some players in your session at each state.Crew invitation is still glitching around sometime, wont let somebody join... and PVP takes forever load, so... basically you drive alone... also friends i have in uplay, i never dont have seen them in my session, if only joined my crew.8 / 10.

												I loved the beta for this game. Tons and tons of detail were put into this and alot of time well spent. I let my friend who rarely plays racing games drive with a pc steering wheel I got and from him destroying the city we found some minor bugs. I really wanted to point out how getting from one place to another actually takes you onto the highway for a REAL cruise sometimes. These trips aren't 2 seconds down the road. When I wanted to get to NY City it took me a decent amount of time to get there by highway (probably about 15 minutes). I very much enjoy this aspect of the game because constantly racing your car and bashing through telephone poles in a racing game doesn't make me respect that racing reality. What really gets you to appreciate your car, in The Crew and in real life, is when you can drive it on the highway for a trip - destination after destination. When I got onto the highway in The Crew I felt even more confident in this game.			",44,1,0,1,3,0,5

THE CREW REVIEWImage of the in-game options[cloud-4.steamusercontent.com] Image of more in-game options[cloud-4.steamusercontent.com]Image of the World Map[cloud-4.steamusercontent.com]Image of an in-game event[cloud-4.steamusercontent.com] The Crew is not a good game. While the concept of the game sounds great, Ivory Tower fails to execute it well. The cars all feel similar (the performance cars all feel the same as each other, the raid cars feel the same, etc) and don't control as good compared to other driving games. The game borrows many ideas from previous Ubisoft releases that don't really translate that well in a car. The online community for this game may as well not be there. There is a chat in-game but in the 20+ hours I've put into this game I've yet to see one person use it.. which can make it hard for people to find a Crew to party with in-game. Invites to races and events other people usually go unaccepted. While a large portion of the Crew relies on having a Crew, the game doesn't have a whole lot to offer for people looking for a single player experience. The map for this game is huge and allows you to drive from the east coast of the United States to the west coast. In between are rocky mountains, open plains, wildlife darting across the road, cops, pedestrian vehicles getting in the way, little towns at the end of dirt roads and huge cities. In between all these are hundreds and hundreds (it seems like) of events. There's a handful of events such as staying in between the lines, smashing through 'gates', going as fast as you can, mountain climbing, and more. Completing these events (and other races) reward you with a score based on how well you did and are rewarded with different car parts than you can equip to cars; increasing their overall stats. Instead of climbing towers to unlock portions of the map; making you work a little for your progress, the Crew has you drive up to the satellite dishes located by a blinking aura on your map and GPS. The story is extremely dull, laughable and perdictable.You play as Alex, a man wrongly jailed for the death of his friend. You have the chance you redeem your freedom as FBI Agent Zoe sends you information on the man who killed your friend, and she believes the police officer, Coburn, who arrested you is working behind the scenes with Shiv. You must race your way to the top, earn your ink, and take down Shiv. The music is subpar, instantly forgettable and I found a hard time finding something I enjoyed listening to in-game.If you're interested in the Crew to get your racing game fix I would suggest looking elsewhere. There's plenty of other racing games out there that are multiple times better that'd you actually enjoy. Also, uPlay sucks.			",821,240,23,114,83,11,118

												As a causal driver not a big racing game fan, the Crew suits me well.The game engine seems not advanced, even a little bit outdated at your first look, but I'm just in love with this good old classic atmosphere, because the view, the building, the land describing are actually realistic. Beside, the CREW dev TEAM have made a big improvement on this game after the wild run and the call all units pack, the game's view is really getting better and better like the lighting, now there are huge differences compares to the original release version, which really seems dark and dull, but now I feel like it could catch up with the Horizon 3, which I don't feel like to play anymore, because the CREW has better atmosphere for casual drive.I really recommend you guys try to run it in 1440P,32 inch screen, you will feel much MUCH immersed and much detailed than in 1080P. For 1440P you just need a RX480 4G and a desktop i5 CPU, you will get 60fps at high settings most of the time. If have connecting issue, a VPN is recommended.This game is quite unique, you cant find any other game that cover the whole america. I could drive or wonder as far as I like, just to see the view, feeling relaxed. Once I all most cry in the the snow-covered mountain land cause the view is so breath-taking. At last I really hope Ubisoft can make a Chinese Version like those newly released Ubisoft games, excellent game like this should be known and enjoyed by more people.			",94,10,1,9,5,1,1

												I enjoy the driving and graphics in The Crew... also I hear a lot of people complaining on driving itself and what they have to go is open the settings and set ""Hardcore"" for assists, plus in some cases tune a bit...CONS:Even without FPS drops at steady 60fps everyone gets microstutters which don't affect fps (even if graphics is set to low).Ubisoft PLEASE FIX The MicroStutter so we can enjoy the game at its full!GameBreaking:Another issue is map texture load glitch when map stops loading and you are stuck in raw textures, usually it helps to use back to track button and the map loads, but sometimes it doesnt work and you have to restart the race (In races as Highway child and coast to coast) which makes it extremely frustrating as those are 50min-1:30hr long races.Will change to positive once microstutter and map load glitch are fixed...I mean it's been over a year now and I think it's time to fix it now!Year and a half...UPDATE: Released 19/12/2014 today is 17/08/2016 and they still didn't fix ""Map Load Bug""...Don't buy this pile of garbage.

												The Crew is everything I have hoped for in a racing game for years. It combines the fantastic customization options of Need For Speed: Underground with the thrill of the high speed chases of Hot Pursuit, as well as including more serious racing environments for fans of series like Forza and Gran Turismo, and even putting heavy focus on rallycross and extreme offroad racing.The storyline (at least as much of it that was included in the beta) was interesting the whole way through, even if it seemed like it was lacking in dialogue every now and then. The Crew offers a break away from the typical racing game storylines while still keeping you in the spirit of racing the whole time. The open world is enormous and has a lot of exploration and events to offer. The beta version included only the United States map, and I only had time to explore from Chicago to the east (and not even all of the east!). I don't know how much of the rest of the world will be included in the full release, but I am eager to find out come November. All in all, I give the game a SOLID 9/10. I'm nothing short of absolutely thrilled for the full release of the game, and would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone with remote interest in open world or racing games.			",512,124,14,52,61,6,64

												This game has got a massive amount of negative reviews... and to be honest is the best racer i have ever played.I did get the Gold version on sale so am reviewing at about a $40 price tag.Pros:Enough content to keep you playing for life (Skills/PvP/Faction and Story Missions.)Graphics - Buttery smooth on my setupOpen World (US scaled by Autodesk)The satellite animations zooming from map view to car and vice versa is damn sexyUpgrading of cosmetics and performance for cars is prettySkill level upgrading - driver and performance parts upgrading for carsCons:Main problem I have is that at the moment servers are packed with players but if UPlay or the Crew servers are down, you cannot play until they are back up. Physics of 'barriers' on collision can have the strangest effects at times like space shuttle launch type strange :) First impression: Bought a Camarro... took it out on the street thinking it was going to be me and some ai doing missions. Came across these 3 Russian dudes doing donuts in a side street... They invited me to their Crew and we finished the Story missions together and are working on faction missions. There is no language barrier for burning rubber and nitrous fumes.Each has their own impression ... for me this is 11/10 and supercedes NFS and Grid series with drawing me in and return value to the game.

												Tried my hardest to like this game.

												Fun for a couple of hours at most doing the storyline and collecting car bits, playing against online players reminds you that unless you pay real money to buy virtual cars you aren't going to do terribly well. Bought the season pass which didn't include the first actual piece of DLC that isn't a single car. Good job aiming for EA's title of worst price gouging company in existance this was my last ubisoft product.			",207,47,12,54,64,1,31

												I would say I absolutely do recommend this game if you like games like Test Drive Unlimited, and Need For Speed, that being said, there are some MAJOR downsides to this game but overall I find it a rather good game.Let's start with the cons to get that out of the way.   -Hard to Start OutAs in it's rather hard to get money for actual good vehicles. I feel as you progress more, it'll be easier but when you have to go and get performance vehicles.... be prepared to spend lots of your time grinding for money if you want an actual decent car.   -RankedI feel as though they let you go into ranked WAY too early as I went into it (Not at all knowing what I was doing...) and was matched with the top of the top players (Platinum, Gold, Etc.). While they had level 1499 Vehicles, i sat there with a puny level 300..... As that may be my own fault for rushing it, I just recommend if you play to wait a LONG time before playing ranked.   -Street ChallengesAs this may just be my own personal opinion, I find as you're driving down the road, the excessive amount of Street Challenges are way too much. They typically cover the entire road, and frankly try to force you to do them. You literally have to swerve off the side of the road to avoid them... Personally, I just find them annoying as they hardly reward you anything and are quite dull, typically trying to force me off the path I was originally going.    -Wild RunAs this isn't nessicarily a con to me, I find lots of people complaining since the season pass didnt include Wild Run. As I didn't pre-order or buy the Season Pass expecting it (Due to me buying the game far after the big fuss about it happened) I don't find this really a con since it's only $10 more. Though do be warned, season pass doesn't include ALL dlc like most games have it. It lacks a big item that the game basically requires and tries to force onto you, Wild Run.   -Basic Story PlotI won't spoil anything for you but, if you have ever played Need For Speed: Undercover.... This is basically that game. It has pratically the exact same plot and will give you extreme de ja vu.    -Bad Graphics...As this isn't such a big deal to me, the graphics for some things do make me laugh. The graphics for scratches are incredibly cheaply made... That's really all I have for that one... It's just rather funny how horrible they are. Now Onto the Pros  -Long StoryAt the time of writing this, I am 10.3 Hours into the game, and still not even halfway into the game. It seems to be VERY long which I absolutely love, something most games nowadays seem to lack.  -Some Nice CarsThere are some very nice, detailed cars in the game. Though expensive.   -EntertainingI've always been a big fan of Racing Games and I can say, this game I absolutely fell in love with. It's one game that I can actually sit down and play for a long while without getting bored, which is very few for me.     -ControlsOkay, This is moreso to personal preference but - The Controls for this game is rather different compared to most games. If you're using a controller, it may seem a bit weird just to how the handling is, but I can say after a while you will get use to it. I personally fell in love with it. I would probably rate this game 7/10... It could definitely be better, but It's still rather good. A nice relaxing game to come home to if you have nothing else to do			",160,16,3,28,19,1,8

												I'm sure most of you have already watched movies such as the Fast and Furious, right? Now, who wouldn't want to roleplay as a bunch of street racers out cruising on the city with pimped-out rides fighting for bragging rights?The Crew is an open world, online multiplayer arcade racing game that lets you crew up with people to challenge others all over five major areas in the United States. That single line alone got me hooked enough to take the game and see for myself. After several hours clocked in, I managed to pin-point a few things that make this game great, at the same time notice a few issues that could be resolved in the future hopefully.The Pros:- Probably one of the biggest selling points of this game is the fact that it's open world. They weren't kidding when they said, ""If you can see it, you can drive there"" part, with a minor exception from the world's boundaries. From busy streets, to wide highways, to rocky mountain tops, to the vast fields. You can race, or chill-out, practically anywhere given that you have already driven to that spot before. To add to this, the game allows you to warp anywhere with minimal to no loading time whatsoever. Always a plus on my book.- The rides aren't limited to your typical street racer tuning. The game has several specifications that works on certain terrain and objectives. It allows you to customize your ride to best suit the situation at hand, like dirt specs for off-road challenges, and raid specs for heavy duty pursuits. A large chunk of the pimping-out option is available as visual customization for your ride, allowing drivers to make unique rides that they can show-off to others, or look awesome winning in them during races.- This is a multiplayer game after all, so what could be more exciting than racing as a crew? Imagine cruising down the streets as a 4-man team out looking for trouble or a challenge. Visualize being chased down by cops while your crewmates dive right in to clear a path for you. Or you could just troll people around and block busy streets just for fun.The Cons:- No game is perfect after all, especially during its first launch, so don't expect too much or you'll just end up disappointed like some. While the game is labled as an MMO, players are divided into ""sessions"" much like RPG games have ""server channels"". Most of the time players see only a handful of people in their current session, sometimes no one at all. While I have no idea what are the maximum number of players per session is, it would be nice if I could see 20+ drivers or so in every coast. Not too much though, or it would be chaos. Some people are complaining about not being able to see their friends in-game as well to crew up, which is quite a let down.- AI in this game is quite annoying in my opinion. First of, the term ""rubberbanding"", in reference to the elasticity of a rubber band, means that car A will not move too far away from car B in most situations. For example, you're in a race wherein you're in first place. The 2nd place AI will ""rubberband"" its way towards you no matter what situation it gets stuck in. It will suddenly dive towards you at ridiculous speeds even if it had just recovered from a crash. It works both ways when you're the one at 2nd, the 1st place AI seems to slow down a bit to allow you to get back into the race. Imagine the ""rubberbanding"" on police vehicles, chases aren't as exciting as it should be. In fact, it's difficult and down right scary.- The physics and controls on this game is a little off, I think. I mean, yes, driving at high speeds have this tendency to lose control obviously. But the handling and recovery is just too darn difficult.  The vehicles tend to spin-out easily, lose traction and so on. Let's not get started on the police, especially when they decide to break in front of you, they turn into a solid brick wall you can't possibly push aside. On the plus side, however, these cops really know how to do pit manouvers and stuff. And I think the handling of the cars can be remedied with the right car parts. Just expect to have a hard time at the start though.All in all, despite the ups and downs, The Crew is still a fun game to have, especially if you love the challenge and the thought of having one awesome ride as an avatar. It's barely a week into release and I'm sure we can expect better things to come from this game. If you're debating on picking this up, my personal opinion is go for it.  I mean, why not? It's not a bad game, but it's not the best either, but I'm sure this game has potential to get up there on the list. Hope to see you guys on the streets. Later.			",81,5,0,12,3,0,5

												Find some people on Steam to play with and form a Crew. I have made 3 great new friends in the past 2 days from playing this game. Having people to play/cooperate/compete with makes this game so much fun, and you will always try to beat each-others records on trials and watch their tail during races. It is co-op, so if the objective is (for example that we found) to, say, finish 3rd or higher, and only one person in the event achieves it, you all get rewarded. I usually am the brute in our Crew, I drive a Dirt or Street spec'd Ford Raptor. I will keep the AI drivers at bay by ramming and cutting them off, and my friends will use their Skyline or Charger to win the race(Though the Raptor can perfectly keep up if I want!). We all have a role that we use to emerge victorious as a group, and the game really rewards teamwork.--There is so much I would like to write about, but I am tired (from playing so long). The driving isn't Asetto Corsa level, but if you want to have a blast driving, this game does it. I have had some times where the others went off line, and I just drove, and drove, and drove, and went to the coast, traveled to the mountains and hot-swapped for my Dirt-spec ride and tore up the ground all the way down the mountain.--If you have a steering wheel with force feedback, The Crew uses every ounce of it. I was a beta tester, and I was surprised that they had full support for my wheel, the Logitech Driving Force GT. It's not a mainstream wheel, it was designed for the PS3, but it works on PC with 900 degrees of rotation and force feedback. All the buttons work, I have not had to tweak anything. It just, WORKED.--Ask me anything you like in the comments, I would be happy to answer questions you have about the game.			",57,6,3,8,7,2,1

												I'm surprised this game doesn't seem to be getting the attention it deserves. It's hands down one of the best racing games I have played in a very long time. I played the beta and was impressed, but having played a lot yesterday I saw why they said ""Don't trust the hurried, rushed reviews for this game."" because things start getting even better as you go along.Doing one of the big weekly faction races is what finally put the ""this game rules!"" thought into my head, becauset there I was 25 checkpoints into a race with 110 checkpoints going all over the country when it dawned on me that this game isn't just about the quck pick up races and fancy cars, it's about skill and endurance. Not only that, it's sometimes just beautiful to look at as I've been guilty of just driving slow and looking around at the incredible world that Ivory Tower built.This game really shines when you are racing along the world in the drivers seat view, I switch when I need to but being In the drivers seat is where its at for me.I say this game is well worth the money. I look forward to playing even more.			",107,15,1,10,6,0,6

												##WARNING## HONEST REVIEW**{[READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU ARE EVEN LOOKING AT THIS GAME]}**Guys everyone who bought this game and said there arent enough cars is a lunitic because there alot of cars considering that you multiply that by 5 because every car has diferent car classes that make that car behave so much more diferently. Also the makers of this game (Ubisoft) are going to release 2 more car classes, motorcycles and better graphics.  The 2 new car classes are going to be drift cars and monster trucks. I have to comment on the graphics because the graphics are not the best (they will be inmproved) they are good enough graphics. Anyone who judges a game on graphics should really change there ways.**BOTTOM LINE THIS IS A GREAT GAME THAT WILL GET BETTER SOON**			",21,3,0,1,4,0,1

												The Crew represents what I personally missed in recent racing games. It isn't a racing simulator, so don't expect full realism while in the driver' seat, but what you get in terms of handling is more than enough to enjoy the fun. Simply put: there's a fair background story, many cars, a gazillion of races and an explorable map that is the whole U.S.A. territory; all of this is what makes The Crew a very good arcade racing game. Sometimes, though, the arcade model becomes too evident (yes, Raid-spec ""smuggling runs""... while also some PvP events...), but all in all this is an experience worth trying, especially if you plan to play it using a racing wheel set like the Logitech G27 (fully supported). If you're an old NFS fan and miss the good old Most Wanted times, here you'll find your new home.			",151,19,2,19,17,1,39

												I have been playing The Crew for about 2 hours.From a racing simulation point of view, the game lacks in various areas such as handling, physics, drivetrain, shifting. All vehicle handles nearly the same, with more or less understeer. Gearbox is odd, and slow while shifting/down shifting, handbraking is slow. On road, cars rarely spin out, but when pushing them to the limit, the cars will throw the rear end out, but refusing to turn. There are three modes of driving: All Assistance, Sport, Hardcore. All assistance would include ABS, Traction, steering stability, etc. Hardcore has less traction and less steering stability. Drifting is a pain in the ♥♥♥ on keyboard, but manageable on Sport and Hardcore mode.Tuning is simplified and a lot easier for the general audience, nothing too complicated. Parts are found during runs and story events, Gold, Silver, Bronze, each adding x amount of additional car level. Level cap for players is at 50. Level caps for cars are at 1299.From a car enthusiast point of view, for those who just wants to collect and drive the cars, and tune (not in-depth tuning), this game is great. Graphics are beautiful, damages to the vehicle is mildly realistic, environment is great. You wont be able to run over people though, just like that in Driver San Francisco, they would jump away with Level 9001 reflex skills. Engine sound effects on the cars come close to that of real cars, but only when not in cutscenes. Engine sounds from cutscenes souds like that of a muscle car, V6/V8. Collecters will still need to play the game and some events to make money, in order to mod the car. Game is Pay to Win or Play to Win.The R34 GT-R is left hand drive, which does not exist, and makes the petrolhead in me heartbroken.The Street Car upgrade in game gives a wheel (rim) which resembles 5Zigen Noir, which makes the Purist in me cry. Other recognizable brand of wheels (for those who care) includes: BBS (:D), HRE (:D), ROTA (D:), Volk Racing (:D) and of course, Original Equipment Manufacterer (OEM) wheels.All Street Cars are stock height, which makes me Iacrophobic.Game cannot be played with no internet connection, from what I've seen.Best part about the game is that they have a replica Pike's Peak Uphill/Downhill sprint run in the Midwest. Very fun to do a tandem drifting run up/down with a friend.Rate Game 6/10. It's not bad, but it's far from perfect. Definitely recommend for car lovers. Definitely a great game to go cruising around with friends and racing around town.			",237,37,35,41,35,1,36

												One of the best racing games I've ever played. Don't look at those ""Mixed"" reviews. Like 80% of negative reviews are like ""I pre-ordered The Crew + Season Pass and got no Wild Run DLC, clear scam."" Maybe, however I was smarter and just waited for the first steam sale. And there I go. After one and a half year, where the game was quite advanced I finnaly got my sale.The Crew Wild Run Edition for 30€.Now time for the actual review. The game has a decent storyline. The only thing that disappointed me, is it's linearlity. It is really linear, you genrally can't change anything, there are no decisions. For example I think that SPOILER ALERT:  You should have a choice of either killing Shiv or getting him caught by the police. Gameplay is great, PVP pays-off extremely and has some justice in it. For example, when you or someone other in the race have a lag, the game waits for you/him.I also think that there should be more Radio Stations and more tracks in them. Option to add your own radio stations like from GTA 3 Upwards should be supported two.Graphics are beautiful, car decorating options are great too.An overall of 8,9/10 for me, good job Ubisoft, one of your best productions...

												Unless you are rich like me, I really don't actually suggest this game.If you want to get anywhere, you gotta spend money.When the wild run expansion came out, it costed like 30 bucks here and you were literally just paying for 3 new specs, a bike, a drift car, and a monster truck. Why the hell is this not free? The Crew wasn't even released that complete, and then they lock off half the cars just to milk money.The game itself is actually pretty fun, but the handling needs to be adjusted in the options, and the map wasn't the ""whole america.""The selection of cars is very little and it's stupidly small added with the wildrun dlc.This game has microtransactions everywhere, and although it is pretty easy to make money in this game, it's obvious Ubisoft is a money milking corporation.The graphics are beautiful, though.TLDRUnless you have around 150 bucks, don't expect to get much content out of the game quicklyGraphics are good, and the map isn't really the ""whole america,"" though it's still pretty good.Kill yourself Ubisoft, why can't you design a game that doesn't milk money for once.

But its a new game, and i guess they will fix it with time.So what is good, and what is bad?Well i think its a really nice game, an open world car game. That you can play online in, its really cool to cruise around mount rushmore or just on the road with your friends. And even play against them.Something i want, is more cars, and more missions.The singleplayer is also pretty good, you play as a guy called Alex. And you are going to jail for 5 years. After the years are over, you work for the FBI and wanna get revenge on your brothers killer.To do that, you need to get a cool car, and go race against the 5-10!The game is good in itself, and i would recommend it if you like to cruise around.5/5			",622,180,19,64,59,9,85

												This game is worth every cent. I've played it with my friends in a crew of 4 and we could not stop laughing. You dont have to do missions all the time. In fact, I've spent the most of my time just rolling around with my friends because its SO MUCH FUN.			",68,8,3,6,7,1,1

												Awesome open world gameplay with more cars, parts, missions and collectables than you know what to do with. Drive, Race and Wreck your friends in high speed American roads or Crew up and take the Streets, replay old missions or PvP and Dominate the lobby. The choice is always yours in The Crew!

												I've clocked almost 50 hours in The Crew - an obvious recommendation. I am currently level 27 and still exploring the first of 5 regions (more about that later). Why is it fun?The Crew has a huge map, a huge number of difficult races and skill challenges, reasonable AI, the longest races I have ever seen in a computer game, a varied selection of cars right from the start, and a good system for levelling up cars, doing PvP, and doing co-op PvE with or without friends. It is a bit of a cross between FUEL (its game world is bigger, but emptier) and NFS:World (which has a more crowded MMO-feeling, but is pay2win and not as social). It has Burnout Paradise's ability to initiate challenges right in the game world without going to an instance, so you may be driving along and see a car flying through the air because you're passing a jump challenge and someone's doing it; or see everyone else's police pursuits (join in if you like).The level cap is at 50, there are 5 regions, you can go anywhere at any time, but the events and cars of a new region unlock every 10 levels. So in theory, since my main focus is still the first region (Mid-West - of course you start in Detroit), I shouldn't be over level 10, upgrading my car with level 1-10 parts won from skill challenges available in that region, and generally having a good time; and I should be able to level out of that region by following the storyline missions, if I like, which I probably am. But the game also provides other ways to level up: you can grind story missions (even accidentally, if you want to improve your score from bronze to gold; and the game also makes you, because other player will invite you on coop runs - of course you can decline), you can do faction missions once you are level 10 (out of curiosity), or you can do PvP (a dozen races was enough to get me from level 21 to 27). This will unlock other car types (good) and the parts sets that come with the level (bad, because I now could just buy me all level 20 parts for my car and skip the East Coast region altogether, and with a bit more PvP, skip the South, too). Maybe The Crew should have taken a slice from GuildWars, where you're a) PvP-ready from the beginning with competitive gear (but you can use your own high-end PvE gear as well), and b) levels and player capabilities are adjusted on the fly depending on the level of the region you're in so that co-op works well.Right now, I exercise some restraint and explore and do the skill challenges and the exploration anyway, and the nice thing about The Crew is that even though my cars are somewhat overpowered for the zone (what with the stat boost levelling up gives them -- why, exactly?), the challenges are still tough to get golden. At the rate I'm going, there'll be many more hours of fun in this game.If I could do it over, I would play each story mission only once and stay away from anything social (PvP, Factions, co-op) until level 40 at least. Recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So...... you like to drive huh?Thats what this game has to offer. Its truly not some entirely new racing experience. Its midnight club, burnout, need for speed, all rolled into a new game, The Crew. Many people have criticized this game for its sub-par graphics, arcade like driving/physics, and it not being a true ""MMO"". And while that may be true in many cases, you also must take into account for the scale of this game. No other game truly allows you to drive from Miami to LA in one sitting all the while seeing every different biome along the way. It's fulfilling to be able to go from a small town, to the mountains, to main roads, and then to main cities. I will admit that this game is far from completely polished but that does not mean its fun and enjoyable. I have around 50 hours right now and while around 25 of that was the main story, the rest has been me farming the skill missions and overall, trying to explore the massive world of The Crew. So in the end, yes you might not be getting a perfect game, but its still one to remember, and it will continue to get better with patches, dlcs, etc etc.			",76,6,1,9,8,0,10

Must buy at any price [x]
Worth the money but wait for a small sale [✓]
Wait for a huge discount [x]
Avoid at all costs [x] INTRODUCTION The Crew, a game made by Ivory Tower which are former Test Drive developers, Test Drive was a good game loved by many so everyone had alot of high expectations for The Crew (very high expectations) which is why some people were disappointed, for over-hyping this.That doesn't mean The Crew is bad though, it's an open world (very open world with no invisible walls, except a huge wall beside Mexico) racing game, it has a story , official cars with a wide variety, replayability, but you may ask ""Isn't it once you finish The Crew it's done?"" yes it does, BUT , you can buy very low level cars and feel like it's a new run again. CARS I think we all had huge hopes for good cars, Ivory Tower didn't fail us...The game has around 40-130 cars (I couldn't find an exact number, these are the lowest and highest numbers of cars people told me about) , It has a huge variety of manufacturers going from Spyker to Lamborghini to Fiat ect.It's got all the cars we love, all the popular and even forgotten car manufactureres.You get ""Specs"" which are modifications for your vehicles, the specs are: Fullstock, Street , Dirt , Performance , Raid , Circuit. With DLC: Drift , Monster truck , Drag , Cops. STORY Nothing special, it's a racing game it doesn't require an in-depth story but we got one, without it the game would be a little odd but luckly we got one. You and your brother belong to the street racing network 5-10, it's illegal but popular, you and your bro go to meet the top dog, he kills your brother but you were accused of it as the cop leader was bribed with ALOT of money, you were sent to jail for about 5 years until you're partnered undercover with the cops, climbing the ladder to the top, going through leaders of spec vehicles , making them your friends until eventually, you're on the top with the killer, you confront him in a club, about to shoot him but you're smart enough not to, you do one last race with him, defeat him and he disappears, the cop leader gets jailed and you live happily ever after. OPEN WORLD The world is completely open, no invisible walls, nothing.You see a cliff in the playable area, you can go to it, the world is detailed and intresting , with sadly few easter eggs but fun ones, the world has some real race tracks and cities, the world is huge and it would take some time following 1 specific road from one end of the map to the other. GRAPHICS They're nice, especially in photo mode (check my profile for some screenshots), but they're pretty demanding, on my overclocked GTX 950 2gb vram I can run with SSAO+ , FXAA and mostly high settings at 60fps mostly at all times.Photo mode is beautiful, fell in love with it. PHYSICS They're weird, your car is stuck to the ground which is sadly annoying (can't go crazy with cliffs) but for overall driving feels good, you can play on ""normal, sport , hardcore"" modes which enable tc, disable tc ect.Drifting feels good, racing at high speeds does, collision is choppy but can deal with it.

												I was really excited for the release of this game, and I NEVER take the time to review games, ever. But this one enraged me to the point I have to let people know to NOT buy this game. no doubt I will combust any moment for wasting my hard earned money on this pile of pixles so Ill just keep it simple and make a list of the issues. only 3 for me, because I only got past the TUTORIAL. And dont get me wrong, Ive spent more time messing with settings than playing the game to know my issues are real.1. FIVE times before you get into the gameplay they make it very apperent they want you buying wildrun DLC, this is stupid, was my 30 dollars not good enough?. 5 times I got advertisments shoved in my face before playing. not the point of a game.2. the camera snapping back uncontrollably to the forward position anytime W is pressed, now I understand why this is needed, GTA did a good job of this, smooth transitioning back to front view. the crew snaps you back when your trying to look left or right and it freaks out when you try to look anywhere but directly forward. This is a car game. I want to look at my car, and look where I want to go. not just straight. this was a game breaker for me 100%.3. after spending even more time tinkering with the steering controls, I for some strange reason couldnt tell I was driving a Camaro. I thought I was steering a bus. Game was unplayable for mydelf due to these very annoying features, dont get me wrong if these 3 things dont bother you, I hope you enjoy the game. Im just trying to save peoples time if they share my opinion.0.0/100			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I loved this game and have so much, i plan on getting all cars, acivements, DLC, rewards, and anything else i can get out of it. I will reach 1,000 hours playing this game soon and keep going. This is the best game that has come out so far. Right up there with forza horizen 2, except for PC. I have never got bored of this and still have allot of places to see in america. i learned allot about this contry from this game and saw the lands beauty first hand (digitaly). the landscape is amazing and the new Wild Run expansion doesnt come out for a few months. I love when costomization is supirior and unlimited. This is the only game that will give you the ability to drive formula 1 cars, track cars, rally cars, common street cars, armored cars, monster trucks, drift cars, drag, and moterbikes open world anywere you want. Btw, the bikes will have those specs too.This arcade racer is the best for doing almost anythig, me and my freinds love to just go on top of a mountain and drive off the cliff and see who lands farthest, other times we try to smash every one who is landing from a ramp jump. They think its funny too because thay're not in any kind of race, just exploring. I made freinds that way too xD.the PvP events are also good because you never have 3-6 year olds saying stupid stuff like on COD, and racing isn't the only kind of PvP thing, there are many game modes like the most recent is crown, aka capture the flag. and people are respectfull, if there is somone in the same faction i sometimes defend and give them the win since you get allot of money no matter how much you win, winning PvP just raises your faction level, witch is good but at least you get allot of moneythe best part is, is the game actually starts when the story is finnished, when you hit level 50 that when you really play. and the updates are awsome, new car evry month, and patches to fix bugs all the time. Add this to your wishlist and the next time it goes on sale, get it. this game is awsome.			",34,0,15,3,2,0,0

												8/10 - Fun, addictive game with lots of growth potential.  I gave it a 8/10 instead of a 10/10 because the game isn't easy to learn or it's not user friendly and it needs more cars; there are only a little more than 200 cars available in the game.  That said once you learn how to play, this game is amazing.  'The Crew' reminds me of my beloved racing game Gran Turismo, but much better and with traffic, an open world and random weather.  I played Gran Turismo 1-5, I'm familiar with the game and engine, this game is most definately built off the same platform.  The vehicle modifaction system has been changed and the game has a story with a plot as well as being massively multiplayer.  You're allowed to play all the game's different modes in a ""Crew"" or a 4 man team of your friends.  When you start out you have a choice of cars available at the Detroit car dealer.  As you unlock the game by beating story missions, there are 5 car dealerships and 1 motorcycle dealership.  I recomend starting with either the 2011 Mustang GT or the Nissan 370Z as they have several different specs the vehicles can be tuned to.  Much like Gran Turismo the vehicles are rated based on what 'The Crew' calls vehicle levels or Gran Turismo players know as performance points.  There are several different spec's a full stock car can be tuned to.  The game comes with 5 specs.  To unlock 'extreme specs' you need to purchase the 'Wild Run' upgrade.  Standard Specs:1 - Street2 - Dirt3 - Performance4 - Raid5 - CircuitWild Run 'Extreme' specs:A - Monster TruckB - DriftC - Dragand a new vehicle type: Motorcycles... which kick ♥♥♥ by the way.  Each spec a vehicle is tuned to can level up by unlocking parts via challenges, game missions or PVP events thus increasing it's performance point rating.  1299 is the max vehicle level/performance point rating available at this time.  As you complete missions new areas unlock, new vehicle specs and new vehicles are available.  The best way to earn money, rep and league points is to PVP.  It's by far the best way to earn money and rep.  You compete against other players based on how much you play, not how well you finish in races.  You have a choice of 5 PVP factions you can join.  The wolves, the snakes, the gators, the eagles, and some other faction that isn't memorable.  Your rep is compared to the rep of the other players in your faction.  If you have the highest rep in your faction, you're the boss and get a base salary of $150,000 per day.  If you're not the highest paid player, like most people, you fall somewhere in the middle.  Underboss = $100,000 daily, Street Boss = $60,000, Lieutenant = $30,000, Thug = $10,000.  I don't remember what Gangsta pays, but it isn't much, maybe $5,000 daily??  Yes finishing in 1st place pays better, but the difference between 1st and 8th isn't much.  The Devs encourage people to PVP with this system.  Traffic and collisions can be turned off to enhance your gaming experience.  Every player in the PVP lobby gets to choose what map they would like to race on.  Then based on what the players chose (5 players, 5 maps) the computer randomly selects one of the maps all of the players in the lobby chose and then everyone races on that map.  You can PVP solo or with a crew (4 man team).  To start I recomend the 2011 Mustang GT or the Nissan 370Z.  Both of these cars can be tuned to Street, Dirt, Raid, Performance or Circuit which is why I recomend them.  Money is tight early on in the game.  My recomended cars/bikes:Street: KTM 450, Nissan GTR, 2015 Mustang Fast BackDirt: KTM 450, RUF 3400K, HummerRaid: KTM 450, RUF 3400K, Buggy, HummerPerformance: Ford GT, Mclaren F1, Pagani Huayra, Lamborghini Superlegera, BMW 1000RR, Ferrari 458 SpecialCircuit: Ford GT, Lamborghini Superlegera, BMW 1000rr, Ferrari 458 Special			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Crew is one of those racing games that you just have to play even if it has Ubisoft's name on it. Let's get all of the BS rumors out of the way by saying UBISOFT DID NOT DEVELOP THIS GAME!!!! Ivory Tower developed this game with the ability of having 60 FPS at the start and yes it does have micro transactions but earning in-game cash is super easy. This game isn't tanted with Ubisoft's bad pc port mojo. This is a super stable game and I occasionaly experience a crash once or twice a day.So gameplay, how is it? Well the gameplay is well how any Need for Speed from Underground 2 through Carbon but with a twist. This game has RPG elements thats similar to Need for Speed World but is not purposly asking you to empty your wallets into a pay wall. It is open world and the world is really huge. It is close to 50 in-game miles and it will take you a long time to get you there. You have a level (50 is a max) in which you level up by doing story missions (yes it has a story), skill challenges, PvP events, and faction missions. The story missions is what it is labeled as, missions that's part of the story. The skill challenges offer a way to gain car parts (more on that later) and get some experience for doing it. There is also a leaderboard so you can compete against a person's ghost and see if you can get to the top of the leaderboard. PvP events are what it is labeled. You go against other players and you can choose to fight for your faction or just free-for-all. Faction missions are where you get a lot of money, faction experience in which that adds everyday you login, and some chunk of experience. They also have one hour long races and one that goes up to 4 hoursWhat are these car parts you mentioned above? Well those car parts give your car a level as well ranging from 0-1299. The car parts consist of a motorcore, air system, diff, tires, weight reduction, and more. There are five classes of cars and each car class is different to each other: There is Street, Dirt, Performance, Raid, and Circuit. Street is your step above stock. Dirt is something you would see from a World Rally Championship. Performance is your step above Street but is almost stripped out. Raid is something you see from the Dakar Rally and yes they have trophy trucks. Circuit is something you see from Grand Touring ot 24 Hour Le Mons racing. The car is completely stripped down with weight saving and high performance in mind with the ability to take corners.Well since this is a driving game, how are the physics? The physics can be odd but if you work around them, you can win a lot of the races. Drafting is a thing so use it when you can. The cars will tend to bounce off of things like bumper cars and it focuses a little on drifting.Hows the car customization? It is what you would expect from a Need for Speed Most Wanted and Carbon game. You can customize the interior with your choices of aluminum, carbon fiber, mixed aluminum, and mixed carbon fiber. You cannot place stickers anywhere you want to though. They have presets which look cool IMO.Car selection? How big is it? Well IMO it is small but it will slowly expand with DLC. The car list consists of 58 total cars but at least they have trucks.Final thoughts? Well I am enjoying the game. I am enjoying every bit of time I have put into the game. I would recommend everyone getting the Season Pass since they are going to add more cars. January 2015 is going to be their first DLC which should be an interesting one. I did wish they have given us the ability to move around the stickers rather than give us presets and working mirrors in the cockpit (yes a working cockpit). This game I believe will set a new standard on the illegal arcade street racing genre that was leaving a sour taste in my mouth because of the way Need for Speed has been going and from the look of things, it isnt going to get any better. You just have to play this game to know what I feel about this game. I have been dying to play a game thats open world with similar car customization as Need for Speed Most Wanted and Carbon but isn't trying to make your wallets screem and this is the answer my friends.UPDATE: Next Tuesday of updating this review, they are adding three more cars into the game if you don't count the Mini Cooper non-street edition we got at launch. I havent experienced any big crashes. Loading the game will freeze your computer if you are using a controller with XInput. I still would recommend this game. The AI can have some stupid rubber banding but AI can be difficult in a racing game.			",119,6,30,7,9,0,2

												One of the most underrated racing games I've played. So much content that doesn't require real money to unlock and an online system that actually makes the game more fun. The cars are amazing, the graphics are good, and the gameplay is fun. The map is gigantic. My only complaint would be that I think the game would be better if the map was smaller and consisted for more winding roads like what you see when you hit the mountain areas. The map is really huge, but because of its size, a lot of the roads are straight and boring. I also wish the performance upgrading was more in dept instead of just having your car stats upgraded when completing races and challenges. I'd like it if I could pick my own exhaust, turbos, and other parts by brand and each having its own pros and cons in terms of how it effects your cars performance.I give it an 8/10.

												I LOVE the game now a lot and Highly recommend it!! It is The Whole U.S. in Small mode. Top of my list in Massive MP driving games.The cars are beautiful and exotic, customizable. (Please avoid all those Tramp Stamp Stickers and goofy Colors though... Tasteless Teens!) This game is genius in design, years in the making from half the TDU2 Crew I heard.  It avoidsall the annoyances of TDU games and Burnout Paradise etc. The landscape is STUNNING in detail and activity. Also, best complete the game with the new Police addition. Don't be CHEAP,  support this effort and maybe there will be MORE additions! This is a long term keeper. Definately get the Ultimate pack as all those extras like cars and modes are going to be a must. I love taking each car and motorcycle in my ""Hot Wheels"" collections ha ha and customizing paint the jobs and interiors, wheels, on and on. Check your Uplay Overlay and use those bonus points to unlock great stuff and cars in game and check your Monthly Challenges for easy big bucks.  Opening up the U.S. and seeing all these famous places very nicely done like no other before is intoxicating. I love to look and all the cut scenes in landmark locations ...all 248 of which will net you $500,000! Getting Daily Cash from Faction on booting is great.  My NAT is Moderate and works fine. I ""Rooted Manually"" as they call it in Start Menu correctly, (port forwarding or allowing pinholes through the Router Firewall settings for 5 Uplay ports and The Crew ...but still Moderate NAT. It made the game play worse it seemed, so I when Router Firewall default again. Clicking  DMZ will probably give me NAT OPEN, but then you have to depend on your Software Firewall and Anti-Virus etc to protect your computer from hackers! Game can lock up here and there requiring Windows key or ALT TAB or Ctrl Alt Del to Task Manager close game, Uplay or Steam Bootstapper to end, but I don't care anymore.My Driving Force GT wheel, (with a strip of Scotch Extreme Fastener velcro type tape in front to hold it on table strongly...wheels get loose and pull off!), works perfectly now with all buttons assigned just right and Wheel settings tuned well. My Track IR works with it. You can heard all sorts of languages from all over the globe commenting during chases as you can speak to players it seems. ( I found that an ability in all other versions of this game except Steam version is Blocked. One cannot purchase CC: Crew Credits in any way and this bug or block has been going on for years. I was given my bonus 110,000 Crew Credits and blew them all on Cars and upgrades.  Read in tips that it is best to use these for buying more Perk Points ideally. I clicked to buy $50 Platinum CC 600,000 as a shortcut wimp,  not needed,  the forum is right, the game is VERY generous and you do not need to buy CCredits. I must have bought 75 cars in just a few days. If you study all aspects of the game and look at guides on You Tube, it is easy to make $. Find all those 30 Data Stations...did in couple hours.)Totally Hooked on this game.			",165,3,35,2,12,0,1

												Best Racing game of the year. Ubisoft has done it this time and at last.I've been really mad at Ubisoft cause of it's crappy policy and marketing strategy, Watch_Dogs , Far Cry 4 and Unity. These games were expensive and not good as they look like. I was thinking about how worse Ubisoft can be, but even though I have these thoughts, still I made no prejudgement and watched stream on steam, talked with some friends about buying and forming our crew, and there I am driving across USA from East Coast to West Coast while feeling freedom and joy. The Crew is awesome.I was a racing-game lover when I was a kid. Played Midtown Madness, Most Wanted a lot and  loved those games. And here, in The Crew , gives me that joy. You can free ride all over the Usa, discover hidden car parts that unlocks a hidden car ( each from different regions ) or landscapes and antennas , similar to Creed Franchise. Then you can do challenges to receive car upgrades to increase your car level just like in MMO's , and the best part? Forming your own crew and driving together. I hope Ubisoft won't ruin this game and keep it updated with new cars, new stuff. The Crew is highly recommended for racing-lovers, people who used to play racing games and who likes Forza Horizon.Oh , forgot the best part. While driving around in L.A. and sun sets, it's best to listen to Arctic Monkeys - Do I Wanna Know , and hit it, One for the Road.10/10 Ubisoft makes me wanna cry.			",261,49,3,46,13,1,15

												Its a standard NFS(need for speed) game. I wouldnt say its straight arcade style but its not a simulator. Works well with steering wheel/pedals/shifter combo and if you have those items, you can feel the sim part of it while driving around the open world trying to decide what race style your in the mood for and it seems they have a vehicle for everyone with the ability to upgrade performance and looks. Enjoy online racing? You will probably enjoy this if you do.			",377,75,20,54,126,5,66

This game has taken EA's Need for Speed series out of the business once for all.For me, this could probably be the game of the year, from a considerable small choice list. THIS is how Need for Speed should have been for 10 years and counting (talking about NFSU and NFSU2 as best in the series, don't get me wrong). THIS is what modern racing games should aspire to. THIS is an example of a great ""racing"" game campaign (you don't get to play only racing missions, but also takedown, escape, time attack, contrabands and so on). THIS is an example of a good open-world game concept, as you're always busy with something, there's no such thing as boredom in this game, only if you're low on imagination. The bugs? They're pretty minor and unnoticeable at the moment of release. You can see a deer stuck in some fences, whatever. There's no game without bugs and here's nothing preventing you from playing.The graphics? They're good. I don't mind calling them great as they perfectly fit a strong 2014 game engine. There are enough graphics options, and also do not think that the game is locked to 30 FPS. We can also expect graphics mods in the future.The PC performance? Not bad, I must admit. The system requirements are pretty ""fair"", but whatever, even a low-mid spec laptop can beat this game on low settings. I didn't experience any sort of stuttering, FPS drops, all this kind of stuff.The handling? Feels good to me. You can say it's bad if you played any other good handling games, but you easily get used to the car handling. Might sound funny, but in cockpit view it feels even better to me.Buy the game and don't mind about the cons, you won't get disappointed.			",412,138,19,77,53,10,68

												I followed this game for quite a while before it came out. I was super psyched for a racing game with car customization in an open world, something Need for Speed has not done for a while now. However, I will admit that once it came out, I never really heard anything about it. It seems like I basically forgot. Then, a friend of mine got it and I ended up buying it on sale. Clearly, as you can see from my hours, I really have enjoyed this game. However, it has some serious quirks to it, and they aren't necessarily good. So, here's what I enjoyed about The Crew, and not so much.PROS:The Open World - I didn't realize just how big the map was until I really got into this game. It has, by far, the largest map out of any racing game I have played. I cannot compare it to FUEL simply because I have not played it, but it is bigger than every NFS game. And best of all? The map is not repetitive. You can drive from the swamps of the south to the deserts in the west, and have different scenery and small towns/cities in between. It mainly revolves around 5 major cities, and they are New York, Chicago, Miami, Las Vegas, and L.A. The developers certainly did their homework when it comes to the cities, and I applaud them for it. Even after 260 hours of gameplay, I still see places on the map I have not been, making the open world my favorite part of the game, by far.PvP - I find that the PvP is well done. You play in a lobby with up to 8 players at a time, who all choose exactly what event they want to do, and then the game randomly picks one of them. This includes events with any of the 5 specs. Some events are elimination, others regular races, and others a ""king of the hill"" type game. What's even better is the amount of in-game money you get from PvP. Even if you get last place, you still get nearly just as much money as the person in first, and this can make it enjoyable for anyone that plays. PvP is the best way to make money, currently. However, it still does matter what place you get, since there are PvP ranks in the game. The higher you place, the faster you rank up.The Graphics - Towards the end of 2015, a free update brought in new, updated graphics along with a weather system, which also includes slick roads after rain. This is all much better than before. Unfortunately, my lower-end GPU cannot handle max graphics, however, that is not to say that the game still looks very nice on High. It now looks more like a game released this year. Also props for it being a completely free update!Car Selection - You can have (almost) anything, from a LaFerrari, to a Hummer H1 Alpha, to a Dodge Challenger. What I like is that the game has 5 different specs for most cars (some ranging from just 1 spec to all 5), which are Street, Dirt, Performance, Raid, and Circuit. Take, for example, the Challenger. It can have all 5 specs, so if you want to go on dirt roads with one, you hop into the dirt spec Challenger. If you want complete offroading, you go with raid. And if you want to take it to the track or go extremely fast on highways, you get the circuit spec, and so on. What's nice is that you only buy one Challenger, and as you progress through the game, you get it in each spec, so you technically have 5 Challengers.NEUTRAL:The Police - I always enjoy it when there is law enforcement in an open-world racing game. At this point, I think it should be mandatory. The Crew, of course, has police, but they are only decent. Nothing more and nothing less. Unfortunately, this is where Need for Speed does something better than The Crew. During a police chase, even with 5 stars, there will never be any more than 5 police cars at once pursuing you, which by the way, are quite easy to take out. The roadblocks are laughable, since they never use anything other than the cars that are pursuing you to block the road, so you can usually speed right through them, unlike NFS: Most Wanted, which eventually has SWAT trucks that basically force you to take another route. There are also no spike strips. While it still can be fun to get into chases and have a friend taking out cops for you, I believe it could be made significantly harder at 5 stars with the use of bigger vehicles and spike strips.Customization - I'm very thankful that The Crew actually has customization to begin with, but it is really lacking. For one, you cannot choose from any color in the spectrum; you just pick from a preset list of colors. Second, the decals are mostly terrible. I tend to use the same 10-15 decals on most cars, or sometimes not at all, because most of the others are just bad looking and don't seem to fit any vehicle. Granted, that is personal preference, but for someone who has played NFS:Most Wanted and Underground 2, those are far superior in customizing.CONS:Uplay - I think you saw this coming. I know I did. Uplay is a requirement for The Crew, even if you buy it directly from Steam. You must download Uplay, and you must create an account. Although it can run in the background for the most part, the matter of the fact is that it is extra DRM that no one really wants, especially someone like me that only has 1 Ubisoft game. It also contributes to a longer startup time.The Story - Full of clichés and it being overall boring, the story is pretty much mandatory in order to reach level 50. The movie-like cutscenes in it are neat, but if you are like me, you'll do the story just to get it out of the way. The fun seems to come after it's over with.Smart Loot - This system is possibly the worst addition to The Crew since launch. Granted, before it was added, people still complained about the grinding system for leveling up your vehicle. Now, however, it is much, much worse. Instead of what used to be a much quicker, platinum only part grind where you could go up as much as +50 spec points in a single jump, is now down to as little as +1 for the same skills. Not to mention you also have a chance of winning a customization part, such as paint, or a bumper. This makes it very hard to get your car to 1299 (the max spec level), if you weren't a player before Smart Loot was added.Closing ThoughtsDespite some big flaws, I have enjoyed this game a lot, and I would say it's in my top 5 racing games now. The Crew, to me, earns an 8/10. If you can look past the cons listed above, I do recommend this game to any person that enjoys racing games, or is looking to try the genre in general.

												I bought the game at launch, or a couple days after, here's my takeWHEEL USER'S REVIEW (Sim racer's point of view)The Crew does many things well:-Endless driving across the US-Decent feel through a T500RS (with the extraconfig.xml file you can find through ISR or Racedepartment)-Lenghty game overall-Though dated, looks nice-CarPG-Discoverables-Useable physics for low level cars (preferrably street or dirt specs primarily)However there's major things that this game does NOT do well:-Lateral grip loss (bad for drifting, though drifting isn't impossible)-HIgher level cars get more and more unrealistic, to the point where wheel users won't enjoy-Cops are....well, they don't matter, until they unrealistically and impossibly DO matter out of nowhere-The umpteen amounts of over-the-top ""LOOK AT ME I AM STREET RACORZ"" bling bling-Cut-scenes for every single action-New muffler part;  BRAKING BONUS!!!-Users without Calling All Units have major issues with constant annoyance to buy DLC, as well as friend disappearing when cops give chase, or simply alert that you have a slight bounty against them-Occasional drop-out of co-op missions-Honestly lame sound overallIt's a game I recommend to wheel users but ONLY if you're ok with using only half the content.  For wheel users specifically, once you get cars to a high enough level, or start using the higher specs of tuning, it becomes more and more arcade and unuseable for wheels.  It's not completely useless, but it definitely makes it more bland the more you progress.  The game's FFB (even with extraconfig.xml) strength is determined by vehicle weight, so the lighter the vehicle, the less FFB there is entirely.  Trucks and heavier vehicles naturally have more strength in the wheel overall.The FFB on the GOOD side, is pretty decent.  There's communication going on, and opposite lock (catching slides or drifting) is, in fact, there.  It's redeeming in itself, for a CARPG.On the BAD side, well, I've already mentioned the weight, but on Dirt, those forces nearly double overall.  It's rough on Dirt.  Some might complain due to lack of consistency, some might like it actually.  I kind of like it.The physics are....arcade, with a slight touch of realism.  At the lower levels, cars feel mostly natural.  On the higher levels, they float with total disregard for gravity and grip limits (HANDLING BONUS!!!).  Breaks are way too strong and acceleration is too fast.  The tires spin wildly, trying to impress somebody, yet nothing is happening on the driver's point of view.  Just generic wheel spin.  Still, there's a level of conservation needed to keep yourself from dying.  Snow is more fun to me.  I spent the entire game making sure I got as little HANDLING BONUS!!! BRAKING BONUS!!!....bonus's as possible.The sound is pretty lame.  Cars sound...well decently accurate, at least some.  They aren't terrible, but there's nothing to write home about.  Car engines are quiet overall, there's major leveling issues across the board and I don't play with music either.  Overall, it gets the job done, but don't expect to be wow'ed.  Some cars (namely Nissan Skyline R34) have pitch attenuation issues.Online portion is a dream come true....except for the fact that it's not.  Co-op is an awesome edition and cruising endlessly with friends is TRULY the meat of the game.  However, co-op doesn't mean anything, especially when you convince a friend to buy it so you can play together.  You already have all these tuned up cars that decimate the low level missions while your friend is feeling inadequate.  People disappear every time a cop chase is initiated, or you're alerted that cops are watching for you (or a friend).  Just left with a jittery name tag floating around.  It's annoying.  It works, it's not impressive, the concept is great, implemented rather poorly (but not so bad it's unplayable).  PVP matches are unbalanced, and for a wheel user, is not worth it honestly.  Once you max out your car's level through miscellaneous challenges, it becomes an arcadey mess, completely focused on top speed.Graphics are pretty nice.  There's nothing super amazing or perfect.  I'm running tripple screens and, though it doesn't support all the bells and whistles of simulators, it does have an FOV slider that works well.  I can't complain overall.  Looks pretty good, plays nice with peripherals it seems.Input device support:  I'm running a T500RS with a Basher boards FL2 adapter to run a G27 shifter on a seperate USB.  Works fine.  Took a minute to set it up.  Seems to be fine.  Like I said, I'm running tripples and it adds to the game greatly.  Though it won't quite run maxed with this setup smoothly.  980 4gb i5 3570 with 8GB RAM.Story:  I don't care.  I never will care.  You can't make me.  I've already gone through the NFS underground and beyond stories and I just plain don't care at all.  Well told I suppose, but flashy and stupid all the same.I recommend this game only because, as a wheel user with tripples and stuff, at the lower levels, this game is a great experience.  Endless driving exploration, co-op, driving with friends, just plain screwing around, drifting in Montana, some customization (though slightly limited in a way).  Stock, Street, Dirt, Raid and somewhat, Performance specs are fun to play with.  Beyond that wheel users won't have much fun with the floaty ""super handling/braking"" crap of the lighter cars.  It's fun having a 400hp Fiat 500, blasting away at RUF's and Zonda's like it's nothing.  The extraconfig.xml is absolutely necessary for good FFB overall.  It's hard to recommend otherwise, as there's obvious issues with the overall package, but still, it IS fun.  This is all outside the ""review"" of DLC and other things, which is complete BS overall.  I won't get into details, but DLC ruins some of the experience, unless you have money to throw away and get it all (then you won't have the game constantly pushing you to buy more things, as well as the online portion having less issues as a result).7/10:  Great concept, good open world exploration, bad end game, 50-50 for wheel users (dependant on vehicle class and level), horrible over-the-top-trying-to-impress-you fan service.

												It's a bloody mess.I have to admit that I fell for the ""we'll listen to the community feedback"" lie, genuinely thinking that this game would go in the right direction.But it didn't. It went straight into a DLCfest.The season pass doesn't grant you access to all the paid content, Wildrun isn't part of it, and on top of that, it costs almost as much as the game itself.Plus, it gives so little content that it makes no sense to pay that much: a bunch of bikes, new specs made with recycled and/or slightly edited assets and a new gamemode which should be competitive, but in reality it's just about who glitches the most.The physics are broken, the cars don't feel alright at all. The steering capabilities also differ depending on input peripheral, with DirectInput ones having increased precision and steering radius, while keyboard and Xinput pads users get impaired controls. This issue hasn't been fixed, despite being a hot topic on the game's forums.Vehicles aren't many for today's standards and they're terribly unbalanced. While updates fix the handling of some cars, all they do is changing the current kings. On top of that, bikes seem to dominate in almost any spec and they're locked behind a paywall. Despite the major outcry on the forums for more balance, nothing seems to have changed yet. Moreover, the engine sounds are terrible.The only saving graces of this game are the graphics and the game world.			",135,5,14,9,7,0,5

												Although i don't have as much playtime on this as some others, there is a lot to be said about the first impression of the game. Pros:Maps are richly detailed, i actually had to turn down settings so it wouldn't lag as much.Cars are nicely detailed, drivers side view allows you to look from side to side just like in real life.Good number of players aroundRacing is fun, although this has its own mechanics and an entirely arcade feel. It essentially feels like an early NFS title in how it handles. Think Underground 2 or Hot Pursuit 2.Cons: Glitchy! Sometimes you can ram a car hard, and the game will act like it was just a scratch, other times you will tap a car on the side lightly, and crash as if you rammed them. Speed of hit does not seem to matter.Microtransactions : YES, this does have microtransactions, although i do not see the need to buy cash unless you want to progress faster. It isn't quite as bad as i have seen in many games with a pay2win aspect. Not worth the base value. I waited for this to go on sale, do not buy this at full price. I don't think this is worth $60 let alone $85 for the Gold. Uplay: You must log in via Ubisoft's Uplay platform seperatly or make an account with them. Hackers and Griefers: Don't bother with the leaderboards.Handling: Normal racing mechanics do not seem to apply in this game. If you can get past the cons, there is some fun to be had in exploring and doing missions. Personally, i enjoy what i have played so far. Get it on sale.			",101,87,17,28,3,0,6

												Game is shoddy at best. Another blatant cash grab by Ubisoft. Ubisoft deserves to go bankrupt at this point. I would be okay with this game if it weren't for the process used to level up your cars. You need to do challenges to gain better parts, but the reward system is an ubelievable level of stupid. Rewards are randomized so it doesn't matter if you barely scraped out a platinum or absolutley crushed the challenges. What you're gonna get is complete chance. It'd be like going into work on payday and getting payed the exact same as that ♥♥♥♥♥ Debrah from accounting, you know the ♥♥♥♥♥ who doesn't do any of the work, ♥♥♥♥s around in the break room for hours at a time, yet still gets payed exactly the same. This game reminds me of Debrah. You remember when you were a kid and you wanted your Dad to read you a bedtime story and he was all like ""Not now I just got home from work,""? But you kept pestering him until he agreed and then when he read it it was like ""Mary had a little lamb. The end."" That's what this story is like. In short, I'd rather have a dart frog ejaculate his venomous ♥♥♥ into my ear canal than play anymore of this game.			",24,2,0,1,1,0,0

												I highly reccomend this game just from playing the closed beta! It really feels like Test Drive Unlimited on steriods(which is good, because some of the original TDU devs worked on this game!). You get a good selection of radio channels, including a fantastic classical station, and a full interior view in beautiful detail. The world is obviously not a 1:1 scale of the US, but it is still immense, and you really can't get bored with this game from just driving around. Instead of TDU, where you just drive around Hawaii and look at pretty palm trees, this game has vast deserts, snowy mountains, and sprawling cities. I got to Las Vegas, and I was amazed by how much thought was put into the city's design. It is almost like the devs actually cared about making the game feel as good as possible. As of yet, I cannot speak of the car selection very much, but it seems like it shouldn't be too lousy. If you like open world games, or just want to see the good ol' USA, buy this now!

												The Crew has quickly become my favorite racing game ever. Let me first qualify by saying that I am not a racing sim fan but prefer arcade-style racers. Previous favorites have been Burnout: Paradise and Flatout: Ultimate Carnage. I also enjoy the DIRT and Forza series of games. With that said The Crew has an engaging story with a cinematic feel. I was able to play through the story at a casual pace in about 15 hours. The cut scenes are very well done and really draw you in. Once you finish the story there really isn't much that ties the campaign to the rest of the game however. I hope Ivory Tower (the developer) finds a way to create new missions which allow you to see what Alex and the 5-10s are doing instead of the player just running around the US doing races that don't connect with the story.Other than the disconnect from the story, once you make it to ""V8"" status then the open world really affords you many choices. In addition to the option to go back and re-race any of the campaign missions (to win better car parts) you can also run skill events. You must do wither of these to get better parts for your car(s) before you will have a chance in the PvP section. You can also race in Faction events which earn bucks that you can use to repurchase parts you have already won for cars you haven't yet upgraded or to buy entirely new cars.Speaking of cars, The Crew actually uses licensed cars from a wide variety of car makers including domestic and foriegn. Most of the cars are available to purchase with the bucks you earn in the game but others are only available if you pay real cash. The cost is relatively low and the season pass can make them even more affordable to buy all together. Each car has a variety of ""spec"" ratings from Full-stock, Street, Performance, Dirt, Raid and Circuit. Not all cars support all specs such as a Ferrari wouldn't have Dirt or Raid but many such as the Mustang GT have all so you can get really crazy with your builds. You can also customize the exterior and interior appearance of your rides and with the daily and monthly challenges you are encouraged to enhance your cars to earn more bucks. The variety of car looks and builds is pretty amazing. I rarely see the same configurations more than once when playing PvP.I could go on and on about this game but one of the things I like the most is that the developer, Ivory Tower, keeps enhancing and updating the game to make it better. Recently that added a league rating system and they routinely release new cars, tracks and events. The fact that this game continues to grow really makes it a great value. Unlike my past favorites I am always able to discover new things in this vast vehicular playground. Whether you buy The Crew on sale or at regular price you won't be dissappointed. This is one of the most fun and engaging racing games ever.Oh and did I say that there is a huge expansion coming in the fall: Monster Trucks, Motorcycles and Dragsters!!!!			",92,9,4,11,4,0,4

												Ubisoft is even worse then EA. So, let me explain: The game itself cost 30 bucks, then you must pay 25 more dollars to get the DLC cars, AND THEN (yeah, thats not it) you must pay about 40 more ""greens"" to get another half of the game, with many new cars, game-changing specs of the cars, and many-many things. That half of the game named ""The Wild Run"", which is a DLC, coming pretty soon to the market. So, after some simple calculations we get a FULL game for about 90 bucks! Great job Ubisoft!Now about the game itself. Yes its kinda good, but after you drove a little, completed the story mode, got EVERY car in the game in EVERY spec, drove the whole map, discovered tons of the bugs, like wall-breach and go-underwater bug, some skill races in top-50, you got basically nothing left to do.So the conclusion, should you buy it or not.Well, there is a litteraly a few people, like me, who can truly love it and fall into addiction, who think that the freeroam, huge map and 72 cars is enough (though i never felt like there is so much, and was actually shocked when i got that fact, as the cars feel pretty much similiar). If you want to risk, as its CAN be on of your favourite games, go ahead and buy ""Trial"" version for just 30 USD, and then decide if you ready to pay same to fall into that game for some hours more.

 Поиграв немного... The Crew я увидил игре обширный тюнинг, и большой парк лицензированных автомобилей. Также здесь имеется открытая ""большая карта"" Соединенные Штаты Америки. Истории гонок не было такого окружающее пространство без предзагрузки локаций :) Игра не даст оторваться ни на минуту где можно с друзьями весело и приятно провести время, участвуя в различных видах гонок или сможешь соперничать с различными игроками со всего мира, а можно просто покататься по штатам посмотреть достопримечательности здесь их хватает. Если ты жить не можешь без ежедневной порции драйва, тебя бесплатно перенесут в мир, где царствуют азарт и скорость. Советую поиграть всем!Моя оценка: 10/10 ",214,8,11,11,9,0,22

												Amazing game. Being a huge car lover, and a fan of racing, The Crew is the dream of someone wanting to have a driving game that will keep them entertained. I spent countless hours with a friend of mine just driving and messing around. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes racing games and cars in general. The MMO aspect is well integrated. Major props to the designers.			",141,14,2,13,30,1,18

												I've always been a fan of racing games. Doesn't matter what type or style it entailed. The Crew has its good and its bad. Lets go with the bad first.The only real negatives I can personally give is once you hit level 50 and can get Platinum level cart parts it's a straight crap shoot at getting a level 50 car part. This is my biggest complaint. It's purely random, meaning you might get it on the first try or not get it for fifty tries or more. Also on the car parts that you ""unlock"", which allows you to buy the car part on another car instead of having to Story/Skills missions for the same part is restricted to which car spec you use when you unlocked that car part so if you get it through a Street spec car you can only buy it on a Street spec car, Any other car spec you will have to unlock seperately.The car assists are split into three types, all assist, sport, and hardcore. None of which can be changed for what you want or don't want when driving. This is mildly annoying, but it also knows if you're using a controller or a steering wheel. Avoid using a keyboard if all possible with this game.The NPC cars in Faction missions and the Police are cheaters, to put it as nice as possible, since it doesn't matter what surface they're driving on they will never lose any traction. The Police are lacking in the sense of you can drive by them at ridiculous speeds and run red lights/stop signs and they do not attempt to chase you. The only way to get a police chase is to either run into them or cause enough collateral damage during a Police Watch to trigger them into chasing you. Maybe this can be patched later to make them more like actual cops.The car selection is nice, it isn't on Gran Turismo or Forza level, but it's sufficient. Overall the customization isn't bad either. Visual car aestetics are fairly wide until you get to Raid and Circuit specs (Since they are only color, sticker, tag, and rims options.) Again it isn't at the level of being able to make your own designs and putting them on your car. (I know why, mostly in the sense of people making poorly designed gentailia...) There are enough stickers and color variety to not run into same design, unless everyone in your session is obsessed with The Fast & the Furious.The achievements can be entertaining in their title and down right fun to do depending on the prerequistes.This game isn't for the simulator type player, it plays more to your Test Drive, Need for Speed and Burnout types. Even the adventerer in you will find it fun to be able to drive across the United States finding known landmarks throughout. The story isn't anything new, but it was still fun to watch and have some sort of cinematics and build some level of character developement for the people you add to your crew over the course of your exploits.Oh, make sure you have some friends too, this is far more fun with people you know than driving it alone. At the end of the opening credits it says, ""Never Drive Alone"" and for good reason. Despite the flaws in this game I still see more posistive than negative, but what do I know since I'm the same guy that's been playing APB/APB:R for 3+ years. :)			",80,5,2,13,3,0,7

												THIS GAME IS SO HUGE!the map, not the game's size.Really, this game is awesomely done. Almost all of the cities in US is inside this game (i don't know, i'm not live in US though :/). But really, this game have L.A. Las Vegas, Chicago, Boston, Miami, The snowy mountain, the swamp places, all in real distance between cities. This game is really wow but i don't know why it has a mixed review...Well the cars. it has 70-ish cars in this game (i guess, with dlc) with 5 customs; Street, Dirt, Raid, Performance, and Circuit. But to collect money is a pain in the ♥♥♥ because it's a bit hard collect money and everything to buy new cars and upgrade it. but thank god the game system is something like Leveling thing (like RPG Games). So every car has their own levels. there're challenges in the world (US) and it's repeatable. everytime you finish in Platinum (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum), you get an upgrade for your car.As for gameplay, like i mentioned above, this game is a casual racing game, in a leveling gameplay. it's fun though, you can with 4 of your friends, completing missions together. race in PvP against other crew, or only with your friends. AND. This race. Where the race is point to point, and the race can take up to 2 hours. is like a race from Los Angeles to New York, Las Vegas to Miami, Chicago to San Francisco etc. it's really awesome!The missions in here is a story but it's good story too though you guys should check it out			",123,6,4,3,6,2,1

												I beta tested the game on the PC 2ed beta  for a few hours and it has improved from that. I have just finished getting to level 50 (max) and played through the whole story.The problems with this game are:You have to be connected to the server to playReally??? Is their a time when you wont have the internet and still be able to run this game because most laptops will not run this game and the data rates are low enough.Extreme rubber banding AIThe AI can be pretty easily fixed because it was already fine in the beta so all they have to do is find a balance between the beta and the official game  AI.server issues Well it is only day 2 now so you can expect to see improvements soonMISSING VEHICLES AND SPECS THAT WERE IN THE BETA!I don't even know?! How can you have more cars and specs for them and not put in your official launch game when they were in the BETA! THIS BETTER NOT BE A PLOY TO GET MORE DLC INTO THE GAME! I am hopeful that their were issues with them and they will be adding them in the game (FOR FREE) when the time comes.  Maybe handling issues!?!I say this because I don't think players understand how these vehicles work. Full stock= Slidey Street= Not as slidey and fasterDirt = Slower made for trails/driftyPerformance= Gripey 2ed fastest highway/streetRaid= trucks that raid any where and are slowestCircuit= Grip mobile fastest highway/flat roads with some twistsYou see alot of people only had access to level 10 in the beta witch is only the top 3 specs and they were saying it was like ""driving on ice"" Each car handles different in the different spec and each spec has their own general handling so their is a lot of leeway in how the cars handle, not to mention the small upgrades for the vehicles in game that affect handling. Having played lots of racing games (simulator/arcade) it is defntly more toward the arcade side but it does have a wide range of different types oF driving. These are the most persistent and worst issues of the game but all of it can be fixed through patches and updates, only time will tell if they will attempt to fix these issues.The good?Map beautiful and  huge with fast travel to anywhere you have been NEAR !A good selection of vehicles just not a huge spectrum (needs companies like DMC, Tesla, Hennessy and a few others that are part of American history (THE GAME IS ABOUT AMERICA more American cars please!) ) All kinds of exploring4 player/ multi-player Free content updatesCurrently 48 vehicles with different specs for each (HOPEFUL MORE WITH UPDATES AND NOT DLC AS THEIR IS ALREADY TO MUCH DLC)This game works well with wheels (Has used the logitech driving force gt (was $120 new) for the whole playthrough but I recomend the logitech g27 if you can afford it $200)etc. Those of you that this is more of a money issue i would just wait untill its on sale but if you like mixed racers want to explore with friends or new people and have the pc to run this game well, get it. I enjoy the game for what it is worth and I hope that if you do buy it you enjoy it as well.  $ 85 (game+dlc) is a lot for a title I just hope my purchase and hopes were not misplaced.oh and uplay still sucks and it always will!

												I do like this game but there are still way to many things to fix. Cop AI isn't very bright, but when they are driving on your sides, you're screwed. There is no way out of that the cop cruisers refuse to move, not like a car would act normally.Also the difficulty for some missions is so artificial its angering. Most of the time, your car level needs to be well over the recomemded level because there are always 1-2 cars that just fly ahead of you and stay ahead of you. Also i noticed when a friend of a much higher level helps a much lower, the opposing racers are on par with the high level friend. Wait what?! At this point the lower level is better off on his own. The opposing AI car levels still have a low number but match speed with the high level pretty much throughout the whole race.I know the big map is great and all, but its not 20 miles from Miami to Chicago. At least make it more reasonable.Amidst all this backlash, I still recomend this game. For those who play it like a game not like something of a speed run. Which is what about half of the other people are complaining about.			",30,1,0,2,6,0,0

												The Crew is the 2014 textbook definition of polarizing, even before it released. On the one hand, it is an open-world racing game, giving you the opportunity to drive from one end of the United States to the other. On the other hand, Ubisoft.This polarization extends in-game as well. One minute, I could be screaming at the screen because I failed a raid mission for the fifteenth time: My car had forgotten how it was supposed to work and a tiny rock about two pixels in size sent it careening sideways into fifteen trees like the world's worst lumberjack. The next, I would be driving through the snowy Rockies with the sun shining on my face as I drifted through a corner, pondering whether it was possible to operate the steering wheel with my massive erection.It's a beautiful game with an adequate roster of cars (58 cars including Season Pass, possibly more to come) and wonky physics and I've loved every second of it.

												So after Eurogamer.net gave it a 8/10, I decided to give the game ago with a buddy of mine. Holy crap I did not expact to have this much fun.  First things first, the game is an arcade racer. Don't expect anything along the lines of Gran Turismo et al. The game handles like ye'olde typical arcade game. Honestly, that is a good thing. I have Asetto Corsa to fill the enthusiast needs. It has been quite a while since I've enjode an arcade racer. Actually, the last time I remember having this much fun was with ""Ultim@te Race"".  I am only a few hourse in, so here is why I like the game in a nutshell:1. Pretty/adequate graphics. 2. Runs like butter. Fast 60fps no stutters,,,,nuttin. Considering how bad Unity and Watch Dogs was I am pleasantly surprised. 3. Huge game world , which means while you do the typical race activities, the tracks are diverse and fresh.4. The coop is fun. Just plain fun. 5. The RPG like mechanics keep you going in a ""just on more upgrade"" kinda way. It is fun to see all those players driving around you all the time. Makes the world feel alive. This game is certainly not for everyone, but if you, like me, just want to play an arcade racer with your buddies.....then give it a try....at least when it is on sale.  So far I am not regretting paying full price though.That being said, I did loose connection with the servers once every hour. Which is a minor annoyance.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is very fun and will take away many hours of your life.I don't know if this is just me but I would like every car to behave and cost as much as the car does in real life. For example, the Bentley Conitinental Supersports accelerated from 0-60 in 3.4 seconds in real life, but in the game its only 4 seconds.Also one thing I really dislike is that when there is a 2 part mission, if you start it complete the first part and fail the second part, then exit the mission entireley you cannot restart from the part that you left off.

												Overall it's quite a decent driving game, good fun. Except that collision boxes on NPC vehicles are rather broken...And that the NPCs have to be the stupidest drivers ever, they don't exactly move out of the way (I think theyre fixed on rails until something hits them)...And that you lose connection to the servers a lot...And that there's a bug where you can't see people in your crew when their nametag is right next to you...And that an NPC police car can go faster than a McLaren 12C doing 250mph...But its made by Ubisoft so what did you expect? Oh and also it's a complete rip off on Steam (psst use an external site, you can get it for 6quid *wink*)But to be perfectly honest if you don't mind a few problems here and there it's a decent driving game. Having full customisation on your vehicles is brilliant, earning money is pretty easy, and actually has a pretty decent story line.Graphically it's brilliant, full max settings at 1080p (16x AA etc.) on a gtx1060 6GB it never drops below 60FPS.Gonna give it a 7.5/10, the good parts outweigh the bad, would recommend.

												Haven't beaten the game yet, but so far I really enjoy it. Since I upgraded my CPU to an i5 4690, I no longer stutter and lag which makes it extremely enjoyable. The world is beautiful, the cars are beautiful, the mechanics are, ok, arcade-y or not realistic, but that's ok. If I wanted to play a simulator I'd do that. I really like the huge world aspect, it makes the game much more interesting to explore and drive around on. Only complaints I have are the confusing methods to upgrade and decorate your car. It took me hours to figure out how to simply change the paint on my car, and where to go to get upgrades or visual changes. I also wish I could get much cooler cars sooner, like Ferrari's, Lambo's, etc. For now I'm still stuck with the Nissan for 10 hours, whereas in NFS Rivals I could afford a top of the line car by 10 hours. Anyway, pretty fun game, and I'll probably get the Calling All Units DLC this November!			",36,1,0,0,1,0,0

												I don't usually write reviews, but Ubisoft announced a large expansion for this at e3 today and I want to see them continue that kind of support. My initinal impression: 7/10My current thoughts: 9/10My cousin and I preordered this game and started playing it as soon as it was released. I'll be honest, it's not what I expected at all. I was hoping for another Test Drive Unlimited, so for the first while playing it I didn't like it much. We ended up stopping for three months before picking it up again and now it is one of my favorite games. They've made a lot of changes and fixed a lot of things, but I also like the game for what it is now, not what I wanted it to be. I've spent hours just driving aimlessly to see what I can find, more than half the time I'm not even on a road, I'm using a RAID spec vehicle (think offroad racing truck type of vehicle) to drive where there aren't even roads because the team even put detail into those parts of the map.Speaking of Specs, that's what makes this game so cool. Currently, I am using a 1969 Camaro for all races. I have a version that is basically an offroad buggy meant for driving where there aren't roads, another that is a high-performance circuit racer, a street racing version, a dirt track version, and a NFS-type high-performance street race version. The same car becomes 5 VASTLY different cars, each handling differently and meant for different types of races and terrains. You simply can't drive a Circuit car in a RAID race, that'd be like driving a formula one car in a rally, it just doesn't work. The same is true vice versa. But you can use the same car as both specs if you want.The story mode is pointless, I won't disagree with that, but this game is meant to be an MMO, the story doesn't really matter. It's only there to introduce you to the different specs for PVP events. It is still fun with a crew of course, but pretty boring by yourself. My cousin and I never even finished it. We got as far as unlocking the last SPEC and then focused on PVP events and faction events. PVP events and faction events are what's the most fun. They are races of all types across the US. My favorite race is a RAID race going down the side of a snowy mountain, it's high speed and there are no roads. Faction events can vary in length between less than 10 minutes to over an hour. That seems crazy at first but with a crew it is fun. The entire map is covered with challenges like speed, escape, jump, raceline, etc. to get upgrades for your car like loot drops in an MMO. It's a great way to keep just driving interesting as well. But most of the time you will probably avoid them if you're just driving because really, this game makes just driving feel great.I'm looking forward to what is planned to be added to this game, they said they will support it for a long time and I really hope so. This is the kind of game you can drive for hours without even doing anything and still enjoy yourself, whether or not there is even a road in visible distance of you.			",132,17,7,8,7,1,3

												If you are a fan of cars and racing games definitely pick this up. The handling seems a little arcadey and needs to be adjusted a bit in the settings and of course like all racing games a controller is always nice. But honestly the game will give you hours of fun upgrading your favorite cars, testing you skills in pvp or on solo/crew missions, and roaming around a toned down map of the USA. (with multiple race tracks to find might i add). The only possible downsides is that upgrading the cars can feeling like endless grinding to get the part you want, BUT it really isn't bad, also that the cop chases are pretty sub-par and lastly you need uplay.Closing note about the negative reviews:Most seem to be about the difficulty of the game and how some missions might need multiple people. Honestly all I have to say about the difficulty is git gud :p I had no problem with the game at all (not to mention a little challenge is always fun!)  and in terms of the missions that may need multiple people, there is an option before the mission inviting all people that you can see to help you, so finding multiple people is easy!Please do not let the negative reviews put you off from this game and remember to read them carefully!

												The Crew. A game that I'd followed for a fair few months before its BETA release, and then jumped off the train to ""buyingit-ville"" very shortly before release. For another 8 months I fondled with the idea of buying it, but never did. I didn't really know why... until now.Now, before I start, I should clarify that no, I didn't ""thumbs it up"" by mistake. I bought this game on sale for £12 and I feel it's worth that. But a penny more? No.An open world, multi-purpose racing game with vast amounts of custimization that is also an MMO. Sounds great, right? Let me further clarify those for you.Open World...and then some. Oh boy, the map's huge! I always thought GTA V's map was big, but this must be at least 4x the size of Los Santos. Not only is it big, based around the entirety of the USA and time-consuming to travel across, but it's also incredibly detailed. The sale price was worth it for the gametime on that map alone. Even without missions, it would still be enjoyable for me. You might want to get a plane if you're going from NY to LA though.Multi Purpose Racing/CustomizationYou betcha! Dirt, Raid, Perf(ormance), Street and Circuit specs will make sure that you definitely have the right tool for the job (or the race, in this case)! The car detailing with these specs is very nice. Cars look crisp, although some more than others, for some reason, and there's a lot to do in the customization front (bumpers, fenders etc.).The A.I. however is a joke. It would seem that Ubisoft believe that you should have to hard brake around track corners in a specially circuit-tuned race car that should turn on a dime, only to fall off track and lose your first place position to the guy in last 1 mile back. But, the guy behind you in a Chevy V8, with tyres the size of a standard London road-lane and the turning circle of a cruise ship? Oh, no trouble there! In fact, they don't have to even brake! Their car has high-performance, rubberised glue... apparently. Oh, and if you can actually manage to pull off a first place medal against the sling-shotting A.I., don't expect it to be gold. You're going to need a harrier jet for that. Available in the new DLC , which you'll be able to grab in your nearest showroom for the low, low price of £25.M.M.OHa! Yeah right. I haven't played W.O.W in a few years, but unless their servers have changed to allowing a whopping 8 players in one match(!), then it is an insult to even put this into the same category.ConclusionIt's a fun game. Has a lot of bugs but a lot of them are rarely noticable. It's a great time-waster and the cars look good, especially when you put a big ol' body kit on 'em. Buy it, but don't pay full price for it, even if that is only £25. Also, be prepared for a ton of in-game currency being thrown in your face. Seriously, it's like hitting a wasps nest with a baseball bat; overwhelming and really, really stupid.			",76,12,7,2,10,0,6

I enjoy the story that it has and the replay velue or the free roam part of the game is amazing. I highly recomend this game to anyone that is looking for an online driving game for the price that it's at, however if you do buy it you will relise some parts of the game is not available unless you have the Wild Run DLC.

												I expected better of you, Ubisoft. I'm going to have to give a thumbs down for this game, and I doubt you'll ever see another penny coming out of me for your incompetence for a horrendous buisness practice (in-game cash shop after buying an AAA title game) and trying to force everyone to use your bad game launcher (UPLAY)I bought the game being hyped when everyone saw the amazing CGI Cinematic Trailer The Crew showed off when it was first released on youtube, everyone really thought we were gonna have fun, join together as one with a Crew, with those being huge in the car culture, the trailer really represented us gamers what we really wanted and expected out of The Crew, to no avail tho the game itself was not like the trailer... sadly.The Game was okay at the time, bought the gold edition that included seasons pass and had unlocked most of the sweet cars, seemed like a sweet deal. Despite the fact that the CGI Trailer was no where near close to how the game itself really was, The Crew was overall a game that had more pro's than cons at the time of it's releaseUbisoft then decided to be money hungry, and not only did they change the way how end game worked by reducing the chances of farming rare parts through skills (pushing for people to buy in-game currency and or pvp for them (again low chance), and ADDED a DLC which was not INCLUDED IN A SEASON'S PASS (which I also bought) and the DLC didn't contribute to anything that The Crew was at first, it didn't even make me want to come back to the game, all they did was add a competitive content that had barely ANY interactions between players, a bunch of monster trucks and motocycles that had basically nothing to do with the game as well. Drifting was a nice addition and was probably the only good thing out of the DLC, Drag racing was somewhat of a pointless feature in the game.All in all with current status of this game.The Crew is now in my opinion one of the worst car racing MMOs to date with the recent updates. I have to say.. Good job Ubisoft you finally surpassed EA in being the worst publisher and game developer ever existed in the gaming industry, it's like you ACTUALLY WANTED recognition for it and ♥♥♥♥ people off with your half made games that aren't even complete, even your game launcher is WORSE than Origin. JUST HOW can you not learn from your mistakes?Again, not one penny out of me until I see things improve with you guys.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Half of the review are about they stealing your money, that's right, but who is not? Just look around... The game is short yea, cuz you played the story... Haven't played multiplayer, or with friends, there is 1, 2 hours fraction missions... without stop! NFS WORLD somebody? It's not the same but at least has a feeling like it.  Lot of bad review I don't know why, If it's expensive for you why did you buy it? I want the Season pass and The Wild Run DLC soooo baaad, but i WAIT for the SALE... Blame the game because it's expensive, can't wait for the sale or what? I'm just disapointed in ppl.. Seriously, yea the game doesn't have proper physics, somebody said SIM? Nope... Doesn't have enough JDM and what? I drive then the new Muscle cars, I don't like them much, so what? What's your problem ppl?... Tell me, can't write the steam code in you play, and think they gave you trial version? You gave a bad review because they didn't tell you to write it there? Oh STEAM always does, before you start the game Mr. Gaben loves you.. but you just skip the window cuz why not... Hi there! :)I'm trying to be short as I can!I see NFS ppl! Cry for money maybe you can buy The Crew DLC I played NFS World for a while, really loved that game but EA stopped it (later i'm going to get back to this point). I was really doubtful about the Crew, my bro in law got in on Xbox one, the game was really ugly so I didn't planned to buy the game for a while, checked reviews it got worse I didn't want the game at all. I wanted to play a car game with my friend so we figured out we don't have a big selection. (Open world games) Tell me if I'm wrong. Got NFS 15'' on PC finished the game and it wasn't bad, gave me a little old NFS feeling like  05'MW. Now EA told the players we are getting updates etc. We got 1 medium update and 2 small. Then they told us that's it. I mean c'mon, they could told us , the game is a Demo... -.- New game coming in 17.. I compare The Crew to the NFS, why, because that was an open world sandbox game, yes there is Forza Horizon 2 on Consoles, but not on PC yet. Why is the crew better: Much less loading time, openworld(but it's not a small session), Tuning system(you are able to see the running parts), Cockpit cam, More updates (costs money but they take care of the game, not throwing it away), Whole US map which is pretty big(cruise without any loading time), Fun play tracks, Bikes, Dirt, Peoples on the street (like in MC LA remix), Fun events where you can get a car parts, league system, Fast n Furious sim.  * I'm still playing the game.*Good	  Loading time!  Fun with friends  Fast n Furious sim!  Large map  Small events  Day night weather cycle  Developer active  Different setup cars  Body tuning   Traffic, Peoples on the streets  Crowd scaring mustangs! :D  Show how many miles, kmeters driven. (it's cool i think) Perks,   Police chases   Many real places, racing tracks, GPS  Drag in the desert  Infinite garage space  Mobile garage/tuner  Leagues/rank/Fractions  Montly big challenges/1 2 hour long missions (without stop)  Manual transmission  If you unlock, or buy the part(Rims etc), you going to have it forever. Bad   Visual tuning, bad rice vinyls, expensive  Graphics (I wouldn't say bad but to compare to other games it's not the best, but I love it, low loading time, smooth play  Few glitches, everybody cries about these, have you tried NFS 15? When u are fallig through the map, in the longest race, sometimes you have to stop not fall through and wait for the map load... Yea these glitches are nothing, stop crying!   Physics are bad, Fast n Furious 4ever!   Not enough cars (  missing JDM  and M3 GTR :D) Few small missions are really hard, I mean just unfair sometimes.  DLC's little bit overpriced, have to wait for sale.   Boring music, you can fix it with old NFS tracks! :D   Silent engine sound (maybe fixed in dlc, i don't know yet)  RUF , what's the matter with Porches? I mean the same just sport ed... Lot of people crying about they are going for money with all the DLC's, you know what, I rather pay extra money for extra stuff than, 3 dlc's and the game is thrown away... Fine they are overpriced a little bit, but they are spending time to make it I don't mind, I don't have the Wild Run dlc yet, waiting for summer sale! :)At the beginning I was negative about the game, not it Turned to love, If you  were an old NFS World player I can offer the game for you, it's pretty good, RIP NFS W! Worth to BUY it ON SALE,Overall score 7.5/10 ",186,19,19,16,18,1,7

												Really good game made by Ubisoft I had doubts first but the driving is really good and the Force Feedback on my Wheel (Thrustmaster T500) was well done. I enjoyed the beta and I'm looking forward for the whole game. Driving down highways while blasting good music was big fun and the story seems okay too. Looking good so far.If you like driving games and games where you can tune your car like in the old days of Need For Speed Underground (Visually etc) this is a game to look for.

												I had just finished the story mission. The game is great but not perfect. Graphic is good, map is huge and the sceneries are beautiful. I was quite enjoy the long journey drive, driving across main land of USA. I learnt USA geography from the game.As I mentioned the game is not perfect. What made me drove crazy is the handling. It is really suck! I have upgraded my raid car level to 1100, but I still feel difficult to control the car. The car easily slides to roadside when cornering. The game physics is suck as well. When the car hits the rock, just small rock, the car jump. ~_~# !  I was once noticed the AI opponent drove into river but suddenly appeared in front of my car  few seconds later. Anyway, The Crew, for me is still a good game. I will recommend to my friends. ",49,5,1,4,1,0,1

												I thouroughly enjoyed this game when it was available for the BETA; now I don't.Ubisoft has failed on a majority of its launches this year, this game is not an exception.Off road physics are the worst I have ever seen.Taking out cars is more frustrating than filling out your taxes; the opponent always shoots up to 200 miles an hour when you get within inches of taking them out.The reward system gives bronze for EVERYTHING. All the starting cars are muscle and a Nissan. *Yawn*I picked up the season pass and you can throw a Ferrari into that group. hooray...So far, honestly, the game is not very enjoyable.I do have a few friends to free roam with (the main reason I will keep playing this game) that enjoy it more than I, however, this game was much better during the BETA.

												Overall, the game is fun but it is pretty basic. The story is nothing new but it's nice to have one that isn't crap. The amount of cars is almost embarrasing(at around 35-45) and the ""specs"" don't count as new cars like they want you to think. The sound of the cars are alright but the radio is absolute crap, better off turning it off and making an itunes or youtube playlist of actual good songs. The graphics are alright but pretty bad for how it runs(not too bad for an ubisoft title, if you play far cry 4 on low at 1080p 30fps, you will most likely play on medium at 1080p 25fps in high vegitation, detailed areas, 45 in cities with a good traffic flow, and 60 in bland, emptyish areas).In the end, the story is bland but decent, the cars are good in general, the graphics are disappointing but not as bad as most games(*cough*watchdogs).

												If you liked TDU or TDU2, you'll like this. It's essentially TDU2.5; i.e. flawed, but still the most ambitious open world racing available. It's just plain fun.GOOD. The world alone makes this game easily worth the asking price. The open world is AAA, the best in a racer to date, capturing a lot of diversity and the feeling of cruising in a big open-world. You might expect cities, highways, beaches, snow covered mountains, forrest trails, canyons, and (sadly only a few) in-world racetracks. But you're still likely to be surprised by the diversity here; swamps, dunes, salt flats, etc. The Crew's world is just a fun place to drive.NOTSOMUCH. It's always online, which I might like just to reduce cheating, but requiring always online and not providing dedicated servers seems janky. One poorly connected player can effectively pause a race on and off through the whole race. Running into random players in the world is a core concept that I like, but again, poor implementation means the open world is VERY sparsley populated. I'm hoping they can fix this, but as it is, one of the biggest features in the game feels half-arsed.Handling is on par with the TDU series - a better feel than full on cartoony arcade stuff like Burnout, but still very much (too much) cartoon racing. Also, the story is pretty cliche. But seriously, who cares about that in a racer?Some things fall short of what this team pulled off in the TDU series. The great weather and bouncy baja-esque mountain roads from TDU2 are gone. No motorcycles. The car selection is mediocre at best. And the ability to instantly challenge other players is missing.BOTTOM LINE. I'm still hoping for a talented developer with a serious budget to release a racing world like this with proper handling and a more polished take on seemlessly-integrated multiplayer. Until that happens, I guess this is as good as open world racing gets for now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really like this game, and i see people comparing The Crew with TDU2 (Test Drive Unlimited 2) and these are not compareble because they are very, very different. The Crew is about your crew, its about exploring the world, its about driving your fully tuned circuit spec through the desert at 400+ km/h. Its about the community, beating records, driving together and completing insane faction races. But it is sertainly not without flaws, the AI is either the best driver ever completely ignoring the laws of physics like not needing to brake and drive 300+km/h through a 90 degree corner, or it will drive into every car and object available.Cons and prosCons:- Bad/unpredictable/unreliable AI- Few cars and brands- Bugs causing the game to crash (example: while browsing your collection theres a high chance of crashing)- Uplay (Let us choose between steam or Uplay)- Can be extremely difficult due to AI- And some minor stuff like: no big rewardsPros:- Great handling cars (trucks vs muscle vs sport cars etc feel very different)- Great graphics (though there's a bit too much lensflare sometimes)- Amazing attention to detail, lots of npc's and wildlife- Massive world to explore- Lots of stuff to do when you're not running through the campain- Different types of vehicle specs- Random moments which make you laugh your ♥♥♥ of with your friendsIf i were to rate it i'd give it 8/10.Even though there are bugs and the AI is a bit weird, its a great and fun game to play with your friendsHint: Ubiflop, if you delive anything less than 6+ cars when you release the dlc, i will nuke your ♥♥♥♥.

												So after reading some of the top reviews for this game I want to throw in my 2 cents.IS DIS A SIM RACUR?No, the driving mechanic is very realistic, but it is very much an arcade racer, don't knock it for not being a sim when it's not trying to be.AMURICAN UGLEH MUSCLE CARZZ!!!!!211211!!!!The game is kinda based in America though.DA MAP IS SO TINEY!!!1!It took me over two hours in real life to drive across it, and that was the fastest route I could take, no detours.DA STORYLINE IZ bAD!!!!It's a racing game, has any racing game ever had a decent story?I KANT KUSTUMIZE ME CHARACTRYeah, because you can customize the ♥♥♥♥ out of your carTDU2>CREWLol are you kidding me? And TDU2 had such a GREEEAAAT story. And such a GREEEAT physics engine/handling model. That game was a joke, I'm starting to wonder if people launched that on accident.UBI$OFT MICROTRANSACTIONS HURRRRRREverything you can get from microtransactions is attainable with in game money, obviously DLC cars won't be but almost every game has that even. You can complain about microtransactions all you want, they aren't going away.SURVURS ALWAYZ DOWN!I haven't seen the servers down once and I've been playing since launch day, I also played in the closed beta, never saw it then either.I'm not saying it's a perfect game, I'm saying everyone is expecting a full fledged simulator when The Crew never set out to be that, it's revolutionary in the fact that there are so many different ways to customize your car, street, offroad, etc etc etc. I mean seriously somebody listed no working turn signals as a con, that's so petty. Yeah, the mirrors don't have reflection and some of the shifting animations are fudged, sometimes the character will act like there's a paddle shift and there isn't which leaves him changing gears by swatting the air. As far as I can tell not enough people even use manual transmissions in game to care about shifting animations. Overall this is an incredibly fun game with enough to keep me coming back for a while. I paid full price for it and I don't regret it.EDIT: 12/17I saw the servers go down once a few days ago, they were down for all of 15 minutes. Yeah I was butthurt but it was pretty quick. I'm still enjoying the game but there are a couple more annoyances. PvP is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, everybody has full driving assists on and never even has to think, they go careening off walls and guard rails and beat you by 4+ seconds while you're taking care to not hit anything.The factions are odd, there's 5(I think) factions in the game but only 2 or 3 actually have people. I just so happened to put myself on one of the ones with a significant lack of people and it takes me 20+ minutes to find a PvP match for the faction v faction mode. I honestly don't see why they put so many factions in the game.Uplay's ""drivehub"" is showing me news from 1-15-2015 lolEDIT NUMBER 2 12/17I'm gonna try and stop looking at the other reviews for this game, I just saw somebody complain that it is difficult to get a gold medal on challenges. LOL GIT GUD, THERES ALSO PLATINUM MEDALS IF YOU ACTUALLY WOULD PUT MORE THAN 2 HOURS INTO THE GAME. The challenges are exactly what they should be, CHALLENGING. ♥♥♥♥ing hell, you all want to be spoon fed yet you don't like the idea of microtransactions. Speaking of microtransactions, it's not like I can go buy the best parts right off the bat with real life money, I would first have to earn the part with a car, the spend real life money to put it on a TOTALLY DIFFERENT car. So in essence, I'd be spending my money to make another car just as good as one I actually earned the parts with. Yeah you can buy cars outright with real  money but without parts it doesn't matter. People are just being way too critical of this game because Ubisoft. I bet they turn around and call Far Cry 4 GOTY though...Edit 3 1/9So after getting over 120 hours and not seeing myself stopping I thought I'd throw out another update.I've seen the servers down here and there, they're fixed within 20 minutes though.I have one friend who everytime we try to crew up, it doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing work, so we have his brother get on and crew us up. (Until they patched that a couple days ago)Ubi announced they're going to fix mirror reflections, I hope you're all happy.First DLC coming out in a week, they'll be keeping that pace for about a year, supposedly.They're also fixing the biggest gripe, the AI chase catchup whatever you want to call it, it's getting patched next week, so basically every review for this game becomes null and void. >Everyone's face when Ubi is listening and patching ♥♥♥♥			",79,12,4,4,14,2,7

												This Game is pretty amazing. A racing game with a pretty decent story. The customization of the cars is fairly profound and fun. Its massive amounts of fun to plaly with friends. The only real issue i have is the cops. They are a little OP. You could have a Corvette maxed out, and they can keep up, and even go faster in generic Sedans. Its not a massive problem but it is annoying. Graphics are great, the driving is realistic but not simulator like. I would recomend this to anyone who loves racing with friends.			",110,10,0,8,5,0,5

												Typical Ubisoft game.Horrendous UI.UBI server issues, I just played 2 days and I already know 4 different connectivity issue codes.Cheating AI for both Cops and Contenders.It is more playable than TDU at this time but barely.Still, the game is fun with friends, but 50€ for that, haha, no.

												Don't buy it if you doubt Ubisoft. I have been struggling for a week to get Uplay to work, even just on its own and I still haven't found a solution.

												BEFORE I STARTED PLAYING THIS HOW WAS MY FEELING OF THE GAMEim not into car games (maybe cause i suck at them), but had to try the new ""mmo star"" from ubisoft (i dont like ubisoft much as company when it comes to multiplayer and patching, seems like the just fish after wallet money and move to next projekt.) But had to try this oneWHEN I TRIED IT HOW CAN IT BE COMPARED TO THE HYPE I HAD:i had a OK feel, i knew at once i will grow tired of doing the repetetive missions and boring main story. its a game i log into and feel i play alone, like need for speed. I really wanted to like it .TOP 3 I LIKE1. graphics are stunningly beutiful 2. good driving mechanics and lot of stuff to do3. learning curve is easyTOP 3 I DONT LIKE1. repetetive 2. world feels so lonely3. felt the story where very dull.. So overall points by me given are 1/10 where 10 is max.Multiplayer experience: 1/10 (played with a friend in party and not good, also PVP endgame is worthless with ques for 15 min for a round where the best car wins..)Graphics: 10/10Developer update game: 5/10 Developer informing us about their team and state of game: 5/10 IS THE GAME WORTH IT?i have to say NO on this one, since you have to pay a steep price for this ""single player"" game and yet there are micro transactions in it... ohh godits very repetetive and will be forgotten by me fast..

 Easily the best racing game I've ever played Popular criticisms include; ""handling too much for an arcade game"" Because it's not an arcade game""wheelspin is too much"" because you're using a 250 horsepower shot of nitrous in a car with a 10:3 power-to-weight ratioUnfortunately because Ubisoft has listened to what they're hearing (ie; game hate faries on the forums) the AI has been brought down to a minimum.Game has a huge map, probably the biggest of any open world game so far, the car handling is amazing, physics are pretty much bang-on, the in-game community is great, the car customization could use some work but it's a very small kink in an otherwise well-oiled machine. As a veteran racing-game enthusiast (weird guy that 100%s gran turismo games) it took me almost 20 hours to get through the story mode watching every cutscene, the story is even good although somewhat generic, it's well done. If you're an open-world racing game fan this game will probably give you a weird feeling, traditionally we saw games where you could see it, but not necessarily go to it. With this that simply isn't the case, if you can see it in The Crew, you can almost always go there. 6 levels of customization put the game's huge map to use, they are fullstock, street, dirt, Perf (performance), raid (trophy trucks), and circuit (full-blown race cars) each with it's own merits and downfalls that add an unmatched level of diversity to the game.The options menu is even pretty comprehensive with toggles for anti-aliasing, even types of anti-aliasing. individual performance impactors with their own toggles, and full wheel support with multiple ways of customizing so you can tune it to your driving style. All in all a fantastic game, even after the career mode there's plenty to do and fun to be had. 9/10			",11,0,0,2,4,0,0

												I would like to start off with the biggest reason I even recommend this game is because it is the closest thing we PC gamers have to Midnight Club L.A.I love and hate this game! What is does right, it does right! What is does wrong, it really does it wrong!I will only list the things wrong and missing in the game. It has everything else in my opinion!1. This is possibly the biggest one for me and I don’t really know why! The side and rearview mirrors don’t work! WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY THINKING! Almost every racing game has working mirrors!Racing games on mobile, last gen systems even the PS2 AND PS1 racing games had working mirrors!This seriously needs to be fixed!2. Not enough races or race types! There are plenty of street challenges… -_-There are so few races that I forget I’m playing a RACING GAME sometimes!3. Damage on cars are overdone in some places and underdone in others!If I hit a leaf, my whole front end looks like I hit a tree at 200mph! But glass wont break or even crack even if I roll my car! This just seems lazy!4. Textures look good on your cars and most of the environments. It’s not what you would expect from a next gen graphics game, but they look good. And with the size and scope of the game I would think they look amazing! Where is the bad? EVERY SINGLE PEDESTRIAN CAR AND THE PEDESTRIANS WALKING DOWN THE STREET! I have seen better textures on the PS2! I swear I am not exaggerating! They look horrible!!!I can’t even begin to figure out why they thought this was OK!5. Now on to the little things. No neon lights. Why is this a big deal? It is and isn’t. I like neon’s, what can I say? But in a game that is supposed to be an MMO, you need to have more customization!6. No window tints.7. Very limited on body parts.8. The game has a lot of rims to choose from, but 90% of them all look the same!9. Cant paint parts different colors.10. The performance parts system is kind of wack! Look it up on YouTube.11. Not a lot of cars to choose from. But at least they had my Skyline!12. Its structured as a F2P type game. Now that wouldn’t be such a problem if it weren’t for the fact that they are selling it for $60. Plus I have played some F2P racing games that felt more complete than this game that had WORKING MIRRORS! (Sorry, but I’m not going to ever let that go till they fix it).At any rate, the game is fun, not worth what I paid, but fun.Buy it on a sale, a BIG sale! Anything over $20 is way too much! But if you really want to play a game that kind of reminds you of Midnight Club L.A. then this is the game for you….Kind of.. -_-So yes I recommend it, even though is sucks! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastic game. Each spec you unlock changes how you play, and upgrading your vehicle is rewarding and challenging. Community events, plans for additional vehicles and features, and a strong fanbase/developer relationship means that The Crew has a bright future. The only downside is that a constant internet connection is required to play due to the MMO aspect, but considering no one seems to complain about World of Warcraft needing a constant network connection to play, I find it difficult to justify that complaint. If you're looking for a racing game that goes beyond what any Need for Speed title, especially the soon to be discontinued Need for Speed World, The Crew is just what you're looking for.

												This game is amazing: despite the Ubisoft logo.The map is 3x larger than GTAV, me and a friend measured Seattle to the Miami Keys and it's roughly 98.9 miles.Other than that, flawless launch from Ivory Tower, very good optimization for a game designed for high end pc's.It runs fine on my 750 Ti SC. My favorite parts is Death Valley, the Black Hills, even though I've only discovered only 6% of the map. I can't praise Ubisoft and Ivory Tower enough for The Crew. It is a huge check mark in the positive coloum for PC gaming. It's far from them earning their reputation back, but it's a very good start. Glitches and bugs are expected since this game is brand new.WIth nice little easter eggs and salutes to past racing game legends like Need For Speed World, Hot Pursuit 2010, Burnout Paradise, Shift 2 Unleashed, Test Drive Unlimited 1 & 2 and many more, The Crew is a hotbed of MMO racing that just feels right. How many other games out there can you tune a Ford GT to 700hp, and wreck a Koenigsegg Agera R? I can't think of many.Another huge check mark is the fact that the devs actually watch the forums; someone suggested that a free roam cam be added, like the one in NFS World, and within 12 hours someone from Ubisoft responded saying that something like that is in the works...Now that's rare now a days.

Catchup, a game mechanic designed to keep allplayers and AI in a close proximity so one person doesn't have the lead the entire race.

												I never really got into the story of this game but it seemed really cool. The graphics are nice and the cars are cool and there are lots of customization option which is always nice. The fact that their are cities that look just like real life is awesome! I would recommend this game to someone who likes racing games or even driving becuase I could cruise around this awesome map for hours. So this is Ubisoft meaning it could be a pretty big price tag. This game is often not on sale so it is expensive but it is worth it. So I would rate this game a 8.9/10			",118,31,6,9,39,3,11

												So, I don't get the negative response. Sure, right after the release - when I got it - the game didn't feel finished in any way. I myself was a bit disapointed, but still played on. The reason I got the game was because of the HUGE map, which was in pretty good shape at the time. The cars didn't feel too realistic and I didn't feel the ""feeling"" I was expecting. But still, I plaed it, because I just bought it and wanted to try it out. I then stopped playing it for a couple of months as I had other things to do. Then a while back I started playing it again. The feeling was completley different. The cars were updated from the last time I played, and countless bugfixes had been fixed. I played it with my brother and had really fun! (Except the graphics I have on it as my computer is pretty bad xD) So would I recomend this game? Well, it depends. If you can relate to all of the following you should pick it up, and you will have a great time. So:-If you have friends that play it-If you like car games, but your not looking for a super realistic simulator-If you want a HUGE open world to explore So the first point is really important. If you have friends to play with. If you don't, it will get boring after a while. You basicly just sit there driving arround. This is after all a game made for multiplayer. Although the ""story mode"" which is still in the online world was better than I expected.So overall should you buy this? Well if you have friends that play it, yes, of you don't well it's still wuite fun as you can still find people online to talk with, but it is not as fun as cruising arround with your frineds. If your unsure I sugests that you pick it up during a Steam sale of any sort. At the monent while typing this, there is a 50% discount due to the steam summer sale.I hope this helped you, and I would recomend this game. (Maybe due to my 88 hours playtime xD)			",50,0,2,0,8,0,0

 The Crew Review  This review will contain some stuff i love, like, dislike and hate about The CrewPrepare yourself--- Things I LOVE - The MapThe best map I have EVER seen in a racing game, and not the biggest, but the most diverse map I have EVER played on. It's that good. It would take a large amount of hours to completely explore the map. I still haven't completely expored it in my many hour playtime. It takes about an hour (if you are going very fast) tho get from one side of the map to the other. It just such a fun map to drive around, to take a road trip, and to see all kinds of fabulous landmarks throughput your journeys.-Everything about the carsAll the cars have lots of detal, interior and exterior. They are all different to drive, and unique in their own ways. Also, all the sounds for the cars are the legit real life sounds, recorded from the cars in a sound studion. SO nice.--- Things I like -Customization of carThe customization is quite good, especially compared to most of the recent need for speed games. The only problem is the customizations seem too concrete, there is no ability to add your own imagination or personal touch. Some stickers have different colors, but you can't change the color of a specific sticker. Also, each sticker goes on a certain, unchangable place on the car. You can make your car different than others, because there a large number of aesthetic parts and stickers.-Car specsI really like how the car can utilize many different utilities by changing the spec. There are 5 specs: Street, Dirt, Performance, Raid, and Circuit. They are all fun to experiment with. Some are great for the racetrack, while others are great for offroad trails. My only gripe about specs is that very few cars have the full 5 specs, most have 1-3 of the the specs. The starter cars all have the full 5 specs, so you will be able to have them all in at least one car.-The storyIt is surprising for a good story to be in a racing game, but in this case that surprise came true. It may seem cheesy and cliche to some people, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. -The graphicsThey aren't amazing by any means, but they are good. They capture american geography well (with a few minor hiccups) but there are many current racing games that have better graphics. They are definitely not bad though, they still make the game nice looking. The best graphics in the game are seen in some of the cutscenes. Legitimate movie quality cutscences.--- Things i dont like -The ""mmo"" aspect of the gameOnly 8 players in your session, and they players continually switch to different players, so, yeah, no. I still don't really know how to play with my friends, because there is no server choice, just places you in one.-Not that many carsThere really should be more.-Anything that has to do with AIOther racers, cops, even NPC traffic. All equally annoying.-Customization of your characterNonexistent. Hopefully you are okay with the way you look, cuz you can't change that.--- Things I HATE -ubisoft-uplay-ubisoft support-uplay servers-ubisoft bugs-uplay bugs-ubisoft glitches-uplay glitches-ubisoft in general-uplay in generalFortunately, ubisoft only published this game not developed, so it isn't UNPLAYABLE (i.e. ACU) a good company called Ivory Tower made it, which was responsible for some other open world maps (i.e. GTA 4) Some things about the game just seem buggy and unfinished, not because of Ivory Tower, but because of ubisoft. It just seems like with the many delays the game should be PERFECT but it isn't.And now, for the thing I HATE the most about the crew, the following is a reddit rant that i put onto /r/The_Crew/ :Originally posted by author of this review: There is one thing that i just can't get past about this game: THE MIRRORS DON'T WORK! I mean SERIOUSLY!!!!! WHY?!?!??! test drive unlimted from THE 80'S has working mirrors.
http:// http://i.ytimg.com/vi/xSvpmi79ZXY/0.jpg  <---FREAKING 8 BIT MIRRORS! and the crew doesn't. GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH
3 reasons why the crew doesn't have mirrors
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...
Don't get me wrong I love the game but.....I JUST CAN'T GET PAST THAT

Ok thanks for reading all that. I'm done now. The good conclusion:The game's main feature, a big map, is DEFINITELY true. The map, the cars, the graphics, all together make the game an great, interesting, and fun experience.The bad conclusion:The online, which was the other big feature, fails to deliver. There are many online problems and bugs that make some give up on the game. But I am not a quitter. My Rating:  8/10 Final conclusion (tl;dr) :This game offers an amazing experience, one that I have never seen in any other game. Simply being able to take a trip down a desert highway, explore a mountain, race around a city, and explore the entirety of the United states is something that no other game has ever done so beautifully.Overall great game, beautiful map, beautiful cars, just some problems that need addressing. My rating is subject to go up if those improvements are made. The crew is definitely my favorite driving game, and it will never get old or boring. With a map the size of the U.S., how could it? Happy driving!  ",91,25,9,5,42,1,10

												It's an assertion that doesn't make any sense! Ubisoft has sold The Crew as a racing game, and there are certainly plenty of parts where you drive your car really fast.

												Easy game to recommend. Loads of fun. Yes...I have a Nvidia card and had to rollback the drivers but not that hard to do to enjoy the game. Not a reason not to recommend the game.The game play is fun and a great open world. I had the difficult time of sitting down and trying to figure out which  game I would play more Crew, Project Cars, or Assetto. I choose Crew and not to say anything about the others...because I don't have them, but I am enjoying this and getting some decent game time in.This reminds me of Driver and I think the graphics are pretty damn good, now this isn't a true racing sim, which is good for me (IE, I suck at those).

												Easy game to recommend. Loads of fun. Yes...I have a Nvidia card and had to rollback the drivers but not that hard to do to enjoy the game. Not a reason not to recommend the game.The game play is fun and a great open world. I had the difficult time of sitting down and trying to figure out which  game I would play more Crew, Project Cars, or Assetto. I choose Crew and not to say anything about the others...because I don't have them, but I am enjoying this and getting some decent game time in.This reminds me of Driver and I think the graphics are pretty damn good, now this isn't a true racing sim, which is good for me (IE, I suck at those).  I find moving from one course to the next to the next, repetitive and stale in a racing game. The open map, side challenges, plenty of cars to choose from, motorcycles, monster trucks.... a good variety that allows one to find different things to do and not get bored.

												It's an assertion that doesn't make any sense! Ubisoft has sold The Crew as a racing game, and there are certainly plenty of parts where you drive your car really fast. Hell, there's a race in this game that's four hours long (more on that later).The Crew  isn't a racing game though. Not really. I have no doubt it was pitched as a racing game, and I know why it's being sold as a racing game, and it's because a racing game is something people can understand. It's the same reason Assassin's Creed needs some ridiculous science fiction frame story—because in 2007 the idea of an action game set during the Third Crusade wasn't ""viable."" ",28,1,2,1,3,0,2

												Before wild run, it was a really good game. It has a huge map, a very large selection of cars, and multiplayer, the career, and faction missions were fun. Now the game is unplayable due to Ubisoft's negligence to fix the game-breaking map rendering glitch. It's been there for 6 months, and whenever I play the game I encounter it and have to restart. It not only makes freedrive, career, and faction missions unplayable, but causes multiplayer to black screen until the person with the glitch leaves.

												I really looked forward to this game because the idea behind this is very appealing. But unfortunately Ubisoft didn't do a great job of implementing.Positive things about this game, the map is huge and there is so much room for playing so that's certainly a good thing. The graphics are ok, but that is not something that bothers me too much. The idea to form a crew is also a good thing, but is poorly implemented and there are so much things to do with it to make it better, but they didn't. Faction races are great, but could be a lot better. For instance, make a race with a destination point and you can choose with route to take. The physics are not great, but not bad either. Only thing the cars should do is drift, instead of constant understeer.So yeah, there are a lot of things that could be done better and it really dissapoints. This game had a massive potential to become something great, but it didn't take that chance. Maybe The Crew 2 will be better, if that game will ever arrive of course. Not something you should buy i say, unless you really really want to.			",36,3,8,4,2,1,0

Hidden Cars)+ Controller compatable and rebindable keys.+ Fun challenges.+Picture mode with some editing tools to make your photo look nice.Cons:- You have to grind to level up your cars.- A lot of the cars are DLC- Only OnlineAll in all, the pros outweigh the cons, in my opinion.

												Great game, storyline is solid. But you can't ""customize"" your car, you can only add packages, i.e. street package, performance package, with some flexibility otherwise. Graphics aren't the greatest, but gameplay is more important. Well, offline gameplay is, considering the community is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. What people like to do is form little posses of 3 or 4 cars, then find solo players just cruisin' around and run them off the road to the point where online gameplay is literally intolerable, since you can't drive anywhere. On top of that, grandma's Nissan has the same physics as a Dodge Ram 1500, so theres no way to defend yourself. To add insult to injury, I bought the ""game of the year"" edition, or whatever they're calling it now. So thats just 85 bucks down the drain.If I still haven't turned you off yet, I'd like to mention that you need UPlay to run this game. What's UPlay? It's like Steam, for Ubisoft. UPlay and Steam hate each other. It's nearly impossable to get in a game with people from your friends list because it's so hard to get Steam and UPlay to work together.Still need more? Recently there was an update for The Crew that added a new feature called ""Wild Run"". Wild Run is 25 dollars, regardless of whether you bought the season pass. What? I just paid 85 dollars for your game and I still don't have everything? Now, Wild Run includes a feature for the player to do races with other players, which was availible as a part of base game. Was. Now, unless you pay Ubisoft even MORE money, you can no longer play with other people, which was the original intent of the game; multiplayer co-op racing. Ubisoft just decided that it was a good idea to completely disable the most vital part of the game in favor of petty amounts of profit.Ubisoft recently released a new DLC for police chases called ""Calling all Units"" which I was really psyched for. Turns out, just like Wild Run, even though I have a season passI still need to pay EVEN MORE for this content. The Crew, plus the season pass, plus Wild Run, plus Calling all Units equals well over 120 dollars. Honestly Ubisoft, when does the money hoarding end?Screw you, Ubisoft. I'd give anything to get my hands on one of your devs right now.			",45,5,4,4,3,0,0

												While the story is somewhat entertaining, the gameplay is really quite boring. There's literally nothing to do but race around, and while it is a racing game, the trailers hinted at other forms of gameplay and much more exciting cinematics. It's not a bad game, but its not a good game either. The story is pretty minimal compared to most games, and trying to tie this story into a continually running server-based platform makes for some really annoying drive times.Also we were promised the whole country, as though that would be to scale. Nope. Everything has been scaled down so that most of the cities are a third of their actual sizes. I threw down a lot of money for this game because I thought I would be getting a lot out of it. Really, because of the setup we actually got, I say this game is worth no more than $30. If the animations and the LOD look right up your alley, you might be inspired to pay $40. But never is it ever worth the full AAA studio pricing.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So now that we have Wild Run, I guess the only thing I can say is WHY didn't I get it with my season pass? Considering it adds modes like DRAG racing, DRIFTING, etc. that most racing games have from the start, I think it should have been a free update. I won't be wasting my money on Wild Run though. The gameplay as a whole is still really boring.			",60,16,3,4,13,0,6

												I can't be more honest than that.The game is cool, Actually, Its pretty amazing.Tho i got some thing to say about it.First, I will start with the PROS i guess.SO THE PROS:-The world is huge. You can drive for hours. (I literaly finished a race with a 104 minute record.)-Theres a weather system, Also day and night. Which really affects the gameplay.-TONS OF CARS.-The game not stands for full singleplayer, You can make a crew (A some sort of group that will join your missions.) -Pvp (NOT ONLY RACING, Theres a lot of multiplayer pvp mods !)-Upgrading and modding your car... Oh man.. This part. You just need to see the customization. (Ps. Made me poop myself when first saw).-You can have a driving test before getting a new car-Theres Voice chat and a regular chat. (Also whisper, crew chat and etc)-Theres a lot more honestly just. idk less important for this review (You should also taste by yourself you know.)So ofcousre after Pros. I should hit with the Cons !-The biggest con by my opinion. Is the crashing system.Crashing into cards happends a lot (Even if you are not bad like me.) Lets say you gotta race inside the city and theres a turn left or right doesnt matter. Sometime, Because its a city after all, Theres cars waiting for that green light. Yea, In that moments youll find cars all over the road except to the right direction.I find it really annoying. Playing Perf spec (I guess the most fast cars in the game) On a road which is not straight inside the city totally can caus your death. (I did played a mission like that, i wanted to punch my screen, AND I CONSIDER MYSELF A CALMED PERSON.)[Woah thats a big con]^-When you buy a car, No refunds. You cant really regret it. Same with specs.-When theres a chat notification you dont really get it, You need to open the chat box, unless you make it visible the whole time, Which kinda disturbs.I must say, By my opinion once again, There is not a lot of cons to the game. Just really basic things. Handling isnt even bad. (Just on peft spec cars. Well thats because its ♥♥♥♥ing hard.) But yet the game extremely fun, and enjoyable.I really hope you enjoyed my review. Make sure to like it if it helped you so other can see it aswell. *SORRY FOR BAD ENGLISHHHHH*Peace and love sugars. ",35,2,0,4,5,0,3

												This is a fun game for what it is. It is by no strecth of the imagination what the developers told us it was going to be and unless you feel ok with mucking around with router settings the ""never drive alone"" tag-line will be a confident slap in the face. But it is still a fun arcade racer that looks good and offers some really nice open world play with a lot of things to do from jumps and slaoms to classic exploring. Also once you get it to work PvP multi-player is fun and frantic. Same with the co-op part of the game. It is far from perfect but it is still one really good ride.That being said... It has some very shifty multiplayer and use som peer2peer solution limiting how many players you can run at the same time. It also have DLC and pay-only cars out the tailpipe.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Cities feel familiar and the modelling is excellent. Mini challenges always keep it fun. Story line is great, much better than NFS franchise (another EA horse beaten dead). The PVP lobby system not that good. My cars went from 200 through 800 during the story game and get matched up with 1200 cars. No point in racing even. Guess the lower levels are playing the story game.Driving is excellent and feels good handling. There quite a few neat tricks to learn. The different kind of cars drive great (street, dirt, perf, raid) and you get to upgrade the visuals to get amazing cars.I'll keep coming back to get a few 1200 rides and kick some PVP ♥♥♥.

In my opinion, it's the closest we have to a modern Burnout right now.For those with kids, I let my 5 year old drive around the countryside all the time. It's easy to ignore the main plotline and just explore. He loves it.			",238,52,8,67,21,2,25

												I recently added the The Crew Gold Edition to my library. So far, I really like the game.The graphics are great. Very well done.I'm still getting used to driving the cars, but I will eventually.The game does require a Uplay Account, and the Uplay Client.Please refer to this game's details for information regarding those terms.

												I bought this game because it was developed by the same team behind Test Drive Unlimited, TDU and TDU2 weren't top notch games in terms of handling, but they had this ""charm"", I found TDU2 so relaxing, I played it for hours and it was really fun just driving around the islands, it had its big flaws like the ridiculous handling but somehow it was fun. I expected the same calm and relaxing mood from The Crew, sadly one of its biggest selling point was their worst feature IMO, the change to RPG style ruined the game, the idea was good but the IA of your opponents is completely crap, to the point that the game wasn't fun to me at all but frustrating, I really wanted to continue playing this game but I just couldn't, I don't have the time I had a few years ago and the fun isn't there anymore, that's why I cannot recommend this game to anyone, it's not a simulator and  it's too arcade that it's not fun either, please note that I played this game with a Logitech G27 wheel, that made it worst because the game is intended to be played with gamepad for its ridiculous handling, TDU was playable but The Crew is not, and you can't progress through the missions if you don't level up, so you will find yourself wasting time on repetitive side missions in order to play the story missions.I hope that in the future there will be another Test Drive Unlimited, with the same idea but improved, if I wanted to enjoy 20 minutes driving trhough the beautiful Hawaii and Ibiza, without feeling pressure to level up or completing frustrating missions TDU was the one, maybe I'm wrong because I thought The Crew was going to be that game, and the team had a completely different idea of the game, but this wasn't the game I expected.

												30 hours in and I still have much to do. The world is so damn big and traveling from point A to point B is not boring at all since the world is full of different challenges for fast and agile cars. Upon completing these challenges, you earn parts for your car. If you don't need the parts, you can send it to your garage which will allow you to build up another car in the future.Story missions have you racing against time, destroying crates of supplies, catching up to an NPC and making them crash, and more.This game has car builds for dirt, street, drift, raid, and circuit racing. I probably forgot one, but that list should show you that this game is the whole package.Jumping online with friends is as easy as meeting up at a certain location and grouping up. Most of the campaign can be completed with a friend.Warning about DLC:""Wild Run"" is a DLC pack. You do not need it to enjoy this game, but you will occasionally run into cars and missions unavailable, but don't worry about it. I've been doing just fine without it, but I will pick it up on a sale because I definitely want this game to last even longer. ",400,56,12,49,14,5,26

												If you looking for an arcade style racing game you better play this than any of the NFS games after Underground 1-2/Carbon/Pro Street.*Huge world with thousands of places to visit. Never race the same track again.*Open gameplay. Play the story, PVP, global tournament series, challanges, faction wars or just go and start chasing random people in the world. You chose to go single player, multiplayer or both. All in the same game.*Many different car types plus bikes all with specific race types and different strenghts/weaknesses (street, race, drift, drag, dirt, monster truck, etc)*customisation (not as in-depth as NFS UG 1-2 but still a nice addition)If you still not sure because of the mixed reviews wait for a sale and in worst case you can get a refund, but trust me in less than two hours it will suck you in.

												The Crew is a great game. simple as that, but it defineitely has areas that should be improved but first let me start with the positives.It is easy to progress through the game, provides a challenge, has a huge map to travel around, encourages open world driving by including street and dirt vehicles, beautiful landscape and monuments to visit, controller support (including steering wheel) and the endgame makes you feel like a god but, there are some flaws.cons:1. traffic- although this is pretty fun to dodge around in free roam, it can be really frustrating when you're trying to beat a mission where one mistake can ruin everything but it adds a challenge. The worst part is when you crash there is a cutscene that plays and will ruin your time even though you can skip it and also there are road block made by the AI because they crashed into the car themselves.(hopefully that made sense)2. Physics- This games physics are terrible most people can easily look up an example of this but for the sake of this review, i would list some for you. Some are: crashing into a wall and being sent into the air, hitting a little sidewalk will make you do a wheelie or crashing into a vehicle will push it aside instead of a collision.3. Short storyline- TBH this doesnt bother me as much as it does for other people. If youre looking for a racing game then this is a racing game. overall the story is pretty boring and short.4. The DLC- another thing that bothers other people, this game kinda forces you into the DLC but personally i bought the complete edition which saves a lot of money in the long run if you plan on buying this game because it comes with a lot of cars and the season pass (At this the the calling all units is coming out soon)(Side note) progression is too quick?- I dont know about anybody else but i beat the main storyline and hit the level cap pretty quickly within maybe 4 days of playing. This didnt bother me because i wanted the endgame cars that are fast. Also within a week of casually playing, i already maxed out a couple of cars and a motorcycle dont know if its just me or not but if you buy this game you will find out.5. glitches- This one kinda goes along with physics but while playing, there will sometimes be invisible bumbs in the road and when you crash on the wall occasionally you will get stuck in it or you will be on top of it and will probably have to reset to fix it.6. Online- This game requires you to be connected to the internet at all times not much to say here but its extremely easy to play with friends at least.Even with all these things i still would recommend this game especially if its on sale (I got it during the steam summer sale) Not going to lie this game needs some tweaks and shows a lot of potential. Perhaps future DLC will provide an even bigger map (although i doubt as that will take a lot of resources and time) In the end, if you are looking for a fun arcade racing game this is your go to choice, you can race solo or with friends and overall have a great time. although i said the physics need to be updated, it still makes this game enjoyable for messing around. I hope that if you reading this that you buy the game and expand this community.			",58,7,1,12,4,0,2

												The Crew tries to be a driving game with something for everyone. You can team up with a group of friends for an epic road trip filled with fast-paced illegal activities, and seamlessly explore a massive map of the U.S., from the tip of Maine, all the way down to Miami, over to Los Angeles and back again, passing through other iconic cities along the way. Though it's true that all of this is possible, the experience isn't all that it's made out to be. The Crew tries to do a lot, and while it technically delivers the features it promises, it frequently stumbles over itself. There are brief moments of joy within, but just when you start to think the game's turned a corner, a bump in the road sends your joyride careening off course. When the best thing a racing game has going for it is the variety of environments it has to offer, you know something's amiss.You start off in the streets of Detroit, but it's not long before you're rolling through mountains, everglades, and forests. The huge maps and its colossal number of activities is intimidating at first, but that's great: the more places to go and things to do, the merrier. Story missions, which take you through a trope-filled campaign that plays out like a Fast & Furious sequel, send you from one region of the country to the next, and missions emerge out of the blue along the way. You street race, smuggle contraband, take down competing criminals, and tackle bite-sized emergent challenges that test your abilities behind the wheel while you're on the go. There are hundreds of things to do, but only some are truly fun. The problem? With so much ground to cover, The Crew feels and looks like it's stretched too thin, and it's evident from the start. The Crew's world may be massive and varied, but it's not good-looking. It's constantly plagued by texture and geometry pop-in, and looks generally outdated. People, buildings, the environment, and most importantly, the cars, are represented by disappointing models that suffer from an unsightly amount of aliasing.Keep in mind that if UPlay, PSN, or Xbox Live is down, you can't play The Crew, even if you just want to go solo. During my time with the game, I was booted due to server or connection issues on a daily basis, which was very frustrating. The most enjoyment you get out of the game's connected world comes from player-vs-player competitions, but even they have issues.			",31,3,1,2,1,0,1

Are you looking for a Next Gen racing experience? Go look somewhere else.UPDATE: 01/11/15After nearly 3 months after launch there were only 2 patches correcting minor stuff but not a single commitment from Ubisoft on addressing wanted features in the game. The Steam user satisfaction dropped its recommendation from 96% to 77% and it will continue to go down as more people figure out how little this game offers after 20 hours - which is a ridiculous little time for a MMO. --- CONTINUE TO STAY AWAY.I've pre-ordered The Crew Gold +Season Pass expecting that all publishing on hard working to bring a new concept of game would be delivered. After my first 8 hours with the game I'm never ever buying Ubisoft games at launch anymore (As I'm already doing with Assassin's Creed franchise since Brotherhood).The game isn't an evolution from what we've seen on the Beta phase, it is just a ""stability"" upgrade in all aspects. To be honest, the only thing I've seen implemented from what was asked on forums during closed and open betas was the ability to change the gear faster while on manual shift, almost everything requested by the community was ignored.To review the game I've used a Nvidia GTX-780 + i7-4770K overclocked, my personal impressions below:- Are you ready for Ubisoft concept of MMO? It was confirmed by Ubi Community Manager that the ""bug of few people per map"" is in fact working as designed since they believe 8 player per map is OK.For a game where the selling point is ""Massive open world"" this is a flaw. - Don't expect to be able to play multiplayer, cause it isn't working as it should. It took me about 50 tries to be able to do 1 single coop mission since the message ""There is no one in your session"" was constantly been displayed even while I could see about 10 players on the map screen. - Do you like driving from cockpit and using the rear mirrors? Hopefully not cause they we're NOT implemented at all you will see is a gray piece of junk that since it isn't showing your rear shouldn't even be there. Surprisinly and adding ""more fun"" to the randomness of this issue, when you put your view in 3rd person mode (behind the car)... TA DA! The mirrors magically start working! W-T-F!!!Lets pause for a little reflection:  Since 1987 we have working rear mirrors thanks to Test Drive 1 but not in this advanced ""next gen"" title? There is no other racing series considering doing the same crap.- Anti-Alising is so horribly implemented that even downsampling from 4K resolution to 1080p you will notice the jadded edges everywhere. Specially when you're wandering inside cities hopefully you will not bother on blinking edges in general scenario elements like fences and light lamps, buildings and cars as you will be near to have a convulsion. Surprisinly AAs seems to had worked a lot better with ""wild nature"" elements so trees and vegetation don't suffer in the same heavy way cities do;This is my tweak guide to correct the game Anti Alising to an standard expected by a Next Gen title:http://steamcommunity.com/app/241560/discussions/0/617321352146025421/?tscn=1417713397Still considering the fact that at DAY 2 I'm trying to manually override what was delivered in the ""official pack"" , Customer Satisfaction is barely achieved on that aspect;- Looking for Dynamic Lighting and Shadows? Bad for you cause your car and whatever is capable of emitting light doesn't create any shadows! Ugly absurd issues from WatchDogs are all back to terrorize people dreams of playing decent games;- Your car is the only thing on the screen that seems to be made with more than 20 poligons. When compared with your own, all other cars and objects are ugly and seems to be toys or re-used models from games launched back from 90's - Specially Mini Vans - Maybe they have used the same from SEGA Crazy Taxi? Seems very similar to me. ** This can be minimized using my Anti Alising guide - check the LOD BIAS section **- Real bad textures. If you stay like 5 meters from any building you will few like playing GTA3. Ambient Occlusion made them feel more alive but they're all ugly and not even close to HD;- Dust and smoke effects from Counter Strike 1.6 are better than what we can see here;- Offline mode isn't working. You need to stay online on UPlay or, once you get in the game, it will ask you to connect to UPlay and restart it;- There is  no dynamic weather at all;- Engine sounds are very generic;TL;DR:As it is right now, there is no reason why you should buy this game for more than 20 dollars. If you want a good looking racing experience, buy Shadow of Mordor and ride a Warg. I ensure you that your experience would be better than any hype you may have here and you will have a really good game.Besides that, give the game some time to have Ubisoft to fix its outstanding issues and the magicians from the internet to discover what Ubisoft have disabled under the hood to make it similar to the console versions.

												So as you can see i have almost 1000 hours of gametime on The Crew.  I have played since the game was officially released and own almost every spec of every car.  When this game was released it got all kinds of terrible reviews but even at that time in it's incomplete state it was a good arcade style racing game compared to any NFS-type game before it.  Since that time they have added cars, stickers, colors, pvp options, graphics, race modes, bikes, monster trucks, 3 new specs (monster, drift, drag) in addition to the 5 already available (street, dirt, perf, raid, circuit), freedrive challenges, and tons of other things!  Some people will sit here and cry and complain about some technical issues with crashing, which is there from time to time, but with the amount of options they're adding to the game it's totally worth it.  Need For Speed is completely inferior to this game.  I have spent 125 dollars on this game including game, expansion pack, and season pass... I don't regret this at all because this game has been worth it!  There is no better open world arcade style racing game on the market right now (may 2016).			",75,5,7,5,7,1,7

Not even worth my time to play.This game is honestly not worth even sale price. this feels like a 2 or 3 dollar game I'd buy to mess around with friends but I wouldn;t want to inflect the horrerss of over priced dlc they cut from the game to make a quick buck.Not to mention it's 3rd party so you might as well buy it on uplay because you'll be logging in there anyways to play it.Face it ubisoft, Your games are rushed and ♥♥♥♥♥. Chopped up like ham for easy money.			",53,2,1,0,7,0,1

												To give you an idea i was in the beta before i had even pre-ordered the gold edition....I thought i liked this game and then game the delays, the broken servers, the crashing, no one on the servers, the microtransactions, the amount every car in the game costs ...seriously what car is that expensive, the falling through the map, the in car view is broken if you apply the handbrake during a turn, the buying of parts, the fact people were playing it before it was released, the broken physics, the fact that ive driven a 70s cadillac that feels like it would handle better than any of the cars in game, the fact that you dont get enough faction points or whatever to rank up at all seriously do you know how long a mission with good payout is. I still haven't been able to unlock my free supercar.Ubisoft screwed the pooch again...like right after you release one broken game you decide to release another how do you do this. It's like the level of glitches and broken code in new vegas, but without the modability. The game feels like alot of ubisofts other racing games as well but combined all recycled ideas to creat a steaming pile of ""idea"".The crew gold gives you a whole what 16 extra cars, for an extra $25. Think about that now that is alot of money for something i would consider what should be the size of one car pack. The crews Vehicle selection, what a fun topic. They seem to pick alot of old musclecars, some new muscle cars, some exotics, and 2 tuners..... a 370Z and an R34. No subaru's, no mitsubishi, no hondas, and no toyotas ""not even a supra, a legendary car"". Like do you hate imports that aren't considered exotics. If you do buy it wait a year until the price drops significantly, then also wait for a steam sale.			",77,3,7,9,4,1,3

Introduction:An open world MMO racing game. For what was presented and explained the game is great and got the job done. For how much devs were needed to created something like this a lot of things should have been different. Seems like they took more time on the map than the cars what you can do with them. Pros:Great graphicsHuge mapGreat wheel settingsGood netcodeGood story/SP missionsCons:Not a good amount of cars to choose from (compared to Forza Horizon 2 and others)Low max levelOnce you're done with the campaign there isn't much to do except race others and try to get other carsMoney is too hard to get compared to how much cars costSometimes you won't see another player for 1+ hoursConclusion:Overall it is a solid racing game but there are some things that I would have liked to see. Maybe wait for discounts.For more reviews check out  Original Curators Group  ",84,12,10,9,25,1,2

												This game is supposed to be an MMO but it hardly feels like it. There's really nobody to play with. When I try to play a mission in ""co-op"" it says there is nobody in my session. Also I can't see anybody on the map which is just...weird. This game is just single player in multiplayer...which means you have a single player game that you can only play online. This game is far from what it was advertised as. They showed us trailers which had multiple people playing together as a team but in reality not even a single bit of that happens. I can't even make a crew with my friend because it is bugged. I suggest staying away from this yet another bad release from Ubisoft.			",81,4,6,5,5,0,8

												To be honest, i've been waiting a game like this since NFS Most Wanted. An openworld racing, where you can free-drive even with your friends and its not full arcade play. You need to get used to it if you wanna play it seriously & smoothly. I can say that this is GOTY for me. Story line is not bad for a racing game, eventhough it was a bit rush-end. About Gold edition : It gives you some amount of Crew Credits (Not worth what you pay), Season pass and some cars like Ferrari, Dodge RAM etc. In my opinion, you don't need to buy gold edition if you don't mind about Crew Credits (Which you can use buying cars and kits if you don't have enough cash in game) Just buy the normal version + season pass, would be enough.10/10 would buy again.

Finally after getting the game to run it only took me about 5 minutes to be able to reproduce crashes regularly. This game has been out for almost a year and I can reproduce crashes five minutes into the main story.  There were also numerous random crashes. I thought this would be a good game. I really wanted it to be. But there is no game here. just a lot of restarting and crashing. 0/10 would not crash again			",111,9,8,12,5,0,11

It is not just disgusting begging for your money but it is unethical and also immoral. It reminds me NFS MW 2013 where you found the car you want to drive and the game pop up you the store page. That is unforgivable. What will be next? You want to grab this weapon dropped by dead enemy in some FPS? It will pop up the store with DLC in your basket. I really don´t understand why i buy games in these days. To pay twice and more times to have complete game? I don´t think so.			",377,89,34,42,33,9,43

												The Crew is a game with so much potential that it actually upsets me playing it at points. There are a few main points of contention I have with the game.#1. The car list.Maybe there were licensing issues or something along those lines but the car list in this game is a massive disappointment. If you're making a game set in the entirity of the US give us some good American cars. I'd love to see classics like your C2 or C3 Corvettes, Pontiac Trans Am, Impalas, '60s Mustangs and even weird obscure stuff like a Buick Grand National. Another thing is that for a game released in late 2014 all the 'new' cars seem to be a few years old. For example you have a 2010 Camaro, a 2010 Challenger, a 2010 370Z, a 2010 Continental Supersports, a 2009 Corvette ZR1, a 2010 BMW Z4, A 2011 M5, a 2010 Focus RS, a 2011 Mustang, a 2012 V8 Vantage,a 2010 Viper, a 2011 Grand Cherokee, a 2011 F150 Raptor and a 2011 McLaren 12C. Maybe it was due to a lengthy dev time but it just seems strange to have a new racing game with a car list this slightly dated. Another thing that annoys me about the car list is that there is an R34 GT-R V-Spec that is Left Hand Drive, they only ever made them RHD that's why Americans who are into ""JDM"" (That's another rant for another time) go crazy for them.#2. The customisation.The vehicle customisation in this game is odd in that it's very in depth but also very limited. An example would be that I can put a stripe on my car but I can't change the colour of that stripe. All I want is a purple Camaro with a green stripe to give other players their daily dose but because of the arbitrary restrictions in the customisation menus I can't. All they had to do was emulate Forza or one of the PS2 era NFS games but Ivory Tower screwed that up.#3. The vehicle classes.When this game was hyped in pre release and during the beta it was shown that every car could be used in every class (Street, Dirt, Perf, Raid and Circuit) but when the game was released there were restrictions and limitations as to what car can be used with what class. For example a Golf GTI can only be used in Street spec which sucks because Street spec is garbage. A Dirt or Perf spec GTI would be fantastic but it can't happen because the game says so.#4. The Physics.Not necessarily the driving physics, they're fine but they do start out pretty terrible (they improve as your car improves) but the crash physics and impact physics are screwed up beyond belief with my cars commonly performing physically impossible maneuvers. Another thing that isn't entirely physics related is that during the start of every race an animation plays where you cars rear wheels spin even if you have a front or all wheel drive car, as someone who likes detail in their driving games this upsets me greatly.#5. Crew Credits.They're a currency you buy with real money. Need I say more?#6. The ""MMO"" aspect.This game is not an MMO. Ubisoft are lying to you, it might be multiplayer but it is 8 people per server and with a map this large you are spread out most of the time and barely have any interaction. The 'Never Drive Alone' tag was a lie as I spent most of my hours in this game driving alone.What this game needs is a sequel made by more competent devs and with more attention to the little details. It also shouldn't be marketed as an MMO because it isn't.			",106,16,2,10,5,0,4

												The Crew™ is probably the best car game I've ever played! There are a lot of cars to discover and drive. You can tune and customize your car almost just as you want. I bought the Gold Edition becuase i have seen the game on YouTube and knew that this game was made for those who both like good stories and cars. The story in The Crew™ is probably something I've never seen before. With a lot of action in this game, I could easily give this a 10/10! And for the extra feeling of driving a real car, buy the Logitech g27 Racing Wheel. I highly recommend this beautiful game.			",49,4,2,2,6,1,2

Bear at mind there is a few issues with the servers regarding random disconnects at the time of this review but should improve over next week or so. There isn't a pay to win system as far as I can tell. You could buy a Laferria and still be smoked by any car that's spec out proprely as well as the skill points which have to be earned.It's a strong solid reccomedation on my book if you like racing games or you just want to travel coast to coast with your friends.

												Wild Run addon is disappointing to me. For cost of half of basic game you get in fact nothing. Oh yea, you can still pay further and buy motorbikes but even this is not possible straight on Steam - you are redirected to other page which does not belong to Steam. I am not a die hard fan of this game so I am not into spending tens of hours to slowly earn game's coins to be able to ride a bike. At least one bike should be accessible straight by buying the DLC, otherwise, for me it is waste of money.And one more thing: why the game does not turn off when I quit? Steam hour counter for the game still works and I can't get rid of it until next PC restart, so in fact hours count spent with this game is false.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hey, this is the best open world driving sim so far. It's like TDU but better, prettier, more exciting. I would also really like to see usable Petrol Stations, Motorbikes as well as radio playing my own mp3 songs, GPS that looks like the real one, playable slot machines.

Its fun to play with friends but its deffinatly not a serious racing game which is a shame because i really really wanted it to be.The game improved when i started racing in Hardcore you do actually start to feel things differently, but things like when im racing online i get stuck in the floor and my car shoots 50ft in the air is just not ok for how long its been out.Iv recommended this to many of my mates and we have had our fun but just repeating pvp races over and over does get boring pretty quick.10/10 IGNP.S Car Customization is Gash ",44,3,3,5,3,0,1

												the crew. its kinda like Test Drive Ulimited. but much better,its a great looking game trully looks great. and most of the time it feels great. it really depends on if you like to use a wheel with force feedback or not. i think people who got the game and never played it with force feedback wheel will never have any complaints. but the force feedback issues are still around.i have to say i really like most of the force feedback feeling in the game its very good. but sometimes it can get too stong and i think mostly thats been sorted out. or so they say it has. i still notice things i really dont like about the force feedback. like the wheel going light on you and all of a sudden strong force again. i wish they had put more time into the force feedback because they did half a good job. its just a massive shame they did not do a fully good job. it would have really improved the game for me. even with the xml file you can find online for extraconfig xml.. it still doesnt feel perfect. and is messy. i just find it such a shame. because the game itself is very good. especially for a ubisoft game. its great game. but they messed up the force feedback and they dont seem to care much about getting it right. or listening to the gamers issues.  but its playable and fun,			",118,8,23,5,12,0,0

												This game might not have the best driving/ racing interface nor are the graphics that spectacular, but the Open world is massive and fun to drive around in.  When you're done with the story progression, you're left with an open world that is full of challenges, and fun things to do, one of my favorite being stalking other drivers.			",93,5,3,10,5,0,11

												This game is fun and realistic in some ways than others. The inside view from your car is a nice touch that won me over. They should think about adding more muscle cars, i.e., the 1970 Chevy El Camino and the 1979 Chevy Camaro Z28 to name a few. Some of the missions were tough to beat. There's still room for improvement, but its going well			",102,3,2,3,6,0,0

												I've almost never raced in this racing game. It's a driving experience. Whenever you want to feel comfy, you get a friend who also plays this game and drive around the US. Put a cool music in the background and enjoy. After the recent graphical update it looks way better and runs better too. The only DLC I would consider buying would be a Europe map or something. That would be nice to drive around.			",187,36,4,9,12,1,16

												Well, i figured i might aswell write my first review as a review of this game. I just completed it today. Today being 4 days after i got it, and i've racked up just over 23 hours of playtime. And oh boy. Summed up, this game is essentially the result of throwing Test Drive Unlimited 2, Driver: San Fransisco and Need For Speed: Undercover intro a breeding pen together. Being a massive fan of TDU and the Driver series, i'd say that sounds pretty damn good. It has the exploration and collectibles of TDU2, the ""undercover ex-street racer who was jailed up but picked by the FBI to catch bad guys"" plotline, which i suppose is a mix of D:SF and NFSU, and then the attention to detail around the maps and customization of TDU2. The plotline is pretty short. Like i mentioned earlier, i completed the storyline within 23 hours, and that's with quite some extra time added into exploration. You could probably sprint trough the game in 17/18 hours. Though, the exploration is what makes this game so enjoyable. Like, for ♥♥♥♥'s sake, there's a unicorn and a bigfoot walking around for you to almost run over in your Paris-Dakar specced muscle cars and circuit spec classic cruisemobiles. The map is large. Very, very large. It's basically the entire US, and even though it's downscaled, you'll still spend over an hour getting from one end of the map to the other. It's also surprisingly well detailed, with a ton of stuff to discover, like a giant ski jump to launch your car off, or 5 different race tracks, or wrecked cars, which is another thing very similar to TDU2. It's a good time if you enjoy cars and exploring ♥♥♥♥. Oh, and TD;LR if you can't be arsed to read my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review:  Ubisoft didn't ♥♥♥♥ up  ",51,3,12,4,21,1,5

												I'll be honest: I was hyped as hell when i first saw the trailer.But I waited it to go on sale, and downloaded the trial version first. I was scared by the huge amount of negative reviews.I bought the standard version, no DLC, no Season Pass, they will come later, maybe, we'll see.The Season Pass is tempting me, but 24€ is just a little too much. I'll wait a sale.The driving feel and physics: doesn't feel totally right, I've had better, but it's not so awful as many had depict. Maybe it's just my steering settings, need to look into it some more.Rubberbanding AI: not found. Both when I got the lead and when I was behind, I felt no rubberbanding from the AI cars. Drive clean, with no mistakes, and who's behind will stay behind.Little update: the rubberbanding is noticeable in long races (>30 min), otherwise is pretty much nonexistant.It is not a simulator, at all.Later I'll add some more details, I need to go deeper in the game experience. Until then, it's a 7/10.Get it when on sale (30-50%).EDIT, 1/8: Damn me I bought the SP. Worth. Cars are really well made, only thing that bothers me are mirrors not working. In 2015. Come on Ivory Tower, you can do better than this. Still a 7/10 and still worth, even more if you have 2-3 friends to race with.PvPs are demolition derbies, never seen such unsportsmanship.Fun thing to do is dodge the oncoming opponent, watch the wannabe rear-ender fly down a cliff and taste his salty tears as he insults you in french.EDIT, 21/8/16: More than one year is passed and I STILL CAN'T GET ENOUGH of this game!However, some things really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off:- Wild Run and the incoming Calling All Units are not included in the Season Pass. Need more money, Ubi?- ""Smart Loot"" my ♥♥♥♥. Getting end-tier car parts is now an almost impossible task with all the useless vinyl/paint/rims drops. Either farm money and buy the parts from the tuner shop or get ready for some serious grinding.- Wild Run adds pretty much nothing compared to its price. No story, no challenges, no trials, nothing. Also, bikes behave like cars and your monster truck behaves like a normal car (don't expect to ramp through traffic Monster Jam style).- Car physics are a little too much uniform. Raid cars, for example: a 1750kg Dodge RAM jumps and swerves like a 950kg Porsche. Not good.- WE (at least I, for what is worth) NEED SOME BASIC CAR SETTINGS. High-end gearbox parts have ratios too low, the car in 5th gear does not pull without NO2. Only way to tune gear ratios is to install lower tier parts. ABSOLUTELY not good.- Still can't use custom music in the in-game radio. Seriously? Come on.The vote is still a 7/10, get it if you like roam around with some music (played in VLC), don't get Wild Run.Also, people complaining about game not working with Nvidia drivers or new GPUs: I have drivers version 372 with a GTX1070.

												I love the size of this game. Nothing can prepare you for how big it is. The story line is rather shallow and pointless so far (I have yet to complete it). The driving has a mostly arcade feel to it but is not too insane. The cars are a lot of fun to drive and there is plenty to do. The game is very pretty to look at. Even at only medium settings. I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who liked to 2005 Need for Speed Most Wanted or Need for Speed Underground series.			",48,1,0,4,3,0,1

												I'll give it an 8.5. The cars you can customize drive better the further they are leveled up. I always drive alone as i can't get anyone to be on my Crew.I'm at level 35 on Pc version as of 12.6.14. Would be better if the cars didn't spin out so much when they get hit. Cops are annoying & sure bust you quick once your stopped. Would be better is the tires didn't spin so easiy when using nitrous. Some of the cars such as in the Infinity Challenge just can't grip even the road when they near their top speed,Who ever heard of a super car hydro-plaining within their operating designed limits, Would be better in there weren't so many wheel choices of the same rims in 3 colors, would be awesome if we could just powder coat the rims in our choice of colors. That would eliminate so many rim choices. The Crew is the best racing game since Driver San francisco & Need 4 Speed The Run for sure. I'm sure Need 4 Speed Franchise needs to get with the game & not be so limited in it's predictable game style of very limited customization choices. Nuff said			",23,0,4,0,0,0,0

												PERSONAL OPINION Well, I'm going to tell you that this game needs a friend. Unfortunately, it doesn't come with one guaranteed.When I played this game/ both alone and with a friend, it is the absolute best racing/driving game I have ever played.No, I don't understand why there's so much hate. What do all those haters play, Need for Speed Rivals?All jokes aside; this game is definitely better than its competitors at its gen. I enjoyed this game thoroughly, and would rate it 98/100 (1 point minus for minor connectivity issues, 1 point minus for bad ending) Let me start with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ map. Yes, the freaking huge map. And its not just 90% emptiness, no no no no....Its probably one of the largest maps in gaming history. I'm pretty sure it could go par against Guild Wars 2 in map size.Next up is the main story sequence. Overall, the story was NeedForSpeedMostWanted(2005)-ish and really pushes you to want to know more. Its not shakespeare but hey, I found it to fit okay.The cars in the game are well modeled (except their bottom; but who the hell looks there), and there is a pretty good level of car-modding. Okay, not Need For Speed Carbon/UG2 level, but at least around NFSMostWanted(2005) level. The paints choices are great, and the vinyl choices are not bad. They should make more though.I don't think there is alot of cars in the game, and before people start chirping the game because you can purchase cars; you can finish the game and get the best car without paying a single extra dollar. Just don't pay heed to purchasable cars and you're good. I personally liked their car choices; despite the low car count.The AI in the game (which some saw glitching) was actually flawless for me. They are pretty smart, and I'm pretty sure they are much better AI than that of older racing games. This is because the AI will not let you grind onto them or use them as ""padding"" as you make a sharp turn with them. They will speed up or slow down to make you screw up. It makes the game have a level of challenging in it.Okay, you got me here. The handling. Its not great is it? Well, I'm going to tell you that to each his own because me and my friend both just got used to it. I know, its kinda annoying, but it makes it a tad bit more challenging. It kinda forces you to learn how to properly turn and drift. Not sure if its realistic, but that doesn't matter for me anyway, it wasn't the end of the game. The graphics. This stuff is not your Driveclub or Forza graphics. But its definitely the right gen. I can barely run it with my computer but it looks amazing. Although there are some blotchy textures in shady places, the surrounding game has some good texturing.The Audio is good, but could use a little bit more bass/could sound more heavy.All the different specs you can get for your car, these are what fill in the ""not enough customization"" and ""not enough cars"" gap. The specs and their upgrades are well done, and they give the cars more specialization in what they do.The performance parts in the game are acquired by the means of completing mini-challenges or buying them at high levels. Of course, I didn't mind this as much but I could see why people would prefer buying them. Plus the model of the vehicle's inside does not change, no matter which performance part you pick. I did not have this game crash too many times, only twice from my many hours of playing and also once because my Eyefinity is not really compatible. I didn't find any bugs so far (minus my friend apparently being able do drive underwater once). The PVP in this game was decent, and the MMO-thing is not the biggest thing about the game. I played with a friend; as I said before, and we both really enjoyed this game.The challenges are a bit silly, but they are great in the case that someone wants to get some quick cash. The game's economy isn't that bad. Worth every dime of my 40$. TLDR; 98/100, huge map, get a friend, ending sucks, but overall an enjoyable game.			",47,0,1,1,3,0,3

Really easy to just sit back and drive.If you like a more chalenging racing sim this is not it, But if you just want to drive some nice cars around fast then I would recomend. 9.5/10			",433,54,20,41,65,5,67

												I bought this game when it was still brand new for 60 dollars. It was definitely not worth that much. If you find it on sale and are considering buying it make sure you're not going to buy it for the multiplayer because it's dead. Everytime I tried to go online with it I was never able to get into a lobby with a good amount of players. I had a lot of hope for this game because of how large the map is but when I started playing it I realized that the map is not even close to being realistic. The storyline is alright but not perfect. If you find it cheap I would recommend you try it out because I did love the car customization and how much detail they put into that part of the game. Overall Score 6/10.			",37,2,2,3,2,0,0

												Updated: This is my final review. All of my review on thia game are base on gameplay and its features except story plot, as I always skip them like I do in other race game (except Split Second <3 ). If you have experience in Need For Speed Underground 2/Most Wanted (old), then you might have a same experience in The Crew, with different styles of course. Graphic is ok actually, and the control or handling car aren't that bad. So far it is good, it's cool to see other players during roam mode. Basicly the PvP (non crew pvp) is just same like other race game such Dirt 2, however, instead require host create a a lobby and organize the event, The Crew players that joined the lobby will vote which event they want to try. Haven't try yet the Crew vs Crew PvP (aka team vs team). Event after try I wont update anymore. xPDo caution that server in co-op/PvP is really terrible, most of time you'll get disconnected issue, not sure is this is really base on player's internet connection or it's the game's server issue..There's no rubberband Ai like those negative said, it's just normal Ai like other racing game. There's no perfect and logic Ai. It's yours skills to how you deal with them. Here's my screenshot.

Here's about Ai info I've been meet:Racer: •Like other game they sometimes can bit speedy or slow, even they speed is same as your. But as I said before, it's about your skills. For me, most Ai racer are very easy to handle. •Most of them stick into they waypoint, lika a train rail. There's a mission that I saw the same car hit on a truck twice (I retry the mission and yea, it occur on same place, same time). But meh, I play other race game before so its just normal.•A Take Down mission really annoying. Dunno how to explain lol.Cops, Police:•All right.. So far I only see two way to trigger chase. 1st, hit anything inside 'Police Watch' area, until they trigger chase. 2nd way is, hit the police car if you see them. If you guys know other way (than mission), please let me know coz its fun trolling them xP•All police just do is only ramming you. The star wanted level seems only increase number of police chasing you, road block and heli. Seriously roadblock is pretty ridiculous, only 1 police car block, with signal obstacles, in any wanted level. Please do not run from them by trying taking offroad, they'll chase you with dirt specs, also with heli, which is really difficult to escape if your car were using non raid/dirt spec. It was hell for me to run from them using Golf inaide forest but it was fun. xDNote: For those people who is don't have a clue about trial issue, copy your CD key in Steam Library and paste it at Active Product on uPlay.Please also do note that the trailer is too promising. I suggest you to try demo 1st. Well, it's still fun and cool racing game I ever played, 2nd of my fav after Split Second.Here's my review so far:-Pros:Big detailed mapAble to see other players roaming around. It's cool!Nice graphicSomewhat it's challenging. Seriously, sometimes there's too many cars (obstacles) on trafficNo cut-scene crash/accident like Need For Speed series (if you think this is cons it is pro for me. I hate when speeding in race or in free roaming, or while eescaping from police you got crash and then a cut-screen, slowing down you).Support are nice, I guess.Most time updateGreat communityCrew vs Crew PvP systemGreat car customization. You can tune your car to into various specs which is street, dirt (rally actually..), raid, circuit. You can't tune Stock specs but you can customize its visual on your HQ.8 players on each roam map is great, I guess.. Assuming enable more players will make the map lag, like most online game I played. Even though the map is very super large scaled getting lag will make player frustrated and stop play. This is my experienced in most online game. At least for me.Cons:Crew Credits systems in-game, in PAID games. Some car cannot bought through bucks. This should not happen. (Note: ingame progress you'll receive free 100k crew credit once. But as I said, Crew Credit supposedly not exist since this paid game, also can make game unbalanced.Season Pass benefit kinda unfair for me. Plus it is expensive, not worth for its features. DLC also expensive.Kinda unrealistic physics.Must have internet connection to play.Ingame player's profile avatar are using uPlay avatar, and can't upload/customize ingame profile avatar like the trailer.. This is so frustrating, stupid, and horrible..Thats all from me. :)My rate: 8/10			",40,8,3,6,0,0,1

												They're giving it away for free right now, so you may as well give it a shot.Got it on sale, I definitely wouldn't buy it for full price. Graphics are pretty good, car exterior detail and rain are especially attention grabbing. The car sounds are really weird and probably a weak point-it sounds like they were synthesized rather than recorded. The game world is huge and the detail is pretty good considering the size, but it feels a lot emptier than any of the competition. The driving physics are pretty good and beginner-friendly and you can turn off the assists if you want. Nothing on the level of say, Forza Horizon but much better than Need For Speed 2015. The tuning is probably the biggest advantage-there are a ton of parts for every car. Bodykits, interiors, wheels etc and many cars have widebody versions in the ""Perf"" tuning spec. That brings me to the car selection. There are about 60, I think, plus their various tuning kits. This would be fine but the selection is a bit dumb- we get a Cadillac Escalade but no CTSV for instance. Attention to detail is where a lot of the cars fall apart-cockpit gauges are often off, or in some cases don't even work. You also can't sell off unwanted cars either which I don't get. The money system is annoying but not horrible. The game doesn't nickel and dime you that bad and you can make a lot doing skills and just drifting around, but the system is definitely skewed to try and get you to buy stuff. Cars especially are super expensive but you can test drive them before you buy which is nice. Parts are cheap though and handed out for free for doing skills.It's a fun game but the world feels a bit dead at times and a lot of car appearance and spec details are overlooked. You can get lost just driving around for a long time though, and you can turn off the road at any time. Pick it up while it's free or try the trial and wait for a sale.			",37,2,1,1,2,0,0

In depth missions and public events so you can meet new people and recruit them to your ""Crew"". Full customization of your car in different specs, or classifications, of vehicles.

The ""easy"" mode from the Crew is not very satisfying tbh)One of the few horrible things with The Crew is the post mission HUD. It is just so stupid to have to wait many seconds on a screen about a challenge (mainly if you are under a police pursuit) just to find out you earned 250B. We should be able to just bash Enter/A(for controller) and go quickly through the menu.Aaand one thing that drives me mad are the police pursuits. Sometimes if you hit the rear of a police car, you just get stuck (you cant even reverse, the game bugs. Sometimes that happens even at stationary cars when you are NOT the most wanted) and that you cant just turn around and reverse during a pursuit without being arrested. ",69,4,7,8,8,0,9

												I genuinely like the crew as long as you make sure you purchase Wild Run this dramatically improves vehicle handling and adds motorbikes and monstertrucks to the mix as well as dynamic weather and visual improvements. The map scale is truely impressive and the car models are of very high quality making ownership of these cars a real joy to cruise around in. The sigleplayer Story expeience is always down to the wire with nailbiting races and the AI can screw up although not as much as a human will.The Multiplayer option is good and encourages competition as well as working together to finish that hard as balls mission.The in vehicle views and bonet views are very well done and add to the immersion.If I had anything negative to say it would be about inapp-purchases. NO Ubisoft NO. I want to be able to earn my vehicle and drive against players that have earned their new rides instead of people who can just buy the best vehicle and get all the advantages from that.PROS : Graphically stunning as long as you have Wild Run. Incredible scale and detail to the map it truly is MASSIVE! Vehicle Models are of the highest quality. A genuinely fun and exciting story fo the campaign (although generic)AI vehicles can screw up making it more realistic. CONS:INAPP-PURCHASES gives some players unfair advantage over a player who earns their vehicle in game . I don't expect to pay any more when Iv'e supposedly bought the whole game. Get rid of inapp-purchases for sanity's sake it cheapens the whole product.AI drivers can be TOO smart never missing corners and seemingly completing courses with ease they also recover way too quickly as opposed to the player who is heavily penalized for screwing up.

												-Short and Sweet-If you know what your buying, did your research and understand its an MMO-R-RPG, with future free updates and DLC, Know what it is: Arcade-ish, Horizontal progression, minor vertical progression, open-world. Know what it is not: Not realistic racer, no massive important story, a game thats been out for a long time. Side notes: the BS thats being said about fixing up your cars, complete BS, Every spec, every car has its own style and body parts, i havent seen a clone of my skyline yet. Also iv been helped out by lvl 50's many times, just my Quick Cooping, iv made friends and raced on open streets for no good reason. Story missions done with rando's then friend requested. The car parts are like MMO's loot systems, you gotta complete something to get the upgrade part.Theres a lot of BS comments revolving around this game.The game is what you make it.

The pvp events are nice, and the map is just amazingly huge. LOVE IT!			",27,0,0,0,2,0,0

												Let me begin by saying I do not have much experience with racing games, I am not a big racing fan. With this in mind I will continue my review.  I really liked the Crew, I have played it a little bit and I took place in the Wild Run beta testing. Overall I would say the game is a fun racing game, and it has some beautiful, and amazing environments in game. Driving coast to coast is an experience, and there is even a miniature version of my city in this tiny version of America. I will admit the actual driving can be a little clunky at times, but I feel that the other features and all the crew based gameplay makes up for it.  I have not played the Crew much, but I can at least say that there is not much it compares to. I haven't played many open world racing games like the crew, but I can say this, it seems well made, especially for a Ubisoft game. If you are still reading this far into my review, you should know that I recommend the Crew to street racing fans, and fans of open world racing games. That being said I must warn you that the Crew comes with Uplay, it is a Ubisoft game, with all that entails.			",374,143,14,85,57,11,89

												There's not too much to say about this game, but I feel obligated to write a review after enjoying ~150hrs of it. The Crew is an open world arcade style driving game with nice graphics and a whole lot of space to cruise around. There are around 70+ cars I believe, and that number increases every month. The game has minor updates pretty regularly, with a large update happening every few months.I'd say it's worth the $30 price tag, assuming you don't mind the lack of realism, but ideally you'll want to wait for a sale.I'm willing to answer any further questions in the comments, and will update this review if necessary.

												I bought this during the Steam Christmas sale (2016). I got The Crew and the Crew Wild Run for about $20.  WELL WORTH IT. NOTE: Activate your CD KEy within Uplay, otherwise, you will be stuck on The Crew Wild Run beta. Pretty stupid, I know, but it took me a little while to figure that out since its not an official steam game. You can get a great deal on this game for the content you receive if you wait for it on sale.The driving style is more arcade-ish,  kind of like the Burnout series. Downsides:    You receive the occasional framerate drop from 60 to about 50 in bigger cities such as Los Angeles due to the higher volume of traffic.     The story is good, but the story missions are kind of repetitive. Hopefully, they can mix it up a little more in the sequel (if they decide to make one).			",77,1,4,5,0,0,0

												So I bought this game day 1, when it came out on 360, and too be honest, it was dissappoining then. However, since then this game has become much better. There are still a few things that need to be addressed. Until the Cops vs Racers update, I'd give it a 7/10. Once the new update is here, depending on what gets fixed, it might go up.1) Open world. And I mean OPEN WORLD. The map is immense, go any where you want to go. It literally takes almost an hour to drive at 150mph to get from NY to LA, and that's if you don't get distracted by something shiny. 2)Envornment. Might not make a difference in how your vehicle handles. However the change from forest to snowy mountains to desert adds life to the game. the addition of wildlife also adds a nice touch. challenging when your going 180mph in a McLaren and then DEER!!!!3)AI. Ubisoft still has some work to do on this one. However, compared to what it was at the beginning, massivly better. The cities actually feel like their alive to a point. Its also neat when your in the countryside, theres no where near as much traffic as in the city.4)DLC. I know most people don't like paying for extra game. However, the DLCs have brought much needed content to the game, and has greatly added to the depth of the game.5)Graphics. They are just fantastic to look at, and i have a $50 low resolution TV, so imagine if a High-def TV is used. I can see the individual drops of rain on the windshield.6)The cars. What car game can be complete  without the cars. I still felt that there were too few cars, maybe about 35 total with the DLC. They have been adding new cars for free however, so there's still hope for this one.7)Cops. Ok so this is probably my biggest irritant. The cops are well, easy to beat. They don't really present a challange. However, they do set up roadblocks, PIT you, and they have even down the rolling box on me. However it is so easy to get away. On this one, Im waiting too see what happens with the new cops vs racers uodate in November. 8) Physics. Kindy goofy. For those looking for a simulator level of driving, go look elsewhere. Its got a arcady feel to it, which for me its fine. If I wanted simulater I'd go play Forza.9)Always online. With good internet connection, you can still play and not deal with anyone else. They'll still be there, but it doesn't force you to interact with them. However it would be nice too have a offline option. Eventually Ubisoft will have to add it in. They cant keep the servers up forever.10)Story. Really short. Feels kind of forced at times, and makes you go ""wha"" at times. But i didnt get tis game to watch cutscenes, i got it to take a sportscar off roading and launching it off cliffs, because why the F--- not.Overall, I give this game 7/10. It is fun racing game that can make hours dissappear. Id wait til its on sale to get it. Get the one woth all the packs. It'll make the game that much better too play.			",86,0,13,4,13,1,1

												They're giving it away for free right now, so you may as well give it a shot.Got it on sale, I definitely wouldn't buy it for full price. Graphics are pretty good, car exterior detail and rain are especially attention grabbing. The car sounds are really weird and probably a weak point-it sounds like they were synthesized rather than recorded. The game world is huge and the detail is pretty good considering the size, but it feels a lot emptier than any of the competition. The driving physics are pretty good and beginner-friendly and you can turn off the assists if you want. Nothing on the level of say, Forza Horizon but much better than Need For Speed 2015. The tuning is probably the biggest advantage-there are a ton of parts for every car. Bodykits, interiors, wheels etc and many cars have widebody versions in the ""Perf"" tuning spec. That brings me to the car selection. There are about 60, I think, plus their various tuning kits. This would be fine but the selection is a bit dumb- we get a Cadillac Escalade but no CTSV for instance. Attention to detail is where a lot of the cars fall apart-cockpit gauges are often off, or in some cases don't even work. You also can't sell off unwanted cars either which I don't get. The money system is annoying but not horrible. The game doesn't nickel and dime you that bad and you can make a lot doing skills and just drifting around, but the system is definitely skewed to try and get you to buy stuff. Cars especially are super expensive but you can test drive them before you buy which is nice. Parts are cheap though and handed out for free for doing skills.It's a fun game but the world feels a bit dead at times and a lot of car appearance and spec details are overlooked. You can get lost just driving around for a long time though, and you can turn off the road at any time. Pick it up while it's free or try the trial and wait for a sale.			",37,2,1,1,2,0,0

												the crew. its kinda like Test Drive Ulimited. but much better,its a great looking game trully looks great. and most of the time it feels great. it really depends on if you like to use a wheel with force feedback or not. i think people who got the game and never played it with force feedback wheel will never have any complaints. but the force feedback issues are still around.i have to say i really like most of the force feedback feeling in the game its very good. but sometimes it can get too stong and i think mostly thats been sorted out. or so they say it has. i still notice things i really dont like about the force feedback. like the wheel going light on you and all of a sudden strong force again. i wish they had put more time into the force feedback because they did half a good job. its just a massive shame they did not do a fully good job. it would have really improved the game for me. even with the xml file you can find online for extraconfig xml.. it still doesnt feel perfect. and is messy. i just find it such a shame. because the game itself is very good. especially for a ubisoft game. its great game. but they messed up the force feedback and they dont seem to care much about getting it right. or listening to the gamers issues.  but its playable and fun,			",118,8,23,5,12,0,0

												I haven't played a racing game since Gran Turismo 2 and when I got the closed beta invite, I figured why not?  I was hooked during beta and couldn't wait for the game comes out.  I got the pre-release and I'm loving it.  Keep in mind I'm not comparing to other racing games so I'm probably missing out on things other games offers.			",50,1,2,13,8,0,10

												Love it, the game is so much of what we all hoped for from NFS and TDU series. What they were supposed to be and then some.  I have longed for a MMO Racing game that was just that.  A ""MMO"" racing game... Since the days of MCO, we finally have one.  I just really hope the MS doesn't kill it, turn it into P2W, and that the prices are REASONABLE!!!  Now if they would just add a few more trucks and (before the tuner haters start ranting) that they add Scion.  Look'em up, they are winning like mad!  (and hey, the tC and FRS are good lookin! don't deny it you muscle car lovers =P )  But really though, go check out the vids on youtube!   So looking forward to the game expanding, so much potential with such a great idea!(aside from the normal dose of haxlet nubtart basement dwelling trolls, the ones on here don't seem to grasp the concept of ""crews"" nor factions in this game.)I did the closed beta and even at that time with bugs and adjustments needed in phsyics/mechanics it was a blast to play.  The cars look great, although the car audio could use some attention to make them sound more like the real deals IMO.  Have any questions, feel free to ask!Also IMO, the gold will be worth it.  Look forward to hating some tires on Dec. 2nd!Well now after launch I still don't change my opinion!  I have noticed a bit more lag than beta and had a crash.  In beta I had less lag and no crashes lol.   If you didn't get the pre-order you missed out on some cool content.  Any questions as I said before; Feel free to askLag has lessend quite a bit and still waiting on the patches.  They are starting to make a habbit of not really supporting the games after release.  Still though I do reccomend the game, just wait for a sale.  If they fixed the sync issues and a few other bugs that can hinder game play a bit, it would be well worth the full price.Well after playing and waiting, it is about half of what they promised.  Not suprised as Ubisoft is making a habbit and trend of this crap.  With the issues of being able to see other players and ""co-op""  still giving a problem, with NAT issues.  It can be fun when you can actually play with others and find people that actually have a clue as to what The Crew is supposed to be.  Still say it's not worth full price, but it is free to play monthly, So... If you are still on the fence, I suggest wathcing some streams or Youtube vids.			",173,8,7,21,18,0,16

												Just finished the single-player campaign, or whatever you wanna call the story missions, cause you can do them in co-op as well. Anyway, the game is not finished, yet enjoyable for a very specific crowd. Let me explain. At a very technical level, the game is not where it should be. Laggy and stuttery even on an FX-9590 and 290x, tendency to cook a water cooled processor that doesn't go past 58 in Prime95, and almost unplayable on a mobile platform with an A10-5750M and M290x. If you can muster better specs and get it to be playable and responsive, you'll run into their side of the hardware issues, meaning the server. It might not pe hardware though, but still technical. On some networks it works, on others it doesn't, and it will disconnect every now and then in the middle of one of those hour long races, and you'll have to do it all over again. So, if these are things that you think you can look past just to get a glimpse of the sunset from the Grand Canyon behind the wheel of a LaFerrari, this is the game for you. It looks amazing, the cars sound fantastic, and on hardcore driving mode the driving model is brilliantly tuned for a very good mix of arcade and sort of simulator. Not a simulator in the actual sense, just that it follows a few rules that arcade racers usually don't. Say you're in a controlled power slide, or a drift, and one of your back wheels hits the dirt on the outside of the bend, or the snow, or even a wet patch, you will lose control of the car, because the back end loses grip completely. That is a very nice touch. So, driving model not bad at all, but not a full on simulator by any means. The story itself is a cliche, obviously, you've heard it a million times if you're into this culture, or have ever played a NFS game or seen an FnF movie. Bad guy kills/betrays your brother/mother/sister/any other signifcant family members and then you seek to get revenge by driving fast and breaking the law almost all the way. Nevertheless, this story is told well, with good quality cut-scenes and voice acting. Also, the missions themselves are quite fun, at least at first, because later on the same challanges are presented for the lack of more then 3 or 4 modes. You get the normal checkpoint race, checkpoint time trial, a sort of destruction derby against the clock, where you need to catch and bash into the opponent several times until a health bar hovering over his/her car is depleted. This one is quite interesting and fun, until they pit you against a prison bus that can keep up with a modified Mustang that can do 300 KM/h. Funny, but frustrating after the fifth try. Also has the health or relisience of a prison bus. There's another mode which I shall call ""touch the package"" because it can be interpreted in several ways, and I love a good internal debate. Anyway, this one puts you on a course, against the time, in which there are 100 packages on the ground, the story will explain why they are there, don't worry, not as stupid as it sounds. You have to, within that time limit, hit 80 of those boxes. Sounds easy? Pah. Difficult, but fun.As a whole experience, because there is much more to talk about, and I can't be bothered because it's my night off, and I just wanted to share my general opinion about The Crew, the game is enjoyable if you like cars and the whole customization, FnF and NFSU heritage stuff. For the car enthusiast, the flaws are not there to disturb, we keep hoping that eventually they will be patched, because they are obvious, yet we look beyond them and enjoy good looking and sounding cars, that drive in an impressively fun and engaging manner, amongst scenery that you will probably only get to see in game. By the way, the map is a smaller version of the United States, with little versions of New York, Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and many other major US cities. Basically, you get to drive across America. And, also important, in my opinion, you can modify your cars in pretty fine detail, and the body parts available are very good looking, and have that racy feel, not the silly Underground toy looking things. You can put together a very good looking off-road version of a 2011 Mustang with 800 horses under the hood. Pretty cool. Thumbs up, but please work on those performance issues at least. Thank you.

												First of all, Use Voice chat, vent, skype TS, whatever, just communicate with people. Probably one of the best arcade racer I've ever experienced. that's something.Let's get something straight. Arcade racers are racing games that have selective physics to allow fun things to happen.If you are like me, someone who clocked 1000+ hours into Gran Turismo, played every racing game from F-Zero,CTR,Top gear,F1 simulators, to Racing lagoon. you don't expect anything to ever blow your mind again.Heck, after NFS after NFS, I started to believe arcade racers have nothing to deliver.This proved me wrong. Fantastically crafted balance of doing what's expected of a racing game, and taking itself seriously without being pretentious. > PhysicsThe physics are well crafted to do what it's supposed to, The hitboxes are somewhat forgiving as they will let you scrape past a crash or dodge trees from time to time, (unlike Forza where entering a corner wrong is kinda...fatal) It doesn't make you OCD about keeping your car in control like GT, and is both a relaxing and exciting experience.> VisualsIf you have a good PC, the visuals are quite decent, the topper is the cinematic value of an active racetrack. The game is light and easy enough for you to enjoy the cranes and planes, and steam leaks, strategically placed to block you from seeing stuff ahead is a nice touch.> StoryThe storyline? I didn't care for it at first, but it started to get better, unexpectedly good for something so cliche and dead on hollywood scriptwriting theories, The characters have a lot of depth for a racing game. It demonstrates there's nothing wrong with cliches, if it's done right. The end feels fulfilling and I'd totally get DLC for some of the character side storiesThe game is meant to be played together, the story is written so you can talk ♥♥♥♥ about it. It's not groundbreaking but it does the job right, something I haven't seen in racing games in a long time.(Willing suspension of disbelief regarding ""driving fixes problems"" is required. though much less than a michael bay movie)> GameplayIt's broken the line of pathetic cops game after game, where you can just ""go vroom vroom really fast"" and get away. It's a fantastic breath of fresh air. The cops actually do something. They will stop you if you drive stupidly behind them, you react to their radio as it gives you clues when they're going to ram you, and you'll have to take risks to get rid of them (not just ""don't crash""). You can see that they're programmed to make the chase fun, forcing you to react and think of ways to taking them out, (which is not no longer a fancy dressing on a cake, it's required.) If you like challenging cops, this is going to be fun. I'm still expecting the difficulty to increase as people learn that you cant just get away by driving in a straight line. you know, the same people who ask Is it realistic? no, you aren't probably ever going to get away from realistic cops.If you are finding it too hard, you probably aren't voice chatting enough.The Missions are actually fun and challenging, there is enough substance in the car handling to make different skill challenges enjoyable, and the reward of making your car a bit faster after every race is great. Those crash missions are great fun, you have to plan and execute crashes giving a nice buildup to a climatic crash.I hate catchup bonuses, But I'm going to make this an exception, It's right for the type of game it is.>MMOIt's the best way to halt the piracy of the game, This was going to happen sooner or later, and this is a really good first step for racing games.For an MMO, this is really well designed, I'm surprised at the MMO elements that they've got working nicely in the game, (like the RNG god) They're missing like, crafting, (Player designed parts? *wink wink*) but that's ok. but The game is well designed with so much to do for every type of gamer in the bartle test. I've found myself navigating a rocky offroad mountian climb with my friend, pushing him when he's stuck, and screaming when i was so close to getting over that rock before tumbling down. The open world is done right.You're all worring about the cash aspect? I feel what they're doing now is perfect, Yes cash helps you get stuff, but to get the end game gear, you gotta get your hands dirty grinding the RNG god for platinum parts. so yeah, money will give you access to some cars, but any car can be tuned to the same performance tier, This is probably the correct pay model, It respects customers enough to not be pay to win, I hope activision keeps it that way.The game is much more enjoyable with people to talk to, It's really how it's designed.The drawback is there's only half a dozen people in your session, so it's sort of an mmo with very small servers. But let's be honest, 1-- players infront of the HQ isn't driveable, especially with how much you guys care about traffic laws. )and the number will probably increase after launch day fad is over when the server is more free""It's not free of glitches, but to be honest i'm surprised at how well it's working for a game a couple days from launch day? I'm starting to hate Activision a little less, just for publishing this.>SoundI mentioned to my team time after time how good the Dodge Viper sounds, what pisses me off is the music, But luckly i'm on a PC, so I can just play whatever I want in the background. The sound's what it needs to be.Tips> (Tl:dr version)- Any car can finish the game- get a crew and voice chat outside of game- accept that this isn't ""realistic"" like F1, GT, and Forza- prepate a written a list of insults for the police- expect some disconnects and patches near launch date- Don't tune a 2nd car until you get 40, then buy the most expensive kit starter.- Best way to farm for money is PvP, don't grind jumps like I did.- Don't try to gold stuff unless you are stuck at a level, Platinum parts unlock at lv50.- Your mother is a nice person, okay? now stop crashing me out in PvP.

												In this particular piece of ""Car game"" style, you find yourself working for the special task force behind some bad apples inside the FBI. As younger brother of the leader of the 510 gang ""mi life be like uhhhh aaaahhh (everyone remember the song from fast and furious right), you just saw him be killed right after the drop on a meeting under a brigde( only he dosen't fell like a trap). U got planted, got locked up for 5 years and now, you're back on the street. Leveling up your rides for almost type of terrain out there, you progress as passing to a variety of challenges and side missions, besides the quest line missions itself.Watch out for other runner yet, they still on the ""Crash course"" when running against or cruising the cities (a shame indeed).

												This is one of the best games I have ever played. The fun that this game has swept me off my feet. The multiplayer is fantastic and same with singleplayer. I had expected this game to be a bit jaggedy at release but it has been the smoothest release I have seen. As of this reveiw I have played 15 hours in 3 days after it's release. This is coming from someone that is constantly very busy, I would stay up late and wake up early to find time to play this. I love the racing dynamics and graphics. The map is giant and beautiful and the detail in every city (except Santa Fe?). I love the fast travel and train/plane traveling. It is so much easier then driving forever to get somewhere because the map is so freaking big! This game is a must buy not for just racing lovers but to anyone with a PC.10/10			",59,4,7,1,10,2,1

												-Short and Sweet-If you know what your buying, did your research and understand its an MMO-R-RPG, with future free updates and DLC, Know what it is: Arcade-ish, Horizontal progression, minor vertical progression, open-world. Know what it is not: Not realistic racer, no massive important story, a game thats been out for a long time. Side notes: the BS thats being said about fixing up your cars, complete BS, Every spec, every car has its own style and body parts, i havent seen a clone of my skyline yet. Also iv been helped out by lvl 50's many times, just my Quick Cooping, iv made friends and raced on open streets for no good reason. Story missions done with rando's then friend requested. The car parts are like MMO's loot systems, you gotta complete something to get the upgrade part.Theres a lot of BS comments revolving around this game.The game is what you make it. Thats why its called Open-World. Also if you notice, some of the reviewers that talked ♥♥♥♥ on the game, still play it, GG.			",87,9,2,11,3,0,2

If you finish the story line you're stuck re-racing stuff you've already done with the only object of maxing the stats of each of your cars.  I don't really have an interest in PvP.

												Let me just say, the animators at Ivory Tower really pulled it off. This game is full of any form of racing action: time trials, races, takedowns, chases etc. It has an unravelling plot design, and a huge plot twist waiting for players. In depth missions and public events so you can meet new people and recruit them to your ""Crew"". Full customization of your car in different specs, or classifications, of vehicles.  The only problems I came across while playing was that the physics could be a little off. Overall, it was an incredible game and any fans of racing games will fall in love.			",17,3,0,0,0,0,0

												No one is going to read my review anyways so I will be totally brief...THAT GAME IS JUST AMAAAZING!IMO, it is the BEST modern arcade rading game! (I don't really like the modern arcade racing games, so I kept playing Need for Speed Most Wanted 2005 till pretty much 2 years ago LOL)Yes, it does have A FEW downsizes (by the way, if you are going to complain about the physics, be a man and just change it to hardcore. The ""easy"" mode from the Crew is not very satisfying tbh)One of the few horrible things with The Crew is the post mission HUD. It is just so stupid to have to wait many seconds on a screen about a challenge (mainly if you are under a police pursuit) just to find out you earned 250B. We should be able to just bash Enter/A(for controller) and go quickly through the menu.Aaand one thing that drives me mad are the police pursuits. Sometimes if you hit the rear of a police car, you just get stuck (you cant even reverse, the game bugs. Sometimes that happens even at stationary cars when you are NOT the most wanted) and that you cant just turn around and reverse during a pursuit without being arrested. ",69,4,7,8,8,0,9

												I genuinely like the crew as long as you make sure you purchase Wild Run this dramatically improves vehicle handling and adds motorbikes and monstertrucks to the mix as well as dynamic weather and visual improvements. The map scale is truely impressive and the car models are of very high quality making ownership of these cars a real joy to cruise around in. The sigleplayer Story expeience is always down to the wire with nailbiting races and the AI can screw up although not as much as a human will.The Multiplayer option is good and encourages competition as well as working together to finish that hard as balls mission.The in vehicle views and bonet views are very well done and add to the immersion.If I had anything negative to say it would be about inapp-purchases. NO Ubisoft NO. I want to be able to earn my vehicle and drive against players that have earned their new rides instead of people who can just buy the best vehicle and get all the advantages from that.PROS : Graphically stunning as long as you have Wild Run. Incredible scale and detail to the map it truly is MASSIVE! Vehicle Models are of the highest quality. A genuinely fun and exciting story fo the campaign (although generic)AI vehicles can screw up making it more realistic. CONS:INAPP-PURCHASES gives some players unfair advantage over a player who earns their vehicle in game . I don't expect to pay any more when Iv'e supposedly bought the whole game.

												Amazing game. My opinion is that is one of the world's most underrated games ever. It runs great, the cars look great. If you think the steering is too slow just adjust your sensitivity. I've travelled a lot, bought a lot of cars and now bikes. It is awesome to buy the Wild Run DLC. It is worth every penny, I simply love the game. The pvp events are nice, and the map is just amazingly huge. LOVE IT!			",27,0,0,0,2,0,0

												First of all, Use Voice chat, vent, skype TS, whatever, just communicate with people. Probably one of the best arcade racer I've ever experienced. that's something.Let's get something straight. Arcade racers are racing games that have selective physics to allow fun things to happen.If you are like me, someone who clocked 1000+ hours into Gran Turismo, played every racing game from F-Zero,CTR,Top gear,F1 simulators, to Racing lagoon. you don't expect anything to ever blow your mind again.Heck, after NFS after NFS, I started to believe arcade racers have nothing to deliver.This proved me wrong. Fantastically crafted balance of doing what's expected of a racing game, and taking itself seriously without being pretentious. > PhysicsThe physics are well crafted to do what it's supposed to, The hitboxes are somewhat forgiving as they will let you scrape past a crash or dodge trees from time to time, (unlike Forza where entering a corner wrong is kinda...fatal) It doesn't make you OCD about keeping your car in control like GT, and is both a relaxing and exciting experience.> VisualsIf you have a good PC, the visuals are quite decent, the topper is the cinematic value of an active racetrack. The game is light and easy enough for you to enjoy the cranes and planes, and steam leaks, strategically placed to block you from seeing stuff ahead is a nice touch.> StoryThe storyline? I didn't care for it at first, but it started to get better, unexpectedly good for something so cliche and dead on hollywood scriptwriting theories, The characters have a lot of depth for a racing game. It demonstrates there's nothing wrong with cliches, if it's done right. The end feels fulfilling and I'd totally get DLC for some of the character side storiesThe game is meant to be played together, the story is written so you can talk ♥♥♥♥ about it. It's not groundbreaking but it does the job right, something I haven't seen in racing games in a long time.(Willing suspension of disbelief regarding ""driving fixes problems"" is required. though much less than a michael bay movie)> GameplayIt's broken the line of pathetic cops game after game, where you can just ""go vroom vroom really fast"" and get away. It's a fantastic breath of fresh air. The cops actually do something. They will stop you if you drive stupidly behind them, you react to their radio as it gives you clues when they're going to ram you, and you'll have to take risks to get rid of them (not just ""don't crash""). You can see that they're programmed to make the chase fun, forcing you to react and think of ways to taking them out, (which is not no longer a fancy dressing on a cake, it's required.) If you like challenging cops, this is going to be fun. I'm still expecting the difficulty to increase as people learn that you cant just get away by driving in a straight line. you know, the same people who ask Is it realistic? no, you aren't probably ever going to get away from realistic cops.If you are finding it too hard, you probably aren't voice chatting enough.The Missions are actually fun and challenging, there is enough substance in the car handling to make different skill challenges enjoyable, and the reward of making your car a bit faster after every race is great. Those crash missions are great fun, you have to plan and execute crashes giving a nice buildup to a climatic crash.I hate catchup bonuses, But I'm going to make this an exception, It's right for the type of game it is.>MMOIt's the best way to halt the piracy of the game, This was going to happen sooner or later, and this is a really good first step for racing games.For an MMO, this is really well designed, I'm surprised at the MMO elements that they've got working nicely in the game, (like the RNG god) They're missing like, crafting, (Player designed parts? *wink wink*) but that's ok. but The game is well designed with so much to do for every type of gamer in the bartle test. I've found myself navigating a rocky offroad mountian climb with my friend, pushing him when he's stuck, and screaming when i was so close to getting over that rock before tumbling down. The open world is done right.You're all worring about the cash aspect? I feel what they're doing now is perfect, Yes cash helps you get stuff, but to get the end game gear, you gotta get your hands dirty grinding the RNG god for platinum parts. so yeah, money will give you access to some cars, but any car can be tuned to the same performance tier, This is probably the correct pay model, It respects customers enough to not be pay to win, I hope activision keeps it that way.The game is much more enjoyable with people to talk to, It's really how it's designed.The drawback is there's only half a dozen people in your session, so it's sort of an mmo with very small servers. But let's be honest, 1-- players infront of the HQ isn't driveable, especially with how much you guys care about traffic laws. )and the number will probably increase after launch day fad is over when the server is more free""It's not free of glitches, but to be honest i'm surprised at how well it's working for a game a couple days from launch day? I'm starting to hate Activision a little less, just for publishing this.>SoundI mentioned to my team time after time how good the Dodge Viper sounds, what pisses me off is the music, But luckly i'm on a PC, so I can just play whatever I want in the background. The sound's what it needs to be.Tips> (Tl:dr version)- Any car can finish the game- get a crew and voice chat outside of game- accept that this isn't ""realistic"" like F1, GT, and Forza- prepate a written a list of insults for the police- expect some disconnects and patches near launch date- Don't tune a 2nd car until you get 40, then buy the most expensive kit starter.- Best way to farm for money is PvP, don't grind jumps like I did.- Don't try to gold stuff unless you are stuck at a level, Platinum parts unlock at lv50.- Your mother is a nice person, okay? now stop crashing me out in PvP.

Leveling up your rides for almost type of terrain out there, you progress as passing to a variety of challenges and side missions, besides the quest line missions itself.Watch out for other runner yet, they still on the ""Crash course"" when running against or cruising the cities (a shame indeed).

												This is one of the best games I have ever played. The fun that this game has swept me off my feet. The multiplayer is fantastic and same with singleplayer. I had expected this game to be a bit jaggedy at release but it has been the smoothest release I have seen. As of this reveiw I have played 15 hours in 3 days after it's release. This is coming from someone that is constantly very busy, I would stay up late and wake up early to find time to play this. I love the racing dynamics and graphics. The map is giant and beautiful and the detail in every city (except Santa Fe?). I love the fast travel and train/plane traveling. It is so much easier then driving forever to get somewhere because the map is so freaking big! This game is a must buy not for just racing lovers but to anyone with a PC.10/10			",59,4,7,1,10,2,1

												I would recommend this game for the driving, seamless map integration, various skill objectives and missions, and all around car tuning and handling.I would not recommend this game for its useless PVP system, its repetitive grind, no end-game benefits, its censorship, the absurd story, or its custom car designs and micro-transaction model.Overall, if you enjoy racing games and play them often, this game ranks up there with some of the greats. But, on the down side, there is no inclination of ultimate purpose other than to repeat what you have already done in the past. Not having a beneficial PVP or Faction vs. Faction system takes away one of the main key factors that would keep you playing this game, rewards. There is simply no motivating factors in the game that would make you stockpile vehicles or outdo yourself on the skills circuit, unless you have absolutely no life or are a completionist.6/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is going to be very long, but I am very passionate about this. Long story short, I do not think this game is worth $60+ I would consider it closer to a $30-$40 game. Very stable, especially for Ubisoft, and I enjoyed myself.When this game was first announced at E3, I was so excited. It appeared to be close to the game I'd been hoping for years ago. I have always been a fan of racing games, and over the last few years I've been underwhelmed by the options on PC. I was quick to pre-order The Crew despite my displeasure with Ubisoft and Watch_Dogs especially. When I played the Beta for The Crew, I was met with a stable game which was nice, but there were little things that bothered me. First and foremost was their approach to many of the landmarks of the US. I live in Las Vegas, so once I finally got there, I was underwhelmed. I feel like GTA San Andreas had a better looking Vegas than this game does. I then noticed that Mazda Laguna Seca was on the map also. Laguna Seca is one of my favorite Tracks ever, so I had to see it. After my initial woes with Las Vegas, I was mildly worried. My fears came true, and this point I was legitamately upset.  If you are going to take the time to put a track as Iconic as Laguna Seca in the game, at least do it justice. The Corkscrew, a sweeping S curve, with a 3 story drop, is flat in the game. plus the bump just before the corner turns into a jump at any speed greater than about 50 mph. I understand they can't capture every single part of the US but for tracks, especially those like Laguna Seca, at least make them like the real thing. Car selection is very limited comapred to most other racing titles, but you can go through the entire game with your starter car. there really is no need to spend money at all. I beat the game only spending 2200 on mirrors for my Ferrari, because the Italian flag decal didn't really fit withthe rest of the car. All class upgrades are paid for and individula parts are awarded from skill challenges. unless you want to drive a different car, or make the ones you have prettier, there is absolutely no need to buy anything. I am not very ggod at games in general so I found some missions to be very frustrating. The takedown missions in particular were an annoyance for me. trying to chase someone down and inflict enough damage was very difficult for me. As were the Smash missions, hit a certain number of container within the time limit. it would take me over an hour just for those missions, mostly due to physics (more on that later). The story was pretty much what you would expect from a racing game. Not super indepth, lots of random missions that you have to do with no real explanation of why, but it does have a rather logical progression, and moves at a decent pace. I played through the entire campaign solo, and the only time i interacted with other players was occasionally having a head on collision mid corner. now that I beat the story I might look more into Faction missions, but for now, I found the online function to be more of an annoyance than anything useful.  Overall, I would say that from a game play standpoint, I wasn't really disappointed.  From a technological stand point I was.... I'll say satisfied. In 24.6 hours of play the game only crashed 3 times. As far as servers go, the only time I had trouble connecting was when they were performing server maintanence. Visually, this is actually a very good looking game. If it weren't for the 60 fps lock, and the strange Depth of Field effects I wouldn't have any complaints. Honestly, playing at max settings (motion blur and depth of field off) I was playing at 3140 x 2160 on my  GTX 980 at a stable 60 fps, and gpu usage was only at around 70%. I would have liked to be able to fully utilize 144 Hz that my monitor is capable of, but for whatever reason they locked it to 60. Not a deal breaker for the vast majority of consumers, but it was mildly irksome for me. Normal road driving is quite satisfying, once I turned driving assists to hardcore, I was quite content with the handling. The collision detection baffles me though. there is no consistency as far as what constitutes a full crash and what is just a glancing blow. I had times that I would ram into the back of a pedestrian vehicle by more than half of it, and my car would just ""glitch"" to one side and I wouldn't lose more than a couple mph. other times there would be a couple of feet between my car and the pedestrian vehicle, and I would crash. I tried to figure out why, but never really could. The most ridiculous aspect of the physics is most apparent once you unlock the raid class. These vehicles are designed to go offroad, over large objects, and jumps. Every time I tried to go off a jump, the physics would react in a way that I can only call alien.  I could get practically no distance, or I would have insane nose up manuvers. worst of all was the tendency for the car to spring up to one side if only one tire went over a large rock or object. If your vehicle goes past a 90 degree angle the game treats it as a crash, even if you end up landing on your wheels again. If you did end up making it off the jump well, the game trys to keep you flat, most of the time, so more times than not I would end up taking an awkward bounce and spin out. This was completely unnatural to me. and it was so random I couldn't compensate for it. If the game was trictly on road, this wouldn't be a problem, but there are so many missions, like the smash missions I mentioned before, where this comes into play, and it is very frustrating. At the end of the day, I was able to work around these issues, and beat the missions, but I could never really achieve the score I wanted because the physics would mess me up. But i do have to give them credit, not once did i experience a glitch, much less a game breaking one. Just 3 freeze and crashes that I can't really explain, but since it is always online, server based, I didn't lose any progress.Overall I would give The Crew a 7 out of 10. It held my attention the whole time, and I found satisfaction in completeing missions. the overall experience was quite good, it had it's faults, but nothing was ever major enough to put me off of the game entirely. I would say wait for it so go on sale for 33% or more, and you'll get your moneys worth. For that reason, I do recommend  this game.			",295,55,26,27,26,2,15

												I have literally never given a review for all the games I have ever played in my 23 years of living, last year I got into PC gaming. I purchased a g27 Logitech steering wheel and have been playing racing games mainly since then. To satisfy my ""free roam/buy cars"" itch I had been playing Test Drive Unlimited 2. Awesome graphics, Fun enough gameplay and hours of me crusing around Hawaii drinking beer and driving XD.I have read a HORRENDOUS amount of negative reviews about this game and since it was able to be played last night I havn't put it down, I dont know why it says 8.5 hours played. For one, the driving feels exactly the way I want a game like this to feel, I play other racing sims such at Assetto Corsa, WRC3, RBR and I will tell you, i would NOT want The Crew to play like that. WAY more fun being able to fly 120mph in an over powered 370z around corners and flying off rediculously over sized ramps (on the fly challenges are F***ING cool, you'll learn when you start playing) than it being on the ""Realistic/Simulator"" side. I mean seriously in those games you have to actually drop it to about 15mph around a sharp turn to keep your car in control. Do you REALLY want to be doing that in a NFS style game? No, it would get highly annoying.To those of you with a g27. This game works perfectly with it, 900* of rotation feels just right. Plently of tweaking options to make all your pedals feel just right, Force Feedback kicks just right with what your car is doing.There is alot more, just message me or comment for more questions.Must buy, 10/10, BAD A**.

												I've played this game for 3 hours total, i cannot say i have anything to complain about in the way the map system and cars look and so forth. But anyway, pro's and con's.Con's:- controlling of cars aren't as good as i expected when i bought the game. - At points, not occuring too often, the game freezez like a glitch or loads forever which ends up in me restarting the game. - Too good graphics, (shouldn't complain, but not having a high end pc is taking it's toll on me, and in the position i am in right now, i can't upgrade my pc. Therefore i wish the game had more ""modifiable"" graphics where i can choose what the graphics card focuses mostly on. Such as for example, car quality over cloud/sunray quality (For example).- I do feel like it's not a super great racing game, where as i got my hopes up while watching trailers and such. Pro's:-Game looks amazing-Great details on car, great details on to be honest, anything graphic wise. - Very ""rookie"" friendly, i believe anyone could enjoy this gameIn general, i do very much recommend this game if they fix the cars driving and drifting control. (More like GTA V) If you got a high-end pc, and you enjoy games with amazing graphics, this is definitely to recommend! :) Based on skills with driving games and such:  Experience Recommended?   Noob Sure, try the Demo   Experienced Yep, try the version without DLC's and such   Pro Yes definitely, just buy the whole kit, won't regret it.  ",50,2,0,9,1,0,2

												Okay here I am, two years after the game got released. And having bought the Gold edition, and now CAU with WR it wasn't the cheapest thing here. Hell I might have bough a ship in Star Citizen instead of this. But this game has given me Many hours of relaxation. If we are talking about PVP even some frustration. If you want an open world racing game, get this, but I'd wait for a sale, since it's crazy buying it for the full price with the DLC's, it's important to say that you are good to go with the standard version, altough CAU brings some sweet Police vehicles.But hey first I'll tell you what you will completely love about this game.The world, it's just so huge that I can't stop loving it. I always wanted a racing game where instead of just running around tracks, you could just set a course and go that way. And these guys finally did it. I've driven aimlessly for about 500km's (real). And then another 500 km's with set destinations (without any purpose)And another 300km's when I had to get somewhere.So that's the open world done.Racing SP - AI is weird and stupid. But it can be quite enjoyable to try and stay in the perfect line on the current track. Singleplayer racing is more used for grinding money.Racing MP - I don't like it. It's just exploiting the games arcade drive model. So instead of real driving action you are just sliding and doing unrealistic stuff all the time.The Summit - You do some stuff from time to time to increase your chance to get a vehicle for free, nothing extra.CAU pursuits - Feel extremely weird... You have two abilities, as racer and even as a cop. They slightly are slightly different from each other, but extremely OP. Just press one button each 40s to literally stop each and everys cop atempt to stop you, cop players end up just resetting to the transporter to get emp'ed again... Cops are in a huge disadvantage, if you are Dark Souls kind of player who just wants to die of frustration, suit yourself. For Racers it's a grinding quest, where occasionally you get intercepted by a cop player, and just follow two simple rules 1) head for the destination 2) Press any of your abilities when ready and cop players are nearby to ruin their day and secure yourself that you get the money to buy another car to do the same thing again to buy another car and so on.Vehicles - Another thing that I love about this game is the amount of cars. They might not represent their real life counterparts. But hey, they are not completely same cars. You get European supercars, classics, sportscars, American Muscle cars and Japanese tuners. If you have a favorite car, it is probably there.Customization is also fine, most of the time you get about 8 bumper variations, hoods. Wings, rims. Hell of a lot of colors and stickers. To make your favorite car appeal to you even more.Also I really love the added police vehicles. Nothing says security more then a cop driving 360km/h in a police Lamborghini Gallardo SVVerdict - This game is just great for wandering off just like you do for instance in Skyrim.Unfortunately you can see throughout the game that the energy to develop this game went into the wrong aspects. I personally think that Ivory Tower should've gone into the RP style of gameplay, similar to Test Drive Unlimited. They focus too much on ""your"" Crew, that is just a normal group like in WoW or any other MMORPG.But if it is in sale, and you crave for a driving game with vast open world and a variety of vehicles.

												In overall its a very good game. It kinda feels like a Gta but only for cars. Heres some points that could be improved:- Add more cars- More modifications- The cops are overpower, especially when they chase you. What I mean by that is even if you got a 600 hp car they can catch up to you. Its impossible to ram them or put them out of ''service''- Fix the textures of building and stuff like that, it feels a little bit ''cheap'' compared to the cars graphics.- Add more civils and cars on the road.- Theres one thing I think is ridiculous is that you pass a cop at 300 miles/hour and they don't go after you but when you break a fence they chase the ♥♥♥♥ out of you.- Improve the AI intelligence.- Have been having this issue during the cinematic. I don't have any sounds.- There sould be some kind of heist that you could do. Like chasing after a armored truck to steel the money. Stuff like that.like I said its a very good game, it only needs some improvements. It has some potential.8,5/10 would keep playing.PS: sorry for my bad english at some points.			",69,3,0,2,1,0,2

												The first game that i really didn't regret buying, it's the only game that takes me back through timeon my NFS: U days but 50x bettermy game rating: 9/10Pros:- Customizable Cars- Street, Dirt, Performance, Raid, Circuit (NFS, Dirt, NFS Shift)- Open map ( The whole USA, it's just mindblowing )- No Loading screens when on the road, ( roads just keep going and going and going)- Landmarks ( i really love this, i'm learning new places in the game, featuring SALT FLATS! Even NASA rockets)- Long roads, stuffs are never ending, when you check the map it's filled with races waiting for you- the whole USA can be fitted on a 15-17GB game- nicely optimized, even the low settings look nice and runs in my laptop- has a story line- The Season pass cars are just WOW- replayable- The developers are active and listening to the community (forums)Betweeners:- few cars selection (FOR NOW, i know more cars are coming)- The concept of the ""crew"" is not really implemented strongly in-game- some server issues (FOR NOW, cuz i know they're still ironing the server side, hello it's still the 4th day of the game)- MMO is based on sessions, (you really don't see ALL the players online)- Somewhat short story line- Easy to reach max levelCONS:- The Cops- AI has obvious rubberbanding- The chat interface has litteraly no use (i can chat easier on steam/uplay chat)- Uplay-  no character customization- The radiowishes:- Photo App- More cars- Drift Spec- More organized rims- rim colors- remove spoilers- tire profiles and ride height- Specs for ALL cars			",15,0,1,1,3,0,0

												This game is great if you like racing games. It has many different cars to chose from and they all have ways of customizing them. You can drive across America. it takes an hour of driving to get from coast to coast(havent done this myself but I read that on reddit.) The beginning of the game has a lot of racing, but you can just drive and explore around the country if you want to. Its a lot of fun with friends, but its not required. There's a lot of stuff to do. it currently has a few bugs and the occasional server issue because of how recently it came out. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												With some initial rocky troubles with updates and stability, this game had me swinging from exhilarated to furious and back to exhilarated again.  Right now everything is working fine and its the best damn driving game i've played.I've been a major fan of the Need for Speed series, especially the free roaming, free agent types of Most Wanted and Hot Pursuit.  With those previous titles, they pioneered many features of free driving and competitive co-operative play i've enjoyed.  With The Crew, I get to experience all of that with added elements of full co-operative support, an unprecidentedly open free roam world, well balanced cosmetic and performance modifications.  I'm still getting into the game so i'm still looking forward to the real PvE and PvP experiences along with the action the faction system will bring.For now it definitely gets a thumbs up, though as with any launch title it will have bugs and problems, so be patient (or wait a while before you buy).

Long freeways/highways for showing off how fast your cars can actually go, and nice city streets for smaller races/drifting. The only problems i have with this game are that 1.

												+Decent handling, Little too stiff for my liking, but it does the job.tons of interesting / unique environments / tracks to race inStory mode has good variety in gameplay (story mode lasts about 6 hours)can literally instantly warp to any location/event on the map (assuming you've driven to the area before)You and your friends can be in the same party while still playing different events or be at different locations.Grouping / playing with friends is super easy.Awesome, easy to use menus / interfaces-to have any chance at winning multiplayer matches, you'll need to grind a lot to upgrade your car (which can only done in solo-mode). If you don't improve your car level, you'll lose the race so bad you won't even see your oponent for 90% of the race.This means you will basically NEED to spend 6+ hours (on top of completing the story mode) trying to improve your cars doing repetitive tasks (hit the targets, drive as fast as possible, jump as far as possible, etc) until your cars are leveeld up) just to enjoy multiplayer races. These events, after the first few 3-4 times lose their fun value quick.I really dislike the car leveling system (at least as far as the multiplayer is concerned) and it's for this reason, I haven't had a chance to enjoy multiplayer and probably never will (I refuse to play X hours completing mundane tasks just as a prerequisite to compete against others in multiplayer.)All-in-all, it's a great game, especaially if you're into arcade racing. They really setup a nice framework and allow a lot of flexibility to encourage people to play in groups. If you hope to race against others in multiplayer, be prepared to do 6+ hours of grinding first.			",173,7,12,10,5,1,9

												Ubisoft has created a new genre of racing game, it's neither arcade or realism, it's Ubisoft genre which is really, really bad.This game is one of the worse racing games I've ever played.The cops are like walls of brick.I finished a quick activity where i needed to drive through the arrows and a cop was after me, it shouldn't since i was in an activity but oh well i end up the activity and now i can't to anything cause a window appear to show me my score and right after i was gonna click on something so I could retry it I got bursted... What the heck is that?There are many flaws other than that but In my opinion, that is the worse of them.It is an MMO but why is the connection always required? That's ********, In 1, 2 or 3 years, when the servers will close, what we'll do? Lost 100$ for a game that is not even worth 2$ that we won't even be able to play anymore?I'm not pre-purchasing games from Ubisoft anymore, I got my lesson, thanks Ubisoft and congratulations.Seriously, If I could get a refund I would ask for a refund right now.Now I'm stuck with an horrible game to finish.I thought that this game would be so great, I'm really disappointed to be honest.It could have been a really great game.2/10 (I can't give it more than 2, I'm not even sure if it does deserve 2 to be honest).The 6/10 review is way too good, a 6/10 game is a under-average game and this game is far but really far away from that.Facts are facts.This game is crap, it's not a simulation, do not believe those idiotic morons who says that this game feels like a simulation one, it's pure arcade, the problem is not that this is an arcade game, the problem is a that it is a really, but really bad arcade game.It feels like a Pay2Win game (or spend a lot, but a lot of time grinding for crap) that I have paid 110$ for.Of course I'm done pre-purchasing games, from any developers, developers and publishers are cancer nowadays, the only game I am glad I pre-purchased even If i didn't not play it alot back then, was the Witcher 3 because it has content, the price was okay and it doesn't have crappy greedy ""we're too incompetent and brainless, we need your money, feed us with your money, we're w**res"" microtransactions.People who pre-purchased the game (such as me, not pre-ordering any Ubisoft or EA Games never again, never did with Activision, Treyarch and Infinity Ward) paid 110$ for this piece of trash that required you to be online 24/7 if you want to play, the season pass is not worth **** and the game is made by a bunch of pathetic incompetents, we barely got any content and we have to pay for crappy ""expansions"" that should be in the season pass since we got barely anything off it.We paid 40$+ for a few cars... Okay? And we have to pay for the crappy expansions wannabe that should have been in the season pass in the first place?Damn it Ubisoft, you're worse than I thought, you have no limit to your dumbness, pathetic greedness, you are easily in the top of the worse developers ever, probably worse kind of human too? You don't kill innocent people, that's it, at least, that's a start but you ♥♥♥♥ them up with such bullcrap. And you except us to buy more of your games?Right, even some brainless dudes can dream I guess.Like always, they're lying, they says that there's more than 100 cars on this game but there is NOT, it's just different variations (dirt, street, raid, etc). You can't say that there's more than 100 vehicles, that's just bu**sh** and you know it, one lie after another, Ubisoft are the best at it.The driving is horrible, the handling is horrible.The physics are simply horrible, the physics were better in many 2000 racing games than in this one for fu**'s sake.Microtransactions on a 110$ game.The cops catch you way too fast (you stop for a second and you are already under arrested, that is not realistic at all).After finishing a challenge, It brings a screen with your score and stuff but if you have cops after you then you'll get arrested and you can not do anything about it.They sell DLCs that should come free with the game, let's be honest, anyone with gray matter and who know how a computer works can make meshes and textures, animations are more complicated but if you spend the time learning, you'll be able to do something way better than what those morons at Ubisoft did.There's not many vehicles and they all feel the same but with different speed.Microtransactions on a 110$ game.Now they sell an expansion that people who bought the season pass should have for free.I could say a lot more but I'll stop here, well done Ubisoft, well done, you are seriously pathetic and your name is the definition of ""greed"" and ""incompetent"".Wait, did I said that this game has mother♥♥♥♥ing transactions? Because there is.In my case, he only reason to keep playing this game, It's because I paid 110$ for this crap so better make it worth it even if the game is in all honesty, sh**.And it will probably be too late in a few years when they will close the servers, will they add a offline mode? Seriously, I doubt it, we're talking about Ubisoft after all, a bunch of brainless, worse than headless chickens, ****oles.I'm always straight when it comes to facts.Save yourself some money and do not buy this game, they're probably going to close the servers way before 2018 and they probably won't even add an offline mode, if they do, then I'll be impressed and they'll deserve an award for being somehow competent.This game should be free to play, seriously, just stay away from it.The question would be... Which one is the worse? EA Games, Ubisoft or Activision/Treyarch/Infinity Ward?This question is giving me a headache...And now most of the developers follows them.Where is all of this going? I love video games, I really do but it should just stop, no more producing, or at least, not from incompetents such as those, it should be illegal for them to make any games.Sorry not sorry if you love Ubisoft, it's all about the facts, I don't know how you can like them after all what they've done, perhaps 19 years ago, when they started but not today, they're just bad.Are there even bots in this game? That roams freely like in Test Drive? All I see is humans, sometimes, there are like two players, no bots.I don't know if this game has bots or not but it doesn't seems like it, which would be pretty stupid since a way older game has them and they were pretty good, sometimes, you thought they were humans.Seriously, just go play Test Drive Unlimited, it's a way better game, it may have a few flaws and not the best handling ever but does this game even has a good handling? Not at all, not even average.Heck, even Test Drive Unlimited 2 is better than this.I'll be waiting for my offline mode with bots, If i don't get them, you can be sure I won't be buying any of your games ever again Ubishit.

												This game was quite a letdown, to be honest.The physics are awful, every car handles like it is front-wheel-drive, any collision will send you into either a cutscene, or will shove you into oblivion, Traffic will spawn randomly causing more collisions and annoying cutscenes,The story is flimsy at best,Objectives are repetitive,Map is large, but sparsely populated with cities, and the cities that do exist in game are much smaller than they should be.Police chases lack any real substance (all they do is follow)Lack of carsLack of customizationThe customization that the game does include feels like it came straight out of F&F The Crew almost feels like it should have been released about 10 years ago with NFS: Most Wanted, because that is exactly what this game reminds me of.

												I like the ideea of the game and where it's heading, but i don't like that I had to pay that much for the basic game version and then I would have to pay more for the cars and upgrades!

												Do not buy this unless it's on a sale. Unless you have people to play with, don't buy it at all. Plus, the game has ♥♥♥♥ed Anti-Aliasing so even an OCd 960 with 4GB of VRAM can't run this at over 60FPS if the AA is cranked all the way up. A 960 is light years better than a GTX 580 (The recommended GPU) and it still can't max the game at an acceptable framerate. Also, after finishing the story, unless you want to go into PvP, you have nothing to do apart from roam around looking at the landscape. Which doesn't sound bad for a game like this but believe me. You get ♥♥♥♥ing tired of just driving around doing nothing pretty quick. The story is really damn fun but if you put time into this game daily then that's over pretty quick. I just wish that this new expansion had added more story missions but nope. I bought this on sale for $35.99 CAD ($27.60 USD) and I feel ripped offTL;DR : Unless you have people to play with, don't buy this. Even on a sale. Little content. Gets very stale after finishing the story.			",67,11,9,2,2,1,2

												With this new update, ♥♥♥♥ man you guys have to fix a LOT, seriously.- The race guilde line. ( the ones that tells you where to go and when to hit the brakes or gas ) is completely broken, it was never that fantastic, but it was playable, but now it constantly tells you you're off track or the line just completely dissappears. example: I was just playing a faction race in the south, one of more than 1 hour long ( according to the game... ) and after every check point the line dissappears after about half a mile after you hit the checkpoint, you're better off without than with the raceline.- Setback to track. djeezes, that one is one of the worst things there is to complain about rn. IT BLOODY SET'S YOU BACK TO THE PREVIOUS CHECKPOINT INSTEAD OF JUST BACK ON THE TRACK. During my faction race in the south there I had lead of more than 1 minute, they were more than 4 or 5 miles behind me, I crash into another car, I get reset, ♥♥♥♥ING HALF A MILE BEHIND THE CARS WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY 5 MILES BEHIND ME. and it didn't happend just once, happend multiple times. and now that I'm writing about setbacks, if you go off track for too long with a street, dirt, perf or circuit car and you wanna get a setback it sets you in the middle of where the ♥♥♥♥ you are, everywhere but on the road.- Guardrails. whenever you're going with a decent speed over the highway ( or any road ) and you end up sliding along a guardrail if you don't watch out it'll stop you at an instant. flip your car to the other side of a road or just crash your car completely. seriously? I lost soo many times because of this glitch. along with all the other ♥♥♥♥ed up stuff, look into it and fix it.I used to enjoy this game a LOT, played over 200 hours on it because I really did like this game, but not anymore, with the new update that went live couple of hours ago, there is soo much to fix, seriously. I like this update with the cop cars and stuff, but instead of being greedy to money and making a new dlc, focus more on glitches and bugs in the game. I do know you probably have a team working on that, but put more people on that team because with this update, you have a LOOOOT or work to do.			",89,8,1,9,6,0,2

												Recommended for %75+ discount price, for its base price it absolutely does not worth it! ( i also bought it on sale that is why i gave it a ""recommended"" )This review is from someone who is not a racing or sports fan at all but my all time favourite racing game which actually got me into trying some racing games is Need for Speed Most Wanted 2005:The Crew is a bit close to NFSMW 2005 since it has a story line + car tuning + cop chases + helicopter supports and different type of racing methods such as circuit or just a straight racing line or just like NFS 2005 time trials in addition it also has ""Raid"" and ""Dirt"" racing too which completely makes it different than other racing games. story line is not that good or amazing it is just there to help you progress faster and unlock more stuff before you jump into multiplayer so do not expect an amazing ending or something totally unique.Pros:- a complete racing game for those who want to experience every type of racing methods in one game.- handling the car can be really realistic if you put it on hardcore, unlike NFS it is much harder to handle the car here it is more realistic.- perks which can help you to finish the game easier.- good online compared to other UBI games this one is one of the few games which has a good online, COOP is really nice if you are stuck in a mission just find someone to do COOP with it is alot easier to pass the campaign missions in the COOP than solo.- huge map and a lot of different areas to test your car in.- different tones of online game modes which can be selected by voting before the match starts.Cons:- if you have a wireless gamepad your game detects it as driving wheel and therfore keys dont work properly at all.- sometimes you need to restart the game completley to avoid some minor bugs such as not showing a friend online or in your crew when they join you.- for a $60 game there is too much cut out contents being sold as DLC, for example the biggest joke is all Mercedes cars in this game are DLC none of them can be unlocked without paying real money which is a shame for a $60 game.- some missions are extremly stupidly designed specially the raid ones. they have no racing feeling at all and in some of them yu have to drive in middle of trees at night so you crash a lot and it is really really annoying.- not all cars can be tuned to what you want, the tuning is just a side option in this game it is not actually tuning like in NFS 2005, you have nearly no options for tuning your car except accepting what game forces you to buy for the missions.- finding a multiplayer match is so hard, first you need to search automatically for a game and as long as not enough players are found the lobby wont get started, when it does players have to vote for what type of game mode and race they wanna play, you can not select what game mode you want before searching so you exactly get what you want. you select what you want in the lobby and so do other players so if you are lucky you get what you want if not then you have to play what others want.- you can not test your favourite car in every race you want as most of the cars do not have much tuning options for Raid and Dirt. for example if your car is aston martin you can only play it in ""performance missions"" if a mission is dirt or street you have to use a street car and aston martin can not be tuned for any other race than ""performance"".- for a 2014 game i was expecting a lot better graphics for this game but sadly only cars are really detailed and well designed people and the city enviroment have the graphics of GTA back in 2000s. Cutscenes are nearly like a movie they are really detailed well designed and really high quality but game its self is absolutly awful for a 2014 game.- cop chases are really really stupid and they can be EASILY avoided. road blocks are a joke only one car in the road block and helicopter always runs out of fuel so fast and returns to base so you are safe from air recon. your car is 1000x times faster than police cars they never reach you and you can clearly see this in every escape mission you can avoid them under 20 seconds and win the mission. i personally never got arrested in this game by cops but in NFS 2005 i think at least 30000 times i was being arrested by cops.- crashing physics is really stupid and unreleastic somtimes. you can avoid a hard crash and sometimes by even a small scratch your car gets messed up, it is really random.

My attempts to make contact with the few other players i've seen have seen me following them around spamming ""can you see this"" and ""flash your lights if you see this"".

												There are some reasons to dislike 'The Crew' but one that makes the game a recommendation – it's fun.Pros:- Enormous map of the U.S.A.- Very interesting, long campaign, almost like a movie. IMO best story ever in a racing game. 65 Missions- Some extremely long races. 2.5 hours from Miami to Los Angeles via New York!!! (Perfect to turn your head off after a long day at the office)- Nice graphics (if you find the right settings)- Many ways to improve your cars.- Cars can be tuned into street, off-road, performance, race or rally cars. (some cars can only be tuned into some of the types)- Visual tuning- Performance tuning- Co-op missions- Cockpit view- Different radio stations- Country side looks fantastic (cities not always)- Total open world, also in all races- All cars feel different- Police (but too easy to escape)- Tons of mini games - All kind of animals, the crocodiles in the New Orleans swamps look fantastic- day/night cycle- addictiveCons:- Frame-rate sometimes drops, especially in cities. Changing graphic settings does not prevent this.- Car handling isn't the best in the beginning of the game but gets better after improving individual car settings - Very hard to make money, but you need money to buy cars. After 40 hours of playing I only have like 10 cars. There are about 50 cars in the game but you have to consider the different race-types (race, rally, etc.) So you can have like 200 different cars if you have the money. (not all cars support all types)- You can buy game money with real money :-(((- Some cars can only be bought with real money :-(((...but you do not need them to win in MP- Permanent on-line connection required- Game takes long to start- Upgrading cars is time consuming and can be frustrating. Every car can be upgraded to max level 1299. You need to play tests (hill climb, slalom, speed test, escape, etc.) to collect upgrade kits. But the game randomly decides which upgrade level you will receive. So even if you successfully complete the test you might not get the upgrade part you need. If you attempt to upgrade a car that already has a high level you can repeat tests like 50 times without being granted with the missing part, although you succeeded the test 50 times. Alternatively you can buy missing car parts but only if you have already earned the desired upgrade level and the fact that the game keeps you low on money makes upgrading by buying parts a painful decision.- MP race selection can be frustrating. Before each mp event every player can select their favorite event. Players can select the track, the car type and mp event type (racing, king of the crown, etc.). They can decide to activate or deactivate contact with other players and activate or deactivate traffic. A random selection carried out by the game will decide who's player selection will be played next.- High influence of luck in MP if you play with crash kids. You can lead 90% of a race but if someone pushes you into a field at 300 kph you're almost certain to become last. IMO it's best to select races with deactivated player contact but it's a matter of luck if you will play such race or not because the game decides which event is going to be played.- AI is too easy most of the time- Not a MMO. Eight simultaneous players in free drive mode- No rain, no snow, no weather conditions- Uplay- If Ubisoft servers are unavailable you can not play.- Sometimes mp players seem to cheat, but very rarely.'The Crew' is not a serious racing game like 'Dirt', 'Grid' or 'Project Cars'. It's an arcade fun racer in a cozy, feel good world that simply looks fantastic. The star of the game is the enormous and beautiful U.S.A. and the story.			",213,74,13,29,8,1,33

												Well this is the 2nd time i bought The Crew becuase EA delayed their NFS 2015 for PC, and i need to fullfill my Racing Game addiction so i bought this game again. Because this is the only decent Arcade Racer game yet on pc, and im sure when NFS out on PC it will knock the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game :DShort Review: Good Story and Large map to play with + BIKES!! , Lack of Cars + Bad car Costumization. So get this game only when it goes on Sale, i dont recommend you to buy it at full price,Now for Pros and Cons:+ Preety good story that can keep you playing for 1 week just for the stories. I say this because i have completed the story for 2nd time and it still enjoyable :D+ Large map you can travel across USA and it takes roughly 30-50 minutes to travel from Chicago to Miami. Imagine going from side to side :D Really fun for cruising around good scenery.+ Have diffrent kind of weather, like Rain, Snow, Thunderstorm, Sunny. If they add Tornadoes it would be so cool!+ Monster Trucks, Dragster and Drift spec, Lovin It!+ BIKES makes your game more easier to beat hahahaha+ Decent graphic after the Wild Run update.Now for the cons:- Bad costumization option.- Lack of Japanese car and some old European cars. Too much supercars here.- PVP not so good right now, but still enjoyable though.- Online feature in this game still kinda meh. Like Crew feature is kinda useless here which is they promised to #NeverDriveAlone but for me its #AlwaysDriveAlone.So you may ask ""Do you Recommend it?"" then My answer is, If you REALLY REALLY want to play an Arcade Racer then get this game. Becaus its currently the decent Arcade racer game you can get for PC right now, When NFS released i wont recommend you to get this game tho.			",32,0,2,3,1,1,0

												Recommended for %75+ discount price, for its base price it absolutely does not worth it! ( i also bought it on sale that is why i gave it a ""recommended"" )This review is from someone who is not a racing or sports fan at all but my all time favourite racing game which actually got me into trying some racing games is Need for Speed Most Wanted 2005:The Crew is a bit close to NFSMW 2005 since it has a story line + car tuning + cop chases + helicopter supports and different type of racing methods such as circuit or just a straight racing line or just like NFS 2005 time trials in addition it also has ""Raid"" and ""Dirt"" racing too which completely makes it different than other racing games. story line is not that good or amazing it is just there to help you progress faster and unlock more stuff before you jump into multiplayer so do not expect an amazing ending or something totally unique.Pros:- a complete racing game for those who want to experience every type of racing methods in one game.- handling the car can be really realistic if you put it on hardcore, unlike NFS it is much harder to handle the car here it is more realistic.- perks which can help you to finish the game easier.- good online compared to other UBI games this one is one of the few games which has a good online, COOP is really nice if you are stuck in a mission just find someone to do COOP with it is alot easier to pass the campaign missions in the COOP than solo.- huge map and a lot of different areas to test your car in.- different tones of online game modes which can be selected by voting before the match starts.Cons:- if you have a wireless gamepad your game detects it as driving wheel and therfore keys dont work properly at all.- sometimes you need to restart the game completley to avoid some minor bugs such as not showing a friend online or in your crew when they join you.- for a $60 game there is too much cut out contents being sold as DLC, for example the biggest joke is all Mercedes cars in this game are DLC none of them can be unlocked without paying real money which is a shame for a $60 game.- some missions are extremly stupidly designed specially the raid ones. they have no racing feeling at all and in some of them yu have to drive in middle of trees at night so you crash a lot and it is really really annoying.- not all cars can be tuned to what you want, the tuning is just a side option in this game it is not actually tuning like in NFS 2005, you have nearly no options for tuning your car except accepting what game forces you to buy for the missions.- finding a multiplayer match is so hard, first you need to search automatically for a game and as long as not enough players are found the lobby wont get started, when it does players have to vote for what type of game mode and race they wanna play, you can not select what game mode you want before searching so you exactly get what you want. you select what you want in the lobby and so do other players so if you are lucky you get what you want if not then you have to play what others want.- you can not test your favourite car in every race you want as most of the cars do not have much tuning options for Raid and Dirt. for example if your car is aston martin you can only play it in ""performance missions"" if a mission is dirt or street you have to use a street car and aston martin can not be tuned for any other race than ""performance"".- for a 2014 game i was expecting a lot better graphics for this game but sadly only cars are really detailed and well designed people and the city enviroment have the graphics of GTA back in 2000s. Cutscenes are nearly like a movie they are really detailed well designed and really high quality but game its self is absolutly awful for a 2014 game.- cop chases are really really stupid and they can be EASILY avoided. road blocks are a joke only one car in the road block and helicopter always runs out of fuel so fast and returns to base so you are safe from air recon. your car is 1000x times faster than police cars they never reach you and you can clearly see this in every escape mission you can avoid them under 20 seconds and win the mission. i personally never got arrested in this game by cops but in NFS 2005 i think at least 30000 times i was being arrested by cops.- crashing physics is really stupid and unreleastic somtimes. you can avoid a hard crash and sometimes by even a small scratch your car gets messed up, it is really random.

												Absolute piece of rubbish. From the unwanted Wild Run ""upgrade"" that is one big advertisement for the Wild Run DLC, to the inexplicable graphical and physics bugs, and the rubberbanding AI, stay away from this game. It doesn't matter if you are a fan of racing games or massive open worlds, this game is not worth your time. Trust me, I've played 100+ hours and I just had the final straw. While playing a long-running faction mission (> 1 hr long) the road disappeared and left me unable to steer, accelerate or brake. I had to abort the mission. The usual fix of bringing up the map doesn't work because you can't bring up the map during missions. If you are a fan of games that have a well-designed difficulty progression then this game is not for you, either. Some missions are overly easy and others that are ranked as easy are next to impossible. Likewise, some hard-ranked missions are way too easy. It's as if random goals were set for each mission and the difficulty rankings were randomly set as well. That said, if you like games where you have to grind to progress, then this game is for you. Not only do you have to grind for upgrades, but just playing the game is a grind. In my experience the most fun thing to do in the game is to free drive with your friends, and not the game itself.

												I was a big fan of TDU2 and this looked a lot like it, which sold me enough to pre-order. 20hrs later and i am as bored and restless as a kid without his ritalin. There is simply nothing to really do in here. There is a story line and little mini trials to get better parts to put on your car, and thats about it. What I really loved in tdu2 was setting up races for the community by going to the street, laying out the checkpoints then racing it to establish a time to beat, also had modes like follow the leader so you and your buddies could enjoy racing against a course as a team instead of just against each other all the time.  I found the car selection to be very limited compared to tdu2 and the physics of the cars didnt feel tight like when you are pushing your own modified car down the street at 100+. It is a beautiful game that runs well turned up to full 4k resolution, but if you have ever had a pretty girlfriend that sucks to talk to and do stuff with then this game should make you feel like you are right back there again,. Have two friends that bought and played this and everytime we talk about playing or do log in, we just kind of sit there and feel like, what now?This most disappointing part is you are probably really looking forward to going to somewhere you drive all the time and checking out how close it is. Ill save you the trouble, it isnt. Im from utah and the entire state looks a bit like a generic park city. Many of the places i have gone and traveled to from here i tried to recreate unsuccessfully. I really want a good driving simulator that does a good job of recreating states, this wasnt it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I would pay max 10£ for this game with all this ♥♥♥♥ bugs appearing every time I play this game. It's a shame though. It could be an amazing game if Ubisoft just put some time and effort fixing the servers and listening to their users!!!! I'm so close to stop playing this game and remove it from my computer even though I have just played for like 2 weaks. It makes me so annoyed and irritated! This could be an amazing MMO.

												With almost 200 hours on record, I think it´s a good time for a review.As in many other racing games, you always want the best car, the best spec, etc, so, I bought the Agera. The Fullstock car is amazing, it´s behavior is quite impressive, even realistic like a sim game, but when I bought the Perf spec for it... Have you ever imagined that a fylly tuned up car would be slower, inferior, on any aspect, comparing to it´s stock version? Well, neither did I.I stop playing this game for a wile after this and, when I saw ""The Wild Run"" i came back to play, to make some money for the bikes and the other car´s specs. It´s been a long time, for me, since thye last time I played a racing game with both cars and bike (last one was Midnight Club 3) and i was really anxious for that. Bikes are good, fun to ride but they are not match for cars. I mean, They do have a great performance, but to compete with cars, they are not as good as they should be. They have improved physics, grafics, but to me, it´s more of the same thing. The game is unbalanced, catchup ruins the game, bikes are way underpowered, extreme specs are way too expensive and hypersports car can loose to a 370z easily. In other words, this game had anything to be great, but it failled miserably.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I cannot reccomend this game in its current state. It's in a obvious beta form, which is unthinkable given how there were 3 open betas before release. It's like Ivory Tower has never made a driving game before. And it IS a driving game, not a racing game. It's all variations of 'point-a-to-point-b' in this game, unless you're being chased by the police or a gang. The AI racers rubberband incredibly badly, the AI police/gang chase vehicles are moving brick walls that can go faster than you on any terrain and can only be outrun through sheer luck. Totally unplayable to people who don't min/max. Sometimes in Freeroam a cop will glitch out and try to arrest you, even though you don't have a wanted level (though him ramming you will cause you to gain one soon enough). The car handling model is hellishly bad when the car is low level and either fun but challenging or boring as hell at high levels depending on the car. The graphics are outdated and has a fair share of bugs. The antialising (aka the anti-pixelation stuff) is pretty much nonexistent, which makes areas with lots of foliage an eyesore. The instances flat out don't work. You can't ever connect to friends or even your crew once you've moved out of the instance you met in, unless you get rematched together out of sheer luck. PvP isn't balanced at all. If you crash once, you lose. If you don't have a fully-specced supercar, you lose. Simple. Money is attained primarily through a system wherein people on your friends list can be used as ammo to start a 3-hour timer to do faction missions in order to get 1/4 the award of the normal payout. All other moneymaking is completely moot.  The endgame is an interminable grind to max out your favorite cars whilst also micromanaging the above-mentioned grinding system. The cars are not very varied- the majority are american muscle cars and random supercars, with a few european tuners here and there. The car parts system is not very well explained (what each part do, etc.) and boring as hell, especially given how to get the best parts you must gring the same jump, speed or hill climb 'skills' for around twenty minutes each for each part for each car. Alternatively, you can spend money to buy parts you unlock for one car for the rest of the same spec. This costs a lot of bucks (ingame cash) but not much crew credits (microtransaction money). Hm...Visual customization is pretty varied for each car but you can't ever equip the stock parts of the Fullspec vehicle. Annoying.Specs are not well thought out. Circuit, Perf and Street are all for road driving in descending order of effectiveness. There's no downside to using a circuit over a perf or a perf over a street. Just straight upgrades. Dirt and Raid could have been rolled into one without an issue (Raid goes better off road, dirt goes better on dirt roads). The story is one of the worst I have ever seen, with extremely cardboard characters and a boring revenge plot that has a totally contrived happy ending and no direction whatsoever. Attempts to be heartwarming or funny fell flat, except for one occasion that made me crack a smile; one Chinese 'Vaas' expy in big debt once enthusiatically said simply 'Money money money money money!' to remind me to do a mission to help him.Story missions are cookie-cutter from something like four or five types but with arbitrary additions, i.e. a 'A-to-B' (they actually call them that) could be 'don't take damage' or 'you've got a time limit' or 'you have to escape pursuit before you reach the destination', often without even any in-story justification. Sometimes an NPC will be in the car, giving you an infodump that you probably won't pay attention to while you haul ♥♥♥ trying to complete the objectives. Or maybe they'll just yell at you every time you bump something using the same three lines. Ubisoft and Ivory Tower failed on every count reguarding this game. This is despite the Betas and the fact that we know Ubisoft knows how to make a good racing game from Driver: SF. It's incredible how bad this game is. I only play it because I want to get my $85's worth, and I'm hoping they'll fix most of these issues in due time. Knowing Ubisoft, it'll just be more DLC and mircrotransactions, but just maybe...TL;DR This game has literally every bad element of every bad driving game ever. Don't buy it.   ",85,3,3,3,2,1,1

Pros- Decent wheel support for an ""arcade driving"" title. At least with a Logitech G27.- OK car physics and handling. Hardcore ""petroheads"" are probably going to laugh at this but from my experience, car handling is fun AND challenging.- Huge and very diverse environment. Driving game with huge environment are not exactly common so...- Nice graphics during sunrise and sunset: Very impressive lightning.Cons- Extremely poor support of TrackIR. Cannot even look behind with it while you can with the mouse!- Glitches: All over the place. Floating cars, ""cars inside"" the road, floating rocks, slight but constant stuttering when loading assets. Heck, during a cut-scene, my car literally went through a prop in the scene!- Intense network rubber banding/teleportation of other players cars.- Washed out, ugly lightning effect during storm and raining... Nights are also very dark. Lightning is not consistent: Range from superb sunrise/sunset to WTF moments at night and during cloudy weather. - The game use some sort of ""instancing"" where players are not necessarily going to encounter each other, even when exactly at the same spot on the map.- Lots of DLC exclusive content and ""buyable with real currency"" cars. Not a fan of the latest.- Of course, UPlay, which totally sucks. Add another layer of unneeded complexity to the whole experience. So, if I could, I would give a ""maybe"" rating. But I can't so, I have to rate it negatively.If you like sand box, non-hardcore driving game, you might find it interesting. Exploring the map is a blast... but expect glitches. Get it during a sale at 50%-80% rebate.			",39,2,2,1,10,0,0

												MUST NOT BUY for following major reasons:1. EXTREMELY BUGGY since the launch of game. Unacceptable issues has been brought up with almost every month's patch which makes us nearly think they're here to make the game worse: how the car viewing angle turned 90deg with chase cam when your car's overlapping another opponent's car in no collision race (solved), stuttering issues for high-end PCs (NOT SOLVED AFTER A YEAR), nitrous not working for online races with manual without at least 1 car reset since Wild Run, NOT SOLVED WHAT THE... , and this March patch what has just turned up? ATI and Nvidea graphics users might not even able to start the game and game crash straight away.2. RUBBISH car physics. Even by arcade standards the physics are pure trolls, EVEN AFTER WILD RUN. For god sake Ubisoft your game engine is based on Atari's Test Drive Unlimited 2. How the hell  could you possibly make it so much worse than that game what the FU*K? O_O TDU2 at least has friendly controls while still retains bit of realism, if by no means much ... but you Ubi, bikes that can go to complete stop from 350km/h/220MPH in less than 2 seconds plus hit the wall at almost 90deg and still no crash, catch-up mechanics and INSANE AMOUNT of slipstream that can allow a car to override top speed by 70km/h and TOTALLY ruins online competition, collision physics that allows your car to ""skid"" past traffic even when u hit them head on, race cars that can go 420km/h with those huge wings+corner 50% faster than in reality ... it's honestly disgusting in its own way. I rather have something even more detached from reality (e.g. Burnout, Ridge Racer) than experiencing your half-♥♥♥♥♥ efforts trying to go for poor extents of realism.2.5. Extra steering rate for non-DirectInput controllers and steering wheels. Ehm yes ... if u uses either 1 of them you have an unfair advantage of being able to steer the front wheels so much at any speeds and the car can still response to such even at likes of 300km/h because of bullsh*t overpowered tire physics.3. Poor online structure. In simplest terms, The Crew uses some of the worst multiplayer connection programming which results in players in the same lobby who're not host to have latency. This often ends up with the host ""off-sync"" from his actual positions causing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stuff including both palyers slipstreaming each other on their own screens and the 3th place host player in a close finish ended up 1st in result screen. ""Summit"" tracks also lacking checkpoints real badly, forcing top players to go for insane shortcuts for majority of them.If you really want to buy a racing game from Ubisoft, honestly, I rather hope you may consider trying out ""POD GOLD"" which is from the f**k-graphics 90s and you can download from GOG site for just $5.99 featuring compatibility for Windows 7 or above. Yes it's full arcade physics and no graphics quality to talk about, but it's got beautifully designed track layout + AI difficulty that can put you to smile for losing so badly just like those games in arcade centres. I can safely bet for most POD is even better than this piece of typical modern crap which other gaming companies seemed to have learnt from EA's NFS somehow just to steal money from kids. Topping with Ubi's Assassin's incident, I swear I would never buy Ubi's racing game for the 3rd time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Three parts boring and/or frustrating ~story~ missions to one part actual decent racing.  You can't reset your saved game and start the game over without buying it again for another account.  You can't have a quick free race by picking a route and car type, you have to replay story missions or do new missions.  Some objects are physics objects you can plow through and others will stop your car dead, and the distinction is arbitrary.  Car customization is sorta okay but really overpriced, and to get more money you have to either farm completed story missions or spend real-world money on microtransaction currency.Not worth it.

												I've had the great pleasure to watch this game blossom from a good idea, to an E3 announcement, to a closed Beta, and then to the released product with constant updates! I've had great pleasure driving in this most massive map, particularly the offroading, the dirt-biking and the skill challenges. I've aimed for and earned the Hummer H1 from the first two weeks of gameplay, and I've taken hundreds and hundreds of screenshots through the excellent Photo Mode feature. Great gameplay, great map, amazing vehicles. Looking forward to the police expansion and the Jeep Wrangler introduction in the next few days! I can't say quite clearly enough how this is the most complete and gracious racing video-game. Congratulations, Ubisoft! My highest regards!			",190,10,6,16,5,1,4

												When im being chased by police in this game it makes me rage more than call of duty because you can be 2 miles away and somehow their crown victoria can catch up to you within 5 seconds.Pros :- Great map, it's really awesome;- Graphics are good;- Cockpit view, the interiors are well designed;- Simcade driving is fun;- Many specs ( Street, Dirt, Performance, Raid and Circuit ).Cons:- Lack of cars, only 47 fullstock cars (if I'm not wrong.);- Exterior car custimization is just poor:- 200 rims ? And you get like the same rim with 3/5 different colors. - The bumpers, some of them the only thing that changes is the headlights.- Stickers, pre-made stickers that you can't even change the color of them;- The MMO , ... when you launch the game you can see like 100 people on the same server as you, but while you are on free-roam you can see up to 8 people. That's like driving offline, with an option to PVP that will take you to a lobby with 4~8 people to race against.- Cockpit view:- When PVPing if there's no collison , the other player will just pass by your car and you won't be able to see nothing in from of you, only a black shade of your oponent.- In cockpit view your mirrors don't work;- AI , the AI is just impossible, if you are being chased by the police it's really hard to escape. You can go 400 km/h with a Circuit SLS on an Highway that a Ford Crown Victoria will chase you down. - Some of the game physics are just out of this world:- You get rammed by another player or a AI car your car just fly's away, you try to ram a cop you get stucked.- You hit a fence or a pile of garbage on the sidewalk you lose like 10/20 km/h;- PVPing, sometimes you need to wait 5 minutes to join a lobby to get rammed mostly.- In PVP the lobby leader (the player with most wins) is the one who dictates wich track you are going to play and the settings, with or without traffic/collision, instead of being choosen by a vote among the lobby players.(...)And there's the Crew Credits, that for me it's neutral, in my point of view they are there to help people that lack of time to ""farm"" money to buy a car that they like, or parts of it, for people that buy the game to play 3/5hours a week.Because you can easily make money doing pvp races (15~18k bucks each race and with perks the most expensive car is like 708k), you can buy all the cars and parts without having to buy the CC's.Should you buy the game?Yes/No.- Yes, if you are into this type of games, but buy it heavly discounted.- No, if you buying it full price, because for the price that they are asking for it they should give players way more stuff and not this. To me this was the most expensive ""early-acess"" that I've ever bought.			",41,3,1,1,2,0,0

												I am in two minds about this game. The gameplay itself is quite enjoyable, it's an arcadey racer much like Driver San Francisco. But there are far too many flaws for me to recommend this. 1) The grind! If you want a decent car you better be prepared to either grind tedious missions over and over or buy some in game credit. Most missions net you 2k, but top of the range cars come in at 700k not including the tuning which some will set you back 500k. That's a lot of grinding for little reward.2) The story is abysmal, I didn't care at all about what was going on or who these people were. Which would be ok if it wasn't for;3) The missions. The missions in this game is the same repetitive few types with different locations/cars. It will either be a race (by far the best), an escape from the cops mission, a checkpoint time trial or a Smugglers Run esque cargo smash. That is as deep as they get and you will soon get bored. 4) Little reward. I don't really consider this a spoiler and I think perspective buyers should be aware. There is no reward for completing the story. No car. No paint job and just the same diddly amount of cash as the rest of the missions. 5) Always online and Uplay. Not really an issue for me but understand this is important for people with limited internet connectionsThat being said there are some positive points to this game. The map is huge and full of landmarks, the Wild Run add on creates a bit more variety, and if you manage to get a crew cruising round the U.S.A can be fun. I have played this with a Logitech Driving Force GT and it will work ok, but the arcade controls are far more suited to a controller, both controller types are supported well with mappable button configs.All in all I can't really recommend this game, especially not at full price, but it may be worth a punt on sale if you are looking for an easy on the eye arcade racing sandbox. It is what it is, and is easilly worth getting on the cheap for the map and crew antics alone.			",416,75,33,52,65,6,52

												What The Crew gets right is its stylised and scaled-down version of the entire continental USA. Cities are shrunken caricatures, but the truly vast sweeping tracts of land between them means traversing it really does capture the spirit of a cross-country, city-to-city road trip better than any driving game before it. Plenty of racing games curate a bunch of different backdrops into their track selections, from urban street races in major American metropolitan centres to icy blasts across snow-swept mountains, flat-out sprints across the baking desert, or muddy expeditions through giant Sequoia forests. The Crew admirably does all this in a single game world you can drive across in one lengthy session.This girth has come at a cost, though. It’s a world that looks fine whipping by you at speed, but it favours sheer size over the kind of granular detail we now expect in modern open world racers. Cities are smattered with recognisable landmarks but don’t really seem built to stand up to stationary scrutiny. Combined with low-detailed NPC cars (complete with entirely black, opaque glass), some forgettable effects (splashing water is especially dire), no weather, and the fact that the models of the 40-or-so cars are in a league below those of contemporaries like Forza Horizon 2 or Driveclub, The Crew struggles to shake the look of a game several years older than it actually is.

But this game is glitchy at times and the scenary is mostly bad. Of course though this game is suited for low graphics range that makes the game more playable but makes the scenary worse. I don't reccomend you get it on the pc but do get on the PS4. If you have shortage of screen cut off that is mostly because you may not have 1080p. That is okay, still play it!			",18,2,1,0,0,0,0

												Nice race game whit decent (last gen) graphics.And whit that i think i've said everything.The game has been downgrade A LOT ! to match the older xbox and ps to.The game has a weak story line, music sucks and the map...It is supose to be in Amerika but does it not even looks like Amerika whatsoever...You know you in Amerika cus you wil run into some objects that tell you you are but thats it.The mirrors in the car just simple plain stupid don't work... IT IS 2015!!! ,,, ( uhh was it? )The offroad handling is worse then the new drift systeem that is comming to the crew at a later dlc.It doesn't make you feel you are driving offroad. it looks like you trying to use you bike in 3 meter high snow.After you have beaten the story, or gave up on it and lvlt though till cap.You will notice that you unlock the big races, those races are pvp aswel as pve.Which is more the way to make money because there is no other way.So you will find yourself driving a race in real time taking you 3 hours for a 1 mill reward.You don't have a real garage or any engine customization.yes this should be a thumb down. but on pc this is all we got now.And it is better then need for speed world ever would be.But worth a pricetag of 14.99 comparing the quality of the devs putting in the game.

After the beta and release, the AI rubberbands and it's terrible, the servers suck, and the car health and damage was taken out.------------Pros: - Huge World, variety of envrionments, cockpits are nice, some envrionments look nice.------------Cons: - TERRIBLE physics, terrible AI, Terrible races, cop chases, the cities are tiny, a lot of copy and paste, could use more cars, customization was over-hyped, boring story and campaign, poorly optimized, servers suck (NOT AN MMO), micro-transactions (After spending $60, really?), speedometer is off, roads feel like ice, damage physics are bad and weird, Uplay, and the fact it's published by Ubisoft.------------It would of been a cool racer, but all of these things make it quite boring and very over-hyped and dissapointing. Ubisoft probably pushed the game so it screwed up.------------Even on sale, don't purchase, you'll be dissapointed.			",189,16,7,11,18,1,21

												For a game that was intended to be fully about player custimization and choices. As well as a huge diversity in the way you drive. This game falls short. Extremely short. This is by far one of the worst excuses for a racing game I have ever seen, after the first hour or two, you'll be completely bored and out of will to do more of the grindy missions, with the generic story. But then again, it's a Ubisoft game, we can't get our hopes up with them folks, they are one of the WORST names in gaming as of 2016, stop buying their cashgrabs and trash, I surely will.

												The Crew is basically what people wanted after black box got fired. It has a big map that can take minutes to hours to explore with a lot of variety when it comes to terrain and climate. There is hidden wrecks that you can find across the map with different specs such as Street Dirt raid perf and curcuit. Most of the wrecks are hot rod based and they have a lot of features when it comes to customization. There is a lot of customization in the game such as bumpers spoilers skirts vinyls rims paint but there is something that has been bugging me and that is that some cars doesn't have that much customization options if not anything at all. Like the maserati gran turismo s you basically have no options here except for changing the OFFICIAL rims or the OFFICIAL colours. You can't customize the gran turismo s. And in curcuit spec there isn't that much options either you basically get a big body kit but with no options to change it. Just like raid spec you only get that 1 body kit. Also there is a lot of cars / specs from the trailer missing in the game and cars that I would love to be in the game. there is only 2 import tuners in the game and that is the 370z and the skyline R34. Where is the Evo's or the RX7 / RX8's Supra's GT86's ETC? The 2012 Dodge charger has mitsubishi evo parts but it isn't the same. The story is very short and very difficult trough the end most likely just to make the gameplay longer. I'm not sure if this game was rushed or they just lost their creativity but if you bought this game just for the story you will be very dissapointed. It feels like the full game didn't include the full story and it just ended too fast.The physics are very weird in this game. Sometimes you will get random cutscenes where your car flips and crashes which is skip-able but still can get annoying at times. ESPECIALLY during missions or pvp races.After exploring almost every part of the  crew bought and customized almost every car in the game and found almost all of the wrecks there isn't that much to do anymore. Sure it is fun to do road trips at times but it can get very repetetive.Overall: Awesome game for cruising and customization but it lacks some features such as fenders specs and cars. Especially japanese cars which highly dissapointed me because there is only 2 japanese cars in the game :S Huge map with a lot of different areas to explore and cruise with your friends.8/10			",54,1,16,0,5,0,0

												I will write a quick, straight on review for those who are wonder how the game is.This come from 33 hours of gameplay, story done, top 90th in pvp some days ago.There are things that bothers me about the game:-Customization part is that there aren't really many hoods, bumpers and stuff to chose from they mostly have little details changing between them, and they are usually tied to a spec, so this mean, no Skyline stock hood on a Perfomance spec Skyline! Bumpers and the rest are usually repetitive, not to mention the vynils You can't change their colours.-MMO feeling, this is the misleading part. In your world (your session) you will only be able to see 8 players on the whole US (at least for now) Yes, 8 this is not your typical MMORPG where you see hundred of people. So keep that in mind if you were thinking about it- Lack of JDM cars: Only three. Ain't gonna describe this much, just three, the rest is almost entire muscle cars with some european exceptions._______________________________________________________________________Story is entertaining, not much to add into this part, characters are fine, not precisely boring, but nothing out of this world :]Cops are incredibly fast, think about artificial difficulty, just like that, a crown vic can catch your LaFerrari full throttle, something like Most Wanted, but way more aggresive, if you like challenges, then i guess you will like it, but sometimes, it's a bit unfair, and they don't share the same physics as your car (you can't slam them offroad, they are like anchors)One important thing, people tend to whine about the boat handling like GTA IV. It gets A LOT better on the mid-end game, the starter cars are the problem, and the fact it's a MMO, you NEED to level up to get better handling, speed, and so on, and it is highly recommend to play without assists.Cars are all the same performance wise when you upgrade their parts to max, this means that if you are not a 16 y/o bugatti fan, your favorite $50k grand car will be able to compete to an Agera R and not remain obsolete in the the early levels!Cruising on the states is an amazing feeling, at least that's what i felt since im kind of NA enthusiast in the future. Just keep in mind that this game is way better with friends, so you better get someone in with you. It will make the exploration feeling incredible, and there are plenty of stuff to do. From Skills, to PvP, and Co-Op missions (races up to 2,5h and maybe more!)To finish this quick review, my final words:I think the game is on sale somewhere (christmas season maybe?)Is the game worth it's full price? If you ask me, i do not regret it. Is it fun even in solo? It is, yeah pretty much. Will it be supported for a long time? It's a game that doesn't have a direct competitor on PC, so think about it :]See you in the States if you decide to give it a try! Claxon me up if you see a Gun Metal Gray R34 rocketing on the roads ;]			",130,8,6,10,6,2,10

Steam says like 14 hours playing, i was able to complete the first mission and then drive around for a bit, the rest of the ""Play time"" is the time it took to install it over and over and over, trying to get it to work. Now, will not play at all, even after a clean install of windows. Worst investment ive ever made.			",24,4,4,8,0,0,1

Driving the cars in this game with my Logitech Driving Force GT feels so relaxing after a stressful day.Got the Complete Edition on sale. I didn't buy this game initially since there were mixed reviews about this game. But now I feel bad for not buying this game earlier. This game is so underrated. This game is so much fun while cruising with friends. There were days I played this game sacrificing my sleep. Everyday, after coming home from work I used to spend time in gaming. I didn't expect the cars to have realistic driving physics because I just wanted to drive and have fun. Isn't that gaming is all about? I love the weather cycle, different terrains, meeting different people who drive along with you, competing with other players online,etc. I don't have anything to hate about this game.

												Bought this game a year or so ago. Had fun with it, but it was a bit lacking in content, so i got bored pretty quickly. finally pick it back up, expecting after having purchased the ♥♥♥♥ing season pass to have the new content, only to have it quickly hammered into my skull that despite downloading it, all that other good ♥♥♥♥, Ubisoft, in their infinite wisdom, have decided to ignore years of tradition with season passes, and make you still buy Wild Run seperately in order to participate, However, the events are there on your map, and cannot be ingored. So no, I don't reccomend this game. In fact, i'm done reccomending ANY Ubisoft games, as this crap combined with Far Cry: Primal simply being a cut down and reskinned fallout 4, have completely put me off them as a company. Buyer beware. Ubisoft will screw you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I want to like this game. I really really do. But, I just can't. After tons of hours played, the game's mechanics halt the fun. From cops and traffic to ""wow"" style car upgrades, you can't get over the fact that this game's ""arcade"" feel isn't arcade at all.The game is bad. There's no way else to put it. I've played the game for hundreds of hours and given it chance after chance after chance. I love the car selection. I love the map size. I HATE the game! The game RUINS the experience completely.The story is SO cheesy and bad. It's just bad, bad, bad. It's as if a passionate professional made half a car simulation game, then a buch of dumb teenagers took that idea and made it into a wow-like mmo loot system with the most ODD objectives NO ONE in a car would EVER do.The traffic and cop AI is .. well, it's non existant is what it is. Take how bad it was in NFS Rivals times about 10,000 or so and you have how bad the AI is in this game. It's bad.The game is bad. The game is bad. The game is bad.			",160,26,2,29,41,0,26

												Got the gold edition. This game is absolutely TERRIBLE. It crashes randomly for no apparent reason after 5-10 minutes of gameplay.. MANY people in the Steam community have had this issue for a very long time, and only with this game... Despite numerous complaints in Steam forum and the game developers forums; they have not fixed this issue at all. All the $ I invested into this game bought a BIG frustrating headache of inablity to play the game for more than 15 minutes at a time without it crashing. I re-installed the Operating System and all the latest drivers twice, on two seperate machines and then re-installed this game twice and the problem did not get resolved. This is NOT a hardware issue, but a well known problem reported by many who own this game--that has not been fixed in many, many months. Trust me please, save your $ and don't buy this!! If they fix it I will change my review, but until they fix it DO NOT BUY IT. You will deeply regret it as so many of us have.			",15,0,5,1,2,0,0

												If it's not the trial and error pursuit races where you have to try 5 times before you memorize when and where the target makes turns so you can finally hit it, it's the dubious escape from police events where they accelerate a lot faster than you regardless of how upgraded you are, or it's the normal races where your car bounces upwards off bizarrely elasticized hills and curbs and into trees and walls, where you bounce again as if your car sides were made of rubber, to face backwards while the AI zooms past you, or just coincidentally the traffic is in such a way you have to slow down to dodge traffic as you take the turn and lose seconds. Incidentally the graphics may be acceptable for PS4 or XBOX One but they are a bit of a letdown compared to other racing games on the PC, if you have a high end card.Not that you care, as you lose control of your vehicle every twenty seconds, or try to make goals that require the RND to smile on you. Not a good racing game. Regret spending my money terribly. I'm going back to Hot Pursuit, where at least banging each other's cars and making chases actually feels like play and not like player abuse.			",169,62,1,32,21,1,30

												Prelude and Tl;Dr    I beta-tested The Crew back when it was first announced for beta, and at that point I believed there was true potential to the game. The story, while cliche, wasn't terrible like some other racing games of late. A large and open world full of sights, and iconic cars. BUT, as release came, I am left wondering what if anything they did, Servers are worse than anything I have experienced, Only 25ish cars, physics that beg belief, and a map upon further inspection leaves you scratching your head in disbelief at the laziness of the devs. So no I do not recommend this game, it has some good moments in the free driving, yet you still have that nagging presence of all the issues and poor quality.The map    One of the positive things of the Crew is the map, it is big, ~100km across and has some detail in it. Honestly you can spend hours driving and still be discovering new places, which makes cruising down a road and being able to say, ""what is that"" and go find out the best part of the Crew. However the map has massive issues, a mesh that makes even games from the 90's shudder to look at. Case in point, just driving over a desert, which is pretty flat, you will occasionally ramp off and spin out, all due to such a low polygon count that the ground is jagged and often impractical. It is bad enough I will not use my FFB wheel in the crew due to the jolts it will give the mechanisms in the wheel. The textures are barely passable for a game of 2014, and often are quite lack luster. And the bounding boxes on object and the road often do not match the objects and can cause frustrating moments as you spin off or stop dead due to a fence or some invisible outcrop in a building. MAP (6/10).The Cars   there are only ~25 of them, and there isn't much different between them when they are in the respective specs. Also the specs available to put on a car are limited, some cars can have all, while others can only have one spec installed. AWD cars feel like FWD cars, RWD cars feel like drift cars. The Physics are at their best are abysmal and often cause a moment of frustration followed by eruption of laughter as your car is catapulted from hitting a foot high rock into the sky. There is also a general disregard to grip as cars tend to slide more than turn. CARS(5/10) PHYSICS (3/10)The Specs   The specs offer the true differences between cars as some will be off-road ""capable"" (nothing is prepared for the horrible polygon density) and others fast on road. There can be some fun to be had racing the different specs, but the physics issue often steals most of the fun, when the other issues are not. The Missions/Skill Challenges   Fun, for the first couple, then a long drag to the end, often making you look at the next mission and groan. The race type is straight forward, the checkpoint missions often are the only ones that are enjoyable, the takedown missions are messed up and often don't recognize the hits, and the smash the crates are just plain idiotic. As for the skill challenges... Jumps are awesome, speeds makes you hate the traffic, scrambles frustrate, race lines are meh, presicion frustrates, slaloms make you hate traffic, seeing the pattern? MISSIONs(4/10)The AI   ♥♥♥♥♥♥ than PayDay 2, nuf said... AI(1/10)Servers   Yeah, what servers? Can't stay connected for more than an hour and often dumps you out of the race at the end when in COOP giving you no rewards for the hour long race you just completed. Often can't see friends who are right in front of me. SERVER(0/10)Pay2Win...Summary (4/10)  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its not terrible. The game  itself is fun, but it is kind of a waste in a way also. Given the size of the map and extremely small amount of visible players allowed, it feels pretty much dead. It claims it is a living game, but in reality it isn't. There is nothing innovative about this game. Basically it is a prettied up version of NFSW with less visible players and a better map. It is always online, so if they decide to shut down servers, you won't even be able to play it. Other players in the game seem to keep to themselves, have yet to find a pvp match or co-op in time played and I queue for it fairly often. I bought this game on sale and still feel kind of ripped off. I'd give it a thumbs up if it was in the under 10 section, but its not.			",43,1,5,7,3,0,1

												This game is pretty decent. If you were a fan of test drive unlimited you'd love this game easily. Ample amount of customzation with a sizable campaign to boot. Handling was a good experience to me, but I can see where some people have their complaints about it being a little loose. There is rubberbanding with the AI drivers which is very annoying in long races where you can build a big lead. Cops are ruthless and will trap you easily if you're not careful. Overall there's a lot to do in the game and can sink hours and and hours into it easily. Very fun with friends. Fun to travel and tweak cars to constantly improve them to see that car level rise. Highly recommend this game!			",253,15,15,26,10,2,15

												The Crew is an open world racing game from 2014. It was developed by Ivory Tower and Ubisoft Reflections. Published by Ubisoft, the game recreated a cut down version of North America where the player can partake in many activities including a story and free roaming. The Story centres around the main character Alex. He is being chased by the cops. His brother Dayton is the leader of an organisation called the 5/10 motor club. When they are meeting together a car pulls up and Dayton is shot and later dies. Alex is arrested and and convicted because of a corrupt FBI agent with ties to the 5/10's. Five years later Alex is offered a deal by an agent called Zoe to be released on the condition that he agrees to expose the FBI agent's corruption. Driven by his need to find out the truth behind his brother's murder Alex infiltrates the 5/10 organisation and climbs his way towards the top with help from the FBI. The story takes Alex across all the USA in his quest to find the truth.The Crew: Wild run is an expansion to the original game giving it a complete graphical overhaul and adding weather effects, motor bikes and monster trucks. The story missions of the crew have more than 20 hours of content. The missions mainly include different types of races and time trials not to mention the raid missions where you have to hit all the boxes before time runs out. There are also skill markers all over the map to make your free roaming more interesting. The skills can be: follow the driving line, see how fast you can go, also there is one where you have to hit the markers. Besides the main story there are many races marked on the map and some go for over one hour.I found the game really fun to play, both the story missions and the other challenges scattered about the map. The graphics were pretty good and the difficulty was not too hard. I found the best way to save money was to use one car for all the story missions as every challenge you accomplish gives your car performance upgrades. One annoying thing about the game is that it is always online so if you lose the internet you will get kicked from the game. Annoying if you have bad internet. I played the game with an Xbox controller for Windows and was quite satisfied. There are some bugs in the game like wild life being able to knock cars around by touching them and people just running around in circles. Apart from this the game was quite polished. The game also has the quick travel feature so you don't have to travel where you have already been. Apart from a few bugs and server issues I give this game:7.3/10			",81,11,13,3,7,3,0

												T-Boned a car, whilst going 323km/h down a road, launching it vertically 20 meters in the air and 30 meters down the road.Respawned from the crash, car is still in the air10/10 would Crash againEdited Proper Review as of 11/12/2014.Warning 'The Crew' is not a Simulation racing game, it is an ARCADE Racer.if you are looking for a decently fun racing game to play. 'The Crew' is a considerable choice for this.There are few issues however with the game such as.The Cops and pursuers are OP, especially so in the earlier levels of the game. Later on as you become a higher level, they do become less OP, but are still OP but not to the same level as they were when you first begun the game. The cops aren't that hard if you know how to use the Specs of cars properly. There is a large number of people complaining about this issue, most likely a majority of these people, have no clue how to drive each of the specs of cars correctly. (Don't be one of these people, learn the specs correctly).Warning, this isn't a Racing Simulator don't be like the Racing Elitest like those that are prowling the Forums.'The Crew' does have some other teething issues, such as occasional lag during co-op missions, Lack of connectivity to other players and difficulty connecting to friend when attempting to join each others crew's (I'm from a country that the national average internet speed is 10 mbps, and the lag isn't even that horrendous for me) .  These issues, are considered to be Teething issues, as the game hasn't even ben out for 2 full weeks yet, the people ♥♥♥♥♥ing about all of these issues aren't taking this into consideration, and these people aren't taking in to consideration that almost no games at launch are 100% Glitch Free / 100% Bug Free / Balance correctly / have no lag and connection between players is working correctly.This being said 'The Crew' is actually quite an enjoyable game to play, as summarised, there are a balancing issues, connectivity issues, etc If you are thinking of purchasing this game, honestly if you don't mind not playing with some friends or dealing with occasional OP AI pursurer/cops, then you should definitely purchase this game.If any of these issues do effect you eg occassional Lag, connectivity issues with friends or you get really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the cops for some reason, as if you have a deep seeded issue with all forms of Law Enforcement. Then i would wait a bit for these issues to be fixed by ubisoft.7/10 (would be 8.5 or 9, if the connectivity issues and balancing issues were corrected :D )			",174,8,4,11,12,1,7

												So i'm kinda going to start with the things that are bad with the game (that are bad for the moment will say) first the civilian ai in the game are the worst ai I have encountred in a car game but still you can avoid them fairly easy just that sometimes they are really like determed to stop you and just trying to make you fail the second thing is that you will either find it hard or even impossible to play with your friends and have a crew with three other people at the same time I can join in a crew with all my friends but all of them can't join each other some of them can't join each other witch make it hard to play with all of them but I can still join with one or two of them at the same time so it's enough right now I guess and remember it's still haven't been a week sins launch and it's an mmo and a mmo never has a good lauch they always enounters issus and problems they didn't expect and the crew have been haveing a fairly good start compared to other mmoswhats good with it is the gameplay like the story line that can be a bit hard but you can always have your friends helping you with the missions you find hard and personlly i really like there awards I have almost 7500 AP so far (half of them) because they are fun,challanging and they can take a long time to accomplish and the last thing i want to say about the crew is there faction system witch is great for even if you or your friends have choosed wrong faction so you are in diffrent factions so can you still change faction every seven day to make sure that you are in the same faction and also the faction missions are fun and time comsuming because there is some faction mission that takes over two and a half hour to do and when you do faction missions you get alot of money and some repetetion to your faction witch gives you money ones every day and you do also get RP by doing pvp races I hope that you will buy this game and see for yourself how fun it's and please don't hate it for it issus i'm sure it will be fixed soon			",315,48,19,45,32,3,39

												you hit a car with 400 kms per hour, you are still driving. you near miss a car with 60 kms per hour, BAM, you wreck your car. and when you get 100 uplay points and finally get the stunning viper, hit just one sign, and try to drive first person. you just cant because your lovely bumper bumps out like it is trying to reach god and it wont let you drive until you get your car fixed. and well i have been wronged about mirrors my whole life i think because ubisoft told me that mirrors have a grey color and they dont reflect well i guess they dont know what a mirror is, see if you make a racing game, mirrors should reflect. they have LOTS of cars like 30 or 40? :/ are you fkin kidding? even need for speed underground had more. (and weird thing is that i missed underground because at least cars were not worth 5 times a bugatti veyron). i expected that this game would be huge, lots of drivers on servers, no lagging and stuff, but this game showed me that this is just my imagination. the players are laggy and at least a session can contain players up to 8 players!!! YAY! i mean even races in a regular racing game or the races in this game is sometimes with 10 people, what about that? whatever yes i know i have a playtime of 3059672409658246940968 hours or something, but these are the truth.

												This game statisfy what a good online racer game is supposed to be. most players that did not liked this game plays realistic racers such as Forza or Grand Turismo. as for the other portion of players they will really be pleased whit this game since it have a NFS: Most Wanted and Test Drive Unlimited taste, witch is pretty good for a release from ubisoft, even tho, its true that some bugs remains, as other big games had before when they got out, but we know they will get those bugs fixed, so thats not a big suprise or a big deal about it and it can happen, at least those bugs are noting major, (unless you have a crappy internet connection)For the Interested, here is the Pros/Mids/Cons of the game.PROS++ Racing coop (up to 4 player max per mission or pvp game)+ Very detailed environment (Working NPC's, a lot of Wilflife and alot of map details)+ Better graphics than Test Drive Unlimited 2+ Detailed leaderboards and statistics for everything+ Good car handling and controls (with a few exceptions since its a NFS styled game) + Polices Forces that can chases you almost evrywhere. (give challenge somtimes)+ Open world where you can drive wherever you want (Even discover some easter eggs in the world)+ Good transition between game cinématics and gamplay (So you fell like you gived control of it after mission movies.)+ Posibility to send your friend do faction missions for you. (so you can save time instead of doing a 2h mission for a bit more of easy game money)+ 50 Cars for first release batch (Witch is not bad for a game that features quite detailed car interiors)+ Offers car customisation such as pre-fab vynils/stickers, Rims, Spoilers and some chasis mods. ( Alot more visual customisation to offer compared to TDU2)+ Day and Night Cycle SystemMIDS~~ Servers are down for maintenance sometimes. (yes it can happen, its an online game)~ Uplay Launcher (at least i can be used / merged whit steam tho)~ Storymode is a bit short. (but is still entertaining to watch)~ Missing Mirrors Animations for Cockpit view in some Cars. (they already working on it already for next patch )~ Weather conditions changes only when you go the mountains where there is snow (they might could use a bit rain but its not that bad)~ Can have unblanced AI (depending if you and your crew have to high level gap)CONS-- No offline mode (you need a internet connection to play this game)- No possibility to add your own Music (but you can customise your playlist atleast)- MicrotransactionsSo as so far for the rest for the game and the gamplay itself, the pleasure of free roaming those cars with friends is pretty Neat, if your one of thos players who dislike this game, just go back to driveclub or what so ever other racing sim game you were playing, otherwise if your looking for car tunning, driving everywhere from road to montains, and like fast paced races for the fun of playing it, this game i what you are looking for !All together i would say, ""The Crew"" is a cool game to play for cruising around with Friends or even to play alone i would say, sure the game have some bugs and have a litle lack on MMO since its more concentrated on the NFS genre gamplay but is worth the price when we know they will comme up whit more !(10 thumbs up)Continue the good work Ubi we know that you can do it and update this until perfaction as other titles did before !!(Afterall They made Driver San Fransico a great fun game so why not the crew !)

												(AFTER 20+ HOURS EDIT) This game did not turn out the way it felt early on. You feel like a total Bad@$$ through the first bit, then you keep playing with the same car, just little upgrades to it, then you keep playing, and keep playing, and keep on... Eventually, you beat the final race, and you've still only got the first car you bought (or in my case with pre-order, a Mclaren). My in-game wallet after the whole story line, was just enough to buy a mid-range car. Anything in the modern era that's considered a ""SuperCar"" was still too much for me, but hey! You can always buy credits on their system to get enough, only a mere $XX.xx+ to unlock this car! Unfortunatly, you can see below from my review, I was hoping this would feel like Test Drive Unlimited, which I have 200+ hours in (on xbox) but it just did not meet up. In test drive, after the story you feel rich, buying mansions, yachts, bugatti veyrons, etc. In this, you'd be lucky to end up with a mid-range prius. Unfortunatly, The 5 other people ever online do not seem to be driving anything in the super car range either, so there's nobody to ask how they made their money. Oh well, another dust collector.(Old Review) What can I say. I'm a sucker for open world racing games.This game feels like TDU3, the game I've always dreamed of. I put many hours on TDU2 (Xbox) and always looked for a game that would compare. Need for speeds customization features have just gone off the radar since they're underground series, which is the only thing that made that series fun. The Crew, although just played in beta, felt like a perfect combination of the two games. A decent amount of cars (Will be 50-60 from what I've heard) lots of customization, and lots of land to drive. It took me about 2.5 hours to drive from New York to San Francisco. I made a few stops in Vegas, Grand Canyon, And other landmarks of course. I can't get enough of this game, and can't wait for the full version to be released.			",364,77,18,59,81,5,54

												The singleplayer aspect of this game is a bit boring. The story seems rushed. However, just like the trailer, I feel like this game is not meant to be played alone and is meant to be played in a crew. The people I've met in PvP events are by far one of the friendliest community in a video game. Just cruising with high end cars from New York City to Los Angeles just talking to the people online makes this game so enjoyable. As for cars, I like the variety. Although it is not close to the amount of cars in say Gran Turismo or Forza, just upgrading a mustang into a Monster spec is so satisfying. You could also win DLC vehicles from special events, which gives an incentive to play more. Furthermore, they keep updating and releasing more specs for cars. This is by far not the best game I've played; however, it is my favorite racing game.			",37,6,0,10,20,0,28

												It's a solid racing game bogged down by having to be always online and an unoriginal story. At most it's a 7/10. The game itself is fun with friends, and most of the 22 hrs I've played the game was spent driving coast to coast with my friends. The map is huge and the races are repetitve. If you haven't bought and you enjoy racing games get it. It's not bad but it's also not good. It's average and for some reason I think that is due to it being published by Ubisoft.

												This game is kinda good only if you don't do story and didn't set controls to hardest ones without having a racing wheel.(since several cars suck at handling too much...) Buy it only on discounts!(since it costs too much...)Main review part:Graphics: Good but they eat too much so i have to play on medium to not to lag @10 fps :x (8/10)Gameplay: It's kinda good, but some moments are too bad (when you have to rekt someone for example)(7/10)Controls: Menu navigation sux, car handling: okay, but not realistic(ice+any OP car=powersliding 24/7, but if we go ""nub mode"" and set full assist, we don't powerslide -.-) (5/10)Story: Good for NFS, not good for everything else xD at least no unethical ♥♥♥♥ so its okay... (6/10)Setting: 1:50(i think) scale USA is kinda cool, and a lot of cars to choose... (10/10)End-Game playability: Best part of this game is endgame cuz you have much todos and PvP, but.. that means grinding which is not good in racing kind of games...(parts for example) (7/10)Overall rating: Game is kinda decent, but overpriced and you must rush thru story to get to interesting part... Btw there is some other alternative to it which is much betr, but has no nfs stuff, its Test Drive Unlimited 2... kinda decent time waster, so try it out too! (much cheaper. but those edays dev support is almost nothing :c)Rank: B (7,1/10)			",61,6,7,14,5,0,6

												The only reason you should buy this game, and I stress this, the ONLY reason, is if you love the idea of driving around the United States of America. The map is the selling point of this game. A gigantic condensed map of the US, Driving corner to corner it a moderately quick car, enjoying the sights and the roads, will take you about 2 hours or so. The map is just so massive and diverse, and once you get out of Detroit and Chicago, it is so ridiclously pretty. I am biased as I have travelled all over the US, so I know city they are trying to show off. They have captured the essence of each city fairly well, with perhaps an exception of Detroit, New York and Chicago, which seem very dull, likely due to the lack of crime, pedestrians and traffic. Many of the other cities look and feel pretty spot on, especially approaching Las Vegas. However, this is the only positive of the game.The car selection is limited and dissapointing. They all handle horribly. To get something remotely playable, you need to greatly fine tune the handling, otherwise it is far too vague and unresponsive.The story in The Crew is so bad, it makes any Need For Speed story worthy of an Oscar in comparion.The game is a true dissapointment in every sense of the word... except for the map. Once you have the handling fine tuned to something remotely playable, and you manage to find one car of any remote interest. Once you hit the road and just drive, this game is more enjoyable than any other sandbox driving game, Forza Horizon included. Driving around the coasts, paticularly near New Orleans, Miami and over towards Texas is a sight to see. Driving through New Mexico at night or early evening/morning is unreal.

												After about 23 hours as of this review I'd say I have enough time under my belt to write a review so here it goes (If there are any spelling errors or gramatical errors, forgive me I type pretty fast and make mistakes). And yes UPLAY is needed for the CREW (some say this is bad some don't care. I'm one of those that don't care)The crew I had many speculation's about because people had said that it wasn't an MMO or very open world, and that you had to drive up on hills to find these stations that reveal the map like in assassins creed. People also said the story is very short and not interesting at all. So firstly let me make my claim over these.Is the crew an MMO?   A. No it is not, you are locked into a session of 8 people and you will never see more than that. Someone may leave the game and a new one will join in your session but that's about it. For the most part you see people here and there and maybe you drive by them or pull up and rev your engine to race, but that's it. Other than the PVP events and races you're pretty much flying solo on this one.Is the crew open world?   A. YES and in a very big way. Ever since Need for Speed hot pursuit I wanted another racing game with a very open world aspect and the CREW (for me) delivers in a big way. You start out in detroit but you can drive on down to Miami and then drive to the Grand Canyon, up to Niagra Falls and down to L.A. To me, that's pretty damn awesome. Now, is The CREW a realist representation of the USA? Yes and No, Yes they have included many major cities and landmarks as well as some famous and surrounding towns but for the most part it's highways and open roads. But they have done well to add in many other key things in between such as marshes down in Miami, many farmlands in the Midwest. And a lot of the forestry seen is pretty on par with what would be in the surrounding terrain. So is it a 100% accurate rendition of the US? No, because otherwise you'd spend days to just drive down to Miami. But is it a big open world that is like the US and offers a lot of Free Driving fun? Yes, in a BIG way.Do you reveal the map with Viewpoints like in AC?    A. Kind of, you have data stations which detail monuments and skill mini games found on the roads, that's pretty much it. Where the revealing of the map comes into play is when you drive on a road or in an area it starts to reveal the map where you drove. The only other kind of ""Drive and find this"" is the hidden car parts for hot rod's and that's about it.Is the story bad?    A. In my opinion it's OK, it feels like Ubisoft was going for a Fast and the Furious kind of story in a sense. But the bulk of the story is cutscenes and using races to solve issues which makes the story kind of boring here and there. But I do keep guessing as to how the story will play out so it's kept my attention at least. Now I'll detail Pro's and Con's of the crewPro's-Open world-A fair selection of cars to choose from-Lots of customization for your cars-Driving and racing is fun-Driving controls are good (I use an xbox360 controller)-Many different car customization options for off road, racing, street racing, circuit racing, etc.-For a racing game it doesn't look bad, you generally focus on the roads and your car (cars look like they are a high texture though) so texture quality isn't a huge biggy, up close you can see the lower textures but like I said, you're driving and racing in 3rd person so it's not an issue.Con's-Not an MMO, an 8 player session is not an MMO, I'd prefer if anything a 32 player session or maybe 50. I think an MMO style with hundreds of people racing could become hectic.-Framrate dips in big cities with lots to load. I'm running a GTX 980 Ti and see frame rates of 20-30 FPS in larger cities, all other times I usually got around 40-50's even in forests.-Even more customization options would be good-Microtransactions to buy more money and ""CREW credits."" You don't have to do this and can easily earn your money by just playing but this micro transaction method in gaming really needs to stop. You can also pay $3(I think) for some other vehicles that can only be bought with your real money but they aren't anything special luckily.-No custom music options in-game, this is something I really wish they put it. No idea why they can't. It's not a huge issue because I can just run it in borderless windowed and run a playlist of my own stuff on the side but it's still a minor inconvenience.Overal I'd give the crew maybe a 7.5/10. It's fun and a really awesome open world driving game, I just wish more people could be in a session and framerate dips in larger cities weren't a thing.			",161,13,2,17,12,0,6

												It's good. Really good. The driving isn't the most realistic, but that doesn't matter, compared to what the game offers. The map is huge and feels so, too. There are no walls or borders within the map, if you see it, you can drive there. To the north are mountains in the south is the Mexican border. Inbetween is a nice mix of everything; salt flats, snowy mountains, woodland. Tuning is basically unlimited. You can keep your first car and race it in every event, you don't have to purchase new cars to progress. The selection of cars is good, too. I like classic muscle cars and finished the game with only two cars, a '69 Charger for everything but the Raid class, and a Camaro for raid. All other cars where just gimmicks for free drive. The cockpit view is great, it feels real and you have a good field of view. The music is nice, too. A good selection of tracks for all genres. You can also create a custom radio station with the ingame songs, picking what you like from all other stations. But not everything is good, you need to be online to play. If you disconnect, it's game over. Usually not much of an issue, unless you are within the last miles of a long 1h+ endurance race. I recommend this game to everybody who wants a good driving game with alot to do in a large world.			",105,15,5,7,15,0,7

												Love the game, but I bought the season pass shortly after The Crew first came out on steam ($75 total including game), and am disappointed to see that The Wild Run is not included. That's $25 more than I've ever spent on one steam game, and $15 more than the complete package costs now. I understand that the price of some games go down over time, or sometimes appear as deals, but early buyers of Season Pass should get some compensation for NOT getting the one major DLC, especially considering that it was not disclosed in the original deal - On the very same page where I purchased season pass, The Wild Run was listed as an upcoming DLC. Had I known all you got were a handful of extra cars, I would not have purchased it.Seems a little ""bait and switch"" eh? I still reccommend the game if you buy it NOW, promises unbroken, but I will not be buying the Wild Run DLC, because I was led to believe I had already paid for it. Shady practice, Ubisoft...

The map is an abridge vesion of the United States. Major landmarks and cities appear, but smaller, lesser known places are absent from the game. Players can drive on or off the roads, and can use different car ""specs"" to traverse the land easier. These specs can be visually customized to fit the player. Performance upgrades are also available. Car selection is varied but limited. DLCs are available for more cars. The driving physics are arcade-like compared to simulation-like. Note: it is an 'always online' game.Overall, it's a ""meh"" racing game. 6.5/10Buy on sale.			",55,3,6,4,8,0,2

												With wild run patch the game is now a lot better than before! And thankfully you don't need to actually buy the dlc to have the improvements, just update the game will give you all...very very nice thing.

												This game is kinda good only if you don't do story and didn't set controls to hardest ones without having a racing wheel.(since several cars suck at handling too much...) Buy it only on discounts!(since it costs too much...)Main review part:Graphics: Good but they eat too much so i have to play on medium to not to lag @10 fps :x (8/10)Gameplay: It's kinda good, but some moments are too bad (when you have to rekt someone for example)(7/10)Controls: Menu navigation sux, car handling: okay, but not realistic(ice+any OP car=powersliding 24/7, but if we go ""nub mode"" and set full assist, we don't powerslide -.-) (5/10)Story: Good for NFS, not good for everything else xD at least no unethical ♥♥♥♥ so its okay... (6/10)Setting: 1:50(i think) scale USA is kinda cool, and a lot of cars to choose... (10/10)End-Game playability: Best part of this game is endgame cuz you have much todos and PvP, but.. that means grinding which is not good in racing kind of games...(parts for example) (7/10)Overall rating: Game is kinda decent, but overpriced and you must rush thru story to get to interesting part... Btw there is some other alternative to it which is much betr, but has no nfs stuff, its Test Drive Unlimited 2... kinda decent time waster, so try it out too! (much cheaper. but those edays dev support is almost nothing :c)Rank: B (7,1/10)			",61,6,7,14,5,0,6

												I just spent two and a half hours driving from Chicago to LA along Route 66, obeying speed limits and stopping every now and then to admire the beautiful scenery. Most of the locations in the game have this authentic kind of feeling to them. While the level of detail doesn't match that of GTA V, it's still high enough to make you keep on playing and exploring the vast open map.Apart from that, well, it's a decent multiplayer racing game. The amount of cars to select from isn't exactly whopping, and there is no photo mode to capture the scenery I mentioned earlier. The AI traffic can suddenly take to the skies and Boeing 747's spin around wildly while airborne. But overall, it's an enjoyable experience if you can ignore the servers shutting down every two hours. Hopefully the developers will manage to get rid of that soon.  Simply put, if you liked TDU, NFS:MW, Burnout Paradise, MC:LA and the likes, you will most likely enjoy The Crew as well. You might want to wait for a few weeks before getting it, though.8/10PS: I wouldn't mind an offline mode.			",30,4,3,5,12,0,1

But!I opened all the network ports that i need for the game but still no multiplayer, and google for 2 sec and you see im not the only one!Mirrors not working in a race game is not good!Money system is a joke, get arrested will cast you 400$ but 1 race will get you 3000$ but a new car? How about 160,000$But there are races you can do that will give you 80,000$, i just did one 2 hours ago, yes the race was 2 hours long!I still do recommend this game, its a good game but not for 60$!

												If you’re someone who enjoys a racing game with beautiful, customisable cars, but gets bored of the usual race-to-the-finish-line gameplay, The Crew is what you’re looking for.At first glance, the game seems to lack in its graphics quality, but as you speed through the streets of the United States in over forty main missions, prove yourself in eight different skill types, and swap from all-terrain trucks to exotic sports cars to suit the occasion, you’ll quickly forget about that. And while the game is designed for multiplayer, most of it is just as suitable for single player.Underlying the beautiful gameplay of The Crew is a deep story following Alex Taylor as he joins the FBI to take vengeance on the leader of a nation-wide underground motor club named the 5-10s. As he travels from state to state, he recruits friends to help him rise through the ranks of the criminal organisation.The multiplayer game features five distinct car specifications; you’ll find yourself teaming up with friends and other online players to weave through the streets of New York in your Street car, drifting on dirt roads in your Dirt spec, racing down Route 66 in your Performance supercar, taking down rivals in your Raid truck, and hugging the racing line of designated tracks in your exotic Circuit spec.However, you’ll find that the game has its fair share of drawbacks. The first few missions, which are completed in your Street car, are quite short and hence less rewarding. Once you move onto Performance, the races will become much lengthier, allowing the pace to ramp up to frantic speeds as you narrowly dodge traffic on windy highways.The rubber-banding is also definitely lacking; if your car is too levelled up in late-game, the other AI racers will fall behind in the first stretch, and the distance will grow as the race progresses. This isn’t an issue during multiplayer, when you can focus on beating your friend – but when you’re playing alone, it often feels like more of a cruise than a race.On top of that, don’t expect the police chases to be too challenging. While this isn’t the game’s main feature, this is one aspect that could have been implemented much better. I’ve found myself too easily losing track of the cops because they can’t keep up, and this takes away from the enjoyment of having the police hot on your heels while drifting around the block.While the game can definitely be enjoyed in single player, I would recommend grabbing a few friends and hitting the roads. If none of your friends are crazy for a racing game (or, alternatively, if you have no friends…), you can join up with whoever’s online around the world to give yourself a better challenge. Either way, The Crew is a truly enjoyable game for the story-driven gamers looking for varied gameplay.			",80,17,1,17,8,2,24

												When it comes to open-world racing games, this is one you'll at least want to try. The story is pretty boring and as generic as it gets, and the selection of cars seems somewhat random, but let me tell you where this game shines the brightest; the open world. Ubisoft has managed to take the entire country of The United Sattes, and shrink it down and put it into a racing game. The car customization is pretty good if you are looking to make your car the way you want. The performance tuning isn't wonderful, mainly just a ""this piece is a higher level than this one so it's better for your car"" but that being said, at least it has actual car parts to upgrade (tires, suspension, gearbox, etc.) instead of just upgrade speed or handling. But like I said early, where this game shines is in the open-world exploration. It has dynamic and chaning environments with rain and day/night cycles, a vast variety of landscapes raning from the tropical florida keys, to the big NYC, the snowy mountains of the northern rockies, the dry deserts of the southwest, and the beautiful coast line of California. And taking a large road trip in your favorite custom car and exploring the world is one of the best things I've done in a video game before.There are plenty of side activities and challenges to do, and plenty of fantastic roads to explore and drive on. If you are looking for an open-world exploration game with car customization and racing, this is the game for you.			",111,4,3,7,2,2,4

												Great game,almost flawless for is kind. Game runs smooth at highest settings 1080-1440p with 1-4 years old hardware. Minor bugs/glitch found just 1 to tell the truth is sometimes the map while driving stop generating so you need to press the button to get back to the road to be able to continu or you will be stuck in the void. Graphics are good mostly environment is not repetitive or anything,from big cities to small towns going thru deserts,mountains,canyons,forests and even swamp. Gameplay wise if you like to drive,you will drive until your knees hurts. The only big issue in this game is...sadly...the word Ubisoft. For some people the name Ubisoft is a problem because they are not perfect and most people don't know how to update bios,drivers or have a good pc and keep it clean of stupid junk that makes them run slow. Than there's games like Watch Dogs that didn't look like the previews...well i never had issues with watch dogs and it worked fine on my hardware. My opinion might worth what all other unknown people does but mine is from an serious Adult being so... Enjoy a good arcade racing mmo open world game because there's not that many of them.

												This is about the funnest game i've ever played! Huge open world. Fun to go on road trips and explore with friends and the racing is really good. I've seen a lot of reviews where people say the handling is sluggish? I don't think that people get for 1. Car handling can be adjusted in options and 2. You have to level up your ride and unlock better parts and your ride between them 2 actually becomes very good. The driving physics are actually extremely good. People just don't take the time to figure these things out. I would say if you want to be apart of a huge open map in a Racing MMO this game is AMAZING!!			",11,1,1,4,3,1,1
