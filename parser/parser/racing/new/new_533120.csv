Early Access Review
								I was really hoping for something outlandoushly strange considering the adorably cruddy art style, but now after competion, I felt extremely stupid for thinking that this would be anything more than a scam with 12 year old offensive comedy. There's that ol' saying that this is a joke get over it, but playing through the game, nothing was funny and by the climax of this mercfully 2-hour ride, I was not buying into this adam sandler quality spoof on a very old GTA game. It can't even be close to riffing off anything from Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and instead goes for replicating a NOTGAMES product in 3D, except there was fun in their version of a GTA parody. Every bad game design troph is here, coded over with the excuse that ""it's a joke"". The worst part of this game is actually it's release. These jokers had a release date of November 29th, only to switch to early access and have thier friends immediately vote this game up. I won't waste my time writing an article on why this game sucks or why these devs are super shadey, but I had to throw down brief thoughts to  quickly counter these fake reviews! Do not fall in and buy this crud!			",225,32,2,18,7,0,5

+ As a GTA Vice City Parody, this game can be quite entertaining at first glance. The city is extremely primitive looking with some pretty amusing child-like drawn textures.+ Some characters have a picture of a face in front of their head as if the developers were too lazy to model an actual head. LOL+ Certainly good for a few laughs here and there - The absolute worst voice acting (at least in English).  This game was made by Russians, and if you choose to play in English  you can tell that they have absolutely no understanding for the language. - The story does not make any sense whatsoever, and it was very hard to even understand what the characters were even talking about.- Gameplay is awful... and mainly consists of driving around a car and very basic shooting scenes with pretty poor controls.

								I got a coupon for this game so it didn't really cost me anything. The one thing this game delivers on is being a gta parody, and not even a good one. A parody can only go so far. Graphicaly everything looks like it was made in ms paint. The camera just likes to do whatever it wants and the controls are terrible. All the dailogue is done poorly and is very uninteresting. In my personal opinion this game is a heaping pile of steaming turds in every way. I am amazed at how high the reviews are for something that's barely even a game. It's like something that someone handed in for a school project and got a D- on.			",157,71,1,16,19,1,21

								I only got it because of a coupon and bought it out of strange curiousity. Now I really wish that this game excluded English so that I would have absolutely no reason whatsoever as to even trying it. Fine, the humor is exclusive, and I did have a sensible chuckle every once in a while, but this is just bad. I will give credit, they have been fixing bugs for the last few months and the game functions, so that's something. It isn't worth the time to even do some research about why this meme filled parody is enjoyed to a certain crowd, just move on and play something else.			",234,37,1,12,14,0,12

								Bad GTA is bad. A satire attempt at a sandbox game, but with its wonkey graphics and sluggish gameplay, I cant really hate on this title. It knows its bad, it makes note of this multiple times. I take it this game was nothing more than a love letter to mindless questers and random hubs from the open world games of yesteryear. It has mechanics, music, voice work, objective points and a small hub world to sudeo-explore. Nothing much in the content portion but again, it is a bad GTA to be a bad GTA. Badge supported and steam achievements included. It was cheap, cute and silly. A nice visit.			",618,151,7,54,30,3,63

								To adress all the people who expected good graphics and gameplay from this game (And give the game negative reviews):""Are you...Are you being serious? You didn't see the screenshots or a youtube video with those two balls on your head that you call ""eyes""?!""Now to the review:Do I recommend the game? If you got a coupon and the game is 0.30, Yes I do!If you are expecting some good gameplay, then don't buy the game.I liked the game because the humor was based on russian stereotypes and I did find it funny (Hey, everyone has preferences) And the game is a parody, so I wasn't expecting much, but what I got was enough to satisfy the 0.30 price tag I payed. It brought me one or two laughs. Although the game is glitchy as hell, I still enjoyed it...			",61,1,0,0,2,0,0

								This game is so bad, but that's what makes this game good.Okay, let's break it down,The game is made by 2 person, you can tell that they are Russians immediately.You can also tell this game is a bad version of GTA.✔ The graphics is okay, it's not good, and not bad either. Texture made by mspaint, and the model is very simple. But that is the point of this game.❌ The game mechanic is very simple, in free roam everyone is a car and no peds, and in mission everyone is human and you shoot other persons and also no cars. You can't get out of the car while in free roam, and can't enter vehicles in mission. You won't be able to hit peoples with car and also cant shoot vehicles on foot, Obviously because there isn't any.❌ Because of that, there is no point/no fun of playing free roam, or playing this game after finishing all mission. Except to start over.✔ Gameplay/Mission is just good, but not good enough, but it's funny, you can finish the game in about 1.5 hours.✔ Soundtrack (even there is only 2 songs I think) is good for indie game.✔ Voice acting is very very very very bad but hilarious, 6 character voiced by only 2. Again, it makes this game good.✔ Sound asset is so funny, if you laugh after driving a car, wait until you fire a handgun and RPG.✔ Does not found any major bug and crash in whole gameplay, ...❌ ... except the ""Free Town"" button (that I think it should be a cancel mission button).This is the kind of WTF IS THIS ♥♥♥♥!? yet I still curious to play it. And I did finish it.How much I like this game score: 7/10, I like itHow much I want to recommend this game score: 6.5/10, give it a try while it's cheap			",65,17,1,4,4,0,3

								The second half of the game's disclaimer reads as follows:""... This game contains crude humor, obscenities, bad English translation, terrible songs and graphics, so we do not reccomend playing this **** to anyone.""The game's CREATORS may not recommend it, BUT I  DO ~! - however -, ONLY for people with a quirky sense of humor who also liked GTA 3.The use of dated styles of graphics combined with the cartoony world make a colorful and unique yet familiar gaming experience, and the storyline is hilarious.Basically like GTA 3 in a cartoon world, which just happens to be in Russia.The game runs smoothly, controls are good.Shootouts are win - able; pretty decent hit detection all around.Overall VCB: WC is a bit challenging, yet fair and playable.

								Writing Review...12/10 Peppa Pigs!Ok, so it's obvious this is a parody (blatant knockoff) of Vice City but in all fairness, it's quite funny and while the missions are very annoying for having to restart from the very beginning when failed. They're easy to learn and finish once you learn the routes. Plus it's no different from any of the old GTA titles in which you had to do the exact same thing. The vehicles do indeed feel clunky but if you can overlook these minor flaws and the fact it uses stolen assets such as Peppa Pig and copyrighted music such as the instrumental from Forgot About Dre, then it is actually quite a fun little game. Very easy to complete and you get a few laughs along the way. :)Ok, now you pay me a lot of money for review. I deserve free key for your game on Steam.			",3514,1346,142,351,516,49,522

								First of all, I want to say, this isn't a game. This is an experience. A Transcendant Experience. I don't know where to start with this absolute masterpiece of a game. I will start with the sound design of VCB. The sound of a game remains one of the most underrated factors of making a good game, and the talented men who created this gem clearly understood this. The Audio Fidelity of this experience is nothing short of amazing. Everything from the cars to the guns sound like they were pulled from real life. This really helps with the immersion, as at times I felt like I was really in the game due to everything I was hearing. The Graphics in Why City are not as impressive as say, The Witcher 3, or Arma 3, or Minecraft, but they still manage to create a vivid, lifelike world for players to explore and enjoy. For an experience created by 2 men, it has incredible graphics compared to even many modern AAA games.While the story of the experience is not as important as other factors, the small 2 man writing team still managed to create a gripping tale of intrigue, romance, and betrayal. The main character Vano is joined by an enigmatic and colourful cast of characters, my favourite of which was the vertically impaired rapper MC ♥♥♥♥er. The story in essense is just an excuse for the gameplay, but regardless it still manages to be interesting and even emotional at times. The Ending made me both laugh and cry.Now for the most important part of any video game, the gameplay. VCB takes inspiration from 3rd person shooters such as Max Payne, True Crime, and maybe even a tiny bit of the Grand Theft Auto Games. The driving is smooth and intuitive, and while there is not a very large selection of vehicles, each one is lovingly crafted to be unique. The gunplay is where VCB truly shines. The wide array of weapons each feel different to use and the difficulty curve is more than reasonable.I feel remiss to give this game less than a solid 10/10, but I feel it is my duty to do so. So, my final rating for this experience is 9.9/10. I took away this tenth of a point as a warning to all potential buyers: This game may make you enjoy other games less. If you are brave enough to take this chance, then I urge you to purchase VCB. At the time of writing this experience costs $2.99, but It is truly worth any price presented. I would go as far as saying that this is the second best game/experience of all time, behind Simpsons: Hit and Run. Truly unparalleled.			",71,13,0,9,4,0,4

								""VCB: Why City"" ReviewWhen I saw a title in the ""New Relases"" section that went by the name of ""VCB: Why City"" in the new releases section, I figured it was just another Grand Tehft Auto knockoff (Lol, you know the kind, Mafia, Jumpix Jump, Watch Dogs, Witcher, Sleeping Dogs, Saints Row, Skyrim, Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Morrowind). But, I did a double take when I learned that this game was a parody of the open world genre! And a great parody it is! The biting satire and wit present in this game's story and dialogue would make Jon Swift himself salivate. If you're not into ironic humor, than go play one of those humourless (like Borderlands, for example!) Lol.PROS: + The soundtrack, featuring rappers like MC Poh, provides a strong, steady beat, to match the chaotic rhythm of the epic gunfights and battle sequences. + Though the main protagonist is male, they sneak in a strong woman in Karina, who acts as a comic foil, yet is clearly independent and ambitious with her work as a streamer! + Some jokes push the envelope a little bit (Crude!) But they always do so with a purpose, and will leave even the marble man in ""The Thinker"" giggling.+ Challenging driving and shooting mechanics. The weapon spread is calibrated fantastically!CONS:- Fat shaming. There's been too much fat shaming in games, and as a man who is a bit portly (but healthy), I do tend to take offence to these ""jokes"". Though our weight may be high, we make up for it in heart. Micro-aggressions and punching down. - There are a few jokes about People of Size. PoS's like myself already take a beating in popular culture—why carry it on into the virtual world. ""The Media"" treats us bad enough.- I wouldn't let my child play this game. I don't have one, but I'd start him off on an educational game first!All in all, this game nails it. For the price, you can't beat it! Three dollars for a great work of satire. These Russians sure know how to make a game! Maybe I'll visit Moscow and ask them for some tips : - ) (I'm working on becomeing a programmer!) Anyways, Loveing This Game.9.1/10A Dave 2003 Review ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Skill Incarnates Gaming Channelhttps://www.youtube.com/c/SkillIncarnateTwitter:https://twitter.com/skillincarnateVCB Why City On Steam================================================You will walk in shoes of usual guy named Vano that returns to his hometown to conquer it again and help his old friends with their many problems. Haters make an attempt on Karina the streamer's life, genius rapper MC Heck still doesn't have a girlfriend and the game called VCB, made by legendary Kirill and Mihan, is littered with bad feedbacks on Steam. All these problems are yours now.There will be a whole city at your service, with its surprising sights and precious transport. There will be a work with burrito delivery-boy, helping with video for cool rap-singer MC Heck, intimacy with sweetie pie Karina and also not letting famous game video-blogger Anton sue Kirill and Mihan for his burlesque image in game VCB!It's a real game for next generation, made with the most advanced technology. It will surprise you by unusual characters, sudden twists and turns and truly impressive game world! Conquer that city! Show it who the boss is!Game budget is 1 trillion dollars (maybe, African), so you won't find a game as quality as that one!Game features:Advanced physics of weapon and carsUnbelievable detailing (4K textures)Exciting diverse gameplayMusic by acknowledged stars of all timeCharismatic characters sounded by professionals			",291,25,1,49,21,0,55

								Guys. This game it is awesome. It is... Like GTA, but without opportunity to get out the car. You may not understand this game if you are not russian, so did not I, due to I'm not russian. But this graphics and this whole minimalistic and sarcastic design make me play this masterpiece over and over again (it's only one hour gameplay, but it worth it). Humor - 7/10, Camera - 8/10, gamplay - 9/10, music - 228/10 (MC Pokh = one love).The greatest thing about this game is opportunity to take part in its creation. So, some advice to creators:- Как вылазить из машины, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥?- В сюжет вставьте плиз Ваномаса, че за игра без Ваномаса?- Побольше МС Поха.- Пригласите еще актеров озвучки, желательно Петра Гланца...А так идея нормальная, ребят, дерзайте, развивайтесь, творите, слушайте батьков российского игропрома, удачи вам.Не зря отдал 78 рублей. 7/10			",26,6,0,2,1,0,1

								Весёлая игра, хотя технически ей есть куда стремиться. В открытом мире нельзя выходить из машины, плохо реализована стрельба, иногда игра зависает, местами скучные миссии. Тем не менее, очень прикольная идея, интересно даже на загрузочные экраны посмотреть ;)			",26,4,0,0,0,0,1
