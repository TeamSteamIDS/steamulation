												It was a great game, however it has a lot of technical issues and I can't recommend you buy it. The Steam version is the same as the one on GOG, so don't expect that one to be any different. Both are at version 1.1 (the menu will say 1.0, this has always been the case, the patch never changed that number, so ignore it, and ignore all the people in the forum thinking they have to install the patch. That does nothing.)The game's level design is pretty bad, but otherwise it was a fun FPS that also had decent car combat (and every car had an interior camera view!). It was fun blowing up bad guys into red chunks, and the way your weapon would transform into different versions was very cool. The animation for turning your assault rifle into a buzzsaw or sniper rifle was always entertaining.Sadly, as I said, the game has a ton of issues currently. I was able to get it running on Windows 10 (though a lot of people in the forum can't get it to run at all. I did nothing special, so I have no idea why others are having issues getting it to launch), however you cannot change the resolution any higher than 1280x1024, the framerate is capped at 30fps, there's no way to increase the extremely small FOV, and if you use one of the fanmade patches to get a higher resolution (I was able to get it to launch at 1920x1080) the game will not run through Steam. Hence why it says I've only put a handful of minutes in the game.Among other smaller issues is that the mouse will go wonky in some menus, slowing to a stuttering crawl, making it very hard to change keybindings and graphic settings. The soundtrack is screwed up and every single level starts with the same loud song (track02, which you can find under the Bonus Content folder), which plays for about 2 minutes and then stops. It doesn't play any of the other 8 songs this game has, it doesn't loop that one song, it just.. stops.That one song will begin playing once a cutscene starts, too, so if you haven't turned it off (it's the ""CD Audio"" setting) then you'll have an impossible time trying to hear any of the characters.If you don't mind playing with no music, a tiny resolution, mouse issues, and the often crashes, then it's a fun game. The level design is, as I said, kind of awful, and you'll get lost a good bit of the time. But the weapons are fun, the vehicles handle nicely, each one has an interior view, and the characters are pretty goofy and entertaining, especially whoever voiced Bork. Goodness, that voice.Anyway, I can't recommend it, it's too buggy. Not even for the $0.97 it's currently at. I hope that this game sooner or later gets an official patch to fix at least a handful of the issues I've mentioned, but until then just play something else. You aren't missing too much. This is an entertaining, but altogether forgettable game.If you really need some Redline in your life, why not just listen to some good ol' King Kobra?

Charismatic Liddy, boss of the Company - the gang our protagonist joins in the beginning. Rant singing Kumbaya. Four rival gangs - each with their own flavor. And all of these set in a pretty good-looking post-apocalyptic wasteland. Maaaan, do i miss the 90s.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a 3d FPS Game.It's a great game from the 1999 Era.Must say graphics look pretty amazing for a old game like this.Controls feel a little cheap ♥♥♥.......It's a game with some driving and gore.I personally think there are better games out there from that time.Like Unreal, Quake, Duke Nukem, Doom and so on.It's fun game to have and play for some while.I give it a 6.5 out of 10.

												⚠ DOES NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS 8.1 or 10For Win 8.1: The game is very laggy, particularly after going to the options menu. And there's a horrid clipping glitch, where textures are all over the place and covers most of the screen. Also, about 10% of the time, the game crashes immediately after starting. I contacted Retroism, the company that owns this game, and they said running it in compatibility mode for Windows 98/Windows Me has fixed lag for SOME people, so if you're having issues, that's worth a try. It didn't help with me though, and unfortunately I'm not alone. I also tried compatibility mode for Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8 with no luck.For Win10: The game will not open, period. A popup comes up and it say ""Wheels has stopped."" Windows 10 isn't optimized to play most old games though, so be careful what you buy.I don't blame the devs though, it's not their fault. Old games like this are meant to be played on older softwares. I'm sure this game is badass though, I didn't refund it (I got it on sale for $1, that's actually how I heard of Redline), and I hope to eventually see a fix!			",206,25,0,11,4,3,2

												did you like mad max, quake 2, and gory shooters?  you'll love this game!  the story is simple, you work for a group called ""the company"" fighting other groups to keep dominance on the outside desert world.  The story is alright, nothing new or intersting with B movie voiceovers, the shooting is fine, controls are a bit wonky (i'd reccomend default 2 for best control), and the art style is really nice to look at; even with the blocky graphics (1998 people).

												This is one of those games where if you say something negative about it, some dude who has never upgraded his computer since 1998 will try to fight you because ""the game is too complex for modern gamers!"". Well, this game isn't too complex, it just sucks. Plain and simple, it sucks. The controls on foot feel like you are playing as Sonic the Hedgehog with an adderal addiction. The controls in your car aren't any better, the physics just don't feel right, it's hard to describe. The music is awful, there is only ONE SONG that only plays once at the beginning of levels and cutscenes, and never again. Overall, the game is garbage, don't buy. Unless it's on sale for less than a dollar, then buy it just to laugh at the voice acting.			",133,16,1,17,13,0,18

It's nearly imposible to change the settings, and the normal layout for movement are the arrow-keys.It ruins the whole game, that and needing to use a 3rd party mod for higher res optionsI'd recommend the game if there were plans on a patch for modern os'. but the devs say nope and this game is only tested and working on win 98 and xp even if you can get it to work on other os's you will have issues NOTE: this is one of those many games that is in a special box of THIS WILL NEVER WORK AGAIN due to modern MS os's not adding any type of VM builds for older os supported codecs or wrappers etc. due to win 7 8 and 10 about 80% of old games using windows WONT ever work, unless its a dos game say goodbye old games DON'T BUY IT. EVEN WHEN IT'S ON SALE. 1/10 to quote a friend who made a recent review.stay far far away, and when you see ANY game in steam stores that say win 7 or + when its made in the 90's DONT BELIEVE IT unless the devs have patched it, which most devs are defunct (luckily this dev isnt but they have NO PLANS on updates)frankly they are shocked that steam/valve is selling this in the store as win vista or 7 compatible, according to the devs win 98 se and xp is required. + glide wrappppers galore.kiss old games goodbye as MS keeps ignoring old windows games ",875,356,9,120,53,5,78

												Redline is a unique combat driving/fps hybrid. Both the fps and the combat driving elements control great and feel good. But I strongly recommend remapping the controls. The first 9 levels (out of 12) are well designed and the combat works well. The gameplay in these levels are well paced with proper incrementing difficulty. But the last three levels of the game are very glitchy and overly difficult (which is not retroism or night dive's fault). I spent a few hours trying to finish the last three levels due to saving and door glitches, as well as the overly difficult level Area 51 (the part with the aliens). The first nine levels alone are worth playing and worth the money. I would welcome a reboot. 8/10			",496,136,19,44,52,3,65

												***Don't buy it at 6.99. I am reviewing the game for what it is, ignoring that gouging price tag completely. There are 99 cent games with more replayability and fun than Redline, even a skin on Dota 2 would net you more joy than this***Redline is probably the greatest game to have come out on January 1st, 1999.You drive cars with physics that are neck-breaking at best, but they have more variety and challenge to them than Borderlands has ever offered. The gunplay is absolutely terrible, with one-gun-fitting-all and very little use for the sniper rifle... Or machine gun, or grenades, or the saw-thing, but ya kinda end up using all of them at one point or another. It's a little hard, even for a seasoned FPS veteran, and I'd stay away if you weren't playing for the nostalgia value, butat the end of the day, it's something to play on a rainy day, and it's a small challenge. I probably won't ever even end up finishing it, it's got 20 missions too many, is terribly linear, but if you want to see what good car firefights are, go no further than this game.
