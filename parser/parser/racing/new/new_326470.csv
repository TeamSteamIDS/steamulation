												Fun, although very repetitive, could have used varying backgrounds, mechanics, and level designs. Fun how you learn about the universe though. No real story. 7/10.			",452,80,11,25,16,6,21

												God damn radiation zones.The graphics aren't bad, the concept makes no sense, but it's a game, so it doesn't have too. It's a puzzle game about dragging planets through a course of hazards without touching the walls (which are deemed as radiation zones). The game's inertia mechanic drives me insane, though I'd imagine it adds to the challenge as to when to stop dragging and when to pull back (I'm just not particularly good at it). You'll have obstacles to drag your planet through, and turning and changing the direction of the planet is something you'll have to do carefully unless you're good at it. Judging from the trailer, further on in the game, different mechanics are introduced and add more challenge to the game. It does a have a neat little feature that shows you your previous runs in that level as you're doing it again, in real time. You can also watch someone else's playthrough in comparsion to your own via the leader boards. I only played the tutorial levels, but I realized the game wasn't for me. It seems like it'd be great for speed runners or people who like trying to get the ""best times"" in such games. If you enjoy these concepts, then give the game a bash.I'm not reccomending it based on my own tastes, but I could see why some people would enjoy it.			",3016,1209,118,322,420,38,485

												This is a very good game! For those who like Physics games, and those who like games that need quick reflexes, this combines the best of both worlds! Pretty much the point of the game is to get Earth to the goal, while navigating through space, by warping space. BUT, it's not that easy. There are objects which will slow you down, speed you up and many more. Good thing this game is filled with facts and is based on true facts, not made-up space stories. To see what the game is actually like when playing it, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1ccVsCdM0 ",95,25,4,9,6,2,9

												(I was going to do a video review of this, but then lost interest...)Space Warp is one of those games you play to fill time, usually while you are waiting for a bus, or already on a bus... let's just call it a ""bus game"".The premise is that the Earth has once again entered one of it's natural states in games, being in big trouble. Not an entirely new or original situation to be fair, but not one commonly done with this genre. Anyways, the Earth is in danger of being microwaved by space radiation and it is up to you to steer the Earth to safety by bending space and time in a 2D environment stricken with a kind of gellatinous radioactive jelly often found in the back of student dorm refridgerators, which kindly creates neat little passageways for your suddenly mobile Earth to steer through, in 2D, to the safe zone of each level... in 2D.If I seem hung up on the 2D aspect of this, it is for a good reason. Space is very infrequently represented well in 2D. Much in the same way I do not like 2D mining games, 2D space games need to have a LOT of fantastic gameplay to compensate for cutting out an entire dimension before I can begin to feel like I haven't been ripped off.Space Warp does not have fantastic gameplay. It is what you would expect from the marble-maze genre (yes I made that up). It does it's job but the theme chosen, while only slightly more original than ""get ball to hole"", having a space theme with no real 3D or more exciting gameplay cripples the game a bit for me. There is some tight programming in there, the graphics are nice, it all works well and feels good, but there isn't much more here to offer non-fans of similar, casual bus games. So all-in-all, not for me, but recommended to try it if you enjoy maze games or are stuck on a 12 hour bus journey.			",219,36,1,20,28,2,39

												Space Warp is a very fun and challenging arcade game. Essentially a puzzle game, you have to move the Earth through tight spaces, moving dead zones, and other traps. The game has online leaderboards and while each level is short, they keep you going since you want to get that better score.			",2533,1063,103,328,347,26,430

												This game is one of those games that are ""hard to control"", unless you enjoy that kinda game, I would not recommend this.The tough part? The damn globe's stupid ♥♥♥♥♥ inertia of course, you need to time where you should counter your move to stop the ♥♥♥♥♥ globe from banging anything.Price is reasonable... Anyway the pros and consPros:+Leaderboards, get fast enough, and your name gets to pop on world record, and ppl get to see how u wasted ur time breaking it+Decent graphicCons:-Well, Cant thought of anything for now.

												It's a physics game that you pull the earth in orbit. The biggest challenge is trying to go faster while compensating for inertia, so you can beat your friends or get your name on a list of records.I'm sure there are people who would enjoy this style of game, but it's not my thing.Steam needs to add a third recommend option for ""on the fence""			",657,182,25,71,49,4,46
