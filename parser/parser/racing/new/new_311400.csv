												UninstalledWas looking forward to this game, especially after the size of the download and that it needs a fairly high spec PC to run it, as it stutters on my laptop and has a patch for lower end PCs at their website (or it's just bad programming as it doesn't look any better than most cheap games out there). Anyway played it on my main gaming PC. Not many graphics options to tweak in the menu so onto the game.The open world part is poor, nothing to do except walk around getting into different cars. Anyway I gave it another chance and decided to try the racing competition mode. 4 cars racing around a city track following the arrows to help guide your way..or so I thought. The arrows was sending me round in a circle, one minute I was in first place well clear of the other cars the next minute I was in last place half of a lap behind! The problem was the course used the same parts of the track twice so the arrows was sending me in the wrong direction. Resetting the car didnt help, all this seems to do is position you next to the nearest arrow which can be from an earlier part of the track. and don't get me onto the handling of the cars or the collision mechanics of this game..awful. Also it seems the devs have mostly left this game unfinished. Just avoid it			",221,26,41,3,10,1,11

												Normally I wouldn't feel so inclined to write a review on a game like this. The screenshots in the forum and the ratings speak for themselves. However, it would seem that the devs don't want the screenshots to give a bad impression of their game.Any screenshots from the older, non 'redux' version are actively being banned from the community, irrespective of whether or not they break any rules. Looking past the scumminess of this is the fact that getting your screenshots banned will get you banned from uploading any more screenshots for a period of time. The more they take down, the longer the ban is.With that being said, I wouldn't recommend this game anyway. The world is pretty small, the physics are wonky at best, and a lot of the objects and sounds that make up the world can be found for free in an asset store. There isn't much to be found here. You can find much better uses for $2.99 in my opinion.			",492,85,38,70,46,5,71

												Pros:- Music is good.Cons:- Everything else.I really liked the idea this game was going for. What I found was probably one of the most credible successors for Big Rigs. There is no car damage, you can pop off some lamp posts and that's it. Only things happening when you crash are either flying around, spinning or knocking back like crazy with no real penalty. Calling controls arcade-like would be extremely generous, but they are just stiff and cars don't really turn around like you want to. Music is kinda good but most of the time its so upbeat it only adds to comedy value of the game.There are three main modes to speak of. Time trial is what it is, if you are masochistic enough to master controls of this game. Race mode has some CPU opponents you can push around like they have zero weight. There is no multiplayer. Lastly there is free roam where you can explore the map which takes 10 minutes tops, run through pedestrians and use handful cars available to you. There's many kinds of cars parked but you can't use most of them. You also have a jump that doesn't seem to have any purpose other than fooling you to think you can get over some fences and stuff. Nope. Most fun thing I found was driving on the ocean floor. Yeah.It is sad to see some effort definitely went into this. All in vain. Also worth mentioning is that the engine is very heavy considering what the game looks like. You can tweak it up a little since its straight up Unreal 3. Or should I say you can try. I even ran out of video memory which is legendary. I didn't find a way to rebind controls. I tried because I didn't like the preset.To sum it all up: don't buy this game if you want a good racing game. If you want to cry or laugh, I think you should actually buy this! It is very cheap and can make you laugh if you are one of those into bad games. Definitely has also educational value for game developers everywhere.			",494,151,16,70,53,4,106

 OCEAN CITY RACING REVIEW  First of all I'd like to start off by saying that this game is very unpolished, and unfinished. Throughout the  HOUR of gameplay I put into this game, I fell through the map a total of 6 times. I dont know if this game is abandon-ware left by the developer, or whether it's being worked on for it's faults. Pro's: The game has a vast majority of cars for you too use in the game.           The driveable car's physics are decent at most. ANNNNDD NOW THE CON'S  there's a lot of them Con's: The graphics for this game are awful, really poor and shameful to look at.This game feels like a really crappy mobile port too pc, since there are no graphical options whatsoever. {except for resolution etc.}The physics for the  NON DRIVEABLE CARS  are laughable, absolutely terrible. There is this motion blur that is really annoying that you can't turn off, and even if you move in the slightest, it'll show up and be annoying. The car's are basically all the same, they just have different looks, but they all accelerate the same, go the same speeds, and some even have the same present sounds for their engine. The A.I. for the races are absolutely terrible, they drive into walls, and can't steer straight through the track. Character Modeling for this game is almost Nonexistent because of the same NPC's that walk the street. there are a total of like, 4-5 different NPC's. who are very low res, who for some reason stand at 7 feet tall, (taller than your character, when you leave the car)THE GAME IS VERY UNPOLISHED. In free-roam, you can drive around in an open world, the map is very small, and kind of linear when you think about it. there are invisible walls, almost everywhere, and sometimes even floors that you can fall through the world with. I've actually fell off the side of the map, Literally walked too the end, and jumped off. The Free-Roam map is also unfinished, with a bridge that has a construction site on it, too even parts of the map that you can see in the distance with no ground. this map is full of surprises.Would I recommend this game? NO. It is an Unpolished, Unfinished product of an open world racing game for lowend pc's that doesn't even run well. if you want a good open world racing game, your best bets are Need For Speed, or even Forza Horizon. 3/10 Because I slightly enjoyed uninstalling it.

												Ocean City Racing is an indie racing game, made in the UT3 engine. The game feels and plays like an old arcade race game made by SEGA. Whenever you crash into other cars or buildings you car stays intact. You could destroy things like small fences but whenever you ride into a pedestrian your car just stops. I know this is no carmageddon but perhaps there should not have been npc's in a game like this. The cars also have some unnatural physics. It would have been nice if you could play the game with a controller but mine did not seem to work.There are 3 game modes: Time-Trial, Race Mode and Free Roam. Obviously, Time-Trial is to beat your own times, Race-Mode is just racing opponents and Free-roam is driving around an 'open world' city.The graphics are not that special these days but they are not that bad. The city looks OK but I doubt anyone plays this game for sight-seeing. Although not my taste, the music is pretty good however, totally not suited for a race game, in my opinion.Without any achievements, online leaderboards or online/offline multiplayer, the game will most likely bore you after max 1 hour. Even though the game is cheap, I still can't recommend this one. ",1619,636,54,225,180,17,281

												Oh boy. I just keep finding ways to get impressed. At a retail price of $3, Ocean City Racing (well, OCEAN CITY RACING, but I think you'll forgive me if drop the caps) is a pretty cheap buy, but as a lover of racing games I'll give almost anything a try. It doesn't always go well, like Redneck Racing or Motorama, and Ocean City Racing is stacking up to be another mistake languishing in my library.The game already fails on a technical level with a barebones options menu, offering an extremely limited resolution choice—not even offering my native resolution of 1600x900, the third most common resolution by Steam's hardware survey—no graphics options, no volume sliders, no rebindable controls...it's just a mess. And the game runs terribly and looks worse, with a massively overdone motion blur to boot that makes it more or less impossible to see what you're doing. Of course, as mentioned, there is no way to turn this off. Additionally, all the button prompts given are for keyboard controls, so anyone who wants to play with a controller will find themselves randomly pressing buttons to try to figure things out if they didn't memorize the controls from the options menu.The car handling is utter garbage. You have very little control and will find yourself bumping off walls left and right. Conveniently there's a reset car button that doesn't seem to have much penalty, so I think this was expected. The handbrake button has been replaced by a spin out button, leading to further resets. The boost fails to give any real feeling of speed, but nonetheless makes the car all the more likely to go out of control in corners, adding yet more usefulness to the reset button unless you save it for straights. And of course there's the random physics bugs where a tap against a wall can send you flying into the air. And despite all this bumping around and lost time, the computers have it even worse; I watched them crash on their own all over the place. They don't know how to play this game any better than I do! I had an atrocious time but still somehow came in second in my first race.So, after the disaster of a race, I decided I would try free roam mode. You walk around in a first-person camera and can't interact with anything but the cars. You drive around a little more freely which leads to a little bit less bumping around, but the driving still feels terrible, the game still looks like someone dumped Vaseline on it, you still randomly get launched into the air, and there doesn't seem to really be any point to doing any of this.It was at this point I realized I had about all I could take of this game and decided to try collecting my thoughts together into words. That really is all there is to it: nothing in this game inspires me to play it, and on both technical and design fronts it actively discourages me from playing. There was not one moment when playing this game that I thought to myself ""I had fun,"" and for that I cannot recommend this game for any reason.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I regretted my purchase when I noticed the npcs wearing meme shirts and I couldn't run them over. >:^(2.1/10This is the first review I feel I need to bring more clarification to when it comes to not recommending this. Read on if you so desire.This game features one of the worst handling and physics I've ever experienced. Of course this is something that's not comfortable on my part and might be something good for someone else, but judging the major dislikes on this game, I don't think I need to feel alone.They've inserted 'easter eggs' for you to find, when in reality the only real easter eggs are the bugs and glitches that come out of the game and oh boy are there a TON of bugs and glitches.. oh wait did I say easter eggs? They aren't a secret at all..The optimisation for this game is beyond terrible.. oh and when you rely on memes from around 2010 to hide the game's flaws, you're absolutely being preposterous. Come the hell on, we're at the end of 2014 here. I may have never liked these 'memes' in the first place, but even now these things are as dead as a dead horse who's already vanished due to it's rotting process. (And yes, you can not run them over. Some clip through your car like ghosts, and some are as hard as titanium, they don't budge at all.)I've got this game for the full price. Even these 3 euro's were too much for something like this. With the money I'd rather buy Bad Rats.I hope this extra additional info helps out on improving insight, but I'm never touching this game again. but I might give it another shot if they improve the handling and physics, fix the horrendous flaws in the game, expand the land and start basing their comedy on something that's actually fitting in the recent gaming communities. Don't get your hopes up though, I doubt it'll ever happen.. ",161,17,17,14,13,2,29

												Well for one no need to judge me for my playtime because that is all i could play after roaming half the map in free-mode with this horrid car mechanics and flawed physics it is better to drive around in GMOD the one thing i was hoping to drive the moped didn't even work even though it sits there at the start of free-mode. I really am hoping no one ever has to play the half finished excuse of a game it felt like a failed demo the only decent thing was the soundtrack which i'm not going to judge because the artist are ok and i'm sure you could find the music somewhere else. Do not buy this unless your willing to waste money to see how bad this really is. 3/10 because it will be 3$ out of $10 in your wallet wasted.PS: This game would be great for kids to play on since it's non violent and the physics are so bad it's amusing but for gamers i would not recommend as i think it has no playable value for 3$ you could spend that 3$ on other games or maybe even a DLC.

												I don't understand how anybody can make a game these days and not allow you to change the key bindings. We don't all do WSAD. The default buttons on a controller make absolutely no sense either, down to go forward? Game is unplayable to me for this reason. Too bad, looks like a fun game otherwise. Kinda choppy, I think one needs a better computer than system requirements would have you believe. If the developer decides to add customizable controls, I will jump back in the game, but right now I just can't.			",48,9,7,5,15,0,4

Product received for free
												I got this as a free gift from GreenManGaming.com I was not here during the whole banned picture fiasco. All I knew about the game is what it shows on the intro videos. Based on that, I thought I'd try it as I am in the mood for a racer. I was let down.PROS: The cars and graphics in general look good... with issues The music is good (thanks to Kevin MacLeod's royalty free music for that) For the most part the cars handle wellCONS: The cars and buildings off to the side away from the track look horrible. Very blocky, octagaonal wheels


Bad models 
A Screenshot of OCEAN CITY RACING: Redux
By: Resonant Drifter




 The graphical glitches can be horrible (I read the Nvidia post. I put it in windowed mode) The city feels like it's a bunch of models just laid out, not like a real city. Some things are destructible (fire hydrant, light posts, signs) and some aren't (people, tables, trash cans, some trees, construction sign). Some invisible walls for no reason like an invisible wall blocking on open gate leading into a parking lot near the beginning of the free roam starting point. You can get in by following a ""hallway"" walking towards the tree, but can't drive in there. The cars feel a bit too easy to wipe out just by turning. No mini-map to see how far ahead the other racers are or what turns are coming up No stats on vehicles or selection screen. The cars feel too much alike. There is basic AI. Free roam drivers just plow through things as if they weren't there. People on the street just stand there (of course, they can't get hurt). The only AI that seem competent is the racers.Overall, it feels like a half-hearted affair. It would be good, and I guess they have been working on it, but until they start filling in the small details this game will always feel like it's unfinished.			",130,72,0,27,6,0,9

												Do you know Ocean City? Are you down with Ocean City? Are you for real? Really real? Really really...really....really real REAL? Then maybe you should play this game. It's illegal street racing at its finest as you get behind the wheel of the sexiest imports. We're talking borsches, hamborghinis, ataris, and go-karts. Each of the 10 races features chills, spills, and speeds that'll leave you wearing adult diapers.You wanna know how extreme it can get? Some of these courses are designed so that racers will get in head-on collisions! Can you believe that? I certainly can't, and I just experienced it firsthand. The races are twisted because everyone, is you, and you, are everybody. Is that deep or what? It's like you've just had this psychotic breakdown and now you're racing cars with your selves. Even if you can't grasp the handling, don't worry, because your competitors are worse drivers than you are. Ocean City is bad news. I mean yeah it looks alright, but the people are just...wow. I mean I'm just a generic guy with a goatee and cold dead eyes, but at least I don't look like Odo from Deep Space 9. It's like whoever modeled this game thought ""we don't need pedestrians that resemble humans, but we have to make sure they're wearing meme t-shirts. That is the most important thing."" Either that, or everyone was too focusing on delivering the ultimate racing experience. I'm guessing it was the latter.........Alright I've had enough fun.Truth is, this isn't a good racing game. It's definitely incomplete, should probably spend several months in the oven, and level 3 needs far more than just its graphics tightened up. I had fun with it though, more fun than I've had with numerous polished videogames. I'm a big fan of open-world driving games like Burnout Paradise, Test Drive Unlimited, and the Crash Time games. Simply being able to goof off and get stupid with expensive-looking automobiles is perpetual entertainment to me.I'm actually worried that eventually the developers of this game will fix it. It'll be complete, well-designed, and yet, something will be lost. I like making all the weird discoveries, such as finding the burger king ads, pedestrians more disturbing and with creepier animations than the last, and new ways to flip my car. Eventually all that might get taken away, and I'll be sad.Not a good game, but it's fun, and that's all that matters?			",914,265,35,107,34,4,37

												This game is trying to be something its not. First of all, I do not belive for a second this was made on unreal engine for the fact that Dishonored was made on the same engine and is 10x better than this crap. I have put in an hour of misery and hate to this game just to be here typing this reveiw saying how buggy it is. ITS REALLY BUGGY. If I look one way and the shadows are completely fine, why if i look in the other way the shader go completely mad. Not to mention the lack of psyhcis and driving feel. I like how they tried to make it so you can walk around but thats really a lie because if i dont put something good in this review I will become a downer.

												This game is absolutely terrible.Do not recommend to anyone, ever, this game is broken beyond repair.The car models look alright but the rest of the animations are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and blurry. Characters sit it blocky postures like robots. Steering wheel doesn't even turn. No smoke effects when braking, Lack of cars and variation. All cars go the same speed and sound identical.  Maps all small and minimum effort has been put into them. I bought this game thinking I got a bargain I mean 3 dollars! Thats amazing -_- NOPE! Chuck testa. This game is absolute ♥♥♥♥ and for the tiny amount of content you get its worth arounnd 70 cents, MAXIMUM. Free roam is a piece of ♥♥♥♥, you can't even access half the cars. When you drive into pedestrians they all of a sudden turn into ghosts. Every building seems to lack an entrance.  Don't even get me started on Race Mode. The drivers are dopy and constantly crash into things (Which you would expect on super easy difficulty. OH WAIT THERE AREN'T EVEN DIFFICULTY LEVELS.) Maps are the same race track over and over just repainted. No story at all. I mean at all! Not even a name of the racer, you just get plopped onto a road and have to try and drive in circles while a bunch of idiots crash into eatchother behind you.   No backstory, what country you are in, why your there, how you got there. Because you can magically teleport. Free roam is just so bad I have to complain twice. Other than a couple of ramps randomly put around the 7 meter long map there is no interaction at all. About 3 npc models.  Animations are messed up so people just wave sit down then stand up and wave then sit down again.  No voice recordings. Every person in Ocean City  is mute and deaf. Oblivious to everything npcs just sit there, or should I say stand there waving and staring in the void.  You can jump! But you can't jump over anything because the characters feet are made of cement and he can only just lift his feet off the ground. Everything is badly designed and blurry. There is no end to race mode. You just do the same race over and over in a different coloured car. -23/10 ~IGN ""Great game, would bang again.""			",86,11,0,6,5,0,1

Cars don't stop or change course when you walk on road. People look bad, the intermittently gliding dog looks bad. People walk then vanish.If you walk up the ramp, it says 'hang time' or something like that.The driving feels horrible.2/10			",554,237,16,50,36,2,34

												Ocean city raicing. Full buyer guide for this gameRacing/Indie game, with killer price tag for only 2.99§ (2.88€) is a Unreal Engine game, made by only one person and still with decent graphics and neat gameplay.This game cannot compete with NFS series or any other AAA+ racing game, but with price tag low as under 5 dollars (Sometimes in sales it can cost around 0.50€) it really can be fun, and relaxing game. in Game you can pick three game modes; Free roam, Time trial and Racing modeFree roam: As name already tells, this mode is only about free roaming on map, nothing specificTime trial: In this mode you compete to pass certain route in certian timeRacing mode: You are racing against AI, they can be dumb sometimes thoPros:+ Price tag+ Relaxing game+ 3 modes to play with+ Decent graphicsCons:- AI- PhysicsOverall, for its price its really decent game, and it sure can be fun to play when you are with friends, sure it cant beat NFS or AAA+ racing titles, but for its price tag it doesnt even try to competeTL;DR:Just buy it for christ sake, its 2.99.

												tl;dr: A game with many flaws and to some, bad quality. But I've had a lot of fun with this game, it just comes down to what you're actually looking for. Want a serious racing sim? Look further. Are you searching for some (although buggy) old-fashioned fun? You might want to stick around. My recommendation however: buy it in the sales, you'll probably be better off that way.(WARNING: long review ahead, proceed with caution)General thoughtsI've followed this game since it's early days on IndieDB, I've been looking forward to it's release on Steam. Now one small, quick (but important) note: the game description is too positive. ""Features the biggest, most detailed and alive open world city"". This is not true. Yes, it's a decently sized city, but nothing more. Let's compare the size of the map with the size of the map of GTA V. You know that airport at the bottom of LS? Yeah, it's about that big. It's a bit more spreaded, but surface-wise, about the size of the airport. Probably even smaller, since a big portion of the map is occupied by buildings and inaccessible parking lots. Yes, it has an Underground Tube station... Sort of... It's about 50-70 metres long, and you can't go on the traintracks or on the train. Yeah, kind of dissapointing. Furthermore, the cars differ in quality, some are plain old models that are, if I'm not mistaken. taken straight from UDK. Others seem like rather crappy, low-poly models that have a bunch of modelling and texture bugs. What about the livelyness of the city? Well, maybe as lively as a town full of zombies. There are about 5 models for pedestrians, all wearing meme-shirts. You can drive straight through them, no interaction at all. They don't fall over, jump out of the way, you can't even push them around. Then what about traffic? The traffic consists of a bunch of cars (with even lower resolution!) that seem to be on Scalextric tracks. You can push 'em around all you want, but the front wheels will always point to the direction they're going, That doesn't mean they're completely inanemate, you can cause massive pileups, send them flying and make them go all sixes and sevens.Now let's talk about gameplay, shall we?The handling, let's just get on with it straight away. Ehmm, boring and obvious is the only way I can describe it. It certainly doesn't have ground-breaking physics that would put  Raceroom Racing Experience  to shame. It's rather bland, unoriginal, almost as if the developer had just taken a default code for the driving physics. Which is probably what actually happened. Is that a particularly bad thing? No, most definitely not. As a manner of fact, I'd rather have someone just take a premade string of code, rather than creating their own code from scratch and messing up.RacesThis game comes with a few racemodes. Time-trial and checkpoint races. It's pretty straight forward, timetrial, you drive on your own, through one of the few courses. Finish before the timer runs out, you win. When the timer runs out and you haven't yet finished, you lose. Checkpoint races: you drive around a course with other opponents. Finish first and you'll win, and you know the rest.BugsThis game is riddled with bugs, so many in fact, it's somtimes a guilty pleasure to just play a game of 'How to break a game in as many ways as possible'. Just take this example: When you go over the bridge away from the city, you'll arrive at a teeny tiny, almost roundabout-sized island. in the middle: a bunch of rocks. Hit those rocks at high speeds, you'll jump, do massive flips with an incredible amount of air-time, and with a bit of luck, you might just land on the next bridge. It is however, way more likely you'll miss the bridge, and land in the water. Big problem? Not really. Underneath the surface of the water, or I could just say texture of a surface, there is a bonedry, hard floor. And now you can endlessly drive around in the water. But watch out, if you manage to find the edge of the map, you'll fall down into oblivion. And don't expect the reset-button to help there. When your car resets back onto the road you are closest to, the car will just freeze. You're able to bump into it with other cars, and it'll move, but you can't drive it. And once you're out of it, you can't get back in.Just a small example of a bug.Final verdict:Alright, that was a long, long review. Buy my final verdict is... 6/10.Surprised? I bet you are. This game is horribly made, I completely agree, but for the fun-factor, I'll give it a 9/10, probably. Yes, there are bugs, yes it's a short game, small map, done playing in probably two hours. But for me, it was a fun experience. It's still a fun game. But do beware: buy it when it's in the sales, when it costs next to nothing, because I sitll do not think it is worth that much money.And if you enjoy bug-hunting, this is fun as well.All jokes aside, buy it at your own risk, read the reviews, look at the trailers, maybe look up some gameplay footage on YouTube, whatever you do, take a deep thought. I had a lot of fun, but if you're after a serious racing game, look further. Raceroom Racing Experience  is a good place to start.			",30,13,14,0,5,1,1

												From the moment I launched this game and the Unreal Engine 3 User License Agreement popped up, I knew I was in for a magical ride. Things only got better from there!From the settings you get a choice of 16bit and 32bit colour, reminding me of the good ol' days. Also no audio settings.The motion blur, Kevin Mcloud music and unrelenting flickering transpot you into a world of recycled assets, handling like you're on an ice-skating rink and physics unrivalled in quality.The result? You're eyes bleed from some of the nighmarish NPC's (note the red-haired women in subway), the music is so loud you can't hear anything and you long for a brain aneurysm so it would end.Overall not the worst game I've played and for a single developer I applaud some of the effort that went in. However they clearly over reached here with their ambition.11/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At the time of this review, I am on the fence about ranking this positive or negative. I went with positive based on the low price of $2.99.The biggest problem isn't really with the game, but with the store pages. It contains some ""enhanced truths"" that I'd like to correct here.'massive environment'I'd say medium environment. There is a lot of variety to the city but it is, by no means, massive.'most advanced driving physics ever seen in an indie game'More arcade feeling than simulator. This is fine for me as I prefer arcade. But I've seen a few goofy things that isn't realistically possible.'unlock new vehicles as they progress'You don't get to pick what vehicle you drive in a race. Every stage in both race mode and time trials, your car is pre-selected. Every race you get assigned a different car. You can't modify the color or any parts for the car. Hardly what I would call ""Unlocking"".'players have the ability to choose one of the many tracks available'In both race mode and time trials, you cannot select a track. The track (like the cars mentioned above) are pre-determined.Those things said, the game is still an 'okay' racing game. If the developer had expanded on this a little more it would probably be a lot better. As it stands, it's a rather small racing game that will probably only keep you entertained for a few hours, at most. The cars are nice and in the free roam mode, you get to drive each one (but can't race them). The environment has a lot of things considering how small it is (beach, tunnel, narrow alley, bridge, small rural area). Overall it isn't a BAD game, it's just lacking in features.

												Bearing in mind the game is cheap to buy,i think it's not so bad.As of writing it's £1.25 ,so you can't expect the next NFS or something :)It just needs a bit more work to bring it up to an aceptable standard.It could do with a proper options menu ,ie: graphics and key-config.Graphics could be a whole lot better(but not so bad) as could the car physics and some collision  points.Usually if a game nails the gameplay then a lot of people will forgive the graphics.I'm pretty sure i played this via Desura a long time ago and was hoping the dev would have polished it a bit more before releasing on Steam.Maybe he will take on board some of the gripes and add some improvements.I still think you'll get a couple of hours of fun out of it as it is.You can compete with other cars or just drive around if you want.I'll give it a thumbs up for now and wait and see			",1789,728,51,210,200,20,238

Being Sick in Ocean CityI played this on a day off, when I felt kinda ill and feverish. This was the perfect opportunity for a trip to bright and bold Ocean City. Spent some time in free roaming mode and had a blast. Strange people and pale neon colours, bright skies and bizarre NPCs/citizens. The controls were fine for controlling my car and character, I didn't  really pursue any ""proper"" races. I just wanted to look at everything, every shopwindow, because it all seemed handcrafted.But. It was over all too quickly. A bridge under construction stopped me unexpectedly. The supposedly huge game world simply ended.I want more. More people that gesticulate wildly or stare at things. My trip was a fun nightmare, as if the Killer7 on-rails train had jumped out the tracks.  Apparently, a lot of people hate these NPCs. I don't care. I want to live in Ocean City.

												I had some fun with it I mean walking out and discovering the city was somehow entertaining during a few minuts and discovering all the glitches was also fun but...This game is not good enouh to ask 3 dollars I mean it is sure not alot of money but it is just so baaad...The textures of the main cars are ok but all the rest just looks awfull...The racing mode is nearly useless and time trial is really really useless...The music is really cool tho...I think the devs tried at least and the game is just cute you know with all thoose bugs and amateur thingys.I wouldn't recommend it, really if you want a good racing game keep your hands off this.

												Okay, so this isn't a GREAT game, but it's not completely horrible either.  I wouldn't recommend it for anyone that calls themselves a gamer, but I'd recommend it for kids.  I have 2 seven year olds that would probably LOVE playing this game.  It's simple, non-violent, and easy.  A great intro game for kids to open-world driving games.  Also, a nice little collection of royalty-free music.  I'm recommending this game just because I think some of the previous reviewers are a little to harsh on this little game.  For the price it's fine.			",179,33,8,10,27,1,9

												Poor game and horribly made, even for an indie game, it could of been better! Could barely run this game. No graphic tuning feature to allow me to adjust the settings if I could. A shame because the city isn't so badly decorated but it feel very narrow. So narrow that it doesn't feel like a city. I'm not sure why I'm treated with a exotic vehicle from the start. It feels like a bribe to get me to play the game. On-foot free roaming is in first person view while the default view for vehicles are in third person view. Some vehicles are drivable and some vehicles are for decoration.  I don't really understand why. Lacks client polish as the game still sports the UDK icon on the app window.			",129,18,5,6,23,0,13

												This game is pretty cool.The free roam mode is nice and it's fun to try tricks in between the two bridges. There are a couple of things this game can have improved though. A bigger map would always be appreciated. A online multiplayer would also be appreciated. The shadow line things that go horizontally across the screen are alittle anoying at first. The engine noises are pretty bad.Overall, I think this game is a cool game that nice to play around with for a while, which is what I think this game was made for.			",46,2,0,1,1,0,1

												Well, I can respect the person or people who made this game, and I can see where they are coming from. I understand the urge to slack when it comes to detail and player UI. But somethings are unexcusible. Pros: Good car modelsSome Locations are done with a proper amount of detailGraphics are not half badGood Driving Mechanic (for messing around in free roam)Cons:Some textures are just photoshoped pictures that look like they were taken with a 5 dollar camera, Some textures break licencing agreements, (mainly car brands that were not blurred out enough) (also I don't know if it does break licence, I just know that cheaper games make spinoffs of real items made by brands so they don't get a Copyright infringement notice) Non-Drivable cars have as many polys as Mario did in Super Mario 64Some areas have invisible walls that shouldn't be blocked off are, and areas that should be blocked off aren'tSome models are broken and seem like they are stock with the engine, (Mostly the hummers, with the spare tire sitting on the front grill, blocking half the windshield.CONCLUSION: I can't judge this game too hardly, I got it for 74 cents and I don't know if I'd pay $3 for this, (but thats the same for most games)So this game scores a Solid 6.9/10  ",189,25,3,7,21,1,5

												If your looking for an indepth AAA OpenWorld Racing game this is not for you. I bought this game expecting a game that sucks so much you can laugh at it. However I was plesently suprised by the game. There are three modes racing, time trial and free roam. I actually haven't tried any modes other than the free roam however the free roam is suprisingly good.This game is defenitely deserving of your money as it gives a lot of fun for like 3 bucks.

												First off, do I recommend this game? It's hard to say. I want to give the game a good review for the effort put in, so this is the best I can do.I'll try to keep the review as quick and concise as possible, so read on :)While the game has a good concept, the actual result needs some work. I like how it is open world, and it has what I wish a lot of open world car games would include - a first person mode, where you can walk around, explore, and hop into other cars you see. I know GTA allows you to do this, but I don't like the extreme violence in that series, and therefore don't play em. Physics wise, the cars behave fine at low speeds but once they are moving, I feel that they are not loose enough on the rear wheels, and thus feel a bit weird (i.e, they don't slide out at the back if cornering hard).The game uses the Unreal engine, so the graphical effects are quite nice. However, the quality of the car modles, and overall world detail could use some work. I understand that only a few people made the game, so it's not always possible to go into heavy detail like AAA games have, but still, they could have delayed its release and worked on the models a bit more.I noticed some graphical shadow bugs when running fullscreen - not sure what was causing that. My computer definitely isn't underpowered, so it's most likely some bug. Content-wise, what you get is appropriate for the price (I think there are around 10 cars). For the most part, I noticed a dfferent suspension setup values for each car. For example, the Camaro looks and feels different to the Mini.The world, in my opinion, needs some more stuff to do though. After half an hour of driving, I found myself wanting to either challenge someone or upgrade my car. I know there is a race mode, but in any game, I much rather race real people than AI. All up, I appreciate the work put into the game, but I honestly have to say that I won't play the game much, because there is nothing to bring me back to it later - which, in my case, is multiplayer. It doesn't matter what game I'm playing - if it's single player (especially in the racing genre), sooner or later I'm going to get bored of it. Good example: the very first GRID game in Codemaster's series had multiplayer support pulled - and I haven't played that game in a good 5 (or how many years since the servers were shut down, I can't remember) years since driving against AI is so... boring.Final Conclusion:If you have a few bucks to spend, and some time to kill, then maybe you will like it. Like they say, it's the price of a cup of coffee (although I never drink the stuff :P). If you're looking for a multiplayer game with a huge world, high quality models, and lots of content, then no. As a side note, young kids will probably enjoy the violence-free open world and ability to walk to and drive different cars.The game certainly needs more work to be a polished and fun experience.

												First of all - this is small indie game, what was made by a few people, so don't need expect high quality product with VR support, Direct X 12 and etc. Second - I can't say that OCEAN CITY RACING is bad, its just not so good enouth, as for me. I liked in game good car models, shadows, sky, the change of night and day and the price (its $2.99 here, but I recommend to take it on sale or from bundle). Things, what I don't like: no support my resolution (currently using 1366x768 monitor) and no option to turn off blur effect (really do not like this in any games). Its up to you - buy OCEAN CITY RACING or not.			",3916,1515,161,434,572,52,618

The map is very small and there's not really anything to see, many of the cars are undriveable scenery meshes, and the pedestrians will just walk through you with no collision at all. I tried crossing the bridge but there was a big ""not constructed yet"" sign at the end and I fell in the ocean.

												This game is easily one of the best values in a racing game. For only $3, you can enjoy this awesome open-world city. The free mode is reminiscent of GTA but without the violence. On top of the free mode, OCR offers a pretty realistic race mode. The graphics aren't so great, but the huge open world makes it well worth it. Try this game, and you won't regret it!

												Alright,  so after playing this game for about an hour I have managed to pretty much unlock the full potential of the game, therefore enough to write a review. This game has hilarious physics with the quirky arcadey feel element which is already an awesome combination, and it has has pretty decent graphics. This game has alot of easter eggs for you to find to keep you playing. This is obviously not like GTA 6 style its a small project game. I say for a small project game it is pretty awesome. The cons would be, after you complete the game it will get repetitive really easily, but it will manage to keep you entertained for quite a bit. (this isnt a con but whatever) This game also runs on Unreal engine 3 which is pretty advanced for a game like this.In conclusion, i would recommend you buy this game and try it out if you are into any of the things listed above.

												I personally was entrauled by the confusing level of confusion when I had control of these vehicles. The car's handled like a dream, and by that I was laughing and almost wetting the bed when I discovered the lack of brakes down hill at over 700 miles per hour. Slamming into the slightest curb I found myself outside of the map and on my roof, the most horrifying thing of this happening of course being the fact the car was completely okay! The driver, I can say, WAS not the same condition! I sat there in utter confusion with a fit of giggles strangling and suffocating in my laughter! Then I spent at least 45 minutes per race watching the A.I drivers endlessly drive into the wall to which I had located them too. This is why you use reverse, ladies and gentlemen.

												I enjoyed this game, don't get me wrong. But sadly it just isn't good enough to get a recommendation let alone a positive review from me. Let's start with the good side - it uses the Unreal Engine, so graphics are nice and up-to-date. It has really good functionality and also has incredible potential. With a little more time put into it, I'm sure it could have made the new Midtown Madness. Back in those days everyone wanted the ability to get out of the car and walk around, without having features of GTA where you'd beat up people and junk. Just a shame this was released before it was properly completed.			",2587,1027,102,247,386,37,416

												GREAT GAME !Yes if you love racing games - you will find this very fun,but if you just enjoy wandering through the town and surrounding area - you will LOVE this game !Enjoy listening to tunes as you can get out and walk, or  ride around on a quad - great way to enjoy the city.And so much good music!   I love the music!  I can just start up the game and let the music play while doing other things on my PC.  Rock music / beach music - kinda like Miami Vice meets baywatch.Fun Graphics and  whimsical, a bit like goat simulator.Not as many random things as goat simulator,but if you like just wandering and exploring - this is a good game for you.  Well worth a few bucks.Thank you STEAM! A virtual  summer time vacation good for cold winter months.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not sure if I would recommend this title or not. It has it's issues for sure with the flashing/buffering of textures on the builds,cars and npc's. and the npc's walking around with rubber arms, even the dog passing by me walked funny. This game was included in a bundle along with games my wife would play and I decided to try this. I know its probably still being worked on and in development. What would do the game better is some more buildings with a interior instead of the textured box buildings, so 80's A workshop or editor would be good as well to add customizing and or adding of new buildings, cars etc. I have seen worse and i have seen better. Worth 2.99? eh. yeah for a laugh or something to play for a little bit to have something quick to play			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is actually fun. Try the racing mode. Once you get the hang of it it's very enjoyable to the extent of being therapeutical. The physics adds a lot to the enjoyment. It's so easy to spin the AI cars around by ramming into them, and they ram into you as well. It is actually quite funny.That being said, it's a casual racer with pretty graphics by the Unreal Engine 3. Getting first place shouldn't be too difficult if you actually try to win.The free roam mode adds some quality mindless exploration. Some other reviews say this game is great for kids, and I agree. But that doesn't mean it's meant only for them.People tend to expect too much from games it seems.Unique physics, unreal graphics and good opponent AI, what more could you ask for?The soundtrack is actually quite relaxing, and a change from the usual stuff I listen to.Overall this game is a good escape. Something we could all use every now and then. ",149,16,7,4,7,0,16

												Ok so this game isn't bad, but its not particularly good either.Firstly, the game looks superb. the models are pretty, the map looks good and the lighting is nice.The free roam option in this is fun, it makes the game basically a new version of midtown madness! It would be great if the racing option was fused with the freeroam, this would make the game a bit more fun.The cars handle great, that is untill you crash.However, I feel the game isn't complete. There simply isn't enough to do on the map, and it doesn't feel big enough.The braking feels almost like it doesnt work properally and the replay function is incredibly buggy in the racing section - at times it placed be somewhere completely random, making me lose.If this was to be fixed, and well... finished it could be good, this has the potential to be a great game!I can't really complain too much for how much it is worth, it can be fun if you have nothing better to do. I bought this in a 50c bundle with lots of other games so I guess I got my moneys worth. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But by my playtime it was boring and repetive so badly I would immediatly play something like the crew or need for speed. In the end if you have 3 dollars to waste dont do it here.

OVERVIEWThis game is supposed to be all about driving every car you see, but most cars are just there for show, and the worst part is the show is awful. You know from the distance which cars you can drive and the ones you can't, because the ones you can't, look like ♥♥♥♥. Literally, they look awful, from the low poly model too the awful textures on it.Game options in indie games tend to be low, but this is a new low. But let's break it down, you can change the resolution based on very few presets, you can choose if you want the game to run on a window or fullscreen, you can choose the color depth between 16 bits and 32 bits, and that's it. WHAT?! WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥!!! Where are the rest of the options? Where the ♥♥♥♥ is the Turn off the motion sickness caused by the extreme motion blur button? Where are the sound options? WHY CAN'T I TURN OFF THE AWFUL DISCO MUSIC PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND?By the way, the resolutions you can choose from:800x6001024x7681280x7201280x10241440x9001920x10801920x1200The walking FOV is extremely low, but since you won't be playing this game for more than 2 minutes, it should be ok.I can't comment about the race mode and the trial mode, because I didn't wanna try it cause it's probably ♥♥♥♥ like the rest of the game.PROSNitrous is fun to use cause it makes the car freak outBus stop ads and car sign ads are pretty funny (ripping off real brands and making fun of them)Cars appear to be a mix of real world cars, kinda like how GTA does it, and they look greatDrivable go-kartDay-night cycleNEUTRALCars have no visual damageCant run over people (THEY'RE GHOSTS, RUUUUN!)Overused memes and grafittisPlayable character is always male (Not that it matters, but oh well)Only one car camera (wish it had more views)No way to look back (wish it had a look back button, or some type of rearview mirror)No minimap (would be cool for races)Cars control alright, until you turn too fast and they start flying all over the placeMight be me, but the bridges between islands are really low and it looks unnaturalCONSGame options are a ♥♥♥♥ing JOKE.Awful optimizationExcessive motion blur, bloom, DOF, THAT CANNOT BE TURNED OFF!Physics are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful (cars bounce back after hitting something, braking feels like you are driving on ice)Can't run over benches, small trees, bushes, flimsy fences or anything in general, and you will get stuck on EVERYTHINGThe render/draw distance seems pretty badLow FOVMusic is REALLY ♥♥♥♥ing annoying, and obviously there is absolutely no way to turn it offRestart button doesn't workYou can get stuck outside the playable areaCar engine sounds appear to be all based around the same sound, but with different pitchThe world looks big, but in reality, when you start driving around you'll realize that it's NOTFor some reason the devs thought it would be cool to lock out most areas and then allow you to jump into pools. WHY? The water looks ♥♥♥♥ and the player doesn't even swim, he just walks like there was no water and it just looks dumbCONCLUSIONAwful optimization. Small amount of options. Low amount of content in the game. Driving physics are bad. Small world. SPOILER CONCLUSIONIt's ♥♥♥♥. Don't buy it. ",320,93,26,29,13,5,19

Also the map is small and the game tryed to redeem itself when they added that you can ride a bear anbd stuff but it just made the game even laggyer (sorry if this isnt a word).

												I bought this game and i must admit Freemode on this game is absolutly fun i do enjoy it Why isnt Ocean City A gmod map it would be good to be a  GMOD map as well i would certainly put it on my server Pros:- good Visuals :-Good freeroam:- Good Models of player vehicles (Could be a fairly popular pack if you uploaded these vehicles fully working to gmod):-Ghost people  At least they wont get in the way :- Arcade RacingCons:- Clunky Controls:- only has KMH as  a unit of measurement Why not have an option for mph:- Brakes on cars not very effective:- Limited amount of vehicles for the player to useCons:- unfinished mappingSuggestions:- Use some of the traffic cars in game to be allowed for use  to players just smoothen them a bit because i really wanted to drive the hummer Hx  which is one of the traffic cars  which are undrivable and a few other decent cars that are only traffic cars? i love volvo cars couldnt they be used by player (traffic only) , Crown Victorias (traffic only) as well.I just wish all cars where playable ingame they just need some smoothing and a uv map and a small amount of fixing:- Customization you need to be able to customize you cars basically.Overall :- Good gameplay in freeroam good for a bit of fun and for £1,45 its not bad at all really good could be worth more to be honest if you added a few of my suggestionsIt has alot of potential This game, a bit backdated though reminds me of the old Rage Rally Game and GmodI do recommend this if you wallet isnt big enough for a ""well known game""Please make all of these cars and this map Gmod Workshop addons all fully working i would love to have that in my workshop files for my server Advanced Racing Sandbox			",162,4,25,8,14,0,16

												I bought this game for only 59 cents on sale, and upon starting the game, I had one race, then it crashed while loading the next.So I restarted the game, had another race, and crashed again loading the next race.If I exit to the main menu and then go back into race mode between races though, it doesn't crash.As for the rest of the game:The graphics are pretty basic, even for a 2012 game (not necessarily a bad thing)The car hanadling is atrocious, I was using the handbrake to make corner on EVERY turn rather than normal brake.The Nitro seems not to help at all.The AI is really bad, making it far too easy to win races.The Open World is very small and incomplete, meaning that you you pretty much see all of it after only just over 5 minutes of driving around, and there are hundreds of parked cars that you can not use at all. I found only about half a dozen cars that I could actually enter and drive while driving around.The music is pretty good though.I wouldn't recommend this game even all the normal price of $2.99, but for 59 cents in the sale, I am not going to worry about getting my money back. Maybe I'll play a race once in a while, but the game is very small and races easy to beat.			",5,0,2,0,0,1,0

												Looking at the Steam Reviews i don't know what happened to this game, maybe they changed something else when they added ""Redux"" to the game title? I remember playing ""Ocean City Racing"" without the Redux thingy.It has some regular graphics, car models are no-named but looking fair enough, they are parked all over the city.Game physics... Well, to be honest it's not the best one and it's pretty bugged. This game is a little good game for max an hour of playing. When you discover all the cars there is basically nothing to do.It might be good for your kid, he might actually enjoy it and you can take a break from the parenting thingy.			",43,3,8,0,4,0,0

I think this is a fun little game to use up a bit of your spare time and I wish I had the skills to make a game as good as this. ADVICE: Maybe add a police mode or steamworkshop so people can freely mod the game and make it even better, and hey, theres los of game which have become AMAZING and popular games just because it was modded.

												I would put a neutral rating considering it's a small project made for an academic thesis, but as it's not possible the game gets a negative rating. It's just too rough to be recommendable. With a bit more work the game could be better but at least it's dirt cheap.Graphics are not too bad, even though quite disappointing for an Unreal Engine 3 game. The models are very low quality, texture work is from the 90s, shaders are very simple and there are many, many bugs (such as the shadows being projected ""upwards"" on some locations). But some areas are not too bad looking and the lightning can look really good (notably at night).Sounds are pretty bad. The engine sound curve seems tied to the speed of the car, which causes sound glitches when cornering: the engine alternates between two ""gears"" and sounds really bad.Complete lack of actual video settings, and absolutely no audio settings.Race mode and Time trial mode can be done in a couple of hours, if you manage to never miss checkpoints. As the game doesn't show you anything to tell you the checkpoint is validated, you may end up losing 10 minutes of racing because a checkpoint wasn't validated. It's a bit frustrating but something that, I reckon, could be fixed in minutes if the developer decided to go a bit further with the game. The AI is incredibly basic and slow and won't hesitate to run into you or another opponent. It's not uncommon to lap one or more AI cars on some of the longer races. Free roaming is empty and a bit boring (also, 60 FOV is quite tight). Not a very challenging game.Driving physics are acceptable for an arcade game, though a bit understeery, but the gameplay is let down by the way the collisions are handled. Overall quite pleasant as long as you keep away from touching anything.Needs more work to be good.			",525,87,88,37,90,5,73

												I knew that reviews were bad, but game was at low price, so I wanted to try it.This one of the worst racing game I played since 15 years ... The map is tiny, all cars are handling similar (and it's very bad), textures are bad, modeling of the car is not very good, physics engine is laughable, the colors choices are making my eyes burning and you can't customize controls ...I think I prefer to play Aquatic Baseball Mutant Poney Simulator 2006 : Dualshock Edition for the rest of my life, rather than play Ocean City Racing again for 5 minutes and feel dirty inside my body.

												This Game has so much potential if it had a better interface..... The free roam function has almost no real play ability, you just walk around and take cars, there are no races, trials, or anything of that nature......

												I noticed this game in my backlog and figured I'd give it a go. I love driving aimlessly in an open world! So I start it up and it sorta chugs through the loading screen, on this rather powerful gaming PC. So I check the graphics options and... there's really just resolution. Now, I've used the Unreal Engine before, there are PLENTY of options built in that could be easily listed there, but okay, I turn down the resolution and try the free roaming.I start on-foot, walking to the nearest car. Quite slowly, but a neat touch, at least, and I can jump slightly. Get in, start driving around. Hit a pedestrian, and... they stand stock-still while my car thuds to a stop like it hit a brick wall. Okay, then. Drive away, go to head to the bridge in the distance. Try to drift, brakes make steering no longer a thing. Okay, then. Try to drift with the e-brake, practically instant stop. Okay, then. Bump into the car in front of me and it cartoonishly soars over my hood. That's pretty neat, actually! Probably not right, but very entertaining. Hit the next car, thud to a stop. Bump into a guard rail, thud to a stop. Hit some chairs, they go flying, hit the table the chairs were at, thud to a stop. So that's weirdly inconsistent, but okay, don't hit things. Got a bit lost trying to get up to the bridge, finally find a looping ramp up to it, get on, drive over and head to a small island. I can see another city in the distance... but driving to there magically pops in construction barriers. Oh, okay, I guess this game is in Early Access and they're still making the map! That explains a lot of the rough edges, that's fine.I go back and drive around a bit, this time on an ATV, and awkwardly teeter around on it, my driver bizarrely superglued to the handlebars. Still neat to be able to drive around the smaller alleyways and such. I get off of it and walk into a subway station, fully modeled with a rather plainly textured train going by and posters of odd, stretched resolutions. Eh, that's all fine for Early Access, they'll fix it.And then came the real bad part. It's NOT in Early Access. It's ""done"", a ""complete"" product. It needs a TON of work to be anywhere beyond just ""tolerable"", and if that work isn't being put in... I really can't recommend you play this, let alone pay three bucks for it. Could get a big thing of soda and a Hot Wheels car for less than that price and have more fun.			",202,57,48,14,17,5,10

												I find it hard to recommend this game at this point. I got a ""YOU WON"" for ending in third place, eerily reminding me of the ""You're Winner"" from Big Rigs over the road racing. NPCs are made out of extremely impact resistant materials. They stop your car dead in its tracks without any damage to the car or them. Car handling feel unfinnished and they dont look as smooth as in the screenshots with no real graphic options other than resolution settings and colour depth. Music sounds good and the car models have appeal. By todays standards, sorry it doesnt cut it. Eg. Assetto Corsa			",321,115,34,44,47,1,75

												I played the first two races. Honestly it was pretty simple to get 1st place in them, the music was good, and I did have fun. That being said, the controls are absolutely horrible. I feel like there is some potential, because a simple racing game is always fun to play with friends, but this does have a very unfinished feeling. I wouldn't suggest you spend your money on it, fortunately I got this in a cheap bundle. I might actually play it some more.			",355,225,5,50,23,3,34
