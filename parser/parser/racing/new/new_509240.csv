												Cheap PS2 era graphics and complete lack of physics totally ruins this game. You may complete a few races, but you'll find out pretty fast that there's nothing new there. Even levels just repeat themselves. It really bugs me that this got 85% positive and Glacier 3 got only 20%. Both of them shoud have ~40-50%.			",604,148,26,66,36,11,80

												Today I had an idea to download and tryout Flatout 3... but it was well... unbearable, considering how Flatout 2 is great game. And then I played this...Good sides:+ could be obtained for free (card profitz)+ musical tracks by Kevin MacLeod (he's musical genius, making music for hundreds of indie games)Neutral:~ can be beaten in about 1,5 hours, which is less than card drops require~ at least made effort to try make plot/storyline hereBad sides:- poor physics- poor graphics (no graphic options)- only 2 musical tracks?- no controller support (not even re-binding options... my fingers hurts from driving on arrows)- saying ""Little racing indie project."" and demanding 6 euro as full price... really?!- only 5 or 6 racing tracks in game- feels like mobile port... (lacks of basic things, like accepting purchase of upgrade with enter... everything done with mouse... if you press ESC, you can't continue game by pressing ESC again... click ""Continue"" on screen with mouse)PS: I'm top player in this game, according to leaderboards:http://steamcommunity.com//stats/509240/leaderboards/1395542 ",445,150,17,46,41,7,47

 How do I describe this game? a little entertainment. nothing more, nothing less.If you can pass the 10-20 minutes of painful races to get a better car and upgrade said car so it can actually drive, then it can be kind of enternaining, enough to get all the cromos at the very least.If you are looking for a racing game, this is definetly not for you.

												Well this game.. when i played it i expected something worse.. but it was actually pretty fun! The vehicles have different weapons and you can upgrade them to make them stronger, to go faster, etc. Is pretty simple yet good fun for a cheap price. My problem is with the nitro tho, it works.. pretty weird.. other than that, the game is quite fun. Oh, and it has trading cards too.8/10			",59,15,0,5,2,0,8

												How this garbageware made with Unity personal edition keeps getting on Steam is baffleing to me. What you have here is a game that is trying to be Gas Guzzlers Extreme, but it isn't. It's an unfinished mess, no controller support, options menu limited to resolution and volume, no instruction or explanation of what keys do what (how do I use nitro?), no ability to turn the car more than 10 degrees left or right. This is a highschool project gone wrong. Anyone who gave this game a positive review is either paid to do so, obsessed with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cards or delusional. Do not waste your money on this pile of turds, get Gas Guzzlers Extreme instead.			",706,202,48,120,94,13,117

												It is an alright game. Remember folks this was made by the Unity engine, so it isn't going to be perfect. Do i think its worth the $6? With some improvements made to the core gameplay perhaps. I was hooked on it for quite a while, and it reminds me of classic beat em up racers of the PS1 days. I love games that bring back that whole Nostalgic feeling, and this is very good at doing that. It is a keyboard only game currently, if that doesn't bother you and you have some time to kill I'd say go for it. I am used to playing racers like this on keyboard. Pros: Fun to mess around withDecent line up of events including boss races.OST is fitting, kind of like Test Drive Offroad. Small file sizeDoesn't require the latest computer specs to run.Cons:Currently it is loaded with bugs, crashed when i tried to exit the first time. Some tracks can feel pretty repetative and the payout for races isn't a lot. Bosses are a bit overpowered, and often require a near fully upgraded vehicle to beat. Which means re-doing events to earn money. Translation needs improvement.My feelings are fairly mixed on this game, i like it for what it is. If you are looking for a time waster and like classic games, this may be for you. I knew what i was getting when i bought it, and i have played different Unity games in the past. I hope that the dev for this works on improving the game and perhaps adding in new content. The potential is there, but i also feel like this may have been a rushed project. if anyone has some questions i can try to give you a better run down.			",101,87,17,28,3,0,6

												Hell of a race! No compromice racing game – you just cannot take part in next race until you win, yes, until you are Number One  in a current race! However, this was really easy. At least in first five races. So easy, I just could not stop playing for these whole 30 minutes! However, game's becoming more difficult from race to race, and, despite the graphics looks the way ""welcome back to early 90s"" you drive differently on a road and on a beach sand and you feel your car is behaving differently. Ah, yes, you have nitro and weapons - or maybe there is any other racing game without it? Garage? Shop? Couple of words of game's ""story""? On one hand it has every typical thing a racing game should have; on other - maybe we could have couple more environments? Random powerups on a track? You can turn it on, play for couple of minutes without any interference with what you've been doing - just in a situation people usually play spider or mines - you can be playing it even while talking over phone!
