												The controls are pretty damned terrible, especially for controllers. The graphics gave me a headache, due to the game trying to emulate a classic CRT TV, which I personally think is a pretty terrible idea.All in all, I couldn't find this game too enjoyable. It could be good, but it will need a hell of a lot of polishing, and some rethought controls.Also, pressing pause on a controller completely closes the game, which is a REALLY STUPID IDEA.

												The game might have been good eventually but the strongest mechanic that brings it down is when you die, you start on the side of the screen. Not a big problem until you realize that enemies can also drive on that side. So everytime you start to move an enemy will crash into you and the inevitable cycle of starting and stopping repeats itself. This could easily be fixed by letting you have invisibility frames after you start moving instead of keeping you in one place for a second and a half. The other problem is the motorcycle moves way too slow. For a ""precision"" game, you move a snails pace across the screen. Meanwhile the other cars blaze on by. Might not be a problem but i have had a whole lot of  random factor of 3 trucks catacorned with each other going full speed and you cant dodge that.			",296,69,8,45,19,3,35

												Really a terrible ""game"".I grew up in the time when games were like that. But times change, and so should games. Only very few people today still carry ""ghetto blasters"" with them, or use a ""walk man"".This game would fit in that time. At least in some way.I bought it in a bundle, so no money wasted, but hope to prevent anybody to waste money on it.Why I ""played"" it so many hours if it is trash? Because of steam trading cards! First 8 hours nothing unlocked, so I let it run again in the background. And even the cards are ugly...""Sorry"" to all the people that I made angry with my ""dislike"" for this game... Get over it. I will never like it, or change my review. I did delete now the nonsense comments.Just makes me even more say ""DO NOT BUY""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It sort of reminds me of the old NES game Zippy Race.  Pretty straight-forward where you try to get to finish line while dodging obstacles before your ""hope"" (fuel) runs out, so you need to determine to either drive slower so you can dodge easier, or put the pedal to the metal and dodge like crazy to hit the finish line faster.  Later levels essentially turn into one big Bullet Hell dodge-fest where you need to strategically plan to use your special attacks to wipe out the enemies on the screen.  The price point is on the mark, it's nothing above and beyond an NES game of this nature, or a really oldschool 80's arcade would offer, and not something I'd expect people to invest much time into, more of a ""pick up and play to waste 10 minutes here and there"" sort of game.

												Old-school NES-style game where you dodge obstacles (cars, jets, bullets, bees, bears, etc.) while trying to make it to the finish line. The game has cut-scenes and a story about deliverying organs to hospitals with loads of nostalgia tossed in for good measure. Music and visuals are good. It has a pseudo-CRT effect with scanlines and even a moire effect. The gameplay is pretty basic but it is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. Even the first level is quite hard to get past. It respawns you in the busiest lane of traffic and you just get pummeled by a non-stop flow of speeding cars. There is a period of invincibility for a few seconds after respawn but it doesn't always work, sometimes you just die instantly even though your guy is blinking.On the Xbox 360 controller, the d-pad is used to steer (left/right) and control speed (up/down). Given the famously poor d-pad of the Xbox 360 controller, I often find myself accidentally speeding up or down when trying to steer. That's not the game's fault and in my case, with no other controller options, I think it's actually easier to play this game with a keyboard.Overall it is simple but frustratingly fun. The furthest I've made it is level 3.			",2687,1026,92,232,346,29,379

												Well this is an example of everything that's wrong with the indy games market.This is a low effort retro arcade game wannabe.  It's very poor to play - actual arcade games that it apes are better, so you can just install an emulator if you want a genuine retro experience.Terrible graphics (in before ""it's retro so we didn't need to do any actual artwork"").No video options (actually locks you into a crappy 3:4 portrait screen and makes the graphics look warped to try be a TV... we already know they've made no effort with graphics, no need to hammer in the point guys).

you play 3 levels + take down a boss as a organ delivery biker with a death wish who likes to drive the wrong way on roads, travel through military zones, bee nests, and water towers. you have 3 bars to keep track of, mojo (speed), hope (hp/special), & go/end (progress bar). Game play is driving down the road dodging obstacles, collecting hearts/points, & throwing hearts to medivacts until you get the progress bar to the end part. your bike has 7 speeds that will deplete your hope bar slowly or faster if you're not on the road but collecting hearts will give you more ""hope"". if you get close to the side of a vehicle a + will pop up and if you hit it or other object you'll lose ""hope"", be set to the right side of the road, & your speed will be dropped to 0. you also lose ""hope"" if anything hits you. every so often a medivact will show up and a square will be highlighted on the road, and you can throw hearts at it if your in the square but you'll lose some ""hope"" though if you give it 4-5 it will refill about half your bar when it leaves. you do get1 attack if you collect 4 hearts the word hope will flicker and you can clear the screen of most enemies. everything comes at you at random so you never really know whats going to happen.

												Note: I only played Arcade mode, but no story could save this game from it's unintuitive gameplay and weird design quirks.Organ Biker is horrible at communicating with the player. It first launches as a teeny tiny 256x240 window, which is the only place where the game outlines the controls, which make no sense to you if you've never played the game.Once in the game, what you do is dodge cars (and later missiles from stealth bombers), collect pick-ups and when an ""ambulance plane"" comes on screen, you enter the green ""launch zone"" and shoot hearts at it for points. If you crash, your bike respawns on the right side of the road, and you're invincible for a while.To move left or right, you need to have speed, or ""MOJO"" as the game intuitively calls it. Logically you lose your mojo when you crash, but your input is disabled for a while after you crash, leaving you watching a flickering stationary bike for a while.The game doesn't in any way indicate the input is disabled, so the first time you'll likely not understand what's going on, and crash again, because, natureally, the cars *CAN* drive in the part of the road where you respawn. The next time  you'll be manically hammering UP to get your ""mojo"" on and be able to get out of the way of danger. Why this happens, I have no idea. It definitely doesn't add anything to the game. According to a recent developer announcement, there should be a six seconds invincibility period, but in effect this is usually wasted on waiting for input to become active again.Your HP is called HOPE, which you refill by picking up heart pick-ups. You lose HOPE over time, whenever you crash and if you get hit by the stealth bombers missiles.Picking up four heart pick-ups grants you one use of a screen clearing bomb that, unfortunately works on a delay, so more than once, not wanting to waste it, I tried using it at the last second, but because the actual clearing of the screen happens after the heart animation has played, I still crashed. Trying go gauge the right time to use the bomb is pretty difficult, and later in the game it's almost useless anyway, because of the time it takes to collect four hearts is very long in relation to the amount of hazards you face.Organ Biker doesn't have any animations at all just static sprites (well, the bike sprite gets flipped when you ""turn"", but even then the sprite is almost symmetrical). Some of the ""old school"" effects just look weird (especially the moiré-effect looks like it's just a static texture). The music is very hit and miss, luckily you can choose it manually so you can just opt to never to listen to the worse tracks.Unless you disable the arcade-effects, some of the text is pretty hard to read, because your combo and score are not displayed in the same pixel font as the rest of the UI, but instead in a standard serif font, that the arcade effect makes pretty unreadable.The game doesn't have a pause function, and no apparent way to quit mid game, appart from just closing the program with Alt+F4.Bottom line is Organ Biker just isn't fun, the controls are iffy and some of the design choices are just arbitary and weird. Apparently the game is still beign worked on, which gives hope, but at this point, I definitely do not recommend buying it. If there are any updates to the game, I'll make sure to update my review.

Organ Biker is a very hard game. After an hour of playing I only made it just over halfway through the first level. The tutorial is very vague and mostly leaves it up to the player to discover the mechanics. I loved the old-school graphics and soundtrack. The bits of story I did see were very stylish and fun. The controls were mostly solid, my only frustration coming from the second or two you're forced to wait every time you hit another vehicle. I think if this game had a slightly easier difficulty curve I may have been able to recommend it. It's a shame I wasn't able to see more of this game. PROS-cool art and style-tight soundtrack-cute storyCONS-way too difficult-waiting after you hit another vehicleDISCLAIMER: Review is based upon approx 1 hour of gameplay.			",472,257,6,27,48,1,34

												Beat this game in 12 minutes with no concrete understanding of how it's supposed to be played. I still can't figure out what's going on most of the time. Playing this game well seems to depend upon a combination of moving left and right and accelerating and decelerating at the right times in order to manuever around the various hazards. But Organ Biker is designed so sloppily, is so glitchy, and there's such an absurd amount of obstacles to dodge that I actually don't think it's possible to play it well. Instead, I think the developer just understood that what they were asking the player to suffer through was impossible, so they just made the entire thing really forgiving. This retro-inspired overlay isn't doing the game any favors either, make that ♥♥♥♥ optional. Not everyone is a 20-something hipster that wanks to scanlines and CRTs and overpays for physical copies of games they've never played but still fondly reminisce over.			",1354,349,42,84,95,8,80

												Really bad game, just really bad.It tries to be like the old nes/atari games but the gameplay is horible. Even if you go past the fake crt screen look that hurts the eyes and the generic 8-bit music, the gameplay is a mess.You ride a bike, you change speed like in the classic outrun game (you have 3 tiers of speed here) and you try to avoid cars and helicopters and collect points and hearts by going left and right. You also have an attack. The cars are all over the place and some helicopters are shooting projectiles at you and the screen is just a big cluster♥♥♥♥. You just have to avoid as many cars as possible while you try to collect the hearts. there are only 4 super sort stages, a horible boss fight and some childish ""funny"" story.This is one of these games you would expect to find free from someone that made it from fun in his free time. Sure the price is very low but even if this was free it would still be bad.			",546,205,23,83,35,4,70
