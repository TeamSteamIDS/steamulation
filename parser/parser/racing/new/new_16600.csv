The mechanics of the bike and the physics-based rider makes the game have a funny side as well.I give this a 8.5/10 for being a great pickup and play game.			",283,48,9,32,29,1,26

												Trials 2 is a great game, i had great times playing it.  Controls are very simple, just throttle, break, tilt back and forward, but the game becomes very technical as you pass the levels and every little movement will count on your performance. It´s not like all those tilt games out there, this has really nice physics and gameplay, and a lot of havoc!Also is a great game to play when you only have 5 or 10 minutes available. You can race with ghosts or watch replays from others players, and when you see the best players runs you cannot believe how good you can get to be.  It´s a very fun game with a lot of crazy stunts, i recommend it to any person.			",179,50,9,15,18,2,12

												For a $2.49 purchase price it wasn't too bad. After clearing the stages I didn't have any desire to go back and replay, perhaps if I had the option of running vs AI bikes or online people at the same time (onscreen) it'd have been a different scenario but as it stands, it was a purchase I could have gone without.The gameplay is tight but there are moments of ""UGH I WILL DESTROY YOU."" There are some physics exaggeration but that is to be expected for a title like this to work and be successful. While they are exaggerated they do make sense. The audio is quite repetitive and the music, oh the music... I'd have preferred being able to load my own music instead of listening to the garbage. I turned it off.In the end I can't recommend this game because there are newer editions out that *should* feature the onscreen multiplayer I mentioned.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Compared to newer entries in the Trials series, Trials 2 feels incredibly dated. Its lack of polish, unrefined and floaty physics, and just general quality-of-life features show just how far RedLynx have come over the years. This is a very barebones game, but it was necessary for the devs to get to the point that they're at now. As it stands, this is a decently fun little time-waster, but the Miniclip sponsorship signs in the background show you exactly what kind of mindset you should approach this with.Overall, I recommend skipping this version and picking up Trials Evolution or Fusion instead. Or, you could even play their mobile app, which is also very good.			",367,82,24,48,37,4,62

												This game easily the most brutal and unforgiving game I have ever played.  If you can mange to get it to stop crashing and freezing your graphics card, you will be treated to ridiculous elasticy physics and frustrating glitches (like your bike folding in half on a regular basis).The learning curve is extremely steep, which is reflected by the nearly impossible achievements.  In order to become half decent at Trials 2, you will need to study replays and practice infuriating sections of track for hours on end, and even then you have no hope of touching the leaderboards.So unless you have a lot of time on your hands, and like extremely difficult challenges, think again before you choose this game.

												Playing Trials 2 is like going to a restaurant, and ordering the chili.First, you're impressed.  It's pretty good!  The meat is tender, the onions and beans are flavorful, the broth is robust.Then, the cook comes out and adds some Cayenne pepper, to give it just a little spice.  Superb!  Well done!And then the cook comes out again and adds some more Cayenne pepper.  Well, I mean... why?  It's quite good the way it is.  You can still taste the other ingredients, and it's not bad, but things are kind of getting overwhelmed by the spice.And then the cook comes out once more and dumps a gallon if Cayenne pepper into your dish.  Now you're irritated, but you know there's good chili in there, right?  You take a bite, and try to ignore the spiciness, but even when you find a great big chunk of meat or something, all you can taste is spice.  Spice, spice, spice.Difficulty is good in a game.  A little spice is more than nice.  But when your game's gimmick is that it gets so difficult that you can no longer taste the enjoyable stuff, well... what's the point?  Who wants to eat THAT dish?A bad chef is one who sucks at chili.  An unforgivable chef is one who ruins good chili.  The same goes for game devs - good game, ruined because some idiot was all like ""XTREEEEEEEM MEANS HARD, RIGHT?""  I will not be purchasing any games by Red Lynx again.			",82,11,1,16,2,0,13

												I love trials games, and Trials 2: Second Edition was where it all started for me. I played this game for hours at a time, on a daily basis, for months. Endless, minimalistic fun, with plenty of achievements and leaderboards to compete for/with. If you're just getting started with Trials games, this is the perfect game for you.			",80,3,6,2,5,0,5

												Trials 2 is a ton of fun to play in short bursts. It's challenging making tricky jumps and landing at the right angles. It's also hilarious to watch as your driver crashes over and over and over again. Even when the game gets frustrating it's more difficult to notice or care because the crashes are so comically terrible. There's a nice bit of satisfaction to be had when that hard track is finally overcome. I recommend just for ♥♥♥♥♥ 'n' giggles.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have yet to find a game more frustrating and rewarding than Trials 2. It's basically the same exact motorcycle physics puzzle platformer we all played as a kid, but with a shiny new coat of paint and leaderboards. Not a bad way to spend $10.			",405,54,38,46,22,6,34

												Never have I loved a game more.  Never have I hated one so so much.  Trials can be very addicting trying to get that ""perfect run"" but at the same time oh so frustrating when you fall just short of the end.  The best part is that it is never the games fault when you fail.  And you always know it.  It is incredibly rewarding to finally get through a track without falling, or shaving off just a few tenths of a second off of your time.  It's a game that you can play when you only have 10 minutes to play, but can spend hours absorbed too.  The controls are tight.  There are only 4 buttons to push, but control is deceptively deep and nuanced.  The crashes can be hilarious.  The tracks are well designed and the difficulty ramps up appropriatly from carefree first levels to the insidiously difficult hard tracks.  There is a fairly punishing learning curve about 60% of the way through the tracks, but so satisfying when you get some of the more advanced techniques down.  Most games I get excited about have a whole lot to do with the story or the atmosphere of the game.  This is one of the very few in recent memory that stand pretty much 100% on the merit of the gameplay itself.			",477,268,11,62,20,2,54

												wow if you want the apolyptic vision of the future imagine no further. take your bike on a spin around the tracks and see what can do. you can do a flip and land it, despite yourself. don't give it too much thought just ride like romantic image of motorcycles from the books, and when you had a thought about playing this game you should.

												This is one of the most exciting and addictive game that I've already played. When you start playing, you won't stop until break your records, you'll want to be better in each track you play. And in the March 22th will be realeased the Trials Evolution: Gold Edition for PC. And will have a lot of inovations for the game be more atractive and competitive, for spend a lot of your time in the game. This game is like drugs, when you start, you'll never stop, but I think that is a good drug, or no. So, if you want a reaally good game, that will help you when you'are bored, this is the perfect choice!			",100,4,12,7,1,0,1

												I am basically a FPS gamer, however just because the price was right I downloaded TRAIL 2 and I gotta say, the game is pretty cool, good graphics and pretty addictive. For a switch of pace, try this game, its only $2.50 (12/22/2010) and its the best $2.50 game, (other than F.E.A.R) I ever spent.			",41,0,2,0,0,0,1
