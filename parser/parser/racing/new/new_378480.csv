								Yea, tell people to NOT buy a game because there isn't enough people online and give it a big fat red thumbs down?!(MAKES SO MUCH SENSE)I just got on at 7AM and the room filled up pretty quickly.  (Euro Server)It looks very much like Borderlands (semi-cell shaded).  And plays very much like P.A.M.I played a mode that was exactly Conquest Mode from Battlefield, which I love.

								review update January 4th 2017: i'm not playing this game anymore / haven't played it for like year now, so i don't know what has changed etc.if Borderlands + World Of Tanks had a baby, this game would be it. Loving the game so far.Pros: + Free to play + Has multiple vehicles to start with: 2 ground vehicles, and 2 aircrafts. More can be bought when    you play matches and increase your account level. Amount of experience which you gain after each battle for your account depends on: did your team win or lose the battle, how many enemies you killed, how many flags you captured.+ Everything can be obtained just by playing the game, so pay-to-win is not necessary.Cons:- Only few maps and 1 gamemode (Conquest)- No tutorial whatsoever, but if you have played games with vehicular combat which are similar to this one (Unreal Tournament 2004/UT3 for example) You can get the hang of things quite quickly. Just remember to check land and air vehicle controls.- Teamwork can be difficult / Very little ingame chat communication with team members. If you have nice group of steam friends to play this game with, i'm sure that things work out better (You can create a clan in this game.)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I don't know where to put this, to Pros or to Cons...but each of your vehicle has progress bar above the vehicle icon, which means you can level up your vehicles when you play battles, and you get certain amount of experience for that vehicle which you just played the battle with. Gained experience for vehicle depends on: did your team win or lose the battle, how many enemies you killed, how many flags you captured. Leveling up a vehicle increases it's armor, speed, handling, ramming damage, different damage resistances. Also, each vehicle has different stats.Borderlands (Game graphics and how vehicles look like.)World Of Tanks or Battlefield (vehicle garage looks similar to WoT, and gamemode is same too than in WoT and BF(conquest), you basically capture 3-5 flags on map and deplete enemy spawns to 0 and you don't let them capture any of the flags.)

								This game is fun.What is it like?   It is like an easy to play version of Twisted Metal, less weapons, but with upgrade and leveling options.Controls?   They aren't too bad, but somewhat clunky, until you get accustomed to them.Progress is currently tracked independently per server, no syncing yet, but it is on the way.There are a few balances issues, but what game does not have them? The fun factor outweighs any negative issues I've experienced with this game, get it, it's free.			",143,20,5,17,30,3,22

								While it's alright, it still needs a lot of work. The devs are great and listen to their fanbase, which is already a plus, and the game itself is decent, but there is signifigant room for improvement.First thing's first, it NEEDS a faster pace. For a vehicular combat game, it feels as though you're moving at a walking pace which is a huge no-no, I'd reccommend increasing the speed of every vehicle moderately.Number two is the lack of maps and decent map rotation. I am not sure how many maps there are, but I've only played four, two of which for nearly every game, both winter themed. Fix this up, game's going to be great.			",97,3,2,3,3,0,2

The more you play the game the more credits you get which allows you to add new parts, weapons and abilities.Controlling the ground vehicles using the keyboard requires some skill so controller support would be great, but i guess that's where the new Steam Controller comes in?All in all it's a fun game.

								Badland Bandits is a online multiplayer game, with varied vehicles that allows you to upgrade your vehicle in any way to beat your enemie vehicles.If you also have experienced or heard of ""world of tanks"" or ""flat out"", then imagine these games mixed up with helicopters and varied vehicles, cool designs, cool vehicles where everything goes fast, with different abilitys and upgrades.The game it self has a shop where you can buy in-game currency gold or silver, which is the currency the game uses to buy gear for your vehicle. If you win a match and kill enemys, you will automatically get an amount based on your last game. If people want to be quicker to get the items, then it's kinda ""pay-2-win""- Hold your breath - , but in the end the amount of upgrades is limited and accessable for every player. I don't see any ""special treatments"" for players to let ""pay-2-win"", destroy the game.If you are the car lover with a mixed feeling of ""world of tanks"" that you thought was too slow and don't have that fast-in-game feeling with helicopters, cool mods, upgradeable gear and different abilitys for your vehicle in a desert to blow everyone up to get the ""flat out"" feeling? Then this game is for you.Here is a demo:http://www.twitch.tv/theearlyaccess/v/7784466 ",320,27,7,19,27,2,19

I would really like to play with a full lobby but I don't see that happening anytime soon. Right now I wouldn't recommend it since you really need players to actually enjoy this. Maybe look into giving your game a little more press before releasing your game on early access. I would wait until the game fully launches, or the game picks up more players before purchasing.

Early Access Review
								You may question my low play time thinking I haven't properly reviewed the game, but in reality within the .4 hours I played I figured out everything I would ever need to know as to why you should not play this game.First off, the game on launch did not have US servers, it had only Russian ones which means the ping was so high and so bad I had no idea how to tell how the game felt whatsoever because it was so lagged due to server issues mixed with insane ping I'm shocked I got through a single battle (I got through three before uninstall). I mean for crying out loud upon launching the game my only option was to pick the Russian servers.The game plays very loose, kind of rough, and doesn’t feel good, nor is any of the fights actually fights. It feels like just driving around looking at people instead of intense car combat. Then again I have no idea how the game ACTUALLY feels because of aforementioned problems above.The worst part about this wasn’t even the fact that due to server issues and high ping because no local servers, thus making the game unplayable, no there was actually something worse. This game has reached NEAR CRITCAL LEVELS of free to play cancer. There are only a handful of vehicles available to drive and use in this game yet the devs think it’s a great idea to lock half of them behind a pay wall and make them the best in the game. That’s right folks; you can pay to instantly be the strongest. Besides that level progression is very slow, unlocking things without paying is a crap process, its worse than world of grind (world of tanks) yet clearly inspired by it.Final word: at the end of the day what you are left with is another poor attempt at making a car combat game from a buncha Russians that are world of tanks fanboys and designed their game’s everything behind an already crap f2p model but done even worse. You can buy the highest and best power in this game from the very start of the game, you can pay to win instantly, it has server issues, and the devs launched the game without US servers expecting this to be fine. No players online, matches go empty, when you finally play high pings and crap servers mixed with floaty clunky controls make this a crap experience.Don’t waste your time here.
