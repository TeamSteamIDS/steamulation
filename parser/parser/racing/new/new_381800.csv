Early Access Review
								This game appears to be in very early alpha. I feel it isn't worth even the low introductory price. I feel it simply isn't ready yet, even for Steam Early Access. Prior to purchasing, I checked out the screenshots. It reminded me of classic games like Super Sprint or RC Pro-Am, games I was a huge fan of back in the day. The potential may be there, time will tell.The game is tagged with Multiplayer and Cross-platform multiplayer, which would be great, however, the multiplayer aspects have not yet been integrated into the game. As of now, this is a major disappointment. ""That's OK"", I thought. ""I can just play against the AI""Well, there is just one problem with that: this game has no AI! In Single Player mode, all there is to do is race around the track solo, sort of a ""time trial mode"" but without the Time Trial. There is literally no incentive to do well.At this point I feel the game isn't yet in a playable state, but I do see potential here. I'm skeptical of some of the positive user reviews left thusfar. The options menu states that controllers are not yet supported. There is no support to change screen resolution. The only options available are choosing between Fullscreen and Windowed (a window that cannot be resized), and a Master Volume slider. At this point I'm going to request a refund through Steam. If at any point this game improves on some of the lacking features that I believe should be there (even in early access), I might repurchase the game and update my review as I see fit. The verdict: don't buy this game, at least not yet.One other small thing -- What's up with the artwork on the store page? This is a game about racing on ""50+ tracks across Europe"". The little guy in the artwork is holding a Califormia license plate.			",370,89,12,36,50,7,68

Early Access Review
								The game's abandoned. The dev(s) don't appear to be active, and there hasn't even been a major update yet. The game claims that it has ""6 realistic, ESC disabled drift racing cars"" which is a bit pointless in saying, as it's impossible to save enough money to buy all six cars. The game also claims to have ""50+ tracks across Europe."". Yet another lie. And finally ""Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?“We are aiming to have the final release of DRIFT 84 out 3-6 months after the early access release.” The game has been out since July 2015. It's been over a year, yet there's no visible sign of the game getting out of early access. If you're thinking of getting the game, don't. It's fun for maybe a few hours, but the lack of content stops that.			",53,5,5,4,6,1,1

Early Access Review
								I wanted to like this, gave it a few rounds. It seems like it is trying to be a mobile port complete with a potential paywall feature later, not cool. The times for each track are stupid hard and the vehicle handling needs a ton of work. If it gets an update, I'd be willing to give it another chance but for now, i would wait until the developer updates it. I understand that this is an Early Access game, but so far i am not impressed. The idea of upgrades is a nice touch and that is part of why i decided to give it a shot. I do not like that there is no controller support yet, and the auto acceleration kind of kills it.

Early Access Review
								Very generic. Basic in almost every way. I understand that the game is early access, but I don't see it really improving to a large degree. You can tell the game was built with a mobile focus. At $.49-$.99, I'd might feel better with the purchase, but for $2+, it's an easy pass.I don't mean to sound harsh to the developer, but the game feels very lazy. If you are going to put this title on the pc, there needs to be a more intricate physics model for the driving, and there is no excuse for the game looking like the art was lifted from a 2-year-old's first book on cars, that mommy picked up at the grocer's clearance rack. ""Left arrow. Right arrow. Is down doing anything? Not sure. I've seen Tiger LCD games with more intricate graphics. Mouses over game. Right clicks. Deletes local content. 100% satisfied.""Would uninstall again /10.			",292,109,13,9,42,10,15

								The drifting is handled very well, it feels ""right"" when you slide around bends. You don't control acceleration or brake, you just manage the steering. That makes it sound like it's shallow or simple but it actually feels challenging because you need to anticipate the turns. You can tune your car or keep racing to earn money to buy more. It's definitely heading in the right direction with a lot more content coming. I'll be looking forward to mp and the addition of many more tracks that hopefully brings scenery changes. Also, dat music! We need more awesome 80s music! Also, I find it very cool that this was made by the son of the guy who made Outrun for Commodore 64.Video Review & Gameplay:

Early Access Review
								What's here so far is a nice retro style drifting game similar to Supercars on the Amiga. The version I'm reviewing (on Early Access release day) is a time trial mode where you work to beat your time round numerous tracks which feature some nice hand drawn art and numerous cars and upgrades to use to try to beat your times. With multiplayer racing and more tracks promised this could turn out to be a truly great old school game. At the price it is being sold for it's a bargain.

								I didn't think I would like this as much as I did, I'm not really a drifting fan. I love driving and racing games, but never been very good with drifting.It's early days yet, but with a few tweaks and additions, this will be a great time-waster to add to your collection!

Early Access Review
								In its current form, I cannot recommend Drift 84. While the mechanics are fine, and the concept is tried and true, the game is entirely incomplete. An entire world map is viewable, but you only have a handful of stages to play. 3 races into Portugal, the second country, you are stopped from continueing.There are only 3 cars that can be reasonably accessed. The fourth car and beyond cannot be purchased without redoing the same races thousands of times over to generate the insanely high price tag. This amount of grinding is not reasonable for a casual game. Perhaps when the future tracks are accessible, they can be purchased with the higher prize money. However, in the game's current state they are unaccessible.If you are interested in purchasing this game, my advice is to wait. If the developers comes through with the updates, it could be a fun microgaming experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								For a pre-alpha, I'm having a lot of fun with it.  It reminds me of my childhood, spending hours playing games like RC Pro-Am.  There are only a limited number of tracks so far, and you can blast through them and fully upgrade a couple cars in an hour or so, but there's a lot of joy to be had in trying to master the way the cars handle.  It's really satisfying to drift around each turn perfectly.  This game has a lot of potential, and I'm really looking forward to seeing what's coming next.			",309,48,15,22,12,1,15

								I think DRIFT 84 has potential and is a good purchase if you're looking for a game to help you unwind. It's really easy to pick up, the controls are good (keyboard for now, controller support is planned for later), the audio is decent, and the difficulty curve, at least for the tracks available currently (at its Early Access launch), is well-tuned.You'll need to play a bit to be able to unlock most cars and parts but it feels satisfying, especially after tuning them. Things should be easier though with future updates as I believe you'll get access to tracks that give you higher prizes. Once you get better cars you'll also find bonus opportunities (drift, burnout), you can get NOS, so there is incentive to play although there will be farming done, if you want something better. Again, this should be addressed once more tracks are added.The game ran stable for me, no crashes, I didn't encounter any bugs and it was simply fun. If you get it one thing to definitely buy is the rainbow smoke, really worth the $1,000 (in-game cash of course).
