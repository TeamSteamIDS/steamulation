												I work as an engineer for a Formula 1 team, and what impresses me about this game is how it has captured the things which make a race weekend exciting while stripping away the stuff that would make every race weekend a chore (aka too much like a real job!).For example, the short practice sessions - lots of complaints about those but I have to say there is probably no racing team that would ever say they've had enough practice - you always want more, and it's a case of prioritising what you want to learn about. The game forces you to make this interesting choice - do you work on setup or prioritise running laps on a set of tyres to squeeze out that last few % of performance?In real life teams use a combination of experience and simulation to do the biggest chunk of setup work before the race - the practice sessions are just for fine tuning. The game gives you hints (and the track map should give you an idea) of whether this is a high speed / low speed circuit. I've found it's possible to get fairly close on your first go by taking an educated guess, but you won't get a perfect setup without long practice sessions, good driver feedback and a good starting guess - and nor should you! Getting a perfect setup is elusive just like in real life. And just like in real life you could keep a note of your setups and give yourself a better starting point for next year!There are some things that could be improved - copying setups from one teammate to another would be handy, and at the moment there is a lack of strategy tools - you can't pre-plan setups for a particular lap (so you have to remember any strategies in your head) and it's hard to figure out whether a 2 or 3 stop is faster. Changing strategy on the fly during the race is made difficult because you can't get a list or a graph of your driver's laptimes since the start (at least I haven't found one) - this would allow you to compare and see if you have more pace / less pace than the guy in front and at what point your laptimes start to fall off the cliff (so time for a tyre change).But overall I can promise you this is a really great (and fun!) impression of the real deal.

Update 2017.02.24:I've just played a couple of hours with the new 1.3 update. Some excellent changes have been added, the top in my mind is the change to qualifying to allow you to have the driver do the outlap warming of brakes and tyres rather than having you (the player) do it. Really a change that makes the whole game much better since your role in qualifying is now that of the team manager rather than also the driver too. And now there is a rules option for qualifying to change it to be like Formula One with three segments where after Q1 and Q2 the slowest part of the field is eliminated. A third, more minor but still important change is to the emails that ask for interviews from you. They now have actual effects on the drivers or team and so really mean something. And there are a host of other great changes. Makes the game even better.Update 2016.11.23: After now having played just over forty hours on the game, I can continue to give the game a positive thumbs up. I have played a season and a few races at the bottom of the three tiers of competition, and most of one season in the top tier. The game does have a few bugs which hopefully will be fixed in the first planned patch. Otherwise however it is really quite good in the long run. I would categorize the game as something you experience rather than something you play to win. I spent 19 hours in the lowest tier, and now 21 hours in the top tier where I have not yet finished my first season. You really can spend a couple of hours of real world time between the end of one race and the end of the next one. You manage finance, part design, and just running your team, including evaluating drivers and staff. And then at a race weekend you spend time preparing for practice, overseeing practice and the same for qualifying. And then comes the race and you are calling the shots for your two drivers regarding fuel use, tire wear and pit stops. Now I do tend to play slow and fret over every detail, so most folks will probably spend only half or a third of the time that I do in a season, but if you really want to get down to the nuts and bolts of running a team, this is the game for you.Original Review:My impressions after a couple hours of play...Much, much better than the mobile game. Seriously. Very seriously. I think I spent the first hour just going through the tutorial that puts you right into the first race of the season and then walks you through every menu screen and option. Really top notch presentation. There are some compromises, because it is game that has to be actually played by a single player rather than a huge team of technical specialists, but wow the developers certainly tried to give you the feel of running a race team. Little things like how your driver develops a relationship with their mechanic which improves over time. Or that you can build parts that might not pass scrutineering, which happens after each race and could get your results invalidated. Or that the series rules change over time, like different tires or removing fueling. And there was even a case of a track changing it's configuration from one season to the next. Truly an awesome effort, and this is from someone who started back in nineties with different racing management games. And so far (two hours), no glitches or crashes.			",92,12,37,10,55,1,38

												Wow!Pros:- Extremely polished (great UI, good performance, no bugs)- Visuals- AI is surprisingly smart when it comes to strategy- Finally in 3D- Much deeper than the mobile game (scouting, build your HQ, hire new mechanics and drivers,...)- 3 different series (GP2, GP3 and F1)- Good selection of tracks with different variants- Dynamic weather, safety car, virtual safety car, mechanical problems, driver errors,... SO MANY SURPRISES!- Setups are very important- You can vote on rule changes for the next season- Relaxing and stressful at the same time- Never gets boring- Drivers aren't as whiny as players in Football Manager- Focus is purely on the management side of things - no annoying driving mini games or the likes- Races are longer than 5 minutesCons:- No mod support yet- No official license- No Gt3 or endurance series- You can't create your own team, only join already existing onesHighly recommend it to anyone who likes motorsport or management games. There is no driving in this game - it is about managing your own team and your drivers.			",149,29,23,21,44,2,17

												I love it. It's rather simple and addictive, a great management game for those who love racing (I do). Don't listen to those who say it gets repetitive — surely, it is, but it's meant to be, because this kind of sports is. Pick the right setup, deal with the weather, choose the right strategy, repair, design, manage staff and sponsors — in the eyes of a fan, it's quite similar to the real world racing team's concerns.My advice, if you plan to buy it. Set the longest race length in the settings, then pick the weakest team in the lowest tier (because this is not mandatory, you can choose whoever you want), and lead them to success. This gives a nice, instructive experience, and keeps you on the edge of your seat in almost every race, because every single point does matter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Having enjoyed the mobile version of this game, I was delighted to learn that it would be released on PC.  Just like the mobile version, this game has a beautiful simplicity to it: tweak a bit, upgrade a bit, practise, qualify and race.  However, the PC version has been enhanced in every possible way.  It is now a fully fledged, thoroughly enjoyable racing manager that is STILL simple to play, yet is customisable in every way imaginable to please even the most die-hard manager-game fan.  You don't need any prior knowledge because the tutorial is detailed and excellent, and unlike many other sport manager simulations, it is a fun game regardless of whether or not you're a fan of the sport.  The user interface could not be better.  THIS is the Grand Prix of racing manager games - the one we've been waiting for.  I'm honestly running out of superlatives now, so I'll finish with a SIMPLY FANTASTIC verdict.			",238,117,21,21,132,3,67

												This game has consumed my life since I got it.The macro game is building up your team to compete and win at the highest levels. Hire a 2.5-star driver with the potential for 5 and train him/her up over time. Save up enough cash to upgrade your factory so it can improve more parts at once. Take the proceeds of winning due to upgrading your parts and buy a practice track at your HQ to help improve the skills of your drivers and pit crews. Take 1st place in the Team Championship at the end of the season and ""graduate"" up to the next tier, if you want/dare to.The mini-game is doing the best you can in each race. Manage how aggressive or passive your drivers are driving. Decide when they should come in for a pit stop, and what tires they should go out on based on the weather forecast. Otherwise, watch the race. It's pretty exciting!A mini-mini game is tweaking your car's performance before each race. It's a little bit like the Mastermind game: Take a guess with the settings and go out for one lap. Check the feedback of each item (Poor, Okay, Great, Excellent, etc.) and make small or larger adjustments to the settings and send them out again. Try to get them all to Excellent before practice time runs out. After a few tries, it's pretty easy to get them to Great which is sufficient for the race, but leaving them at Poor or worse will have a noticible effect on the race. You probably won't finish on the podium unless your car tweeks are Great or Excellent.Another mini-mini game is Qualifying. Compared to the rest of the game, this feature seems overly simple yet hard to understand. You drag a slider to try and find the sweet spot between tire heating and brake heating while your driver goes around the track. I've never found it.In-game Emails/Twitter, sponsorship deals based on team marketability, media interviews that can affect team morale, employees having secret affairs or starting a modeling career on the side. A lot of depth that makes the game very immersive for a management sim.Some negative reviews complain about things that the game lets you address:- Parts failing during races: You can upgrade their reliability at the factory. AI cars break down often in the early season too, and you can use that to your advantage by driving easy and winning by attrition. Also, HQ and Parts Designer upgrades let you build more reliable parts without having to upgrade them at the factory.- Drivers doing well in one race, then poorly in the next: Each track requires different skills from drivers, and different car parts to perform effectively. If you have a killer engine in an otherwise basic car, you'll do well in Milan but not so much in Yokohama where the cutback curves require more acceleration (gearbox) and deceleration (brake) performance than sheer top-speed. Drivers also have cornering and overtaking skills (among several others), and they are considered on a per-track basis by the game.- I think I've *maybe* seen the blue flag thing. You're about to lap a slow-poke but he won't get out of the way. For me it hasn't really affected much. My driver has always been able to overtake him within a half a lap or less. Maybe it's been patched since those reviews came out.Overall this game scratched an itch for me in a major way. I can't recommend it enough for anyone who likes management sims.

												Let me make one thing clear from the start. I'm from the era of the original motorsport manager games, mainly Grand Prix Manager 1 & 2 and Grand Prix World. Just so you understand what I'm comparing Motorsport Manager to. Great 'MicroProse' Formula One management games that were made very well.So instead of dragging out the paragraphs, I'm going to use a 'Pros and Cons' system for my opinion of the game.Pros:- Depth that lasts season after season. (Lastability)- A simple but effective layout of most interactive screens.- Ability to apply for management jobs in other teams.- Three progressive divisions.- Nice looking graphics, especially during races.- Multiple different strategies that can be applied during races, and even in-between races.- Interesting way of designing new parts and improving parts.- Good way of implementing pre-season testing in the flow of the game.- Rule changes you can vote on that can have a massive effect on the structure of the game, series to series.- Overall well balanced racing manager game.- The simple fact of having the first good racing management game in seventeen years.Cons:- Good management, but not really micro-management.- Limited to a maximum of three sponsor options per slot.- Very limited car retirement/crashes during races. (Really only pull in the pits or park off circuit, no real crashes)- No spins or offs or mistakes from drivers, as such.- Ineffective blue flags and back markers constantly ruining your race.- Very little explanation on how some things work.- The constant unrealistic lines your driver takes when 10-20 car lengths behind a backmarker.- Little variety in email texts. As in responses to race wins, new team jobs, etc.- Other little bugs like incorrect budget numbers, safety car in middle of track, etc.I realize that most of the cons are nitpicking, but isn't it the accumulation of little things what makes the whole enjoyable? I think so, hence the nitpicking. Not to say this isn't an enjoyable game, because it clearly is shown in the amount of hours I've spent and will continue to spend playing this game.All-in-all an excellent game with a bunch of cons that can be fixed/altered if Playsport Games so desired. Access to steam workshop would be excellent by the way.---------Updated since December 2016 patch: A fix for the backmarkers that works a treat. Sometimes drivers drive through the slower cars, which is obviously not all that good. And of course Steam workshop has been granted for early 2017, hooray!			",125,75,16,34,28,2,15

												Played about 4 hours today. Wow. The only thing I wish it had that is currently missing is the ability to plan pit strategy before the race. Other than that everything else is there, even things I didn't know I wanted like the ability to vote for rule changes for future seasons. The game allows you to customize and experiment with so many aspects of racing and team management while still keeping it simple. Can't recommend this game enough if you are a racing fan and especially if you are an F1 fan. If your computer can run it buy it.			",12,8,1,0,1,0,0

												(Note:  Do not let the amount of time Steam says I've played this game fool you.  I'm almost always offline when I play.  Besides, I don't believe I could unlock nineteen achievementsat the time of this writing.)Management sims are my favorite genre of games and I love Formula One, so this game immediately took over possession of my heart, life, and soul.  I strongly recommend this game to any fan of management simulations.  And what if you don't like Formula One or auto racing?  Then you'll be more forgiving of some of the game's flaws than I am!Motorsport Manager contains three tiers of open-wheel auto racing leagues called the World Motorsport Championship (obviously a play on Formula One) and two inferior leagues known as the Asia-Pacific Challenge Cup and the European Racing Series which are more regional and not based off of any real life motorsports association.The World Motorsport Championship contains the likenesses of real life Formula One teams and drivers in 2015.  If you know Formula One, it isn't difficult to match up teams to their real life counterparts.  Several of the drivers are female (unlike their real life counterparts), but if you know Formula One, you can tell easily enough who the Australian woman racing for Panther Race Team is supposed to be, along with Dieter Wexler and Niilo Saarinen who drive for Scuderia Rossini.  Circuits are also much like their real  life counterparts, yet anything but identical.  The closest any of the circuits come in this game to the locations of their real life counterparts is Singapore, but it isn't difficult to guess at which race is which in real life with the exception of the Cape Town Grand Prix.  It took me awhile to see the resemblance to the Monaco Grand Prix, but anyone familiar with the Monaco Grand Prix will eventually see the resemblance.Although management sims are hardly graphics-dependent (I can amuse myself for hours with text-based games), the graphics of Motorsport Manager go above and beyond aesthetically pleasing.  The layouts of the track and scenery around it never gets old to see.  The graphics would have been better if more 3D angles were provided than merely a camera that follows the desired car.  The direction and pitch of the camera can be changed, but apart from the lack ability to zoom-in incredibly close, I would have liked it better if the game allowed for TV style viewing and (even better) a view of the race from a driver's cockpit camera.  But the worst part about the graphics, is the fact that you will occasionally see cars travel straight through one another.  Another flaw to graphics, is that the numerals on cars featured on the track map are all white, which naturally, makes this difficult to read on lightly colored dots.  (""Metal on metal"" in the case of white on yellowish colors.)  Screens between races are rarely exciting, but that's management sims for you.  However, the screens for HQ and Sponsors are pleasing to the eye.Being a management sim, sound is even less important than graphics to me.  Just for the sake of writing a review, I played this game with the sound on...  Once!  The races all sound just like the V-8 engines of Formula One before 2014, though this may be a negative for any gearheads playing this game, because the World Motorsport Championship uses V-10 engines, and V-10 engines all make a distinctive whine.  The music doesn't help set the mood, but at the same time, the music doesn't sound out of place.  But it's easy to enjoy Motorsport Manager with the sound off, and listen to your favorite sort of music while making between-race decisions and watching in-race action.There's much I would like to share about my game experiences, except that Steam puts a limit on reviews.  (I would like to see Steam put a minimum number on words for reviews.  Single word reviews here are comonplace, and jackwagons who write them seem to think they're actually being helpful!)  My list of positives and negatives are anything but all-inclusive, so I'm unable to share other important details that may also be important to the reader.  (Particularly the lack of Formula One rules applied to the game...  Even the stupid ones, like the current ""engine"" formula and the maximum engine rule.)The biggest positives of this game have to be the large variety of buildings you can build for your team headquarters.  (Though a single ""administrative office"" is mysteriously absent.)  Weather patterns (including temperature) are flawless, and the in-race and random events that happen between races that affect a driver's skills (either temporarily or permanently), moods, and health are something to belove.  I was skeptical when I noticed there wasn't a driver skill dedicated to wet weather racing, but then I saw this intergrated into driver traits.  (If a driver has the trait when the condition is active, they will receive bonus points to their skills.)  I also love how practice actually means something!  I really enjoy the challenge of making a car that's ""built to win."" (My apoligies to Seta.)  Elections are always fun, and I enjoy the possibilities.  (Including the ability to accept bribes from another team's chairman to vote their way.)On the downside, the movement of cars during races is often nothing short of unrealistic for any sort of racing series that I'm familiar with.  The game makes no obvious mention of how much money a player may overdraft, and loans cannot be secured.  (Overdrafting is a must for building up a team, especially a weak team!)  While interviews are an important part of the game to fans of sports management sims, the interview sessions are deeply flawed.  There's frequently only three choices for answers, and none of them are ""no comment.""  Interviews rarely seem to factor in if a driver had overachieved in an inferior car, and post-race interviews are only two questions long, and with no ability to clarify one's answer.  I also highly disagree with the fact that parts other than the front wing can be repaired in the middle of races.  This isn't supposed to be endurance racing, and this takes away from the ability to have races with high rates of attrition. If this option had to be included, the game should have included ""meatball flags."" I particularly hate the system of promotion and relegation.  This isn't Soccer, and only three leagues (and thirty teams) is far to few to make promotion and relegation viable.  Promotion and relegation may be viable if one is playing the ""challenge mode"" of this game, but the game should require a promoted team satisfy a number of requirements in addition to finishing first.  (That is, have certain buildings and facilities upgraded to a minimum number.  Maybe even require a team have a certain amount of money on-hand.)  To be fair to the other teams, a relegated team should have their buildings operate at a reduced level to a league's maximum.  Sixteen locations is far too few places for races, and the ERS and APCC should not have races outside of their region.  I was skeptical when I saw there was no skill for race starts, and for good reason:  The programmers had no idea what they were doing in this important stage of a race.  (Especially since erratic starts do not result in multi-car pile-ups similar to the 2012 Belgian Grand Prix.)  Excellent starts on the other hand, are thwarted by a driver simply slowing down to match the speed of the car ahead, while even people who don't watch auto racing would know for a fact the faster car would try and pass the car ahead of them!Simply put, if you're a fan of management simulations, this is the game for you regardless of your interest in motorsports.    While the erratic movement of cars and lack of blue flags for drivers who have just exited the pits with a faster car approaching drives me crazier than a laughing hyena on crack rock, this still does not take away from the fact that this is one truly amazing management simulation.

												It's the 4X RTS of Formula races.It's the ""One more Turn"" of motorsports.But a ""turn"" here is a race weekend.Between those races, you have to take care of your mount, discover and buy new buffs for ""her"".You must X-pand your castle and your realm, plan your strategies while you X-plore the Motorsport world and ensure that all the people that you X-ploit (and the two dumb knights kindly allowed to ride the beautiful roaring steeds that you raised yourself) are satisfied, and are always improving in their fields.Or you can fire their peasant asses if they're not worth the money, because in this game you also have to be an accountant.And after that, the X-termination is on the track.The races are awesome, you can really see and hear your ""Pilot-Knights"" react in real time, and all your decisions have a true and direct impact, from your vote at a Team Assembly or the number of people working on a chosen upgrade to the numerous real time ""micro management"" on track. Overall the game is very ""lively"" and never boring, even during long races. (Actually I enjoy the long races more)And you can be a big bragging jerk during interviews apparently.It must be noted that the tutorial is really good at teaching all the basics.All that's ""missing"" for me is a closer view during the races, and the radio messages should stay onscreen longer, (but you can pause, it pauses the messages as well...)It's the first racing management game I've played in my life (I'm older than Jesus when he died the first time), and it became one the best Strategy/RPG/Action game I've ever played.I love it, I already missed a night of sleep to play it, and I don't want to sleep anymore because I want to progress. I've started by the bottom, the European Championship with a bottom-tier car. Maybe if I quit my job, sleep 6 hours every 2 days and eat raw potatoes for a year or two, then I should have the time to win the World Motorsport Championship.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												35 hours into this game, although I have barely scratched the surface of this game (being only season 2 of my first ever campaign), I have enough of a play through to be able to rate this.  This game is ideal for me as I enjoy motorsport, management, business simulations and strategy. Having waited over a decade for a worthy successor to the wonderful Grand Prix Manager series, this game finally brings the motorsport management simulation genre up to date!  I can see myself putting in 100’s of hours into this game and it’s very refreshing to see a developer price the game FAIRLY without needing to do large discounts or rip off buyers.  I would value the game at around £34.99 but the full price is £24.99, so there is good value to be had here for buyers.The key features of the game are working as the manager of a single seater racing series team you need to keep the chairman of the team happy.  This comes from meeting his expectations – for some teams he expects you to finish last, other times you’ll have a target to achieve in the races.  Also in the races you’ll have a marketing target – hit a position at the finish and you’ll get a bonus of cash.   You do well in races by hiring good drivers.  It’s tough in negotiations, and you have to think very carefully, as a small team, what you want to spend on drivers vs their skill.  Some drivers will refuse to negotiate. Also you will hire chief mechanics (who get better the more they work with a driver and they can deliver race bonuses), and a chief designer (who can add special parts to cars and each have their own bonuses which you need to carefully consider).  In between races you can pay the designer some hefty funds to build parts and the mechanics will work on making them better in performance and reliability for the races.  You have MANY (expensive) options to build facilities, from factory and test track to a theme park.  Each building gives you bonuses and allows you to build better parts, scout new drivers easier, better weather forecasting, etc. All the while you have to save money for next years’ car – the more you save the better options you’ll have next season. Some nice features that add to immersion are modern e-mail inbox, twitter feed after sessions, you get to vote in the management meetings to set the rules for next season.  To keep afloat you’ll need to work on building a marketing rating, the drivers you select will heavily reflect on this using their traits (e.g. if they are a ‘model’, have a ‘famous father’, like 'motor racing sims').  Better results and a better marketability allows you to attract better sponsors who pay more cash. At the end of the season you’ll get creative and design a livery for your car, a nice feature to colour it as you wish. The races themselves are immersive, and you can play short races or long races lasting over 40 laps in real time (so the race could take 45 minutes or over 1 hour to play if you go for the long setting, but there are 3 speed settings in the race, even on top speed it can be a long race). You’ll participate in practice sessions to work on your set up (which you will have to get right), and, if the rules permit, qualifying. There are 3 series to participate in – a European Series (which currently uses reverse grids based on the current league table), an Asia Series and a World Series (equivalent to F1). The races feature crashes and safety cars, changeable weather (requiring tyre changes to wets/intermediates), pit stops for refuelling and tyres, break downs, run out of fuel, drive through penalties and after race penalties for illegal car parts.  Everything a F1/Motorsport fan would expect.  The graphics are not bad and a nice improvement on Grand Prix Manager. Yes, there can be improvements made. This game has only just been released so will need some patching. In my view the changes required are minor tweaks only. My main hope for the future is the developers stick with this game and we get good steam workshop and DLC – hopefully sports car series, perhaps motorbike racing, touring cars, more tracks (maybe a national series such as a UK series)? The limits are endless to truly make this a ‘motorsport manager’.The game also includes trading cards.  For those worried about required specs, like I was, there is not so much need to panic.  The actual download required is around 6GB.  My laptop is a good few years old and within the bottom quartile of machines for performance, but still plays this game fine.  The initial spec requirements were very cautious.In summary, for business/motorsport/strategy fans this is a 9/10 MUST BUY GAME! The 21st century version of Qvadriga (with a LOT more features than Qvadriga – this is everything Qvadriga should be), and the sports management version of Civilization – building a racing empire from scratch (if playing Predator Racing), with each race having a ‘just one more turn’ feel. 'One more click' to move on time in the office to see what happens the next day and week…. Don’t delay, buy today - NOMINATED FOR A STEAM AWARD!			",3,13,2,11,26,0,14

												I have to say, this game has been better than I had anticipated. It grabs you early on and really gets you to engage in it, depending on the team you play as of course.Pros1) Driver Skill System - Realistic & rewarding to see drivers growing as you are growing when you pick up the game. Albeit the improvements are a little slow.2) Strategies - The diversity on race strategies makes the race always the most interesting thing in the game. Should I 2 stop and pound my tyres or nurse them and 1 stop and save 20 seconds of pitlane time?3)Expectations - At no point did I really feel like the expectations are too unrealistic, at least for a prolong period of time. In other games the expectations are far too unrealistic(Looking at you F1 2016) but this seems fair enough.4) Voting on rules system - Phenomenal feature. Should I look to bring in Belgium due to it suiting my powerunit or keep Monaco because I have state of the art brakes? Do I want the gripiest tyres even if they cost a lot of cash to see my drivers going flat out? You can try to influence the rules in your favour!5) Overtakes - Some of the overtakes are Verstappen like. And the battles sometimes are amazing to watch even at 3x speed! I can't emphasis enough how awesome some of the wheel to wheel battles my drivers have had and I'm in my 4th season.6) Interface - Quite nice, slick and not too clunky7) Car Development - Rewarding and it's not too pick on quickly and get it over with. You need to think how you want to develop your car. For eg. my number 1 driver excels in qualifying. So to further improve his chances I developed a gearbox with a ""qualfying mode"" (+40 Accel in Quali trait) to help him get as far up the grid as possible.8) Finances tab - Can plan budget well and make educated decisions for the future9) Some F1 Cameos being females - heheuheuheuheh looking at you Nina Holz.10) Pre Season - Very good. Enjoyable, purchasing the ""right"" suppliers is key to how the season will unfold. Shall I go with a Steinmann with better improvability or a more powerful Rossini engine?Cons1) Interviews - These are so terrible that after 3 you see the same stuff. Not to mention they always think your driver performed below par when they had a cracker. Please work on this as this is the most annoying thing in the game.2) Sponsor system - It's not bad but it'll never come close to the system Grand Prix World had which made you spent time chasing sponsors. Here you get offers and you just pick the best financially.3) China track - Buggy. Lead driver sometimes gets a lap on everyone else4) Bernie - He's a complete and utter &*$% who keeps voting against what I want.5) Scouting system - This is also awful. Literally start up the game and scout anyone. Before you scout you should be looking to target someone but since you haven't a clue on anyone's stats or potential you are blind to everything. Needs a big overhaul.6) Facilities - Doesn't feel engaging and I have barely looked at it. Literally feels like you get money and then buy them and that's it. Doesn't feel like you need to target one in particular. Also scouting centre is pointless.All in all, very impressive first crack at a full management sim. I'm happy with my investment and if you have a longing to play a decent F1 like management sim since Grand Prix World way back in 1999 then look no further.8/10 ",40,5,8,8,10,2,11

Motorsport ManagerShould come with a health warning, its that addictiveI have been waiting for a good Motorsport managing game since the release of Microprose Grand Prix Manager 2 in 1996. But this type of management game has been in serious decline. However now in 2016 it looks like the management games are coming back. With the release of titles like Transport Fever, Planet Coaster and Motorsport Manager in one year and all of them doing great in the reviews, the age of the manager game may be back.I followed this game since I heard of it as I was not confident it would be done right as there have been some ""other"" manager sims in the void since 96 but they have all sucked. After watching lets plays and seeing the reviews I decided to go for it. The lets plays did not do it justice, its better in every way.If you love your management games and racing this game is for you. It makes you want to play more and progress your team. The whole ""One more turn"" effect applies to this game, so much so that I set a record for my longest session ever, at around 12 hours and over 36 hours played in the first 3 days of owning it. I don't remember the last time I was so addicted to a title.I have played 5 seasons now in career and have stayed in the bottom league so far despite having opportunities to move up. You can take a team and build it to make it better and when you want to move up you do not have to leave your team. If your team does well enough the whole team and all its staff can be promoted to the next league. Even though I have stayed put for 5 seasons with 2 teams the years rules change, drivers, staff and teams move up or down, every year has been different with new challenges.The development is fantastic. Develop your headquarters to train your staff and designers and make better factories to make better and more reliable components. Push the limits on the rules by making risky parts and hoping you don't get caught by the governing body if you want.The drivers have permanent and temporary traits which change throughout the season. They can develop rivals, get injured, have affairs, get in to fights, find god and even get addicted to video games to name a few.Manage cash flow with sponsors and wages ensuring you can afford to make a competive car for the next year and that you can develop your insanely expensive HQ.At this time I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this game, apart from the scary amount of time I have spent on it in such a short time.Kudos Sega & Playsport, take a bow.Freerider-Dave ",127,29,30,7,28,0,22

												For a long time we didn't have a decent game in Motorsport Management genre, and now we do. It lacks in depth a bit, and seems maybe a little too simple, at least for me. While I seen posts on the forum that say that the game is too hard, so, if you like motorsport and management games, go ahead and buy this one!			",148,44,12,13,35,2,35

												This turned out to be huge fun.I've never followed F1 or GT motorsports but the game draws the player in kind of like Football Manager does even for someone who knows nothing about ""soccer football"" <grin>.It is a management game, not a driving simulation.It doesn't have any F1 etc licensing so you will not see names or images of famous racing teams, drivers, mechanics, designers, events(?) etc. It is all fictitious except maybe some of the track layouts not sure.It is a simulation-oriented game and even though I know nothing about motorsports I'd certainly call it ""evocative"". Maybe the only thing missing from that evocation is the carnival atmosphere you hear about from real-life spectators of the sport.I enjoy the race strategy. I do see it as a little bit mathematical (for me that is a good thing), you have to figure out the fixed fuel-per-lap burn rates in the game for different engine settings (which takes a few laps of your first race) and balance those against ""tyre"" wear rates that depend on driver, temperature, track etc.There are a couple ways I've played this. Aggressive, once your parts have enough reliability, you use the fact that fuel weighs more than the time to add it in the pit stop (the big time consumption of a pit stop is entering and exiting the pit lane) and run high output with just enough fuel levels to cover the time it takes the softest slick to wear down. Or conservative, you use the fact that that pit lane entry and exit time is worth a second of lap time over many laps, so you load up on fuel for the long haul and conserve fuel and ""tyre"" wear as much as possible to minimise the number of pit stops. You can see there is some balancing to work out here and depending on your team and drivers and car the same strategy may work sometimes and not others.There are some quirks I've noticed. Some probably intended, some not. I'm going to give a lot of verbage to these because I don't see a lot of discussion about them, but don't let me convey that I don't very much like the game and rate it one my best Steam purchases.There are some annoying dialog issues that make no sense. Like one that asks you to ""bring in"" a driver that beat yours, and gets them mad when you refuse, but they happen to already be your other driver. So either answer you ♥♥♥♥ off one of your drivers. Not that unavoidable ego issues are not part of the sport (they are a big part of this management sim) but the pretext in this case is absurd. However, okay, that is not huge deal and I'm sure in some future patch it will be handled.Also, your first set of ""tyres"" in a race will start at a lower temperature than every other set put on the car at a pit stop. I know nothing, but maybe this is due to the time sitting still on the grid in the starting lane until the lights go out?The second and subsequent seasons all the cars start with very poor reliability parts, much worse than the first season. To the point where it doesn't seem like the intention of the design. I'd almost expect it to be the other way around. Note that the AI has the same issues here - first races of the season are fraught with mechanical issues for them too.The part design tool tips state unequivocally you unlock slots on design iterations. This is not actually technically how it works. You only unlock the next slot when you use one of the highest-grade components. That one is really annoying but just because the instructions mess you up a little in a long-term way (the perpetual chase of improving parts design is one of the main game aspects).Finally I will caution you that the game (at least since the GT patch if not before) has a serious actual bug, however, which I hope the developers will read about and fix.When the 1st place, or perhaps other, driver is a lap (or laps) ahead of a chasing car, and that chasing car pulls ahead, the game bumps the former-chaser's time by one whole lap all of a sudden (you can see the seconds whiz by on the upper left display). This effectively jumps that car up a lap and in some cases a car which has been lapped can even take the lead this way. Not sure it *always* happens (it is a busy game) but I've seen it 5 or 6 times now and have confirmed what seems to be other plays who have seen it (see link below).For what I suspect is another example see...https://www.reddit.com/r/MotorsportManagerPC/comments/5cmf75/annoying_bug_at_beijing_gp/This sounds like the same thing they just didn't notice how it happend.

												* * Update - having been too busy to play for a while (a 5 week period) I had another crack at this and have been blitzing it again recently... I also become a bit of a Team Principal god, with 5 WMC team championships under my belt... I was starting to get a little too used to the routine of my seasons though (not bored, just too familiar) and so I changed teams and decided to have a crack at a mid tier team in the WMC, to pull them up by the boot laces. This has re-ignited my passion for the game and having now completed 5 races in the new season, I have secured 2 podiums already. Loving it and considering I won 5 WMC titles in a row (with a Red Italian team), including one season where I achieved 15 out of 16 wins (30 podiums that year too), I cannot believe that I am now again just as pumped to finish a race, avoid a DNF, get some lowly points and grab two (lucky'ish) 3rd place podiums. My target is 6th overall this season, following years as the Champion... this is weirdly as exciting to me as winning week after week.Very cool game, keeps you hooked whether winning regularly, competing in midfield or struggling to grab a point, any point. Awesome... * *  * * * * * * * This is perhaps the most enjoyable game I have played since I beat my Football Manager addiction.I bought this and whilst I don't get loads of time to play, with a young family, I somehow racked up 74 hours in a few weeks and have unlocked 50% of the achievements so far. you know a game has grabbed you when you go to bed thinking about set up and driver contract renewals! I love games that are not impossible but give you a real tough challenge. I love games that let my inner statto shine through and I love seeing what happens when I tinker with set up. I have scribbled notes, pages long with optimum set ups for teams, drivers, cars etc. and have enjoyed scouring this community for some great guides too.I have geniunely had a couple of happy 'fist pump' moments with this game too. For example, I won the Euro Series constructors title by 4 points at the last race of my third season and was really chuffed with myself. I have to remember this is only a game! My drivers were 2nd and 5th but I won the trophy I wanted. Then when I moved into the Asia series, strewth, I struggled and was binned after 2 races by my chairman (this felt more like a weird bug in the game tbh). But from there I moved on to another Asia series team and spent two seasons there before winning that constructors championship (and my driver won the drivers title) giving me a real sense of satisfaction. In the Asia series I had my first (and only!) Pole Position and was so happy I was: ""yes yes yes"" whilst pumping my fists! Like I say, I'm getting into this game. Then I moved into the World series and I am currently on race 5 of a very hard season but my driver (Zoe Sharp) just scored our first points of the season, with 2 in the bag. Amazing that this game gets you so engrossed that you are as satisfied when you get a huge result of a point at the back, as well as a win, a pole, a championship.I would love to see on the home player tab, even more career stats. I am currently on:Euro Series - 30 races - 20 podiums - 11 winsAsia Pacific Series - 31 races - 11 podiums - 5 wins WMC 4 races completedWhat would be great is to see that as well as these stats, I want to see how many Poles, Fastest Laps and Points Scoring races listed too. Also I would love to see the Driver championship trophies listed (there has been one for me). After all, like Wins, I was the team principal who oversaw all of these other achievements, so it would be good to see these.Overall, I am thoroughly enjoying this game so far.			",23,0,2,0,0,0,0

												Awesome, simply brilliant.  I have never took the time to write a review but forced myself for this.  I am an F1 fanactic and love strategy, management building games so maybe i am a little biased.  I play and love all types of games, Fifa, PES, F1, assetto corsa, stock car, Automobilista, Pcars etc etc, I love modding the heck out of all my games Ama, etc etc.I have been waiting since i am 16 for a great F1 manager game and never understood why no one was making.  I am 35 now lol.Anyway, I will cut to the chase.Pros = Everything, game is awesome and a must buy, cant wait to start modding it.Cons = Practice needs more time, more options on car livery design and sponsor colour and design would be much better.PRESS THE ADD TO CART BUTTON :)			",7,0,7,1,2,1,5

												Feels like a worthy successor to Grand Prix Manager 2...FINALLY! Just going through the tutorial, starting from barebones basics and giggling as each new nuance was revealed was fantastic. This game seems to have a lot of depth. It seems like there is a lot of strategy to manage and a lot of fun stuff to play around with to try to manipulate a good result.It feels like Grand Prix Manager 2 updated 20 years! The UI is snappy and inuitive, the tutorial is exhaustive (and necessary, given all the depth!) the races are pretty and tense. There's a ton of data, and I think more will be unlocked when the HQ is upgraded.Yeah, I'm excited. It seems like they NAILED a genre that has been waiting for someone to nail it for literally 20 years. THANK YOU!			",97,32,13,13,66,3,32

Just one more race, I swearMotorsport Manager is a management game that is very reminiscent to the Football Manager series and Grand Prix World. It's very addicting, because of its challenging difficulty and progression, its simplistic, yet in-depth gameplay and the variety in each season/tier that reduces the general repetitiveness. Every choice you will make can have a huge impact on your career, both outside and during races.If you like managing, planning and watching your drivers race to the podium, you should keep an eye on this one (you don't even need to be a F1 fan to appreciate it). I wouldn't recommend it to the ones looking for a hyper-realistic, complete sim experience, but this game does succeed in retaining the authenticity of motorsport.It does have a few game-breaking bugs that must be fixed at the moment, but I heard patches are coming soon that hopefully address those problemsPROS+ Simple but challenging and addictive gameplay+ Lots of choices to make and variety during each season+ 3D Graphics and attention to detailCONS- Cars in the races don't act much realistically- Extremely repetitive interview system- General bugs ",366,44,32,18,32,5,30

												A fun manager game that is worth the price. It could have had a bit more realism and more detailed mechanics, but it is an enjoyable game for it's price. The graphics looks decent too. The 'depth of field' (zoom blur) is a bit to much for my taste and the camera zoom is almost non existant, but other than that it looks alright.The weak part of the game are all the texts in the game (and scripted text mechanics - emails etc). After 1 race I already got an email of my 'lead designer' that I should fire my 2nd driver (that finished ahead of the 1st driver)... because my 2nd driver was to much 'on the phone'. Come on, thats just silly. And more of that silly text stuff you see in the game. If you decide to buy the game I do recommend you to skip the tutorial and just figure the UI out on the go. The Tutorial is well intended by the devs, but it treats you to much like you have never played a game before... after 2 hours you still get text pop ups pointing out the most obvious stuff.The game also recieves patches and new content for many more play hours.

												You can tell that this game was made by people who enjoy motorsport for people who enjoy motorsport.  I think I have put in nearly 50 hours in barely over a week.  There hasnt been a game that monopolized my free time like that in many years.Basically you become the team boss of an F1, F2, or F3 analog team.  You run HQ, the drivers, the car development, staff, and of course the race itself.  I wont go into great details, but its engrosssing and addictive.  Even media, rule voting, and scouting of drivers play a crucial role, and change from year to year while maintaing continuity across all divisions, teams, and, individuals.  You could concievably play forever as I am not aware of a year cap. I prefer to start at the bottom and work my way up in games such as these, and I am currently 5 season deep with ZRT.  They are an F3 outfit that are ranked 9 out of 10 at the begining, were now up to around 4th-5th, but I am looking to move to another team soon I think as I dont see ZRT being able to win a champianship anytime soon.  Maybe a move to F2 is in my future?  Did I mention you can apply for the boss job at other teams? All in all, its an amazing game.  The only negative thing I will say is that there are bugs.  They are not game breaking, at least not for me.  But from going through the discussion and bug reporting boards they are for some people.  However, as the majority of the reviews state, the enjoyment factor is through the roof regardless.9/10 with the bugs, and absolute 10/10 once they are taken care of.			",30,1,5,7,21,0,13

												I have never really played a management game that I've liked.  I have also tried previous racing management games and none of them were really worth the time it took to install them and try them out.  I would make it through a couple race weekends and then give up because they weren't fun, didn't have decent graphics, and wouldn't have many of the features that you would think were essential.  Then I found Motorsport Manager.This game is the first management game that has truly captured my interest, and has provided an excellent challenge.  The graphics are good for this type of game, and the rain effects are excellent when weather rolls in.  I'm about 20 hours in, and in my second season with ZRT in the European series, and I just got my first race win with a car that's good for 9th out of 10 and had no business controlling a race from the front, and it was excellent.  This is a game about decisions, both in and outside of the races, including who you hire, what developments or upgrades you choose, along with split second decisions during the races.  As a player who generally prefers to get out my steering wheel and do laps on a simulator when I want to get my racing fix, this has genuinely been a pleasant surprise.  This game almost has that Civilizatoin 5 thing going on where you sit down and say you're just going to do one race, and next thing you know hours have gone by and you've finished most of a season.  The developers are also quite active on both reddit and in the steam community, and they've been very receptive of feedback.  These guys want to make this game as good as it can be.  10/10 great game.			",122,24,7,12,28,1,16

												After about 3-4 hours of playtime, I can say this game is exceeding expectations in a lot of ways. I'm not typically one for manager games, they typically bore me and I find the lack of depth to be a big barrier for my enjoyment. After some dated experiences with iGPManager (An all-online GP team manager) and fiddling with the mobile game (which is fun, but only for about a week), I pre-ordered this with the hope that it would scratch the itch to have a deeper world to dive into.Now, I saw a lot of potential from the mobile game, but this is another level beyond what I imagined. As an avid fan of motorsports on an international level, it is rare any video game released has truly done the sport justice. They usually miss a few things, or dumb too many things down for accessibilities' sake. This game has missed nothing. I haven't completed a whole season yet and haven't gotten to all the features, but when I saw this game has depth, I mean it. You could bury it all the way at the bottom of Mariana Trench and it'd still out-crest Mt. Everest. Maybe it's just the excitement talking, and maybe it'll start to get repetitive, but with bi-monthly votes for rules changes, constant upgrades and expansions to facilities, and the dynamicism of the races, I doubt it. I think I've found my home in the manager games market.With that said, I still do consider this game to be accessible to the masses. The tutorial started to get a bit naggy to me as I got off and going, but it is presented in a pleasant and ultra-informative way. I have no doubts you could pick this game up and play with no motorsports knowledge, although you will learn a lot along the way. A suggestion to all, fans of racing or not, poke around all the menus, and read all the tutorial screens, and peek at all the tooltips. There is no way to have too much information in this game of milliseconds.There are tons of buffs and nerfs that drivers either possess for their life, or for short times based on life events. I scouted one driver that was down on focus because of his secret affair. Another driver was labelled as a 'scaredy cat' and was not keen on overtaking or braking. Also, all of the personnel have histories, some reaching back decades. They've worked for previous teams and can even bring over knowledge as you progress. The negotiations for hiring new staff are, in my opinion, robust, as well as the relationship and morale systems for drivers, mechanics, and teammates.There are more things to this game, single race mode and challenges, but I haven't even had time to look into them. I'm currently enamored by all the work I have to do to push my tier 3 team to the top of the standings so I can take over the next championship, on my way to world domination.If I had any nits to pick, it would be the lack of customization. You pick an existing team, and go from there. Perhaps there is a chance to run a team from scratch, but I couldn't find it. However, that is more realistic for the majority of cases, not many managers start their own team. Regardless, changing the logo and colors, and even the name would be a welcome feature. Also, unless front and rear wing changes affect the looks (my series currently has sepc front and rear wings) the car is always looking the exact same. Not that it sits front an center very often, but sometimes the details play a big role in immersion.TL;DR: This ♥♥♥♥ is deep, and it's good ♥♥♥♥.For $35USD, this is well worth it to ANY motorsports fan, especially an avid watcher of Formula 1 or WEC. You'll notice a lot of tracks are familiar, and there are lots of nods to the real world throughout the game. The developers truly are manic fanatics, and it has turned into one of the best motorsports gaming experiences I've had. If you catch this on sale by at least 25% and have any passing interest in racing or manager games, oh God please do yourself a favor and buy it.			",42,8,27,0,9,1,1

												This is a game where you are the manager of a racing team.  You pick the drivers, the sponsors, the mechanics, lead designers, your car appearance (after the first season or pay in-game monies), your home base buildings and upgrades, and whether you wish to push your drivers to driving their cars harder or easier.  In addition, things happen that need your attention such as interviews, scolding your drivers, car malfunctions, etc...So, overall, a very interesting game.  Not exactly action packed as it has more attention to decisions and the way your decisions impacts the future of your team.  The best way to describe it would be a leaning cross between actually watching a race (more so) and being behind the wheel in a race (minimal).So here are some pro's and con's...Pro's+Once you pay an in-game fee or after completion of each season, you can pick up to about 17 different designs for your car.  And yes, you can pick different colors....+You make the decisions.  You can choose multiple different things.  Some may hurt you.  Some will benefit you.+Has two different views to the races.  a 2D version and a 3D version.  for graphic reasons if you don't have ""enough"" for your system to handle.+Drivers can ""grow"" on you.  Outside things they do can benefit their abilities for a bit or hamper them.  You can rpg this to some extent with your imagination.  Some drivers are ♥♥♥♥♥.  Others are nice.  Some crash a lot.  Others don't.  etc...+Decisions on pitting, how much to push your cars and/or drivers plays a serious impact on overall performance of each race.+Contract negotiations.  You can hire rookie drivers, ""steal"" drivers from another team, or re-negotiate contracts with your current drivers.  Same goes for mechanics.+If you are tired of one team, you can always go looking to get hired by another.  This also goes the other way.  If a team doesn't like your decisions or your not fulfilling your agreements, you can be fired and end up looking for another to join anyway...+Multiple ways of trying to win each season.  You can ""save up"" and go the money route.  In this way, you can literally build up your car well enough that you could win races with the worst drivers.  Another way is to find the good drivers and fight your way to the top.  And another is to grab a high priced and great driver to win the races for you.  I call this the three tier system.  Lowest tier ""saving up"" is there to ensure that a person can eventually progress their teams (time consuming, somewhat boring, but effective).  The middle tier ""fight it out"" is the most exciting.  Takes the longest to progress, but your races can be more exciting as juggling between drivers and car enhancements makes the difference.  The top tier ""great driver"".  You can sneak a few rookie drivers that ""should have been"" in the more advanced divisions in a lower division and sign them on your team.  Easy wins that gain you money through fulfilling your sponsorship deals (although this is only marginal and the most boring of the three as you always see your driver advance through 19 other drivers and take wins with huge leads and no other driver to challenge).+can literally play the game with just a mouse.  This is the only way I play the game.  Never need two hands...lolCon's...-There is no great crash scenes.  Cars simply drive off the track and stop.  There is no visual damage to cars.  Every once in a while, a car starts to smoke, but that is about it.-AI cars tend to crash waaaay less than your drivers even though your driver is statistically suppose to crash way less than them.  Ratio seems to be about 6-1.-no special scenes.  don't expect any.  for example, you won't see a tow truck tow your car back to the pits during caution.-car to car collisions do happen, but not often...and of course, you won't see any damage although you got damage...it will tell you that you got damaged, but you won't see it on the car....-your cars can crash during caution.  thought it was funny the first time...-pit stops don't seem accurate with percentages of a good/great/bad pit stop times.  if it says 31% of a mishap, it seems to be 60+%.  Doesn't really seem to harm you a great deal, but might cost you a few places in a race....-there is no multiple car crashes.  in other words, you won't see your car losing control and hitting another car or cars.  Usually if you hit another car, you won't see it.  All that happens is that you and the other car will suffer wing damage that can be repaired in the pits.  You also will never hit more than one car.  So, either you wipe out off the track (ie: drive and stop off the track) and are out for the race.  or you are notified that one of your parts (wings) are damaged and need to pit.  Sometimes you are penalized for it and must make another trip through pit lane.  Sometimes your are not...Overall, the game is a simulator that is based off of your decisions.  Random events do happen, but are not devastating regardless of your decisions.  You can benefit some, or lose some.  This game is worth the price tag they gave it.Normal price = good deal.25% off = great deal.50% off = definitely worth investing = awesome deal!			",21,18,1,11,3,2,15

												WHY IS THIS GAME SO MUCH FUN?!?! I honestly don't know! I don't know anything about real car racing. The fastest car I've driven is a Volvo station wagon. I once used ""carburator"" as a verb. My dream car is a Lifetime Bus Pass. But daayyyyuuummmmmm if this game didn't keep me up until 04:00. I have actually cheered aloud at my screen when a driver made a nice overtaking move. I have a spreadsheet to calculate tire wear rates. My wife thinks I'm crazy. I think she took my bus pass. Buy this game right now because it is of outstanding quality and more people should take note of it.			",81,14,1,13,15,0,14

												Motorsport Manager is a must have for every open-wheel race fan that is looking for a game where you take the reins of your own raceing team.Car- and part development, hiring and firing of drivers/staff, building up the facilities, getting sponsors and live out your fantasy of being Christian Horner or Maurizio Arrivabene on the pit-wall.So far the experience is very good and a decent Formula 1-ish (the game hasn't got the official license) manager game was long overdue. If you're looking for such a game, then look no further because you've found it.A personal story of me being the lowest tier and low ranked team manager trying to get my team to score those valuable championship points. During the race one of my drivers that was driving in a very respectable 6th place suffered from a couple of faulty parts that where in danger of breaking down. Because I didn't wanted to concede my 6th place I decided to roll the dice and keep him out on the track instead of pitting; which was a mistake. 1 laps until the checkered flag the engine coughed out a plume of smoke and the car came down to a crawl. 16th place it was and my driver was not best pleased which he let me know on the radio.

												I have been waiting for this game for a while! As an avid Formula 1 fan I enjoy all aspects of the Formula.  I play iRacing and I have been itching for a management game.  These guys were responsible for the iOS app Motorsport manager and I still play it daily, though I found it wasn't nearly indepth enough.  Not enough choices, though still an amazing game.This game is everything I could ask for.  You start the game as a beginner ""Team Principal"" and jump into the team management right away. Everything from race calls, car setup, part design and improvement, factory improvement, driver relationships to each other and their mechanics.  Its awesome.  Pros- Very indepth.- Talk to drivers to hone in on the perfect race setup and collect feedback- Design parts and ♥♥♥♥ off the number 2 driver because you didn't give him that new front wing.- Pony up to your team owner, or jump teams if you worry your job is in jeapordy- Decide how long you want race sessions to be and control every aspect of your cars.- So many more awesome thingsCons- I would have enjoyed a very zoomed out map of the whole track, as camera can only rotate around selected car. Still fine.- Tutorial is a bit annoying.  (But you can cancel it so thats a plus)Overall -  I love it, exactly what I was looking for!			",189,23,8,21,30,0,34

												Danish version here, english under.Nu hvor jeg har fået spillet spillet nolge timer, så vil jeg sige spillet er meget sjovt :) Gameplayet er nemt at lære og sjovt på samme tid, en seson kan tag nogle timer, men det er nok også en af de ting der gør spillet sjovt.Vil ønske der var lidt mere ind bare F1 biler men det er sku stadig sjovt.Med steam workshop der også snart skulle komme, så bliver det her spil meget sjover.Det her spil er ikke for alle, så gå ind på youtube vis du har brug for at se nåde om det, og vis du godt kunne lide mobil versionen, så vil du også 100p elske det her spil.Træningen var lidt træls for mig, men var glad for at jeg kunne slå den fra.Prisen er så lidt høj synes jeg, men stadig et fedt spil.Med de ting spillet har at offer så vil jeg sige det er et af de beste Manager spil på market lige nu.Vil klaret anbefal det :) for mig er det et 9.3/10. :)English version: Now that I have been playing the game for some hours, I would say the game is very fun :) Gameplay is easy to learn and fun at the same time, one seson can take several hours, but it is probably one of the things that makes the game fun.i Do wish there was a little more then just F1 cars but it's still fun.With steam workshop also soon to come, the game whould be more awesome.This game is not for everyone, if you want to lern more then go to youtube, to also to se if it's for you, and if you liked the mobile version, so you will also love this game.The training was a little anorying for me, but was glad that I could turn it off.The price is a little high but all in all, still fun.With the things the game has to offer. I would say it is one of the beste Manager games on the market right now.Will 100% recommend it :) for me it's a 9.3 / 10. :)			",133,14,8,8,29,1,18

You need to be on ur toes too for the entire race. Will definitely be a promoter of this game for years to come...Would like to see- Q1,Q2,Q3 qualifiers in the world series; - Compatibility with external MODS; (now you have to wait for the MODS geek to release new versions for each MM update- More competitiveness (after few races, you can dominate very easily)- Option to remove parts that u designed (so that it does not pile up the screen)- Ability to view other Team principal stats- Ability to search players for scouting- Start a new career with chassis design rather than race			",2,0,1,0,3,0,0

It has the correct amount of detail without getting stupidly complicated. Balancing the budget to build a new car adds spice for the start of each season. Bringing back memories of playing GP Manager 2 back in the mid 90's as an 8 year old.I though the game was a little easy as half way through the first season I had reliable and fast cars (picked a fast team tho), won the championship and got promoted. By race 4 in season 2, I was sacked.  Hopefully there are more up and downs like that. Overall, this game is adddictive and fun.  ",10,0,3,0,9,0,4

												An utterly fantastic game. If you liked the Motorsport Manager on the mobile app, you owe it to yourself to buy this game!Manage an entire race team, from the ground up. Hire and fire drivers, engineers. Manage your money, and build upgrades to buildings giving your team access to better equipment, parts, drivers, engineers, etc.Create car parts, and improve their reliability. Read emails and do interviews, increasing synergy between your teammates or increasing your marketability between sponsors. Keep the same drivers to create a bond between their mechanics giving them better abilities. Your drivers pick up traits, good and bad. Scout new drivers, at any time to see what they are rated, or just go out and find someone you want and offer them a deal. Choose between short, medium or long races, and change at any time. Do practice runs to increase your gear ratios, tire pressure, suspension, and more based on feedback from your drivers and mechanics to perfect your car for race day.There's so much more to this game than I can describe. Buy it, play it, love it!			",182,30,3,66,35,1,41

												Another example of wishing there was a ""meh"" review.I enjoy the game, and I don't regret buying it at all. But I don't feel I could readily recommend it to anyone without a carload of caveats.In short, you will like this game if 1) you're a casual Football Manager player that doesn't go for 20-season-long dynasties, and 2) you like motor sports a bit, but not enough to be annoyed at how comparatively shallow this is.There's just not as much to dig into here as I'd want. Everything seems a little too surface-level, there's so very little nuance for the most part. As a car guy I really want to dig into it. What's the compression look like, how's the airflow to the engine, what's the fuel mixture here. Maybe work on specific engine components, not necessarily down to a micro level, but at least something to give it variance. Instead you've got GOOD engine and AVERAGE engine, and some have bonuses to things like top speed. Ok... can I get something more please? The overall team management is the same. you can hire three drivers, two mechanics, and a designer. All of that works vaguely like Football Manager, but there's far less nuance to building a team. Or to hiring sponsors, or to building out your facility beyond ""do you have enough money"". Managing the whole affair really isn't difficult once you've got a few basic HQ improvements in hand. And it struck me shortly ago that if they tuned down the graphics and tweaked the UX, this would very easily be an iPhone game. Actually, is it? Might already be. I should check. But it carries that kind of feel to it. So, no, can't recommend. Definitely wouldn't recommend at this price point for sure.			",173,45,5,23,89,4,43

												Very good game, though could be a lot better.  Once you have setups for your cars for certain tracks, it would be very nice to just be able to ""Load"" these presets.  I shouldn't have to play with a notebook beside me to track settings.  Would also be nice to be able to early-end practice sessions and to end both practice and races early if someone's run out of gas / going so slow that it takes 2+ minutes to end the final lap.  Money management is very tight; you can't really have a decent 3rd driver because you'll just have negative cashflow.  I've stopped playing the game because these things are just so tedious but it's fun for a while.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you love racing, or if you like the idea of football manager but hate football, this is a must!I love the idea of management games, and have played several, but I have no interest in sports such as football. This game captures the magic of a good management game, but is so much more if you are a motorsport fan. I wish I was not skeptical about it, but I'm glad I bought it, because I'd be missing out on a phenomenally good game. 20 hours in a weekend where I actually had a lot of other stuff going on is testament to how addictive this game is- and not addictive in a mobile/F2P sense, but addictive because it's a damn, damn good game.

												Eagerly waited for this but it's really repetitive, I think on the scale between depth and accessibility it's way to near the accessible side - which is interesting as F1 (let's face it it's F1) is an incredibly technical, nuanced sport with thousands upon thousands of variables.The game does an admiralable job, looks and sounds fantastic but the depth just isn't here - no reason to keep playing.Leaving a negative review but I don't think it's a bad game - just a lot of wasted potential - buy it if it's on sale.

												I don't normally review games, but for this one I'll make an exception.Having played Grand Prix Manager 2 to death back in the mid-90s, I've been eager to play a modern ""F1"" manager game. The last one of note was the imaginatively titled ""F1 Manager"" back in 2000 or so and it wasn't brilliant.Motorsport Manager, however, is. It's in-depth enough to keep F1 die-hards interested but without it getting bogged down in the details. You have to manage driver and team relationships, the mechanics and drivers bond the longer they work together and you have to get the results to keep your team owner and sponsors happy.The presentation is fantastic, if you've ever played Football Manager then the UI shouldn't take getting too much used to. The race coverage looks beautiful; the tracks are sublimely detailed with an abundance of cranes, tents, crowds and other assorted things you tend to find at a real track.The races do lack a little excitement (so far); it would be nice to speed it up beyond 3x (though I understand the limit here, any faster and your liable to miss a pit call or damage to the cars etc). The other area that is a little lacking is the car setup - it's pretty simplistic. Again though, I can understand this as it helps keep the game accessible to those with less enthusiatic knowledge.If you're a fan of the old games like GPM2 or are a motorsport fan who has played Football Manager then I can't recommend this game enough.

												I was looking forward to this game for a while ever since Aarava played the mobile and preview versions, and while the game is no different than what was showcased in the previews and trailers I guess I was expecting a little more for the full release. The game is easy to pick up and play. Just play a season with Predator and you will learn the dos and dont dos that can apply to pretty much all the other teams. The most glaring flaw I see is the lack of documentation on what does exactly what. For example, setup. Does it make any difference to get more acceleration by shortening the gears or by changing the aero? or during race, the strategy, if I push does it affect just the tyre wear or does it also impact the brakes? if I go rich mix, does it JUST impact the engine? or does it impact the gearbox as well? It is hard to tell. How much do tyre temperatures affect performance? Should I sacrifice tyre wear to raise my temperature? is it worth it? A manual would have been exceptionally useful to make a few things clear. I know that eventually a Wiki is going to come up, but that is not really an excuse for not including a manual. Now, about bugs, it is normal for a game that just was released, I am not going to fry Playsport over it, however I can notice that the game is not optimized for Crossfire or SLI setups, shadows do shimmer on ocassion, although I havent noticed micro stuttering, so that's good. Now for things that I wasnt completely sold on. Even on long race settings, qualification and practice is exceptionally short, motorsport is about extreme precision and calculation, mostly an OCD heaven for those inclined and having such a short time for perfecting your setup is not that great, specially when nobody would lose anything by lenghtening it, players that dont want to subject themselves to it could skip it, or just speed up time. Also, having a lap counter on each driver would be very useful, since the lap counter is based on the driver in pole position, so you have to pause and calculate how much of the lap your drivers have done and see if you have enough fuel, or just go on lean mix until ""excess fuel"" comes up if you cant be bothered, which can cost you some pace. Now for things I would like to see in the future, maybe in DLC is the opportunity to create your own team (or just completely revamp an existing team) and host multiplayer seasons (Where the host can choose not to participate but can do things like choose the weather during the sessions to spice things up). So far that is what I think of the game, it is not bad and I will be playing it for a while more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hated it for a while but then........I started with the worst possible team, right at the bottom and was hating how bad my results were all the time but then, you get that one race. Wet qualifying but it looks like the weather might clear at the end so you gamble, you keep them in the pits until the last possible second and go for it on slicks with a still slightly damp track and boom! P1 for the Marussia style team.That's when it became fun.

												Hello there!I have wanted a Formula One flavoured management game for a long, long time. Does this game deliver for racing fans like me?Yes, it does, but not completely.The actual race element of the game is excellent, with the very real ability to implement strategies to make the most of your cars & drivers.The weather changes, parts fail, the safety car is deployed, drivers get penalties, drivers flat-spot their tyres, drivers take out their teammates...all good stuff.The graphics and sound are basic, this being an upgraded mobile port I wasn't expecting it to look or sound like Codemasters' F12016 in action, but they are perfectly acceptable and do not detract from the experience. You won't be needing much hardware muscle to enjoy the race.The only bit that feels missing is the actual man-management aspect. The drivers, your staff and the media repeat the same handful of lines over and over every single race. The mock Twitter feed is particularly painful, being literal repetition every single time it appears on your screen. And when I say the text is limited, I mean it is VERY limited.The interactions with drivers and staff are non-existent. You do NOT manage them at all. Not one bit. At no point do you get a sense that you are dealing with a person with thoughts and opinions, it is just the same few YES/NO interactions over and over, with no nuance or depth. The way Football Manager manages to instill personality into the AI is infinitely superior, but maybe future releases will address this.It needs a few more dollops of serious in the recipe for the next one. Not enough to make it impenetrable and offputting, but just more meat on the bones of the interactions with supposed people. Take a bit of the comedy out of the text, put a few more bits of tension in.As a game about managing two cars through a race it's good, the pit-wall experience is there and very satisfying when you feel your strategies are controlling the race. It's also enough to make you swear at the cat when some Maldonado shunts the car you've just bolted all the expensive new parts onto at the first corner! Winning feels great, too.Buy it to try and win races with fuel and tyre strategies, and you'll be very happy with your purchase.But the man-management side is completely missing, in my opinion, and I wouldn't buy it for that.

												I've been following the development of MM on PC for a while, having played the mobile version of this game before. The game is a significant upgrade to the mobile version. It is not a ""port"". Several features have been added, and existing ones overhauled. Highly recommend this game, easily worth the cost. Had no issues running the game, worked right out of the box.

												Nice looking game that does what it does well enough, however the gameplay is very shallow and repetitive, kept me interested for a few hours, then everything began to feel very stale.I can't recommend it at full price, it feels too much like an iphone app right now, it needs a couple of years to mature, lots of additional features, much more depth and complexity and better AI, plus a slew of mods before I'll be revisiting the game again.Lots of potential, but needs fleshing out.

												I'm not a motorsport guy (I don't even watch F1 on TV) but really enjoyed this game. It's a bit casual compared to the other ""manager"" games on the market but this is an upside for people like me. Its deepness (and also style) is like Fifa Manager, so if you are looking for something like Football Manager, you can be disappointed.If you like management games, I can recommend this game. And if you like motorsports, most probably you'll enjoy more.PS. You can find some amazing mods on internet. Currently some of them are not in the workshop, so you need a Google search.

												I just started playing this with no prior knowledge of the mobile app or F1 Manager from the 90's that people are talking about.  From a newcomer's (to the genre) perspective, this is a challenging yet highly rewarding game to play.  The amount of detail is just about right without getting too technical.  I think if the developer made Normal and Advanced modes, they could make it appleal to everyone.  As of right now, it's got just enough detail to get inexperienced players (like me) to dive into a strategy/puzzle game such as this.  Yes, this is a puzzle game in a broad sense of the word.  Trying to make everything you want to do to the car fit into the timeframe before the race is a part of that puzzle.  When I started playing (after going through the nicely informative tutorial), I immediately chose the hardest team, Predator Racing.  The first thing I did was piece together my plans for improving performance and reliability using the calendar and trying to fit everything in so I could end the year at a decent position in the standings.  As a manager, your job is not just to look at the immediate situation, but look many races ahead and plan your strategy to win those.  I love this type of planning game (like Civ).This game is one of my new favorites.EDIT: It has now been one month since I started playing this game and I'm still finding it highly addictive.  I haven't played any of my other games because of the challenge this one posesses.  I have been keeping myself away from the Steam discussions on how to quickly beat this game with Predator Racing Team.  It's currently 2022 and I'm slowly working my way up the ranks in ERS.  I focused on my staff, then HQ, then drivers, and now I'm working on improving the car.  I know I should have concentrated on my car first, but that's all a part of how I play.  I look for the ""long, slow win"".A couple of things:1. You should either use Excel or buy a notebook to record car setups.  I prefer a notebook.2. The car setups are not going to be the same every year, but they will be close.  Driver's change, cars change, parts change, weather changes...all this goes into why the setups are never the same.  I did not read any of the ""100% setup"" guides specifically because of this fact.			",17,1,1,0,6,1,9

												EDIT:01/01/2016Still a very positive game, but lately my computer has been crashing alot.. the last week ive played over 22hrs or so and the game has started crashing and more frequently. Never has in the past so im assuming they have done a patch that i havnt noticed and its crashing. I have also noticed that they fixed the blue flag problem with the backmarkers so now i can go into qualiflying without being holding me up. GREAT advantage, however, not the real deal! why apply a fix that allows cars to driver through one another? why not spend more time fixing the engine on the backmarkers getting out of the way?If the game had a racing line, then you would be able to easily fix the issue..simply when doing a hot lap, your on the racing line. when cooling down or heading to the pits, your off the racing line!?!?! SIMPLES!!over 100 hours now just like i said previously, and i still find the game rewarding and full of fun!however, i dont like seeing 3 laps to go with the safety car out and all drivers have pitted with the correct amount of fuel and new tyres, but being in first place and getting totally blown away by Stein motorsport by more then 20 secs is NOT REALISTIC!!thats the biggest con of this game, the game is far from being realistic!Another thing id like them to apply, is spending REAL money on the game to benefit your gaming experience! Just like you could in the phone app version!They have got alot to fix, but this doesnt change my view of the game. I still love it and even talk to my self every now and then as if im being interviewed on the game! lol...little personal fun but hey, its great!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Even though i have only clocked up 4 hours so far on this game, Motorsport Manager definately lived up to its expectations! Ive played the Mobile version of this and have clocked up atleast 100hrs of none stop fun on it but this design in racing is literally all ive ever wanted to play!Motorsport Manager is a PURE management game! Can be played as a casual game but also take it seriously.On the good points, the game is totally decision based on how you like your racers to race! YOU ARE IN COMPLETE CONTROL! and on a plus side, the races arnt a 5min race like what the Mobile version is like!The graphics for a game like this is amazing, considering its all been transferred and redesgined from a mobile game app! Its definately worth buying, but i highly and strongly recommand you download the Mobile version of it first ( i think its free) before you play as for some people, it could get boring and get boring really fast!This game is not the for racing type gamers, its 100% management! to put it all in a nutshell, imagine you are Toto Wolff or Christian Horner. This game is literally like being one of them! and for those who dont know the names of the people i just said, then you might not wana buy this game.. Even though it does say MOTORSPORT, its really not, its F1, GP2 and GP3 but its not an official game from F1 ( FIA). Due to copyrights, i assume they decided to create their own style of brands etc as im sure it makes the game cheaper..so no, you wont see no Lewis Hamiton, Nico Rosbery or Daniel Riccairdo! But honestly, does this really matter?Being a true F1 supporter and fanatic, i loved this game even before it came out! i can see myself clocking easily over 100hours gametime even 1000 if i really wanted too!A true gamer with no history of playing the mobile game would rate this a 6 for graphics, 8 for gameplay and 7 for everything else. BUT!!! due to me knowing how much effort they have done to this game, how little the brand is and how they turned a Mobile game into a PC game, id rate all aspects of this game a 10/10!!You most definately need to be keen on management type games as this one is by far the most balanced management type game out there!!

												I was really sceptical, because as a F1 fan, I was wondering if I could be interested in a fantasy racing management game for long. But I have to say, the game keeps me motivated so far. I think the management part is very in-depth and the races demand strategic thinking to be successful. And even features like promotion / relagation of teams between leagues, which didn't seem to make sense to me at first, work for me. It's kind of Football Manager with Racing Teams, and a simulation model of a full in-depth racing manager.There are several glitches in the races, like drivers sometimes make braking mistakes every lap causing the tires to not last longer than 2-3 laps, so every car will pit like 10-12 times a race. But those are rare, and the game has only just been released and those errors will hopefully be patched soon. 90% of all races work without any relevant glitches and I didn't notice any bugs in the management part so far at all.I can recommend this to every fan of sports management games like Football Manager, OOTP or similar. Hardcore F1-Fans should probably wait until there are F1 mods.			",13,3,3,4,25,1,5

												My first review, as Motorsport Manager ticked off so many boxes that it encouraged me to sing its praises.  I am an 'elder computer gamer' of over 30 years since the early 'RGB' days, and as such, have played hundreds of computer games.  Foremost, Motorsport Manager has adopted numerous game mechanics from some of the better products without a hint of plagarism.  There are short and long-term decisions required; strategic as well as tactical decisions; real-time elements and thoughtful 'over a beer' decision-making without the pressure of a clock.  There are building game elements, racing game elements, team management elements, financial decisions, car livery colors, voting on rule sets, on and on.  Regardless of your interest-- or lack thereof-- in Formula 1 Racing, this is an exceptional management game ranked near the top of my list in this computer-game category.If you have been thrilled by such products as X-com, Cities Skyline, Bloodbowl, Dungeon Keeper, Front Page Sports Football, MLB 'The Show,' Railroad Tycoon or Rollercoaster Tycoon, then Motorsport Manager will scratch the itch.  While it has a few flaws, many of which I suspect will be patched, it is definately worthy of a purchase and support for this smaller developer.  Within just the last 6 weeks they have provided free liveries for the cars-- I can't wait to see how they continue to develop this outstanding product.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you love motor racing or sports management games in general then this is a definite purchase! I enjoy strategy and management games and have been wanting something for motor racing for a damn long time. This game is everything you want from a racing management game and so much more. It's in an entirely different league to any other racing management game out there. And for the price, it's a steal!From the 3D world and races to the part designing and interacting with the Global Motorsport Authority and rival teams to determine the next set of rules, the game covers every aspect of open wheel racing in amazing depth. There's a large selection of tracks and teams across 3 different categories to choose from and with Steam Workshop and modding support coming in the future, this game still has amazing potential to become even better.

												You can see the influence of the old F1 manager games as well as modern Football Manager in Motorsport Manager; it's a reasonably deep management sim that in my opinion strikes a really good balance between interesting racing but also fun gameplay to go with it.The lack of licensing is also dealt with really well, the championship structure is similar enough to Formula 1 that you know what it's like, without the lack of branding ever being immersion-breaking.I also like the fact they are releasing free DLC alonside the paid stuff, and that there has (so far) been good post-release support.

												This is a superb game and incredibly addictive.  It's not overly complex to pick up and play but takes plenty of hard work and careful planning and refining to perfect.I am hopeful the longevity of the game will be greatly enhanced with further updates and community involvement and can't wait for further updates.One thing I would like to see, either by option (like Football Manager) or by design is to throw the challenge curveball.  I'd like to see randomised abilities of staff and drivers for every new game so we don't get to the stage that once strategies are refined, there is a roadmap to guaranteed success by hiring Driver A & B and Staff C, D and E for 2 seasons then etc etc etc.If you have any vague interest in Motorsport or Mangement games then this come highly recommended and certainy be prepared to have several late nights as it hooks you in!Would love to see an online version pitting real players against each other.... ahhhhhh			",16,2,2,2,9,1,3

												My experience after 15 hours:Bought the gamePlayed an hourRefunded the gameRead some articles, comments, reviews and watched some youtube videos on the game againBought the game againUnderstood the gamePlayed 13 hours straightHonestly I think this game is incredible especially for someone with 0 intrest in F1, after a couple races and maybe a career restart you finally understand how the practice, pitstops and the whole fuel and tire tread system works.Also in some games you can play the ♥♥♥♥ team and still win because there is a difficulty setting and you can usually beat the AI. In this game honestly goodluck getting passed maybe 9th with the bottom team in tier 3 (out of 10).Honest rating 8/10 would love if you could skip time easier instead of simming through the days and also if the tips your driver gave you were on a sort of document so you could edit the feel of the car for the driver during the practice run. Because i sometimes forget if they want more acceleration or top speed etc.			",95,15,4,13,41,1,6

The list go's on and, on i really like that. What's even better is the tutorial that will help someone like myself with no knowledge of how to Manage the Company. I give them an A+ for that. With a game with this much depth in it you need that. So i would say that this game is good for both Experienced and, Non-experienced Motorsport Managers. I can't really find anything i don't like about this game. but there is two things i would like to see added. Like a view from inside the cars when we race and, the ability to create your own Logo for your Company. Bottom line is if you buy this game don't be surprised if all you wanna do is Play Motorsport Manager and, nothing else it's that much fun to play.			",7,1,1,1,10,2,4

												Superbly done motorsport managing game, but not without drawbacks...Pros.Addictive gamplay - always a problem to solve, or something to make better.Great politics system - much more in-depth that I intially thought.Superb upgrading/design system - really makes you think about what is best for your team and drivers, instead of just maxing out everything.Races themselves are well done - active weather, occasional crashes, team disputes.Mod support!Cons.Soundtrack - all cars sound the same (and not in a good way), and a single track playing in the background between races gets annoying FAST.Race strategies are far too easy to optimise - very little benefit of the undercut, for example.Can be quite easy to dominate constantly.No difficulty levels - just one.No point of the 3D race viewing - everything still stays very far away, so there's no much point.Overall, brilliant game, great potential, can't wait to see where it goes next! 8/10 ",53,3,28,2,5,0,2

I also have an owners vote coming up next week to allow development on the rear wing next year rather than using spec parts - as a low ranked team I can't afford to design another set of parts so i'll be voting ""No"".Ok so Germany is next, need good brakes and good suspension - got the guys in the factory improving the performence on those parts, wow it will be ready 1 day before the race - lucky me!New email - My young driver has been mouthing off to my engineers?

I played the mobile version of this game on Android before this came out and was already blown away but this PC release is just perfect.So many details go into creating a team, managing drivers/car development/finances but it's not rocket science.It's a unique game with rules changing every season and much more pretty unexpected stuff (like drivers getting injured or other things) but great features. It also has nice graphics for a simulator and the tracks are just beautiful. If you really like motorsport you should get this because it's really worth it and fun!I can only recommend this. Once you start you can't stop.Pros:- Devs listen to the support of the community + Workshop support on the way (hurrah mods)- Nice UI with awesome tooltips and explaination what everything does- Nice random events be it in a race or while managing the team- Safety cars / Virtual safety cars- Changeable weather conditions- Changeable rules for each season i.e. longer race distance / addition of new tracks to the calendar / SC or VSC rules or both and much more- Nice management of drivers/engineers/designers and spotting for new staff- changeable car liveries and a massive amount of car developmentThis list could go on forever ...Really the only Con I can find at the moment is the lack of a FIA licence but hey mods can maybe fix some of that :) ",195,14,39,17,25,3,17

												I have been a motorsport fan since i was old enough to appreciate the sound of a screaming engine. I watched BSB, MotoGP, F1 and BTCC and being a technically minded child who always asked why, i loved the tech and setup side of motorsport as much as the racing and the skill involved.I played racing games since day dot, from the notoriously difficult TOCA series through the GranTourismo and F1 franchise. I have dabbled in manager games before but none quite tickled my fancy, until now.This game is fantastic, for anyone who is a fan of motorsport and has an understanding of how teams, cars and drivers work. This game is a must. No game is perfect and this one has had its teething problems, which are being worked through (none of them are really game breakers) The community support, tips and guides is amazing, which shows the spirit of motorsport fans and soon we will have the workshop section of the game active.I have currently clocked 172 hours on the game (some may have been afk whilst eating etc) completed 9 seasons working with team China. Working from Euro, through Asia ensuring i upped my staff and HQ i have reached my first season in the World Championship, second worst car on the grid, but through using light, fast strategy with 3 stops i have won 2 races =)----------------------------------------------------------If you like F1/Motorsport and also have played manager type games in the past, this game is a must			",32,1,4,1,4,0,3

												I want to like this game, I really do, but they don't make it easy.It starts off great with a solid introduction to the game.  It has you calling tactics on your drivers for the first race and introduces you to all the controls dealing with race days.  After the first race it introduces you to the plethora of in game features to deal with both off track and on the track concerns.  You can easily see that there is a lot of well thought out detail to the game and plenty that will have a drastic impact on race performance.  Herin lies the problem howeverYou start doing like anyone would do, sink a tonne of money into parts for your car to bring its performance up.  Heck you can even see if you are on par with the car average and what areas your car is weak in.  By the end of the season, you've done a pretty bang up job of creating an on par or even better than average car.   Even with that tutorial race (which turns out to be a disaster for your standings) you have managed to finish up strong in the standings at the end of the year.Now it's time to design next years car.  If you are anything like me, you saved a lot of money for this and have a sizeable chunk of change to sink into it, and you do.  You assume that this will bring your car stat up and you will be a strong competitor next year.  Well, you assumed wrong!  All this does is improve the chasis stat's, which can help tire wear, fuel burn etc.  None of these do anything to boost your cars actual rating.  In fact, by re-designing your car, all that money you spent on new parts last year?  Gone.  It resets all your parts back down to factory stats and that car you just sunk 32 million into is now at the bottom of the car averages.You have a big hill to climb, so you get at it, sinking huge money into parts this season.  You are climbing, but you are still very far behind, and you finish the season with decent middle of the pack standings and your car is still far below average.  Then you realize that this is a never ending cycle of pain.  This never stops, each season you MUST re-design your car at the end of the year and it resets everything back to garbage.  Your competition?  Nope, their cars retain their stats.  In fact each season THEY GO UP while you start with scraps and garbage duct taped together hap hazardly which rears its ugly head for the first few races.  Parts explode mid race like crazy, your driver who was doing good is forced to make incredibly long pit stops and drops to 20th position while you scramble to improve part reliability.  Then you get to watch the screen helplessly as your drivers are overtaken over and over and over, not because they lack skill, but because your car just plain sucks and you CANNOT get it better fast enough.I just can't handle this rinse and repeat process.  Each season becomes the exact same as the first, a struggle to get the car a somewhat crappy form of decent that's worse than everyone elses cars.  Nothing changes, a routine forms and the game get's boring in a hurry.  After 4 seasons I'm done, and the third season was a massive struggle.  Maybe the game is more fun on a high performance team where your expectation is to come in 1st in the standings, but at least your car dosn't suck.Sorry everyone, unless this is on a big sale, it's only going to interest you for 10-15 hours before you get sick of it.

												This is the game if you want to experience formula 1 without playing Codemasters formula 1 games or that's the case for me at least. I have also tried some other racing management games, but this is the best one yet.Pros:+ Very well made and has only a few bugs that I have found+ Doesn't require a powerful computer+ (new) Workshop supportNeutral:-/+ Follows the same plot as other simulation games-/+ Can be repetitive-/+ Graphics don't matter in this game, but they aren't that greatCons:- Too simple on some aspects-  High price-  Game says that these super soft tyres last 10-12 laps, but actually you can do 8. My drivers have never done more or equal amount of laps as the game tells me my drivers can do. (Expect with a perk, when tyres last longer.)			",261,70,18,15,66,3,31

												Having spent hours on the mobile version, seeing the incredible improvements they have made for PC really brings the game to life and offers motorsport fans the managerial style game most have been after for years.The ability to work your way through from the the lower championships to the top tier is brilliant, giving you a sense of connection with your team - avoiding being relegated by my driver making a pass into the final points position on the last lap of the last race of the season gave a sense of joy I can only imagine real team bosses feel, they've hit the nail on the head with this.This in mind, it still has a number of bugs that over time will need fixing, such as lapped cars racing you and screwing your chances of gaining positions, similarly finding your car blocked by one and losing handfuls of positions because your driver doesnt move around, and intermediates/wets offering same lap times as dry tyres. All of these I hope they will fix in the future.Would recommend this game to anyone into motorsport or who loves this style of gameplay			",28,4,12,4,8,0,6

												MM is absolutely gorgeous in its design and art style, the dynamic 3D environments are just exceptionally beautiful.I've never had any interest in manager style games and of course, F1 is cool.. but I'd never thought I'll give such a game a shot. It surprised me at how detailed and realistic it was, with great replayability for sure. It doesn't bore you with the sort of details that only hard core fans would find interesting, but has a nice learning curve for someone who simply enjoys racing culture and also good enough to entertain those who always wanted a ""business management"" outlet for the sport.Price is reasonable and the team behind MM are extremely responsive to the players and fans. Don't listen to reviews that whine about price or how its ""not detailed"" enough.Honestly, some people have the habit of picking on every little thing regardless, so whatever. They think just because they paid a small sum, they are owed it. Lol. They expect everything They Like and Want in the game, if not it's not good enough. So don't bother with those sort of reviews cos they are the excessively opinionated and entitled minority.Definitely give it a shot if you're even remotely curious or interested in any of its aspects, it it Very worth the time!

												Coming from the mobile version of Motorsport Manager, I was absolutely hyped. The amount of features shown in the trailers was pretty stunning to say the least. If you played Motorsport Manager on your phone, you should enjoy this.Apart from all the racing, team managing and so on, there are a few really subtle things I like about the game. When the weather goes from sunny to clouded over, the brightness of the track, ground and everything will decrease slightly. Also, as I sit here, typing this at 3am, the game's exit button is taunting me, subtitled with ""go back to the real world.""At this moment, I almost don't want to.			",83,7,11,0,14,1,4

												Good and BadSo I start out with a team that is a little inexperienced and underfunded.  OK, I like the challenge.  I figure out we will not win early but get a good long term stratigy. I run the cars in weaker settings during the race to conserve them.  I just barely stay on the lead lap even at times, but open them up and gamble like mad on the last lap or two.  This works untill we can afford better parts and research facilities.  We place consistantly in the top 4-10 spots, but no podiums this way.  The team has a great first season by defying expectations, everyone is happpy, every part is created and maxed out, and the prize money and sponsor pay is mega big.Off-season comes.  We expand the HQ and get more abilities to upgrade car parts for next season.  We buy the most expensive everything while developing next years chasis.   We turn down no research funding what-so-ever and say yes, spend for speed and durability at every corner imaginable.Second season.  What in Sam Hill happened to all that money we spent.  The car is utter rubbish.  No joke, it runs worse than the first season car in every category.  Best durability on a non-wing feature is like 43.  We maxed all of it out and upgraded all of it last season.  We spent millions in the off season for what?  This is garbage.You can't compete at all.  You have to pit every 1/3 of the race to even keep the car running replacing 2 to 3 major components each stop even when only running on the lowest settings trying to conserve your car.  Apparently teams with worse HQ, Staff, and all did not have that off-season drop you experienced because some how your car is rated 9th out of ten teams and they somehow have the money to out develope you at every turn this season and run full out without blowing up, but if you run even two laps at medium your car will be a ball of flames.  Come on?There is zero point of a franchise mode or building for the future if you have to start over every year with such a massive handycap and utter garbage system.  Having multimillion dollar facilities and paying tens of millions of dollars in the off season will get you parts your local Ford dealer would not even put in a Ford Escort let alone a Mustang and a stock Mustang would out perform your multi-million dollar open wheel peace of trash at this point.  I give the game a 5 out of 10.  The graffics are fine, the concept is good, but the Franchize Mode needs to be a little more on the level when handycapping your team at the start of each season.  Winning in the first four weeks would be an utter myth any season if this is the pattern.  3 races in and spending on upgrading and making new parts; it will be race 6 or seven before I have durrability to a run a full race level assuming there are no bumps and such with other cars and drivers.  Not looking forward to playing multiple seasons of this game if this is it.   They make FootBall Manager and I could not imagine if I lost my stadium and over 3/4 of my roster every off season as well.  That is what they are doing here and more.			",6,0,4,1,12,0,4

												Well...- Economic simulation is ok- R&D seems pretty good, hiring, pilots specs, scouting, let's say it's ok too- Graphic & interfaces fine- Linux support perfect.But at this stage, during grand prix, the games is broken by 3 things :- my pilots are totally inconsistent (1 good lap, 2 bad, and when i said 2 bad, its +3 sec, why??)- blue flags stuff is totally broken : you lost 10 sec each blue flag (ehy guys, you dont have a stop line), and when you are faster than a guy which have 1 turn advance, this loop appears: ""you overtake => blue flag => 10 sec lost => you overtake => blue flag => 10 sec lost"".- i dont undertand why, but computer cars gain 3 or 4 secondes a lap at the end of the race, and my pilots don't, even with brand new tires, F1 in good condition and pushing hard. So i stay 10-15 position during race and finish last & last due to this ending slowdown & broken blue flag system.Well, pretty disapointing, i cannot recommend this in this state.			",5,0,7,3,3,1,11

												At the moment of this review I have 70 hours played in 2 weeks, and I am just finishing my 5th season.All i can say is that I am truly impressed with the balance this game shows. I played every single FM since 05, and after couple seasons it's easy to stay at the top. Not in MM.The rules changes over seasons, and there's a constant need of evolution to be competitive - what makes this game interesting and unique at every new season. It took me 4 seasons to be champion with Van Dort (Force India equal), of both drivers and team championship, and 5th season was a disaster, even with excellent drivers and an expensive car.If you like management games and racing, Motorsport Manager will surely please you.

												This is a great manager game. It's fun to play and very addictive. There are already enough reviews that describe the game so I will concentrate only on the negative aspects of the game.1. Fast ForwardAs in most sport manager games you can fast-forward when it comes to the match or in this case the race. There are three paces and the fastest one is still too slow. It should have a faster fast-forward.2. Create your own drivers, mechanics, designers and race teamsYou can only create a manager character. You should at least be able to create your own race teams. The game offers 3 leagues each consisting of 10 race teams. There is no option to create your own. The same applies to drivers, mechanics and designers.3. Influence of manager characterYour own manager character has three attributes with an option for a special trait. If you don't plan on changing the race teams your attributes are pretty useless. There should be attributes like ""negotiation"" which affect the outcome of negotiating contracts.4. Vote of the manager committeeEach league has a committee consisting of the managers of the race teams and each committee votes for rule changes in thier respective leagues, like which tires are allowed and stuff like that. But subjects of a rule change are predefined. You cannot initiate a rule change on your own. For example, if the rules of your league forbid refueling you cannot initiate a vote for removing this prohibition.5. Turn down Sponsor ContractsYou cannot turn down sponsor offers. You have to wait until the offer expires.6. THE BIGGEST NEGATIVE ASPECTThere is no driver with a similar name (due to license issues) and corresponding talent to Michael Schumacher! I mean, honestly? A motorsport game whithout the legend of legends? It's like playing a physics game without Einstein or Newton.In the main menue of the game there is a section called ""Workshop"" that is labeled ""Under construction"" and ""Coming soon"". So I hope some of the above mentioned aspects will be rectified.			",71,27,1,42,20,2,20

												I so wanted this to be great but it falls short in a few areas most of which have been mentioned by others. Blue flags, AI blocking. The hot patch improves things a little but it’s not fully sorted yet. My biggest disappointment is the career aspect of the game. Each new season is like starting again from scratch. There just isn’t enough recognition of the development made in the previous season. Even if you have invested the max amount of cash during a season and purchase the best fuel, materials etc. pre-season every component is awful in terms of starting performance and reliability. It then takes half the season to bring the cars up to the levels of the opposition who all seem to suffer no such penalties. I am not expecting a new car to be faultless from the start, but the car I start with ought to better reflect the investment made and the developments made in the prior season. I would be better off running last year’s car than investing in a new one each year, but that isn’t an option.I love the idea of voting to change the rules as this certainly offers some extended playability to the game. I also like the traits of staff that change over time and the little back stories, which gives them some personality.  Signing new staff could do with bringing forward, we all know that most new contracts are negotiated and sorted in the last third of the season and not exclusively post season. You ought to be able to line up replacement staff to start at a future date. Mentioned by others I know, but too many opposition cars seem to run perfectly well for far too long with problems passing others with ease and even achieving fastest laps. Clearly I don’t know what their problem is but it happens too often to be believable.Even with its faults I keep coming back for more so it can’t be all bad. Fix the annoyances and it will be a great game. Add multiplayer and online leagues and it could be fantastic! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The most important feedback: I am having a lot of fun playing this game.Since some time the biggest problem that I have is not to find games with a lot of realism, but games with a lot of fun. I have to say that MM lacks sometime of realism, but maybe is exactly for that reason that I can play it for hours and still wanting to go on for ""just another race"".The atmosphere is great and the usage of appropriate mods helps you to feel competing in real life championships. The translations are wonderful; I am playing in italian and I feel that they didn't just translated the texts, but used slangs that are typical in my language. I find the mechanism to improve the car during the season challenging and clear, but also in this case not that much realistic. I don't know if this is a conscius decision to make the game more enjoyable, but I have to say that it works and that I guess I am enjoying it more than a full realistic  process.There are still some possible improvements that should be considered also at this not realistic simulation status:- maybe is a small thing, but during the free pratice there are no ways to know how many laps will last the race! Since during the free pratice you can gain experience with the typres type, it would make sense to have know how long will be the race, in order to plan which tyres you want to test.- I played two season now and basically it never happened that one of my drivers did during the qualifying a better time in the second run than in the first one. That makes still less sense if you consider that normally at the end of the session the grip is higher!- it would be great if it would be possible to copy the balance of a car to the other one and above all to copy the balance from the previous year! After finding the right setting in 2016 I don't have the will to start from scratch for the 2017... I would prefere to use the set of the previous year as basis (I am pretty sure that it is how it works in real race as well :) ). You could also consider how much time a driver raced in a specific circuit to improve his/her level of experience.- the contract negotations are horrible! I understand that you have to pay a penalty if you take a driver/engineer from another team while the older contract is still running, but you should be able to close a contract for the future. And also I think that it would be better to have more staff than just an engineer and two mechanics: it would make more challenging having a five star team.- I would like to have more transparency to understand how the car for the next year will be influenced by the development of the car for the current one.

												Hands down the best racing manager simulator I've played. In fact, it's one of the best racing games, period. So easy to learn, yet difficult to master. Fun game with tons of options and customization. Pick from multiple racing series, manage your drivers, negotiate and recruit staff, develop parts for your car and improve performance and reliability, build your HQ, handle finances, get new sponsors, win the Constructors Championship and get promoted to a better racing series, it's all very addictive. Standard team stuff aside, you get to manage your drivers/cars during practice, qualification and races as well, which was a surprise to me.A must buy for your game library if you love motorsport racing.

												This game ia absolutely gripping, and I've been binging on it for a week now.  I'm dimly aware of an expansion I was really looking forward to, and a Humble Monthly that has unlocked, but I don't care - Predator Racing needs me, and I need them.Following the advice from another review, I chose to manage Predator Racing, the bottom team in the bottom league.  It's been quite a ride, and aspects of the game have only just started to make sense to me, 58 hours in.

												Brilliant game, I have played GPW & GPM2 to death and have been waiting years for a new game to come out, even testing GPRM.Generally there are small improvements that I feel could be made, more complexity & detail around designing cars, contact being more accurately represented, signing drivers ahead of next season, drivers making less of an impact in the top tier the list goes on.But for a first time effort on a PC game, it's incredible, races are exciting and tense and the financial side works nicely.First season with Van Doort Racing, car had developed nicely and I was regularly challenging for top half of points. Mid way through the belgian GP it starts to rain, I pit my lead driver and leave the No2 out. She crashes causing safety car to come out, everyone pits for inters moving me up to 3rd, but i check the weather and decide to pit for dries. after a couple of laps safety car comes in and everyone pits for dries, I find myself leading, and Schmidt holds off everyone to just take our first ever win.TL:DR Recreated Singapore 2008 by causing one of my drivers to crash and taking the lead under the safety car.

												There hasn't been a good motorsport manager game for a long time, so I personally had pretty high expectations. And honestly, the game hasn't disappointed me at all!While the game seems complex at first, the game is surprisingly easy to learn, but still complex enough to satisfiy the more hardcore manager audience.When managing a small team, you will find yourself drinking champagne in your livingroom when you manage to get a double points finish. And when managing a top team, you will find yourself slamming your fist into the table when your driver crashes out from the lead of the race... Man I really liked that table...While the game isn't without it's flaws, it's already extremly enyoyable, and the devs are very active and seem very dedicated to making the game even better. And I'm very optimistic that the game will become even better in the future.Long story short; the game is awesome!			",3,1,1,2,5,0,7

												Hands down the best racing manager simulator I've played. In fact, it's one of the best racing games, period. So easy to learn, yet difficult to master. Fun game with tons of options and customization. Pick from multiple racing series, manage your drivers, negotiate and recruit staff, develop parts for your car and improve performance and reliability, build your HQ, handle finances, get new sponsors, win the Constructors Championship and get promoted to a better racing series, it's all very addictive. Standard team stuff aside, you get to manage your drivers/cars during practice, qualification and races as well, which was a surprise to me.A must buy for your game library if you love motorsport racing.

												This game ia absolutely gripping, and I've been binging on it for a week now.  I'm dimly aware of an expansion I was really looking forward to, and a Humble Monthly that has unlocked, but I don't care - Predator Racing needs me, and I need them.Following the advice from another review, I chose to manage Predator Racing, the bottom team in the bottom league.  It's been quite a ride, and aspects of the game have only just started to make sense to me, 58 hours in.  It SEEMS innocent enough - recruit and appoint drivers, fit out cars, decide on a pit strategy and use it.But things keep happening.  Safety cars come out and destroy the lead you worked to build - or fail to.  Rain looks like it's clearing up, but sometimes it's a pause in the downpour, not an end to it.

												A fantastic title. Through my first nine (straight) hours, I experienced the highs and lows (all lows, actually) of managing my own motorsport team. Given the lack of quality of teams you can choose to begin with, even a remotely positive result will feel like a win.As the Steam description implies, this is difficult title, so this isn't for those who are looking for a casual management experience - it requires constant attention and tweaking. This is deep, and I really appreciate that. I don't even think I am far enough into the game to talk about how deep it is yet.The mobile version was great, but this is the fully realised version of the game. A very well developed gem.

												Half way trough first season. The game looks awesome and it really looks like you are making a difference. So many things to to and to pay attention. I love it!But... I'm leading the championship with the ZRT after 5 races.. And I have two wins... The car is 9th worst car on the grid... Ok, drivers are good but still I expected 10th/ 11th place in races. Also, I think this is important. I have waaaaay below minimum requirements for this game and I am running it with 45-50 FPS on medium and everything on. I mean 2.2 GHZ, 4GB RAM.. And R7 220 GPU.Edit: 1000 milion years later.. This game is good.. Worth every penny, penny, penny... I know, all right.. A bit easy but still keeping me with in because you have so much to do here.. To be honest.. I'm still waiting for someone to make combination of this and trackday.. Where you can start like a 16 YO driver and some skills.. Develop these sign contracts and have control in the races like in trackday manager but backstory and career like here.. And tracks like here.. OR.. On the other hand... Game like this, but races like (late) Race Team Simulator....This game is so fun.. But it is easy and arcadeiiishhhh...			",3,1,3,0,2,2,3

												UPDATE!!!FROM GREAT TO EPIC!!! 65 hours of playing and counting. First, its a amazing game. But I want an EPIC game, not just amazing. Im playing on MAC and with ICE 2017 MOD, and its a shame that i cant play the full mod because of been on mac. I think the ICE MOD and similars are the way this game must be. To be able to play Real F1 Cars, Pilots, Scuderias, Sponsors and the most important, tracks. so as the game say Stop spending money on JAcuzzys and helicopters and get the whole experience. F1, WEC, FE, WRC. And you will do an EPIC GAME, that I would be updating year by year. I feel the game great with the Mods, but remember, the guys wont be always doing a great mod for you. The game feel incomplete without Monaco, now MExico City, Brazil, The beautiful Rusia course, Silverstone for god sake etc.NICE GAME I was waiting something since i used top lay a Explorer page game like this, no graphs jus t numbers. Too addictive, the only complain is that you cant play with real people with real complete settings and that you can cheat saving and returning to time where you was in a better situation. I would like to see something that you have to wait the real dates, not this super speed calendar, and to see how you really managed in the week the things in a race where you don’t have to do everything for the team. As in real. Any way please release a WRC RALLY Version please!!!			",4,0,1,0,1,0,0

												Motorsport Manager is a great game if you like the small details and inproving them over time even though the game is quit repetetive as i think it would be en real life to you run you test of the car and fine tune it. then you run race with fueling and tier changes and power manegement. But for each race the car behaive in different ways and there will come dillamas where they inpact the team and cars performens in the race in good and bad ways just like in real life. Right now i have 19,3 hours and 5 seasons on me and im still in the first league becouse and im still dying to play more each time i close the game. i really like the small detailes and the impact and the way they make you do all the work on the car the team and everything else. From finding the right drivers to media handling to sponser handling. getting the best car designers and mechanincs. The only bug i have encounterd is that some times car 2 ignores a pit order but i have NOT had eny crashes of the game or what so ever race problems in the game yet.I really love the game and i play it very day now atleast a couple of hours, now the new season of Formula One dont seem so far away anymore.

												I don't write reviews very often here nor there. Now with that stated...I like this game! I missed the old Grand Prix World games and this is very good indeed. Even though it's not official it has a better system as teams move up and down in the tiers. i.e. you can be promoted and relegated! like in football. A much more sensible system than the closed ""professional"" American leagues. (side note: The American way is actually resembling a more communist economy than the cutthroat market economy America is supposed to represent). I wasn't talking about Football, but Motorsport Manager which so far is great. It's difficult and fun! (I chose a lower tier team to start with) but I am getting into it now. Very exciting stuff. Please buy it so they can make another one in a year with updates like you can create your own team from scratch, like Stewart racing etc. (however shortly lived it was).very good game! Keep it up!

												I've been waiting for a game like this for a very, very long time. The devs have truly nailed it, everything you do from managing the team to developing the car to practice and race day strategies matter. The variety and evolution of the rules is brilliant! On top of all that, there is loads of depth.Thanks for making this awesome game, I am going to lose many hours of my life playing this!Update:Can't get over how good this game is!I'm well over 20 hours in now and I still absolutely love this game. No idea how the devs managed to get everything right, creating a game that is well balanced with every gameplay mechanic being important.The thing that I'm most exited about is the replay value of this game. With the teams evolving and the rules changing there is always something new and interesting to think about. Both the on and off track elements of the game are really interesting.Also, the game can be really challenging but completely fair and extremely rewarding at the same time. The races are genuinely exiting, more so than watching real F1. The same goes for how a championship progresses over a season.After waiting for years playing F1 management games that never quite got it right, I'm so grateful that these devs managed to hit the nail on the head - with a sledgehammer!

The presentation levels are the best I've ever saw on this genre, the interface is even better than Football Manager, the tutorial and tooltips taught me everything I wanted to know and, perhaps most importantly, there's a real feeling of player agency here.

												Since I wrote my previous review after only five (5) hours of gameplay, I think it's time I update it a bit after another fifty (50) hours. Is this game good? Yes. Is it worth the purchase? Yes. At full price too? Well, I got it at 25% off so I have no regrets.Pros:- building your team from the lowest tier of racing to highest is really fun and challenging- lots of options when it comes to car development and building your own headquarters- making the right calls from pit wall during the race and having a direct impact on your drivers- weather changes during the race- qualifying is very challenging and difficult at times, finding good setup and when to go out on track is crucial- I'd list more good things, but most of it becomes a bit repetitive after every race and every season, so doesn't deserve it's own bullet point :)Cons:- AI sucks: they're basically ignoring blue flags and even trying to fight with you when you overtake them; they won't move out of your way when they're on their out lap and you're trying to set a good lap time; they'll pit for new fresh set of soft tyres just one lap before heavy rain starts (and similar weather scenarios are just as frustrating if you like competitive racing); they'll run out of fuel frequently in the last lap of the race; they're very predictable when it comes to strategy and tyre/fuel mode so after a little while you learn when you need to push and when you can take it easy.... and so on- building your HQ feels great, but the fact that after seven full seasons I don't even have half the stuff (while I tried to remain competitive on track) is slightly annoying, but I suppose it's good for some since that means you'll need to put quite some hours into this game to actually 'finish' it- some drivers are absolutely broken, for example R. Rodrigues, they need to be looked at and their skill should be tweaked a little bit- there are more little bits and pieces that can be annoying at times, such as two different drivers have same car setup and inability to copy the setup from one driver to another, but you get used to it after a whileAll in all, this is a very good game. If developers will push some updates in near future and fix the most annoying things (AI is definitely one of them), then I will rate this game 10/10. Right now, I can recommend it, probably even for the full price, but it only gets 8/10 at the moment.			",65,7,13,7,9,3,10

												I very regrettably have to not recommend playing this game. It's very ambitious, and slickly produced, but it's clear that it's a first-version game and is just not quite ready for prime time. Additionally, the dev team does not seem able to keep up with the rate of bug reports. Blue flags are handled very poorly, and a 1.1 patch came out that made the problem worse. The fact that this is so difficult to fix, coupled with the lack of communication from the team regarding further improvement, suggests that the team is a bit over their head in terms of what they tried to tackle.However, I still recommend buying it! There's a sparse but long history of racing team management games that I think this has the potential to grow into being a major part of. It's no Grand Prix Manager 2 yet, but it's probably close to Team F1 (a relatively forgotten title from the mid 90s). The team needs, and deserves, support to get a real V2 out there that's a bit better thought out in terms of race gameplay (blue flags and overtaking being the worst offenders). I don't regret spending some money to support the team and hope that they can produce something more complete in the future. It's just that this game itself is not particularly satisfying to play when the actual racing part of the game is so frustrating due to the blue flag / overtaking bug.			",0,2,2,0,5,0,0

												Some of you may recall the very old Microprose Grand Prix Manager 2 from the 90s.   This is a modern take on that.  Lots of similarity but with greater depth and options.      You will lose a lot of hours on this.       Lots of positives.  Although I am not sure about the longetivity of the game as there are not enough variables.  It is the sort of game you are likely to binge on in the early weeks but hit a point where you realise that you are just repeat grinding each season with not enough variables to make each one different.   The RNG things don't seem to have longer term consequences.   In fact, very little does.  Just as you get to a point of having decent wings or gearbox, there is only a couple of races left to use them and then its a new season and it starts all over again.        That will not worry you in the early weeks but you will hit that realisation at some point unless the DLC and patches can bring in more variety.     You will get value for money with this purchase and it is definetly worth buying.			",26,2,2,1,2,0,12

												The game decides if your drivers crash or not, no matter what you do. Reason behind this: the game tries too hard to be exciting, by incorporating random events, and not to be just a tech-fest for the F1-tech-nerds. These ""random"" events -which most likly target the player- are in consequence so drastic that your season can and will be f*ed up in matter of 3 laps. I've never seen an AI collide three times and the victim of the collision taking 3 penalties. But my drivers magically have to. The effect of this nonsene? --> No income from sponsors, loosing points on the leaderboards an in the end loosing out an price money at the end of the season. In a game where money is all this is a harsh way of creating tension, atmosphere and entertainment. In effectu you linger very long in the bottom series and the whole racing business becomes a drag and grind. I have the feeling the game tries hard to keep your progress in balance, and not let you make an ""jumps"", by which it negates any wise decisions you made. Minesweeper feels fairer that this.Also several UI decisions are inept/unsophisticated: after every loading screen the short ""video"" with the series enblem. After 3 season this gets really annoying. The intro videos are not skippable. The training session starts whith the time ticking, not paused. Which would be the 1st choice since the training is limited by time and unduly precious. Further weird stuff you regularly encounter in the game: the noinsensical interviews. There are seemingly only 2 types of interview you can give with no real effect. So just skip 'em. Seen one, seen all. The illegal parts stuff is unbalanced. Get detected too often and punished too lenient. How about get cought more seldom but when, then you should feel it.I could go on 'bout this game and its features for much longer.In the end it is sad that the game is so flawed and unbalanced, since there is no good manager game out there at this time. Maybe the devs update this product and balance it out a little bit but in this state it gets boring too fast.			",126,25,9,17,31,0,32

												Edit: As of V1.2 with this modification installed (http://steamcommunity.com/app/415200/discussions/0/152391995407646992/) the game is now reasonably playable, but I'll hold off on recommending until steam workshop is implemented. If you're desperate to play this game, then buy it and install this mod, otherwise I would still wait. Once steam workshop is implemented and they fix a few things I will change this review.Original review:At it's core it's a pretty good game, not great, but enjoyable. The management aspect is fun but too simplistic and it gets very repetitive.Unfortunately the racing/on track mechanics are completely broken. Blue flags don't work, faster cars get stuck behind lapped traffic several seconds per corner slower for laps on end, qualifying is broken every hot lap gets impeded by a car on an in/out lap, overtaking is absolute bull ♥♥♥♥ at the best of times, the list goes on. The game is simply unplayable at the moment, and yes I have tried the 1.1 hotfix, it made it worse.Maybe when they fix the on track issues and finish off steam workshop functionality so that mods can add to the management experience it'll be a good game, but at the moment it feels more like it's still in beta and it's just too frustrating to play.

												I really wanted to like this game, but it's one of the biggest let downs in a long time. I love racing, fanatically follow F1 and other formula race classes, and loved to play sports management games. So this must really be up my alley.Unfortunatly this games ticks all the wrong boxes and unlike many of the soccer management games I like this isn't doing it for me at all.Very repetativeThe number of option you have to play with in this game are very limited. You basically just upgrade parts, try to find the right setup for the cars with very minimal feedback from the drivers or your engineers, and micro manage the races. When it comes to the people management side of the game, there isn't any. Drivers can hate eachother or love eachother, but there is not a single thing you can do about it.Lack of controlA manager game becomes fun when you have the feeling of full control and more options then you can keep track of. When you need to remember to do a whole big list of things and you can tweak you team in every tiny little way possible to squeeze out more funding, better morale, more skill etc.Motorsport manager lacks most of this, in fact, it actively tries to screw you over. 4 races in a row one of my drivers was in 1st place and expanding the lead when we have 1 or 2 laps until first pitstops. Just as I cross the pitlane entry the safety car comes out and there is no way I can react. Rest of the field makes a free pit stop and my guy drops down to 14th. Ok, can happen, but not 4 races in a row.Very few tracksTier 3 only has 5 or 6 different tracksVery few budget optionsYou get very little tools to make money in this game, sporsorhip offers are dumb and always just want a sticker on your car for x amount of races. No team naming rights, overal sponsors, and only room for 6 sponsors in total.Sponsor offers often are bad, but you better take them as you won't get anything else as each offer stands for 2 races and you cannot get more then 2 offers at a time.Scouting very simplisticYou cannot search for drivers, you just have a list of all available drivers, use your scout to get more information on the driver. Scout will take a couple of weeks, then reports on the driver. Et voilla, you know all there is to know on the driver.I wish we could actually do something with our scouts, like search for young talents, or give us updates on contract situations of potentially interesting drivers at other teams. Also the scouting process takes quite long, and you won't get any info until the end. I can image that the numbers aren't final, but can't the scout give me a clue on what the expect ahead of time?Anyways, unless you don't mind a simple, repetative game I cannot recommend this game at all. Feels very much like one of those free to play micro transactions kinda games, except, it isn't free to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would recommend this game, It does build on and improve a lot over the iOS and Android versions.However, Suprisingly it has removed a few things that the Mobile version had:1. Rookies: There is no option it seems to have a driver acadamy and to promote from within. It's a feature that i really loved from the mobile game and i hope it does get added in in the future.2. Creating your own team: Unlike the mobile version, in this game you take over as manager of a team, not create your own. I found this disappointing and many people have questioned this decision and i hope they also add this into the game.3. Less championships: Not a massive issue, progress seems a lot slower in this one than in the mobile version ( I did pick Predator as my team so it could be that too ). I do expect more championships to be added though.My verdict: 7/10, Needs the missing features of the mobile game added but still a solid game and i'm definetly enjoying it!			",15,3,6,5,14,0,3

												Really good fun - what a huge step up from the mobile game! Motorsport Manager delivers on so many levels. The car part design mid season is fun and sending your cars around the track is very entertaining. However the sponsor management, lackluster scouting mechanics and buggy interviews can be cause for concern, but I believe the developer will fix these in due course. Overall I would recommend this game to any strategy or motor racing fan! Hopefully the devs can integrate some sort of system that can be used to interact with staff and drivers, which can lead to more meaningful progression in their skills or character traits. This could also be used to influence sponsors and media questions to round of the game!			",100,19,3,13,27,1,34

												The game is very fun and reminds me of the old grand prix manager from microprose.The only downside for me is that despite the pc version being more complex than the mobile original, it still has some arcade feeling, some things could be better. This will probably turn into an yearly release version like the CM games. For the second one I expect more, but to start this is very good.Pros:- graphics and style. For a manager game are very nice.- you hire drivers, staff- develop parts- control strategy- develop HQ- sponsors- rules change during seasons. You have the best engine on the grid and for the next they decide to give equal engines to everyone. Cons:- things feel a little arcade. doing laps in practice you get % bonus for the race, or tyre type that you try. It should be more about finding about tyre degradation, fuel consumption, diference between tyre compounds. - everything works a bit with the % bonus or penalty. that gives it a little arcade feeling.- during races a driver does one lap, the next he is 3 seconds faster, than 2 seconds slower. They seem a bit random. My example is exagerated but it does feel like that a bit- If your driver is cought with blue flags, even if he is faster, he will let the leader go, than pass him, than get a blue fllag and let him pass and than pass him, and so on. Hope they fix this.A good game. Hours will pass as you make a couple of races.			",0,2,1,0,0,0,0

												This game is the BOMB! The developers and producers at Football Manager could learn much from this game. As a designer myself I must say the UI and overall layout and UX is great. The tutorial is very in-depth, which is nice, because it's a pretty complex game. I started with the 2nd worst team with no pre-experience on my player ingame. My best result is as number 12 and 14 and 8th in qualifiers. It does take time before you will be making results, have great racers, crew, buildings and team. Really glad I decided to buy this.

												I would recommend this game, however this review is going to focus on the negative. Because while I recommend it, I reached a point of exhaustion and every time I see it in my library now I wonder whether I should play it, and then talk myself out of it.The game is addictive, there are a lot of nice touches. There is a lot to manage, but it gets samey after a while. I think a better word would be ""cyclic"". You don't just do the same thing all over again to get better gear, better tech, better headquarters, better positions on the leaderboard. You do these same things, get some results, and then said results are taken away from you. If you have more patience than I have, you might be fine with this. The problem for me is that the game makes you feel like you have made progress and then takes that progress away every time you start a new cycle. You believe you start from a better position, after all you get to build a better car in between seasons, but you are very wrong about that.In my first run I picked a decent team in the lower league, first season I think I hit the middle of the leaderboard. Second season, same league, I managed, eventually, to get first and get promoted to the middle league. But not without a lot of sweat. That's fine though as you feel you have achieved something. Let me explain how it all went.First season you start off with car parts with low durability. You improve both performance and reliability (they are the two sides of the coin in this case). But it takes time, so your car breaks down, and you have to go to the pit stop and hope that the AI cars also break down (they do, actually). Anyway, your car is so unreliable you wonder whether you built it out of Lego. Your car gets better, you need less pit stops, and if you play it right you eventually wind up winning the races. Unless of course a random safety car appears so everyone catches up with you and you lose that beautiful lead you built over the course of the race.I finished the first season and now I build a new chassis, which should improve your car. I upgrade my headquarters etc, although the boss slaps me a couple of times when I try to buy way more than I can afford. Spoilsport. Literally.Anyway I start the second season and the reliability of my parts is awful again. The performance tweaks are still there, but they are useless when you have to go back to the pit stop many times over. You have to do the same thing you did in the first season, however this time my drivers have more experience and yes my engine is better, etc. So I did wind up first in the league and got promoted. For a few races though, up to the middle of the season, I thought that was never going to happen.So now I went from the lower league to the middle league and I am starting over again for the third time. Same thing, all the parts I have created now have the worst durability... yes the performance has transferred over, but it's pretty much useless when your stuff breaks every two seconds.You would have thought that as you go through the seasons, your team would have learned how to build a reliable part and would not leave the cars out in the rain to rust away, right?So despite having been promoted to the middle league, I felt like I gained nothing. You also have to be very careful on the expenses mid season - if you go too overboard you will handicap yourself with debt and will not be able to build new parts but only improve the durability of the parts you built the previous season. While I understand this concept, as in reality you would need to strike the balance anyhow, it just feels the game proceeds at snailpace. I shouldn't need to concentrate on the durability as much as this game wants me to. I should keep an eye, but it shouldn't just be completely wiped out every time you start over.Despite all this, you feel you want to do one more race. Another one. And, no, I am serious, only this one then I go to bed. Then my car breaks for the twentieth time. I close the game. I haven't opened it since.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good racing game which really gives you the sense of accomplishment after a good race performance. Some things about the game has to be said though.- Every interview after race press says you've done below the expectations no matter what position you are in. My driver finished 6th on the slowest car on the grid and still the performance was dissapointing. Also midtable teams finishing on podium is ""below expectations"" according to the press.- If qualifying session starts out in wet condition, but eventually dries out the AI wont change to dry tires giving you easy front row start.- Most AI push ludicrously fast through their tires and pit 4 times when you could do easy 2 stop strategy.- Rain comes in very quickly, but also dries out in matter of 2-3 laps.- Sebastian Vettel would lose his mind if he would play this game. Blueflag system is appaaling.- Getting stuck on traffic on a qualifying lap costs about 6 seconds because the AI doesn't give a f*** if you are behind them.- If you are managing backmarker team it takes ages to get your car improved from worst on the grid. No matter how much money you spend. (If you are lucky to obtain parts from another team then you might make some progress. And those parts are usually risky resulting in penalties)- Qualifying is horrible experience. You are almost certain to be held up in traffic and its very hard not to overheat the tires and brakes on your out lap. (I always let AI do the qualifying because its needlessly complicated to do by myself).- Requires some performance to run smoothly even on lowest settings available if you want to play 3D mode, But 2D mode runs very smooth even on slower computers.Now for the positives:+ Isn't too hard if you have planned your tactics before the race. Even backmarkers can score good results, but still offers challenge in terms of executing the plans and getting both cars to the chequered flag.+ Driver traits: Traits tell something about their personality. For example some drivers are prone to crashes, some hate duelling and some are chatty. Traits really liven up the game and helps you keep interested on the game.+ Game allows you to be involved in many things during the season (designing new parts, improving new parts, scouting new drivers. finding new sponsors, designing next years car (even the livery and colours), solving problems in the team  and so on).+ The sensation when you finish a race where you started from 19th and got up to 2nd just by tactics and especially when you have the worst car on the grid.+ Politics. Game allows you to vote for rulechanges towards next season. There are many rulechanges (points system, spec parts, new tracks, new tires etc) so you can vote for or against rulechange or save your votes for the most important votes.+ Hasn't crashed once when i've played it.Some ideas for the future:- Manager should be able to talk to drivers during the race (to calm them down when they rage on about being overtaken or cheer them up when they overtake somebody)- Something to liven up the scenes after the race. Maybe podium cutscene or winner doing doughnuts at side of the road or something instead of showing the race winner in the garage.- Menus could use some real music. Doesn't bother me though because i listen my playlist here:   - More tracks would be nice on ERS. Not that nice driving some tracks twice in one season.( https://play.spotify.com/user/11147483187/playlist/1thHAkTIWJSfT3d6k4isZV )Overall 9,5/10PS: First game since F1 2013 that i didn't feel robbed after playing the game.

												If you've played the mobile version you will recognize a few things. The Graphics is about the same in terms of general style but obviusly more fleshed out with 3d modelled cars instead of dots racing aroudn the tracks. Same goes for sound, ingame messages and even the races. The mobile version feels like a light version in comparison and that's a good thing as it the PC version adds alot of new customizations and complexity to the game.Overall a very well made team sim though at times I wish I could fast simulate the actuall races as I am more into the the other sections of the game. 4/5			",113,29,4,23,22,2,39

												Some of you may recall the very old Microprose Grand Prix Manager 2 from the 90s.   This is a modern take on that.  Lots of similarity but with greater depth and options.      You will lose a lot of hours on this.       Lots of positives.  Although I am not sure about the longetivity of the game as there are not enough variables.  It is the sort of game you are likely to binge on in the early weeks but hit a point where you realise that you are just repeat grinding each season with not enough variables to make each one different.   The RNG things don't seem to have longer term consequences.   In fact, very little does.  Just as you get to a point of having decent wings or gearbox, there is only a couple of races left to use them and then its a new season and it starts all over again.        That will not worry you in the early weeks but you will hit that realisation at some point unless the DLC and patches can bring in more variety.     You will get value for money with this purchase and it is definetly worth buying.			",26,2,2,1,2,0,12

												I´ve been waiting quite a while for this, not exactly knowing what kind of manager game to expect.What I have not got was not  a ""sequel"" to the Grand Prix Manager games from the 90s due to its slight lack of depth and its comic-like appearance. So this is probably nothing (really) for the hardcore Excel-management-fans, but very nice, almost faultless ""semi-casual"" Formula-racing manager that kills a surprisingly high count of hours.The price at the current state (34,99) is on the higher regions of  ""reasonable"" for what I got.To make it short: 8.5/10  ... and I would REALLY love to see an editor/workshop support for this game.

												By far one of the most beautiful sport manager game. Some mechanics during races are quite bad, I mean, qualy are very difficult, and overall the key to win in the world championship is to develope your buildings. That's it. Development of single parts is not worth the cost in the early game.This game has a huge potential. Keep it up with updates!!			",0,0,1,0,0,0,0

												I have 165 hours in this game now. So, I feel like I know it well enough to say something about the quality.In general, it's good. I don't think there is a modern racing manager game that comes close to Motorsport Manager. But it's far from perfect. I'm not sure what changes are coming to the game, but there are certainly some areas where it can improve.The game has two major aspects to it and I think it makes the most sense to review them seperatly.1: Manager aspect. This is the part where you give interviews, hire players, fire players etc.This part of the game is so-so. The good thing about it, is that it is fairly straightforward. But when you compare it to Football Manager, it really falls short. This being said, I suspect Football Manager is the golden standard when it comes to these things. But there is a clear gap.Talking to the press needs a bit of work. To me, it adds close to nothing. Right now you're told either by the press: 'Your driver did good, right?' Or 'your driver did bad, right?' And that's just not enough to make it interesting. Also it's odd that when you're leading a slower team and your driver gets 8th, which is a huge result, the press will still say you did poorly. Hiring players is fairly good. It's really simple, which has its advantages and disadvanatages. The one thing they really to add is an option to hire a driver at the start of next season, instead of at the moment the conract is agreed on. Still, one of the stronger parts of the manager aspect.Improving your car and HQ. In the game you can improve your car and your HQ. This aspect of the game is really good.I think they could add a lot to the managerial part of the game. Things like 'talking to your drivers.'2: RacesTo me, the race engine is what makes the game really special. And from what I've seen from other games, it's really hard to get this to work right. Others have tried, but I've never really seen it work. In this game it works! The races are really cool. -It's also a shame you can't make your own team or drivers yet. I would hope that these are things that are coming to the game. But right now, they are sadly missing.			",16,12,4,20,17,2,11

												I don't like F1 very much but i like this game so much. It's hard to master a good race strategy. You have to think and make fast decisions during the race.I think the improving system for your cars lack a little of depth (and the configuration during the practice kind of boring since you move sliders, get the car out , bring the car, move again a little the sliders and etc...).It's still a very fun game who need maybe a couple of update to be perfect.

												This is a fun little game. It's not super ultra realistic so if that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere, but it's pretty immersive if you aren't super focused on the real life workings of racing teams. It strikes a good balance between gameplay mechanics and simulation, not too arcadey but fun to play. It does what you'd expect, you hire drivers and mechanics, you design the cars (in terms of suppliers of parts, not visually) and parts, you manage sponsers and then you send them all off to race and win, managing the team tactics from above.

												We Microprose Grand Prix Manager fans have waited this a long time. Yeah, it's really good but full of bugs too. Just hoping they fix asap ie. drive thru pit penalty from AI, it doesn't work and retired cars racing still without fuel with big black smoke behind them. Also that marketability attribute is bit annoying because it's most important stat for driver, no matter how fast he is, bad marketability and you can't take him, because you can get only 1-2 star sponsors after that.  Also when you have testing track you should be allowed to use it too, like testing cars etc. Now driver stats rise really really slow even with good facilities.Just hoping that developers will take it to finish, it will be an ultimate Formula racing game after that.--- Edit 20.03.2017 --- Black smoke bug is gone now, thanks to developers.

												When I saw this game for the first time, I thought to myself ""How on EARTH can they justify porting this from mobile to PC and charge nearly 10 times the price?!"" They did.Motorsport Manager is a management game; in the vein of the once popular Football Manager (FM) series. (in which I was a dedicated follower of before it turned to ♥♥♥♥) The concept is simple. Take an F1 or GT Team and turn them into world beaters, hiring the best staff and drivers, building your car and just attempt to dominate the race tracks.The graphics are pretty alright, but miles better than the 3D Match Engine that FM has been trying to perfect since 2009.For a management game though, graphics are not important whatsoever and the lesser the graphical fidelity the more compatible it is with older machines, which can be the computer of choice for a bunch of Management sim players.If your computer can't do 3D either, there is a 2D engine that does the job as well.The management options really look like a mobile game at this point. The HQ building really looks like it came from the idea of using a touch device and it is a bit clunky in that regard. Parts building also seem pretty simplistic, with several ranks of parts, each rank unlocked by a different HQ building.Drivers are also important, right? So hire and fire as you need. Each driver has a ability between 1 and five stars, each obviously based (at least in Not-F1) on a real life F1 driver. Though some of their ficticious conterparts are female, so if you want to see genderbent Nico Rosberg or Daniel Riccardo this is for you (?). Contracts are not as complex as FM, thankfully. Just select bonuses, wages, contract length, driver status. Though stats and the driver's willingness to sign a contract comes with the traits system. They can either be personality traits or temporary events. All of them affecting things like stats, willingness to renew contracts (damn you rivalry) and morale, all positively or negatively.Of course, where is the money gonna come from? You need money for next season's car, you need to pay your staff and for your HQ's upkeep, oh, and you also need to repair your car after each race right? You CAN always race and hope for a top 2 finish all the time, or you could sign sponsors. Sponsors are simple. There are 2 kinds, and you can have 3 of each. Almost all of them will pay upfront. The first category will have you pick a target finishing position for qualifying and the race. Meet one and you will get half the bonus. Meet the other and you has all the monies. The other one pays after every race, and of course each sponsor has a set length of races before it expires.Now on to the races. The three stages are practice, qualifying, and the race itself. Practice allows you to tune your car settings (if you have no idea where to begin, there is a Steam guide with good starting settings that you will need to tune as each car and driver have different optimal settings.) and there is a set time limit to get said combination. Secondly is the qualifying stage. Use that setting you found to attempt to get the podium! And then the race. You now have to manage fuel, tyre durability and type, pit stops and car conditions. It is about playing your cards right and hoping that it is enough, as your drivers or car might not be able to secure the target.Overall, Motorsport Manager is a great game, despite it's simplicity. And if you are annoyed by the non-licensed drivers, the Steam Workshop has ya covered. I really fell in love from the start and I really want to play more.8/10			",113,23,11,33,37,4,23

												I'm currently playing this for free, but will almost certainly buy, it is a pretty good game overall, easily the best of its type in almost 20 years. But I do feel there are two areas that could have and should be done better. The game seems confused as to whether my team is an engine supplier or not. Yes, I buy engines from a supplier, but then I have to develop them? Pick a direction, because while I am no F1 expert, I do not think this is how it works. A team either buys them or develops them, and for the purpose of this game, would rather ONLY develop them and have that tied to a headquarters building. Why am I buying engines that I have to design anyway? Would be nice if the developers of this game had played F1 2000. I really like the way R&D works in this game, but what is researched and how it works could use some lessons from F1 2000. The chassis should be researched by my head designer and maybe allow us to hire engineers to assign to different tasks. The only suppliers we need are brakes, tires, fuel?, you know, the same things real F1 teams buy. The rest should be developed, like barge boards, nose cones, suspension, wings, and whatever else. And lets make the offseason more interesting....why are we not developing parts during the offseason? Why is my staff all paid by the race? Should this not be a salary so they are getting paid all year to, I don't know, work? Headquaters in F1 has no offseason.              So on to my second concern. If anyone has played the old PC game, Indy 500, I feel that it had the best I have seen in how it does the setup for a race. It feels realistic, and this is what i thought the telemetry building would help with. But it all comes down to driver feedback, not at all realistic compared to F1 and the MOUNTIAN of data they get from telemerty. Using tire temps to set pressure and camber was cool. Brake balance, won't find it in this game. The setup  could have been much more interesting and realistic.             Overall, this is a better game than the two I mentioned, but major parts of those games could have been looked at and incorporated into this game that would make it much more realistic and fun without changing the spirit of this game. I'm going to play this until it burns me out and if you, like me, have been waiting since F1 2000 for a new game like this, your wait is finally over.			",28,3,4,5,13,0,15

												I really enjoy this game, after trying it for free, I couldn't resist the purchase! The game is not over complicated, which should appeal to race enthusiasts and people who do not even know what F1 is. Mod support is great, but as of now I believe available mods are on the weak side. The only downside is the lack of sponsorship, however ICE mod made big improvements in that area. Compared to other management games, such as football, baseball etc, I prefer this game because it is less complicated and imo more fun and involving during the race. All in all, I can see myself putting a lot of hours into this game. I love how addictive this game is & seems like the devs plan on putting a lot more into this game! I recommend!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Actual racing driver here (formula cars, Europe). I played this game a lot more on android during my flights to racing events actually, PC version is fundamentally the same, just ""more of everything"".TLDR: Even though the game is full of inconsistencies virtually in every mechanic (from in-race to career), I can still recommend it. At first it ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off that some things didn't work the way they should, especially racing related. Off-track management part, even though completely unrealistic, was easier for me to accept, because even in real life this stuff varies from one extreme to another depending on a team, championship or category.Racing-wise, however it was frustrating to me how inaccurate it was in relation to actual racing.But if you stop treating this game as a ""simulator"" and accept it as fictitious in every respect, then it's fun. For sure, if it was more realistic it would not be fun for most people.Personally, I do wish it was more realistic, eventually more complex and way more difficult.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I haven't checked my real-life email in a week because of this game.Seriously addictive! Of course, much of my time with it has been modding or adjusting mods, which is normal for me. There are several mods which have some things I like and some things I don't, so I've been combining database elements (e.g. driver and mechanic list combining and removing duplicates), modifying textures, etc.You do want to make sure you have database mods to your liking before starting a career, because you can't change them once the career is started (the database information is loaded into your save file), so if you decide you want to change something, it only will work if you start a new game. For example, many mods change the top-tier championship to Formula 1, but having teams named like ""Haas F1 Team"" while realistic is not the best thing for the game, because as years go on, teams may get demoted or promoted to different series, thus you end up with Haas F1 Team that's actually in GP2/F2 and not in F1 anymore. Likewise having, for example, Carlin fielding both a GP2 and a GP3 team. What happens when the GP3 team is promoted into GP2? Four Carlin cars on the grid -- two teams with the same name.Anyway, as for the game itself: You can manage every aspect of your team -- scouting and hiring staff, contract negotiations, car setup, driver orders to manage tire and fuel usage, designing new parts, improving existing parts, expanding the team's facilities, etc. You can bend the rules and hope you don't get caught. You have to keep your team and drivers marketable in order to attract sponsors. Part of that is affected by how you respond to journalists' questions. The list goes on and on. The rules of the championship you're in, and the tracks they race on, can change from year to year via occasional voting by team managers (that's you, of course).I have another sports management game, Out Of The Park Baseball 17. I never play it, though I love baseball. I fiddled with it for a few minutes (it came in a bundle with other things), but never got into the management aspect; I'd just set some teams together and watch what happened, letting the AI manage the team. With Motorsport Manager, on the other hand, I'm always wanting to try improving the team, to the point where I haven't even been logging into my real-life email account or social media accounts because I really want to see what I can get my virtual racing team to accomplish next!

												Really hard to stop playing this!...and now for a more in depth review.  But you have to forgive me.  When I wrote the previous sentence as my review (albeit a very short review) I had been playing this game nonstop since buying it until 4 in the morning.  Good thing it was Saturday night when I bought it!So what is this game?  It is a cross between a physics-based racing game where the player NEVER gets to drive a car, and an economics sim where sponsors just want to see their name out on the track somewhere - anywhere, but preferably on the winning car, and a personality simulator where your boss and the mechanics and the drivers love you or hate you based on the decisions you make.Is it worth well over $20?  Well yes.  The graphics, even on my crappy laptop, are quite nice, and the UIs are laid out well.  The game sort of ""flows"" - you don't have to think too much what you were supposed to do because it brings everything into the forground in a very intuitive way.  But who cares?  I mean if you have a great UI and game flow but the gameplay isn't compelling, why bother?  And here is where the game is wildly addictive - because the game is a CLIFFHANGER.  There's no better word for it.  You're 26 laps into a 28 lap race, the finish line is oh so close and the tires are just about worn out and fuel tank almost empty, and the car's driver pipes up over the microphone ""hey my oil change light just came on!  This car needs Jiffy-Lube right now!  Do you want me to quit the race and come in and eat an ice cream cone while I wait for an oil change?""God are you daft - NO!!!  Then for the next 2 laps he squawks that the engine could BLOW UP at any second, and he has a good point, but that's just the risk we have to take when trying to finish - let alone win.Races are time consuming - preparing for them just as time consuming.  It's a hard uphill climb, tweaking every little parameter.  And the drivers don't know how to explain themselves beyond ""I don't like how it handles.""  Well duh.  Could you be more descriptive?  Does it need more toe in or more toe out?  ""Na - just don't feel right to me.""  Yes well thank you Mr. Neanderthal.  I'll get on that pronto!  It's just like... like... REAL LIFE!The drivers' inability to help troubleshoot tuning the vehicle makes it just that more satisfying when all the tweaking finally results in a happy driver and all those smiley faces.  Because we somehow managed to change driver's diapers and they be happy driving tringaling down the race track.  Yes you are such a good driver!Then there's tire wear management and fuel and sponsors and the freaking grounds construction.  Yes we need a wind tunnel but we can't quite afford it right now and an on-grounds race track would be nice but we'll have to make due with tuning the car just once before quailfying and my boss doesn't want me spending money on better car parts and one of the drivers is jealous I gave better brakes to the other driver's car!The core game is the race itself - but there is so much more going on that this game becomes a very grand and satisfying experience.  I haven't even got 10 hours of play in!Really the only thing to worry about is not ""will I get my money's worth"" - no the only thing to worry about is ""will I lose all my friends because I really don't want to do anything than play just one more race on Motorsport Manager.""  Yes.  Tough decision.  :)			",40,9,2,27,29,1,32

												Splendid core, some need for improvements. all around very recomendable, but be mindful there will be some annoyances here and there that, hopefully, will see improvement with future patches.Motorsport Manager is a game that gives you the command of a racing team and lets you manage every aspect from it, from the design of new parts to the improvements of your HQ. And of course, it gives you the helm at the time of calling the proper strategies as the race unfolds.Without being overly complex (probably this could do with a little bit more hardcore version for motorsport fanatics), it has a lot of aspects to it that you need to properly manage to meet success.  Even while it could be a tad more in-depth, it's a great racing manager. very fun, quite addictive, and one of those games where you'll go ""ok, one more race and that'll be it for now"", yet find yourself still playing hours later.On the not-so-positive side, the AI needs a bit of work here and there. AI drivers need some tweaks because it's rare the race you finish without witnessing 3-4 of them crawling to the finish line without fuel, there are some issues with lapped drivers (the infamous blue flag problem XD), and specially it's a bit annoying how the AI is sometimes seemingly unable to deal with slower traffic, which makes things as qualifications a bit of an infuriating thing at times (when your driver on a flying lap just slows down behind another who's just driving around slowly making his way back into the pits). And in general if you know what you're doing, it can be even easy at times (probably a better balance between driver quality vs car quality wouldn't hurt at all).The game is obviously not perfect, but the problems it has are relatively minor and I'm sure will be solved or improved by future patches. In the meantime what's left is an awesome game that, if you like racing, you'll enjoy a lot.Highly reccomended.			",35,14,1,18,36,3,31

												Even though the game is very repetitive, the races itself are pretty interesting and it's just great if your pit strategy is working. I recommend to get this game during a sale though. Using a mod with real names (either 2007 or in my case 1989 F1) makes the game a lot more enjoyable because you're a lot more connected with real teams and drivers.Pro:- easy access, but anyway enough ""depth"" to keep the game interesting- setting up the car during the practice to get the best balance (can sometimes also be annoying)- interesting races and ""cute"" graphics- building/developping new parts and deciding which driver/car will get it is interesting- F1 drama (your driver wins some races and suddenly has a new attribute self-important. Or your 2nd driver is unhappy because your other driver has the better car)Contra:- It's not possible to sign contracts in advance for next season. If you want to sign a driver, it's always immediately, causing a contract penalty- It seems like I only get bad sponsors even though my market rate isn't that bad- the e-mails from press/fans after and between races are way too repetitive			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So... I have opted for this over Football Manager this year and I have to say I am impressed.As a first go at this genre on this platform the guys have done a cracking job, the AI is good and getting your car set up and strategy right make the race weekends very interesting. I have started with one of the challenge modes (3rd attempt) and now that I am starting to understand he mechanics of the game I can see alot of time being put in to plaging this game.Politics plays an interseting part too as this can shape the way in which the following season unfolds, i also like the added touch of other team principals approaching you and offering a back hander for your vote! being in a smaller team I sell out every time!I can see later editions of this game becoming more in depth and more interestingGREAT JOB GUYS!

												This is a very good game. The overtaking could be improved though, in paticular, if you attempt to overtake up the inside, you'll more than likely fail as the driver won't break late. The outside line is usually more successful. This happens a lot around the Tondela circuit so I urge you to get rid of it if the oppurtunity arises. I also suffered a glitch in the Brazillian GP. I also think the team managers get too long e.g Kitano(McLaren) boss got to keep his job despite the team failing to score a single point. There could also be a bit more crashing and reliability failures as most races finish with all 20 runners left. Im sure there will be more catagories like Touring Cars in the next version. However, I was very impressed with the drivers lineups at the end of each season. There are a few rookies from junior catagories and the new drivers or driver swaps are usually based on performance and is very realistic. The driver problems are also good such as speeding can actually improve your marketability. The attention to detail on the tracks is very good along with aerodynamics and staff are also realistic. The driver-Mechanic relationship is very good and so to are the sponsors, HQ. The game does desperately need an EDITOR though.			",0,0,2,2,1,0,1

												If you like sports management games (OOTP, Football Manager, FHM etc) and you have at least a passing interest in motorsport, you'll be well away with this. It's not too complex where you need a degree in engineering to play, but not so simple that it becomes repetitive (though obviously you're essentially doing the same thing over and over, because that's what motorsport is).The races are often full of drama, without being so unpredictable that it feels like you're playing a random number generator. Your decisions definitely matter, the wrong strategy or bad decision making can cost your driver a few places, or even the race.The graphics, for the price, are good. Sometimes the cars can be a little bit flaky out on the track (suddenly accelerating because the game has determined an overtake should happen, for instance) but overall it looks and plays out pretty well. Although standard speed seems a tad slow, that might just be because I play on 3x speed most of the time. :pIt has fictional approximations of real life tracks, all fully featured with their various different layout options.There are several nifty feaures, like driver-mechanic chemistry giving bonuses (some awesome, some situational, some a bit meh, depending on the engineer) so it's not always a case of finding the driver and mechanic with the most star ratings that you can afford and hiring them. An experienced duo can be much better than two talented individuals who've never met. They also keep their chemistry, so if you hire a top driver away from a rival you might also want to think about hiring his/her race mechanic to keep the bonuses. Likewise, a 'better' mechanic might not have such useful bonuses as another, technically 'worse' mechanic does, so that needs to be considered to.The game is split into three 'tiers', representing GP3, GP2 and Formula One roughly, obviously without any licenses. They have differing rule sets (which can change throughout the game depending on votes that happen during the season). At game start for instance GP3 has spec rear and front wings (meaning you can't develop them, everyone uses the same), with no qualifying (grid position is determined by reverse championship order, with the guy last in the championship standings on pole position). I'm not sure how authentic this is but it's great. Likewise, GP2 has spec engines, and qualifying, etc, etc. Winning a championship will get your team invited to the series above, which is neat (you don't have to accept).Overall, I've had a lot of fun with this so far.The one massive detraction currently is that there's no editor. Like, at all. You can't edit anything. Which in a game like this is a very odd decision. I can only assume that an editor is coming later.			",111,23,4,26,19,3,22

												In love with this game. I've always been a huge fan of management side of sports games. My friends used to laugh at me cause each year when I bought NHL for the Xbox(Only console game still played to this day...) I loved the management side. Drafting, contracts, ect. Motorsport Manager warms my heart in so many ways, providing the most enjoyed elements I could ask for in a game of it's kind. Being able to start from the bottom, sign young talent, and watch it grow as you build your team up from humble beginnings, there's little that satifies more. The race-weekend elements of the game are incredible too. As someone who has only limited knowledge of racing(and most of that knowledge being from NASCAR/Stock Car racing) there's a lot to learn. However, the game does a great job of making it easy to learn for the newcomer. After a few races you'll start to understand the tendencies of the tracks. Another element I really enjoy is their inclusion of a political system in the game. Being part of group of owners/team principles and voting on future rule changes as well as circuit changes- new locations to race. Big fan of that element, and makes the game all the more interesting.As far as Con's go the only major issue I have right now is signing contracts. I really think they should include a side-by-side of your current staff member/driver(s) as a reference point when offering contracts. Alternatively, include a baseline 'asking price' for unemployed staff/drivers so you have so grasp of whereabouts the contract negotiations can begin. Right now it feels like a crapshoot. What you might imagine is reasonable comes back as insulting, and suddenly, the prospective new hire has lost their patience with you. Or, you over-pay out of fear of your initial offer being too low. There needs to be some sort of jumping point as a reference for the player to give an idea of where to start.TL;DR: As it stands, this is the best sports management game I've ever played. There's only a few small nit-picky things I'd like to see different, but I would for sure recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Sports Management games, or Autosports in general.edit: 11/26: Dev's are making some good technical patches for the game. Another thumbs up for them so far.			",27,3,1,8,34,1,21

												If you like racing, Motorsport Manager will be something you can enjoy. It is easy to get into, the UI is intuitive and simplifies the changes you do to the car setup, and there is plenty of things to upgrade at the HQ. There are quite a few bugs (such as a progression bug that limits how much of your car's stats gets passed on to the next season), but it is still fun as it is. The in-race simulation is a bit weird, with cars sometimes pulling off impossible turns and grinding pretty hard with another car, so if you're looking for a realistic in-race simulation, you won't find it here (however, a lot of the details are there, such as safety cars, tyre options, pit stop management and many others). All in all, if you like cars and racing or you would like to get into them, this game is fun and easy to learn (there is also a tutorial to teach you how the basics work). There just needs to be a command to tell drivers to shut up about intermediates.Pros: Easy to learn Simple and intuitive UI, shows car setup changes in an easy to understand format. Able to control strategies in a race and determine pit stop timings. Manage many aspects of a team. 3 league tiers, each with their own rules and the ability to vote for next season rule changes. Weather system makes for interesting tyre change and pit strategies.Cons: Pretty simple interview system. Repeated questions with the same answers to choose from. Race simulation is a little bit too simplistic than I had thought. Cars make some crazy snap turns that would certainly rip apart half the car. Unable to create your own team/drivers/etc. Cannot separate sector strategy without micro-managing during the race.Notes: The 'Expected Result' at the post-race screen is confusing. I had a driver in the 8th standing, finished 7th in the race with the team in 7th standing, but the 'Expected Result' showed my position as 5th. There have been a couple more times where this has happened. Drivers love to complain about the tiniest bit of rain and switching to inters. It would be cool to be able to zoom closer during races.

												Splendid core, some need for improvements. all around very recomendable, but be mindful there will be some annoyances here and there that, hopefully, will see improvement with future patches.Motorsport Manager is a game that gives you the command of a racing team and lets you manage every aspect from it, from the design of new parts to the improvements of your HQ. And of course, it gives you the helm at the time of calling the proper strategies as the race unfolds.Without being overly complex (probably this could do with a little bit more hardcore version for motorsport fanatics), it has a lot of aspects to it that you need to properly manage to meet success.  Even while it could be a tad more in-depth, it's a great racing manager. very fun, quite addictive, and one of those games where you'll go ""ok, one more race and that'll be it for now"", yet find yourself still playing hours later.On the not-so-positive side, the AI needs a bit of work here and there. AI drivers need some tweaks because it's rare the race you finish without witnessing 3-4 of them crawling to the finish line without fuel, there are some issues with lapped drivers (the infamous blue flag problem XD), and specially it's a bit annoying how the AI is sometimes seemingly unable to deal with slower traffic, which makes things as qualifications a bit of an infuriating thing at times (when your driver on a flying lap just slows down behind another who's just driving around slowly making his way back into the pits). And in general if you know what you're doing, it can be even easy at times (probably a better balance between driver quality vs car quality wouldn't hurt at all).The game is obviously not perfect, but the problems it has are relatively minor and I'm sure will be solved or improved by future patches. In the meantime what's left is an awesome game that, if you like racing, you'll enjoy a lot.Highly reccomended.			",35,14,1,18,36,3,31

												Decent, if a little too accessible, motorsport management simcade. Quite fun to play and can get very addictive - just take a look at my 'hours played' O_OAt times, the grind involved with building parts can be a bit frustrating and it's not without a few minor bugs here and there (even after the March patch), but it's very well presented, has a crisp-sounding genre-suitable soundtrack and has enough about it to keep you interested for quite a while.It can be a bit daunting at first, but it soon reveals itself to be more of a simcade as opposed to a hardcore management sim, which is both a pro and a con, I suppose.There are quite a few areas it could be improved (a review probably isn't the place to go into that, though), and so if an MM2 is on the cards, then I expect it could go on to be one of the must-have titles for fans of management sims.Motorsport Manager, though, is a great foundation to work from and, if I didn't know it, I wouldn't have been able to tell it had originated on the mobile-gaming platform. In fact, I didn't, and I couldn't.Check out some vids online of it being played if you're unsure (there are a few of them), but if you're on this page then there's a chance you're already somewhat interested in something like this anyway.Worth a look.

												Highly addictive, challenging, and entertaining for hours and hours, Motorsport Manager is the type of game that makes you say ""one more turn"" or, as would be more appropriate for this game, ""one more race"". Feeling disappointed after having finished 14th in that race you vowed to win? Back to the drawing board, design a new engine, and win the next one instead. Feeling angry after your race was ruined by your rear wing giving up on you two laps before the chequered flag? Time to invest in those reliability improvements. Motorsport Manager has it all.

												2 podiums and 1 win with the second lowest rated team on the game within my first 6 races, mostly just from opportunistic strategy or diving into the pits under a safety car/when the weather changes. I dare not stay up to finish just one more race weekend or it will be Saturday evening and I'll realise I haven't moved a muscle in days.I'm utterly hooked. This is the F1 management game I've been waiting for.The interface feels polished and slick, the F1 jingo is there but easy to understand, it's fun (which F1 can't always be described as), it's in depth without drowning you (it features the SC, VSC, blue flags, different formula rules, teams, politics, personalities, media, finances, RACING!) and worth every single penny.Feel like I've barely scratched the surface so far, bravo developers!

												I've always wanted to do something in the field of game development and these are the kind of games I always envisioned myself making. So when I stumbled upon the mobile version of this game a few years back, it was like getting inside my own head and playing a game which is a feeling I can't describe. Ofcourse that app was awesome and had me hooked till it got repetitive with it's limited gameplay. Then they announced the PC version and well we've all been waiting for it since then. Playing it for the first time was horrible to be honest because my PC couldn't support it. So I managed to borrow a better rig and well..... Been playing since then. If you have any interest in management games or motorsports, the game won't disappoint you. For those who don't share such interests, try it once and I promise you that you'll end up falling in love with either of the two. As these guys say... Stop Watching.. Start Winning...Take Control!

												This is a game I've wanted to play for a long time. Not nesecerily this title, but a motorsport manager game. There have been others, and they've never impressed enough for me to buy them. But, Motorsport Manager wheeled me in. It is exactly what I wanted from this type of game. It's not hardcore on the mechanical side - you don't have to know the inner workings of a car - that is kept simple. The focus is on getting your team, improving it, and winning. It is Football Manaager with cars.			",8,22,3,12,37,0,21

												Beautiful looking game, especially for a manager game. There's plenty there to keep the game interesting for many seasons. The thing I appreciate is that everything that's there seems to be a very good and solid basis to develop on further. Think similar to Football Manager's development over the years. I'm hoping this game finds a big enough market to warrant regular development, because I'm very excited for its future.			",31,3,3,5,30,0,6

												9/10 Management GameIf you like management games, this game is worth a tryIf you like F1 and not specifically just the driving, this game is worth a tryIf you like both F1 and management type games, you should obviously get thisPlenty to manage outside the track. Staff, car parts, scouting talent, driver, infrastructure, finances and sponsors etc. Decisions on race day are meaningful. One bad call can lose you your podium run. One inspired tactical change could leap frog your car from the middle all the way to the front. RNG is minimal. When things go wrong, you would've seen it coming so most things are calculated risks.Slick interface, nice art. Game flows smoothly taking you from one task to the next seamlessly. Despite the large number of screens and pages you need to look at, you rarely get lost or distracted. Nicely thought out. All the game's concepts are intuitive, the average person should be able to pick up what's going on, what needs doing and how to do them better quickly. Even without a tutorial this game is easy to understand.Teams voting on next season's ruleset is wonderful and adds much to the strategy. Love it. Team building strategic options are there. The long term game isn't linear. Players have options on how to improve their teams or more specifically, what to improve first with each choice affecting how your seasons will play out. That said, it is heavily dependent on financial resources thus playing poorer teams means less choices on how to proceed. Given the slow paced nature of Motorsport Manager, this can turn players off.Overall - managing a team in this game is both deep and satisfying.Things I didn't particularly liked and wished were different:- Gimmicky qualifying mechanics prolly there to keep grid starts a little less predictable. Not necessarily a bad thing but could've been done better. Auto resolving qualifying usually puts you at the back of the pack.- Practice session and fine tuning is fun. But UI on driver feedback could be improved. If you missed what your drivers said while they were driving, you're left guessing back at the pitstop which is annoying. And some effort could have been put into providing clues toward achieving perfect settings for all the categories. Right now, you're pretty much guessing blind.- Managing pit strategy for both your cars simultaneously on Race Day can be chaotic. Wished there were quality of life features to automate pitting your cars at predetermined intervals. As is, it's too easy to pit your cars too early or missing opportunistic pitstops when the safety car comes out all because you didn't see it in time.---25 hours played at time of writing.Started the game playing the challenge mode: Take a low tier team and top the constructor's table.Team was 8th of 10 at season start. Ended first season still at 8th.Now in season 2, averaging 6th place as manufacturer. Prolly end second season 5th.This gonna take a while.Motorsport Manager is definitely a long game.

												First time I've wrtten a Steam review and it's mostly because I want to push just how good MM is. It's been years (20?) since a decent F1 style management game came out and this one accurately depicts (albeit somewhat simply) the running of a team in one of three motorsport divisions (fictional but clearly meant to reference F1, GP2 and GP3 in real life.) You control the development of your cars, drivers, mechanics, factory and designer and there are a number of financial aspects to keep an eye on from sponsorship to your outgoings per race. You even get to vote for rule changes much as they do in real life.The races are portrayed in a 3D overhead image and you can set up your cars, take on board driver feedback and issue orders. The races can be set up to be realistically long which is a bonus as I'd worried that they might only be a few laps. This required you to have a strategy and to make a couple of pitstops along the way.My complaints about the game are minimal - it's overly simplistic in places and could use more depth, ala previous SEGA series like Football Manager, but with this being a variation on the mobile game and hopefully just a toe in the water for furure sequels, it's not too surprising. The AI is occasionally all over the place with one car blasting about half a lap into the lead early on for no real reason and the retirements and crashes seem to be quite infrequent so you'll usually have 19 of 20 cars finishing even the longest races.Overall, this is a really fun game which will hopefully continue to receive upgrades for the coming months/years. I'm really hoping it gets popular enough to find itself becoming a series of games: being licensed with real tracks, drivers and teams and thus be able to be compared  alongside Footvall Manager and OOTPB. A great start.			",78,13,23,15,28,0,34

												Normally I seldom do reviews but this game deserves it and let me tell you why with a detailed explanation.This game combines the technical aspect with a highly addictive but not repetitive gameplay.Is unprecedented in this genre for the last 20 years. Yes, better then all of them. Including the backing from a company like Sega the graphics engine is even A-list level. Buy this game before the workshops opens, it will take off when this game gets online multiplayer. IF you are a F1 fanatic. You need to buy this game.This game when you take your time, has not a high learning curve, is not a too complex tech-fest, and stays fun and highly addictive after multiple seasons.Many Pro's>> Every aspect of the F1 world, before and behind the scenes is in the gameManaging Part;- An addictive but not to complex base form the managing part.- Teams have their own facilities that improve their performances and sets a base of hierarchy in the game. The building processes are long, hard to make and must be carried over seasons providing an excellent longevity of your level of addiction. From the weather center that will provide you with more precise predictions to the scouting center you need to scout for better personnel.- Teams have their own technical staff that provides them during the season with new design, and influence the progress of the design as well during the race where race mechanicals make the difference in winning the race or not with many special traits. From designing forbidden parts to hiring brutal mechanics that can improve pit stops dramatically and give you that successful undercut.- You need an extra influx of money? Hire a pay driver.- You have a driver that stars a fierce rivalry but you do not want to lose him when he cannot stand the heat. Just give him better parts then your second driver. Or give him team orders. It is all in the game.The Racing Aspect- Different practice and qualifying formats, can be altered, and are in the game.- The virtual and physical safety car are in the game and the AI reacts swiftly and accurate to these sudden unexpected changes.- Crashes, mechanical as well as driver errors or dilemmas form the dynamic and realistic character to the race. From the problem to save the tires to choosing whether or not to lower the Engine settings, is it in the game.- Dynamic weather that results in different tactics along the AI as well as your mechanic feedbacks on the set-up as well as your drivers feedback and their capability to handle and to sense when and how to adapt.- The infamous stewards aren't missing either. From start accidents to locks up or just plain Maldonado-squeak moves resulting in penalties. Or banning your parts and giving your grid penalties. It is all in the game.The Political AspectAs hinted by the devs, the political problems that you often face are in the game. You will become a politician yourself.You are Red-Bull in the hybrid era and cannot stand to win never in Monza? Remove it from the calendar during the FIA meetings!You are Ferrari and lack race pace but improved your qualifying pace? Make qualifying an one lap show!You do not like the Pirelli high-degradation tyres? Vote. Them. Away. The Privateers will even try to get the top teams into traffic by voting to reduce the pit lane speed!In this game you can do it, and the AI also votes with multiple season in mind. Multiple Season Quality.Well now you think? 'Ah ok. But how is the game after one season, can u win easily?'Starting from day you put parts of the budget aside for next season.Your drivers can improve or get worse and gain certain traits. From Jenson Button triathlon  skills to a Verstappen that not listens or just goes full-risk in the rain.The winter season has the one of the most revolutionary aspects of this revitalized genre. You will negotiate with your design crew in the winter season and during pre-season tests how to build your car in all aspect of the chassis, ranging from - Improvability (is your design crew for your engine not yet wicked enough to catch up on an important part for that season, Mechanical grip or just the hybrid engine, then settle in the beginning for second or third and play catch up) - to choosing your engine supplier and negoiate the best config for your fuel suppliers. And yes the alliances made during the 2016 are visible in the game. e.g. IF you try to buy a Ferrari engine as Williams you will not get a discount like Haas would get.The game changes a lot during season, from all the privateer teams voting certain circuits out because your car suits the track well last year to the always recurring questions. Bring refueling back? Or even better, the choice to even cut qualifying.Sometimes political actions will screw up your build for next year because you have to rebuild it for next season, or your drivers aren' one lap wonders. Or you dropped a place in the championship last race and miss that constructor money and need to hire a pay driver because of that. Or catch your chief engineer being corrupt and passing over your designs over just before the start of the winter season. It is all in the game.Cons about the game:Do not think I work for SEGA or such, but many of the problems hinted by infamous users simply aren't true. Here to name some;- Blue flags are fixed in the previous update. Ghost cars now yay. The maximum although not damaging impact backmarkers can still have is completely normal if you watch pay-tv F1.- Crashes happen often enough especially in lower classes, although because of Mechanic-driver relations, highly reliable parts and the simple fact F1 drivers aren't that bad in handling a car, especially in the highest class of the game, some races do finish with all cars. Which is again, completely normal if you watch F1.- First corner crashes, however are seldom more then 2-driver-collisions.- Yes, there are a few mistakes, from translation errors to non-impacting graphic glitches in the menu. They are being fixed. The developers are backed by SEGA do not worry about that.- Just like real F1 the media although present and interviewing you, have to little impact. The Ferrari-Verstappen media clash and opinion are not available but can be built to have more impact in the steam workshop due to open within two months.= Camera work can use improvement although the game is already GPU-heavy. This and the game speed  - Which I would say we should be able to lower too -, should get better with the Steam workshop.All these managerial highlights, along with the not too steep learning curve and the 2017 graphics, make this game one of the best of the year already,			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have long played the mobile version of this game and could not wait for the PC version. Was it worth it? Yes...I just completed my first season and have fallen in love with the game. Throughout the season, I was able to grow in knowledge as well as improve strategies, drivers, and the car. The wonderful thing is seeing these changes in motion during practice and race-day. Acheiving my first podium was an excellent feeling and left me wanting more. The next race showed that no matter what I do, sometimes it just isn't my day. One of my drivers was plowed into, breaking the rear wing and effectively ending his race. Frustrating? Of course! But sometimes that just happens. The following race I was able to make up for it, passing the same driver that plowed into mine on the last lap for a second podium in three races.All this just to say that the game is incredibly enjoyable. It's addicting in the sense of clicking continue just to get to the next event, the planning that goes into the race, and the reward or failure that comes with it as you learn along the way. The game is great as-is, but I cannot wait to see improvements in the future as the game is wide open for just how deep it can become. As it stands, the game is already fairly deep and I've only just scratched the surface. I will update this as I play more.			",61,22,3,25,36,1,17

												Amazing presentation, and just enough detail to make your choices feel like they matter.However, the game is very light on sim elements. All of the aspects of race team management you'd expect to be there are present, but complexity generally isn't. Part performance and reliability are each abstracted to a single number, sponsors involve a single click-and-forget to sign them, and the offseason chassis design/supplier phase simplifies itself to ""spend more money, get better car"".If you can forgive that, you get a stylish and immersive way to experience the fantasy of being a race team principal, without losing the fun of that fantasy in endless number crunching.

												Being a huge fan of Fomula 1 means that you'll likely have several needs during the off-season and, as silly as this off-season has been, it still hadn't satiated my desire for motorsport competition. I started my season with Motorsport Manager in the lowest division, with the worst team just to see how quickly I could come to grasp with all the mechanics and to see how well I could manage bringing my team to a few podiums. I now have three seasons under my belt (which equate to about 10 races in the lowest division each) and I'm only barely in 8th place out of 10 teams. There's a lot to grasp early-on with Motorsport Managers mechanics and you'll likely be scratching your head as to how they all work together for a long time. Having said that, if you're willing to spend some time with the tutorial and are willing to make a few mistakes along the way, you'll find working your way up the Motorsport Manager to be really satisfying.

												Aside from the lack of license (which if you look at the Steam Workshop content available can become a mute point) there is very little to complain about. What at first appeared to be a light management sim, very quickly became a major time sink. The balance of complexity is just right. If you’re looking for a light touch simulation you can skip practise and even qualifying or race days. Alternatively, you can sit in on all sessions in real-time, tuning the balance of the car just right during practice, sending your driver out at the optimal time in qualifying, and pulling off the perfect strategy during the race.Read my full review here: http://www.glitchfreegaming.com/videogames/review/motorsport-manager ",71,11,4,8,42,1,22

												Bought this for me and my F1 nut of a girlfriend to play.Excellent game IMO.. Polished graphics and very detailed in the options you have to tweak with your team, both at race time and between races.  Practice, Qualifying and Race time is great and varied which keeps the game play fresh.at £25 it's Great Value for money too.  The lack of F1 licence and real teams/drivers does not detract from this game at all I believe.I would give it 8/10 - Two reasons it doesn't get 10/101) There is (currently - I live in hope) no option for multiplayer - would be fantastic to have more than 1 player controlled team in the race (LAN only would be fine !!)2) The NPC car AI is a bit off - Especially when cars are under blue flag.. they don't get flagged for the blue flag until after your car has been significantly held up, and you unrealistically lose a LOT of time getting around supposed blue flagged back markers.

												I haven't played a Formula 1 Manager game for like 20 years! I wasn't going to get this at first because I thought my PC would have problems getting the best out of the game, but I was glad I decided to.It's a fabulous game to play, largely because of the amount of things you can do within your team. Obviously the main attraction for me is the car setup section (loved doing this on Nascar EU on xbox 360!) During practise it helps a lot especially when you make at least 2 runs for each driver, because then you have an opportunity to get your drivers through each race with as much help as possible, along with the stratergy of the pitstops. The improving parts and reliability section is very good, seeing as this not only allows you to improve your car parts, it also allows to get their reliability during races up too. Not only that you have the opportunity to build new parts for your car (ready for next season) which is cool too, especially when you have to improve their reliability in order to possibly use them in future races.The growing of your headquarters is a good touch because it also gives you something to aim for, depending how long & how many Championships you wish to stay with one team. To be honest there isn't much wrong with it as far as I am concerned, yes there is the licensing perspective, and I do wish there were a way around it such as being able to edit driver/team names, but I can live without those.So far I have only tried the European Racing Championship section, and so far it's very good and I can't wait to start either the next season with fresh younger drivers, or move up a Championship and see how that pans out...

												This game is quite addictive. The challenge is entirely dependent on what team you choose. I personally started off in the European Championship with Team Silvia Racing. They are right in the middle of the lineup so it gave me a good foundation to start my game without handing me everything. I had to master the game in order to pull of my first win, and my goodness was that an epic moment. Ultimately, yes, the game does become ""the same thing"" over and over, BUT, your strategy changes after each race. And the depth of control over your strategy is pretty deep. The graphics are good enough, nothing to win awards over, but it does everything it needs to. Cars emit sparks when flying over corners, and smoke when a part completely breaks down. The menus can seem overwhelming from the screenshots, but the tutorial eases you in gently to come to terms with all the systems and controls you need to monitor and adjust during a race.When not in a race, you're developing parts, scouting new staff, and preparing for the next race by checking weather etc. Its not always rainbow and sunshine, I couldn't pull off a podium finish my first couple of races, and the team founder gave me an ultimatum to get a 5th position or higher in the next race or I was fired. A few attempts and Alt-F4s later, I finally fired my worst race mechanic, developed new brakes for the next race, and set my best driver for a long haul 3-pit strategy. It paid off, even with a bum engine 3 laps to finish and managed to bring home the gold and save my job.If you love the racing world, you need to pick this up. Its worth the money.

												After 200 hours playing this game I think i can say that it's a good game , for those who play management games , and have a crush on Formula 1 this game can take you to the limit and make you feel like you want to play more and more !I Took the original game team Thornton to the Top . It was chalenging and took its time , durinmg several seasons experiencing it and learning it all by myself as little can be learn't yet from fan base websites or even reviews.The game lacks on many things yet and seems a little bad when registering the results right specially when it comes to positions achieved . I believe though that it can be improved largely as much as a Football manager , but untill there the game is playable and very enjoyable .I'll give it a 81 out of 100 and I strongly recomend it for F1 lovers!

-----------  EDIT due to more time on the game ------------I needed to add to my review due to more time on the game,This game offers so much in managing your team. The stuff you can do like researching tech, improving tech and improving the car overall throughout the seasons.I think this has to be the single best F1 Managment game to date PERIOD.It always has that ""I'll just have one more game"" feel to it so the hours soon mount up.You get involved with the teams willing them on etc and the lows ofcourse :) If you like F1, I currently do not see a single reason for you not to like this game.It fills all the F1 Hunger that we may have and more.Its just a really really really well made game!10/10 -----  ORIGINAL  ----- wow wow and wow.... They actually pulled it off !   I wasnt expecting it to be this good, but it really is. A must buy for F1 lovers! Its so indeph it is unreal. It makes the Mobile verison look like a blank piece of paper. Seriously, If you love F1, and like the style of FM, and love to manage EVERY aspect of your team, then press the buy button already!!

												This is the Marriage game.You start and fall more in love with it with every single moment, you lie awake at night thinking about it. Your work suffers as you want to be with it....And then the reality takes hold. You start noticing its flaws, some of which are endearing at first then become more and more irritating. Little things, like always wanting to take you through the tutorial. Engineers telling you that the perfect Qualy set-up is actually now pants when it's the same track/tyres/weather. Achieving pole when your flying lap was started just before Qualy ended but not being given it, then watching NPC drivers drop you down the list doing the same. Drivers telling you ""That felt good"" when you could have walked it faster. Drivers getting a Drive-through Penalty for causing a crash then a. not serving the penalty and b. no evidence of any crash. NPC drivers suffering a part failure in an early lap but cracking on without needed to pit.I still have a love for this game and hope the developers get it right. It looks at lot like FM (they took a while to deliver but the ""Finished article"" was always playable) and they should speak to those guys to get it right. I was lucky as I got an FM 17 discount but this should still be considered Early Access as it's not retail ready.But the potential is huge... and if they get the F1 licence they'll want the finished article			",13,2,2,7,9,3,8

												Ther are a lot of Plus and Downs on this GameFirst of all, it’s a good game for the 50% sale, not for the full price yet... The game lacks allot of realistic things and has poorly designed AI. You can kind of get a challenge starting with low tier teams and trust me it’s gona be pain to get from a low tier GP3 team to the F1... Its way to easy on higher levels and better cars in my opinion. Also, i still has a few bugs and i recommend you to save a lot. To get detailed information about what’s wrong with the game i recommend you to watch the bug reports, linked there is one i made including a long text about game mechanics if you interested in that. http://steamcommunity.com/app/415200/discussions/2/133257959064724992/Even it has a few problems I think the concept is good. It needs some love to details and design. I’m looking forward what the moders are gona do. Usually they do better stuff than the producers. Yeah you gona see more negative than positives here and in the bug report, but I still recommend the game for players who can do their own challenges in a game to make it more interesting.

												Before i start, just want to make it clear, this is a fantastic game and well worth the money. If you enjoyed any of the Grand Prix Manager games in the 90's, you will love this game. The race weekend format is good, and a huge leap forward from the excellent mobile app. You have a short practise session (but there is plenty of time to do what you need to do) to set up the car, followed by qualifying and the race. Qualifying and the Race are similar to the mobile app, but just in much more detail. The elements of the game not directly related to the race are also very good. You can hire staff/drivers, improve facilities, and develop new components, so theres a bit of a development race going on. There is also a simple sponsorship section and you have the option to scout up and coming driver prospects. Having said all that, i do have a few minor criticisms.   1- Lapped Cars This is my only big complaint about the game at its the way backmarkers are in the game. Its not unusual for you to lose 15 seconds or more behind a single backmarker. The blue flag symbol shown to them means nothing, the backmarkers go by them then still throw a kamakazie move down the side of you to unlap/prevent themselves for being lapped. It's like the game can't tell the difference between a backmarker getting lapped and a fight for position. They really fight you for a number of laps, even if you're 5-6s a lap quicker. Having said that it does go both ways, and they do hold up your competitors also, but the level of hinderance isnt constistant. In 1 particular race though, i came out the pits in the lead by 12 seconds, and by the time i lapped the first backmarker 3 laps latter i was in 4th and 25 seconds off the new leader. Effectively my race, even for a podium, was over. That level of influence is clearly crazy and does ruin some races. I'm all for backmarkers being realistic and costing time and sometimes positions now and again, but they actually determine who wins a lot of the races.2 - Technical Staff The technical staff area of the game is pretty weak. You only specifically employ the technical director and the two race engineers. Other than that the numbers of technical staff is dictated by you facilities and you have no imput as to the quality of the staff. For example, i would like it if you could employ an areo specialist or a cheif mechanic who had a great reputation for improving pit stops etc. This area of the game just seems a bit too simplified. 3 - Set-up The way the cars set-up is decided is done individually. You cant put both drivers on different set up in practice and then pick the best and put that set-up on to both. Isn't a big deal, but it is slightly irritating.4 - Weather ForecastThis area also feels a bit weak. From what i can see you get two types of rain; Light and Heavy. I would prefer if the forecast gave you an estimated intensity from 1-10 and an estimate on how long the rain will last for. That being said, you can improve your teams weather centre to get 'improved' forecasts. I have not got that far yet, so im still not sure what that entails.5 - ContractsWhen you employ someone, it seems they have to be employed there and then. This may cause you to pay a large fee to break the employees contract. It would be better if you could have the option to sign a pre-contract agreement so you could plan for the following year.6 - Young Driver ProgramsIt would be cool if you could sign up one or two prospects and attempt to negotiate place for them in other teams or place them in junior formulae.7 - Licenicing This one is really knitpicking. The game isnt licenced so all the drivers, staff and team names have been made up. Nothing wrong with that, but it would be fantastic to have all the teams and drivers and proper support series like GP2, GP3 and F3 (maybe even karting) for you to progress through and place your young drivers once you get to the top. I have only played the game for 13 hours so some of these criticisms might be unfair if im just missing something, but even if they are correct criticisms then i would still highly recommend the game. There are a huge amount more positives than negatives.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Great racing team manager game! Finally!!!Pros:+ Very addictive gameplay!!!+ Slick presentation (UI is easy to use and well presented; graphics of races, cars and hq are really solid)+ Huge variety of different rules that apply to different championships (in lowest tier there is no qualification and starting grid is determined by championship order - it is reversed, in upper tiers you get normal qualification - short or long; all 3 championships have different points system; various pit stop options per championship - refuelling or no refuelling, full crew or smaller crew, etc. )+ Dynamic gameplay/replayability (all rules of championship may change and you get to vote on them; winning lower tier team can replace losing team in higher tier championship; team personnel changes - after my 1st season AI teams swapped drivers quite a lot; all personnel ages, etc.)+ Races can be really dynamic (weather changes, crashes, safety car and so on) and it is fun to try benefit from all those changes+ Loads of information is provided for player which gives immersion (media always comments everything, you can check progress of other championships, all teams and their personnel, etc.)Cons:- Racing engine could be improved a little (blue flags are often ignored by AI for example)- It would be nice to be able to create your own team; edit stats, names, looks of other teams and drivers- Some minor annoynaces with UI which will probably be updated soon (results table after race scrolls down automatically for example)Overall - amazing effort!!! I haven't tried their mobile game, but everyone was concerned that it will be a port with minor additions. It's not the case with this game. It is a very solid PC game and probably the best racing team manager game ever. Well done, Playsport Games!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

BUT atleast thay really matter                       2. or the core of the game is only smoke and mirrors and that would be sad as im                           hooked on this game but there are certain things happening during races that                            would only make sence if the core mechanics are just smoke and mirrors.... ) without a real official manual describeing how the hundreds of stats from the car ,the team ,the HQ ,the driver etc.interract its really hard to make decisions like a pro and feal that the results werent not always down to luck.....add this to events like being overtaken by someone on the lowest tyre setting when your all pedal to the metal and its hard not to think that the core mechanics of this game are just smoke and mirrors...and the only think that can clarify this is an official manual so players can confirm the main mechanics of the game are legit....UNTIL THANtotaly give you the benefit of the doubt as this game feals amazing and got me hooked like crazy SO great job devs and please provide that manual so we can know that this game is for real			",113,2,3,17,15,0,27

I don't have the GT DLC yet the GT Series is included in the patch meaning it takes 2/3rd of the unemployed drivers, designers, and mechanics that were once available prepatch without adding one single driver, designer, or mechanic.

												After couple hours into the game I got say its decently fun and upgrade from the mobile game. However it is not without its kinks. I have to say the mod support is rather dissapointing, for example you can only activate one mod at a time such as one database mod or one model mod which quite useless. Other then that gameplay can be quite buggy such as randomly not being able to advance for no real reason, and some aspects can take forever such upgrade you buildings for R&D which really makes upgrading your car drag. Overall game is decent defiently not worth 49.99 but if you can pick up on sale and are motorsports fan go for it. Hopefully it will in improve with the release of upcoming DLC.

												First off,  thank you guys for making such an awesome game. I've been waiting years for racing simulation since F1 manager and jeez I couldn't be happier to play something like this. When you guys came out with the app.. I was already like wow.. Okay someone s pulling the right ideas.. This game is a world of its own. Dont compare to F1 and its reality but think of how they manage to create a whole new racing world.. With its own rules, team and tracks.. Brilliant.. It's like a whole new racing league , which im so impress with. Diff drivers have diff traits which makes the game so interesting season to season.. Thank God for liveries ( hopefully create a team will be on the board soon) so the car can look diff every season. First season with ZRT autosports and already won 2 races and 3rd in drivers championship. Bloddy awesome. THANK YOU!! I'M A VERY HAPPY GAMER. Can't wait for Mods and patches. Hell I'm already anticipating the second installment. Lol. Have fun being fast and furious peeps.			",0,1,2,0,4,0,1

												The game is extremely addictive, and if anyone says it is repetitive they aren't playing it right. You have to balance so many things within the game to get a good result in each race. You have to balance your management of designers and pitcrew to match what your drivers can do. It took me some time to get it down, but now I have taken the worst team in the lowest division in the game, to the highest division in the game and I am on pace to win the championship. Finding the right balance was the hardest part of the game, (what to upgrade and who to hire.)Cons. I think they only issue that upsets me is still the blue flag issues cars have during a race. It is impossible for your car to pass a car that is a lap ahead of you, even though your car is faster. The way you have to qualify your cars is pretty stupid, and I rarely do qualifying. I just have the computer do qualifying automatically, since it is just a waste of time in my opinion. People have complained about how many women there are in the game, since it seems to be about 50/50, but that doesn't seem to bother me, since I care more about stats than what is between their legs. In the end, I would have to say the game is one of the best sims I have played in a long time, mainly because I am a motor head, and love racing.			",107,11,13,15,33,0,20

												Love this game. Very fluid play, user friendly, challenging. The depth is great. Very cool for a motorsport fan.Some gripes: the qualifying is really stupid. I have to tell the driver to speed up/slow down and the brakes and tires heat/cool at different rates so it's this supid dance with a slider. Not very in line with the performance of the car or the driver, just how perfect you can get that slider action. Really frustrating.The drivers tell you in practice if the set up is off, and they specify what. However, when you go to the setup if you don't remember what they said, you don't know which way they want it adjusted. This would be better if it told you more/less downforce, etc. so you can realy get it dialed in.Also, it doesn't make sense that parts don't carry over from season to season. A brake kit is a brake kit, no matter if the chassis changed. You have to start all over next season, repairing your engine twice per race which makes literally no sense. I spend all season making the parts reliable but have little resources/time to make good parts. You have to upgrade the reliability of those too before you put them on a car. Hard to make any headway on new parts.			",10,0,2,2,0,0,2

Theres much what can happen with u during the race (U can loose traction and hit the wall while trying to pass someone, collision with another car may occure, u can lose coz ur pilot can go fast but can not sustain the rhytm, u can decide to stay on slicks at the start of the rain then loose a traction during aquaplaning  and hit the wal, etc etc.)+ Start with formula 3 and go up to the F1 world championship+car fine tuning - no multiplayer (honestly i dont know how to lay this type of game with multiplayer but it would be fun i guess)- Sucks u in for many hours so u can forget to feed ur cat.

Most fun I've had screwing something up in a long time.Update (more than 20 hours in)Still loving this game, and highly recommended.The complexity of balancing the various moving parts (staff, car and part development, the actual races), all of it is a blast. I find in the races I'm looking forward to developing my car to be better, and in the development phase, I'm looking forward to seeing how the race goes... and in a good way!If you like motorsports, definitely worth a shot.

												Right,the number of hours shown isn't representative of what I have put into the game.      *cough*unlicensed version * cough *This game is extremely detailed, complex and rewarding for motorsport fans. This is a game which you'd think "" Right, let's do one race before I call it a night"". Boy would you be wrong. Before you know it you have somehow managed to get on the podium with a crappy car, won a million dollars and scouted a god of driver with 3.5 stars,  great improvability and 96% marketability , ""Lord Rodriguez"" ( I like to thank him everyday or everytime I start the game, it's necessary) * Thank you Lord Rodriguez *,  and promoted to APS, getting your asskicked there.. So on and so forth.. And in the real world trump has started the third world war, earth has been proved to be flat and you're  a hundred years old at least. The way the game integrates complex real life events with subtle and easily accessible features is very impressive.  The menus are easy to navigate, the graphics are excellent. You woud'nt be confused anywhere in the game because everything is so well placed and explained. Gameplay is very satisfying for a Managing game. There's also an element of humour involved, drivers joing cults, "" dating teammates"" irrespective of genders, i would love to see Seb date Kimi, really would and tell the world in what the reporters in the game call ""vomit-inducing scenes"" of the press conference. Admittedly, this game has many irritations /bugs and exploits that we could do without, like-the ever so consistent blue flags issues, even with updates constantly rolling in (-_-) -insane driver impact on race results -dodgy AI strategies, scratch that, ""***arded AI strategies ""-Pre season reliability and performance improvement exploit ( not that I am complaining about it, but an exploit nonetheless) - other minor irritations. The silver lining here is that, the devs are constantly listening to the community and are working to make the game better. The recent beta patch seems to address most of the above issues. These few inconveniences are nothing compared to the joy you get when you win the World Championship with a tier three team and build a team from scratch. With the workshop coming soon, it's only going to get better. If the devs could release an expansion or dlc with other formats and multi-player, I am ready to wave goodbye to my life and everything else. In short : If you're an F1 fan, get this game. You'll love it. 11/10.*Thank you Lord Rodriguez *			",16,1,14,1,0,0,0

												To take it short, it's a great product with some rough corners. Quite a complex, yet simple looking sport management game. Most of the aspects of the racing team day-by-day routine is neatly covered, from parts designing and fine-tuning your racing cars to financing and staff relationships. There are place to improve upon yourself always and there are a lot of place of making mistake that could heavily affect the course of your season or more.The only downsides for me are the silly cartoonish representation of people's faces in this game (could be my taste only though), unrealisic names and nations of staff (so much Asian drivers outside Japan? c'mon!) without ways of editing, a sometimes chunky on-track behavior of racing cars  (loosing several places to gain twice as more on the next lap?) and oversimplified finances. By the later I mean inability to talk to sponsors - you either accept their proposal or decline it in hopes that someone comes up with the better one soon - and usual ingame 'server updates' where you must regularly throw away half a mil...Most of such negative moments could easily be fixed with patches / updates, if the Devs & Publishers want to support their game. Motorsport Manager will greatly benefit from increasing the number of ingame championships, races, sponsors, abilities to create your own racing teams and so on - a huge potential for the updates and expansions overall.Of course, I am recommending this game to all the racing fans! There are no good racing management sims out there, but Motorsport Manager is a great game on it's own.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To take it short, it's a great product with some rough corners. Quite a complex, yet simple looking sport management game. Most of the aspects of the racing team day-by-day routine is neatly covered, from parts designing and fine-tuning your racing cars to financing and staff relationships. There are place to improve upon yourself always and there are a lot of place of making mistake that could heavily affect the course of your season or more.The only downsides for me are the silly cartoonish representation of people's faces in this game (could be my taste only though), unrealisic names and nations of staff (so much Asian drivers outside Japan? c'mon!) without ways of editing, a sometimes chunky on-track behavior of racing cars  (loosing several places to gain twice as more on the next lap?) and oversimplified finances. By the later I mean inability to talk to sponsors - you either accept their proposal or decline it in hopes that someone comes up with the better one soon - and usual ingame 'server updates' where you must regularly throw away half a mil...Most of such negative moments could easily be fixed with patches / updates, if the Devs & Publishers want to support their game. Motorsport Manager will greatly benefit from increasing the number of ingame championships, races, sponsors, abilities to create your own racing teams and so on - a huge potential for the updates and expansions overall.Of course, I am recommending this game to all the racing fans! There are no good racing management sims out there, but Motorsport Manager is a great game on it's own.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is throughly enjoyable.  The Tutorial is very good, although about half way through I was screaming at the game to try to appeal to it, to let me just play and not click so many Notification boxes.  Very fun and very addicting, it makes you want more.  The first thing I have learned, you must not just blow your money... save as much of as you can for the next season.I have played through a couple seasons now and I wondering what is next for this game.  Things I would love to see:1.  Multiplayer:  Now none of that let's change the game MP just add Multiplayer to game and play it like it stands.2.  More:  More tracks, more races per season, more and different series (Create your own?)3.  More varied color palette for your LiveryIf you love racing sports you will enjoy this game!

												10/10. Shut up and take my money!Literally BEST formula manager ever. And i dont even like management games! But this one made me sit on my ♥♥♥ and play it hours after hours! just buy it. dont ask. u wont find anything better yet+Graphics+Interface+Really deep management system+ its not like if u have a best car and pilot u will allways win the race. Theres much what can happen with u during the race (U can loose traction and hit the wall while trying to pass someone, collision with another car may occure, u can lose coz ur pilot can go fast but can not sustain the rhytm, u can decide to stay on slicks at the start of the rain then loose a traction during aquaplaning  and hit the wal, etc etc.)+ Start with formula 3 and go up to the F1 world championship+car fine tuning - no multiplayer (honestly i dont know how to lay this type of game with multiplayer but it would be fun i guess)- Sucks u in for many hours so u can forget to feed ur cat.

												Right,the number of hours shown isn't representative of what I have put into the game.      *cough*unlicensed version * cough *This game is extremely detailed, complex and rewarding for motorsport fans. This is a game which you'd think "" Right, let's do one race before I call it a night"". Boy would you be wrong. Before you know it you have somehow managed to get on the podium with a crappy car, won a million dollars and scouted a god of driver with 3.5 stars,  great improvability and 96% marketability , ""Lord Rodriguez"" ( I like to thank him everyday or everytime I start the game, it's necessary) * Thank you Lord Rodriguez *,  and promoted to APS, getting your asskicked there.. So on and so forth.. And in the real world trump has started the third world war, earth has been proved to be flat and you're  a hundred years old at least. The way the game integrates complex real life events with subtle and easily accessible features is very impressive.  The menus are easy to navigate, the graphics are excellent. You woud'nt be confused anywhere in the game because everything is so well placed and explained. Gameplay is very satisfying for a Managing game. There's also an element of humour involved, drivers joing cults, "" dating teammates"" irrespective of genders, i would love to see Seb date Kimi, really would and tell the world in what the reporters in the game call ""vomit-inducing scenes"" of the press conference. Admittedly, this game has many irritations /bugs and exploits that we could do without, like-the ever so consistent blue flags issues, even with updates constantly rolling in (-_-) -insane driver impact on race results -dodgy AI strategies, scratch that, ""***arded AI strategies ""-Pre season reliability and performance improvement exploit ( not that I am complaining about it, but an exploit nonetheless) - other minor irritations. The silver lining here is that, the devs are constantly listening to the community and are working to make the game better. The recent beta patch seems to address most of the above issues. These few inconveniences are nothing compared to the joy you get when you win the World Championship with a tier three team and build a team from scratch. With the workshop coming soon, it's only going to get better. If the devs could release an expansion or dlc with other formats and multi-player, I am ready to wave goodbye to my life and everything else. In short : If you're an F1 fan, get this game. You'll love it. 11/10.*Thank you Lord Rodriguez *			",16,1,14,1,0,0,0

												Motorsport Manager came out of left field for me, but is challenging and definitely worth the low, low cost that sets it aside from branded AAA titles. And it's on Linux to boot, yay!Manage a Formula 1 team and deal with obnoxious journalists, incompetent mechanics, and drivers with a diva-complex, all the while juggling investment opportunities and trying to get the right sponsors for your team to gain more money.The matches are engaging and you definitely need to keep your wits about you, as pitting at the wrong time can ruin your position in the charts for the remainder of the race.With the GT Series DLC there's a wholly new monster to tackle, with new ways to win (or lose) while you manage the (barely) road-legal cars in a harsh competition. If you think you did well in F1 management, GT will kick your ego down a notch.Here's hoping for more ways to utilize the HQ in-between races, maybe a MotoGP addition as future DLC? (Hey, the game's called Motorsport Manager. I'm interested in seeing how far the developers will take it.)Now if you'll excuse me, I have some races to lose.			",245,145,1,57,86,2,82

												This is a great game. I just wished it wasn't so arcady. The races themselves are excellent and exciting, but the team management and car development aspects are so dettached from reality it makes it hard to enjoy the game. In-season development is basically a simple card game. Has nothing to do with motorsport at all. I understand the need to make this fun and not a technical simulation, but I think the developer went too far. I still recommend the game as it is very well made.			",12,4,1,4,12,0,10

												This is an addictive game in which I have spent many hours! I have owned the mobile phone version for just over a year and the adaptation to P.C is fantastic. Great graphics and effects, and really easy to get a grasp of as a game. I love the game play, the dilemma's, the scouting and messaging system...it even sounds great! It's all really great fun and it's a game I will always play!It would be good in future to have some better personlisation choices of the driver, team colours etc!Just a few things that really frustrated me though... a saftey car came out and I was in 2nd place, it came out between myself and the guy in 1st...somehow everyone overtook us both then joined at the back afterwards...meaning I suddenly became 20th and had been lapped...twice by the guy in 1st too, in this case. I've been smashed into the back of *so not my fault* and then had to do a drive through penalty. Some times it's a bit glitchy with stuff like that, but it's things like that which ruin a race completely after all that hard work put in over the weekend and in the race itself. So I stopped playing after a while because I was so annoyed with things like that happening.Overall a great game which steals away hours of your time, but I'm glad I got the 50% off coupon as there are much bigger more personalised games out there for the same price.

												In its current state the AI for traffic, overtake/defending, in and outlaps in qualification is breaking the complete control over your team and drivers. Usually during a race after lap 2 it works very good and racing for position and using strategy to get higher is really well. From start to lap2 however its a chaotic sludgefest of stalling and waiting for the AI to complete their moves which usually leave your car wating at the end of the action.The game is good but not complete, i suggest waiting to purchase the game in 2-3 months when the developers have refined the AI more so you can actually play qualification and be competative in beginning of races. They are hard-ish at work since they have tried a few balance patches already since release so unless x-mas gets in the way of development they could make major changes quicker than 2-3 months.

												Runs flawlessly on a 6 yr old system ( Win 7 Pro 64, AMD FX 8350 4 Ghz, 32 Gb ram, GTX 680 4 Gb) with no crashes, lockups, hiccups or any other kind of ups at max settings. Smooth 60+ fps, although turning off ambient occlusion & tilt shift makes the graphics much less blurry to my eyes. As for the game itself, it's the new standard in racing management games IMO. The depth is amazing allowing for different strategies depending on car & driver lvl. The driver interaction via radio comms in the race itself is immersive & a bit humorous at times, as they comment on their performance & car condition. Team management outside the race is top notch as well, with choices that have to be made concerning car & facility upgrades, as well as choosing sponsors.With unlimited seasons, driver & staff scouting, retirements, drivers team hopping, and the possibility of being fired for not achieving set goals, the playability & replayability is through the roof.There are negatives as always, with several bugs as documented in the forums, no mod support (yet), no ability to start a team from scratch, cannot change driver or team names (yet), but the devs pay attention to the forums and seem to be dedicated to fixing & supporting the gameFor me, the current price wasn't even an afterthought, as I've been waiting for a game like this since 1992, however YMMV and may want to wait for a sale and/or patches/mod support to be released. Overall, it's a 9 out of 10 for me and I couldn't be more pleased with it because 24 years is a REALLY long time to wait.Peace			",18,21,5,58,23,1,20

												Just finished the tutorial which is already enough to give a firstlook, since it includes a complete race and a walkthrough through all the menues. Overall, this took me around a hour, so it is pretty in-depth in detailed.I started with the second worst team, because I like the idea of making it from the bottom to the top, even though this may take some time. The missing license of original teams and drivers is not a big deal and once this game gets modding support, thanks to Steam Workshop, this may change.I'd like to create a Pro/Cons list, but even without wearing fanboy glasses, I don't have any Cons in mind so far. But this could change over time. Maybe the game gets boring fast or hilariously unrealistic. Who knows. If that's the case, I'll edit this review.But for now, the game runs perfectly fine for me without any issues on max details with locked 60fps (no need to cry here. You seriously don't need those 200fps). You can really feel the polish under your nails when scratching over the games surface. The overview doesn't suffer from all those menues like in EAs FM games (at least for beginners). The ""controls"" in a live race are pretty simple and easy to understand. Graphics look great for this a simulator game.I love it so far and will hopefully be able to make enough money to build a wall in front of Mexi.. to beat ""Mercedes""!Edit: Even working better now after the first patch.

												Super Job by Playsport Games and SEGA.So basically you create your team principle where basically you run the team and dictate what direction of development the team should go throughout the season. You also control staffing, drivers and any Head Quarter upgrades. I would recomend starting up with an average team to learn. I chose the second worst team in Euro Championship and managing on a limited budget is a bit tricky in this game. Although, the nice thing about being a team principle, you can jump ship and go to another team in the current series or another. So your never stuck at one place. One minor thing I wish was in the game would be not having the abillity to generate a race strategy pre-race but still have the ability to go off script like in F1 2016. But that is minor and overall the game has a solid foundation with its first installment. The only negative I have atm... is the fact that the speed delta's between each of the selections that dictate how hard the drivers push on the track. Just seems a tad unrealistic. I have almost no pace when placing it conserving while the AI seems to have a little more than my guys/girls do. That is the only thing I have that could be optimised a bit more.Totally recomend it to anyone into racing... its a blast.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Badly flawed manager game, sadly because I was expecting more and better. Like there is no engine deals at all, you can´t do driver contracts for the next season. In the races mechanical failures are very rare and there is no accidents or collisions at all. It´s rather simple and monotonous ""F1"" manager game, without any licenses. This game had potential for much better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What day is it?This game is one of the best open wheel team manager simulator on the market! I use to play TrackDay Manager... Use to. This game blows it out of the water. You start the game as the manager for one of any number of teams. You get to choose between starting from scratch with a green crew, car, and sponsors or you can choose a team with all the bells and whistles already in place! Manage every aspect of your team with the ability to design and build different components for your car. Hire the driver type you want. Hire the mechanics and designer you want. CUSTOMIZATION IS AMAZING in this game. Highly, HIGHLY addicting gameplay! I have racked up 51 hours and only owned the game a handful of days now. You want to race. You need to compete! You are compelled to continue to grow your empire as you build upon previous seasons. TL;DR:If you like racing sim managers, BUY THIS GAME! You will not regret it. It is a bit pricey, but worth every cent! Edit: 12-31-2016Now, after 92 hours of gameplay the ""Blue Flag"" bug has either been fixed or severely blown out of proportion. I have even moved up a league with the same company, ZRT, and have had nothing but fun! Upgrading your facilities to faster repair and improve your parts is amazing, so is the sponsorship aspect. Managing funds and a balance between drivers, tanking one driver to really have a number 1 with the best equipment, or just remaining mediocre and meeting the 9th or above quota... this game has a play style for everyone!

												Unexpectedly good!Full disclosure I'm in my thirties, been a gamer from an early age to give you perspective. The Good1. It's very easy to pick up, shallow learning curve.2. Some nice car customization options for (shallow) player choice3. Good variability for race events and track challenges.4. The possibility of scouting and finding the right staff can really enhance gameplay.5. Generally the game looks nice and is enjoyable.The Bad1. Insufficient depth for long term gaming for an adult.2. Repetitive non-engaging ""messages""3. Most interview questions and scenerios have no positive outcome, only negative or neutral.The UglySo much untapped potential in the game. I'm sure the devs know that too.Some ideas:1. Choosing season rules to start with2. Choosing fuel amounts3. Driver injury, long term, short term, recovery times.4. Sponsorship structure needs a rethink.5. Interactive specific training for drivers. (ideally for everyone)6. We have a test track? - let's use it!7. Telemetry data? would be nice to see something telemetry looking like with some options to improve/invest/fix8. Press events! - you know when all the drivers get to sit, pretend they like it and talk to the media...9. Fake news. Not just email but some paper headlines or something. (Pretty cheap to create)10. Driver seat mode! - can we get some watered down driver seat 3D view? (maybe for MM2?)11. Multiplayer!!! - (definitely MM2 territory)12. Track danger level (some tracks can be much more dangerous than others)13. Repair bill! - some drivers are awesome but they have no smoothness and they destroy engines. Worse, sometimes the car crashes and is totalled. Taht costs.14. Recoverability. Sometimes a driver runs wide or into the gravel and can still recover!I could probably extend this to 50 so I'll stop here.Verdict:Should you get this game? - yes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												hi where to start . lets start by saying this game is the best ever grand prix manager ever. for people who are fans you will not be disappointed it has it all from building facilities to driver hire crew and sponsers design and upgrades of parts very tactical by this i mean choices matter in practise qualifing and the race, tyres, weather, pit times, rules, illegal parts that you have made. the best ever racing manger i ever played was  a game called (microprose) grand prix manager 2 i played all before and all games after and this one nails it close and definitely better than microprose grand prix manager 2 so if you have played gpm2 and have longed for a game that is in the same style with heaps more playability and loads better game play and really swell graphics and o yeh did i mention its a real good challenging game car set up and driver mechanics are also important for wining race in short there is no down side to this game its definitely a game that you will play for ever and ever buy it even at full price will be the best money you spend on steam guaranteed hope this helps you all happy gaming ps i got the game 2 days ago and i have played 16 or 18 houres just like that :P time flyes with this game			",65,10,7,16,24,0,4

												Love the game but have to admit recent patches have made the game quite stupid. I dominate the practice sessions but then the AI seemingly do a mercedes in real life F1 and find 2-3 seconds from practice yet I can only manage around half a second in qualifying despite have excellent feedback on all three styles. Even when my engine is on medium driving style medium I am still faster in practice sessions. Would help if the AI showed some pace in practice instead of letting me assume that I had an 'easy' 1-2 start. As for the race getting attacked/ outpaced by the AI when they have low low settings or I have just pitted for fresh tyres and still not getting the desired 'undercut' is making me become disenchanted with the game, Thought cars with fresh tyres were supposed to have an advantage yet when I undercut it doesnt work.

Wrong PlatformAs a mobile game it would be a nice one. Unfortunately for PC it lacks depth and fun.I'm not a F1 addict and i'm used to manage football clubs. The menu style reminds me of the sega FM. I still feel quite lost in the menu ui. It feels more like a handy app instead of a decent ui.Gfx lack a lot. Even the hyped 3d mode is a joke. It is painful to watch the cars especially in fast forward. A) its not detailed enough and B) it feels too artificial and railroaded and not gentle as in the tv. I wish they had taken some real moves from F1 races to combine them in various ways ingame. FM is also far from perfect but at least some moves gives you the impression of having a decent match.Switching vies would be great like cockpit mode or helm camera... with at least some driving mini games here.The sound is awful too. Tedious motor noises during a race. The music in the car menus / during car presentation is quite nice but the soundenvironment during races... cmon. Is a motorsport game it need different sounds. Why not kombining damaged car parts with eg motor sounds; individual car sounds etc.?So whats under the hood?Basically its mini game after mini game. Like tuning your car in training sessions and warming up your tires for qualifying. In these tasks and all the other stuff you can do (research, etc.) it boils down to find the right slider location between a ""+"" and a ""-"".  ZzzzzzZZZZZzzzz Not very appealing. I'm not a car freak nor I like to watch races but even for me it lacks genre specifics. Its nice that the drivers give feedback on car behaviour but it tells you what to do and you juggle 4(?) sliders to improve according to the feedback. So your whole tuning is virtual and dumped down. Its also strange that you have to figue out the whole car setup for every race track. Why not go more into details and compete with drivers and teams around your own standings? Why can't i use questions for the drivers or engine noises to tune different parts of the car? Why just symbols for the parts of a car instead of various pictures of chrome and glittering oil?You can develop stuff and expand your HQ but even here its somehow limited to big parts like engine or breaks. Why cant i give command for certain areas of the track eg to improve my drivers abilities. Why can't i tune the engine in different ways? Its just power vs reliability. Thats not enough to get into the technical nerd side. Where are different materials? Why no travel logistics?Press and driver behaviour should also play a better role. Interviews suck in FM but now and then in MP they would make sence. Season preparation with team building etc. - would also be great. Rivalry with other teams - currently it seems its just virtual and you can't comment on others. You have to watch the driver in front of you to get an idea when to go to the box but why not make it more sophisticates like a box area which gets busy when they prepare a stop? - Such important details are missing. Everything feels very stiff and railroaded instead of living and breating gasoline.Its good to see manager games are not dead. I also like women in game. Its not a F1 license so why not be gender equal?! But there's not much else appealing for me. Thx for the tryout SEGA, i know now i won't buy it even when on sale. Its Just not enough to catch me but i can't tell if a F1 fan will like it more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I loved the Grand Prix Manager series back in the day. This one comes close but no cigar. If it was half a price cheaper It would be a good price but for what it is it is a bit pricey. I mean I still recomend it just because we don't have enything else in that genre right now but there is a spot to fill and Motorsport Manager unfortunately not filling it as it could. As someone already mentioned for that price this game should have voiced acting and at least some nice animations like for wining races or some major event (there is almost nothing). The staff and drivers' faces end their ""variety"" is pathetic. Just one graphic of a strange looking guy and gall and different hair options slapped on to make them look different - ARE YOU SERIOUS??? Circuit and cars animations are sufficient but could be better (for the price) and not so small. So grab it only when on sale if you can't hold on for fully fleshed out racing management simulator but it might be forever mind you :(.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Love the sound of the up-shifts and down-shifts. They even got the sound immersion spot on.. While watching the race there is no music. If go look at some info or menu the nice music kicks in, then back to the game and the music goes away again. Perfect.I have absolutley no complaints so far.

The driver 1st won the race and beat 2nd place driver would you want to hire #1 (they are all ready on your team) and you cant respond in a way that will help your team, if you say yes I want #1 then #2 loses 30% morale or if you choose no I dont want driver 1 then for 40 weeks you cant get into signing with #1... The build your own team addon is great, I just wish there was even more you could do, you always start off with nothing and have to make your team good, sometimes it would be fun to start at the top with everything... but I'm sure more will be added soon			",88,3,1,31,19,2,44

												This is an addictive game in which I have spent many hours! I have owned the mobile phone version for just over a year and the adaptation to P.C is fantastic. Great graphics and effects, and really easy to get a grasp of as a game. I love the game play, the dilemma's, the scouting and messaging system...it even sounds great! It's all really great fun and it's a game I will always play!It would be good in future to have some better personlisation choices of the driver, team colours etc!Just a few things that really frustrated me though... a saftey car came out and I was in 2nd place, it came out between myself and the guy in 1st...somehow everyone overtook us both then joined at the back afterwards...meaning I suddenly became 20th and had been lapped...twice by the guy in 1st too, in this case. I've been smashed into the back of *so not my fault* and then had to do a drive through penalty. Some times it's a bit glitchy with stuff like that, but it's things like that which ruin a race completely after all that hard work put in over the weekend and in the race itself. So I stopped playing after a while because I was so annoyed with things like that happening.Overall a great game which steals away hours of your time, but I'm glad I got the 50% off coupon as there are much bigger more personalised games out there for the same price.

Even the gameplay of seeing the cars on the track is amazing.I cannot recommend this game enough... Simply the best.Finally i can rest the copy i have of GPM2, RIP GPM2, you always will be in my heart.PS 2: A patch just came out, the now is even more perfect			",138,22,12,37,19,4,62

												This is a great game. I just wished it wasn't so arcady. The races themselves are excellent and exciting, but the team management and car development aspects are so dettached from reality it makes it hard to enjoy the game. In-season development is basically a simple card game. Has nothing to do with motorsport at all. I understand the need to make this fun and not a technical simulation, but I think the developer went too far. I still recommend the game as it is very well made.			",12,4,1,4,12,0,10

												Fantastic simulator. Completed my first race. There is a lot to take in and learn, but I am looking forward to it. Worth the price of admission. Christian West and his new team really pulled it off. Tons more depth than the mobile version, which was not lacking or shallow. The sights and sounds are spot on. Love the sound of the up-shifts and down-shifts. They even got the sound immersion spot on.. While watching the race there is no music. If go look at some info or menu the nice music kicks in, then back to the game and the music goes away again. Perfect.I have absolutley no complaints so far. Thank you to all of the developers and staff working with Mr. West.Best regards.			",0,0,1,0,3,0,0

												Way to expensive for what it is, the cars don't really follow any physics so everything is kinda basic ""feeling"" the depth is kind of false. It's a shame cause if the car engine was better and more complex it would be a great management game.It's a super lite casual game, is it nothing like the b spec mode in gran turismo where the drivers are governed by the physics of the car and how you set it up, the cars are on rails and driven by math equations a cheap method in my opinion. It is worth around 6-7 bucks at most.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It is an OK game now they fixed the major bugs. However...I Updated my graphics card driver, now the game won't start. (Nvidia Geforce GTX 980TI)the driving lanes are too rigid and it looks more like a board game made computer game than a racing simulator. there is no ""ideal line"" the road is litterally divided up into paths and a car chooses one, then has to stay there either for a certain amount of time or till the curve-combo is done, he does not care if it is a triple curve turn and it is only a good line for the first curve, so he may pass 1 car on the first part of the curve, but since he is stuck i his line and can not block the opponnents in the other two curves he looses 3-4 positions.Tirewear only applies to you, well you can go full speed on tires till they have 15%, while the AI happily continues right down to 5% before slowing down.later in races when passing lapped cars, you will see your driver get stuck behind the lapped car that is just slowing down more and more to let you pass, but your driver insists on loosing 2-3 even 4 positions behind this lapped car before going ""oh, well I might as well change lane and get on with the racing"". Same goes with cars with blown tires or that run out of fuel. I lost several races getting stuck behind out of fuel cars while the 2nd place caught 20-30 seconds on the last lap and ran right past me.The cars always start with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ durability which means you never win the first race of the season, you have to pit 5-6 times of 20-30 second pit stops to fix your car all the time, furthermore the ""pitstop modes"" are so bad, a pit stop will never be don ""taking it easy"" it will alsways be done as fast as ♥♥♥♥ing possible, and there is NEVER a 30% fail chance. I am an abid F1 fan, and during this seaons there has been a 4.6% fail chance on pit stops... 4.6% on all pit stops, from all teams, all races! and they never vary from changing tires in 3-9 seconds... if they make a good pit stop it is 2.4-2.8 seconds and if they make a mistake it is maybe 3.7-4.3seconds  W..T..F are they diddling about with loosing 6-10 seconds on a single failed tire???if you have refuelling in races and the AI decides on small tanks, ♥♥♥♥ the hard tires, your tank is so small you run out of fuel before you run out of tires so just go U-soft or S-soft, whatever is softest (well unless if your driver has really bad smoothness - that effects tire wear) but any decent F1 driver has 13-20 smoothness and then tires last longer than full tank and you just go softest compound to run faster laps. (there is no tire rule like in F1 so you do not have to use different compounds you can go softest compound all the way through without penalty)the worst thing is that they have special temporary traits that ♥♥♥♥ up your drivers...Example : my driver has 19 braking skill, and is 86% done with training it to 20 and max...He gets a temporary trait called ""Renewed passion"" boosting all his skills by 1. Boom my drivers braking skill is now 20 with 0% progress and that is max so he no longer trains the skill, that lasts 20 weeks, 20 weeks later, my driver goes back to 19 braking skill, but with 0% progress...The worst thing about this bug is - if the temporary booster actually hits the drivers maximum potential during the boost, the driver won't be able to gain skill, eever... even after the temporary boost is gone and the driver is no longer at the max potential, no progress again, ever.What a horrible piece of ♥♥♥♥, that everyone seems to love. BAH!			",22,2,4,7,14,0,13

												I want to like this game. There's a lot to like. First of all, it's not much like the mobile game, there's far more depth. The cars look great, the sound is nice, the tracks are good. There's a lot of well done, immersive aspects to the game.The problem is when you start to succeed. You don't even have to be winning, just get your team to 4th or 5th in the championship. Then, whammo! Your drivers fight each other, they get gambling debts, they join a cult, become a cult leader, have a failed recording career, etc... I mean, it just never ends, not until your team is at the bottom. The voting on championship rules is also terrible, the game is predisposed to the current F1 garbage rules. On the rare occasion you get a rule passed, it gets voted out the next season.Unfortunately it just makes the game unenjoyable & incredibly frustrating. I play games to relax & escape, not to be constantly jerked around. If I hadn't sunk so many hours into this, I'd try to return it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												i started off with a mid-range team (windsor)seems half finish...  the management is not advanced enough. racing sim is not any good either. even all traffic adds 2-5 secs on laptimes, even blue flag oponents during race adds heaps of time.   cars dont have a great racing line... when a car in front breaks early so do you instead of overtaking.. seems to be little logic in ths race sim...Gets boring pretty fast and money is scarse... development take too long and parts gets banned too often... pretty far off real F1.... i played 1 season then diddnt bother anymore.after playing football manager (also from Sega, and pretty similar) i expected lots more...the most correct thing is the low price on the game....score 4,5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been waiting for a long time for a good motorsport manager. The basic ideas and concepts of the game seem to be really good. I bought the game a few days after release. No game crashes, some strange behaviors, some minos bugs. I was positively suprised. BUT, the big big BUT: The race has some big bugs. Blue flag bug affecting lapped and lapping cars and other stuff that makes the racing totally frustrationg and many results just random.Was makes me really sad is, that these kind of bugs were sooooo obvious that I must assume, that the customer is abused as a beta tester once again. Good concepts, great ideas... could have beend a great game. I was waiting almost a month now, it is still not playable (1.1 with beta Hotfix). The patch made it even worse in some parts. So I cannot recommend this game. It's a pity.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very good game! Overall, I'd rate it 8/10.Positives:The game is addicting, and absoultely very fun. I absolutely enjoy it very much. There isn't much to say other than ""it's just a really fun game, with very interesting dynamics"".Cons:The bugs. There are several bugs, that really...bug me. 1. If the 1st place car laps any other cars, when he finishes the race, everyone else does too when they cross the checkered line. Anybody he laps doesn't do their ""extra lap"" after he finishes. They finish right after. For instance, if the 1st place car laps the 20th place car, but not the 19th place car, when the 1st place crosses the finish line, the 20th should have to cross the finish line then do 1 more lap, right? No, the 20th place car crosses the finish line and comes in 20th place, while the 19th place car has to keep on going for the rest of his lap, which ends up meaning the 20th place car finishes the race before the 19th place, but finishes behind #19 in the standings. Basically once the 1st place car crosses the line, the race is over for everyone else when they cross the line as well, and they finish in whatever place they currently were. This takes away from those ""last lap"" battles. It actually happened to me, where the 1st place car lapped me and I was in 6th place, ready to overtake 5th place. He crossed the finish line and we still had 1.5 laps to go...and I easily would have gotten 5th or even 4th place if I had all 1.5 laps to use. But my race ended after 0.5 laps, and I got stuck with 6th place. Very annoying.More bugs. The financials/bonuses seem to be very wonky. I toggled between a 1mil bonus, and a 1.8 mil bonus, and it would show I'd make MORE money with the 1mil bonus selected...what?!?!My last con, is the seasons. Every season, you start with a brand new car (you buy this car with money saved from the previous year/season).  And every season, you start right back at square 1 with a new car and no upgrades, with the ability to only build the ♥♥♥♥♥iest upgrades on your parts, and everything is ♥♥♥♥ing broken, and low durability, and it really takes the fun out of the first few races of the season. All the hard work I put in last season? Gone. Upgrades are tiered. Once you build tier 1 upgrade, then you can build tier 2. Then you can build tier 3. And by the end of the season, you have a monster car with tier 2-4 upgrades, and all your hard work, and then next season...you have to build tier 1 upgrades again. Very frustrating to me I think. It's basically starting a ""new game"" every season in terms of your car. Your drivers and staff all retain their improvements though, so that's alright.I know I gripped a LOT more than I praised the game, which is weird because I gave it 8/10...but those are literally the only things wrong with the game I truly believe. other than those couple of issues, this game is phenomenal. And those couple of issues (bugs + new car every seasons wtf;oaisjhdf;oaisdjf;aosdfj), are the reason I didn't rate it a 9 or 9.5/10.Buy the damn game!			",57,7,4,8,21,0,14

												Even though the game is pretty repetitive, it is still an amazing experience. Tip: Start with a slower car. That is the best experience. Or even, start with the worst car in the lowest season. See the growth. You will be amazed with yourself.A con would be the pitstops. The risk factor is really crazy, and the time added is like 8-10 seconds. The tires are also something that needs fixing. They write 11-13, 10-12, 9-11, but it really isn't. Decrease one/two laps from the range and that will be more realistic. The harder compunds are even worse. 20-22 lap tires will be finished by 17-18 laps.So, purchase on a discount. You will be amazed. Buy it on normal price, doesn't seem worth it.			",51,1,7,0,5,3,0

												Great game, I'm surprised it's taken so long for something like this to be released. If you like Football Manager style games and love F1 then you will certainly enjoy this.  It is challenging but I have been playing as two teams sat at the bottom (I like the underdog journey) but I'm enjoying seeing my drivers, team and HQ develop.You manage:Drivers (scout, hire, fire, negotiate contracts)Staff (race engineers and designers)HQ (wind tunnels, factory etc)SponsorshipsCar upgrades (performance and reliability are the main stats)You start with Practice and fine tune the car setup based on feedback from the driver.  Then you go into qualifying, again giving another opportunity to setup the car.  Then it is race time where you manage the tyres (ultra softs right through to wet), engine modes, fuel consumption, pit stops, even overtaking to an extent.  The race reminds me a little like the B-Spec races you get in Gran Turismo.Cons:- No official rights mean it has a Pro Evo feel to it rather than FIFA.- There are some annoying little things they have missed like knowing who you are speaking to when negotiating a contract - there are no labels to say it is an Engineer or Designer or Driver you are talking to while in their screen (it's easy to lose track when you are scouting a lot).  I've noticed other little annoyances like that throughout which I hope they solve.- There is also little in the way of tutorial information about what to do.  In the end of season/pre-season gap I frantically started spending a lot of money upgrading parts on my car only to find it was a waste of money.  There was no warning or 'advisor' popping up to say ""We don't need to updgrade our car until the season starts as there will be spec changes"" or anything like that.- The major issue is that there is a cloud sync problem - I sunk 20+ hours into the game while commuting with my MacBook Pro, then started another season on my gaming PC at home.  The PC game (only 1 hour into it) must have synced in the cloud and overwrote my MacBook game meaning I lost 20+ hours and my first game is gone forever!  My advice would be to run 1 save game at a time at least until they publicise they have fixed the problem.10/10 would do that 20+ hours all over again.			",99,7,3,3,2,2,6

												Good game. A fun game about managing a motorsport team that takes you from being a complete novice to a master engineer. Tinker around with your cars, beat the opposition. However, it's not all good. Some points that should be worked on, because they already start to annoy me pretty early on:The opposition runs out of fuel in the last two laps (this occurs to like 1/3 of the drivers), completely changing the results in the last two laps. Bad player AI on takeovers; while my character has a 17/20 for takeover, which is his best stat, the AI just seems to get some sort of bonus on takeovers; during most starts my riders just instantly drop, because for every takeover they do, they are getting taken over twice themselves.Information is not available, or can not be found. For example; during the last race of the season, I had to gain 4 points on the opponents team to advance to the next league. However, during the race I forgot the number, and I couldn't pull up any kind of championship standing. More of these problems exist.However, still a fun game, but it still needs some polishing.

												ok first things first yes its better than the mobile game in many ways:- details in mangement, sponsors, pit stops etc- weather and tire mangement has more to do with the race- larger selection of teams and leagues- upgradable parts which are customizablehowever there are some major flaws that need addressing:- I'm all for having parts having reliablity ratings on parts but having to fix them during a race and cost you time no..big no no in F1 if something was failing like brakes or electronics they'd retire the car only difference between leagues is you don't refule- drives on your team seem dump despite their perks they give up places too easily and they don't tend to fight for positions even on high settings.- costs for parts and expectations seem a little too high though thats my own opinionthere are many more pro's and cons i could go on about but for summarythis game is not 100% there yet they need to fix the flaws and blanace the game then i can give it a better review till then 7.5/10			",54,13,3,7,14,1,14

												So after playing a hefty amount of hours and after playing with the 1.1 patch my advice is buy it!!! I can't stop playing this game, it has its flaws but it's got everything a casual fan and a motor racing fan would need. I'm currently doing the predator challenge and it's so rewarding to be moving up the ladder and within three seasons I was promoted into tier 2.There are flaws though: AI sometimes will make stupid decisions on pit stops, I've won races because they changed to the wrong tire when they should've gone for wets and they put on inters, means they pit again 2 laps later and so the win is in the bag for me.Slow moving cars during practise and qualifying also take the gloss off this game as sometimes it's impossible to do a fast lap because you are blocked, this also happens during the race with backmarkers but I haven't thrown the mouse through the monitor just yet.I'm sure these issues will be cleared up in future patches and I can see me easily clocking 250 hours on this game in the future (maybe more)9/10			",25,10,1,8,48,1,43

												Her tyres are worn out and in the red zone and fuel for a little more than this lap.Yet I push her to squeeze out the last of both tyres and engine to increase the distance with a sec or two.There is a slight chance that she will come out from the pit stop still in the lead, then we will win the race...In my pit stop strategy I instruct the team for ""high speed/high risk"". They have a perk to my advantage.Now I can only wait. She comes into the pit stop, meters starts showing progress, competitors are closing in. Pit stop goes better than planned, she leaves slowly for the exit. Still it is difficult to say, as the competitors are in the the straight now with full speed.She exits just in front of them.I start breathing again.I realize that this is way more exciting than Formula one on TV.Easy to understand, yet good strategyVery visualHigh amusement and excitementThis is the game...

												Played the game for just over 8Hours (this review might change deeper into the game)I jumped in and found this game to be an grate gap in the market as the only real compettitor i can find on steam is trackday manager, this game is 100 times better than its only rival and that comes from the grate depth this game seems to provide, it almost like football manager from when that was good for fans of motorsport, well more specificaly Formular motor sport which isnt nesasraly a negitive but is an are where a future patch or dlc could add some replay ability. as it would nice to have a wider range of diffrent sort of racing to jump into.but with that one only stight negitive out the way all the game has to offer is positive after positve. as i previosly mentioned this game has grate managent depth and by that I mean you make all the key decitions that a team princable would have to make in the real world. this is everything from staffs wages, pit stops to team bases expantion offering, and this offers grate emution into the world of motorsport manager as im 8 hours in and I have only just finished my first season in the europ racing series and all i want to do is play more and more of this amazing game.Along side its depth and solid gameplay it also has some of the nices graphics i have seen from a managment sim and this real lets other games in this area down in my opinion as its all well and good having that depths, the challanging game play and strategy it needs to offer visuals that are nice to look and at and in some ways make there reward of a perfect race weekend seem more rewarding that ugly graphics with good maths. what im trying to say is this game draws you in with the visuals and offers some of the most depth i have seen in a managment game in a few years now.10/10 - Must Play Game.

												I have 40 hours experience in this game and I am very happy to find a game which gives me an opportunity to create, manage and compete with a motor sport team.I am a big fan of Formula 1, thanks to steam workshop, I can find Formula 1 add-on and apply it to the game. I can not find any cons for this game. However, I will write some pluses for you. It is not an expensive game. It is reasonable and affordable price. Graphics... It is a manager-like game but you can watch the entire competition between teams and drivers. It is player based game. That means, you can control everything what you want, e.g. fuel, tires, morals, contracts, buildings, cars, design, etc.I would like to write more things about the game but I am tired to write due to there are a lot of things that should be written.If you like motor sports, you are not going to be regret to play this game.

												So I like F1 and have played other motor sports manager games in the past.This is the best F1 Manager game I have played, but that statement doesnt make this game good.  Overall I enjoyed the game and so far I played 3 seasons.   At first it is very enjoyable, you have 2 drivvers a designer and 2 race engineers that you need to hire/fire and keep employed.  At frist this seems enough.  But it is not long before you think I should have more staff under my control.  There is no real interaction or influce over these people.   After a while of playing the game it does become repetive, and a little frustrating.   For emaple if I have the money why do I have to  upgrade my wind tunnel 1 level at a time.   What F1 team wouldnt build the best they could afford ?  Another anoying feature is in the car setup mode.    There is a slide bar to increase or decrease the downforce, but there is bar that shows the effect of chaning the downforce on the car.  But it slides in the opposite direction than adding or removing the downforce.Also the rules in F1 dont seem to be followed I spent the first 4 races making sure I used two types of tyres.  But when checking on the results I could see drivers use the same tyre type for the whole race.   Maybe I havent clicked or selected an option to keep F1 rules !Overall this game was fun to play at the start,  I did play 2 and half enjoyable season, but after that enjoyment did start to drop of.   Maybe more staff and more interaction with them. Freedom to upgrade  as you want and to what level you want.  If I have the money I want to build the best wind tunnel I can.  (and not upgrade it every year.)If you like a light touch managament game you will like this.  For me it needed a little more depth.  If  you purchase it when it next at 50% off then that a better value.			",19,0,0,1,3,0,6

												I love this game.  If you love F1 racing, and Sim games, this pick this up.  The strategy is great, you can change rules of the series you are in, you can move up and down series, change your livery, improve you team from year to year.  You have the ability to change your race strategy on the fly.  The only two negatives would be no F1 license.  You can change team names and livery with mods, but the tracks are still not real.  Although they are very similar.  A track creator at some point would be great.  The only other issue is (not that it is an issue) is you cant get really close to the action.  A 1st person, view of an overtake, or on track cameras would make it feel more like race day.  It looks like other series are coming, so a NASCAR or Indycar in the future may be possible.  I would recommend this game.  It is right up there with OOTP and Football Manager.   ",20,8,4,26,25,0,21

												Good game, but needs an acceleration button. Really enjoyable, and in some ways quite theraputic, but the 3x speed is just not quite fast enough at times.  If you lose both cars in a race on the first lap (v unlikely btw) you'd be ""forced"" to watch the entire race to be able to progress, and there's something wrong in that being even possible.  Or, if you're comfortably leading then a faster setting would allow to move the game towards the next pitstop window.  Have enjoyed some epic races with cars qualifying 13th and squeezing the last few % of life out of the components and holding off the faster cars with a one-stop strategy.  Perfect mid-tier stuff, in my opening WMC race, so the excitement is there when needed (and no need to speed up at that point).Suggestions (to speed up race e.g. 5x - 10x speed):* unless red line on component reached on a driver* unless car < 3 laps fuel* unless car < 30% tyre* or both cars out of raceIn those scenarios you would (as a user have to) accept that you are able to slow the race down should any qualitive decisions be required (e.g. faster car approaching you or you approaching another).  It reduces the effectiveness of the orders changing rapidly, but moves the game on.Definitely worth playing, but don't feel it's worth the premium price.  Bought on a 50% deal and I don't think it's worth more than that.			",11,9,3,3,5,1,18

												Definitely addictive and fairly deep. Unfortunately, many facets of the game could be improved, and currently not worth the price tag. - Business aspect of the game isn't very deep. 'Marketability' is included in the game and is effected by actions, but there aren't enough actions to tinker with it significantly. What if I built a racing team that makes a TON of money but performs averagely? I'm talking about merchandising, advertising, PR, etc... Not an option. If you don't do well, you're not marketable.- Racing aspect, while deep, can be a bit frustrating at times. Qualifying is almost a nightmare... it's a completely different method of controlling the racer without a tutorial, and is inconsistent. Simulating qualifying will burn through all your tyres [sic]. - Tinkering with the car setup during practice is fun and rewarding. Only a limited amount of time is given, and there isn't a good way to compare both of your drivers' setups and match them up. Also, a team manager is not likely to be making decisions on what gear ratio to choose for a particular track. Or maybe he/she is?- During one of my first races, my #1 was bumped by an opponent on the way to the pit stop, and the collision caused damaged the vehicle. However, during the 15-20 seconds it took for my racer to get back to the pit, there was no way for me to adjust what would happen in the pit stop. So my guy with a broken front wing just rolled up to the pit stop and got his tires changed. That's it. There was no way for me to do anything about it, so I just watched it in misery. (it may have been possible to cancel the pit stop altogether, but since it was an early race, that wasn't an easy option to choose)- I like not always being the winner. A game like this is great for that. Actually makes a good result more rewarding. You'll find yourself rooting for your drivers and team, and will become saddened when they are passed by a superior driver and vehicle almost every time.Overall a good game, but unfortunately not great. I'll be waiting for Motosport Manager 2, or for the sale to drop to 75%			",61,9,2,4,11,1,5

												10/10Only thing i would do to improve the game is adding an option that allows you to create your own team (being able to set the budgets , and other stuff.. and if you wanted to start this process again you'd sell your team). Also , allow regelation for the last team in the 3rd division (european championship) and a random team would join in.. A youth academy for young driveres where you could recruit the best ones (pretty much like fm) would be a good thing to add as well.. To improve the carrer mode for the people who play a lot of seasons , a country without a race track should be allowed to build one. For exemple , lets say that Saudi Arabia decides to build one and then you could vote if you would add it to your calender or not pretty much as you do for normal races.written by a guy that uses my family share to play this game. 10/10 for me as well			",514,147,45,47,47,9,59

The new 2D support is pretty awesome and I hope future patches will improve the game more.I bought it for the full price and it's worth it. There are few parts that can be improved:- Hotkeys can be added to allow more control from keyboard to control tyre/fuel management. - I also hope for more automation with tyre/fuel control as sometimes I go away from screen after starting a race. e.g. Setting if tyre temp is >80% then set mode to conserve.- Add a pitstop strategy management system.My score would be a 9.1/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played a few hours of this game and do thorougly enjoy it. Looks great in 4K although when you are at x3 speed it does make you a bit dizzy as the camera follows one of your cars. It would be better if there was a camera free option so you could view the whole track and what is going on and not just your drivers. The game is really indepth, there are many aspects you take control of I would love to know when you do practice and the race mechanic gives a recommended setup which is represented by a green bar, where in the green bar you should set the seup? If you have ever been into F1 then this is a game for you. Its cheap at the moment too! Enjoy!			",53,2,3,5,8,0,15

												I didn't expect to be this hooked on the game, but it is fantastic! You manage the team on a race-to-race basis, deciding which components to design and upgrade, which team members to hire and fire and so on, which is all done very intuitively. All the while you have to balance the spending on parts with saving up money for new HQ structures, so the strategic part is very well done, it makes you think long and hard about what to do one year or the next. Then you get to the race and micromanage the drivers and managing their strategies.Apart from one bug so far, when the game crashed, I really can't praise the gameplay enough.			",36,3,16,6,7,0,10

Motorsport manager is incredibly in depth, but presented in such a way that it doesnt ever overwhelm you, the graphics are clean, crisp, and pretty, the rain effects are nice (esp when its a full storm and the track floodlights come on)My only real gripes are with the sound (i wish the ambient sounds of a real race track were more prominent (tinny pa systems etc) and the car to pit radio (just doesnt seem right, would prefer a few real voices to add more immersion.I look forward to watching this game develop more and adding many many more hours of play Btw, i wish you could zoom in more on the action!!!!!!

												I had this game and really enjoyed playing it, I had to unfortunetly be refunded though due to it not loading on my laptop.Would strongly recommend the game to anyone interested in exploring different games, this is well made and very enjoyable to any person with a need to play a wide range of game types.I will be purchasing the game again once I figure out how to use and find my voucher, steam seem to hide mail? or atleast after 2 years of being on this, I never worked out how to find mail or mail I have already read.

												While there's still lots of untapped potential (more player feedback, better planning tools e.g. for your budget, more tactical options for your drivers), what's there works an it covers a lot of ground.The fact that races and whole seasons pass pretty fast is a definite bonus, and you can save anytime - great for short bursts of gaming.Really hope to see a sequel which expands on this great foundation.

												I didn't expect to be this hooked on the game, but it is fantastic! You manage the team on a race-to-race basis, deciding which components to design and upgrade, which team members to hire and fire and so on, which is all done very intuitively. All the while you have to balance the spending on parts with saving up money for new HQ structures, so the strategic part is very well done, it makes you think long and hard about what to do one year or the next. Then you get to the race and micromanage the drivers and managing their strategies.Apart from one bug so far, when the game crashed, I really can't praise the gameplay enough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like big engines and the hype of formula 1, formula 3000 and what they all are called, but you also like games like Football Manager.Then this game is one you wanna take a look at.This game doenst have the real player or team names, those names would have added to the realism level.Why the motorsport industri doesnt throw money at this game, is beyond me because it would have been a good advertising oppotunity for them.But in truth it doesnt matter much for the fun level because I really enjoy this game, and it is one of the better games around of its sort definetly worth the money.RATING:My personal rating of this game is 9/10, when you judge it in its category, simply put I really love this game.

												Right lets start: Graphics - GoodUI - AmazingAI - UnbalancedSound - GoodOverall: I feel the company did a good job with the game especially the User Interface and Functions but the AI was severly lacking. This is a key concept element for this game. For this sole reason i can't recommend this game. Maybe if the company spent more time on AI than UI then it could have been good.The game is very interactable, plenty to manage but i find when i race that the AI is unbalanced and hard to beat. It seems to me the only way to beat the AI and get pole is to hire one of the best drivers or Micro Manage every single turn with both your drivers at the same time. It's basicly impossible.

												I really enjoyed my time with it during the free weekend.Pros:+great depth with the car features and everything+the racing feels quite intense at times, i haven't tried the 3d feature but with 2d being really enjoyable i can only imagine 3d would be more the fun+customization features with your racing squad (which sadly leads to a con)+feels realisticCons:-the customisation dlc does not work, maybe it's because of the free weekend, but that was cut off sadly.Overall, I'd highly recommend this game.

												Pros:-Far more depth than the mobile version-Enough character and team interactions to drive your own narrative-Most areas of the game give very good feedback, which is unusal for a simulationCons:-No modding?-Some race events can feel like the cars are on strings, with sudden speed-bursts here and thereWho should buy?Anyone remotely interested in racing will obviously have a close look at this game. I used to be into F1 some 20 years ago, but don't care much about it anymore. This racing team management game is weirdly enough quite fascinating though and I can imagine that fans of any type of management game will enjoy it a lot.Disclaimer:I work in the games industry and happened to get this game for free. I have no affiliation with the makers though. Just thought I'd add a review for this as it is a bit of a hidden gem.			",65,23,3,13,14,0,26

												As you can tell by how many hours I have in such a short space of time (which for me is insane), this is addicting. Partially of course because we have been unsaturated in this topic on PC for a long time with items of high quality, but it doesn't mean I don't love this game. I could spend my entire life saying about the positives, and I could not reccommend this game more, but I want to discuss a few of the negatives so that the devs can hopefully listen and fix these things.The cars feel so big when you are racing against people. You literally can't overtake in so many places against a slower car that it gets incredibly frustrating. And no, not tracks like Singapore and Monaco (hey, please add this track if you could too :) ), but places with massive overtaking areas in cornerish sections in which you go down the inside, but the driver will back out because either they'll touch sidepods with their racing partner or go within 1 metre of a kerb. Dare I say more, than turn 1. Frustrating to say the least, and something I think is just put in for safety of the game to avoid glitches in the earliest release of the game. Ideally I want this to be updated and put in, cheers if you can devs!And the other element of that is, of course, when it goes wrong; crashes, as you may know them. I've done several career seasons on this game, but I've been counting in my latest season in the WMC of which I've done 13 rounds. There has been just 5 retirements, 2 of which mechanical-related. Overall, a healthy kind of number for this IMO should be about 15-20, involving also more times where drivers collide front wings and of course pit for repairs, or stick out and lose a few seconds. And in GP2/3, maybe increase the rate of crashes?That leads me on to another thing that could go on to frustrate me, when I get later on into the careers I've done; are the drivers in lower Formulas and those generated from the scouting facility ever world-class 5 star potential? Or near? Because I'd love a system where you could run 50 odd years into the future and still see the very best breed of talent in amazing drivers. But then again, I'm not even fully into this aspect yet, just speculating on an issue which I think is coming quite present as I get further in.I for one ADORE the concept of a politics system, but woah woah woah, it needs to be calmed down in aspects!Do you really think it's realistic for the WMC to implement grooved tyres for 2017? To implement random grids, into what is basically F1! What I believe would work better, is that completely leaving out tracks for the season should be removed from this, as they have a deal to make with Ernie and only Ernie, not the teams! Track layouts, eh, but for that I believe it should be on who gets higher vote - if a draw, instant NO rather than Ernie's opinion. However, let's bypass those elements because they aren't all too significant. Where the problems come is with MAJOR things, like tyre changes and qualifying etc. These I believe should have strategy-group-style unanimous voting style, where NOONE can be against for it to go through. At least this limits the crazy even if it now makes it basically impossible for it to go through!Pit crews need to be adjusted, because apparently for 40% of Ferrari's pit stops in one season on balanced and balanced only to go at least 5 seconds wrong is justified! Train them maybe, and of course a lot of the better teams would already have high quality in this area.Weather is somewhat debatable; the system now is fun to battle against and always a suprise-throwing-up challenge. But there's still room for improvement.Wet tyres? What wet tyres? (basically, please make more wet tyre running in this game)There are massive fluctuations with the weather, basically being sunny for 20 laps, then raining for 3, then sunny for the next 20. Not every race is in Britain people! If rain comes, normally it should stay for a while at least. Dry tyres should not be fastest when spray is coming off the cars. As soon as about 0.15 wet, we should get off that compound and onto inters. Around 0.4-5 should be the crossover to wets I think.Why don't the wet compounds last at all long? Never understood it lol. Shouldn't they last at LEAST as long as the hardest dry compound available, if not probably longer?A very slight issue I also have (not trying to poke holes, just trying to give every bit of help I can :) ) is when low temp, the hardest compound just freezes and you have to push to make them stay alive, therefore making their life pathetically short. Can we at least reign this quite nice effect in a little?As for raw extra-content, I have no real complaints. Maybe a karting league, where lots of driver talents are grown (hopefully with 5 star potential avaiable now :) ) and you can spend your rookie year(s) of managing there if you so please. And I wouldn't complain about a GP4/FR3.5 league.Oh yes, nearly forgot. Another couple tracks (maybe a dense street track like Monaco) which aren't all used in the current WMC, but can be bought in by Ernie/also used in lower tiers?

												I do recommend the game and from a certain Point of view is a very fun game, sadly there are some major issues with the game, if you ever have the chance to play the game in version 1.21 you will understand what I mean.For those of you that haven't seen that old version of the game, Let me just say that the current version is a half upgraded game, even if you only own the vanilla game, there are stuff from GT everywhere, in other words the company is trying to force you to buy GT.One very fun aspect of this game was the Predator Challenge, and in version 1.21 it was amazing, specially since you could rebuild the team any way you wanted with the free drivers that were out of work, in version 1.23 a version half updated with GT stuff, you do not have free drivers anymore, so you go from having a very tough and very fun predator challenge in 1.21 to an absolute nightmare and an exercise in frustration in 1.23, in other words the company that made the game tried to make the GT DLC obligatory, not giving the option to customers to see the original game if they wanted.For myself I find that 1.21 is 10 times a better game than the current the version, the game is still good, but sadly is not as fun, if I needed to put an score it would be Version 1.21  9 out of 10 (still there are issues with blue flags the game is not perfect)Version 1.23  5 out of 10 (Having a half updated game and trying to force you to buy the GT DLC made the game a whole lot less fun than it was)My recommendation is positive but the game has plenty of concerns.

												Great game for motor sport managing, but still there is a couple of things wrong with it like all others i have played, sponsorships are unrealistic, ie, the cars have different drivers, the drivers are sponsored too in real life but not in this game, and the main thing is the designing, designing should be for applying to the car the next/following year not for the same, and at the end of the year all your effort into creating master pieces just simply vanish and no longer in your store or anywhere, at least some of the pieces could be re-used, so i give it a rating of 6/10. enjoyable until you realise your masterpieces just vanish when they shouldn't and the sponsors need more options, like in real life.

												GreetingsInitial observations are the game has a somewhat steep learning curve. The tutorial,  Walked me through a step by step process of managing my two drivers through a race.  On my computer, I have W10,  and a standard issue Dell Tower that is about a year maybe two years behind the current shelf items and DSL.   The graphics were pretty awesome.  Per the top side view of the cars cobatting ech other.  And ran perfectlyThe tutorial, walks you through the meat of the game which is actually running in a race. You are given the teams you are given in this game. No making up your own race team.BUT, in the career mode, you can opt to JOIN a race team. The first tutorial is the only one I hve witnessed. f there are others, speaking to the techinacl a buisnes side, of the game.  I have yet to see them, and my ba missing the, If you area a racing fan Grognard.  And Old, like me.  This is a must buy.You too can be The Boss.   No actual being in the car, and working it to the limits here. Them days are long gone for me, as I have aged and just want to be The Boss.   And have worn out my thumbs, on my Nintendo controller, and the bunjo cords of my wheels and pedals, When I bought my first computer in 1998. Right now my profile is a guy who won the Worldwide Super Lottery,   And wants to be part of a Open Wheel Racing Team as a hobby. Has no area of significant expertise.  Just and all around knowledge.  Of watching racing on TV/ Initial investigation.  Tier 3 offers up an American Team.  Tier One appers to be Team USA nonexistant  Maybe I need to promote myself int it.  Cool beansWhile I establish a Tier 3 (GP3) race team somewhere in Germany  Under the banner of the Stars & Stripes.  Team Cold War, happeniong. My first job will be to hire some German Engineers.  And learn the metric system.  Euros be damned.  My lottery winnings were US Dollars. Not saying you should buy this game.  How you spend your momney is NONE of my businessSo far,  glad I did. .

												The game is nice as an idea, but like all management games it becomes repetitive season after season. It doesn't use any real world names and racing takes place within a fantasy world of racing.There are many people only playing the game because of mods but the mod workshop is a mess and the guides provided by the Devs are not written in a manner a basic human can get their head around. Also the mod workshop is limited on content as it's dominated by one or two users so don't expect much variation in the mods this game needs to be playable for most people. I also wouldn't buy the game with the idea of modding it, as the devs openly allow workshop content to be stolen and reposted. Ouch!!!The game is 100% a WIP and the devs don't have a clue which direction the game is going in. Evident by the way they are patching.So would I actually recommend the game at this moment. The answer is no for these reasons:It's still a WIP, so why pay full price for a WIP gameThe workshop is a mess and this is a game that relies on its ability to be modded.The Devs are patching and making the game up as they go along. (Again why would you pay full price for such a thing)Small studio making the transition to the next level and don't know how to yet operate on the next level. Still in the learning curve phase. Maybe wait to see their future releases.I'd give the game a miss until the future, unless you get it on discount.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a bargain-bin game in full game costume. Get it on sale only. I'm a longtime sim game player, as well as an avid race fan. I know all angles here. This game is deceptively shallow.Player choice- Or not? The game ensures you have things to do during most races, but these things are pretty arbitrary. Maybe you have a driver whose tire temps are too low for no real reason at all so you have to order them to ""push"" or even ""attack"" to get the tire temps up- why? Shouldn't they just be maintaining the tire temps I ordered in the first place?The game throws a lot of little bits at you like this. Every time you want to add fuel to a car you have to click the plus for every single gallon- the game won't default to a full tank or anything. So when your car comes into the pits you HAVE to click plus for every single gallon to add, or your car would run out of gas. If your brain gets in gear for half a second you realize this is mindless busywork they added- any other game defaults to some reasonable value you can tweak to your preference. To compare this to a real race, in every race series in the real world, teams agree to an ideal schedule before every race just in case the radios go out or who knows what. Maybe we plan on stopping at lap 11 for tires and fuel, then again on lap 22, and on to the finish at lap 33. This game doesn't have that feature, because then you could finish some races without ever having to click any buttons. They had to specifically choose to put some clicks in, just to keep you busy. Once you realize these tricks, the veneer washes away, and you see this is just bargain-bin time-wasting game. Not a bad one, just a cheap one. If they wanted to add in fake clicks, why not have people negotiating sponsor deals in the middle of the race or some other arbitrary stuff? It could be anything.Same goes for the start of every new season. I saved up the absolute maximum budget you can possibly put in for the next season, and my staff are rated #1 in the league. So at the end of the first race of the second season my cars are... in the mid to back of the field, of course. What was the point of struggling all last season to barely get above the middle of the pack on my limited budget, if I'm just going to end up where I started? Yeesh.So this is a fun time wasting game, I'll probably put a solid 50 hours into it before I get totally bored, but it's really just not worth more than sale price.Oh and the graphics? Ha. It has a 2d mode with a pixellated background that look like it could run on a 1990s computer, and a 3d mode that zooms way out on the race to make it seem like there's more going on but in reality this could probably be rendered on a computer from the 2000s. Again, it's all veneer designed to trick you into thinking you're getting more, but if you brain works at all you start to see the holes.			",143,39,27,39,34,1,48

												It's a really nice arcade game. Unfortunately, it lacks depth, which makes it hard to play seriously as you do not have enough stats / tools (& time during the 10m practice) to judge about your setup changes... it's more like a nice looking Ipad-App.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There's no doubt that this game has massive potential. However there are some really annoying problems. The constant failures on cars. I get 2 or 3 engine or gearbox failures per driver each race. A tad unrealistic. The driver who is taking no chances and is engine mode at low is setting faster lap times than the driver who has their engine turned up. The inconsistency of drivers. Finishing on the podium in one race but in the next race is dead last and can't even get close to the next person on the track. Drivers saying their 'tyre deg' is really bad when the condition of the tyres is 98%. But hey, Football Manager still has issues and this is a brilliant starting point.			",6,1,1,0,8,0,2

												It's a very simple game, i was expecting alot more then the phone version of the game, but it's very alike, with better looking graphics, and pretty much the same team management system. the thing that annoyes me the most is the terrible management system, making new parts, improving parts, next year car ""where you just save abit of money all year, then sign all the new contract with suppliers the first day of the new season""hopufully they will change alot next year, if they make another game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												well this review needs to be split into two parts, one for motorsport fans, the other for everyone else.For motorsport fans:Looks: I does the job of pleasing your eyes with nice and detailed graphics and well selected colours, the 3D view is customizable but its got it's limits, you can turn camera around zoom in a bit and zoom out a bit. But what else would you need? well the cars are driving mostly off the natural raceline and that doesn't look good. Behavior of those machines is as strange as possible, sometimes your driver can be outbraked by a car that was miles behind... (more about it later). the looks are alltogether good but I'm worried that they focused the game on console market and you can see it pretty much everywhere.Gameplay: If you are a motorsport fan then dont go anywhere near this game, it's the most anoying thing I've ever tried! The mechanics advice on setup is useless, there's just one practice session to get the setup sorted comepletly from scratch, the drivers are useless whatever level they are. Quali is extra short (If you're lucky you can do 3 timed laps) and you still miss any good setup, then on outlap you have to manage drivers car so by the end of lap his tires and brakes have perfect temp (with two drivers its close to impossible). Ah yeah the setup... well try to skip Practice session and check what they've done to the cars before quali, what a waste... overall the setup screen again looks too simple too much consoley, got simple settings of wing angle, tire pressure, gearbox ratio in ""xx%"" (why??!!), camber and suspension stiffness again in ""xx%"". the drivers dont give any good advice on what they need messages like ""I need more wing"" tell us nothing. The difference between car setups for both drivers sometimes is so different that you start to think ""how the hell can they do same lap times, front wing max, rear wing minimum?!"" and another one ""how the hell this car can drive on that track??!!"". Further on the game is missing choice of racing series, theres just one and some tracks for it nothing else, again too consoley. The race itself is as boring as you could expect from game like that, if you really lucky, you might see some sort of weird looking ""fast paced"" and ""exiting"" ""action"" yeah it won't cause you heart attack. Then its rain prediction, in place of giving any sort of signal that there might be rain soon you need to check the top weather bar to find out, if you dont then well take your driver into pits for new tires, as soon as he stops it will start to rain (and theres no way to swap tires on the fly in pits, only let him go and bring in again). Another thing, the lap times... you got your driver with fresh wet tires, the track is soaking, some other driver got his tires down to 30% and does laps 20 seconds faster then you!! ah and being tactical and trying to cut on pit stops or pushing makes no sense, if parts wont brake down then something else will stop you from advancing... one thing did stand out of this misery, it was the parts development, again not a lot but it actually worked.This game hasn't got much of a proper motorsport manager...For Non motorsport fans:game looks good, got all the fancy graphics you might like and is simple to play, no complicated statistics or telemetry (if you know what it is). It's a simple layback game with a bit of exitement when it all comes to a roll of a dice in quali and race...I'm really dissapointed with this game, had great expectations, was thinking of my strategy for every race, and then after first gameplay it all went down from a very steep slope... Was hoping that SEGA trademark will help it to be at least a good product, but turns out games for fans dont exist anymore, now we have to cope with universal UI for console and PC, forget all what goes into managing a racing team, forget our dreams about it. Five clicks, quick look on useless sliders and off you go.So if youre thinking about buying it, think what you expect from it, and based on that make your decission. Hope you wont be as dissapointed as I am.			",15,6,19,6,7,0,16
