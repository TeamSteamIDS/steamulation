												I started playing this game from a young age I can't even remember and I have always gone back to it, over the years I have seen it improve massively and I'm proud to say that I love this game, it's extremely joyful and entertaining for me and for many others. There are many things I love about this game, but something that is worth a mention is the hugely addictive multiplayer. I have always found the community, even it's changed as I have played, a delight to talk to and play with. I massively recommend this game to honestly anyone. Please pick it up. I beg you!

												iirc this is the game that replaces ""f*** you"" in chat with ""Lets Cuddle""Its pretty simple, but very well made.  You do everything dinosaurs do, including: running, eating and becoming extinct. Its great.Devs sent keys to everyone who bought the game. I think I actually got it on a free day many many years ago and they sent me a key anyway. They are the real heros.Also devs if you're listening, hit us up with some splitscreen and controller support.  That would be great.			",271,37,5,11,13,5,15

~ABOUT THIS GAME~Game type- 2d side scroller* The end is nigh and as a small rapter you do the only thing you know how to, run!* You start by picking your color and a spiffy hat, then it's off to run, duck, & jump for your life.* The sky is falling so run, though other dino's, falling debris, lava, run, run RUN!!* Don't forget to prey on the weak and grab any lesser lizards, birds, worms & eggs.* You can also ride some of the bigger bipedal lizards or get carried by pterodactyls.* Eggs will let you increase your states and the bones will let you buy unlocks.* You win by finding a safe haven from the falling sky.~MY OPINION~Its a really cute game and good for relaxing stupid fun.

												An instant classic, Dino Run is one of my favorite little games. A long time player and it rarely gets old. Has enough modes and difficulty levels to give you a good thrashing when you're running from your demise. Achievements, trophies, and the like are also a great feature, they can be very hard but rewarding in the end. Speed runs are a good way to occupy yourself when you've completed campaign, and do get challenging! Unlike other games, the top level achievemments and hardest difficulty 'insane' are truly difficult. The controls are very simplistic but there's a learning curve to jumping about to keep your speed up. Customization with hats and colours help you trick out your dino. Be a spacedino! A fancy top-hatted one! Up to you! The only issue one may find is multiplayer, while great in its implementation you'll find it a bit deserted. The single player alone should more than enough justify buying this game though! Overall, a fantastic game and I highly recommend this to everyone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												6.4/10 - An Original Runner Still Evading Extinction!There is lots of good stuff happening with this game. It’s a lot more fun than I remember and now there are different modes, customization and more! Multiplayer was added, but I've yet to get anyone to engage in a race due to the lack of player base. It's important to note that this game isn't worth $6; it's nice but doesn't have the juice to keep you hooked. You play as a dinosaur who must escape the apocalypse heading in your direction! Run, Jump, Fly and ride boulders to safety. I completed all the sections on Easy in about 40 minutes, but since the levels are constantly changing you can keep adding difficulty for a newish experience each run. Overall, I'd pay $1-3 based on nostalgia and interest levels. Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more. Free Keys and Reviews weekly!

												One of those kind of games that are simple and easy to pick up for a few minutes of play in between being busy! You pretty much just run from one side of the map to the other, all the while avoiding the impending meteor apocalypse. There are different games modes also that change this, one included that lets you go about casually without needing to worry about death, handy for multiplayer chatting.I played the original often on browser, but I really love the new stuff included in this and the achievements are fun too. You can also customize your dino, and I'm a sucker for customization so +10 points for that in itself.			",198,20,7,14,9,1,1

												Dino run DX is a game where you play as a little dinosaur during the apocalypse running from a giant wall of doom. You eat many things along the way such as, eggs, other little dinos and birds. You catch a ride with pterodactyls or ride giant objects or animals, and get powerups that give you a little boost. If you get destroyed from the wall of doom you lose a life sending you back to the beginning of the level, you have 3 in total. When you lose them all, you become extinct forcing you to restart from the start. There are different levels of dificulty to chose from and the game lets you customise your little dino with different hats and choices of skin colour. You can upgrade your dino after every level to increase his speed, acceleration, strength etc... Its a fun, short game and is fun for mostly younger ages, so i recomend you get a young sibling or cousing to play this as they might enjoy this a lot. I know, i only have 44 mins on this game... on steam.If i am correct, this is the first video game i have ever played. As a kid, i was bored while my parents we're working, so when my dad showed me a website called miniclip with all these cool ""Video games"" i freaked out, hell, i was scared at the idea of a video game. So i went onto the website for the first time, and like every 5 (6? can't remember that well) year old boy, I LOVED THE DINOSAURS. So when i saw the little dino i clicked on it and played. I played this game so much as a kid and when i saw this on steam,  im not gonna lie, i almost cried. For those of you who played this as a kid, on whatever website. Buy this game to support whoever made this and enjoy your own personal trip through memory lane.			",41,7,0,4,9,0,4

												Dino Run or Escape Extinction: The original Dino Run (also titled Escape Extinction) was released on the 30th April, 2008. In that time the game has been played over one hundred million times making it one of the most successful flash games ever developed.The original is still widely available… for FREE!: Although Pixeljam promises that DX has made significant improvements over the original it’s a hard argument to justify purchasing this over playing the original flash games. There’s additional game play options, more levels and more hats in the DX version of the game. Of course, Pixeljam have taken complete advantage of what Steam can provide for players – achievements, full screen mode, Steamworks integration,But what exactly is it? Dino Run bills itself as one of the first ever runner games. It’s certainly the first ever prehistoric runner game. The objective is to take your dino to the end of each level before the dreaded doomsday beats you to it. Once completely engulfed by doom your round is over. However, if you beat it to the end you get to continue. Of course, there are bonuses and traps along the way that will either aide you in your journey or hinder you. At the latter levels these traps can become immediately deadly. In the earlier levels they can still be deadly but you are given a little more leeway than you are later on. One of the best things about the game is that the levels are randomly generated. This avoids the pitfall that games can feel repetitive.Multiplayer: One of the major selling points for Dino Run DX is the addition of multiplayer and the level sharing feature. The latter, especially, gives the game a much needed shot in the arm and extends the potential of the game almost limitlessly. Of course, when you have a daily peak of just 8 players and an all-time peak of 74 you really need to increase that for the title to see the best that it can be.It really boils down to the value proposition: Are you a fan of Dino Run? Then this is a no brainer for you. You’ve likely already got the game or you didn’t know that it was on Steam – in which case hopefully I’ve brought it to your attention. If you haven’t played it before then I suggest you give the free flash version a try and if you like it by all means jump into the game and purchase it off of Steam. The value is there for fans of the game.For similar reviews and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/ ",2243,882,89,270,267,28,370

												This game is just fantasticly simple and enjoyable! I started playing this when I was young and I'm still doing it! As I said, it's simple: just run, as fast as you can, to the right! How hard can that be? Well, it can be really hard. Just try the different difficulties, the speed runs or planet d. Also the exploring aspect is really nice. The maps are randomly generated every time you enter, so you'll fine new locatons every time, and I'm not even talking about the hidden super eggs you have to collect! There's also a multiplayer ability, so if you want to play with friends you can! All in all, this game is amazing! At least that's the opinion of this guy right her! :)			",76,9,5,1,15,0,14

												So this game was originally a browser game from 2008. I used to play it a lot when I was younger, I remember seeing these lobbies full of people from across the globe. I may like this game from nostalgia, but when I take a deeper look at it I think that this game really is a good party game if you will, one to play with friends. This game is also still available in the browser even if it has less functions. As of now the browser version seems to have a bug that doesn't allow new users or guests to join the lobby, but hopefully it won't be that long before it's fixed. If you paid for this game on steam you will get some extra features aswell as being able to play it offline obviously. In online mode there are two lobbies, one for those who bought DX on steam and one lobby where browser users and DX users can play together! Sadly this game's multiplayer isn't very active at all and you'll be lucky if you find a random person to play with, it's really best to play this with friends. The gameplay is fun, chaotic and intense. You are some sort of bipedal raptor like dino that you can dress up in different hats. Your goal is to escape the ever closing wall of doom that heads toward the same goal as you. While you try and get away from your extinction things such as meteors or herds of triceratops will be in your way. You will also learn as you play what the best way to accelerate is and how to maintain your speed. If you eat critters and collect eggs your speed will increase slightly as long as you keep it up, you can also gather power up flowers that give you abilities such as an extended jump, increased speed+/acceleration or one that allows you to destroy large obstacles in your path for a short while. In singleplayer you can also upgrade your dino as you gather points. I don't think I recommend this game for full price, wait until the slightest sale is taking place.Tl;DrVery fun with friends, can be partially f2p, has a semi dead multiplayer. Buy it during a sale.			",146,25,0,5,10,3,8

+ The concept itself is great. You (and all the other dinosaurs) are trying to outrun the meteor explosion that caused them all to go extinct.+ Gameplay is very basic but a lot of fun at the same time. You are a raptor and try to get to the end of the stage before the ever approaching ""wall of doom"" from the meteor impact catches up to you. There are tons of obstacles that get in your way while you race to the end.+ Minimalistic but very creative procedurally generated levels with branching pathways + Many ""hats"" or costumes that pay tribute to a TON of different popular indie games. Super Meat Boy, Shovel Knight, Fez, Bit Trip Runner, Castle Crashers, Battleblock Theatre, VVVVVV, etc.+ Online multiplayer- Fairly short in length / amount of content~ Not many people playing online (I wasn't able to find a game)			",2897,1025,99,264,346,21,391

												This is just VERY similar to the original flash game. I bought it for having achievements to unlock, and that I was willing to pay for a better experience. Unfortunately, very little meaningful gameplay has really been added. If you really like this game, and are willing to pay the $5, I would say go for it. Just know that you aren't getting the most of your money, and won't see a huge amount of improvements. As time progresses, more and more improvements have and will be made.			",14,2,1,0,4,0,4

												This is my first review so I'm gonna keep it simple.Pros:+Huge nostalgia rush if you've played the game before+Huge sense of discovery if you haven't+Charming retro graphics and awesome chiptune soundtrack+No matter what your skill level, there's always a challenge you can attempt+Can provide hours of entertainment for a very cheap price+You can play it for five minutes at a time or five hours at a time+Plenty of secrets to discover+Friendly, approachable developers+Constant updates with loads more content on the way+DINOSAURS WITH HATSCons:-Multiplayer lobbies are usually very inactive-After you've played for a few hours you start getting bored of seeing the same bits of terrain over and over (though they will be adding more terrain chunks in the future)-The sound of the Doom Wall will haunt you in your nightmares-There's a few graphical glitches, and very occasionally you just fall straight through the floor (UPDATE: most of these have now been fixed)IMO this is a fantastic game, and whether you've played the original or not, it's definitely worth buying.

												I love this adorable game. It's simple, it's retro, and it's very fun. You are a dinosaur! You frolic through an idyllic, pixellated Jurrassic landscape! Suddenly, an asteroid hits! Now you must run for your life as a wall of unstoppable doom advances upon you. Dodge other, slower dinos. Eat the occasional worm. Jump over obstacles, duck under wayward pterosaurs, find secret giant dino-eggs, and time your speed boosts well. Will going over that hill, or ducking through the cavern under it be quicker? You only have a split-second to decide! Occasionally you may even want to back-track to discover a secret or grab a nice power-up -- but will you be quick enough to do so and still avoid extinction? There is a multitude of difficulty settings, one-off levels, weird cheat codes, and even multiplayer racing to keep the game very replayable.Also, the music is lovely. It's retro, but in a fun and enjoyable, rather than annoying way. You can even download the soundtrack from within the game, and I enjoyed it enough to do so.I am not usually a fan of running games, but this one is unique and just plain fun enough to get a big thumbs-up for me.

												Did you enjoy the old browser game Dino Run? Dino Run DX is the latest game in the franchise. In Dino Run DX you play as a dinosaur that is trying to avoid extinction. You must keep running in order to avoid the killer cloud of dust that is approaching quickly. Gameplay mostly involves continuing to run right and jump over obstacles in your way. While running you want to collect eggs and eat less fortunate creatures that are also trying to escape. These eggs and creatures are used to unlock additional content for the game. I had some fun with Dino Run DX. At first I found the game to be kind of boring but it started to grow on me. Dino Run DX will mostly appeal to people that enjoy runner games. Dino Run DX is not the type of game that I would play for long stretches of time. Despite having procedurally generated levels, the variety in gameplay rarely changes so you pretty much just keep doing the same things in different environments. If you really enjoy runner games I think you should enjoy Dino Run DX and should consider picking it up. Otherwise I would maybe wait for a sale on the game.Note: I received a free review copy from the developer. Read My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com] ",998,413,28,106,105,15,184

												How much can I recommend this?  I suppose it depends on how much you played the original.  Dino Run DX, for all that ""Deluxe"" implies, feels like an exact port of the old flash game.  Glitches, visual bugs and all.  These are things we were happy to put up with when it was free, but to pay money for an edition that doesn't really improve on it at all is disappointing.  More notable is the failure of multiplayer- indeed, it's essentially dead now, and all the ""players"" you'll see there appear to be kids using it as a chatroom.  When I say dead, I mean DEAD, by the way.  I haven't played a single online game yet, and doubt I will.Another negative thing about the game is the bizarre controls.  For some reason, your little dino doesn't control very predictably.  Jump height varies seemingly randomly, and goes off in strange directions, so leaping for tantalizingly placed eggs can be an exercise in frustration.  The result is that simply moving around isn't as fun as it should be.  To be fair, this is a problem with the original game as well, but it's a surprisingly big issue, as it cuts down on the replay value immensely for me.What can I say that's positive?  Well, it's cute, it's charming, it's lovely to look at.  It sounds pretty good, to boot.  The pixel art is a blend of the old and new - the pixelation and limited colors we might associate with old Atari games, but without any of the limitations, like those on sprite count or scrolling.  Dino Run is, well, a modern game in a cute pixel style, but it is important to note that as a 2007 release this game (and the studio that made it, Pixeljam) actually pioneered the style before most other indie titles.  There's a ton of hats to collect, eggs and special eggs to find, and it can be fun.  But it's hard to overlook its shortcomings when you're paying for it.Look, I'm a longtime fan of Pixeljam.  I love their art, music, and their games.  I'd like to see their games come to other platforms (Gamma Bros. on 3DS would be sweet - just sayin').  But I'm not really happy with the state of this Steam release.  I'm happy to have supported one of my favorite studios, but unfortunately this will be finding its way into my ""uninterested"" game folder.			",33,2,0,2,1,0,0

												pretty sure a lot of kids have played this game in their younger years when it was still a web flash game. wasn't one of those kids myself, but dang it i'm in my twenties and i've been having a blast with this game.Dino Run DX has quite a bit more to offer than the web version. more levels, more polish, more gameplay options, and hats! if you haven't played it before, i'd highly reccommend trying out the web version for a taste of the action before buying the Steam version. it's pretty challenging and a heck of a lot of fun, and the devs are constantly working on updating the Steam version with more content and fixes and the like. if you've loved the web version, you'll probably really love the DX version.bit of a tip, though: when you install the game via Steam, make SURE the Steam overlay can be pulled up ingame, otherwise you won't get achievement notifications when getting milestones, and will be unable to unlock them again as steam achievements. the devs were kind enough to help me with this problem (bless u guys), but i figured i'd shoot a warning to people should it occur to them! if the overlay won't pull up, try rebooting your computer and running Dino Run after the reboot. the overlay should pull up after.aside from that, the game's a huge blast and i hope you enjoy it as much as i have. <3			",158,52,2,58,23,4,17

												Dino Run is a simple to play, hard to master, very polished racing-ish game with simple but quite pretty pixel graphics!The game has two modes: single player and multiplayer, and they have some differences.In single player mode, you have 4 difficulties to choose from, which take you through a set of levels trying to race away from the apocalypse and to the safety-cavern at the end of the last level.  You can find secrets and achieve goals to earn DNA (exp), and at the end of a level you can increase your raptor's stats.  Those stats persist between runs, so you can keep strengthening your dino's acceleration, top speed, jumping height, and strength (to move things around) to better succeed at the levels.  You can also collect bones which count as a sort of currency, letting you buy a neat handful of unlocks such as wallpapers and the game's soundtrack.Multiplayer pits you in a race to safety against other raptors.  It plays similarly to single player, but without the stats upgrading.  Instead, you have points you can gain, levels you can increase, which let you host higher-level races which give more points.  You can also unlock hats as you go!I played this game way back in 2008 when it first came out as a humble flash game, and happily bought up the special edition when it came out in 2011. When I heard about the DX release here on Steam the other day by email I was stoked! I had no idea this was coming out! Even better, I handed the devs a receipt of my old SE purchase and I got a free key! So if you bought SE back in the day there's no reason not to email the devs and ask for a key. :3As of this writing the game doesn't seem too different from its old SE release, but I understand that it's getting crowdfunded right now and early in the cycle. The first goal of DX was just to get it onto Steam; we'll be seeing new features and things added in in the comic months from the looks of it! I'd call it a worthy investment - and even as it is now, basically similar to the SE version, it's still as much fun now as it was back then.I've also created a Skype group for furs and furry-friendly people who want to play this game together - the multiplayer mode being quite fun, when you have people to play with! If you've got the game and are furry-friendly, then just drop me a Friend request and/or comment on Steam here asking to join. :3			",451,94,10,48,33,9,43

												Long ago Dino Run existed pretty much as a flash game on a webpage. I played it a bunch and I loved it. Then they released a version you could download called Dino Run SE, and I played it a bunch and I love it. Now it's finally on Steam in the form of Dino Run DX and I am going to play it a bunch and love it.So basically you are a little pixelated dinosaur confronted by the wall of doom approaching your species, so naturally you run. As you run away you devour anything smaller than you, and can even ride on some of the stuff that is bigger on you to get an advantage. Meanwhile you get to dodge lava flows and meteor strikes. It's chaotic and fun. It's simple yet hard. I'd recommend it to anyone.			",209,76,5,38,27,4,62

												Nostalgic review commence.It's been so long since I've played this game that I've forgotten about it all together, but as soon as I saw it on a friend's wishlist,I instantly felt all the memories flowing back.I had so much fun with DinoCity that I felt like I was an actual caveman beating up dinosaurs just for fun.Killing scaly creatures was so satisfying that I even made a game called Dino Run, because I liked Sonic and DinoCity,It was truly amazing for my simple mind, I still can't believe I actually did something with my life.Just kidding, I'm a stupid ♥♥♥♥, I couldn't make anything like this ever.But I did have tons of memories of this game, almost dying from a big black cloud of unknown substance.It truly spooked my idiotic self when I was younger.If you got some extra cash and some coolguys to play this with.Try it out, it's great for those times that you have nothing better to do, like 80% of the games on Steam.

												Don't be fooled by the simplistic graphics and pastel colors - Dino Run DX is a true work of multimedia art.  With some of the most inspired and cohesive storytelling and game design I've seen in years, it should win an award for best music, alone.  It may not take you long to finish the game, but it will be an incredibly intense time.Well worth the money.  Give it a go.			",125,16,3,39,22,0,19

												I have played this amazing game since some of the earlier versions were out on other websites and I have enjoyed every moment of this game! The multiplayer feature gave new depth to it as it allowed you to go head-to-head against other players and show of your swag on the lobbies. On boring days I would spend hours completing challeges and getting trophies. Overall I would recomend this game to anyone who wants to not be extinct.Happy Running!			",53,8,0,4,9,2,1

												This random runner doesn't have anything spectacular to recommend it, but I do always enjoy taking the occassional jaunt through the last days of the dinosaurs. It's got a fun theme, secrets, and hats, and has just enough depth to keep me coming back to it. I maxed out my stats on the original non-Steam version, so now I get to do it all over again.Plus, it's a good game where you get to play a dinosaur, and how many of those are there? Too few.

												Played this game on my browser when I was much younger. Still playing this game. An outstanding indie game, I encourage any fans of retro themed games, dinosaur games, fast paced games, I reccomend this to you. An exellent example that yes, indie devs can actually make kickass games. +Outstanding pixel art+Entertaining, random, crazy gameplay+Now on steam, awesome!+Good for all ages, and skill levels+Not a very hard game to learn, but still requires some level of planning and strategy for things like challenges.+So many other great things! :DAnd if you write a bad reccomendation saying ""Ughhh I can play this game 4 free"" Go home, your drunk. Support this game, buy a copy. It's rather cheap! :DDid I mention it's got HATS? FOR FREE?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!? :O			",92,6,1,12,6,1,4

												For a game that is supposed to be the successor to the Flash game, Dino Run, this game sure doesn't offer much over the original. The controls are ♥♥♥♥ poor, with your dino quite often going the opposite direction or getting stuck in places that it realistically wouldn't. I've found myself buried into the ground a couple times, or phasing through boulders and walls to get through obstacles. The sound track embodies old Atari music in all of the worst ways, with all of the horrible repetitiveness included, and the art style is really the only thing that can be complimented. For something that costs real world money to download and play, it's quite disappointing. Definitely just stick to the old Flash game.			",56,2,1,16,0,0,3

How could I have missed this?This might look ridiculous, but it´s one of the funniest and cutest pixelart games in my opinion. For me, Dino Run DX is also one of the first games I remember playing. My skills have decrased a lot since then, but I am still enjoying this. Of course, this is not a thing you can play for weeks and hundreds of hours, but a run is always fun! 5,99$ is probably a little too much money, but when it´s on sale it´s absolutely worth.THE END			",66,20,1,1,5,0,6

												It's not a bad game per se, but there are some luck-based shenanigans that rubs me off the wrong way; the dino doesn't feel like jumping at times, thus holes are death traps, stegosaurs and triceratops on steeper slopes are very annoying to pass by, and I would be near the goal, and some meteorite from offscreen land on me and I get caught by the doom.There's not much of a learning curve, and it's possible to get some fun in short bursts, although, I'm not really fan of its simplicity and, again, there are quite a lot of moments that kills the fun for me.

												Less than 5 minutes of fun for the whole family. Talk to strangers online!!! No really, talk to them. That's at least 40% of the game. Talk to absolute strangers and beg them to race you, because without them racing you, you can not level up, you can not develope your character further. This game was better in like 2009 when it was just a free browser game with an entire communtiy that was built around vast friendships and acceptance. Except that one pedophile that sexually harrassed like 15 users on Skype and took child pornography images of them via screenshot and forcing them to, ""Impress the head admin"" after picking them up from the chatrooms of your game. Hope you fixed that bug in the game.There is a lot of room for improvement here.Stop beating the dead horse and trying to make money out of something you already destroyed years ago.

												So much advertizing and positive buff I just had to buy it from discount. Was it worth 2€? Unfortunately, not to me. I can understand this game has some ""retro"" value for those who had played the original flash game at early age, but for newcomers, the game has pretty much nothing to offer. Gameplay is very, very simple and it didn't get me addicted at all. I don't mind the poor C64 graphics and music that much since I grew up on that era, but in this game, its too artificial without any lets say, style. Controls are also quite poor and the dino just doesn't jump and move very accurately or responsively. Surely that was the case in C64 era but today, I won't let it slide easily. 15 minutes of gameplay and you have pretty much seen it all. Will I ever return to play this? Maybe, because at least it loads fast and runs in windowed mode as default. It's quick to start and quick to close. Perhaps this is a good game while you are waiting some big file transfer to complete or something but I've played much more addicting and better indie games like, lets say Limbo or Obulis that were definitely worth that 2€.

												the people in this game feel like they should chat instead of playing the game resulting in only being able to race once in 76 minutes. it's just omegle now minus the people trying to get laid. if the devs add a timer for how long you can sit there and waste peoples time before they get kicked then that would be great and i'd buy the game again.

												Sadly one of the weaker pixeljam games. Feels like it should be a free flash game. The only thing you do is hold right and jump at times. A mocking upgrade system fakes the illusion of free choice but if you do not upgrade speed every time, you will just not be fast enough to survive. A little bit fine tuning would really helped the longevity of this game			",1309,271,33,78,64,11,107

												I managed to get 40 minutes of gameplay out of this, and that was with two playthroughs. I only purchased it because of nostalgia from my childhood days of being too poor to play anything but flash games. This is absolutely identical to the flash version, I honestly do not know what they changed. This has randomly generated levels I'm pretty sure (it's hard to tell since you don't really interact with the environment all that much) and the original didn't, but that's a pretty useless feature in a game like this, so whatever. You COULD replay this enough to get your money out of it, but then you'd be a ♥♥♥♥ing crazy person or bored out of your ♥♥♥♥.			",81,13,0,12,11,0,6

 ""Because who DOESN'T like to be a pixelated hat-wearing dinosaur running from his inevitable doom?""-Basically anyone who plays Dino Run DX     Now, I should hope that the reader would find it rather obvious that the above quote is 73.948% falsified for the sake of this review, but alas, no one actually gives much care for any sort of quote or statistic that I could give, so all that aside...     Dino Run DX (and the Dino Run series in general) is a surprisingly beautiful 8-bit, 2D side-scrolling game that has been near and dear to my heart since I first began my fateful escape from the Doom wall around August of 2010, when the game was a free Flash game found on various sites on the internet.  The player controls a customizable velociraptor using the arrow keys or WASD (along with other keys for other various functions) to run away from a Doom wall following behind, all while gathering the eggs, bones, and little critters that you encounter to gain DNA points to later boost your stats.     The dino can be customized with many different skins and hats, with a large surplus of options available immediately.  Want an entirely pink velociraptor with Boba Fett's helmet?  That's 100% possible.  Ever fantazise about being a pixelated Optimus Prime dinosaur?  Wait no longer!  Or, how about a blue dino with a dot on its back wearing a top hat?  Perfectly acceptable.  With over 38,000 different combinations of hats and skins from the get-go, you CAN'T go wrong!     Besides the given Challenge mode, there are a few other game modes to choose from, as well as a multiplayer mode, each with a unique style of gameplay and insanity that is survival of the apocalypse.  (Due to my lack of experience regarding these modes, I will not comment on them just yet, but I may edit this review at a later date once I do)     Overall, even without a gripping story, Dino Run DX is a very enjoyable game with simple yet compelling gameplay, yet filled to the brim with intense challenges, wacky achievements, hidden gems, and secret areas that will have you coming back for more.  Its 8-bit graphics and retro-style music give the impression of a classic- a title Dino Run DX fits into quite well.

												This is a great little nugget of arcade-y fun I got as a gift last year. And of the smaller games in my library, this is the one that I keep coming back to. The mechanics are simple, quick to pick up, and hard to put down. The challenge level is mostly fair, and the ease of trying again immediately is an excellent touch. The visuals are appealing; the sounds and music really add to the feel of the game as well. Plus, friggin' dinosaurs! And not generic JP monster ones, either. Kudos!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

All bringing improvements and additions while maintaing the classic same core game. Easy to pick up, each level takes less than a few minutes and can be something fun to breaze through. Some challenges and higher difficulty end-levels can give you a run for your money though, even with a fully upgraded dino! A simple game, but plenty of features to keep things interesting for a while. Well worth the price, sale or not.			",117,19,1,3,19,2,7

												It's been a long, long time since I played the origninal on newgrounds years ago. Yet it still holds the same addictive charm for me today as it did back then. You're a dinosaur the world is endingoutrun the end of the world win the game and party It's not quite an endless runner, in the sense that you finish most levels within a minute or so. But the levels themselves can randomize and switch up (and there's 2 other campaigns to run other than the classic) so there's still variety to enjoy.I don't think I'd really go out of my way to recommend the game as anything super-fantastic, but it's certainly a fun little game and worth some of your time and nostalgia.

I was expecting the ability to play the normal campaign levels in multiplayer, together. The only multiplayer levels there are, however, are race levels (where two or more players race to the finish of a pretty short level). I was expecting a co-op survival type of thing, but I guess the racing will do.			",123,15,6,13,17,0,20

The game of my people that will never go extinct!The Game:Dino Run DX.....The game avoiding doom itself. Hahahaha no, I'm just kidding. Me and my brother played this game when we were between the ages of six and nine. It was so long ago I don't remember which one it is. What I do remember though, is my love for this game. Every so often we'd find this game again. Guess what? I found this game AGAIN XD! It's better than ever! New hats, new levels, new dinosaur skins, newish UI and System, and new dinosa- players, I mean players. All new stuff and updates! You get to play a velociraptor and try to escape extinction. There are other dinosaurs trying to escape and live as well. Not only will they get in your way, but bolders, meteors, and lizards raining from the sky will try to stop you from being extinct!It's literally a race against time, the Cretaceous time (era). You can even play against other dinosa- players in Multiplayer mode! Now you can all have a race to see who will escape extinction and who will most likely be dug up later as fossils. You can even chat with those players and maybe, just maybe, even with the devs! It happens every so often so keep your claws- eyes out. It may not be a complex game or anything like that, but it's a fun arcade game that I will play and pass down to generations after me.I rate this game 10/10. ",16,23,0,1,5,0,0

												I remembered playing Dino Run when it was a flash game on Newgrounds, so when I saw the deluxe Steam edition on https://chrono.gg/ for cheap I had to pick up a copy for old time's sake.Dino Run DX is every bit as fun, silly, and frustrating as I remember. The mechanics are simple: run from one end of a chaotic obstacle course to the other, avoiding the wall of imminent death chasing you down. Along the way there are secrets to find (if you have the time and the skill), pickups and little critters to devour to improve your dino (and for achievements), and challenges and speedruns to complete on several different difficulties (for kicks). And before I go any further, there are hats. If you play Team Fortress 2, Dino Run DX is right up your alley.The speedruns aren't that bad on higher difficulties (except for Nobody Likes You). For the most part, they're just longer. If you can pick up the gameplay fast enough there's no reason to do the lower-difficulty runs if you're after the achievements, since completing on Hard or Insane will also count as a completion on Medium.Speaking of achievements, Dino Run DX has some bugs related to the them and to the leaderboards. Like others I was unable to get the Bronzed and Silverado achievements unlocked until I got all the gold trophies for the Goldie achievement. I was also able to get the Easter Bunny achievement without finding all the large eggs just by grabbing the Bronto Egg in Beyond Apocalypse. Lastly, I had a similar problem to this user during one run, and an instance where I fell through the world and was able to make an insane time on another. Between these two buggy runs I was able to boost myself to #20 on the overall leaderboard, which I don't actually deserve.There were a few times when I managed to glitch my way into walls and couldn't escape, destroying an otherwise perfect run, but with the exception of weird world geometry there are very few problems with the gameplay. If it's cheap, why not? Even 100% completed Dino Run DX is a great time waster.			",143,26,3,17,12,0,12

												So much flippin' worth it. I've known this game since it was only in browser version, then bought the SE version when it came out... and then, a couple of years later, i think that it's been a long time since i've last heard of this game, and i go check out again, and guess what i see : BOOM, Dino Run DX. ON SALE, more than that. I buy it (almost no hesitation), play it : turned out bringing me a great taste of childhood nostalgia plus the excitment of an improved version of a game that was already fun and addictive back when it was just a browser game.So yeah, REALLY worth the cost ! It's fun, addictive, it has multiplayer, simple yet beautiful retro graphics, and enough challenges and content to last a good while (and HATS. FREE HATS). Tem at a tem, would totally recommend.

												Great Game! This game has colorful graphics, awesome style options, multiplayer and more awesome things! I love to customize my own dino. Customizing your own dino can get VERY Complex, you have a Variety Of options. Theres Even a Minecraft and Fnaf Head You Can Wear! if you havent played this game yet i reccomend going here to play the free version first to give you a idea of what its like, http://www.miniclip.com/games/dino-run/en/     Keep in mind thats the FREE version and it doesnt have as many things as the STEAM VERSION. so it may seem like, Hey free game online why not but the Steam Version is better trust me.Also dont think multiplayer is a HUGE AWESOME THING cus i have bad news, its not. The Multiplayer in this game isnt amazing but it is ok. it is very well setup the problem is that half the time no one is even on. This means you cant even race someone which can be very frustrating.

												Firstly, if you want to skip most of the boring information just skip to the bottom, but if not then read on.This game was my childhood.  I used to play it all the time, got all the achievements, found all the secrets, completed everything on insane, and reached rank 8 in multiplayer.  Needless to say, I spent a lot of time playing this game and it was well worth it.  In terms of gameplay, this game has 4 difficulties (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Insane) across 4 different play modes (Challenge, Speedrun, Planet X, and Multiplayer) currently since once they reach fundrasing goals they will add new stuff).  Oh yeah, and there are also a lot of achievements and secret dino eggs, endings, etc.  I costomed my dino to have the samurai hat with the white body and red eyes back in the SE version, and that's what I'm working towards in this version as well :D  In order to sum up everything:BEST HAT SIMULATOR 2015 10/10			",58,7,0,8,5,1,10

The game of my people that will never go extinct!The Game:Dino Run DX.....The game avoiding doom itself. Hahahaha no, I'm just kidding. Me and my brother played this game when we were between the ages of six and nine. It was so long ago I don't remember which one it is. What I do remember though, is my love for this game. Every so often we'd find this game again. Guess what? I found this game AGAIN XD! It's better than ever! New hats, new levels, new dinosaur skins, newish UI and System, and new dinosa- players, I mean players. All new stuff and updates! You get to play a velociraptor and try to escape extinction. There are other dinosaurs trying to escape and live as well. Not only will they get in your way, but bolders, meteors, and lizards raining from the sky will try to stop you from being extinct!It's literally a race against time, the Cretaceous time (era). You can even play against other dinosa- players in Multiplayer mode! Now you can all have a race to see who will escape extinction and who will most likely be dug up later as fossils. You can even chat with those players and maybe, just maybe, even with the devs! It happens every so often so keep your claws- eyes out. It may not be a complex game or anything like that, but it's a fun arcade game that I will play and pass down to generations after me.I rate this game 10/10. ",16,23,0,1,5,0,0

												Six bucks is a bit hefty for a small little flash game like this, and truth be told, I think a lot of my personal bias goes towards this game since I have incredibly fond memories of this game as a 5th-7th grader playing it.  A decade later and in several years into college, it brought a smile to my face to play it once more with the fantastic soundtrack and clunky mechanics, same as before.  Bringing back old memories like that alone is well worth the cost for me.  I will say however it does convey the frantic run away from the wall of doom very well, more so than most games I've played.  However, if you haven't played this before, there's truthfully not much going for it.  It's a simple, straightforward runner game that's probably worth the dosh below the price listed currently.  Still, you can tell the game has a lot of heart.  The cute animations, the simplistic yet effective mechanics, and in my opinion, a pretty amazing soundtrack despite how small it is.  It was original and punchy.  Loved it.			",66,7,2,14,7,0,4

												I've been playing this since it first released back on Miniclip in '08 and it's been interesting to watch it evolve as the players grew up with it. Both the game and company have been through a lot of growing to reach where they are now and the latest iteration (DX) is the culmination of every lesson learned along that path. With some old bugs squashed, new features implemented, and hats crammed into every nook and cranny you can find, it's no wonder that the game provides hours of entertainment to players of all ages. What really puts it over the top, though, is the responsiveness and involvement in the community by the developers that you just don't see often enough.Small disclaimer that I received the game for free due to doing mounds of beta testing over the years.

You can't really make a successful sequel to an endless runner without ruining it. I've had 15 hours of play in the last 2 days, so that sort of shows how much of a nerd I am. This new desktop version has an improved speedrun mode, with seeds, and there really isn't a need for cheats when you can enable and disable them on the fly in freerun mode.

I wish there was proper controller support, though, so you could control the whole game from the controller instead of just your dinos - enabale it for the menus and such.

												I remembered playing Dino Run when it was a flash game on Newgrounds, so when I saw the deluxe Steam edition on https://chrono.gg/ for cheap I had to pick up a copy for old time's sake.Dino Run DX is every bit as fun, silly, and frustrating as I remember. The mechanics are simple: run from one end of a chaotic obstacle course to the other, avoiding the wall of imminent death chasing you down. Along the way there are secrets to find (if you have the time and the skill), pickups and little critters to devour to improve your dino (and for achievements), and challenges and speedruns to complete on several different difficulties (for kicks). And before I go any further, there are hats. If you play Team Fortress 2, Dino Run DX is right up your alley.The speedruns aren't that bad on higher difficulties (except for Nobody Likes You). For the most part, they're just longer. If you can pick up the gameplay fast enough there's no reason to do the lower-difficulty runs if you're after the achievements, since completing on Hard or Insane will also count as a completion on Medium.Speaking of achievements, Dino Run DX has some bugs related to the them and to the leaderboards. Like others I was unable to get the Bronzed and Silverado achievements unlocked until I got all the gold trophies for the Goldie achievement. I was also able to get the Easter Bunny achievement without finding all the large eggs just by grabbing the Bronto Egg in Beyond Apocalypse. Lastly, I had a similar problem to this user during one run, and an instance where I fell through the world and was able to make an insane time on another. Between these two buggy runs I was able to boost myself to #20 on the overall leaderboard, which I don't actually deserve.There were a few times when I managed to glitch my way into walls and couldn't escape, destroying an otherwise perfect run, but with the exception of weird world geometry there are very few problems with the gameplay. If it's cheap, why not? Even 100% completed Dino Run DX is a great time waster.			",143,26,3,17,12,0,12

												Six bucks is a bit hefty for a small little flash game like this, and truth be told, I think a lot of my personal bias goes towards this game since I have incredibly fond memories of this game as a 5th-7th grader playing it.  A decade later and in several years into college, it brought a smile to my face to play it once more with the fantastic soundtrack and clunky mechanics, same as before.  Bringing back old memories like that alone is well worth the cost for me.  I will say however it does convey the frantic run away from the wall of doom very well, more so than most games I've played.  However, if you haven't played this before, there's truthfully not much going for it.  It's a simple, straightforward runner game that's probably worth the dosh below the price listed currently.  Still, you can tell the game has a lot of heart.  The cute animations, the simplistic yet effective mechanics, and in my opinion, a pretty amazing soundtrack despite how small it is.  It was original and punchy.  Loved it.			",66,7,2,14,7,0,4

ONE-DINO DOVEBURGER APOCALYPSELong story short there was Dino Run SE for a long time, and the devs started a Dino Run 2 KS, but it fell through, so instead of trying another large-scale (heheh) project like that, they started upgrading the HECK out of the original. Same engine, same experience, new stuff to play with.Although the ""upgrading"" of the internal Flash Player (ye it's FL-based) has caused automatic anti-alliasing and problems on certain machines, but I blame Adobe for that ♥♥♥♥. Hopefully they can iron out every last one of Adobe's ""features"" to bring back the old experience with new stuff. Sadly it's also the same fate as a lot of classic Flash games and vids. As relentless as PixelJam is, it's doubtful that these issues will remain indefinitely.""Wait, where's your actual review?""If you haven't played this game I don't know what you're doing with your life. You can play the old free versions on their site, MiniClip, Kongregate, NG, etc. It is Flash-based after all....Fine. A short rundown: It's a fun game despite its somewhat unrealistic physics (but it makes for hilarious results if you can wurk it). The skills you need to beat the insane classic challenge run will make the whole of the game quite enjoable if you dig these kinds of games. It's not casual, but it's not hardcore either, which is pretty refreshing and gives it a lot of replay value, kind of like Ori and the Blind Forest. Yes, I went there.The game's soundtrack has a subtle and proper blend of DnB, Doom Metal guitars, and Tribal elements. Not a lot to hear, but it's a small game. I hope to see it expanded in the future. Apparently the Halloween Hellrun comes with it's very-own soundtrack. Can't wait to get some files of it, too.			",126,9,1,2,7,1,9

												Simple, yet entertaining and kid friendly game!In comparison to their new game release ""Last Horizon"", there are a lot of similarities: - noticably little content (more on that later - there is content, and it is being expanded in this game)- simple yet challenging game mechanics- few stages to get throughBut Dino Run DX features more: - hats, lots of them- customizable dinos (color only for now)- online multiplayer, although very laggy for me (might have to do with the poor engine performance on slower computers - they are on it to find a fix I was told)- still in active development as long as funds pour in, so it can only get better- dinosaurs are awesome!So my overall judgement is a recommendation, as opposed to Last Horizon, as of today (shortly after launch of LH).

												I never thought a game about running from the apocolypse could be so therapeutic. Dinorun is a must have for anyone who enjoys oldschool arcadey, pixelated games, and with the quickly growing multiplayer, and all sorts of different maps to run, it's certainly worth the price tag.

												I remember when this was just a flash game! It's everything I remember and more. Pixel graphics never go out of style, but the music is one of the best parts of this game. It has a very Hotline Miami vibe, but with more of a prehistoric tone.Plenty of levels, speedruns, and collectibles gives this game lots of replay value, but the multiplayer is dead.I was really looking forward to racing around the apocalypse with other people, that would have made this game so much better, but there's no one in the lobbies! Oh well, I'll just settle for doing every speedrun on Insane difficulty.			",24,26,1,23,10,0,12

												I remember playing this on one of my flash games websites a lot when I was a younger boy. I'm 17 now and I thought it would be fair to support the developers for all the fun they gave me back then, and to take a trip down memory lane and have a little more fun. :)Basically, this is a VERY well-made game where you play as a little dino trying to escape the doomsday event caused by the meteor that is theorized to have wiped out the dinosaurs. The pixel art is very well made and believeable, the sounds and music are great, and some cool and crazy things happen in the environment as your little Dino runs. I'd say if you like the look of it, pick it up.			",91,4,2,2,12,0,0

												Ah, memories... Iused to play this game all the time when 4kids used to have website (wow, I feel old now!). But its pretty basic run to the right to avoid a pyroclastic death and save dino eggs. The game is really fun, and there are times where the game will slow if there are too many meteors and dinos on screen.The only bad thing that comes to mind about this game is the 'insane' difficulty setting. *Easy: Short of sitting there for three minutes you're not going to die.*Medium: Same as easy*Hard: You can get stopped my dinos or hazards at least three to five times dependin on level before the death cloud is on you.*Insane: You get one to two mistakes per level until the death cloud overtakes you in seconds.Otherwise this is a fun little game that's great if you want to unwind after a long day.

The game of my people that will never go extinct!The Game:Dino Run DX.....The game avoiding doom itself. Hahahaha no, I'm just kidding. Me and my brother played this game when we were between the ages of six and nine. It was so long ago I don't remember which one it is. What I do remember though, is my love for this game. Every so often we'd find this game again. Guess what? I found this game AGAIN XD! It's better than ever! New hats, new levels, new dinosaur skins, newish UI and System, and new dinosa- players, I mean players. All new stuff and updates! You get to play a velociraptor and try to escape extinction. There are other dinosaurs trying to escape and live as well. Not only will they get in your way, but bolders, meteors, and lizards raining from the sky will try to stop you from being extinct!It's literally a race against time, the Cretaceous time (era). You can even play against other dinosa- players in Multiplayer mode! Now you can all have a race to see who will escape extinction and who will most likely be dug up later as fossils. You can even chat with those players and maybe, just maybe, even with the devs! It happens every so often so keep your claws- eyes out. It may not be a complex game or anything like that, but it's a fun arcade game that I will play and pass down to generations after me.I rate this game 10/10. ",16,23,0,1,5,0,0

												I have been playing this game for years now, and it still has the same charm. I've played the original online version, the SE version, and of course the DX version. All bringing improvements and additions while maintaing the classic same core game. Easy to pick up, each level takes less than a few minutes and can be something fun to breaze through. Some challenges and higher difficulty end-levels can give you a run for your money though, even with a fully upgraded dino! A simple game, but plenty of features to keep things interesting for a while. Well worth the price, sale or not.			",117,19,1,3,19,2,7

												Great Game! This game has colorful graphics, awesome style options, multiplayer and more awesome things! I love to customize my own dino. Customizing your own dino can get VERY Complex, you have a Variety Of options. Theres Even a Minecraft and Fnaf Head You Can Wear! if you havent played this game yet i reccomend going here to play the free version first to give you a idea of what its like, http://www.miniclip.com/games/dino-run/en/     Keep in mind thats the FREE version and it doesnt have as many things as the STEAM VERSION. so it may seem like, Hey free game online why not but the Steam Version is better trust me.Also dont think multiplayer is a HUGE AWESOME THING cus i have bad news, its not. The Multiplayer in this game isnt amazing but it is ok. it is very well setup the problem is that half the time no one is even on. This means you cant even race someone which can be very frustrating. But over all Great Game Good Cost!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
