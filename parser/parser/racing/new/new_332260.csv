												Better then the first game, and the best pc version of any Cars.  Lets get to the good. It runs at 60fps(unlike the orginal), and it features much higher quality textures. The racing is fun and the open hub world is great to have. This is like an expansion on the first game that makes the original almost useless. Then there is modding, but I will get to that. That gets me to the problems that do not make sense... First it does not support 1080p(The 1st did) on my screen, however my laptop runs at 1080 fine,and the 360 rotation is terribly touchy. As for the graphics options there are not any really. Typical Disney port. Though you would really need a paper weight to struggle running this. Then theres a little known glitch where if you're running it off of fast HDD hybrid(32+GB cache) the sound will glitch and the game will freeze for a half second to catch up. So run this off of a slower hybird, normal HDD, or SSD. I am running it on an SSD and it runs great. On top of that Chick Hicks is gone, among others from the movie like DJ and King. That gets me to best thing about this game.  A mod called High Octaine. It puts all the big characters in this and adds many new tracks. You can pick Snot Rod, Cartrip, Wingo, Lizzy,and Fred. Freaking Fred! And many more. It even adds McQueen and Matrer from Matters Tall Tales as well as Mia and Tia wearing different costumes from Tall Tales. I have yet to get a crash and everythings buttery smooth even though it is not widescreen. If you go to your graphic control pannel you can increase and enhance everything; so don't be afraid of messing around with things like texture qulity and set AF x16. Like wise Sweet Fx works great enhancing the draw distance, lighting and colors. Go to Nexus and download Sweet Fx mod for Assassins Creed Rouge and drop it in with the exe. Its a great preset and doesn't require any tweeking if you don't want to. With all that in place it is the most visually impressive Cars game anywhere with the most content. If your kids like Cars, then this is the version to get on PC hands down. None of the mods take much work and the game runs very well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good game, but not perfect. For example, the game likes to crash for random periods, and the longest I've gone without crashing is 20 minutes.  Then again, it might just be my computer.  Now, for the review:Story: Think the first Cars Game, then mix it with the aftermath of Cars 2.Hub: Ripped from the first game, with the additon of a redesigned O.VControls: I suggest a gamepad for playing this.Graphics: Very Good, but odd.  For example: High Poly models, but low reseloution textures.Music: Also from the first game.  That menu music is still ""driving"" me crazy.  Some songs are from the film, such as ""Life Is A Highway.""Score: 8/10Great for the kids, or for teenagers and adults looking for a nostaglia trip.  Just don't expect to get very far using modern systems and keyboard controls.  But that is just my opinon.			",46,10,5,2,4,0,0

												This game is good as i remember.The gameplay is kinda the same from the first game but a bit different.Sally doesnt make an apeearence in this game,WTF Disney.In arcade you can race also with Sarge, Fillmore and Luigi but no Sheriff to race with it?Mater is holding an interrnational championship wich i think this was the idea for Cars 2 but this one is way better than the Cars 2 movie and the game.We have Otto from Germany,Emma from England,Giovanni from Italy wich in my opinion it was WAY better than Francesco in Cars 2 because Francesco is bassically Lightning in the first movie before staying at Radiator Springs and Gudmund from Sweeden.Also there is a lot of minigames unlike the first one.Lightning is not voiced by Owen Wilson in this game.A good think i like is when in air you turn to drive backwards and viceversa but unfortunaley backwards doesnt give you points like in the first game.Also i dont know why dont dont added achievements like they put it for Xbox 360 and PS3.Also a secret you can drive in freeroam with Lightning as MONSTER TRUCK,also you can race with Monster Mater,speaking of freeroaming there is no music on background like in first game or Race O Rama except when you are close to an event wich make freeroaming in this game boring also you cant go to canyons like in first game and in the right part when you are almost out of RS you can drive there either wich makes freeroaming boring in this game  in my opinion.Final note:9.5/10			",205,33,16,6,21,1,9

												I don't know why people like this game more then the Original Game!I mean yeah, better graphics, better preformance that's nice and all but1st, the creators of this game took so much free roam away! Radiator springs? You can only go down the middle of town. Go around the Radiator Cap and that's about it.  Tailfin pass? You can't even go up Tailfin Pass! You can only go in the short area around the Hotel.  Ornament Valley? It's almost not the same at all from the original. Yes, it has 4 new areas, but you can't even go through 2 of them! Plus, there is this strange new area next to the enterence of Ornament Valley. Of course, it's blocked off. The only thing you can do is to do the races and Minigames! There are next to no jumps or any secret areas at all! But with the original Cars the Video Game, the free roam map is huge! There are even areas you would never think you could go to that you could in the original game! But not in Mater National. Plus, Mater National has about 6 new characters. The original on the other hand, has 10 Brand new Characters! Plus it has alot more tracks, and playable characters.			",60,5,4,1,6,0,1

												what if your car came to life and it could drive a car (itself) in a race with you still inside? and you could never get out, never escape the car, the car has replaced you and will never need your help again. 0/10			",565,260,11,121,74,5,145
