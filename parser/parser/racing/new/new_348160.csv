								Very fun game if you have more then 2 players for deathmatch mode. Even though 1v1 can be fun aswel but pretty much require both ""skilled"" players in terms of movement and aiming. I'm playing with my wife RACE mods, it's fun, pretty challenging once when we both learn maps so only second or two is deciding winner.Other then that it's obvious that game is in early stage where many bugs occurs, multiplayer is not that ""alive"" so I couldn't find even one server to play alone.I wish that there are more maps in RACE mode, perhaps leaderboard and ghost for trial runs so solo players can challenge theirself including fighting for leaderboards since there are many shortcuts in some maps. RNG box's to collect and get power-ups is always fun for me since I'm enormous fan of Crash Team Racing and even though it's fast running instead driving it's cool (keep on mind I'm not even considering to compare those titles).All in all if you have atleast one or even more friends to play with, solid fun. Hopefully they add more content.			",217,47,4,24,23,4,17

								Very nice jump n run, with a very unique sense of humor, which completly fits mine. Graphically it isn't the best, but that is definetly not the point of this game. In SP, it's a fun game early on, trying to make the jumps and find some coins, until you reach the end of the level the first time. That's when you realize what the possible time for the map is as you see the scoreboard for the first time, and you either quit because you're frustrated, or you spend your entire weekend getting that one tenth of a second to get faster and faster again, find a better route, find other jumps you can use or abuse, and so on. This game is incerdibly easy to start, but has one of the highest skill ceilings of any game i came across for quite some time. And in MP, it sadly becomes more of a speedrunner-clone, with some unique ideas, like the skybeam of death, but still.. It certainly is fun, especially playing the game with some mates with voicechatbut it can also be incredibly frustrating, when you get hooked and stopped through some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t from first to last. As of right now, playing with premates is sadly the only way to play the game in MP, as you can't rely on finding a game online.There are even some possibilities to make your rumpy unique with some fairly special hats, capes, and t-shirts. i would certainly recommend a buy here, especially for this price. And there is more than enough content to keep you playing for some hours, even if you just rush through the levels, without wanting to actually get a top tier time on them.			",112,10,0,14,18,1,12

								I can see that the developers have put a lot of effort into this. It is good to see such detailed maps. Personally, the single player is not really my game, but the mulitplayers looks very interessting.And lets be honest here, love the fact that I can jump without arms and legs :D The abs these toons must have!
