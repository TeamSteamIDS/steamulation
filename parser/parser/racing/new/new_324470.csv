Early Access Review
								Disclaimer: My original review was negative for reasons that will be fixed soon, this was the review.""Seems pretty good but currently it's way too slippery for me, the controls just don't feel tight and I cannot get use to it for the life of me.""Short, but to the point. Not a few days after, the developer of this game ""Princesseuh"" contacted me, stating that my review was probably the only constructive negative review at the time. We talked for a bit about the game and what could be done to help, it, it's future and such. Let me state, the developer is a very kind guy, and this game is a very good game, I probably wouldn't have bought it if it hadn't intrigued me on first sight. The fact that he reached out to me personally should show he really does care about this game. The only reason I didn't like the game was because the controls felt a small bit slippery to me personally, but I've gotten word that that has been fixed, and I will definetely be rebuying it asap. If you enjoy games that are well made and made passionately (Or just good 3D platformers, like me) Then you should buy this, especially with the astronomically cheap price tag. Support this developer, he's one of the good ones.EDIT: My old review got some heavy downvotes, I'm guessing it's because the community really loves the game, so take that into account.

								Ever played Bhop? Surf? If so this games mechanics will feel Instantly similar too you. This game gives you such a rush jumping around at these amazing speeds. I cant really explain it, its the kind of thing you just need to experience. With multiple diffrent ways to finish each course it gives the game a competitive feel. You'll be trying to shave off those extra seconds to try and reach the top of the leaderboards on your favorite course. Visualy this game is stunning while the graphics are very minimalistic it is one of few examples of minimalism done very well in a game. The meticulous design of the levels leads to a mechanical and visual masterpiece. Not only will your eyes love this game but your ears will as well, the music is absolutely magnificent, even while failing a course over and over the music will keep you calm and mellow. I'm not usually a fan of Early Access but the game is so cheap and the devs seem to be very nice so far so I'm glad to support it in such a early state. If you have a few dollars sitting in your steam account I fully recommend getting this game.			",307,42,11,41,21,1,20

								This is the kind of game you could either play to beat some challenges and highscores, or when you just want to relax after a long day. The calming atmosphere really makes it satisfying to play, even when you keep restarting that level to win. The minimalistic look and the soothing music combine and let you in a very peaceful mood.Like it's been said before, SinaRun is easy to play, hard to master.I am personnally not really good at video games in general. I don't really play that often, even if I love the art of video games. Some would call me a ""casual player"", and still this is one of those few games that I really enjoy playing, from time to time.You can either play half an hour a day or for three hours straight, you can choose how much time you spend here.Maybe you're scared of that ""Early Access"" thing, but I guarantee you the developper actually listens to feedbacks and is always looking for improvements. You can tell he's doing it out of passion.			",42,15,5,2,6,0,3

								A really stylish, pared-down bunnyhopping/parkour game. SinaRun reduces the complex mechanics of bhopping/surf mods to the bare essentials without sacrificing the sense of speed and difficulty. This one is more focused on intense, high speed runs with multiple lines than technical parkour obstacle courses. Although your speed is easily maxed out with the benefit of a sprint key, the game uses a unique timed-jump mechanic (length of press controls jump height/distance... kinda like a 3D flappy bird game on speed :P ). This leaves enough fine control to experiment with different lines and keep the skill-cap high enough so you can improve on your records. For this type of game, this is a brilliant compromise because it doesn't sacrifice the speed/flow for the sake of simplicity, and manages to scratch close to the same itch as notorious mods like Quake Defrag and CS surfing without the huge learning curve barrier. Still needs some tuning, bug fixes and more maps but for <3$ it's well worth checking out.			",80,14,3,11,5,2,4

YouTube™ Video: SinaRun Preview (Steam/PC) 

			Views: 125		

			In this video, we show a preview of the upcoming game ‘SinaRun’ for Steam. Video was Recorded and Voiced by The Hidden Levels one and only Manic Ado. SinaRun is a minimalist 3D platform/racing game.		

SinaRun is a racer/platformer in which you run and jump between platforms. I struggled on this and often found myself falling down over and over again. The game has the ""just one more go"" effect which keeps me trying over and over. I enjoyed the level design and colour schemes of the levels. One addition I would love and which would keep me playing the game would be addition of controller support. Positives:+ Low price+ Colours and levels are quite fun.+ Leaderboards for competitive speed running play+ Early Access, so there will be much more to improve on+ Dedicated developerNegatives:- No controller support which would really be beneficial to us non keyboard wielding people- Slight delay or it feels like to me in the jumps.- Frustrating when falling over and overI would recommend this to people who are looking for a fun speed running platformer game. If you enjoy being a ninja this is definitely a game for you. For people who are not used to using the keyboard this may be the game to wait on for controller support if ever added, as mashing my keyboard and failing is not favourable. For the price, I find it's real hard to skip though. I recommend a purchase.			",364,222,25,40,79,2,39

								tl:dr ""hey guys lets make a precision platformer where you slide for fifty feet when you hit the ground""This game is such a piece of dogsh*t. Let's start with presentation. There are typos everywhere, the music is all insufferably saddening with a certain track having literal tapping every few seconds just to anger you, the colors in some levels are awful with an example being a level with bright orange on top of even brighter orange so you can't see anything, and the levels all very much look the same. It is possible to do a minimalist style without looking super similar every stage. The gameplay is pretty bad too. Lets see, it's a first person platformer where you can't see your feet, so you can't judge how to land, you slide really far when you land, the controls are extremely touchy, speed is inconsistent, and there are often tiny gaps that you will fall between that you can't see because of the art style. Fantastic.I have no idea why this game has glowing reviews. It's incredibly poorly designed on all fronts. The thing is, it can be fixed with a few simple patches. Unfortunately, there's no way to see that without playing it. Refund requested.			",231,13,1,13,13,1,7

								A very well made and unique game, and I love the sound track! It's really fun trying to beat your highscore and seeing all the different creative ways to complete a level.It took me a good 30 minutes to an hour to get used to the fast speeds and sliding, but now I can complete levels very close to the time of those on the leaderboard. :DEDIT: and to those who wrote bad reviews about how the game is very slippery and you slide alot, that's just how the game is, and the sliding in my opinion, helps you complete the levels faster. You just need to know when to slow down in mid air and about to land that you don't slide off a platform.			",81,8,2,6,3,0,7

								This game is just...well I didn't like it.  I understand what it's supposed to be: a speedrunning first person platformer, but something about it is just...off.  I think the best way to describe is that it feels like your character has no weight.  It takes a long time to get used to if/when you land on a platform because there's no audio or visual cue that you've landed.  This leads to a lot of frustration as it's hard to learn to gauge jumping and landing,  This wouldn't be a problem if the entire game wasn't centered around jumping onto small platforms at breakneck speed.4/10			",943,422,40,92,124,10,156

								Pixel Perfect: The Game.+Cool Design+Awesome Music+Unique Jump momentum & Gameplay mechanics-Unique Jump momentum & Gameplay mechanics-Frustrating level design-Punishingly hardIf there was a ""I am between yes and no"" choice for the thumbs voting system that would be it. This game as a LOT of pentential. It could be one of my favorite games...But sadly, the level design is way to hard. I played Mirror's edge to death getting every achievement for it (on Xbox), I SpeedRun DeadCore all the time, I even got in the top 10 fastest runs on the game, but this game...When you try to do a level fast, there's only one path you can take and there's only one way to take it. Everything from the speed at wich you get there, the number of milliseconds you pressed spacebar, to the orientation of your cursor has to be perfect to do the jump. The levels aren't open enough and the platforms are way to tiny. I don't mind dying a thousand time over a level, but I want to feel that I genuinly made a mistake and not that the game is punishing me for no reasons.There's an achievement about beating dev times on the levels... These dev times are not Mario Kart dev times or DeadCore dev times in the style of ""Our best time was 12.345 seconds... Let's make a 15 seconds dev time, so that way people have a chance to beat it."" Nope! I mean they could put their real time in I wouldn't mind, if the levels were open ended. Exemple: if a dev made the best run possible on road A and uploaded his time, that's good and pretty much unbeatable, but if you jump between road A, B and C to create road D, you can do it in 9.843 seconds! That's good design.My point is: So far, the game has an incredible core, but lacks polish. Keep the mechanics the same, but build better levels. Keep the insanity levels you have there, but build some more accecible levels too. That way, people won't finish tutorial saying: The control scheme looks kinda hard to get, but with the first level the game should let me experim- oh my god what the hell is this.Maybe after a couple of updates this review will change for a thumbs up. I can only hope for the best.			",116,15,1,4,9,0,10

								Personally, I do not like this game at all. For me it was extremely discouraging to keep landing on platforms, however just slide off and fall. I don't understand how other people find the game relaxing, as for me it was just frustrating and humiliating, trying over and over again and seeming to do nothing right. It's like you have no weight, and are just sliding around on.. butter, I guess. The jumping didn't seem very consistent, and neither did the sprinting. Another issue I seemed to have is that i would land on the edge of a platform, only to be pushed off despite me making it. I couldn't even get halfway through the first level. So, here are the pros and cons for me.Pros:-Nice music.-Simple and sleek graphics.Cons:-Wiggity jumping.-Platforms made of ice, butter, pure oil, I don't know.-No weight to you, it's like you're made of air.-Frustrating to no end.-Very dissapointed, becuase i thought I was going to enjoy this game.Sorry my review is so long, I just wanted to put in everything.

								SinaRun is a very fast paced jumping platformer where you try to beat levels as fast as possible. Having speedrun Portal 2 for almost 1,000hrs as well as lightly speedrunning Skyrim and Mirror's Edge I thought I’d love this game, but I was very disappointed. You barely have any control over your character and the turning is almost non-existent. I thought you would be able to strafe using a and d but sadly once you get going you are pretty much committed to going forwards. Trying to control the speed of your character is pretty tough and you get no feel of when you’re landing on platforms which makes timing the next jump difficult, not to mention how quickly to slide off of platforms once you hit them. I tried to fix this issue by attempting to rebind jump to mouse wheel but the game won't let you.Overall the game is more annoying then fun to be honest, I only managed to complete the tutorial and one main level which I died on around 50 times before finishing. Very disappointing as you need to be able to control your character precisely in order to complete levels effectively and you just don't get that level of character control. ",105,17,3,6,5,1,7

								I don't know how to start reviews, so here are some suggestions.- The level select menu only has one arrow, which makes clicking past desired levels very irritating.- The levels feel a little too long; I don't want to keep replaying the same bit over and over because I keep dying on a later part.- More levels. Some of the ones you have are fantastic.- Fullscreen.- Jumping has a 1/4 second delay, which makes jumping very annoying and unresponsive.- You can't really stop your character once you get going. (Some people may like this, I personally don't.)- The time between falling off and respawning can be very long on some levels.I really hope some of these suggestions come to light, because I love some parts of the game and want more. But I honestly can't really recommend this quite yet. Maybe you should add steam workshop support? Honestly, I think the game would benefit from some more levels or mechanics.

Quick Review:PoopWhy?MehSureOkayNice ⇦ DecentFantasticWowPerfectionThe Full Review: Factors Score* Description    Gameplay Nice* The game is fun. I will say that much, but I also feel that there is a lot more room for content as there is a lack of levels and content become scarce after a few hours. You will try hard to complete each level, but trust me when I say it is difficult and you will slowly become bored after all the hundreds of attempts try to 			complete just one level. Now, I might be a noob and I wouldn’t be considered the best player at parkour games, but I’m certainly not the worst and I struggle to complete these levels. I think that in the future workshop support should be added, and that should fill the emptiness that I can see in terms of level variety. All of the 		menus look nice enough, but I think the main aspect letting this factor down for the game is most definitely lack of modes and maps. Multiplayer for this game is available, but the community is very quiet so finding someone to play with is very difficult. Adding a workshop feature to the game would improve this situation, and mean 	that potentially more people would be playing the game; and community made maps. Graphics Nice* Graphics in this game are good, and models are clear and as nice as you would expect for these kind of games. However, I think that more models could be added, to improve the background and surrounding of the maps. At the moment they are a little bland and could use some variety in colour and shape. Currently, all the 	maps contain the same shapes in different sizes and positions, and with an addition of different colours and models, the overall gameplay could improve and I would be giving this factor a higher score.  Sound Decent* Music in the game sounds like restaurant music, and I think that the genre doesn’t really suit the game and a faster pace track would be better suited. However, the music is good and is quite calming and relaxing. But the end line is that, the music really doesn’t fit the genre of the game, but I can undertsnad as to why this 	type of music has been used, and that is to relax the mood of the game - rather than keeping you on edge. Controls Okay* Gamepads are supported but they don’t work well. This is stated on the menu as it says ‘Keyboard & Mouse Highly Recommended’ and I feel that although they are not recommended, they should still work properly. I tried playing the game with a DUALSHOCK®3 controller and I was disappointed. I knew that I wouldn’t be 		able to properly enjoy the game, but I couldn’t move the player’s view quick enough, and so I couldn’t play the game at all. Even with sensitivity set to the highest, I still couldn’t play. Mouse & keyboard controls work absolutely fine, and I think that all of the different abilities are positioned in the correct place, to allow easy access on the keyboard. If you want to, then the game does give you the option to rebind controls giving the freedom to customize.      OVERALL SCORE Nice*    *All scores can be found in the key at the top of the review ",92,22,4,7,24,2,9

								No thanks. Looks and sounds fine but the controls and speed increase and decrease feeks wierd and slippery. The jump in difficulty from the Tutorial to the first level is astounding. Didnt even finish a level. Died a hundred times. Closed the game.			",89,13,4,11,12,0,7

Early Access Review
								Absolutely loving this game and even have it running as I type out this review.If any of you reading this have a love for Quake jumping or surfing/bhopping in CS then you will feel right at home with this game, and I would consider this to be the main demographic of the buyers, but would also serve as a great introduction to this sub-genre for first-timers.The soundtrack for this game is absolutely fantastic. It soothes your soul as you approach the 200 deaths mark and allows you to keep on going trying to beat that time!Another great thing about this game is that you can see the dev's time for each of the levels, which shows you that the dev cares about this game and is pretty damn good at their own game! I can assure you as a new player it will be taking you quite a while before you can beat the dev's time let alone the #1 spot time!A couple of suggestions I would like to address to the dev:The game likes to switch from fullscreen back to windowed (an easy way to replicate this is to have it and then press ""Escape"" to bring up the options menu which will put it into a windowed state).Some keybinding options are not possible for instance binding ""Jump"" to ""Mouse 2"". I would love this due to all of the time I've put into KZ in CS where I either long jump with right click or regular jump with scroll down (I appreciate that jump cannot really be bound to scroll down as jumping in this game has a ""height on hold"" mechanic - although it would be an interesting addition if you did allow jump to be bound to Space/Mouse 2 and also have the possibility for scroll up/down to also be bound for minimum height jumps! Just an idea!)I've noticed that ""crosshair"" is a toggleable option in this game. I think it would be fantastic if it is possible to customise this crosshair. Resize/re-shape etc similar to the sort of crosshair customisation you can find in CS:GO.Another thing I would like to see added is the option for jumping sounds (probably footstep/landing sounds also) and I'm sure any Quake or CS player would also love this to be added. I understand if you wouldn't want to add this to the minimalistic theme of the game, however jumping sounds is just so iconic to these games it would be difficult to not suggest.Now for something you absolutely should NOT add - a replay/ghost replay mechanic of the top times on the leaderboard. It would absolutely destroy the magic of this game, figuring out for yourself the most efficient way to set the fastest times with what you have at your disposal.I would also like to thank Princesseuh for making a serious product and not making this one of those cheap ""rage games"" that you find a lot of famous YouTubers playing just to overreact and scream at in order to attract views. Thanks for keeping this classy.Now with all that said and done it's time to try and beat my 13.214 record on Wandered Hideout (watchout Princesseuh I'm coming for you!)Update: 12.201 record now :) Princesseuh you got some catching up to do :)P.S. I've already recommended this game to one of my friends :)			",157,5,9,15,9,0,9

'I wanna be the very best like no one ever was.'This line really sums up the game for me. If you like the kind of game where you :    1. Play it    2. Get Better    3. Be the best    4. Keep improving    5. Stay the bestThen SinaRun is for you! You can either try to be the best among your friends or try to be the best in the world. In that way, it really makes me think of Trackmania because I feel the same satisfaction you get from beating your friend's time by that hundredth of a second. And that's just one of the best things in life! Also, there's always room for improvement, so it really is a never ending game.I'm usually not a fan of Early Access games. But in SinaRun's case, all that is needed for you to have fun is already in the game, so it's not like you're buying it now in the hope that it'll be playable in 4 years. And for the price it's at right now, it's just non-sense to not get it. I mean, come on. 3$ ? Don't buy a drink at Starbucks next time you're going and you're good! ",155,25,5,9,10,0,13

								The game is cool but the controls need a little work. Its hard to control the character with the amount of speed you have, you can basically only use W to turn your character and its pretty much impossible to make sharp-ish turns.

								This game is too clunky and hard to even control at this point.I know this game is hard and I bought it because I wanted a challenge. I however was not expecting something this hard or annoyingly hard to even move in. The character feels heavy (even though they can got 1000mph just ""walking"") the controls feel unresponsive and late. the levels look and feel easy but due to the speed that you pick up mearly seconds after you press W is too much. You can only strafe a little bit not enough for what most people need to play the game properly.			",110,9,3,0,14,0,2

								This game is so hard and so frustrating that I literally only played it for 20mins before having to put it down before I punched something and I don't normally get that frustrated at games. I feel bad for the developers because the concept is so good and the graphic style is very unique, I just think that the levels could be designed to flow better so you dont have to constantly adjust speed to not miss platforms.Whilst the news suggests controller support, this is not yet implemented, so my review may change if this makes gameplay easier.

Early Access Review
								SinaRun is one amazing Fast-paced parkour/platforming game with truly stuning music and visuals.Since the price was lowered not too long ago and there are 33% off SinaRun coupons flooding Steam at the moment,the game is a must buy.I loved my 5 hours of gameplay in the bright world of SinaRun.Sadly the lack of levels in the game limited my playtime, of course you can increase your playtime by ""achievement hunting"" which will probably scar you for life.Without the risk of spoiling anything I could just say that I've had 900 deaths trying to get one of the achievements.Couldn't ask anything more from the visual aspect of SinaRun.The game is beautiful in its own way and it is well appreciated by a gamer imo.I usually avoid bright fast-paced games  because of my sensitive eyes but after playing for 4 hours in a row during nighttime I felt no eye strain at all simular to when I played Race the Sun.The music is amazing as previously stated and I would love to hear even more of it in the game, also a Soundtrack DLC is a must.The only thing that bothered me was the lack of sound effects when steping on something, sliding, etc...The single player provides you with a basic tutorial and 16 levels all of which have different paths that you can take on the way to the top of the leaderboard.Simple as that, executed perfectly !I never played the multiplayer since it's work in progress but I would love to see competitive multyplayer with bunch of gamemodes, dedicated servers and a lot of replayability in the future.The settings were enough for me.No issues there at all except maybe the lack of full controller compatibility which is not that big of a deal.The game plays perfectly with keyboard and mouse.After playing the game I wanted to make the level 5 badge but i was put off by the samey badges and not so great emoticons or backgrounds.Overall I really had fun playing SinaRun.It was different experience and I loved it.The game is definitely worth its price and since it's in Early Access I expect many big and great updates. 9/10			",167,33,11,11,14,2,12

								BugZy's Review: SinaRun - The best game you'll fail hundreds of times at!The following is my opinion.Retry, retry, retry, retry...SinaRun is a great 3D platformer racing game, where you try to get to the end of the levels in the fastest possible time by using your extroardinarily fast cybernetic legs. The whole game is basically a time trial that is so relentless that if you make a mistake - and trust me, you will make several hundred before completing each level - you'll have to start from the beginning of the level. No checkpoints, no excuses.The game currently has 17 levels including the tutorial, with the dev's best score displayed for you to try to beat and a leaderboard for your best score to be displayed publicly too. 17 levels may not seem like much for a game, but when you add the time between your fails and the amount of fails you have accrued, it quickly adds up, especially when you are trying to beat everyone's best times!You will gain some very useful skills whilst playing SinaRun, such as the natural instinct to swiftly reach for the 'R' key if you get stopped or slowed down when missing a jump, or the ability to get used to the control of your character which can be somewhat awkward to get used to, seeming slippery in a sense. This can have a big impact on your experience, but once you get comfortable with it it becomes second nature.Despite the game's visual theme being minimalism, it has a high level of beauty with the different map colours and particle effects flying fast towards you as you attempt to make it to the end. This, accompanied by the relaxing music that tries to keep you calm every time you fail, creates a very unique atmosphere (in a good way.)All things considered, the game is a great play if you would like something to play every now and then and don't mind failing a few hundred times and in all fairness, for $3, it's a bargain!I rate SinaRun 8/10 extremely quick wombats.

								great game, waiting on a friend to try multiplayer with. From what i've heard and seen, the developer is ""one of the good ones"" and sticks with his product, addressing critiques and gathering feedback. To you, Princesseuh, good job on not only a good game, but awesome relations with your game's community.			",34,9,1,2,2,2,1

								So an hour into the game i like it a lot. The movement was hard to get used to at first, but you soon get used to it. I like the fact that most levels are relatively easy to complete but to get fast times on them takes time and practice. The soundtrack is amazing and is perfect for calming you down after falling off at the last platform. Also the developer joined my friend and I's lobby and talked to us about the game and our opinions. The developer is nice and seems to want to keep updating the game and making it better. So overall I would reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys slightly rage inducing, platforming games and is definitely worth the price.			",87,13,7,13,25,1,21

								This game reminds me of a 2D platformer called gravilon, they both have a great minimalistic asthetic and simple platforming. The diffrence between this and gravilon is that this game fixes all the faults gravilon had and added a few more featured that couldn't have worked there. The controls remind me of when I used to surf in source engine games as the controls are lofty and the platforms are Icy. This Isn't a game you play to complete its a game you enjoy, the music fitted every level and its creative. Sure I only have .5 hours in this game while Im writing this review but Ill be glad to play more and get better and this minimalist platformer.			",28,3,1,0,5,1,0

								For the price of 2,30 euros, it's great game. It has great music and overally the game's atmosphere is really nice and doesn't makes you rage too much* when you screw up at the end of the level. The fact that it can basically run well on a potato and supports all three major platforms is a big plus.* The amount of rage can be individual to each person..			",313,37,14,40,34,2,28

								Very good game, great 3D graphics and a wonderful background music. Though sometimes is can be slippery when I run, but I guess that it's meant to be like this. Great game, I recommend!			",17,5,0,1,5,0,1

								This game has the most simplest mechanics and minimalistic graphics, yet this is one of the most challenging platformer game I've played. I like how this game made it easy to learn how to jump and get through levels, since the training mode lets you go through any selected level and let's you set restore points in case you're not very good at/not used to the game. I also like how if you're the competitive type, you can always try to get in the top of the leaderbaords, and if you succeed in doing so, maybe actually feel good for something you've done in your life for once. In short, here are the things I liked most: Amazing soundtrack Efficient training mode Pass levels at your own pace Maximum overdrive while holding shift Overall, I give this game 9/10. The only reason that I rated it as I did is that I can't seem to ever find a multiplayer server, or it may be that I just can't get it to work. I recommend this if you like going fast or if you simply like jumping a lot. It's a nice game			",14,3,1,1,2,0,0

								I think this game has a god base, so to speak and should really start to hone in some of the critical reviews that other players have left. For example I have only played it for a short amount of time, but cannot feel true control over the movement and find it quite difficult to then manoeuvre. I am not sure if this would appeal to other players or if it just me, but I seem to find that the visual quality is not there. By this statement I am trying to imply that it is a tad difficult to see a medium length in front but so far I love playing the game and hope for more when it fully releases!!!			",34,6,2,2,3,1,1

								SinaRun so far that I have been playing it for it's not that bad it will make you rage on some parts but the music in the game is really calm and relaxing but I would get this game if you have coupons or wait for it to be on sale that's just me but I recommend this game for sure!

								I love this game, however there is a small problem... i am colour blind (like my brother) and that means we cant differentiate colours that are close together... its still a beautifull game but going on the levels with the platforms having almost the same clolour as the pillars makes it difficult to play... again its not a big problem but and i still like this game a lot (even with my pathetic play time). i hope i helped some of you, and if you are colour-blind like me you might find it a bit difficult sometimes to see the platforms but you should still get this game.

								If it's on sale you should get it. It's a plat form runner witch is really fun. The levels are all hard and take lots of time to master. The multplayer option is broken or at least for me. If it's on sale and you have a couple of spare $ u should consider getting it if this is your style of game.			",46,11,1,4,4,0,10

								So. the last review i made of this game was kind of really negative. A bit more than I thought. And a lot of the cons were just plain up stupid. So i'm gonna do it over now.pro's:The game is BEAUTIFUL. It looks simple but amazing! The soundtrack is great.The gameplay is also really good. It plays smooth. And it is special at the same time. Never saw anything like it!The levels are made really well.It's really fun to just retry a level a hundred times and see how fast you can go.At first i hated how slippery it was. But i think that without that, The game would be completely different. (In a bad way). The slippery controls make the game a bit more challenging. That's good!It's also weirdly calming. Sometimes it can be a rage fest. But it never makes me wanna stop playing it. I'm always calm when i'm playing this game...Now that I think about it, there aren't really any cons...I could say that This game needs more stages, but that's already happening...Now one more thing before I end this review:I just want to thank the creator for still appreciating my bad, first review, even though the things I said were not right. You still thanked me for the wrong feedback. You didn't hate on me because of the weird review. (I'm still sorry about writing that). I can appreciate that.So.........GO GET THIS GAME. IT""S GREAT.

This is one of the few examples on how to be an AMAZING indie developerThe developer of this game was extremely helpful and was able to fix my issue in less than a day.  I don't think I can emphasize enough about how much I love to see a developer active in the community and also helping people with issues in their game.I love platformers and this game would have to be my favorite.  I love the feel of running extremely fast and flying through the world that sits in front of me.  Even though some of the levels are short, they are extremely challenging and can be completed in many different ways.  This game is simplistic, yet frustratingly challenging, especially if you're trying to beat records.This game is $3 when not on sale, but I would pay $7-10 for the soundtrack.  The soundtrack/music in-game is absolutely amazing.  It's so calming and sometimes needed for the rage-inducing parts of a level.  Sometimes I idled on certain levels just to hear the music over and over again.I cannot express how much fun this game is.  There is plenty of content to keep you satisfied for hours, or you could play it every once in a while as a timewaster.  Each run helps you perfect your movement and once you learn when to and not to sprint, you'll be 110% better.PS - You may have to unplug a controller or other periphreal in order to play without control bugs.  However, I spoke to the developer of the game and they said that they are currently working on the issue and trying to figure out how to fix it.Active Dev. + Amazing Game + Incredible Soundtrack + Great pricing = 10/10 BUY THIS ",1395,568,52,112,127,16,185
