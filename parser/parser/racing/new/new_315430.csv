												Over priced game made by a company with shady buisness practices. Game used to be $5, but the second people started buying the game they raised the price to $11 and constantly shifted the price around that point; however, whenever there is a sale, they change the release date of the game in order to get it to show up on the front page, which is a very irresponsible way to advertise a 2 year old game. Disgusting. Do not buy this game at full price. If you really want to play it, pirate it, but I wouldn't even bother since there's little to no content and no new updates for over a year.EDIT: Changed the incorrect information brought up by the developers.

												Polarity is a first person logic puzzle game whose concept is vastly inspired by Portal. It has similar mechanics but at the same time it is full of originality. The companion cubes might not be as cute as in Portal, but they’re still present in this game and needed to complete the puzzles. An innovation consists in the ability of the player to switch between two polarities (red – blue) which allows him to run through gates or to jump on platforms, according to the selected polarity.The single player part consists of 14 puzzles that are not too hard to solve, with difficulty increasing  each level though. However, even the most difficult levels can be solved in less than 5 minutes each. The 10 bonus levels are slightly more difficult to figure out, but they add new fun features to the game.The coop mode, on the other hand, is quite challenging. The two players must cooperate to solve the puzzles that are much more complex than in single player mode. The levels are bigger, now consisting in multiple rooms. The path to the exit isn’t usually the same for the two players, but nevertheless, they need to work together to reach it. There are places in which timed jumps are needed while trying to grab certain objects at the same time, and these jumps are not easily performed with a controller as compared to a mouse and keyboard setup. Sadly, the game offers only local coop and not online multiplayer, so make sure to invite a friend that can be persuaded to work on those together with you, without him losing his patience. Or even better, maybe you can convince him/her to do those tricky jumps :)Don’t hesitate to buy it, especially discounted, since it is a very fun game!More reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page ",1637,1093,27,166,215,13,292

												QUICK NOTE: At the time I'm writing this, the game is on sale at $0.54 (95% off). At that price, I could recommend the game, sure. Unless you absolutely cannot get enough first person puzzle/platforming, I wouldn't get it otherwise, especially not at $10.99.---You play as a hacker that is being paid (presumably) a large amount of money to hack into a level and steal data through some physical manifestation of your target's... network? Mainframe? God knows. The point is you have to go through 12 levels (followed by another 10 bonus levels), collecting 3 Data Fragments per level.The main gimmick of the game is that you can switch your ""Polarity"" at will - between red and blue. While a certain color, you will collide with objects of the opposite color (such as lasers, which will kill you), but pass through objects of the same color. There are also cubes (pretty much tiny Companion Cubes) which behave in a similar fashion. The cubes will power things when plugged into a slot, very similar to how Companion Cubes could hold buttons down to keep platforms suspended, etc. in Portal. Add a couple generic objects, such as launch pads and moving platforms, and you pretty much have the entire game.The game unabashedly takes a lot of inspiration from Portal: levels feel like sterile, self-contained test chambers, the only difference is that everything's dark grey instead of white, and you don't have a charming robot voice monologuing you or telling a story while you progress; the large and open, but still linear level design; and a general futuristic theme (though it's admittedly silly to mash both Portal and Polarity into such a vast genre and expect it to mean anything). You don't need to collect the 3 Data Fragments to technically ""beat"" the level - rather, you can simply progress through the level and find the exit. This is where most of the difficulty comes from. However, Data Fragments are required to unlock the next levels. They are usually poorly hidden, if not put directly in plain sight, and by simply walking around the room you can easily tell how to get to the fragments. The worst the game will do is put them behind a small puzzle, or out of your immediate field of view when you enter a room. To put it into perspective, the only levels I needed to play more than once were the first and second levels, where I missed one fragment each, because it was placed slightly out of sight or in a corner that I had carelessly overlooked.It doesn't feel good to collect data fragments because the level design is not challenging at all. The main ""puzzle"" in each level often requires next to no thinking. I beat all 22 single-player levels in about 50 minutes, and was fairly bored the entire way through. Sadly, this is why I can't say I recommend this title.It's not that the art style is uninspired and simple - that doesn't necessarily make a game bad.It's not that the music, and the general sound design for that matter, has a generic, forgettable 80s futuristic feel, which I'd normally think was quite humorous or charming - lots of devs these days just use stock royalty-free music and nobody seems to mind that too much. At least this has custom music (I think).It's not that it's trying to copy Portal - I don't see a huge amount wrong with following the footsteps of a very successful puzzle game and trying to recreate that formula!It's not even that the first person animations, head bobbing, and movement glitches make it painfully obvious this is a 3D Unity game. Or that my Logitech F310 - a fairly good controller when it comes to compatibility - would only work during the main menu and the two ""cutscenes"" that exist in singleplayer.The problem is the frankly depressing lack of content, and, more importantly, the content that IS there is unchallenging, unengaging, and simply not fun. As a developer, I'd be disappointed if I spent a significant amount of time and effort building a game and only could be bothered to make a few mediocre-at-best levels that don't even show the potential of what few mechanics that DO exist. As a consumer, I'm very confused with how this game has so many positive reviews - must just be me being out of touch with the puzzle game community. Don't expect level design that lives up to Portal, or any other good puzzle game I can think of, really.TL;DR - Game's really dry on content, and what content DID manage to find its way in is insultingly easy and boring. I'd say it's worth neither your time nor your money. Get on a crazy 95% off sale, if at all.			",115,27,4,10,13,1,7

Polarity is a fun little puzzle game, whether you are in for some achievement hunting or simply want to face some brain challenges. However, note that this game's stages are nowhere near the level of other puzzles games such as Portal or The Talos Principle. Most of the levels in Polarity won't leave you thinking for more than 2 or 3 minutes, sometimes the solution is painfully obvious, making the completion of this game feel rushed, even though there are 20 levels attached to it.The goal of the game is to reach the end chamber of each level (similar to the Portal series). In doing so, you have to make use of red and blue cubes in order to activate different mechanisms. In addition, you can change your player's ""polarity"" from red to blue and vice-versa. This is mainly useful because some walls only allow you to pass through them if you are in their specific polarity.We are presented with a poor attempt at a story, which will not matter in the slightest throughout the game and only serves as a filler. However, this isn't anything important if you don't care much about a storyline. Polarity is, after all, a puzzle game.The game looks pretty, visuals are nothing too impressive, but they're on point for its genre. Unfortunately, the game seems unpolished. There are glitches, some slightly unfinished areas, while the places which represent abyssal falls are literally... void, leaving the map in a lackluster state.The music is pretty much alright. Fortunately, there's a couple of songs attached to it, so the same tune will not repeat through each level.The store page of the game claims to feature a multiplayer factor. However, this is partly true. You can only play a local co-op campaign with your friend, on the same computer, using either a keyboard and a controller, or two controllers.Summary:Pros: + Fun little game to kill time with and relax;+ Overall a nice simplistic approach to games such as Portal;+ Collectibles and achievements, as well as the co-op campaign, encourage replayability;+ Ambient music that fits the game's setting;Cons: - Some people will find the experience lacking, due to the easy challenges and small amount of gameplay mechanics; in addition, this may lead to a fast completion of the game, maybe too fast for its price;- Unfinished, visually speaking; the pits that serve as obstacles are pitch black, as if parts of the map are just missing;- Even though a multiplayer feature is out of the question, since the player base is pretty much dead, a more advanced co-op feature would be appreciated, letting players play with their friends, each on their own system;- Occasional bugs here and there;Personal rating: 62/100 - Decent			",521,139,19,60,34,7,43

But I think that the game isn't finished because at the end of the story's levels, there is a level called ""story 2"" so I hope that there will be new levels...

												There’s a sad irony to how Polarity succeeds at being both bloated with ideas and creatively bankrupt.Every few levels it throws out a new mechanic - binary colored platforms, rotating switches, color changing portals, to name a few - but it barely gives time to show how they function before it decides to move onto something new. The constant stream of introductions to tools that are barely utilized keeps Polarity from ever managing to create puzzles that provide any sort of challenge.From the main campaign, to the coop levels, and even the bonus stages (which could have just as well been included with the other levels as they feel identical) every puzzle is agonizingly mundane and basic. Polarity mingles in tutorials from start to finish, as if testing my patience for repeating the same handful of puzzle types for hours on end, chuckling to itself at how cleverly it has hidden its simplicity by placing it within tediously large levels that have a habit of breaking halfway through and forcing you to restart.The cooperative mode itself feels like almost a misnomer, allowing two players to go through levels together but rarely if ever requiring they work together, or even giving both players something to do. Often one of us would simply took over completing a puzzle while the other trailed behind waiting for their turn to help, with a few instances of actual cooperation being the sole highlight of the game.There just doesn’t seem to be any point to Polarity. It exists for the sake of existing but in a post-Portal world and an increasingly crowded genre, it feels trite and uninspired. I could potentially see a lot of things from it being spun out into better games, but it’s hard to imagine that ever happening when what’s already here is so disinterested in moving forward.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

""ONE OF THE MOST FUN PUZZLE/PLATFORMERS SINCE PORTAL""Alright, look at the statement above and then look at the Polarity. You see some confusion and/or incorrect statement right? Well, yes, and that one is coming straight from the guys behind game. What a promo. This has nothing to do with Portal, it ain't have portals and it certainly ain't have guns. Only thing that these two games have in common is first two latters in their name ""PO""Polarity is usual type of indie game - puzzle & platformer. And also Polarity is usual type of game that is hiding behind term ""indie"" Man, that guy who come up with that idea of abusing indie to cover BS, should get medal. For real. Now I'm not saying game is utterly boring, it's fun at the beginning and out of those 3 hours at least 1 will be good. Just after that you get bored.If you want to get everything, game will last you around 3 hours. ""Story"" yes ""story"" itself is under hour, then there is local CO-OP that will add another one. People asked for online CO-OP but I don't really think that would make any big difference. Game have as always trading cards and also 10 easy achievements.Price point is 9,99 which is definitely not price you'd want to get it for. At the time of writing this (10/4/2017) it's in 90% off for 0,99 so this is time to get it. Soundtrack was relatively pretty nice, and it's also in discount for 0,49 so you can get that one also.Now I really have to quit with these bellow or just average ""indie"" games because when I get my hands on some AAA most definitely I'll be dead from ♥♥♥♥♥♥.Bonus Point: Portal thingie was a lie!Rating: 5/10 ",105,13,6,7,14,1,7

""Blue or red forcefields?""Polarity looks on the first view like a cheap ""Portal"" rip off. But after playing it through it's mostly relaxing puzzle fun. Instead of using portals you carry and throw little cubes to switches. There are also switchable bouncers and moving platforms. But most important are the red and blue energy fields and your color change ability. We know this from ""The Flip"". Well, the puzzles get more complex and challenging on higher stages.For example you must fall through 5 alternating colored laserfields. If you have the wrong color you die. In each level there are 3 hidden data pieces to collect. The Coop levels are no real internet coop (they are just local coop). But with an additional gamepad controller + keyboard they are quite doable on your own. Altogether very joyful.			",1636,665,58,135,164,17,216

												Sometimes, it isn't one big thing, but a lot of little things.  In this case, that lot of little things make me feel like I'm playing a university student's final project for their game design class rather than a Real Game That You Pay Money For And Stuff.Here are some examples, in no particular order: There appear to be at most twelve to fifteen different textures for the entire game.  Many puzzle elements appear to be deliberately constructed to minimize the number and complexity of their textures.  To the game's credit, what textures do exist are visually distinctive, rather than the twenty or thirty variations on ""industrial, brown, and ugly"" you will find in more than a few ""modern"" games. The game's plot appears on a series of simple dialog boxes, and appears to have nothing whatsoever to do with the gameplay except insofar as it dictates the names of a few puzzle elements here and there. The game presents dual controller/keyboard+mouse prompts everywhere, except for a few places where it displays controller prompts only.  It does not adjust the prompts based on the input method, nor is it capable of accepting keyboard+mouse input while in controller mode (or vice-versa).  It does (apparently) try to guess the correct input mode, but I only know this because it guessed wrong. The ""data fragments"" you are expected to collect are in many cases simply scattered about the level.  Finding them is an easter-egg hunt, not a puzzle challenge as with (e.g.) the stars in the Talos Principle.  This appears to largely stem from the baffling design choice to provide a fixed three fragments per (short) level rather than making them rare and irregular enough to be interesting. The cubes you can pick up do not respect the inertia of a moving platform.  If you drop them onto a (horizontally) moving platform, the cubes will stay where they are and fall off. The game has somewhat limited animation.  Buttons do not depress when activated.  Objects are destroyed by instantly replacing them with untextured particle effects. The menus are mostly static and not very pretty.  They do not take advantage of the high resolution of my monitor.  This is not to say they are pixelated or otherwise mangled; they just aren't all that pleasant to look at.The smoking gun, of course, is the ""readme"" on the game's main menu, which informs us that the game was made by a small group of people coding it ""in their bedrooms,"" whatever that's supposed to mean.  Ordinarily this would inspire lenience in me, especially since I paid a mere $1.50 for it.  But the note then goes on to exhort the player to purchase the game if they enjoyed it, which suggests to me it was intended for a demo and (accidentally?) included in the final copy.  Combine that with a complete lack of such a warning on the main store page, and I'm just not inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt here.Nevertheless, it is better than nothing.  Buy it when it's 90% off.			",169,58,1,28,27,3,28

												I gotta say that Polarity is a short, but fun experience in my books, but anyway here's the review:So far, Polarity is a really fun, short, but simple game to play. It consists of 37 levels, including co-op levels, which some of them can be challenging, but not to the point of frustration. You can also collect Data Fragments in each level, which are used to unlock more levels and add a little bit more fun to the game. The gameplay is very similar to Portal, but in a different way, and that's what makes this game unique. I find the graphics pretty good and I also love the music in this game! The ambience in the music fits perfectly inside of an obstacle course/ facility setting. This game also includes achievements and trading cards, which is also a plus.In conclusion, Polarity is just a casual and pretty fun game for people to play if they're bored and have nothing to do.Should you buy this game?If you're looking for a fun game to chill with, then Polarity is the game for you.9.5/10			",28,8,4,5,5,0,0

												This game has been released several times now. Each time the release happened nothing had changed and the price was increaed. There is a very short campaign with little to no content. I finished the game in 4 hours, and spent the rest of the time trying to get the multiplayer to work. The mechanics aren't good and some feel like they were ripped straight out of portal, a better game that everybody should buy. Some ""puzzles"" feel so agrovating that I nearly cared about this cash grabber. The only reason i got this game was that it costed without sale $5 and with sale 45 cents. The $15 price is outragous and not worth this pitiful atempt at a game. Do not buy if you want a decent game.Edit: HAHAHAHAH. I'm laughing my ♥♥♥ of after the devs realised they are reciving a huge amount of flak after raising the price to $15 and decided to not only lower the price to $10 but also put it on sale as they are desprate to not have the new player's thoughts to buy the game ruined. No, I will not be changing my thoughts about this game and think the devs are even more scummy than before.			",60,7,0,9,22,2,11

												Considering the size of team that made this, it's pretty good. I enjoyed it, BUT it shouldn't be compared to Portal whatsoever. The ""puzzles"" were far too easy and most of what you had to do was more like a platformer game. You get to the end expecting Story 2 to unlock when you get the last 3 data nodes and it shows the icon, but no more after that. The bonus levels were even easier. I like the concept, but it shouldn't have been released in this state, imho.I got this for free from a contest I participated in, and I see it's for sale for $11. No way I'd ever pay that knowing there's only a little over an hour of play and the coop is freaking split screen. That's ridiculous. I think a reasonable price would be $1.99 tops.I recommend this game based on the concept, but due to it not being finished and the current price point... no.Will change if things are improved.

It feels like it's just a cheap excuse to explain the bland color of the levels,the uninspiringly empty and minimalistic design,and the plain use of solid colors.Textures are horrible and look pixelated when you look closely at them.Controls aren't bad,except by the fact that the mouse has this weird acceleration that you can't turn off or adjust.Cubes simply disappear and reappear when the 'Reset Cube' button is pressed,with no animation.Moving platforms behave weirdly. They just start and stop moving,again,with no animation, this without mentioning that the physics of cubes also behave in a very erratic way when on top of a moving platform.The UI,once again,features no animation.Entering or exiting a level also doesn't feature animation. You just hop from the level to the menu,from the menu to the level,because the developer did not even have the audacity to implement a simple fade-in and fade-outSound effects are horrible. The sound track isn't bad,though.The ""puzzles""  go from super simple to super confusing,in a matter of minutes of gameplay. Some of them require you to kill yourself in order to progress. Does that look like good level design for you? It sure doesn't look good for me.All in all,don't buy this game.It is not worth it's price,not even on sale. It is a shameless waste of time and potential.If this was a free to play game,or a public alpha,it would be OK,but as a full game,its unacceptable,as it is nothing more than a poorly built 3D game built in Unity,that feels more like a student project,and that being said,there are better student projects out there.

TL;DRDevs have strange practices and their game is buggy as all hellThis game may seem fun, but it's mediocre at bestLet me first give you a warning of the shady marketing/advertising this company practices. This game is around 2 years old, but the release date has changed multiple times. The developers claim this is a steam bug, but it has happened too often for it to not be suspicious and the developers try to dismiss the claim too much without providing any reasonable evidence.If those business practices haven't put you off the game, then maybe the actual game will.First off, I will talk about the general gameplay and what you do in this game. This game is a first person puzzle game. There are 12 regular levels; 10 bonus levels and 15 co-op levels (NOTE: The co-op levels are local co-op and use 1 keyboard and 1 controller, so don't think about playing with friends online). This game has FORCED mouse acceleration. There is no way I, or my other friends who have put more hours into this game than I have, have found a way to turn it off. The developers are also lazy, and do not bother to connect planes of the levels, as seen here[i.imgur.com] in level 9 where the walls and floor are not connected.The aim of the game is to solve puzzles in order to get to the end of the level. Most of this is done through picking up cubes and throwing them in receptors in order to activate certain things. There is also the 'polarity' aspect of this game in which you can change your 'polarity' from blue to red. For example, with blue polarity you can walk on red platforms and safely go through blue lasers. The opposite is true for red polarity. Some puzzles in this game are pretty fun to figure out, but most of them are incredibly easy.Now, the meat of the review: bugs.This game is rife with bugs. To demonstrate most of the found ones, Siglamii and I have created some videos showing them. For some bugs, there is more info in the video description about the bugs:List of bugs in video formReset boostMoving during end screenLeftover developer toolsClipping with developer toolsFrame advance while pausing Buggy cube collision Cube boost Ledge boost Wall boostCube clipping through wallsHigh cube jumpingThere are also strange framerate bugs that exist. On any frame rates other than 60, jumping might not register, and framerate also dictates momentum and jump height to some extent. For example, higher framerates make you jump lower and make your momentum more sensitive. Setting the graphics to simple will limit the framerate to 60; setting the graphics to medium will limit the framerate to 30 (if in windowed mode) and setting the graphics to gorgeous will cap the framerate to your monitors refresh rate. There is no reason for this.I hope reading this review has persuaded you not to support the developers with their questionable practices by purchasing their shambles of a game.Thanks to Buttravage, MHFSilver, Dungeonfire, Avetixz and Siglamii for helping the speedrun community and I find these bugs and thanks to Siglamii for helping me with the review and demonstrating the bugs.

												Polarity is a first person puzzler which is pretty easy and relaxing.It has taken some things from Portal but it also has alot of original mechanics.The game is kinda lacking story but thats fine.The gameplayIn Polarity you can switch you’re polarity to red or blue so you can pass through walls by being the same color or being the opposite color to walk to paths.You collect green things to unlock other levels.You can pick up cubes and put em in a button of a sort or throw them to it.There are jump pads they can also be on walls, there are also ones which you can turn around.There are polarity changers for cubes which is self-explanatory.And there are laser which kill you or destroy cubes.At last you have room switches which turn around rooms.There are 12 main missions and 12 bonus missions, and there’s coop also.It will probably take you around 2 hours to complete bonus and main missions.The game controls good on keyboard.StoryTheres not much of story youre hacking( aka collecting the green things ), and then at the end he gives you money and then he offers you a better job.AudioThe music is relaxing.Other effects sound like pretty basic sounds.GraphicsThis is a unity game so the setting are just presets and resolutions.The game doesnt look amazing but it does the job theres not really a artstyle.The only resolutions you have are 1280x720 1360x768 1366x768 and 1600x900.Other things there are three graphics presets : simple medium and gorgeous.then you have windowed mode and rebindable keys.Final verdictSimple fun first person puzzler with some elements of Portal and some original stuff,with good controls and mediocre graphics but lacking story of any kind.

												First of all, I would like to thank the staff of eq-games to provide me of this key. I hope that the key wasn't meant for writing a review ASAP since I found the code in my mailbox not that long ago and the mail dated back from may. I think I'd rather won this key in a giveaway of some sort on twitch. In any way I'm not going to let that influence my opinion.Polarity is a first person puzzle game where you are a node inside another persons's network/database/server (it is not clear) and you have to finish the puzzles to collect the data from your victim and to complete the hack. If you are bored with the story itself you can also try out coop mode, which you complete puzzles with two persons even including splitscreen which you can connect controllers so you both can play on the same pc. This sounds like an amazing feature, I enjoyed every splitscreen that you could play and it was an utter shame to remove that on any upcoming game. Also if the main story is finished there are about as many bonus levels to dig into. I did find the concept interesting and they certainly set the bar very high. When I opened the store page this immediately catched my eye: ""One of the most fun puzzle/platformers since Portal. Polarity takes it to the next level, demanding all of your wits and reflexes.""That is my main problem with the game, not the fact that it is comparing itself to Portal, but the fact that the execution of this concept is very poor. Okay I agree they have a lot of features to make the puzzles good like colored cubes, lasers, gates, jumping pads that you can rotate, bridges which you need to be the other color to be on top of them, and buttons that rotate a part of the room in front of you, gates that change the color of the object you throw in it or yourself (I don't think you could get in one of em so I couldn't test that). Those features literally made me decide to complete the game because they were pretty well done aside from the chance you may get stuck in an object. As a node you can swap in two colors, red and blue which were meant to make the puzzles more challenging but why limit yourself with only two colors? I think it could be more of a thinking game once you get multiple colors. Not to mention how buggy it sometimes is. The control setting is something you have to take a close look at but even then some glitches happen. For example I have set my forward key to E (standard color swap keys are Q and left ctrl) and whenever I wanted to move in the beginning it swapped my color while moving which made it impossible to complete the puzzles. To solve this I set this key different and that seemed to do the trick. The next problem to me is the fact that they did nothing with the story. They start of with a small intro telling you that you are a node hacking a computer. They could do something with that like make the map the inside of the motherboard or maybe give it a wallpaper with black background and green binary or something like that. Talking about the map that wasn't my favourite feature either. The map could, like I said before, be done better not only in idea but I think they are not familiar to corners. Whenever looking at the ground in the direction of a wall you may see an empty line where a corner should be (for ex Level 9) and sometimes there are corners but they are way too big making it harder to jump over them. Or you can see the floor sometimes not fully connected or stuff like that. The map is also a bit too big in some levels where it could be way smaller but every level had the same width and height of the map. The music was very silent but I didn't mind that because I picked my own music from youtube to play in the background. As for the data you have to collect, for most of the time it is not a challenge at all. Most of the time you just walk around the map a bit and find it convienently being behind a pillar or in the corner or so. I wish they did all the data placement like the few that needed a bit of thinking to get to. I was the least satisfied with the ending, even angry, they could've added a boss battle connecting it with the ""story"". For example that you as a node get detected by the computer you are infected and you need to escape the level before they erase you but they did nothing instead.  Actually they require you to collect all the data to unlock the next 'level' which turns out to be a simple text message saying ""We're hiring you as a hacker now because your node succeeded, also you gain a million credits hooray"" This game definitly has a good concept but the poor execution didn't do well in my book. I consider you only pick this up if you want to play a game just for the puzzles and don't mind the rest of the game.			",34,6,0,9,8,0,6

												Product was NOT received for Free - but nearly since it was only pennies in a Bundle xDWhy do I like this game - simple - it's challenging and keeps you working, but is still relaxing & isn't crazy difficult.  The Solo campaign went really fast like passing some of the easier levels in 40 seconds.  The Co-op was a different story - definitely required teamwork - & timing your jumps & changing color quickly was more work.  I'm the guy who mutes the music in so many games - guess what - the background music/sound in Polarity was actually good.  I don't really see the Portal comparison that others have mentioned - this game stands just fine on its own.So, once you've been through it all, I guess you could try to beat your times or something - I didn't see much replayability.  On the up side, 100% Achievements should be no problem for you.  Fun & very much worth the Bundle price.  But, if I'd paid the retail $9.99, I'd be hopping mad LOL - Just saying!  The Developer(s) did a great job - Kudos!P.S. My actual play time is around 3-4hours (forgot it was running one night & that ran the time up, in case anybody wondered). Cheers!			",87,58,1,7,26,0,9

												Hmm...If this were a concept demo or something, I guess I'd recommend trying it, but as a full game I'm disappointed. If I were more cynical, I would call this a moneymaking scheme, leveraging the Steam Trading Card system to get people to pick it up for 19-25 cents during sales and re-sell the cards for a small profit. However, I don't hold the developers responsible for this and I want to give this an honest review. If I were judging this as a concept demo, or in a game jam, or even on Steam Greenlight, I'd rate it very highly. I'm glad that Steam exists not just for big-budget studios to market games but also as a platform for small indie developers to try out unique concepts and hone their skills. I just feel like this game would work better on something like itch.io or gamejolt, in a pay-what-you-want market. As a finished game, I can't really recommend it.The core mechanic of Polarity - color swapping - isn't really new. Basically, walls/platforms block things the opposite color as them, lasers destroy things the opposite color as them, and boxes/buttons have to match colors to work. You can swap colors, you can change a box's color by sending it through a color-changing field. Oh, and don't touch green lasers. That's it. Not every game needs to be super innovative to be good; puzzle games can take simple/already existing ideas and turn them into good puzzles. The problem is, this game doesn't get that far. There's only a handful of very short levels, and they're all super easy, even the 'bonus levels'. In an hour, I completed 75% of the game (I started skipping to later levels once I started finding them easy). You don't really need to explore, or reason/plan solutions to puzzles, or do anything beyond the basic interactions. I'm not sure if this is because of the level design/lack of levels, or if the concept itself doesn't lend itself to difficult/interesting levels.It's also not polished. Level design is sometimes annoying: lots of wide open rooms without many puzzle elements (and a slow-ish walking speed), and there's really no point to the green lasers apart from making you return to a checkpoint. There's a general awkwardness to the movement (jump boosts and moving platforms are inconsistent, and held boxes get stuck on things really easily). Control setup is weird (it's Unity, so you can remap things, but there's a bunch of controls that aren't used/show up twice). The tutorial is really unnecessary (the game pauses to display button prompts when a simple tooltip saying ""WASD, Spacebar, Q, click, have fun"" would have been more than enough).Polarity doesn't really have much else going for it (I guess controller support and local multiplayer are kind of neat considering the suprising number of big-budget games without these features, but again they're auxiliary to the main experience and they don't really affect my overall review).So ultimately, who would I recommend this to? My friends that already enjoy puzzles would finish it within minutes, and my friends that are new to the genre would probably enjoy something that's more polished/complete. Despite all that, this game does a few interesting things right: Gameplay elements within the levels have a very clear and consistent visual design. There's subtle hints that players might use without noticing (like a white square/black frame that means 'throw a box at this from far away') and platform placement/wall design actually guides players toward the optional objectives. The system of checkpoints is actually really well done (most games like this make you restart levels completely). Despite my earlier complaints, the level design is pretty good overall, and it's clear that effort and time was put into this experience. Sadly, as a finished game I can't recommend it.

TL;DRIf it's on sale, pick it up for a quick whirl. Alternatively, if you have a child and Portal is too difficult for him/her (or if he/she has a strong phobia of cake), then consider this game instead. Otherwise, save the money.Another Portal Clone without the HeartFrom a technical standpoint, this game really isn't bad. The levels are actually pretty well designed, especially some of the co-op missions. But if you look past the chocolately outer layer, you'll find that the game lacks the nougaty center that Portal provides. There's no real story, the whole ""hacker"" bit only manisfests itself in the naming of certain things, but has no bearing on the gameplay. And overall, the gameplay is quite lackluster.And honestly, I'd might be okay with having no story if it wasn't for the fact that the game is just sooooo easy. There's no challenge. Once you get the hang of timing polarity switches in mid-air, which any competent gamer will have down by the fifth level, the game doesn't get any more challenging than that. The whole ""data-collection"" bit is also a bit contrived. Originally, they seems like optional collectibles that add some kind of difficulty, until you realize that they're necessary to progress the game.BreakdownPros Not too gimmicky, sticks with core mechanics pretty wellCons Just boring. It's uneventful, there's no story, the gameplay doesn't challenge the user. It's like flavorless pudding, there's nothing wrong with it, but why would I get it when there's all these other better tasing ones around. Had issues a few times where my character would clip out of bounds for no reason. I'd just fall out of the map and fall endlessly down until I restarted the level.Score: 5/10; Not good, not bad, right in the middle			",76,13,1,4,3,0,10

												I didn't expect much when I picked that game up.I actually saw this game lying on the Steam Store shelf for a crazy 0,36 euros, so I had to check it out.Imagine Portal without portals and humor.It's the most basic 3D puzzle game you can imagine. It's not as boring as it sounds.It's super-short, for one thing. It's not a game you pick-up and replay over and over again.It's one of those ""I've got nothing to play"" kinda game.Everything seems alright, but after diging in I've found some flaws.Controller support is clunky and it doesn't always work. The menus are glitchy unless you disable the gamepad in the settings. For most people this game would probably bore you to death, but not me.I've sat through this thing and I actually found some impressive puzzles.For a game all about picking up things and throwing them, that's quire an accomplishment.I launched Vs mode just out of morbid curiosity. My brother just died in front of the monitor.It's not a fun multiplayer game to play. The rules are easy and there's no challenge.Combine that with gamepad controls and you've got yourself a nice nightmare session.The best thing about this game is the soundtrack. Spectrosconomy is probably the best track on the whole game. It's in the trailer and it deserves some recognition on SoundCloud.Go look it up and show Ludiotic some love.For the full price, avoid immediately.Wait for a crazy sale to make this game pay-off.It's not a novelty, but I think I could let this game pass.

												how do people dare compare this to portal?This is something that you should be playing for free, it's something that a developer would create to improve or test his skills, not to sell. Am I missing something? I have no idea how people can love it so much when it's literally brainless 'puzzle' solving. If you're gonna get this, then get it when it has a huge discount, like it did during the summer sale (it was 0.19€ I think). The summer sale price should honestly be the base price of the game, like I said it's something that's supposed to be free, not 5€!Anyway.. I'll give the game itself a short review. The game just feels and looks cheap, the interface is cheap, the world is cheap, the physics are cheap, the movement is weird, the camera movement is also weird, there are only a few levels, the concept is OK, the music is OK and overall it's still not something that I would want to pay five euros for, I'm sorry that's just how I see it.

												Polarity is a good puzzler, but don't be confused, it's not Portal. The puzzles were interesting, though I rarely thought it was really difficult in a way that stumped me. The hardest part is finding all the collectable ""data"" in the levels, and I'll admit I had quite a bit of fun looking for and getting to them all. The addition of a multiplayer mode was a HUGE plus, and was frankly a lot more fun than the standard game, in my opinion.The viusuals get the job done, but they aren't anything to write home about. (Also, it didn't natively support my 1440 x 900 resolution, so that was kinda a bummer.)  Also, there are a good number of bugs that still need to be worked out, and frankly rip you out of the experience. holes in the ground that drop you down to infinity and don't respawn you unless you restart the level aren't fun, and I've accidentally fallen down more than one. In summary, I'd say to pick this game up when it's on sale. I wouldn't spend the whole 5 bucks on it, but if it gets around a dollar it's definitely worth your time.  ",50,10,0,2,4,0,0

												Polarity is a fun platformer. Not too chalenging, but still an enjoyable experience.It's pretty short, it'll probably take you one and a half hour to complete the campaign, although you still have some more bonus levels (one of which i believe is kinda broken) and even co-op levels.With that said, i'm kinda on the fence about whether or not this game is worth 10$ (i got this game from a pack, so it was pretty cheap). Also i know that this has been said a thousand times, but comparing this game to portal didn't really help, given that Portal 2 is a much more superior game in basically every single aspect.Overall i'd say it's a nice game... to buy in a sale.

												I got this because it came bundled in a sale with four other games for $1.50 and I thought I would try it out. This review is assuming you are buying the game at the listed price of $10.99. I have also 100% the game and my time in game is probably about 1 hours of idling so it is a pritty short game. This game clames a lot saying that it is the next portal ext. but it just is not. The main machanic of the game is to change your polarity between red and blue. You use this to pass through and stand on platforms and not get killed by lazers. That is about as indepth as this machanic gets. The other main machanic is using red or blue cubes that you move around that level to activate switchs that move objects in the level. The color of the cube has the same function of the polarity of the player you just cant change it at at anytime. In each level you must also collect 3 data fragments which are not that hidden. Pros:The 2 player part was not that badIf you can get it on sale it is very cheepSome levels were interesting and make the player thinkAmbient musicCons:$10.99 is way to much for a game that is aobut 2 non-interesting hoursThe puzles are not very interesting and get borring after aobut 30 minutesOutdated visualsThe puzles dont build on eachother very wellVery little story that should not even be thereYou can glich through some objects and the void is sometimes visableNot hard to figure out the puzlesLots of sniping cubes across the map and hopping you hit itThis game is not the next portal. It is a 6bear bones puzle game that is not worth the $10.99 price tag. I think a fair price for this game would be about $2.			",27,0,1,3,4,0,3

I managed to switch to keyboard mode, where controls need a little more optimization.The puzzles are nice and the graphics are simple. Music is so so but it does the trick.A good puzzle game, but far from what Portal is as many say.The tutorial is crudely made, giving you the feeling that this is a rushed project.No I don't recommend this one unfortunately, but I actually would on a huge discount.

												Great game to play in co-op mode if you're a casual gamer. Sure, there is no intriguing story. Sure, some of the puzzles may be a little easy for the hardcore gamers. If you are into the background and story of games or into extremely difficult puzzles, this may not be the game for you.However, if you're planning on relaxing with a friend, jump on co-op campaign and you guys will have a great and laid-back experience. The soundtrack of this game is solid and very relaxing, the puzzles are in my experience very rewarding and the game feels polished.The only negative is that there is no online co-op: only split screen co-op and single player.I do not recommend paying the full €10.99 for this game though, as it often goes on sale for 95% (€0.54) and even 98% (€0.21). You can even make your money back by selling the trading cards! I would recommend everyone to get the game on sale and enjoy a few hours of relaxing gameplay. DO IT!!! JUST DO IT!!!

GameplayPolarity is a puzzle platformer that'll take you through 22 levels (12 campaign levels and 10 'bonus levels') + 15 local co-op levels (with a horizontal split screen as seen in one of the screenshots).The goal in each level is to collect 3 items and then find your way to the exit. To reach that goal, you'll need to take blue and red boxes from one point to another. Sometimes you'll need to aim and throw the boxes to their destination. You'll be jumping from platform to platform, sometimes switching your 'polarity' mid-air. Your polarity is a red or blue glow that allows you to pass through force fields of the same colour but prevents you from falling through force fields of the opposite colour. This makes for some interesting mechanics. Unfortunately, it also means that Polarity sometimes becomes a twitchy game when you quickly need to push several buttons  during one long jump or during a series of short consecutive jumps.Graphics, sounds and other issuesThe graphics are very basic. They aren't pixel graphics but nonetheless they look quite pixelated when seen up close. However, they serve their purpose here and the 'laser-look' makes up for a lot. I don't just mean the force fields that are made of lasers, but the platforms have a laser-like edge and the walls and the ceilings have laser-like lights drawn through them, too. This livens up a bit what would otherwise be very bland graphics.The music is subtle. Actually, the music is hardly noticeable. Its volume is too low. You'll need to turn up the volume of your speakers a lot to actually hear it, which makes for tons of fun when another sound pops up, for example a new incoming message, which may startle you and everyone who's in the room with you. There are little options in the game's menu: you can adjust camera sensitivity and switch music and sound effects on or off. When launching the game, you do get the standard Unity pop-up allowing you to change the resolution, select the overall graphics quality and toggle windowed on or off.Controls feel a bit clunky from time to time. I used an Xbox controller because that seemed the logical choice for a platformer, but maybe keyboard and mouse makes for a smoother experience, I don't know. A strange thing happened to me when using the controller: when moving the camera left, it kept turning left even when I didn't touch the controller anymore. I had to tap the camera to the right for it to stop. The same thing did not happen when turning the camera right, and this problem doesn't occur when I'm playing other games, so it's a weird bug in Polarity. When trying to find a solution for this problem, I came across posts from people complaining about much worse involuntary movement of the camera and even of the player's avatar, rendering the game pretty much unplayable. So Polarity is not a fully polished game, it seems, and technical difficulties are not out of the question.A word about Steam's extra featuresPolarity has 6 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 just for running the game.Most of the 10 Steam Achievements are awarded for completing a number of levels successfully. The remaining few achievements are a bit more creative but are easily attained. If you don't have a co-op partner, you can complete the first co-op level by yourself to get that achievement relatively quickly, but you'll be left with two incomplete achievements: one for finishing all 15 co-op levels and one for finishing all the levels of the game, unless you want to take both avatars through each level, one by means of a controller and one by means of the keyboard and mouse. Verdict: it's not as good as PortalA lot of critical reviewers dislike Polarity because it isn't as good as Portal. And they're absolutely right! Moreover, the publisher of Polarity brough the storm of criticism on themselves by mentioning the name Portal in their game's description. Even though they don't compare their game to Portal (on the contrary, they say their game is the best puzzle platformer since Portal, which means they recognize they can't top Portal, but they do claim their game is better than all the puzzle platformer games made after Portal), they should have known just mentioning the name Portal would mean endless comparisons between the two games, a comparison they could never hope to win.But I'd like to judge Polarity on its own merits. In that case, I have to say I enjoyed Polarity considerably more than I found it frustrating, which means a positive verdict in the end. But I do have to stress that Polarity is not worth its full price. I mean, it's the same price tag as Portal, a game of which even the publisher of Polarity admits it is a better puzzle platformer. You should consider giving Polarity a chance only when it's on sale at -75% or better, and lower your expectations accordingly.			",232,141,2,44,9,3,34

												Maybe it's worth your money at -90% discount (I got this dirt cheap), but it's barely worth your time. It's a poor-man's Portal. Without story, without any production values, personality, without any cohesive artstyle or ambient music. it's servicable, but it's obviously something that I could find with label ""my first, serious video game"". I congratulate that someone was shipped it, making even a basic game is a pretty hard task, but we are at Steam, There is a strong competition and this game doesn't stand against it's opponents.You are better off replaying Portal again.

												A nice puzzle game that kind of feels like Portal without portals. There's stuff like launch pads, cubes that activate certain moving objects and open doors, a mechanic that allows you to pass and walk on different types of platforms and a co-op mode. The levels are all very well made and will definitely require some thinking to complete them. Each level has 3 'data fragments' which are optional to collect to unlock certain bonus levels. These fragments are often very easy to obtain, but some of them are very well hidden. One thing that I should mention is that the game is not very big (even together with the bonus levels) and I could not get the co-op missions to work. It's definitely worth the money though, had great fun playing it!			",146,13,0,13,6,1,10

You're just a block without legs that can jump and sprint. And you also had no hands but you can take and throw blocks. (Trust me! I have tried to see myself in the cooperative mode).Sadly the cooperative mode are only allowed in Split-screen mode.And the saddest part is I have no friends to play the co-op and now I can't get the 100% Achievement :cry:Anyway I have fun playing this game and will definitely recommend it.

												This game won't start from Steam, so I had to gather 5 minutes spamming the Play button to write this.When I launched it from the exe, the game looked promising.The mechanics featured in the tutorial was really novel.And that's where it ends.It's in the name of the game.The game is called Polarity, for crying out loud.You're meant to get around by switching your polarity.Yet, in the first 10 or so levels after the tutorial level (couldn't be bothered to count), I can probably count the number of times the mechanic was used ON ONE HAND.If that isn't enough, the graphics are lacking and the physics are wonky.Level design is wanting too; the first few levels were okay, but after that it becomes less of a mind-stretching puzzle per se (which I assume is the basis for it claiming to be the next Portal) but more of ""do you spot this tiny thing at the edge that you have to press"", which certainly makes the navigation of maps challenging in an annoying way.Also, attempting to fling cubes across the entire map is just plain disgusting, and takes way too much trial and error. I can only imagine that's the reason for the cube reset button. More disturbingly, it's the most efficient way to place cubes on a receptacle. If randomly spamming cubes at different angles and hoping one gets caught by the receptacle is the best way of putting a cube on the receptacle, I don't see why I should invest any more of my time in this game.Certainly wouldn't recommend buying for anything more expensive than the 98% off sale price.(I also wouldn't recommend buying it for the sale price since it's such a terrible game, but you get card drops if you actually manage to start it up.)

												A short, light, relaxing puzzle game that you can finish in one sitting. It's actually refreshing to see a puzzle game that doesn't overdo it -- a lot of them will have 50, 100 levels that ramp up in difficulty and confound you for hours of play time but not give much reward. Polarity doesn't either, but it's just simple enough that it never becomes tedious or repetitive. Sometimes you just want a snack, not an eight-course meal. There's not quite enough here to justify the full price tag, but it's a great sale pickup.			",130,50,1,10,3,3,14

												In short, fun little Portal-wannabe game worth 0.19€ bought on sale.That being said, the game has several problems:Bugs - There are quite a few bugs, main issue there is clipping and disappearing cubes through floor or walls when not being careful (had this happening several times in coop). Other annoying bugs include auto dropping cubes when coop partner dies, random rotation of camera when using gamepad (Xbox 360 controller in my case) while pressing nothing and no end game screen for coop campaign  (there is normal ""Next"" button which does nothing so you don't know if it's broken or what's happening)Difficulty - Sadly the difficulty is almost none, all ""puzzles"" are very straight forward requiring almost no thought. I'd definitely wouldn't call it ""demanding all of your wits and reflexes"" as devs do.Coop - It's advertised as multi-player game but it only contains local coop (which wasn't problem for me but it might be for others). Included coop campaign isn't really coop for most of the parts, there are few moments where two players must interact with each other to finish the level but otherwise it's mostly one doing all of the work while the other is waiting for partner to open the road for him (being a burden in short).Length - Both coop and single-player campaign takes only around an hour each.This might sound like very negative review but in fact it really isn't. Thought there are issues with the game, they aren't game-braking. I still enjoyed playing coop with a friend and can only recommend it for this next-to-nothing price. However paying full price would most likely change how I perceived the game.			",499,139,31,47,55,6,80

 Not very difficult, but quite relaxing. Buy on a sale!	 More suitable for a younger audience, or simply to relax. The graphics aren't great, but to be honest it didn't take long to get used to. Considering the game has a cyberspace theme, you wouldn't really expect top quality graphics (or at least I wouldn't, anyways...) So they certainly stood out enough to be easy on the eyes for the duration of the gameplay. I haven't tried Multiplayer so I don't actually know what the player model looks like, so in my ignorance i'll assume it has the same minimalistic appeal.The audio for this game, I didn't really notice it. That isn't a bad thing - I knew when something happened, but it was more of a confirmation than actual sfx. It added to the feel of calm under pressure, and aided the relaxing puzzles through what could have been frustrating experiences if it wasn't for one problem......It was too easy. I finished the game (all data fragments) and all the bonus mission in 92 minutes. It was enjoyable, so I would recommend at a low price, but it certainly wasn't something that I had to struggle to understand the solutions. It took a few attempts to actually do some of the solutions, granted. Some of that was because of a slight issue with physics/momentum that I wasn't expecting. If you are on a moving platform, you will continue to move in that direction as you jump off it. This means that instead of jumping towards what you are looking for you have to account for a slight air drift. Which, again, wasn't difficult to understand, just wasn't as expected initially.I don't know if this game was supposed to be for a younger audience, or if I am better at this game than others. Personally I felt like the bonus missions should have been part of the main missions, but if the game was meant to be a little easier I can understand why the difficulty would be at a mismatch in that situation. There were 22 levels (including bonus levels) for Singleplayer mode, and I assume 15 for multiplayer - given there are 3 fragments per level and 45 set to CoOp mode. All the same, I was sort of expecting more challenging puzzles, but I didn't dislike the experience up to the end goal.I doubt this game would get a great deal of re-runs. The base price is not worth the content in my opinion. That being said, I got this game around 90% off (maybe more) and I certainly think this game would be worth it at a discounted value. I have seen this game on sale many, many times. So long as it is half price or better, I would say go for it. As it stands, however, my view is that the game should be around four times longer, with much more challenging rooms in order to justify the retail value asked. Or maybe include a level editor and allow workshop support, but that is likely above the developer's skill level judging by the content provided. Again, not a bad thing, as I in no way disliked the levels that I played, I just don't think that there is  enough  content provided...PS - Technically, you can get this game at such a steep discount that you could sell the trading cards and make money, though if you are into that kind of thing you'd already know that without reading this review.

												Single player campaign can be completed in 1.5 hours.  There is no plot at all, nor characters to interact with.  There are some solid puzzles which are fun to work around for about an hour or so, but after that some of the more advanced ones suffer from a lack of explanation of puzzles elements.  The music might as well not have been there.  For it's price point ($10 as I write this) I cannot recomend.  All in all this seems more like a grad school project more than a fully produced game.  That does not mean I think this is a bad game though, I was engrossed for a good hour or so, but it needs more to justify itself and its price.There were some elements of the game I didn't play (multi-player/ level editor / bonus levels) but I can't imagine they add a whole lot more to the experience.

												I love a good platform puzzle game and Polarity does so with a few additional aspect from other games. (2-11-17) I just started the single player game and plan on finishing it soon to fully rate the game itself. What I currently like are the elements the game mashes together. What I do not like is the lack of a background story. Maybe I'll get more story as the game progress? (2-12-17) So I finished the game via single player and I'm disappointed in the lack of story plot - the ending was very lackluster (in terrms of round and how the game ended). Two things that I can't exactly fully judge yet on are the placement of the data fragments and complexity/simplicity of the puzzle. Thus far, some of the data fragments are just plain simple to find and predictable. If I'm missing a fragment as I approach the end of the level (which hasn't happened yet), I bet I can just backtrack to the start and I'll see it. Some fragments require specific thinking/platforming navigation to get, but aside from that, not much of a puzzle to obtain them (hopefully they get more difficult to obtain?). IE: I found a fragment as I was trying to figure out which rotation to use and scrolled around to get a better view. Now that I have finished the game, yes. The fragments are pretty easy and predictable to find and obtain. The platforming isn't very difficult and this is especially so if you are not aiming to get the fastest time. In regards to the quality of graphics, it's fine. Not praise worthy, but also not terrible. I played the same level using simple and gorgeous and I didn't even care for the difference. I stuck with simple and didn't think I missed much out of it. I did notice the some graphics were slightly pixelated (not because many things were squarish) and not as smooth as one would hope for a game like this. Perhaps future versions will improve this. Also, pushing a cube against a wall causes its edges to disappear, which is weird.The sound quality was very soft, which proc'ed me to just play my own music instead. 2-15-17So I just finished playing the bonus levels and I enjoyed them just as much. Definitely like these levels more as they were slightly more tricky to navigate and required a little bit more thought in the later rounds. All the rounds preceeding up to the later rounds were still simply and just fun to navigate through. The last round was a very disappoint round however. Completetly different to the previous 3 rounds before it. I was hyped up from those 3 rounds and then the last round killed the excitement. It's still the same lackluster ended (story) so don't get too excited for it - thinking it's the bonus levels and you might get a different ending.Last thing to do would be co-op...Overall, my scoring would be 6.5/10			",52,13,0,4,0,0,1

												Honestly I feel pretty good about this game, however there are a few things I should mention for anyone who is considering purchasing this game.1) The levels are really easy, as you can see, (not sure if I have played more after this) I have played the entire single player campaign in 1 1/2 hours.2) The concept is interesting, but needs a lot more work, more elements in the standard campaign would be nice, instead of relegating everything to the bonus levels.3) Large areas, very little story, no voice work.  This game feels great for what I purchased it at for $0.50.  Now seeing the price at $11, it feels very lack luster.4) Co-op is couch co-op, no online co-op.  Which was confusing when I saw ""multi-player"" which I assumed meant online play, there is none available, so it was really mistagged.5) There are a few levels in which it is required that you die to progress, this came to a shock for me the first time, every time after it became the solution to harder puzzles.Final verdict, if you are purchasing this game while it is on sale below $11, then get it, its a good quick game to try and test your brain on, however if your not, consider waiting.

												Pros: -interesting visual style-the polarity mechanic is well implemented-great, immersive atmosphere-creative puzzlesSwings (whether it's a pro or a con is subjective):-heavily, *heavily* inspired by portal-HEAVILY inspired-HEEAAVVIILLYYCons: -Graphics are somewhat dated-somewhat jittery, even at 120FPS on a 144Hz G-Sync monitor, either due to poor optimization or locked V-Sync-Jump button often just plain doesn't work, even on straightaways-sells itself a little bit too much with that description there...Nitpicks:-There are points at which you need to sprint, jump, switch polarities in midair to pass through a lazer grid, then switch polarities again to land on the below platform, which can be awkward, given that you need to press both the W and Q keys at the same time-The game seems to be programmed so you can't jump when you're in contact with a wall, and the edges of platforms seem to be rendered as walls, so, if you cut a jump too tight, you won't even jump at all, making the timing a bit more pixel-perfect than likely intended-At one point, when I fell off, the game spawned me backwardsOverall:If you can find it on sale, get it. As is, it's not worth $20, but it has potential, and hopefully, with future updates, everything can be smoothed out.			",27,0,3,4,1,0,0

												And I thought the first Portal game was short...○ While this does have some nice ideas and a few puzzles took me a while to figure out, it's way too short. I 100%ed (all collectibles and achievements) the whole singleplayer part of it in less than an hour and a half.○ It's also pretty buggy, I managed to clip out of the map through a wall once without actively trying to do so.○ The movement feels really tedious - you can get stuck on a 1 inch step and have to jump in order to traverse it. The collision detection of jumping platforms is a pain, too, among other things.○ Then there's the thing with some of the puzzles... You know, in a puzzle game I like the idea to be ""spend some time figuring out what you have to do, then do it"" whereas here it's often ""see what you have to do right away, then spend 5 minutes trying to pull it off with the dodgy physics system and clunky movement"".○ Some gameplay elements don't add anything to the challenge of the puzzle itself, they merely serve as a layer of hogwash that can foil your efforts at any point (I'm mostly talking about the moving lasers).○ A couple times I didn't get any hints on newly introduced mechanics (e.g. rotatable jump pads or cube colour changing portals) so I wondered what the hell I'm supposed to do with a blue cube and red socket.All in all it's not an awful game but if I had paid the full price for it I'd feel robbed. For the current price of 0.21€ though it'd be a shame not to give it a try.			",40,2,0,2,2,1,1

												Note: I got this game for free by installing Out There Somewhere, which actually features fun, interesting, and challenging mechanics. Also, I haven't played the co-op stuff yet, but I'm doubtful it's much better than singleplayer.The Good pretty good background music unique core concept (I've only seen color-swap used in 2D) people could make some very interesting user-made levels if user-made levels were a thingThe Bad The learning curve is shallower than a stereotypical blonde. In each main level, the game seems to try to teach you about a gimmick that's specific to the level. One might expect that the level would then have you apply that new knowledge in a more challenging or puzzling room, but... that never happens. The level ends before that.Now, to the game's credit, the bonus rooms are slightly more challenging, although that's like saying getting struck by lightning is slightly less lethal than a guillotine. The game never seems to make up its mind whether it wants to be puzzle-focused or platforming-focused. In some levels, no dexterity at all is required - just figure out when to put which cubes where put the only available cube in the only available switch. In others, however, cubes hardly do anything, and you need to pay more attention to what color you are so you don't fall through the floor. But, it never focuses on developing either, so it's just kind of plain all-around. In some of the levels, it's possible to easily get stuck in a situation that demands you reset the level, losing any progress you might have made, rather than respawning at a checkpoint. Fortunately, the levels can all be beaten in about 2 minutes, so you don't miss out on too much. The physics engine can be pretty weird when dealing with the color cubes, and with moving platforms. Cubes sometimes get stuck in walls, and a few times got stuck in a spawner, only becoming dislodged when I rapidly clicked in its general direction and it popped out of a separate wall entirely. Cubes do not seem to interact with moving platforms. A strange amount of emphasis is placed on throwing accuracy. Polarity compares itself to Portal, which does not have this odd and rather inconsistent mechanic because portal shots travel in straight lines, whereas Polarity's cubes drop off at a rate never quite what you expect. A couple of the gimmicks are never explained. In the level that introduces color-changing fields, nothing draws you to the unassuming small gap that looks a bit like a wall. Additionally, you have no way of knowing other than sheer luck that the launchers affect cubes as well - no previous level required or used that information. In each level, there are 3 green thingies you can collect, for a total of 60 across normal and bonus levels. Of these, two, maybe three require any amount of thought to find them - almost all are either hidden in an unremarkable, useless cove 10 seconds from anything else, or directly in your line of sight. They're not challenges so much as they are errands. GET READY TO HOLD DOWN SHIFT! The player walking speed makes a tortoise look like Speedy Gonzales, and without a toggle, your finger's going to be on that Run button for the entire game. Polarity just feels... unfinished. Like someone had a couple of ideas for a game and accidentally published basic testing levels as the full thing. The story doesn't really have much connection to the gameplay... or relevance to anything at all.TL;DR I sure am glad I got this game for free by playing one that's better in every way, because I wouldn't pay $0.99 for this, let alone ten bucks.

												This is a speed-running, platformer puzzle game.  Each level has some endpoint you must reach by using color-coded switches and platforms.  (The colors are supposed to indicate opposite polarities.)  Each level also has 3 collectibles to find, which are always positioned in some out-of-the-way location to increase your completion time.  Surprisingly, there is no reward nor punishment related to how quickly you finish each level, so there's not really a point to actually try for the speed-running.  The puzzles are okay, but certainly not comparable to Portal as this game's steam page claims.  I found the game moderately enjoyable, but it's very short with less than 1.5 hours playtime (and that includes retrying a most levels for faster times).  The game could certainly use a lot more levels.  In fact, it's perfect for Workshop content, yet there is no level maker.  There are a few bugs with platforms and the small blocks used to activate switches, but nothing game breaking.  I'd like to also play the co-op levels, but the game is sadly local-multiplayer only.Ultimately, I feel like the game failed at nearly everything it set out to do.  You get a handful of mediocre puzzles that you can complete in one sitting, and that's it.  Not a bad game, but not one I'd recommend.			",261,95,7,15,27,2,18

Lets talk about the story... None. There is really no story, it just puts you in rooms and has text boxes explaining the mechanics. All there is the blue and red color switch as your abilities, and for the rooms there is objects you can move and move the room with.

												This is basically a platformer game with a few puzzle elements. Polarity mechanics boils down to switching to correct polarity when jumping on colored platforms. Puzzles are trivial and most of the play time comes from traversing unnecessary long distances on foot while constantly holding your ""run"" key. On a few levels it's literally easier to kill yourself (to reset your position) instead of walking back and forth.There is no narration or plot, aesthetically this game is meh, visually it's unpolished even, from time to time you'll see misaligned textures and z-fighting.Speaking of play time, single player campaign (not counting bonus levels) takes around 30 minutes to beat, but then it asks you to replay it and 100% it to unlock a ""Story 02"", which is actually a ""Thanks for playing"" message written on a black screen.I guess I could recommend it if you get it very cheap, but this game also requires you to go through extra hoops to be playable on some configurations. If you're playing on a 120Hz or 144Hz monitor, open your GPU drivers control panel and switch to 60Hz.Apparently if your framrate is too high, game from time to time doens't register jumps and this game has a lot of platforming. You run towards next platform, you press the jump key, hear the jump sound but there is no jump, you just fall off the ledge. This is extremely frustrating. You can't set the refresh rate in game settings. Judging by the forums, someone tried to contact devs about that issue but it's still not fixed. I also hate the mouse acceleration that is there by default but I couldn't find any mouse settings apart from Y invert, which is probably there just for the controller.			",390,50,5,39,12,6,50

												Since I can't really give a neutral review, let me just set this straight. Generally, Polarity is a fun, quick game that is perfect for anyone looking to kill some time. However, it is literally a poor man's version of the Portal games. For a standard price of $9.99 USD, I would definitely not consider this game for a purchase. Why? For around this price range, I rather buy a full, critically-acclaimed, better version of the game  (*ahem* Portal which also has the same standard price of $9.99 USD)  or even chip in some more to purchase the Portal Bundle or the Portal 2 game standalone. This being said, I only purchased this title because it went on sale, at a measly price of $0.19 USD  (yes, that apparently is possible.) To sum it all up, please don't buy it at its full price of $9.99 USD, it's really not worth it. Go look into Portal if you are readily wanting this sort of puzzle game. However, if you really, really,  REALLY  are dying to have it, I highly advise purchasing it only when it goes on sale. Nonetheless, I respect the effort of the indie developers, and will give this game a recommend.  A For Effort, F For Originality, Bluebutton Games.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you've played Portal, Portal 2, Quantum Conundrum, and Antichamber, you know exactly what to expect. Polarity doesn't have the complex twists of any of those, just lots of switches and platforms and cubes to pick up and toss. It is a small, unambitious game, but a reasonably palatable one. It's possible to put puzzles into unwinnable states, but this seems like an intentional design element and restarting a level is never a huge loss of progress.			",117,37,3,11,7,0,24

												This game... I don't know where to begin. It can be a fun timekiller for a little while, but it's never worth the full asking price of 9,99€. It's on sale right now for 0,99€, and I think that should be the normal price, because clearly there didn't go a lot of work into making the game.I guess the devs went for a clean and minimalist look, like Portal or Q.U.B.E, and I guess it's ok, but it looks rather dull and like something that everyone could piece together in some game construction kit within a couple of minutes.All the puzzles are very easy, and not very well designed. If you have ever played user made puzzles for Portal 2, you probably know what I mean. They work, and you had to think a bit about how to solve it, but all in all they seem designed quite badly, compared to the dev-made puzzles. Alle the levels in this game feel the same. Most of them don't even use that Polarity concept all that much. It's more about taking a blue or red cube to a receptacle of the same colour and activate something that helps you through the level (platform, acceleration ramp, opening a gate etc.). Sometimes you have to throw the cubes at the receptacles, which works reasonably well.The controls are fine, though the air controls seem a bit off.The main reason why I think this is worth more like 1€ than 10€ is that the main game consists of 11 (extremely short and easy) levels. There are also 10 bonus levels and a coop campaign, but... come on, really? At about level 8 there suddenly is this new mechanic where you can change the colour of your cube by throwing it through a green force field. This mechanic isn't introduced in any way, and the only reason it's still quite easy to figure out by yourself is because the level design is so bleak that there aren't to much possibilities. It's like ""ok, here's this red cube, there's a blue receptacle, and there is nothing else in this room except that green force field over there"", so your options are so limited that you soon arrive at the correct solution.Oh, what I didn't mention so far: you also have to collect 3 green glowing things (aka ""Datasets"") in every room for no apparent reason. Yes, the story tells you why, but they just feel like this arbitrary thing you also have to do that has nothing to do with solving the room's puzzles. Sometimes they're hidden, but that doesn't really work either, because of the empty level design. If you are at the end of the level and you're missing one of them, it's just like ""well, then I'll have to go over there where it's probably hidden and where I didn't go before because I had absolutely no reason to"".TL;DR: Puzzles too easy, just 11 levels in the main campaign, bad level design. It's like the easy first few puzzles of other puzzle games, in length as well as in difficulty.I wouldn't recommend buying this even at 0,99€ unless you also have someone to play the coop campaign with. I got mine for free, if you can get it free, go for it. It can be entertaining for a short while.			",482,167,20,56,53,6,66

												""Polarity"" is a first-person puzzle platformer that's hugely derivitive of ""Portal,"" except that it's:1)  much cheaper (both in terms of price and production value)2)  much shorter (main ""campaign"" takes about an hour, maybe)3)   much  easier (see #2 above)4)  much not-as-good, frankly.Oh, and there's no jokes...  Or portals, for that matter. There  is  one original gameplay innovation -- you can alternate the ability to walk between red and blue force fields -- but this is so rarely incorporated into the puzzles that it's hardly worth mentioning.""Polarity"" isn't a  bad  game so much as it's just a deeply unsatisfying one. Taken solely on its own terms as a cheap knock-off, it's made with a certain degree of underwhelming competence.  If you're desperately itching to play a first-person puzzle platformer that starts with the letter ""P"", and the phrase ""cheap but competent knock-off"" doesn't scare you away,  and  you've already played through both ""Portal"" games at least twice, then buy ""Polarity"" when it goes on sale for fifty cents (which seems to be every six months or so). Do not under any circumstances pay full price for it.			",139,124,0,13,5,1,8

												Very cheap game but very nice as well. Relaxing puzzle game that requires some good reflexes. It's easy to pick up, learn, and complete even if you're not that into puzzle games. I only wish this supports online multiplayer via Steam but the single-player part pretty much pays for the whole game. Also, there are cards. So you get more bang out of your bu...I mean...cents (when on sale).Prepare your eyes though, the player view bobbing up and down as you walk combined with the bright lights and dark spots may not agree at all with you if your room isn't lit properly and will give you at least a mild headache some minutes in. This may or may not apply to you as I'm only speaking from personal experience.I'd ask for more levels, but that may already be asking for too much.9/10 Great game			",155,58,5,13,12,2,19

												""Polarity"" is a first-person puzzle platformer that's hugely derivitive of ""Portal,"" except that it's:1)  much cheaper (both in terms of price and production value)2)  much shorter (main ""campaign"" takes about an hour, maybe)3)   much  easier (see #2 above)4)  much not-as-good, frankly.Oh, and there's no jokes...  Or portals, for that matter. There  is  one original gameplay innovation -- you can alternate the ability to walk between red and blue force fields -- but this is so rarely incorporated into the puzzles that it's hardly worth mentioning.""Polarity"" isn't a  bad  game so much as it's just a deeply unsatisfying one. Taken solely on its own terms as a cheap knock-off, it's made with a certain degree of underwhelming competence.  If you're desperately itching to play a first-person puzzle platformer that starts with the letter ""P"", and the phrase ""cheap but competent knock-off"" doesn't scare you away,  and  you've already played through both ""Portal"" games at least twice, then buy ""Polarity"" when it goes on sale for fifty cents (which seems to be every six months or so). Do not under any circumstances pay full price for it.			",139,124,0,13,5,1,8

												If you like puzzle games than this would be right up your alley, the whole game is a bit short though, you can expect to complete the single player campaign with bonus levels in under 2 hours.Beware that this game does not feature online multiplayer, so you have to get a friend to sit on the same couch as you to play.

May 19, 2015Polarity is likely overrated, due to a massive number of people getting the game for 0.19USD and spamming reviews. However, I do feel the game is a reasonable purchase, especially at a discount of -50% or more. Gameplay is simple and enjoyable, while the game has many rough edges and limited content. The biggest issue I can see is that the game is a sloppy Unity project. The launcher has limited resolution options, and the Steam overlay would ghost on the black borders. Level assets have cracks and seams, buggy lighting, and a major lack in refinement. Some puzzles can be broken by tricks, especially in co-op. Turrets are not solid, and can be ran through. Cubes above a door can be grabbed before the door closes, trivializing later sections. Co-op can be fully completed as one person flipping between keyboard and controller. Later co-op puzzles seemed to have extra cube-locks with no function, with no lines to show what platform was affected. Polarity has the hallmarks of the first game from a company, flawed but passionate.I enjoyed the game enough to bother with co-op and put up with the sloppy level design to 100% the game. The current content is around 4 hours, with levels consistently taking 3-6 minutes to complete. I liked that timing and pacing, as I could play the game while waiting on friends or multiplayer queues. Puzzles were satisfying and reasonable, and only the cube transformation field (yellow particles) was confusing, with no introduction to even show it exists. The developers could make several improvements, but the game was quite enjoyable. The -96% sale was amazing, but I think the game is worth more than that. Polarity is a decent puzzle option to spend a little time thinking, but this gem is quite rough.			",430,126,11,41,29,1,58

												I got it in a bundle for almost nothing, so i should not complain too much, but i will anyway, since this game has problems, and is not worth a full price.There are no proper options menu.It has lots of padding in the form of collecting hidden datanodes. They are unrelated to the puzzle and just there to force backtracking.Controls are not smooth at all. Useless sprint button (There are no situations where you would not want to sprint). Glitchy collision boxes that force you to fall when you feel, that you should have landed on the edge.Puzzles are quite dull, and most of the time requre no thought process. You fail mostly when you nearly miss a jump, or accidentially activate something too early.Game is also very short, despite having lots of padding. I have finished regular levels in less than one hour, and i was not in a hurry.Music is not good. While it is not horrible, most of the tracks get annoying after a while. Steps are too loud, and you cannot change the sound volume.Update: Decided to finish it, and it seems that bonus levels are even easier. Only once i had to pause for a few seconds, when ecountered a new mechanic. Finished them in less than 28 minutes. The rest of my time is waiting for trading cards.			",113,14,0,16,1,0,3

												Polarity is no Portal but it's a solid game in its own right. I see that some are complaining about its simplicity and its brevity but honestly, those are some of the qualities I like about Polarity. No puzzle is so challenging that it leaves you scratching your head. Each puzzle can be solved in a span of 1 to 5 minutes. It makes the game more of a relaxing experience, whereas, Portal could be relaxing or it could be hectic.There's little to no story in Polarity but I really enjoyed the TRON-esque asthetic the developers went with. Overall, I found myself enjoying this game and for the price that I paid while it was on sale (I think 99 cents?), I ain't gonna complain about it being short or whatever...If you like puzzle platformers and you see this one on sale, pick it up.8/10			",90,9,2,5,4,0,9

												(4/10)The overall presentation is spartan but not unduly or unpleasantly slow.  The problem that I could not surmount is the controls seem wildly inconsistent.  On dozens of occasions, trivially easy jumps failed to land, the 'jump' sound would play, as the character walked straight off the cliff.  Sometimes even just standing still I could press jump multiple times and only about 2/3 of them would actually register and jump the character.Given the platforming nature of the game in general, having the controls be anything less than 100% accurate/responsive is a deal breaker for me.

												You could consider this a sort of \""value brand\"" Portal, as this costed about 80 cents at the time of purchase. Throughout the game you will complete very intricate obstacles that can be overcome with insane mechanics such as ducking, jumping, and discovering answers to puzzles that progress you through this 80 cent masterpiece. There is also a sort of sidequest esque feel with the optional collectables during the main story progression. In the end you could have just bought a donut with the money, if I could do it all again I would probably buy the donut.Still a solid purchase though. Would recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS ONLY A REVIEW FOR THE SINGLEPLAYER CAMPAIGN. I'LL EXPLAIN WHY LATER IN THE REVIEW)I don't know what I expected for four dollars (though I got it for 19 cents), but apparently this isn't it.GameplayIt felt way too short, but that was probably just because they kept repeating the same puzzles/parkour stunts over and over again, such as when you have to switch polarity in midair to stay on/avoid the platforms/lasers. There were about 5-7 actually unique puzzles.Also, the mechanics weren't being used enough, such as the on/off switch and the rotation buttons. Even the polarity was mostly just used for either the midair-polarity-switch stunt or fields that blocked certain cubes.Plus, the data fragments were placed in awkward positions and it didn't feel like they had anything to do with the puzzle at hand. 3/10EnviromentThere's no real plot aside from being informed that you are hacking into some super important company (although it doesn't look like you're in cyberspace). We are never told what this company is, what they do, or why we need to hack into it.The scenery never changes, either. We aren't showed where we are before we take up the offer, we aren't shown how we get transported into cyberspace, we aren't shown how we get beamed out once we finish the mission, and we aren't shown where we are when we get the massive supply of credits.And it's completely clean with no props or broken walls anywhere, despite the numerous video games that showed us that messier was better. Portal had the famous Rattmann dens, Portal 2 had the facility beat up and destroyed in many of the chambers, Gateways had the laboratories broken into by a messy criminal, etc. And just because it's in cyberspace doesn't mean you can't make some areas briefly be replaced with nonsense code before automatically repairing itslef or have the lights take a while to turn on.Final note: There's just too much black and dark gray on the walls, floors and ceilings, especially in the later levels of the game and the bonus levels. Wouldn't hurt to make it half-light, half-dark like Portal. 2/10Co-opI do not have any friends who are willing to come over to my house just to play Portal 2 minus the portals. Either way, I don't think it would be that much of an improvement. 2/10The store pagedoesn't contain that much content from the real, finished game. As a matter of fact, from the looks of it, the prototype was better than the real thing. It contains some final levels with a better balance of dark and light, and one level that was two from the finished product put together.The description contains numerous flaws. ""One of the most fun puzzle/platformers since Portal."" is a little bit too egotistical and not very true. ""Polarity takes it to the next level, demanding all of your wits and reflexes."" is hardly true at all. I finished all of the singleplayer levels with all of the fragments in around 114 minutes, and I only stumbled across 2 levels that required reflexes (along with the numerous midair-polarity-switch stunts) and they were pretty easy. ""Full-featured local co-op campaign."" I am not sure about. 2/10OverallThis game is hardly worthy of your money, even if it's only nineteen cents. 2/10			",17,1,0,0,0,0,0

												Tbh, when I got this game last year I didn't think much of it, I bought just for its cool badge. But Recently, after becoming bored of other games, I dove into my library and saw this game again. Saying ""♥♥♥♥ it"" I downloaded and started it up, and boy, was I wrong.This is probably one of the most intriging puzzle games Ihave ever played, up there with the Portal series and Talos Principle. The way it is engineered is great, the whole ""don't miss a step or you'll ♥♥♥♥ yourself"" aspect.I really enjoyed this game, I just with there was more than two arcs.			",40,2,0,9,5,0,1

												Polarity in a sentence: Polarity is a first-person puzzle/platforming game where you, well, solve puzzle and... yeah.That was Polarity in a sentence (And a half, I guess). Now, it's time for the real review.Basic Info:Polarity, greatly inspired by Portal, is a first-person puzzle platformer. You can play singleplayer or multiplayer. Either way, they're the same kind of puzzles.List of Basic Uses:-Cubes: Used to activate switches, platforms, laser walls, etc.-Polarity: You switch your Polarity (Your color, some say) to jump onto colored platforms, or to get through a laser gate without dying.-Gold Lasers, A.K.A. Color Changing Lasers: These are lasers that you can throw cubes into to change their color from either red to blue, or blue to red.-Data: These are collected to unlock more levels throughout the game and eventually unlock the bonus stages. There are three per level.Other Notes:This game is completly Xbox 360 controller compatible without any configuration needed. There is also a split-screen multiplayer that has its own campaign.Story:Honestly, Polarity doesn't really have a story at all. However, you can peice together a basic story from what you're told.You're a hacker trying to break into one of the greatest firewalls in the world, trying to collect data so you get your reward that was promised to you by an unknown person/thing - 10,000,000 Credits.Gameplay:Polarity has you jumping from platform to platform, switching your Polarity (Or, some may call, your color) and carrying and throwing cubes everywhere. What I'm trying to say is that you may have to get through a  red  laser gate, so you have to switch your polarity (Which, by default at the begining of every level, is blue) to, obviously, red. That's different with platforms, however. With platforms, you must switch to the  opposite  color to get across, which leads to switching polarity in mid-air. What I'm trying to say is that your Polarity and ablility to work with cubes is all you need to beat the levels.Polarity has 14 levels in singleplayer that are not too tough at all, but can actually be a bit fustrating for reasons such as ""Crap, put the cube in the wrong spot - Oh, there it goes. Bye cube. Just gotta run back to the other side of the map again to get a new one..."" Most of the levels are short, but every now and then, you'll notice repeating concepts in the levels. For exaple, you may have just completed a level where you had to through cubes into switches and now, you're throwing cubes into color changing lasers and then putting them in switches. May not  sound  similar, but once you play, you'll know what I mean. That, however, is not too much of an issue.Upon getting every Data Crystal in the singleplayer campaign, you unlock the 10 bonus levels. These levels are just  barely  harder then the normal campaign, which is easy once you get the hang of how things work.Difficulty... That's an issue. This game isn't hard by all means. It's just fustrating. Like in my example above, you can easily throw your cube the wrong way or just barely miss the button for it and *POOF*! It's gone. You'll have to go back and get a new one. Anyways, back to difficulty - It's too easy, in my opinion, to be a puzzle game. WAY too easy. The Data Crystals aren't even cleverly hidden at all. You can easily get all of those. You'll also find yourself breezing through this game. For example, if you have even the slightest bit of knowledge as to what you're doing, you can get through levels in 1-2 minutes each. The singleplayer campaign (Bonus levels included) may only take you about an hour and a half. That's how short and quick this game is.Ah, multiplayer... I can't say that I LOVE it, but I like it. You and your buddy are robots (Sound familiar much?) and you must work together to solve puzzles similar to the normal puzzles, except this time, it's even harder. This time I mean it. It's not ""I GIVE UP!"" hard, it's just... Up there, I guess you could say. The Data Crystals can easily be passed without even knowing it, and they're hidden in better spots and actually take you a minute to get them. I would have to say that the multiplayer is better than the singleplayer just because you have a friend with you and you both get to slove the puzzles together.Conclusion:This is a first-person puzzle game that's highly inspired by Portal. Sure, it's not always fair, but it comes through for sure. I would just get this game while it's on sale, as you'll be glad that you didn't waste $5.00 on this. I'm not saying that this is a bad game, it's just I don't see it being worth $5.00. Not everyone looking for a good puzzle game will be satisfied fully, but I still love this game.To conclude this review, I give Polarity a 7/10. It could be better, and it wouldn't be that hard.

												It's quite obvious that this physics-based indie platformer takes heavy inspiration from the game portal, but Polarity doesn't have the complexity it's influence does, just lots of switches and platforms and cubes to pick up and toss. Nevertheless, it is a small, modest game, but still a rather pleasing one. The game has decent graphics and smooth gameplay, although the motion blur was a tad disorienting, but that could be disabled. The instructions are simple, and the game is pretty straight forward. Moreover, the puzzles are insanely basic, they are too easy and lack anything remotely complex or challenging to them. The levels feel particularly identical and short. Furthermore, there's no real story, although that being said, a story isn't always necessary. One thing that really ticked me off was that the multiplayer that it supposedly has, is nonexistent, and you must have a controller along with a keyboard in order to play coop. To sum up, the game is very short and lacks many characteristics that make a game good. Considering that the game is actually eleven dollars and not the 20 cents I paid for it, it definetly isn't worth the money. However, I do recognize that polarity has a very small development team and appreciate the game for what it is.			",49,6,1,1,2,2,7

The singleplayer campaign (Bonus levels included) may only take you about an hour and a half. That's how short and quick this game is.Ah, multiplayer... I can't say that I LOVE it, but I like it. You and your buddy are robots (Sound familiar much?) and you must work together to solve puzzles similar to the normal puzzles, except this time, it's even harder. This time I mean it. It's not ""I GIVE UP!"" hard, it's just... Up there, I guess you could say. The Data Crystals can easily be passed without even knowing it, and they're hidden in better spots and actually take you a minute to get them. I would have to say that the multiplayer is better than the singleplayer just because you have a friend with you and you both get to slove the puzzles together.Conclusion:This is a first-person puzzle game that's highly inspired by Portal. Sure, it's not always fair, but it comes through for sure. I would just get this game while it's on sale, as you'll be glad that you didn't waste $5.00 on this. I'm not saying that this is a bad game, it's just I don't see it being worth $5.00. Not everyone looking for a good puzzle game will be satisfied fully, but I still love this game.To conclude this review, I give Polarity a 7/10. It could be better, and it wouldn't be that hard.

												Well, we are not supposed to write a long text review for this Indie. So, just consider to grab a piece of gameplay from the most notorious Portal, then merge with some level design of Tron (Disney) and simplify the levels in order to have some funny quick to resolve games. This is Polarity. I appreciated this game, as I've appreciated the previous masterpieces. I want to recommend this game and tell you that it's absolutely playable and short, so if you want some casual gaming with nerd effect this is an option. Of course play Portal 2 and Tron if you like the genre.See ya!Lord Hol Napult's experience: 6,5 / 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a mixed review. Polarity is very similar to Portal series, so if you enjoy Portal 1/2, try Polarity. However, Polarity is inferior in many ways compared to either Portal game, there's no story, no voice acting, not many levels available and the level difficulty is the same throughout the game, and the co-op gameplay is useless if you don't have a pad controller. I gave it a thumb up because I enjoy puzzle games and I did have fun with this, but I wouldn't recommend buying the game at full price.			",185,85,5,17,23,1,36

												A (really) short ""puzzle"" platformer where the level difficulties range from easy to easier. The colors are dull, and the music just as so. While the mechanic of changing your polarity could have been used to create very challenging puzzles, it was under-utilized throughout the entirety of the singleplayer.For a basic game such as this, sure whatever it's on sale for 54 cents I'll try it. The main reason I wanted to write this review was to inform those interested in buying this game is that your jump only works roughly 30% of the time.Your jump. One of the most important actions for a puzzle platformer. Works 30% of the time.So what could have been a quick 20-30 minute playthrough took double the time, simply because my jump inputs failed almost always and I would have needed to redo most of a level.How you could charge $10.99 for simple gameplay and broken inputs?

I've never played games like Polarity before (though some people suggest it's very similar to Portal), and was amazed how easily I got myself immersed into exploring new levels. It's fun and relaxing experience, however very short. The game doesn't cost much, so it's easy choice and you won't regret you spent your money on it. The biggest disappointment for me was the co-op mode, in which two players can either play on two pads or one pad and keyboard, so if you don't own a pad you can't play the co-op. Using the same keyboard by two players should be also allowed (with customizable controls).			",35,22,1,10,12,0,3

I also hate games that have achievements for playing co op splitscreen but that is just one of my pet peeves. Now, the puzzles aren't super hard and don't require much skill but the graphics are pretty while the actual gameplay is solid and fun. You get to pick up cubes to throw them in what I will call ""trigger boxes"" which gives a portal feel and that's really neat as well. Overall this is worth picking up and definitely worth spending some time on if you even mildly enjoy puzzle games.			",114,22,1,17,9,1,17

Similar to portal in a sense that it's a puzzle game with cubes, but it adds the twist of ""polarity"" which refers to the color your character is in at that moment. If you're red, you can pass through red lasers, but stand on blue lasers. If you're blue, then flip that around.

												The game says it collects coop data, but there are no chickens anywhere and it doesn't look like Farmville at all.What is the CIA trying to pull here?No mouse sensitivity setting. With a gaming mouse, I have to switch dpi whenever switching between 3D and menu. I am beginning to appreciate that my mouse has dedicated buttons for that. Set it to 400 dpi, Windows to 1/11, still too fast.Same with sound volume. Too low, and not adjustable.Autorun would be very helpful, too.Dropped the cube on an arrow plate - couldn't pick it up again. A little bug I guess.One time the cube moved to me in slowmotion when picked up.One time I threw my cube against a wall and it vanished in it. Another little bug. (They're so cute. :3)One level had a fail condition, requiring a restart. Not a big deal. Just seems like unintended design.Rotation arrow buttons are the wrong way. The button showing clockwise rotation turns the whole room counter-clockwise. Bit confusing at first.Progressive complexity, without becoming actually more difficult. A generally easy-difficulty game for those who don't like their head to go up in smoke. Although it's also so non-exciting that it can become difficult to find motivation in the more complex levels.Jumping is nicely controllable, even in mid-air. Since there are jump-timing puzzles, this is very good. A bit bothersome maybe that you get stuck at very low edges and need to jump there, but you can just adjust to that.Menu navigation is a bit tedious with no rollover and no good visual selection indication.Barefoot walking sounds, yet jumps and landings sound like shoes.The 'story' is lackluster even for this game, especially because the 'ending' text abruptly goes out of character. They could just as well not have made a story at all if they don't put any passion into it.A game should be easy or short, but not both. This is  of acceptable length if you play all the content types. But cooperative mode I found bothersome, because player 2 can only be controlled with a game controller, and while I have that (otherwise not playable it seems), controlling your avatar using a game controller is a challenge in itself, especially if you're not used to it.Since I got this with heavy discount - 19 cents, I didn't consider it a bad investment. Especially since a foil card dropped, hah.			",181,65,2,17,12,4,26

												Polarity is the poor man's Portal, but perhaps that's being a bit unfair to Polarity; it IS its own game in its own right. It doesn't have an incredibly engaging story to it (in fact, save for a short text introduction at the beginning of the game, there's no story to it at all), but at the same time it doesn't really need one. The objective of each level is to use colored cubes to activate corresponding gates and switches to get to the end-level warp while collecting data fragments.HIGHS: --Gameplay is fun and engaging, albeit a bit bare-bones.             --Bonus levels and Co-op campaign add much needed replay.             --The music (or I should ambience) is soothing without becoming repetitive. Accompanied with the easy-on-the-eyes visuals, the game is actually quite calming (in the good way).LOWS: --The levels aren't incredibly challenging. They're enough to make you think, but none will really stump you or leave you stuck.            --There's a couple important details the game neglects to inform you about. For example, later in the game you'll encounter yellow gates that, turns out, change the color of whatever cube passes through it. An attentive player would be bound to figure this out on their own eventually, but the more casual player may not be so quick to catch on (especially when the FIRST none-red/blue gate you encounter without being informed kills you).            --The game is FAR too short, especially for the asking price of $10.99 (The single player campaign can be finished in less than an hour, even if you're not the greatest at puzzle games). The game could've, and SHOULD've, been much longer; especially with the multitude of potential puzzles the aforemention yellow gates can bring to the table.BUY or BYE: I say buy, especially if you're a big fan of the Portal series or puzzle games in general. Polaris is not worth the default $11. A good default price would be $5 (perhaps $9.99 at the most), but certainly not $11. HOWEVER, it IS a fun puzzle game that should be experienced, and for the current sales price of $0.54, you can't go wrong!			",106,6,0,6,2,1,1

												Very good puzzle game. I had a few problems with the platforms flinging me when I jumped but for all I know that could actually be a mechanic of the game. I also hate games that have achievements for playing co op splitscreen but that is just one of my pet peeves. Now, the puzzles aren't super hard and don't require much skill but the graphics are pretty while the actual gameplay is solid and fun. You get to pick up cubes to throw them in what I will call ""trigger boxes"" which gives a portal feel and that's really neat as well. Overall this is worth picking up and definitely worth spending some time on if you even mildly enjoy puzzle games.			",114,22,1,17,9,1,17

												Polarity is a game where you have to find a certain number of data fragments. In order to do so, you have to complete a series of obstacle course-like levels, and have good eyes to see the glowing green fragments. It is relatively simple (once you get the mechanics down). The cards are also reasonably priced, if that is your thing.I recieved this game free because when I bought ""The Chosen RPG"" (had a coupon), upon opening that game, there was a link for a free copy of this one.

												The game Polarity introduces a virtual hacking system where the goal is to collect data fragments and solve puzzles to earn an explicit amount of money from the payer. The game shows promising concepts and awesome game play. The things I thought were different were the lack of story line and the slightly overpriced tag for the game on steam. I feel like it deserves more levels because I strongly enjoyed the fantastic game Polarity. There was a few glitches in the game where the cube (The Red or Blue cube that activates pistons or boosts) could go through walls and or when I picked them up, it would go through its pedestal and in both scenarios become unusable forcing me to restart the game and try again. Other than that I would strongly recommend this game primarily due to the fact that it is so much fun and provides the gamer with a fun filled adventure on what it is like to be a virtual hacker. I look forward to any advances the owners include in the game and I thank them for such an awesome game. Please try this game for yourself, it will be worth it!			",36,3,0,4,2,0,2

												It's a bit rough-around-the-edges in places - the UI is a bit crude and the physics occasionally has a wobbly (if you lose your block you can summon a new one where it spawned - the game doesn't mention this but it works!!) More importantly tho, the puzzles are rock-solid enjoyable and you cannot ask for more than that.It's not Portal but it's not the repetitive grinds which were Magrunner or QUBE either.It even has speedrun potential tho I didn't notice anything like scoreboards for that (you can always challenge yourself tho!!)p.s. the slappy feet noise gets kinda annoying, did the sound guy record himself barefoot in his bathroom or am I playing a fishman and is this more Cthulu? :)			",606,162,56,93,89,4,107

												Interesting little puzzle game, sort of a Portal with aethetics more akin to Tron 2.0. Not too terribly difficult; most levels only took me a few minutes. Good distraction for a couple hours; I picked it up as part of a four-game bundle for about a dollar, so in terms of money-per-unit-entertainment... I'd say it was worth it. (Had I spent its current ""full price"" this review would have a very different tone.)The backstory is that you are, um, hacking some computer system or something? The backstory is completely irrelevant, and can safely be ignored.The game has a bunch of interesting mechanics (a switchable ""polarity"" that lets you pass through walls or lasers; red and blue cubes for activating switches; jump pads of various sorts; etc)-- it's unfortunate that the game is so short, since it seems like there are some missed opportunities there.The ""co-op"" mode is local split-screen only (not online, oddly). I was able to work through it (as one person) with a keyboard and a gamepad; there's little in the co-op campaign that requires active participation by both players simultaneously. That could have used a bit more work.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Obligatory warning, I really liked this game, but there is way too little content to justify spending 5 bucks on it. Wait till there is a sale and it drops down to 19 cents. I bought this for 12 cents after using the spare change in my steam wallet, and it was totally worth it then. Anyways, lets get started on the pros and cons.Pros:-Graphics look really nice for a game I picked up for 12 cents.-Audio, while repetitive at a few moments during the hour and a half singleplayer campaign, was nice and provided a nice atmosphere for the whole digital hacking heist theme. Not necessarily pro or con:-Many reviews mention Portal as what they were thinking of while they were playing. While it had a unique gameplay idea of polarity switching, it really could've used that mechanic way more than the Portal-esque cube on button style gameplay. Cons:-SO SHORT! Even with the bonus levels, it only took me about an hour and a half, which is why I recommend it only if it's on sale.-Not much of a con, but it was really easy the whole way through. Really could've used a difficulty spike at points.Overall a 8/10 for a game on sale for 20 cents,  ",25,1,0,1,1,0,1

Polarity  - A first-person puzzle game in the vein of Portal.****Arbitrary Number Rating****||//////||////||__ 5.5/10 __||\\\\||\\\\\\||The descriptions seem to make Polarity out to be a challenging puzzle game that is made for fans of Portal who want more. Beyond being a first-person puzzle game with discrete puzzle rooms that require you to unlock switches to progress to the next puzzle chamber, the comparison between Portal and Polarity is miles apart. The game isn't exactly challenging and the narrative is pretty bare and forgettable.Although portals are absent, Polarity does introduce some original, although very simple new mechanics to add to the ""drop off box at checkpoint to open door"" puzzle genre, mostly relating to the ""Polarity"" of the player. You switch your polarity between Red and Blue to get through shields and jumping platforms. Also included are co-op and competitive splitscreen modes, but I did not try those out. #Very short and easy, with little replay value. Great for those who are hankering for a small, small dose of Portal-like puzzle gameplay. Pick it up when discounted at 90%, not worth otherwise. ",66,8,0,4,7,0,10

												This game is brilliant. I bought it during a sale, when it was only 15p. Not only is this excellent value (I would also probably pay the full price if I hadn't got it in a sale) but a great game.It is a first person puzzle game, and you have to use the cubes and pads to work out how to solve the puzzles, not only to complete the levels but unlock data, as the storyline says that you are a hacker.The graphics are great, the controls are simple and there is a co-op mode for an extra challenge. There are some really nice ideas and some great puzzles in this game. I would definitely recommend this for anybody, and it also doesn't put too much (if any) strain on your computer. It also features acheivements (almost everybody should unlock the first one) and trading cards.			",4,2,1,0,5,0,1

												Fun first-person puzzler along the lines of Portal but without the post-apocalyptic psychotic robot.  Clean, minimalistic and effective level design with one or two fun-feeling standouts, and a slow-growing complexity that never quite reaches its potential because of the game's shortness, which is the only real disappointment here.  The main campaign can be beaten in well under an hour, and while the bonus levels are a little more complex, you'll be more seasoned, so they won't take you much more time to blow through.Still, definitely worth it.  Here's hoping we see more levels, or maybe a level editor with Workshop support, but if not I still have no complaints.			",159,94,0,56,11,0,19

												The campaign and the bonus levels were great, the graphics were sub par, the puzzles were well thought out, and overall it's pretty fun. The horrible part is that, although it is advertised as multiplayer and local co-op, it is in fact only local co-op. This means that a part of the game was left untouched which is unsatisfying since I paid to enjoy the full game. A step forward for the developers would be an option for players to create their own levels and play with each other over the internet. Overall, good game but needs some fixing.			",13,0,0,1,3,0,0

You don't need it xDThe story isn't as good ^^ Well, Polarity is fun to play! :3 WITH bonus missions it took me less than 3 hours to complete the game PLUS I played the 1st COOP Level on my own because of the achievement xDThe COOP with 2 people (xD) is kinda weird because on the Gamepad of Player1 the controlls were normal, on the 2nd one the controlls were COMPLETELY different... Jumping on [Y] and on... It was just weird and uncomfortable, that's why I decided to play the multiplayer on my own with controller for Player1 and Keyboard for Player2^^Well, Polarity was TOTALLY worth the 20cents (don't know if it was 20, could be 14 aswell^^) I bought it for.About 3 hours of fun^^ Well, the game is VERY easy, think that's why it took me less than 3 hours :DRECOMMENDED :3			",86,6,1,14,8,3,8

												A quite interesting first person puzzler slightly reminiscent of games such as Portal and the Talos Principle. Don't buy this game expecting that level of complexity or quality, but anything even slightly like Portal is a good thing, right? Right. One complaint, though: It doesn't use the feature the game is named after - the ability to switch your color to avoid or trigger certain pieces of geometry or lasers - nearly as often as it should. Anyway, you could do much worse for $5 and not a whole lot better for 19 cents, which is what I picked it up for during the Summer Sale.			",50,17,0,11,10,0,10

												The campaign and the bonus levels were great, the graphics were sub par, the puzzles were well thought out, and overall it's pretty fun. The horrible part is that, although it is advertised as multiplayer and local co-op, it is in fact only local co-op. This means that a part of the game was left untouched which is unsatisfying since I paid to enjoy the full game. A step forward for the developers would be an option for players to create their own levels and play with each other over the internet. Overall, good game but needs some fixing.			",13,0,0,1,3,0,0

												This game would be awesome if there is a online co-op, I really do not want to buy a Xbox 360 Controller for completing all co-op levels and achievements,But as a game, this is a perfect puzzle game. Not hard, not easy. Graphics are fine (except there are glitches and OOB bugs at Bonus Levels.) Sounds are acceptable, Mechanics are simple to understand.So, I really recommend this game.

												This game is actually fantastic. I bought it on sale intending to challenge it's self proclaimed brilliance as ""The best puzzle game since Portal"" After having completed the game I can say that while not as good as any of the Portal games Polarity's clever puzzles and addictive collectables kept my interest. It even has a local co-op mode with more puzzles which were fantastic. The only part of the game where I would say it lacked quality was the story in that it doesn't really exist and when it is there it seems kind of cheesy and out of place. There is also a competitive multiplayer mode that is not worth playing at all, but its inclusion did not hurt the game in my eyes. If you are looking for a brilliantly clever puzzle platformer in the vein of games like portal then look no further. It is absolutely worth the price.			",210,26,4,5,8,2,8

												While Polarity is not as great as Portal, Yet it's a very great game.The game itself has great graphics and level design, Instead of using the Portal Gun in portal, You use your Polarity... You can hack into Red and Blue beams by using your Polarity. This is quite an impressive feature to a game.The only problem with this game in my opinion is that it is WAY to easy. Remember in Portal when you had to receive a transmission to multiple radios to get an achievement? Well in this game, You collect Data Fragments. They are incredibly easy to find. No challenge whatsoever.If you're up for a challenge, Then this game is not for you. But if you like games with great graphics, fun levels, and easy gameplay, It's for you.My Rating: 7/10 ",24,4,0,0,2,0,1

												After 100% completing the single-player campaign (including the bonus levels) I do not recommend this game and here's why.-The puzzle designs are lazy and linear. I wouldn't even classify them as puzzles as they don't really get you thinking.-Even though the main mechanic of the game is that you can change your polarity, you suprisngly don't use it that often.  Not as often as you should. It felt like most of the puzzles used the cubes more than the core mechanic, and that got   boring fast.-Cubes. The physics weren't the best and elevators were the worst. Rising platforms (Elevators) would have a circle pad  in the middle to put a cube on to raise the platform. However if you fell off the platform you could not get the cube  off, so you'd have to go back to the beginning and reset the cube back to it's orginal position, and like I said before  since the puzzles revolved around them you would have to do whole entire levels again just because you fell.-At first I thought the data crytals were supposed to be secret, optional objects you would find in levels. But the hiding   places are so stupid. On one level there's a data crytal in a corner not being blocked by anything, just out in the open.  Another level has two of them next to each other. Because of how poorly they are hidden and that the last level requires  you to find all of them, I don't think they are optional.-The story doesn't make sense. You're a hacker hired by a hacking company. What does that have to do with puzzles?  Does the game take place in a computer? It doesn't explain.-At the beginning they explain some of the mechanics but later on whenever they introduce a new object they don't  bother explaining what it does. So good luck trying to find out what to do with a green laser field or a circle ramp.-If you thought Portal 1 was short, wait till you play this. I beat all the levels and got all the data  crystals in less than 2 hours. And it's sad because the game had so much potenial. The graphics were nice and the polarity mechanic was promising.Really, all I have to say about this game is that it is lazy. I give it a 4/10.If you still want to get the game after reading my review, wait for it to go on sale.			",47,13,0,11,10,0,8

A Screenshot of Polarity

If those three things were fixed, I could halfheartedly recommend this as a shallow, brainless diversion for about an hour.  I respect it might have been developed on a low budget, as it VERY heavily presents that fact with its... everything, really.  Sound effects, music, menu, level design, gameplay, all rather amateur.I used very rudimentary gaming skills and logic to very quickly clear the main campaign, and the bonus levels did not interest me.  Again, that's fine, but riding on the coattails of Portal WITHOUT EVEN HAVING PORTALS IN YOUR GAME while charging what I believe to be more than double the fair asking price and then being cheeky about ""fooling"" people with screenshots... leaves a very sour taste in my mouth.All things considered, I bought this a while back for 19 cents, thankfully.

												Polarity is a short and at times very easy puzzle game. It is in some ways comparable to portal, but without the portals. The main gameplay, at least, is similar to portal. You use cubes on pressure pads around each puzzle room, in an attempt to reach the exit. There is the added task of collecting data nodes, on the premise that you are a ""hacker"" stealing them from a vault. The story doesn't play too much into this except at the beginning and end of the game.The puzzles themselves are fairly easy. There were a few that I had to think about solving, but most were solvable in less than 2 minutes. For reference: I was even able to complete the co-op levels as a single player, and the entire game to 100% [with all data nodes collected] within ~3 hours.The music doesn't always play in this game, it fades in every now and then with a calming ambient piece. It is very nice, but I don't think there are many tracks that rotate. There isn't any voicing in this game, and beyond text that flashes on screen at the start of the game you are pretty much left to your own devices to figure things out. The graphics in this game are very nice. In some places the shadows look a bit odd, but mostly it looks nice. It has a sort of cell-shaded look, with textures that look fairly minimalistic.To summarise this: Despite peoples insistence to compare this to portal, beyond some similar gameplay mechanics it isn't very similar at all. It isn't overly challenging, but if you want some simple first-person puzzles to wile away an afternoon, this is the game to go for.			",171,91,5,6,15,0,12

It should be more like 0.50$ or f2p, there are alot of f2p titles that are doing a much better job then this game.			",83,10,2,3,6,1,1

												Would you love Portal if it weren't for all those annoying hours and hours of gameplay, immersive atmosphere elements, polished visuals, engaging characters, and tough challenges? Then this is the game for you! At $10, it certainly isn't the game for me.This game came in a bundle with a game I actually wanted, so I gave it a chance. In my 1.1 hours of playing, I have finished approximately 1/2 the single player content. Full disclosure: there are two cigarette breaks worth of time counted in that total when I wasn't actually playing.			",55,10,1,17,11,0,14

												I hate to be the barren of reviewing games i've played but I was expecting more out of this game. When I first saw this on Greenlight, I thought this could be the perfect alternative towards Portal & QUBE (because they don't work on my current laptop) but then I heard that this game was discounted at 96%! Hearing that must of made the game sound really bad but I ignored it. I read the description of Polarity, claiming that it's the most fun Puzzle game since Portal (I even saw a comment on the greenlight page that the dev(s) don't even know what Portal was). Gameplay was just too simple & it lasted only for an hour on my side, the first time playing Portal brought so much confusion that it was thrilling, this game just wanted me to go to sleep. I also looked around the levels set up & I saw so many flaws that it looked like it was rushed from development just to gain revenue. The worst part about it is that it has no decent story, Portal's story was so fasinating that I want to find out more about its connections with Half-Life 2, Polarity states that your a hacker thats trying to access a virtual vault when these levels don't look anything like a firewall. In conclusion, If you want a better puzzle game at a cheap price, Get something that was made perfectly & looks challenging (even if it has mixed ratings). All that it can be used now is to haul trading cards & allowing a short sleep mode onto yourself.			",28,0,0,2,4,1,0

												This is a rather interesting puzzle game and a must-have for fans of the genre, where you get hired by a hacking company to solve a bunch of puzzles and infiltrate a system to obtain some pieces of data, needless to say that the story is trivial but that's normally expected from a puzzle game.The puzzles are mildly difficult and only get a bit tricky in Co-op mode.In general, the game's visuals need a bit of polishing alongside some adjustments to the physics involving the player's movement, in addition to that, I had to restart a level from the beginning after dying on the edge of the level because I kept respawning outside of the level.And not forgetting that this game's store page has a Multiplayer tag when it actually only supports Singleplayer and Co-op modes. So, adding a Multiplayer feature would be great instead of just having the tag...But regardless of its flaws and after completing the game, I'd surely recommend it while hoping that the dev/devs will release some updates to both fix the issues mentioned above and to probably add more content to this nice game.

												This looks like a game with potential, but as it stands I found it pretty unplayable. Jumping simply doesn't work 80% of the time (you hear the jump noise but don't move), which is incredibly frustrating given this is a puzzle platformer. Gamepad sensitivity is also insanely high by default (although this can be turned down in the options thankfully - I had to set it to 0.1 to be usable). Gamepad button prompts are just missing entirely from some tutorial popups. The camera clips as you approach walls in co-op. If these bugs were addressed (and none of them seem like challenging issues) it would be a much more polished experience. I'm happy to change my recommendation if they're fixed in a patch.

												This game is like a reductive Portal (even their logos are similar, so you can clearly see the inspiration), but also brings something new to the table: you have to switch between the two polarities to be able to pass through gates and jump to platforms, which can require some quick thinking. I enjoyed it, but the co-op can only be played with a controller, so if you don't have one like me (I only have a PS2 one with no adapter), you can't get the last 3 achievements.

												Entertaining Portal-like puzzle game, without the humour and story line. Only complaints are that the game is a bit short and that it could be a little bit more difficult. Expect a relaxing playthrough with some headscratching though. I personally finished the single player campain and bonus levels in under 2 hours, all 100%.There is a co-op mode and versus mode too that requires the other player to play with a controller, or you can both play with a controller.  It would be nice to also have the option to play co-op online with random people.It would be amazing if this game had a workshop that allows people to create and publish their own levels.

Portal Except You Pay 99 Cents For It And It's Not Portal And There's No Memes. - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]When you look through the Steam bargain bin, you're most likely to find ♥♥♥♥.♥♥♥♥♥♥ copy-paste RPG's, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""My First Platformer"" games from some guy in his garage that thought he'd make it big on Steam with his ♥♥♥♥♥♥ wanna-be Super Meat Boy, or just plain actual ♥♥♥♥. Games that were hastily put together for a quick buck that hardly work but still sell because the trading cards.I bought a ton of these games, because I mean why not? During a Steam sale, this ♥♥♥♥ is like two cents. Everyone knows how large your ♥♥♥♥♥ is correlates to how many games you own on Steam. But this one game now, I was pleasantly surprised with.It's Portal. Portality. You know. The meme game. The one with the potato and the cakes and the lemons you squeeze in people's eyes.You might not recognize it, but that's only because this is the Walmart brand. This is Great Value: Puzzle Platformer. It has red and blue squares instead of circles. Also they're not portals. But it's like the same exact thing, honey. It's not Lucky Charms but there's a green man on the box. Eat your cereal.Portality barely manages to get by doing what Portal already did so much better. It has the puzzles in there. And there's different colors. Those do something. There's quite a bit of different elements to interact with, actually. Cubes that activate switches and launch pads and all kinds of ♥♥♥♥. The main function, your ""Polarity"", is purely titular though. You can switch between Red and Blue, and that changes which surfaces you can walk on or pass through. But it's introduced in the first few levels before all-but disappearing until the last few levels, bridged with cube puzzles and ♥♥♥♥.While playing through the 20 or so levels that made up the main ""story"", which by the way sucks ♥♥♥, all I could think to myself was ""wow, this game is a cluster♥♥♥♥"". A cluster♥♥♥♥ of puzzles. It's not put together the way Portal was. Portal was genius. Portal was all about portals and how many unique kinds of puzzles could be made with them. Everything always came back to using portals.Portality has all these ideas and it just throws them all at you at once. It's like you got drunk and picked up a chick you thought was way hotter at a club, then you wake up with her serving you breakfast in bed and asking what you want to name the baby before she goes dress shopping for your wedding.The feature that the game is named after gets shoved to the side for generic puzzle platforming that struggles to form a cohesive whole.It's a decent play, and has some good co-op features. It's definitely not a bad game. Off-brand Pringles are still Pringles. As long as they're not BBQ-flavored, they're still edible.It definitely passed the time, and there's a decent amount of content as long as you buy it on a sale when it's like 99% off. The game by itself regular price is 10 whole dollars. And that's clearly got to be some kind of elaborate joke, since I finished the game in a day and it wasn't even that great. It's not like it's particularly impressive graphically either. Generic Tron-♥♥♥, polygonal-♥♥♥ piece of ♥♥♥.There really is nothing but the gameplay itself to look forward to with this game. The presentation is incredibly basic, all the way down to the ""Conglaturation! You have completed a great game!"" message you get for earning 100% in the main game.There's really no narrative or story to what's going on. You're basically ""an elite hacker"" that has to ""hack things"". And all of the cubes you throw around are apparently inside a computer. And when you beat the game it says ""thank you for hacking everything"". That's it. Whoever wrote the plot to this also wrote Obama's Russian hacker story. There were Russian hackers. And everything is their fault. The end.Portal had some solid lore behind it. This game ain't got ♥♥♥♥. You can't even meme it. There's nothing to meme. There's no decent quotes. And a game without memes is absolutely worthless.Still, considering most of the stuff you find in the Steam dollar bin, it's not too bad. It's definitely functional, it's not 8-bit, and it has something of merit to look forward to, even if it's not exactly done as well as what it's copying.I honestly thought it'd be some cheap-♥♥♥ Tetris thing when I started it up the first time. All I saw were squares and thought ""well, this must be some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzle game"". But it was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3D puzzle game. That's nice.As far as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ discount games go, this is one of the best ones. They tried a little. It was good. I know most people only use Steam to play CS:GO, but if you ever think to yourself ""hey, I wonder if I can waste a dollar on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzle game"", look no further.			",156,15,0,29,5,0,7

												I've only logged .2 hours of playing time on the game but in that time, I felt compelled to write a review.  I cannot believe anyone would not recommend this game.First let me thank EQ Games for the free code out of the blue in my mailbox.  I had purchased on sale two others of their games and I guess this was just a thank you for that.  So far this is my favorite of the three so I can thank them enough.This game reminds me of other puzzle games like Portal and The Turing Test.  Both games I enjoyed immensely (well all 3 since there are 2 Portal games) and this is a very enjoyable and relaxing puzzle game that makes me feel smart once I figure out the puzzle.  So far, the puzzles have been easy and I’m hoping they get harder however even if they don’t it’s worth the cost to play.  (Right now, it’s on sale for 90% off) You may want to wait till it’s on sale to pick it up but still worth it at full price.It even has a nice story line to go along with the FPS puzzle solving that is interesting to start off with.  Maybe not as deep as the previous two mentioned games but still enough to make it worthwhile for the play through.  I look forward to playing the game more and if anything changes for me I’ll be sure to update this review.Oh, and I should mention that so far it seems to have full controller support.

Frankly put, this game is, at this point, only mediocre. And while it's fairly cheap, it's also fairly overpriced.

												Pros-Fun-Intresting mechanic-Not entierly straightforwardCons-Short-Not the best music-Polarity isn't implemented as much as I think it could have been.-the floors that kill you are sometimes hard to make out from the ones that don't.OverallI would not spend ten dolars on this game. However I caught it at 90% off. If you can get it at a low price, then I highly recomend it. This game was very fun. The learning curve was decent. There were no times when I had absolutly no idea what to do, but there were one or two times when it took me a minute of looking arond to figure out what I had to do. I like how you can get to the end of a level, but realise you have not colected all the data, causing you to have to backtrack. The one complaint I have about this game is that there are not enough levels. If this game were updated to have many more levels, better music, a slightly steeper learning curve, and some voice acting, I would pay ten bucks for it. But for what I got at $.99, I feel like I got my money's worth.			",33,2,0,4,4,0,1

												This game was alright in single player. It wasn't anything special, and not challenging at all. I burned through the single player and bonus levels with all of the data shards collected in just over an hour. Then we went through the coop in just over another hour with all of those shards. So 100% in around 3 hours. But my main gripe is that the game seemed to have trouble running smoothly in coop. I experienced frame lag all the time, and levels just stopped functioning. I had to play one of the levels 4 times because a platform wouldn't come down even without the power source. If you can get this game for bundle when it's on sale for under a dollar, get it only for Out There Somewhere. That game is amazing, while this is just filler to go along with it.

												Inspired by Portal with its own unique twists.Polarity is like Portal, but with hidden data around each level for you to find, some simple and others are a lot more tricky. The gameplay has its own unique take on the whole orange portal blue portal. You have red and blue, for negative and positive. You must use them in certain ways to progress maps and not die. Its simple gameplay and can be interesting if your lookin for more casual gameplay. No campaign or story, so if you care about that this game isn't for you.The game has bonus levels for when your done the main stages. They add some more difficulty and more mechanics to deal with. The full game can be completed in around 6 hours, more if your going for the full completion. I personally wouldn't spend 5$ on this game, but if you wait for a sale you can get it for 0.50$.

												Basically this game is too short and easy if you are looking for a challenging first person puzzler. There's vibes of Portal and Qube with this red/blue polarity mechanic that can be found in fairly more competent titles like Outland or Ikaruga. Physics can get kinda bugged in places too, primarily cubes that can be moved might fall through moving platforms and get stuck around corners. This game feels more like a proof of concept than a concrete game. 20 very short levels for single player that you can finish in 60 minutes or so. There's some stuff for 2 players too. Its not a terrible game per se, just do not pay the full price for it. I'll give this one a no because it left me craving for so much more.			",494,151,16,70,53,4,106

												Polarity is a short puzzle game which, (Like a lot of puzzle games) has you move cubes from point A to point B most of the time, using some kind of game mechanic.Still reading? Okay!In Polarity you are able to.. Switch polarities which is visualized by you changing between Blue and Red.This leads into some pretty straight forward thinking:Red passes through Red.Blue passes through Blue.This is what most of the puzzle will be based around with you using cubes to power things like jump pads or opening doors to progress and gets a bit trickier as you go further into the game.However here is the reason why I'm giving this a negative review:For as fun and interesting this concept is and with the possiblities it has.. The levels in the game itself are rather easy.This could be because I have played many puzzlers before but I think to even people that are new to games this may be pretty straight forward even for them.That is my biggest issue with that game, Not challenging level design.Though there are a couple more things that irk me:    -The visuals are pretty bad for a game released in 2014. (I did not check if this game existed long before the Steam release)    -There is not much music. Only a couple of tracks in the game that change every level but you'll hear the same track multiple times.    -Some things with the physics don't feel smooth or right.All these things can be negated though if this game was more of a proof of concept.Is this worth 10,99€ or your regional equivalant? Nope.. Though may be fun for a little bit. Also has co-op so you can enjoy a small game with a friend. Get it when it's cheap... Really cheap!			",303,32,2,13,14,5,6

												It was a game I got for a dollar, and that's about what it is worth. It's a simple and nice game amde by some guy in the middle of the night. At least that's what I remember the game disclaimer being. It fully said that, and I enjoyed the dev ammiting this was just some side project he made. The thing is some shady stuff happened. I noticed there was an update for it today, so I went to check what it was. There were no new news, so I checked here. And, there's now bundles, which used to be nonexistent. I'm very sad that this stuff has happened. :C Welp, time to see the new ""update""			",57,2,0,0,2,0,2

												I found this puzzle game to be fun for about an hour. The sound track is nice but the puzzles are relatively easy and they dont last a long time. It feels that the game is trying it's best to be like protal but their isn't enough content in the game to play for hours on end like portal. Do I recomend this game. Yea I do but only if you have $10 to spare for about and hour of enjoyment, just to fine disappiontment at the end.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a decent puzzle game. It brears great similarity to portal. However I've got to say the puzzles arent near as clever and interesting as portal. I averaged about 3.5 minutes per puzzle and finished both the main game and the bonus in under 2 hours. I have not tried the multiplayer components though.I'll say it is pretty fun and somewhat interesting and well worth a few dollars for a short game. This may seem like a disservice to the developer who im sure put an insane amount of time into the game. Clever puzzles are really REALLY hard to make. But clever is required for an engaging puzzle as well.			",11,7,0,9,8,0,11

												Polarity is a fun game.

												This is a great game overall, very Portal-esque in it's design and in how it plays, but one feature I would like to see is online Co-op. This is because although this game already has a Co-op and vs mode, they're only local multiplayer, and it's generally easier to play both of those game modes in a online version. Once that's done we have ourselves a great, fun game.			",175,27,0,21,8,1,3

												Basically this game is too short and easy if you are looking for a challenging first person puzzler. There's vibes of Portal and Qube with this red/blue polarity mechanic that can be found in fairly more competent titles like Outland or Ikaruga. Physics can get kinda bugged in places too, primarily cubes that can be moved might fall through moving platforms and get stuck around corners. This game feels more like a proof of concept than a concrete game. 20 very short levels for single player that you can finish in 60 minutes or so. There's some stuff for 2 players too. Its not a terrible game per se, just do not pay the full price for it. I'll give this one a no because it left me craving for so much more.			",494,151,16,70,53,4,106

												This puzzle game is very similar to the Portal games, except that in Polarity, you don't have a portal gun, you have the option of changing your ""polarity"" from blue to red, and red to blue. You must use your polarity changing abilities to maneuver abstacles such as lasers, gates, bridges, and more. For example, depending on the color of a laser, you either can get through it, or you cannot. If it were a blue laser, you would have to change your polarity to blue to get through, and if it were red, you would have to change your polarity to red.The story is a bit awkward, considering this game is an intricate puzzle game with blocks and jumping around, being a hacker trying to get data from a computer network is not a very fitting story.Another thing I wanted to mention was that for me, personally, the pricetag of $15 is asking a bit too much, as I would say $10 or less is a more reasonable price, but since I picked this game up during the 2015 Summer Sale, I cannot complain because I paid 19 cents.Overall, this is a great game, with puzzle elements similar to the Portal games, and other unique elements, but the price is asking a bit too much for what it is, and the story does not fit this game very well.I would recommend this game to anyone who wouldn't mind selling two trading cards for this 19 cent game (when it is on sale).

So if you're looking for coop puzzle, look for it elsewhere. And co-op is not online :)Can only reccomend this only if you want to get your perfect and completitionist score higher, and if you don't to then don't waste your time.			",898,349,23,70,87,9,120

												Polarity is fun mainly because it gives off that portal vibe but it lacks a few stuff that would make the game way better and worth Ten dollars .things such as :user created levels , make levels harder and more levelsAt the state the game is in now its not worth ten dollars and should  be brought down to a euro (One dollar)			",40,2,0,1,3,0,0

												This game has a cool concept, however the campaign and bonus levels are short and require no brains at all.  Maybe 1 hour max to complete all levels.  Multiplayer doesnt work cause it is local only... on a computer... pfft.  However for 19 cents, you might as well pick it up and get your hours worth.			",68,5,1,6,6,2,4

												""Polarity"" is a first-person 3D puzzle platformer that has a few interesting mechanics. However, it suffers from a number of very visible flaws. The graphics are bland and mediocre. The music and sound effects are poor. The level design is generally simple and dull, giving players little motivation to explore the co-op mode or the bonus levels.Despite the description, this game is a far cry from games like Portal. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game even if it comes with some very cheap bundles unless you are looking for cheap sources of Steam Trading Cards.			",45,14,0,9,3,0,3

												Wow, this game is bad. In every way. A friend gifted it to me, and after a few levels, I assumed it was some kind of special fundraising game, like a high school kid's senior project that was paying for his cancer treatment or something. Nope. It's an actual attempt at a professional game from a ""professional"" studio. They're trying to charge $15 for it.Have you played Portal? OK, imagine if you removed the clever basic idea, and substituted a much stupider and boring idea instead. (There are two kinds of walls, red and blue, and you can press a button to switch between one color or the other. Don't forget to press that button, or you won't be able to go through the right colored walls!)Now, remove the quality textures and lighting. Make the controls super muddy and unresponsive. Oh, get rid of all that profession voice action. Actually, get rid of all characters entirely. Yeah, just your third-person camera and some blank walls. That's the ticket!OK now hide the mission objectives behind some of those blank walls so that the player can't find them. No, not the red and blue ""polarity"" walls, that would seem like you're trying to design a half-♥♥♥♥♥ puzzle. Just literally HIDE them where they can't be found unless a player goes searching along every single blank wall in the game in hopes of finding a hidden crevice where you stuck one.Voila! You have designed ""Polarity""!* Do not, under any circumstances, pay money for this game.* Do not buy someone this game as a gift, even if it's on sale for 90% off, as it is at the time of this writing. It is not worth $1.50.* Do thank your friend for the thought if they buy this game for you (it really was a nice idea!). Immediately delete it from your library. They didn't know what they were doing.-----Stage 8 gets a special mention for exceptionally poor level design. My GOD this game is awful.			",33,32,0,12,4,1,11

												Polarity is a top down, third person, action, adventure, open world shooter game set in the beautiful country of england. In polarity the main protangonist has to go through endless chucky cheese arcades till he gets to the end of the country. In this game there will be possible gore if turned on in the settings and should be rated M for mature because of the emotional rollercoaster from both the story and art style of the game. The protagonist needs to follow the trails of cheese puff crumbs on the ground to find out who kidnapped his wife and why. The story is full of twist and turns and needs a solid heart yet brave soul to complete those who do not possess these qualitys will not have a fun time playing this game as the the feeling and joy behind the game is hidden in its story which I must say is breath taking. I dont remember a game that has made me feel the same as way as Roblox. What more do you want this game has a very well developed story with a heart breaking ending, graphics that rival next gen titles such as the witcher 3 and is a bang for your buck game.11/10 best game since Backugan Battle BrawlersEdit: Nov 23 2016 - Still best game I have ever played			",62,3,0,3,2,1,2

												My Rating7/10SingleplayerI enjoyed the full game and I feel like it would be fun to speedrun sometime too. You may need to backtrack sometimes because you need to collect 3 items called Data on every level. Longest time out of all the levels for me to complete was around 5 minutes and an average level took me around 1-2 minutes.Co-opThis game only has local co-op so I played it by myself and the last few levels were a nightmare because I had to use a controller and keyboard + mouse at the same time, still fun, but took me longer due to not having another friend though.Worth Buying?Get this when it is on sale! I got this during the Developer Alliance Bundle was on sale for $1.49 and I felt like it was a good bargain. For the actual price of $9.99, not so much (Perhaps if it were $2.99 or less?).

												It’s not ground breaking or anything but just OK.Story:You’re a “hacker” that needs to collect “data fragments” in all the levels. Since when did we let Cave Johnson design security systems? IDK. Basically no story.Gameplay:It’s a puzzle platformer. Think portal except portal and more throwing blocks at switches. The puzzles basically involve launch pads, switches, and platforms. There is one component where you switch between red and blue “state?”. The point of this is that you can pass through walls of your own color but not the opposite. This is well used as it also incorporates floors and platforms meaning you have to really think about your next step. There are 11 levels + 10 bonus (why not just make the bonus part of the normal levels idk) so it’s short but It does have coop.Graphics/Performance: (with a 970, 4790K, 16GB of RAM, SSD)The game looks simplistic and the performance remains at 60 solid. The music is not bad as it never gets in the way and isn’t noticeably bad.Final Thoughts:Overall, it’s not amazing or groundbreaking but not that bad.			",188,42,0,10,8,0,29

												Short little game with simple puzzles. Even though the maps are clunky made and cubes sometimes dissapear if you throw them at walls, its designed in a way that you wont get stuck. The ideas like switching colours to go through walls and power up ramps that let you choose which way they face have potential, but they dont get complex at all. It has a co-op mode, but only local. Not bad for a game made between work hours, even though it could benefit from the steam workshop.If you played portal and the like you can spend ~1€ to have 1-1.5 hours of cute puzzling.

												Mysteriously got this for free while registering some other game.  I hear this game gets around and with few achievements, I was looking forward to reviewing this particular title.I'm going to start by saying I respect what this developer was trying to accomplish AND that I enjoyed this title.  Polarity is Portal when you want to portal, but don't wanna portal enough to play Portal.  If GLaDOS wasn't your cup of tea, but you enjoyed the gameplay of Portal, then Polarity will continue your experience, only without portals and with a new polarity mechanic.Play as a nameless hacker and reach the end of the stage via color-cube / switch puzzles based on polarity of the cubes and of your own aura.  The story demands that you collect the collectibles in the stage, but you can enjoy the stages while hunting for the items later if you please.  The polarity mechanic is pretty fun and innovative.What's disappointing about this title, however, is that it's pretty short (About Portal's length of 1.5 hours if you're hunting the items).  There's also the aspect of the lack of ONLINE Coop, which some titles on Steam seem to neglect.  It has local coop, but I feel it's more fun to have an online coop thrown in.  Additionally, the cubes you get can fall through floors/walls and get stuck in cubes/walls.  These cubes have also been able to dislodge themselves from your grip as you land on some platforms.   My final complaint is in the ""Lift"" jumps.  Jump off a lift and you go propelling in the direction you're headed (moreso than you'd think, which makes it disorienting).In the end, I'll admit that I had fun.  Do I recommend it?  Of course.   Do I recommend it at full price ($10)?  No.  Wait for a sale, bundle, giveaway, or for it to conveniently find its way to you as it's been known to do.  I hear that it's had 99% off discounts before, so try to nab it at that price.  Otherwise, I'd recommend a price of about $1-2.50.7/10  Innovative and fun, but overpriced and in need of polishing.  Not as polished as Portal, but a nice substitute.			",257,76,12,21,24,7,23

												Seems like the developer played Portal and got waaaaay too excited to make their own ~exciting first-person puzzle platformer with sterile environments!!~ As it is, the titular mechanic (being able to swap your ""polarity"" between red and blue, and using this to phase through obstacles of the same color) is used very little, and the only difficulty it adds to the game is trying to swap polarities in midair for platforming purposes. (By the way, first-person platforming is really not enjoyable, especially when the controls handle very poorly.) Indeed, the only challenging puzzle in the entire 90 minutes worth of single-player content, found in Bonus 04, doesn't involve the polarity mechanic at all. It DOES involve lots of clipping, very questionable cube physics (there's no friction between them and moving platforms? pressing a rotate button when they're not in the rotating area makes them fly into the air???), and a plot that's not worth the 20 seconds it takes to click through the expository slideshow. Only buy this game in a bundle, like I did, or if it's 20 cents and you're super desperate for ""puzzle"" games.			",89,10,1,6,2,1,15
