												Since playfire rewards made me play this piece of... worthless software again, it reminded me just how terrible this game is, so I thought why not review this and help potential victims avoid it.If I had to describe this game in one sentence, it would be - demands perfection, doesn't offer precision.The game tries to be an electro version of super meat boy, and while the music is fine and likable, the controls are just awful, everything feels very stiff, and unresponsive. The levels are by far the worst thing in this game, they are not built for speedrunning or fluent platforming at all, in fact I think they created a set of levels that were perfect for a game of this type, and then they just inverted them totally to make them this bad, they are just atrocious. Also levels sort of ""react"" to the music - traps spring up quicker when faster music is playing... trust me it makes things even worse when you are achievement hunting as the ingame playlist is randomised and you can't lock it to a certain track that would actually allow a human being to beat a level in time for an achievement. Another HUGE minus would be that every time you restart a track, there is a stupid unnecessary 3 second long countdown till you get to play.If you want an x/10, i'd give it a 4, only because of the decent music, but seriously, if you are looking for games like super meat boy, avoid this.

												Upon starting the full retail version of the game you are greeted with a EULA for what is stated to be the DEMO VERSION of the game that includes some truly pernicious terms of service and also some plainly rude language telling the customer that if you try any funny business you will incur a bunch of legal costs through arbitration, also it is unclear about the scope and nature of the data collection the game will be doing or why a simple platformer needs to store any personal information about me on an out of country server in the first place. I don't think I have ever seen a EULA that looks quite this bad before. So I was like ""is it just me, or is this ♥♥♥♥ unusually oppressive?"" and I did some googling and the thing shows up on game review sites. Apparently I am not the only person who thought it was kind of weird.http://www.game-debate.com/articles/index.php?a_id=2096&game=Rush%20BrosIf the product can't even clarify whether I am agreeing to one for the full version of the game I just purchased or if instead I have just installed some sort of demo version, I am certainly not going to accept any agreement that looks like this.

												The concept intrigued me, but the execution fails like mad in this game, where the order of the day is less on platformer skill and more on memorization - if you do not a) locate and b) precisely follow the 'correct' route every stage, you are not hitting the time trial goals, and if you're not playing to hit the time trial goals, there is, as far as I can tell, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to this game. Aside from playing against a friend (or random people who can drop-in from Steam, which is a decent enough feature), there's really no reward or drive to keep playing that I can tell. All(? there are 47 I want to say) stages are unlocked from the beginning and... I dunno. I wanted this to be good and it let me down.			",2440,960,88,309,285,27,386

												Rush Bros… Oh my, where to begin.It’s incredibly rare that I come across a game so absolutely, irredeemably awful I’m forced to leave it after a mere twenty minutes. That’s a shockingly short amount of time to spend on a video game, free or not. And yet, Rush Bros manages to be that rare kind of awful. I honestly think that the developer was actively trying to scare people away from their game. The menu alone is enough indication of that.Let me break down the basics of just what exactly Rush Bros is for you. You are one of two “Rush Bros”, your goal being to get from one end of a 2D level to the other. So, yes, it’s a platformer. But wait, there’s more! The game’s claim to fame (can we even call it that?) is that your music library (or, if you’re too lazy to actually point the game at your music files like me, the set of techno that comes packaged in) determines the way the levels play out and react. Cool, right? Yeah, that sounds great! I get to listen to my music, and it changes how the game works! Wow!Well, unfortunately, very wrong. This feature is barely used for anything but a spike or two popping up and out of the floor every few beats, or a lever that needs to be pulled on the beat (a mechanic which, by the way, is very poorly explained). It’s incredibly lame, and it means that Rush Bros is nothing more than a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ platformer with some funky tunes.Now that we’ve established Rush Bros is completely devoid of originality, let’s talk about the graphics. They’re bad. And I mean really ♥♥♥♥ing bad. Once again, it manages to be that one breed of terrible that not only assaults your eyes with character animations which look to have been haphazardly assembled in flash by a sixth-grader who just figured out how key-framing and looping works, but it also has the audacity to apply filters to the entire image which, after only five minutes, will leave you with a piercing headache. Think Max Payne 3’s most egregious examples of cutscene visual tomfoolery, except constant, always there to taunt your eyes with what could have been clarity instead of a bloom-addled, disco-infused fever dream.Oh, and of course, the controls. Or rather, what controls? This game has controls? Could’ve fooled me, because the first 10 minutes of my time with it was spent trying to figure out why the hell I couldn’t move my character around the screen, at all. Well, as it turns out, unlike most other (well put-together) games, Rush Bros completely ignores the fact that you’ve plugged in a controller when you actually begin playing it (despite the fact it works 100% properly in the menus you use to actually take you to the “play” portion of the game). Yes, you have to manually bind the controller to the actions you want your character to complete despite the fact it tells you right from the get-go “Hey, we made this game for controllers! You should use one!” Well, are you sure you made this game for controllers, XYLA Entertainment? Because from where I stand, that really doesn’t seem to be the case.Once you actually get running, it quickly dawns on you that everything about the running, jumping, positioning, and wall-grabbing in this game is completely off. Jumps seem to inconsistently propel you varying distances, movement is so floaty it’s impossibly difficult to land on a jump pad that takes up nearly 20% of the screen real-estate, and the speed at which your character slides down walls when he grabs them will have you wondering if he’s composed of primarily molasses. I cannot tell you how many times in the mere 20 minutes I spent with this steaming turd I died due to the horrific controls.Oh, and don’t even get me started on how hard it is to actually start playing the game in the first place. I still haven’t been able to figure out how any of it works, since when trying to select the singleplayer stages, I kept getting requests to join the games of others. And you know what, I don’t blame those who spammed me with the intrusive offers, either. Hell, I’m sure I did the same, because despite the fact that I’m very obviously trying to play singleplayer through the singleplayer-labelled Arcade menu option, the game seemed to love pairing me up with total randies from the boundless realm of “The Internet”. I’m still not sure if I managed to get into the singleplayer at all, actually, seeing as how every time I finished a stage the game showed me the statistics of an unnamed, invisible second “player” who never seemed able to finish the level before me. Or maybe the game was just unable to identify that I was playing alone, which seems far more plausible.Credit where credit’s due, the in-game soundtrack (read: not the one you import) is actually pretty good. I enjoyed the techno tunes included, and must admit it’s mostly because of them I even stuck around long enough to get past the first few levels (which are only about 30 seconds each, by the way). However, whatever algorithm the developer is using to apply the “beat” to the in-game geometry is flaky at best, since it always seems to speed-up or slow-down completely at random. Hey guys: if the feature you’ve touted as revolutionary and unbelievably innovative for the platforming scene doesn’t even work with the music you tested and included it with, I think there may be an issue somewhere. But hey, I’m no programmer, so what do I know… right?To sum things up, this game is awful. Why I even dedicated a whole 1010 words to it is actually beyond even myself. Stay away from it (not that you honestly ever intended to buy it) and spend that cash elsewhere. I’m just glad I got this smear for free.			",248,24,6,17,12,0,13

												Rush Bros attempts to marry the minimalistic, highly difficult platforming of games such as Super Meat Boy and I Want To Be The Guy, with the music generating gameplay of Beat Hazard or Audiosurf while putting a heavy focus on multiplayer. Unfortunately it fails abysmally at being comparable in even one of these aspects, with almost every feature going against the basic concepts it tries to establish, resulting in a game that I could barely force myself to play.The problems with the platforming star with the controls. Your character feels as if he's made of putty, plodding along at anything but a rush and sticking to walls like glue. This is a problem firstly because the entire game is based around speedruns which become almost impossible to pull off when movement is akin to running molasses and are you're character is constantly getting stuck on the environment. Secondly, because the level designs haven't been tweaked to compensate for this slowness, with much faster hazards and gaps that are virtually impossible should you miss a speed or double jump powerup.On top of being frustrating to navigate, the levels or to be more accurate, tracks are chock full of tedious backtracking which often sends you all the way to the start of the level after you grab a key or open a door. Checkpoints are also a point of contention as there is no rhyme or reason as to their placement or even inclusion. Some tracks feature nearly endless checkpoints before every obstacle, others without a single one to speak of which needless to say vastly changes the difficulty level.Although it's clearly the main focus, Rush Bros manages to somehow be even worse in multiplayer games do to the completely unbalanced powerups that randomly pop up during play. Once again it goes against the core speedrunner mentality, instead resorting to unnecessary gimmicks that cheapen the thrill of winning a match. The final aspect is the use of custom soundtracks to change and augment tracks, but it is so inconsequential and often unnoticable that it's hardly worth mentioning. The actual music that is included is of a suitably low quality, and the graphics are incohesive with each background seemingly plucked at random from the user generated reject of other games.I had high hopes for Rush Bros, and even after playing it feel the concept of a music generated platformer has a lot of potential, but the execution here falls apart with every lazy step it takes. Though it's becoming exceedingly rare for me to play a game where I cannot find even a single redeeming quality to latch onto, but Rush Bros truly does nothing of note and there is no reason I would advise anyone to play it, not even for novelty's sake.

												If Super Meat Boy and Jet Grind Radio had twins, they would be the Rush Bros. This precision platformer starring two feuding brothers doesn’t just test your jumping skills, but does so while throwing a ton of bright colors at you and using an awesome soundtrack to make every death seem like a good thing. While you may want to be frustrated as a gamer, as a person, you can’t help but be glad since it lets you listen to more music! It’s a brilliant way to make a game fun at its most challenging moments.Its classification as a racing/platformer may seem a bit confusing at first, but when you play the game, the term makes a lot of sense. Rush Bros. is a time trial-focused game with a side focus on beating stages with as few deaths as possible. Obstacles in your path aren’t just the usual platforms, springs, and spikes, but also things like rock-out stations that require rapid button presses to get through quickly or else you’ll add precious seconds to your time. It’s always tempting to blame poor performance on controls, but they work really well in Rush Bros., so that’s never an issue. Keyboard support is available, but controllers are recommended literally before the title screen hits — so play with one if at all possible. Most importantly for a precision platformer, the controls are responsive. Visually, this is a jaw-dropping game. The sharp color on black outline characters make for a nice contract with the game’s environments, which tend to be bathed in color. Beyond the usual things like space-themed and forest backdrops, there are even some with creepy faces all around them. There’s no sense of sameness with the look of levels, and the  use of little color trails for power-ups only adds to the visual overload. Animations are a bit simplistic, but that’s never much of an issue with this game, or many others really, since that makes it easier to predict your own movements.The dubsteb/dance soundtrack is incredible and among the most catchy I’ve heard in a long time.The traditional sound effects of boinks and the like for jumps and springs work well, and managed to fit the genre while clearly making sure that the music is the star of the show. If you don’t like the default soundtrack, you can always customize it. At a mere $10 on Steam, Rush Bros. offers up a lot of fun for very little money. Anyone who loves precision platformers will enjoy it quite a bit, as will fans of dance music, as the OST is full of it and it’s all good stuff.Rush Bros. came out of nowhere, but is a very polished game worthy of any gamer’s time.

												Basically, the game is simple and based a bit on skill and reflexes. In addition, the music is also not bad but that's a matter of taste. The maps are well designed and the control you get used very easily. Multiplayer, local co-op mode, steam cloud, and controller-support is offered. For 10 € a bit expensive but if it is on offer can afford each. My conclusion: Rush Bros can be a lot of fun, but it is a game which is not too versatile.			",14,0,1,0,2,0,2

												Rush Bros. Is basically what it says in the game desc. A fast pasted platformer. Although I normally avoid platformers because they cause rage most the time to me and others I got this due to me meeting the dev. of this game. He also said there would be a hat with it in tf2 called the fuzzy wub wub that never came out, o well. Anyways this games level design changes with whatever music you put in it, causing some obstacles to move faster or slower depending on what music is playing and when the base drops in the song. Of course like i said that does cause lots of confusion and makes it so you normally die 15~100 times depending on map and if there is a checkpoint system in the map you chose. Luckily deaths are fast and they spare no time throwing you back out there to continue. All in all this game gives you enough fun for its price and its fun to play with friends and share your music with them. I'd give it... 6.75/10 I think. Gives you enough fun for your buck. (I'd recomend getting it while it is on sale during winter or summer. Although it is fun I can't see to many people playing it over 4 hours.)			",177,44,1,18,9,2,11

												Awhile back I wrote a review for this game. I thought about it and then I thought, ""Wow, this is bad."" After thinking about it some more, I cannot reccomend Rush Bros. Why? First off, the controls are pretty laughable. Standard fare of jump, action. But one thing that I didn't expect was the slide button. Basically, you press it and you get a speed boost while sliding. You know what that means! SPAMMING TIME. Falling off of edges isn't uncommon. I bought a two pack to play with a friend, multiplayer is fun for 5 matches, then it gets boring and repetitive. You can also put your pirated mp3's into the soundtrack. The only thing it changes is how fast the map can do things like, throw obstacless at you, make conveyor belts more annoying, etc. I will admit that the original soundtrack is good. But, if you need a rhythm game to play, just get BIT.TRIP Runner or Osu!			",79,33,4,16,11,0,3

												We spent 2 hard, long years developing Rush Bros. and our biggest weakness right now is word-of-mouth. We're trying to do everything we can to make Rush Bros. known. It's a hard-core racing game which can be enjoyed by both casual players and dedicated speed-runners. The philosophy behind the game is: Play the way you want to. When you're on a playground you don't normally declare the rules before everyone jumps in a sandbox. By the time you get there somebody is probably already making sande castles. Then somebody screams ""The Floor is Lava"" and things get really interesting. Rush Bros. is themed around this kind of play- this more organic make-up-the-rules-as-you-go-along kind of play. This is a hard concept for some people to understand because it's something more natural / organic and less structured. If anything else Rush Bros. is an experiment with how you can allow your players to design the rules for how the game is played while they are playing it. You choose what levels to play on, you choose the win condition (Cross Finish Line Together Vs. There's One Obvious Winner - Or some other condition based on applied Remixes / Mutators ). On top of all this we've also got some great music dedicated by fans as well as some awesome bands like Infected Mushroom, Xilent, Matt Larsen, and many others. I strongly suggest you give it a try! If you're in to speed-running then this is really your cup of tea, trust me.			",209,51,3,14,13,4,20

												Rush Bros is a pretty addicting race platformer, which lets you race against friends or other people on the internet. It is challenging, but far from impossible.First of, this game has a main gimmick: music. You can import your own music into this game or just play one of the music within the game as background music for the stage. The fun thing is that Rush Bros applies your music to the stage. Some obstacles, including spikes and pillars, go along with the beat of your song. That means that it can be used in your advantage or in your disadventage. When you are playing online though, the opponent has his own music, and therefore also his own obstacles.As I've said before, Rush Bros is a challenging game. But that is mainly for the achievement hunters or the competitive online players. Whenever you die, you respawn just before the point of death. You have infinite lives, so you don't have to worry about dieing. This also goes for online play.Me, being a speedrunner, absolutely love the stage designs and eventually reach the goal as fast as possible. I myself do not care much for achievements, but it's a nice aim nonetheless.However, this game is mainly for online play. If you don't have anyone to play with, this game is less fun than it is supposed to be. Also, you might want to use a controller, as it is clearly not made for keyboard use.Rush bros is a fun and entertaining game, but I would advice buying this game when it is on sale. Otherwise, it is not worth it.			",304,66,16,55,23,1,21

It tries to mimic other great platformers however it horribly fails to do so by giving you and un-fun and minimalistic challenge of running across an empty space without power ups only to get a better score than another player. On top of that the game is filled with bugs, I often found myself challenging other players to a race when I clearly selected that I wanted to race alone.

												Rush Bros is a interesting platformer with a couple of cool concepts. But tries too much by using conflicting concepts. The game would be better as two separate games that only use the concepts that support each other together. Because it tries to be a speedrunner where you can run against each other or alone against time. But also have different styles of level designs almost each level. Most levels you need to backtrack for keys. That's fine but not when you're speed running. The randomness of the level reacting on the music is also goes against the speedrunning. And you have some trail and error dead traps in the level design.The controls feel a bit off in the beginning and I think it's because of the stickiness when you wallslide. In most games where you can walljump the wallslide is fast but here it's really slow. And it's counter intuitive to the speed running. It's really annoying and I don't get why they made it like this.I really want this game to live up to it's potential. The music is great and the art style is pretty cool. It just isn't working as a speed running game. If you just play too casually complete the levels it's fine. But the whole racing against each other and time just doesn't work for this game because the developers wanted too much. It could have been an amazing platformer like Super Meat Boy or Electric Super Joy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After playing the game more to give it further analysis here are my thoughts.The game is ""okay"" but not worth anything more than $2 because of how boring and stale it feels. It often tries to tote itself as a precision platformer but fails to deliver on adequate platforming. The jumping feels awkwardly clunky and more often than not you will end up falling because it doesn't recognise input for more than 100ms which is unacceptable. The game falls off and the level design is interesting but the platforming mechanics feel weighted and not precise at all. My biggest gripe with the game is that it often tried to get me to play against other players in a race before I have even played a level, I would toggle off this option and immediately after a race it would re-enable it; If I wanted to play multiplayer I would have chosen that option from the main menu. ProsInteresting level designBeautiful backdropsConsMusic is annoyingly intrusive Clunky platformingAnnoyingly integrated versusArt that resonates with music felt off beat and distractingThe game has interesting ideas but fails to execute effectively and in a way that isn't frustrating for the player. The seamless multiplayer is nice but its lack of remembering when I had toggled it off quickly became annoying. I found myself muting the game to not have to listen to the music. The game was interesting but there have been plenty of game available for cheaper (even free) that I would avoid this and look for something else.I would have to rate the game a 3/10			",367,97,7,29,24,2,30

												Absolute crap platformer masquerading around as a time-attack super meat boy clone. Moving obstacles change speed depending on whether you're moving or not, and controls are unresponsive, making your character seem sluggish and unpolished. Rush Bros. feels more like a beta release than a full game.Oh, and who sets online versus mode as the default on first install?

												Honestly Rush Bros. looked really promissing when I saw the trailer and I was really excited to play it but after getting my hands on it I can safely say that pretty much the only thing the game has going for it is the soundtrack and even that may not appeal to some people. Visuals, level design and animation quality is something to be desirable on Rush Bros and story is pretty much non existent. The game might be fun if you play with someone else but playing it alone, as I did, will probably be a waste of your time. Even if you're a fan of platformers I doubt that you'll have fun with this one on yourself, playing with a friend might give you somewhat a good time and probably some giggling when someone dies but I honestly don't recommend Rush Bros. in any circunstances.

												The only reason I bother to download and play Rush Bros was to get the achievements. A lot of them seemed simple enough. Finish this level in under a certain amount of time to unlock the achievement and what not. What I didn't realize is that in order to get the achievement, a person would have to be nearly perfect to obtain it which was made difficult by the fact that the obstacles were set to the rhythm of the music in the game making it extremely inconsistent. This made achievement hunting more unbearable and annoyed me to no end when the controls in game were unresponsive at times. If anything, Rush Bros tries to copy Super Meat Boy and the like with a musical element added which ruins the overall gameplay. I'd avoid this title unless you like dubstep or want to give this to someone you want to really annoy. Overall Score: 3/10			",980,281,47,146,96,9,176

												Edit from the future: A patch came out that said they've fixed the achievement bugs. I don't want to play this game anymore, but at least they fixed the stability issues that I've complained about in this review.Original review:===First the good stuff: amazing music. I would recommend paying for the OST.Now for the bad: Its buggy. I have been trying to get the ""No death"" achievement on the ""Spikes Everywhere"" level. It is hard enough, but when I was able to complete the run, I did not get the achievement.Tried it again (wasn't easy and took many tries) and I still didn't get it.  Found a solution online that said to restart steam. I did and I tried again. I got the speedrun achievement (I've gotten very good at this level). I was able to get a no death run a little while later and guess what, it did not register. After ~2 hours of playing, I gave up. I know that I got the achievement, I don't need steam to tell me I got it.Tl;dr: Get it for the OST, not recommended for doing record runs.			",278,113,2,36,18,4,26

												The idea behind Rush Bros. is that the platforming you do is affected by your music. And that very well may be the case if they fix a few key issues. Having played only a short amount of this game, I have some first impressions;- Menus are cluttered and messy. I found myself accidentally restarting levels instead of moving on to the next one because I    couldn't easily see what was going on in the menus. When you pause a level, it auto selects ""return to main menu"" and makes you scroll down to ""back to game"" (doesn't sound like a huge issue, but it's a pointless problem). What's most infuriating is that the options are unavailable within a game. I repeat; in a MUSIC BASED GAME, you have to return to the main menu to CHANGE THE MUSIC VOLUME. I cannot stress how backwards that is.- Animations are... off. I can't really describe it. From the screenshots, you would imagine that the game plays and looks a certain way. But the animations are... jarring. The graphics are also somewhat confusing, with some obstacles killing you despite looking exactly the same as some that don't.- No sense of speed. You move quite slow. I imagine speeding up the character would help the game.- Music should impact more. All it does is change the speed of the character's headbob and some of the background.All in all, the game doesn't really live up to what it wants to be. And that's a shame. ",222,48,8,13,16,3,17

There seems to be some kind of story from watching the intro, but when you start the game - surprise, there is no story to be had. Gameplay is tedious and you're just bouncing back and forth, falling down long tubes and having to jump back up again, fetching ""keys"" to advance in the level you're currently in.

												If Super Meat Boy and Jet Grind Radio had twins, they would be the Rush Bros. This precision platformer starring two feuding brothers doesn’t just test your jumping skills, but does so while throwing a ton of bright colors at you and using an awesome soundtrack to make every death seem like a good thing. While you may want to be frustrated as a gamer, as a person, you can’t help but be glad since it lets you listen to more music! It’s a brilliant way to make a game fun at its most challenging moments.Its classification as a racing/platformer may seem a bit confusing at first, but when you play the game, the term makes a lot of sense. Rush Bros. is a time trial-focused game with a side focus on beating stages with as few deaths as possible. Obstacles in your path aren’t just the usual platforms, springs, and spikes, but also things like rock-out stations that require rapid button presses to get through quickly or else you’ll add precious seconds to your time. It’s always tempting to blame poor performance on controls, but they work really well in Rush Bros., so that’s never an issue. Keyboard support is available, but controllers are recommended literally before the title screen hits — so play with one if at all possible. Most importantly for a precision platformer, the controls are responsive. Visually, this is a jaw-dropping game. The sharp color on black outline characters make for a nice contract with the game’s environments, which tend to be bathed in color. Beyond the usual things like space-themed and forest backdrops, there are even some with creepy faces all around them. There’s no sense of sameness with the look of levels, and the use of little color trails for power-ups only adds to the visual overload. Animations are a bit simplistic, but that’s never much of an issue with this game, or many others really, since that makes it easier to predict your own movements.The dubsteb/dance soundtrack is incredible and among the most catchy I’ve heard in a long time.The traditional sound effects of boinks and the like for jumps and springs work well, and managed to fit the genre while clearly making sure that the music is the star of the show. If you don’t like the default soundtrack, you can always customize it. At a mere $10 on Steam, Rush Bros. offers up a lot of fun for very little money. Anyone who loves precision platformers will enjoy it quite a bit, as will fans of dance music, as the OST is full of it and it’s all good stuff.Rush Bros. came out of nowhere, but is a very polished game worthy of any gamer’s time.

												I saw many videos and trailers of this gmae and thought ""hell yeah, that looks like fun. I'll buy it together with my friend and then we'll play and fun bla bla..."".But when it was released the hype was away and we waited for a sale....we got it. We paid 1€ each....and we want it back. A cup of ice cream would have been a lot more fun for the money. Now to the real review (I've been even using the Co-Op Mode): The game is fast and dynamic, in the first few seconds it's awesome, but soon the first flaws appear:- Why do they have a running animation, when you can spam the slide and are a lot faster? Keep that away, it looks like you're glitching, but if you're not doing it, you know that you should do it or you'll lose.- The game and level design is awful. Flash games look better and are for free. And you can't really tell if an obsticle is just there or if it is deadly. Maybe it is the color, but everything is glowing and so I didn't care and got kinda frustrated. And if you play coop and ""kill"" your friend....oh god the animations look so horrible.- There's no aim. You have all songs and all levels (or am I wrong? But starting with over 30 levels doesn't seem too unlockable) and therefore I don't know for what I'm playing. Me and my friend were battling and the winner got...nothing. We started the next level, had a bit fun, but it got boring soooo fast. Now you're asking ""but there are achievements which save us!"" Wrong. ""Beat XX in YY seconds."" that's it. For every level. Yay.- The level design isn't fun. In games like VVVVVV or Super Meat Boy (which I have both beaten with a sh*tload of fun) everything was hard, but fair or fun. In RB you run, fly or fall into something and ask ""WHY? WOW IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE FUN"". My friend isn't a noob either and had the same questions.- The music is meh. I'm totally into EDM and it's the most common thing I hear, but in the game I liked about 2 songs (one was the main theme). After using my songs (which took an eternity to load, my friend dealt with the same issue) the levels didn't change that much, so no ""wow"" in this either.After all, this game is so disappointing, even for paying only 1€.

												The creators of Rush Bros manage to completely miss the basic concepts of their own game, while managing to make it look somewhat pretty and have a good soundtrack. They fail to make the platforming fun or even feel right. It seems like they spent very little time getting the feel for the game correct. The animations are also fairly poor. Even the colorful visuals and music can't make up for it what is really just not a fun game to play. If I paid $10 for this game I would be pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥. In fact, I got this game for free as part of a Play Fire Rewards promotion and technically got paid for it, but I am still not happy with my decision to play this game.If you want to play a game that does the Racing-Platformer concept correctly, I would suggest SpeedRunners.

												I really, really tried to like this game. The idea of a platformer that you play to your music sounds good on paper, but I feel that Rush Bros. doesn't deliver on it's cool-sounding concept. If a game has the option to play with my music more often than not I will choose to do so. In Rush Bros. however, unless you're playing anything other than electro house you're probably going to have a hard time moving through a level since obstacles will either focus on A) the back beat B) the vocals or C) some other element to the song that isn't made readily apparent to you. This results in either trying the level with a different song or the default music (which works fine, btw) and I feel that's very poor design on the developer's part. Speaking of poor design, some of the levels in this game are just terrible. This game excells when you're going fast and dodging obstacles and there are quite a few levels where you are put in a maze and have to find keys to progress almost in a puzzle-platform kinda way. Being forced to slow down and think your way through a level wouldn't be so bad if the wall jumping didn't feel as sticky as it does, which sucks since in the puzzle levels there are tons of walls for you to stick to for whatever reason.

												For a game that seems to revolve about the idea of speed and racing, the game does an amazing job at denying you any and all sense of speed. Characters aren't very quick, and lose all speed immediately upon touching any wall surface, as they were made out of glue. The sticky nature of wall interaction probably hinders platforming more than it helps with walljumps. Rush Bros seems confused at what it wants to do, putting walljump training wheels in a title that seems to want people to compete at platforming skills.The game also is very bad about giving you information. The ""tutorial"" level has none of it, leaving me confused and stuck at some point trying to figure out what the game wanted me to do but wasn't going to tell me. I received multiple ""challenge"" notifications from random players on the tutorial stage which certainly was adding to the confusion. Levels can be confusing and hard to navigate the first time about, with some having you run deep into death traps before realizing you need a key from some obscure branch in the level, or just letting you figure out that there are no more paths available to progress and the end of the level is actually in the beginning. The music-driven part is honestly such a non-factor that I almost forgot about it. I suppose it could affect your timing based on track played, but is that really a good thing? I don't think so.Memorizing levels seems to be more rewarding than competent platforming in Rush Bros, and memorizing levels for the short minute-or-so experience is just never going to be rewarding enough.

												Rush Bros is a hardcore platformer taking after the likes of Super Meat Boy, but fails to understand any aspect of why people enjoy these type of games.  Precise controls, level consistency, and a feeling of fairness all elude this game and that makes it impossible recommend.The game's gimmick is that parts of the level move with the beat of the current music track playing.  It's an interesting idea but one that shouldn't have gone past the prototyping phrase, where it should have been discovered how badly it works out in practice.  This includes traps and not every object responds to every beat, which when mixed together with the sub-par beat detection makes this movement almost impossible to accurately predict.  This also causes certain songs to make certain levels ridiculously hard, if not impossible.  A few of the later levels take this mechanic to such extremes, I firmly believe that they are some of the worst levels ever included in any game.The other main issue with the level design is invisible traps.  Pretty much every level has spikes, but some of them in some levels will shoot at you when you get close.  There's no way to tell which ones will do this.  Spikes will even shoot at you from off screen with no warning.  What this unfortunately results in is rather than skill-based platforming, you simply have to memorize the levels to do well.  That's not real difficulty, it's poor design.These problems combined with sloppy controls can make this game very frustrating and it's not hard to see why over 90% of the reviews are negative.  While I did enjoy the music the game has to offer, it would be better to save your sanity and pass on this one.			",862,199,24,72,69,9,114

And while that is sometimes expected, it really lowered my expectations for fast-paced and fun gameplay. And while the graphics ARE flashy, yet a bit easy on the eyes, they're a bit TOO flashy. Its really hard to focus on one thing, then move your eyes to focus on another with all of the detail this game has to offer, and I feel like they tried way too hard and ended up overdoing it. I'm not saying its eyestrain or that it is'nt pretty to look at, but it slows down the gameplay even further when you cant even focus on moving from one place to another.The only thing I liked about this game is the amount of customization and free-roaming time you have. Like I said, you can make your own soundtrack and even change the color of your character which lowers the amount of bad restriction this game forces you to deal with. And, prove me if i'm wrong, since i uninstalled this game, but i think you can make your own levels. And you can even invite friends and go against eachother for bragging rights, I like that in a game, but not with this kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay.If you're the slow type who likes flashy-in your face graphics, your opinions on this game just might differ from mine. However, I didnt enjoy this piece of ♥♥♥♥ one bit.			",59,3,0,4,3,2,2

												I'm pretty disappointed. This game looks and feels like a flash game. Now, I can get along fine with that, but the problem is that as a platformer, the physics feel like a flash game aswell. The jumps feel linear and unresponsive, just like a flash game (even when playing with a controller). Which is the biggest sin for a game like this. Jumping doesn't feel like it should in platformers.On the plus side, it has great music, but thats about it. ",2490,1025,85,267,282,24,379

												I got it for free from Playfire, so what is wrong with it?The gameplay is decent and you can add your own music if the default one is too boring.But the achievements are the worst thing about this game!How can you finish the levels in such low times? For example, on the first level you need 35 seconds. I can barely get under a minute!!!Also obstacles from certain levels react to the music's rythm, so you will most likely die due to dubstep plying while going through that level.Only to play for fun, not for the achievements.

Product received for free
												Rush bros is a speedrunning focused platformer. It plays like a budget super meat boy but with environmental hazards that move in time to your music. There is a lot to not like about this game, but I'd recommend it if heavily discounted despite the many flaws.The bad-Inbuilt music is very limited and what is there is just boring, bring your own.-If you use very fast paced custom music, environmental hazards can move too quickly, making certain levels almost impossible to beat. Environmental hazards can also be difficult to predict-Playable characters differ only in appearance-Extremely barebone aesthetics-Controls take a moment to get used to, but are otherwise decent.-Not a lot of content compared to other games in the genreThe good-Environmental hazards generally respond to the pace of your music as advertised-Good variety in the somewhat limited number of levels (eg mostly straight track vs key/switch based puzzles)-No bugs encountered after 6 hours of gameplay-Large selection of online levels-Levels load quickly and checkpoints within levels are frequentOverall, I greatly enjoyed the title and would recommend if you are into speed running platformers and you see it on sale for a heavy discount. Don't be too concerned about the ocean of negative reviews that is probably surrounding this one. This product has been given away for free a few times, resulting in many reviews which appear to be from people who do like speedrunning in general, have not taken enough time to get used to how the characters move, or were expecting nothing less than the level of quality you see in games like super meat boy.

												I can't imagine there's a huge market for speedrunning games, yet I see more and more of them every year. I mean, you don't HAVE to make a game about speedrunning, you can just make something like Super Meat Boy that supports and encourages speedrunning while having plenty more to keep people hooked. Otherwise you end up with something like Rush Bros, which sacrifices story and atmosphere and exploration and pretty much everything I like about platformers in favor of making you run through bland levels again and again. And no, the D-lister techno soundtrack is not going to save it.Seriously, there's no story here. You play as a little neon DJ shuffling though visual cacophonies of black platforms and WinAmp visualizer backgrounds that pulse to the music. There are traps like spikes and... sharp things that move to the beat as well, so you'll need to run and jump and walljump around them. Most levels have doors locked with colored keys so they're not a straight shot through, as well as temporary powerups like double jumps and speed boosts to help you zoom through tricky spots.That's it. We're done here. There's no care or artistry put into the levels, they're just platforms and doors to work your way through. None of them give a sense of speed or daring that you would get from Dustforce or Super Meat Boy or even Sonic. Your DJs aren't even very fast, and can't pull off anything more complicated than a limp wall jump. There's just no reason to work at speedrunning these levels because there's no mastery to achieve here. You're not going to find clever shortcuts or reflex tests, it's just following the same boring path over and over.There's something like forty levels, and some extra game modes on top of that, but who cares? Rush Bros is incredibly effective at exactly one thing, and that's sucking every drop of possible enjoyment from speedrunning. The levels are twisty, plodding crap and the music is embarrassingly amateur-hour. Literally anything else would be more fun to speedrun, going all the way back to the original NES and beyond. Don't bother with this for any reason. Just don't.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												It was a terrible design decision to make parts of the level ""move with the beat"", while at the same time, having a randomly chosen music track. This ruins the speed and rhythm of the game. If the track deigns to, you'll be stuck behind an obstacle. Most obnoxious are the spike traps that block your path and move up and down, which again, ""move to the beat"", so even if you wait for the specific moment it switches between up and down, and try to go under/over it, ""the beat"" might still decide to change it again and squash you.The controller often stops working when you open the start menu, which is annoying, as you'll be restarting levels over and over because the achievements are horribly unforgiving and one or two deaths is too many.When racing your ghost(not optional) the camera will change focus slightly away from your character so you can watch your ghost. I don't see why you'd ever want to watch your ghost. The music will probably be different, so the level won't be the same, so things your ghost didn't have to deal with will smack you right in the face.			",158,46,2,40,12,1,32

I was mistaken, and given a sloppily excecuted game that doesn't feel rewarding at all, and instead seems like more of a chore.I'm glad that I didn't pay for this, and won it in a giveaway, because it really isn't worth the money.

												I've put in quiet a decent amount of time into this game at this point and figured it was about time to write my own honest review of the game...As a tl;dr for anyone not looking to read through this entire review before buying:I give the game a 6/10, I'll give it a thumbs up because it's enjoyable enough, but I don't necessarily recommend it. The game itself isn't for anyone and if you're planning on buying it, wait until its $5 or less as the $10 price tag is too much for this game.The game itself is exactly as it claims it is when it states that it's ""a music reactive Platform Racing Game"". The game itself is centered around competing against other players online (or against your own times) while avoiding obstacles that are  Somewhat reactive to the music. But this ""reactive"" element is where part of the problem I have with this game arises. Depending on the song currently playing, certain elements of levels can be virtually impossible to complete. As songs get more and more upbeat obstacles seem more aggressive and unpredictable. Be it those strange ""bass"" obstacles that send you flying away from them, the pulsing buzz saws, or those obnoxious cannon like things, certain songs will make these obstacles about a million times more difficult. I myself would often find myself waiting for the brief moments of peace at the end of one song while another was preparing to start before trying to quickly rush through an obstacle I'd been stuck at for what seems like ages. Next up, level design. While all the stages themselves are unique and different, there's a few major problems I've noticed in levels that just makes the game itself incredibly frustrating to play sometimes. On some levels you'll get a checkpoint nearly every 20 feet, so a death is meaningless and can cost you only a few seconds, while on other levels I felt like I'd spend a minute at a time avoiding obstacles only to die and be sent right back... And that without mentioning some horrible level layouts where I could miss a jump, fall down for about 15 seconds and land on a platform near the beginning of the level, forcing me to start almost the entire race over again.Multiplayer itself seems to work well enough, however I haven't been able to play much online. Half the time I can't find a server with anyone to play against, and whenever I can, they'll often leave before we can even pick a level or make it any significant distance into a race. However racing against a friend while chatting over skype can be a blast.Overall the game itself isn't bad... but I wouldn't by any means call it great or even necessarily good. It's a basic platformer, with controls that can be a little bit slippery, beautiful background images, and a diverse and enjoyable soundtrack. While I wouldn't necessarily recommend the game at full price unless you're really really itching to get your hands on it, I would recommend it if it drops to $5 or below. And at that point you may want to grab a 2-pack so you could send a copy to a friend if you ever wanna play a quick game to pass some time. ",355,85,2,24,23,5,41

It does get challenging, but that's a good thing.As for controls-- they're perfect with a generic gamepad.It's a cool game. Nothing mindblowing, but it is solid and entertaining. My only complaint is that it is noy as fast as and jumpy as I was expecting something with ""rush"" in the title to be. I really was hoping for a little more speed. Ah well.			",151,34,2,14,11,0,12

												Got it from Indie Gala bundle for 1$. Developers thought combining this kind of music with platforms would be a great idea, but it's not at least in this game, game is bad, music tracks by them selves aren't bad, not enjoyable to me, but good for ppl who like this kind of music. Controls in this game are not really calibrated or accurate to do that you meant, even when using an Xbox 360 controller, all the levels in game are just not fun, after getting all cards this game drops I already got bored of playing it. Also game tends to connect you by it self to play with somebody or in the other way, without asking you, which is very weird.Seems one of the typical games coming from Greenlight that are just a bit more worked that a lot free flash games around the internet, also gameplay not feels better than an average flash game.

												Good Points First: It looks nice and they've gone to some trouble to make it a challenging 'vs' speedrun platformerBad Points: The difficulty curve is vertical and the controls are not the best you've ever used (to put it politely)Even if you get past the controls (and it's not easy, they really aren't the most precise things ever) there are issues such as ""it's not always obvious what kills you and what's doesn't"".This is a textbook example of not playtesting your game with enough people.  The developers clearly ""are good at it"" but if they'd gotten 10 platform gamers to try it, they'd have been told""Make the controls tighter""""Make Obstacles more obvious""""Back-off the difficulty a bit - a least earlier on""This lacks that magic ""when you die you know it was your fault"" factor - I can't recommend it.

												At $10 its a bit steep, but regardless if you get it on sale or in a bundle the game has a lot of offer. The music was decent and I ended up getting a few of the tunes stuck in my head. The music also had some surpising variety to it, not a lot, but the fact that it was there was a pleasent surprise. The musical elements of this game take a back seat with only hazards pulsating to the beat, even then its hard to follow the pattern of music and try to listen when they'll trigger, making them feel more tacked on than part of the level. The best part of muscial incorporation are some of the genuinely interesting backgrounds as they pulse along with whatever the beat it, it adds to the visuals but doesnt annoy like some of the hazards can. The controls feel solid and works well on both a controller and keyboard. The multiplayer is still surprisingly active, and is handled quite smartly. When playing you can choose to accept challenges and continue playing single player, once another player is found it will ask if you want to race against them. More games should make use of this and due away with having to wait in a lobby. It has split screen which is amazing, this is a dying feature and I always appreciate the option when included. There are 47 levels currently total each taking about 5 minutes on average after counting deaths on some of the harder ones. You can change your racer, its color, and what music you are playing even while racing which is a nice touch. Sadly 3D vision does not work with this game, I would have loved to see the paralax backgrounds and levels pop out			",1665,543,66,177,169,21,241

I don't know if the game was patched or anything by now, but the controls feel responsive enough to me, the level design is fine (except the backtracking indeed), graphically pleasant and co-op is a lot of fun.The only thing I find really disappointing is that the stages do not actually interact with your custom songs à la Audiosurf (which was of the main interest of the game originally).

												Don't buy Rush Bros if you want to play it online. If you want to play it locally, in splitscreen, go right ahead, but the online multiplayer is pretty much dead in the water. The game has you race against an opponent in lovely neon colored levels while playing (your own personal) music in the background. It requires good timing to get through the level in time. That is, if you can find someone to play with in the first place. Unfortunately, that's the hard part.Because of that I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.

												This game is alright. If you find it on a sale for like $2-$3 its definitely worth the price. Honestly I am not a huge fan of platformers, but this one was pretty decent despite me usually being pretty bad at these types of games. After awhile you learn the controls and it becomes a little easier to manuever around the levels. The level design is alright but at sometimes gets bland and repetitive. Also, the developers were supposed to release FREE DLC but it seems as if they stopped supporting the game, so I don't know whats up with that. All in all, if you want to try out a platformer that is fast paced and pretty challenging, I say go for it. Full priced may be worth it for some people, but if you can find the game on a sale you should pick it up while you can.7/10 for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

TRIAL AND ERRORIn a sea of indie platformers that are the product of days spent basking in the glow of CRT televisions and arcade cabinets; one emerges, dropping the beat on you with more force than Skrillex could ever wish to conjure.  Rush Bros uses it's rather Dubstep heavy soundtrack, or your music, to bring life to its obstacles. Fans of games such as Amplitude or Frequency may dig the notion, though I'm not sure this iteration has sold me on these concepts by way of platformer. Rush Bros controls well, allowing players to wall jump, and slide, with collectable power-ups for speed and double jumping. At its core I think rush brothers could be a good platforming experience, with ideas pulling from recent indies such as Dustforce and Super Meat Boy, with a musical twist and an identity crisis. The art style makes use of dark blacks and neon lights that can be seen in a number of rhythm games. Although fans watching videos of preview builds will be glad to know that the art has been much improved since.The level design, on the other hand is wherein my issues lie. While touting the moniker ""Racing Platformer"" amongst a myriad of marketing materials, levels can be very tedious. Platformers can really strive when you find a level's pulse and the inherit rhythm of good design. Tapping into your music to alter the pulse is a great idea, though every time I entered that sweet spot, I would crash and burn into a wall of over complication.   It seems like many of the levels require you to back track, to progress further, this in itself is pretty disrupting when you are racing.  While subtle changes do occur, they don't seem to follow any consistent beat, it was hard to tell if each pattern was solely based on the song's BPM, (beats per minute) or on the music. This can lead to some unpredictable obstacles that can contradict the music they are getting direction from. It's not rare for the harder levels to take up to thirty minutes on your first run, though I suppose this may count as an endurance race.  Rush Bros does offer a nice simultaneous multi-player experince, as well as drop-in multi-player, adding a bit more depth than a leader board. Fortunately the drop-in feature can be disabled, it's nice to have, though it can be frustrating racing someone before you have memorized the complexities of each level. I applaud adding a bit more competition than a high score or target time to chase.   FINAL VERDICT  Masochistic joystick junkies may come to rejoice at the feet of Rush Bros, though I felt the game struggles with its identity. When I think of a rhythm based racing game, I would assume simplistic design based primarily on the flow of game play. Simple to learn, hard to master is a great strategy for platformers though I did not find it in Rush Bros. Although fans of complex platforming with an affinity for Dubstep may find it to be the perfect game.

												Overall I do not recommend this game. After playing the game for 116 minutes, several flaws in the games are apparent. Restarting the level becomes tedious because there is no key that just restarts the level. You have to press escape and click on restart and the yes button. This might seem minor, but when making a mistake over and over you could be restarting the game about 20 to 50 times trying to get a better time. Then comes the three second wait every time you restart, there seems to be no reason for this at all.There is no way to view the level so it is all trial and error. You spend minutes memorizing levels and having to react very fast and if you don't you have to restart. And restart. And restart. The level is constantly different due to the music and you can't lock a level to a single song. So after memorizing the level you still have to adapt because the beats of the song change the objects movements.There are a few bugs in the game such as warping through walls or objects. Some objects that are moving that kill you leave a hurtbox that should not be there and unfortunately you walk into nothing and die.Leaderboards is meaningless due to all the glitched scores.

												I sincerely have a strong desire to test every game, to give my opinion on every single one of them instead on going by reviews or ""specialized"" sites. I do read those things to have an idea of the game, but I still like to give a chance to every game, mainly if it's an indie one. But this one is disappointing... I don't usually make negative reviews, because I know how troublesome it is to make even a small game, but if you want a piece of advice, then go waste your money on something else.This game is nothing like promised, the stage doesn't respond very well to the songs, only a SMALL portion of it (spikes, some platforms that pops from the ground and crates that will ""smash"" you or whatever those things are) will move with the song and some of the objects that are affected will move totally out of the rhythm of a custom music and the gameplay is slow and boring. If you want to get some speed, you need to keep smashing the ""slide"" button or put your hands on a ""Speed-Up"" powerup. Seriously, multiplayer racing platformer? If you want to race a friend in a 2D platformer, go play Sonic the Hedgehog 2 or 3. In the other hand, it's a great game if you're having trouble to sleep. Surely you will feel sleepy in about 2 seconds.Has a good soundtrack, though. Still, not worth the price.The only good thing I got from this one was the 100XP from the badge.Too bad a game chosen by the Greenlight, with an incredible concept, turned out to be so boring, so badly executed...2/10, because of the songs.

												It's not the worst game I've ever played, but I don't think it's worth $10.The game advertises itself as a music based platformer, with a bit of a heavy emphasis on a competetive multiplayer aspect (which I couldn't test since nobody on my friends list owns this game). Playing through the levels makes me think of a Tron-themed Super Meat Boy, except sometimes the obstacles and so forth are extremely unforgiving (forcing you to completely restart the level if you don't get past). I like challenge, but there is such a thing as too much.The ""music based"" part is where the game disappoints me, however. Not because of the soundtrack - the game ships with some incredible music, and even has native support for your MP3s if you decide you don't like what it comes with. The problem however, is in the way the game uses the music; or to put it more accurately, how it doesn't. Occasionally there will be little blinky lights or pulsing disc things that will react to the beat, but nothing seems to react to the music in a way that actually effects the gameplay itself. I don't go faster with higher tempos, the obstacles just travel along the same timing patterns...I could load a slow, sad Sinatra song and get the same game as a high tempo Pendulum track.If you can pick it up as a freebie somewhere, go ahead, but don't drop $10 on it unless you're incredibly rich.

												Overall I do not recommend this game. After playing the game for 116 minutes, several flaws in the games are apparent. Restarting the level becomes tedious because there is no key that just restarts the level. You have to press escape and click on restart and the yes button. This might seem minor, but when making a mistake over and over you could be restarting the game about 20 to 50 times trying to get a better time. Then comes the three second wait every time you restart, there seems to be no reason for this at all.There is no way to view the level so it is all trial and error. You spend minutes memorizing levels and having to react very fast and if you don't you have to restart. And restart. And restart. The level is constantly different due to the music and you can't lock a level to a single song. So after memorizing the level you still have to adapt because the beats of the song change the objects movements.There are a few bugs in the game such as warping through walls or objects. Some objects that are moving that kill you leave a hurtbox that should not be there and unfortunately you walk into nothing and die.Leaderboards is meaningless due to all the glitched scores. Some people have beaten a lot of the levels in 0.0 seconds making it all pointless.			",43,5,0,2,1,1,1

												Rush Bros.; for those of us who didn't grow up on regenerative health and hand-holding platforming, Sonic 2 vs mode has never looked so good, or been so fun. My only negative experiences have been with low player base and the fact that with the exception of 1 person (who left after 2 loses) the majority of racers you find in this game are unable to take losing, and most races end with your opponent quitting. Overall, it's much simpler platforming than something like Super Meat Boy; not to detract from its difficulty at all, it's plenty hard, but the races weren't meant to stop someone in their tracks forever. Which is part of the problem, players who are inexperienced tend to quit before they have a chance to learn to play. It's a game you have to get good, but the game is set up in a discouraging way.I'd say with some basic interface modifications, some updates to multiplayer features, and a couple tweaks to the camera (which irrationally zoomed to a location that my player wasn't in a couple times) this could be a game that has a strong community for multiplayer, and see's its multiplayer population skyrocket. I enjoy it, but I've hit a player cap after only an hour and a half of practice. 15 games in a row disconnected or cancelled before they even started. What's sad is that it's like players don't know they can decline the song and pick something else; and I would have accepted it 100% of the time.Potentially a 7/10 depending on how much you enjoy racing your own shadow if you don't have a friends list filled with Rush Bros. players.

												Rush Bros. is the rare type of game that manages to fail at its core mechanic. It is a rhythm platforming game where an algorithm determines the pacing of traps and projectiles based on the beat of a song. Unfortunately the developers have chosen to make the soundtrack a variable, meaning that every person who plays the same level will be met with a different experience and, more importantly, a different level of difficulty.The level design often betrays itself and the player; where a certain coloured platform may be safe to stand on, another platform of the same colour will instantly kill the player. Similarly, traps may fly across the screen and kill the player in a manner you never would have expected. Nothing is ever clearly explained or defined before the player encounters an obstacle, which means you'll often have to play through a level multiple times before understanding how it actually works. It's a level of artificial difficulty created by the developer as more of a joke on the player rather than competent game design.			",820,298,26,81,64,10,105

												If you’re looking for a game with music-influenced gameplay -- like its store page promises --, you’ll likely be a bit disappointed by ‘Rush Bros.’. The 40+ levels are always the same, no matter which track plays in the background. The extent of the music’s influence is how or how fast certain obstacles move. So, not exactly ‘Audiosurf’-level music immersion, really.On the other hand, if you’re looking for a difficult platformer with a decent soundtrack, ‘Rush Bros.’ could be the game for you. The only other gripe I have with the game is how the character animations aren’t exactly… well, animations -- which makes moving through the levels feel not exactly fluid.But its local as well as internet multi-player should make up for that if you’re looking for a little competition.

This versus indie has a awesome soundtrack and is really fun to play with a friend on a rainy day when you have nothing else to do than battle each other in a fast paced game of rush bros but having said that it wont give you many hours of fun as there isnt that many levels to play on and its a bit of a speedrunners clone.

												Rush Bros is another average quality platformer. It does have some positives, especially the art style, music and general presentation. But the core gameplay experience is poor by platformer standards. The level design is not at all rewarding or fun to play, and the controls are imprecise and awkward. I lost interest, picked up the rest of the cards and got outta there.			",200,37,8,11,7,6,16

												I have been playing it with a friend, and it is really fun to just race. It would be nice if there was a level editor or if the devs made more levels, we've done them allControls are easy, but the game doesn't tell you them. I find that to be good, unlike all the spoon-fed people who play tutorials, as I like to figure it out by myself.Music - alright, but i can use my own, so that's fineThe obstacles are a bit off of the beat, but it makes it hilarious sometimes.Some of the levels make a huge difficulty spike above the norm (which by the way is quite easy) e.g. Glitchfield, Bring A Towel, Boss.wav and prettymuch all of the levels that reset you back to the start if you dieOverall, very goodSeries coming up on youtube sometime in the next year on 2 and a half miners8/10			",93,8,35,5,12,1,20

												I got this one for free from Playfire and have done most of the achievements. It's not my style of game at all so I'm not sure how unbiased I can be, but I can imagine that the music-trap relationship that makes the levels too random and frequently unbeatable is a huge no-no, *especially* for fans of this type of game. Besides that, it's fine, really. Tough and repetitive, but satisfying to get it right. Of course, I had a small financial incentive, so your mileage may vary depending on how much you value achievements.			",111,30,1,59,28,0,53

												Rush Brothers is an Indie type multiplayer game where you can play music from your computers hard drive while the elements of each level respond to the bass frequencies (40-200 Hz). Each player can have their own song playing, so one song won't be streaming at the same time. I really like how the 2D concept & all the obstacles almost remind me of the old Sonic games. If you're looking for a multiplayer race game & you wanna listen to music, but in the actual game, I'd definitely go for this game! Shout out to Ian Boswell for making such an indredible game!

												The game tries to be an electro version of super meat boy, and while the music and neon colors is fine and likable at first, after about 5minutes it becomes soul-wrenching and eye-torchuring. This game has controls? Could’ve fooled me, because the first 10 minutes of my time with it was spent trying to figure out why the hell I couldn’t move my character around the screen, at all. Well, as it turns out, unlike most other (well put-together) games, Rush Bros completely ignores the fact that you’ve plugged in a controller when you actually begin playing it (despite the fact it works 100% properly in the menus you use to actually take you to the “play” portion of the game). Yes, you have to manually bind the controller to the actions you want your character to complete. Once you actually get running, it quickly dawns on you that everything about the running, jumping, positioning, and wall-grabbing in this game is completely off. Jumps seem to inconsistently propel you varying distances, movement is so floaty it’s impossibly difficult to land on a jump pad that takes up nearly 20% of the screen real-estate, and the speed at which your character slides down walls when he grabs them will have you wondering if he’s composed of primarily molasses. The levels are by far the worst thing in this game, they are not built for speedrunning or fluent platforming at all. The way levels ""react"" to the music - traps spring up quicker when faster music is playing is infuriating.			",105,2,3,6,3,1,7

												I can why people dislike this game. I can see why people do like it. And some people don't like cause of the difficulty. I know the guy who made this game and we talk on skype sometimes. So here are my thoughts on the game.1. Controls:The controls are the thing that he should have worked on a bit more, but I got used to them. 2/52. Gameplay:The gameplay has its ups and downs. I think this game was trying to be a game like Meat Boy, I Wanna Be the Guy, etc. etc. Same concept, same difficulty. 3/53 . Music:Ok, let's get serious... CHECK THIS ♥♥♥♥IN' ♥♥♥♥ OUT! This game was based souly on music, and they nailed it out of the park! It's badass, and you play the to the beat sometimes. I find myself playing this game just cause of the music. I love it so much, on so many levels! 5/54. Level design:Razors, walls, spikes, and colors are EVERYWHERE! I find myself getting stuck on while playing this game and it fustrating a lot. But kinda good over all. 3/55. The game:Fun, fustrating, and dubstep (techno too) being made by mostly one person, it's a good game. I would rather play it over some games. OVER ALL RATING! 6/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have no idea what this is supposed to be. When it was in greenlight, I was excited, but only because I misunderstood. I thought it would be like Audiosurf and it makes custom levels with your music. Nope. Blocks will pop of faster if your music is fast! Such wow! Amazing! This is 21st century technology here! I might as well play a half-decent platformer and put on iTunes or go into Big Picture and do the Steam music feature to have a better time than this. There is also no story. I want to know the story between these 2 'D-J's-'! I got this with playfire and it wasn't even worth the price of free! Levels are very repetative. Jump. Jump. Die. Jump. (and the occasional) Slide. That's it! The achievments seem imposible too. HOW CAN YOU NOT DIE ON THE FIRST LEVEL IF YOU NEED TO GET TRAPPED IN A ROOM FULL OF SPIKES TO COMPLETE THE LEVEL???!!*UPDATE 6/14/14* There is a way to not die in the 1st level and it is extremly hard to get it. When I go on music longer than 3 minutes, my game freezes up for a few seconds and plays the song. It's not even worth that wait! You can only listen to about 1 minute of the song! Then when you go to the next level, it won't take you to the place where you left off, IT WILL TAKE YOU TO THE SONG BEFORE IT!!! I don't want to listen to their techno crap thing. I listen to metal. It claims everything will be fast paced if you play a fast paced song. I played War Ensemble by Slayer. It took forever to load. Everything seemed about as fast as a really old and simple song. I still do not recommend this game and probably never will unless they fix anything. If I play M.I.A by Avenged Sevenfold in the level selection, the Djs start humping their turntables.

												I came for what it advertised, a multiplayer platformer with the ability to import your own playlists and have the level sync to the music, and I got what I came for. The controls are not the best, and at least one level is impossible with most of my songs, and the multiplayer seems sketchy, but it works and it was worth the 70c I payed for it. Its a nice game to play for 5-10 minutes with friends, but you can get bored of it quickly. I dont recommend it as a platformer, but as a casual, lighthearted multiplayer game with a cool graphic style, nice music and an awesome gimmick.			",174,30,8,14,10,1,31

												This is my opinion and you have complete right to disagree and/or to think differently.Broken controls - pushing a button for an action has about 40% chance to fail registering resulting in running into spykes, just sitting in a pit, falling down.Annoying music - levels are made for 30 sec - 2 minutes, songs are 3 minutes+, there is no music during the level load, there is no music during the start countdown, there is music just during the run, every time is a different song. Considering that you have time only to hear the starting chords of the song before the level is over and that next time you hear the start of a different song - it becomes increasingly annoying.I would've seen playing this game at a party were quick action and short levels are perfect to keep the guests entertained without taking too much attention span away if only the controls were not broken and the music was more continuous (just keep playing the song through the countdown and level load so that there is a connected experience)Anyhow, even with the controls and music intact, the amount of entertainment that this game would provide is maaaybe worth $5. But even for $2, considering that it does have bugs is a stretch and I would have to think about it.P.S.: the video options are also broken - if you change more than 1 setting at a time, then there is a chance that some of your changes will not get applied. Navigating the menu after playing with my controller, somehow becomes impossible using the d-pad or the keyboard arrows, and after hovering over a menu item get the sound for a dozen or even more of selection change events. I wonder if there was a QA to check this game before they've released it to public?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's an okay 2D platformer that looks nice, but the game's involvement with your music library is basically the equivalent of having iTunes open while playing.  It doesn't feel like running through the levels would make much of a difference whether or not I was using the game's OST, my music folder, or no sound at all.  I was expecting more out of it, but it might be OK  to grab during a steep sale or something.			",199,23,4,8,10,5,12

												For me, it was a laggy and lazy Super Meat Boy clone with the Multiplayer feature barely noticable. Seriously, the other player is more like a ghost than anything. How can something be a race if one player has to run all the way back to flip a switch so the second player can just go forward, the competitivity is cheap at that point. The music does make a difference but it will only mess up your running by bursting up dumb obstacles by it's own definition of a beat. It's a bad Multiplayer Super Meat Boy game that took the fun out of Super Meat Boy			",40,20,0,6,11,0,2

												The game feels like a generic flash game. I wouldn't really mind that too much since some games made in flash is really great! But there's one thing which makes me NOT recommend this game! You finish the levels in such a fast pace that you only get to hear the half of a song and then it just ends.If I play a rythm game, I wanna hear the whole song! Imagine playing Guitar Hero and the song just suddenly stops when you're rocking out and stuff.That's pretty much all I can say about it. The sudden music stopping thing pretty much ruins everything for me.			",351,70,17,27,47,3,43

												Eeeeh...I was excited for music aspects as a bonus to some sort of Super Meat Boy-esque platformer... and was less rewarded with a game that reminded me of I Wanna Be the Guy but less challenging.  The game skips every time you select a new track, and the music is just a side note...I'm not sure why people are calling this polished or addictive :/Super glad I only got it for $0.99 rather than the full price.

												Short Review:The game has literally nothing to do with the music. Otherwise a worse-than-average platformer.Full Review:- GameplayThe game and level design is awful. It is a simple platformer with constantly flashing lights that do no part to make the game look nice and your friends don't here what music you are playing. If anything, the music is just what you play in the background. You don't jump, dodge or do anything that is related to the music, fully contrary to what it claims “Discover gameplay with custom music” . There's nothing to customise at all.- ControlsThe controls are also simple but really plain because of the poor execution. You find yourself trying hard to jump, run, dodge, not because it is difficult, but because the game mechanis are just off. You respawn next to the obstacle which continues to run even when you die, so you are essentially waiting for the right moment to jump -- and even then, it doesn't feel fun doing that. It is not tense at all. It is boring jumps and runs all the way. - VerdictI am glad I got it for free. It was a waste of time to even install it.			",90,9,6,7,4,3,11

												Really cool idea with a terrible execution. I love rhythm games and I grew up playing platformers. The game doesn't play as much to the beat but rather tries its best to simulate one. Some of the later levels are Super Meat Boy level difficult, but with all these terrible obstacles sort of matched to the rhythm it makes the game frustrating. The game has 47 levels and the difficulty ramps up quite quickly. Eventually, spikes start to move so quickly that prediction is necessary to avoid death, but the game is extremely checkpoint heavy to its benefit. There are some spikes that move backwards, and at this point the game devolved into masocore (eg I wanna Be The Guy) levels of nonsense. Early on the most painful levels are ones that make you repeat the stage repeatedly, unlocking the next door only to be forced to drop down to start the level over again to get the next key for the next door. The worst levels are those that are heavily layered and filled with traps so if you fall you can lose a lot of time. After that are the ""boss"" levels, which get rid of the generous checkpointing you rely on. The thing I found to be most helpful was to find the song with the quietest beginning that wouldn't trigger most obstacles and spam LB to replay it over and over again. It took away from the musical aspect of the game, but the musical aspect is a suggestion at best.The game doesn't react very well to your music and there are only a few obstacles that do: spikes, table saws, rising platforms, repulsor bumpers (think Super Meat Boy) and zombies. There are a handful of others that are static like buzz saws and spikes. The repulsors are the worst obstacle in this game because on any given song it seemed to be random when they would activate, which led to a lot of long falling and time lost.The zombies are probably annoying too but I couldn't see them because there was a bug(?) where they stopped spawning after I restarted my game to fix another bug where the game wouldn't checkpoint me at all. I considered the former a beneficial bug so I didn't restart the game again.I got this game for free and my favorite thing about it was being able to listen to a few good songs that I had forgotten about in my music library. Also, the rainbow level toward the end was pretty okay.			",205,41,8,28,15,1,27

												All in all, a pretty solid platformer to me.  The stage elements don't really seem to be moved by the music that well, except for the bass section, but even without it working great there the platforming's still good.  It's a nice, more easy-going platformer because of all the respawn points, but that's what I like about it, that I can come to it for a nice relaxing session.  The amazing soundtrack and visuals, which are probably the very best features of this game, make it just a great game to sit down with and have some easy-going fun.			",79,23,1,9,6,0,1

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine  PLEASE NOTE: If I (the reviewer) have played a game that has less than 1 hour of gameplay and is not recommended, means that I did not enjoy or it did not live up to my expectations! Think twice before rating or giving out a comment... Rush Bros. hmm, what can I say about Rush Bros.Either the developers who are developing/developed Speedrunners got bored and opened up a new company and made a crappy version of their great game, or a developer felt like creating a game like Speedrunners and make music about it. Dunno, you can decide...So first, the controls... they are the worst control schemes I have ever seen (on keyboard) as far as I know, platformer games use the arrow keys to move, and x/z key to jump. Then why on earth did the people at XYLA Entertainment think it was great to make the controls WASD and the Spacebar, my fingers are apart and for a platformer it is extremely uncomfortable, let's see what else is bad in this ""game""Oh yeah! THE LEVEL DESIGN, who on earth created these levels!?! They are either extremely easy or near impossible, someone must of been bored and felt like making the levels all confused and jumbled up. Great work! (He says sarcastically)Hmm, oh yeah, the animation, looks... ugly. Now normally I love Indie games, and I don't really complain about the graphics in great Indie games, but this ""Indie"" game, the animations and quality and also the presentation on the game looks ugly and not very professionalOk... what's next. OH YES, the multiplayer. The multiplayer... is a bag of dung mostly. Either the people who are playing with me have very bad internet and lag all the time, or I start playing and the other player couldn't give a toss and just stays their or the person who is about to play with me probably has brains and doesn't play this game.But... ThePCGamer101, you might ask, isn't their something good in this game, after all, you did buy this game didn't you?No, I actually was stupid enough to get it from GreenManGaming (they were giving it away, because probably people never bought it)The only good thing I say that is good in this game is that the game can actually play music from your personal libraries, which is kinda cool listening to great music while trying to play this disaster of a gameOverall, this game is a mess, not a terrible mess, but it is not a great nor good game. If you get the game for free or something like that, play it for a while, then get bored, and as you can probably see from my playtime (15 minutes or so) I got bored REALLY quickly NOT RECOMMENDED :(  Best to play with a controller, if you can  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												the trailer had me excited, i believed i would experience an intense sensation of speed provided both my the character movements and the musically effected levels; sadly the music doesn't interact with the level designs in a truly dynamic or interesting way, the controls felt loose and slidey(something that shouldn't be allowed in this type of game); and while attempting to find some enjoyment in this purchase, i played levels that were literally impossible to complete. The hype is not real, the music selection was the only part i liked,  which i can easily enjoy through several free methods; If you're looking for a good game with a more intergral mixture of gameplay and music, I recomend Crypt of the Necrodancer.

												Neat little platformer game. Not really original or unique, but not overly challenging either. I think I enjoy it because it tends to find the sweet spot of being challenging yet forgiving. Of course, there are exceptions (I'm looking at you, level 42) but. Admittedly it's a game that fails at what it's trying to do since the music-based elements hardly tend to feel like it at all and mostly end up being random (many songs won't even have consistent behaviors on the environment, so...). And the game has a tendency to be glitchy as well.Also I should mention that the soundtrack is just alright. Electronic music isn't really my thing. There's a few songs I like anyways though. But normally I kept to only using those few songs.Also two of the achievements are broken and/or impossible. If that matters to you. Kind of miffed about it myself.And the devs have abandoned the game already so if that's a dealbreaker, then sure.Honestly it's kind of hard to defend this game all things considered, but that doesn't mean I can't still like it.EDIT: In retrospect this is a pretty cruddy game isn't it. Just browsing through my old reviews like ""why is this a positive review"" and so okay. Meh. I've played too many platformers to have any good will towards bad platformers nowadays.

												This is arguably one of the worst PC games I have ever had the misfortune of playing.Pros: The music isn't terrible, and you could hypothetically use your own music too.The multiplayer can actually be kind of fun at times.Cons: Everything else...Before even playing the game, the starting menu can be confusing. When trying to start the single player, you'll likely end up trapped in charcter customiztion or control bindings. Assuming you can tackle that, the game then trys to pair you up with random players on the internet. Frustrating as that was, I did manage to find some multiplayer enjoyable, up until track 10 or so. For a platformer that demands a lot, the controls are quite sh**. You cannot be expected to complete some of the objectives with the controls being as they are. The movements don't always seem consistent, and, at times, enraging. When trying to slide down walls, it is discovered that the Rush Bros. are actually honey and stick to the walls. What a hoot.The game's claim to fame, using your own music, changes only a few spikes on each level. It doesn't really take the song into account, just sparatically throws spikes every few beats. No matter what music you use however, the game's respawn sytem is sure to screw you over every time. Respawning you directly into a trap-repedatly.The absolute WORST part of this game is the fact that it doesn't even work half the time. On 4 multiplayer sessions, the camera decides it doesn't need to follow me anymore. You're literally running the stage blind as the camera zooms and spins in an elegant mating ritual. Did I need to see that pool of acid or that small landing paltform? The game would say no.All in all, rated 2/10. THAT'S A TWO OUT OF 10. The pros come nowhere near overcoming the cons of this game. It is a crime against humanity to sell this heap of trash at $10. I almost regret buying the humble bundle for this game. Wouldv'e quit after maybe 20 minutes if they didn't include the trading cards I needed for the Summer Adventure 2014. Smart move devs. These cards are likely the only reason anyone may still put time into this game.			",182,47,5,22,27,0,42

												I would be more likely to grate my head against a grater and eat the pieces then play this again. Controls just aren't responsive enough			",209,31,3,14,10,3,30

												Please do yourself a favor and don't buy this. Not even if it's on sale. I wouldn't even buy this in a bundle. I guess it looks fun in the videos but that's not how it feels if you play. The controls are horrible. It feels like a cheap Jump'n'run without fine tuning. Just off. And if this isn't bad, the level-""design"" is even worse. It's just not fun to play. If you're in need for a nice jump and run with great music, buy Super Electronic Joy. Better graphics, direct controls, great music, sarcasm and it's even cheaper than this piece of junk :D			",301,44,3,7,19,5,14

												This free game was not worth a penny more than I paid for it. There are lots of great indie platformers out there, but I'm afraid this just isn't one of them.			",362,124,13,38,26,6,68

												It aimed to be a high-speed platformer and it does it reasonablely well.  However, what makes this game worthwhile is the soundtrack and the music-oriented effects in the level backgrounds.			",390,98,9,28,41,7,49

												They recommend gamepad for this - did not feel like it is easier. If you like challenge (i.e. you are masochist) you going to love this game. I must admit I am not  platformers fan but this game was frustrating as hell, especially if you try to get achievement ( any achieviement).			",682,286,31,104,65,9,135

												This is my opinion and you have complete right to disagree and/or to think differently.Broken controls - pushing a button for an action has about 40% chance to fail registering resulting in running into spykes, just sitting in a pit, falling down.Annoying music - levels are made for 30 sec - 2 minutes, songs are 3 minutes+, there is no music during the level load, there is no music during the start countdown, there is music just during the run, every time is a different song. Considering that you have time only to hear the starting chords of the song before the level is over and that next time you hear the start of a different song - it becomes increasingly annoying.I would've seen playing this game at a party were quick action and short levels are perfect to keep the guests entertained without taking too much attention span away if only the controls were not broken and the music was more continuous (just keep playing the song through the countdown and level load so that there is a connected experience)Anyhow, even with the controls and music intact, the amount of entertainment that this game would provide is maaaybe worth $5. But even for $2, considering that it does have bugs is a stretch and I would have to think about it.P.S.: the video options are also broken - if you change more than 1 setting at a time, then there is a chance that some of your changes will not get applied. Navigating the menu after playing with my controller, somehow becomes impossible using the d-pad or the keyboard arrows, and after hovering over a menu item get the sound for a dozen or even more of selection change events. I wonder if there was a QA to check this game before they've released it to public?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really unresponsive controls (both on keyboard and Xbox controller), like not jumping at  the moment you press the jump button..extremely irritating for a platformer. Annoying in many ways, you always die, can't even see why someone competitive and craving for difficult games would like it, everything here is pretty much lame except the music, but no matter how good the music, nothing would make me recommend this game.
