Early Access Review
								Space Ribbon is good fun for short bursts of time.The visuals and soundtrack are fantastic, while the sound effects aren't so strong. I love the attention to detail, the cars are especially cool. The graphics remind me Beetle Adventure Racing meets BLUR.The game plays fairly well, the handling is pretty tight. When I hit the side of the ribbon road, I expected to fall off, Mario Kart style. But it just bounces me back into the linear road.It would be great if there was some alternate paths to take or some power ups or something in terms of content while actually racing. In my experience of the game, it's pretty easy to win every race. The challenge comes really late into play time.All that being said, this is absolutely worth the Early Access price tag of £9.99 (£6.59 on sale)Grab it now, put up with it not being perfect and enjoy the finished game.

								You chase a Space Panda or Tiger on a track it spews out in space using various space cars. It's like a David Bowie fever dream, kinda. It's an experience eitherway. Cars look pretty cool, and go through an evolution of upgrades, and the Space Beasts are both fantastic and a little creepy.Driving can get kinda clunky though, feels like there's a lot of resistance to turn around and go the other way but, on spinouts it's rather hard to get the car facing the right way. Power-ups would be nice though. Maybe run it through some tests to liven things up, races at the moment just feel a little straightforward, there's little agency other than slipstreaming but nothing to combat when someone gets too far ahead other than they can end the race.Colour me impressed but don't ""panda"" to me by adding a Snow Leopard skin for the Tiger, or do, actually I'd really like that. Eitherway the potential for greatness is there, it's just a case of realising it, and I'd suggest things here and there but, I'll keep an eye out for a full release.			",871,233,79,111,107,10,128

								Nice little racing game, if you're like me you don't often get that urge to play a racing game but when you do you want one that's easy to pickup and play and Space Ribbons is that game.There's some camera issues, devs are aware of it already though. It never really bothered me.The gameplay is smooth, no stuttering or frame drops for me. It has that Mario Kart F-Zero kind of feel to it so if you're familiar with either series you'll have no issues.I'd really recommend it for anyone like me who only casually plays racing games, if you play more hardcore you might want to check another review.While I got this for free, knowing what I do now I would have bought it for myself. Might even buy it for a friend someday. ",30,2,0,0,0,0,1

Early Access Review
What Is A Space Ribbon Anyway?If you could ever capture the core essence of the psychedelic experience and manifest it as a video game, then surely its name would have to be Space Ribbon...Onteca Ltd's surrealistic and highly trippy new space racer. Upon its fantastical race tracks in this vividly colourful cosmos, you'll soon be greeted by the beautifully strange as you behold animal headed spaceships spewing forth these procedurally generated tracks of glory from their very mouths in real time...continuously teasing you with the checkered finish line which always seems just out reach as you go head to head with your AI opponents to reach it the quickest. Whereas invisible barriers on each side prevent you from hurdling off into oblivion by bouncing you right back onto the track.Eye-Candy EverywhereI cannot possibly over-emphasize how breathtakingly gorgeous the visuals are here - they are the very definition of eye-candy. You'll be awash in vivid neon colours transforming their hypnotic hues all around you...with a bounty of stars and varied celestial bodies decorating the landscape across 6 different types of race events as you veer down these futuristically designed ribboned tracks at full throttle...twisting and curving around their elegantly styled contours. Early AccessNow it must be clearly stated that the game is still very much in Early Access, and requires further improvements and polishing in order to truly make it shine to its full potential. But so far it already arrives complete with a fine collection of several eye-catching and well-designed race cars spanning from the vintage era all the way up to cutting-edge jet-propulsion types. These various elements all combine together seamlessly so as to create a delightful feast for the senses, soon eliciting emotions of elation, as well as awe & wonder within me that I've never quite felt before with any other game...which were further reinforced by the visual expansiveness of this imaginative environment.Controls Need More PrecisionYet as clearly impressive as the aesthetics are, both the handling of your car as well as its gameplay left quite a bit to be desired for me. Specifically, I felt that the cars could have handled much better with a crisper level of responsiveness when moving left/right. Additionally, they tended to spin out far too easily in my opinion, and furthermore they also didn't achieve a sense of eye-watering speed that I was very much hoping for going in. Lastly, at times they tended to get bunched up together and stuck to one other during the race...which greatly slowed down the momentum of gameplay. A game like Space Ribbon is crying out to be played frantically and ultra fast-paced, with lighning quick precision moves and that white-knuckled edge-of-your-seat sense of speed and acceleration. Unfortunately, I just didn't feel any of this as of the current build...and it would be my recommendation to the developer to take these points into consideration moving forward as its development progresses.Gameplay LackingAnd on the gameplay side of things, I felt it was far too basic and one-dimensional for a visual masterpiece like this one (simply get from point A to point B faster than your opponents). Clearly, these space racers need a nitous oxide/turbo boost bar...in addition to a power-up system for various items to be collected during the races in order to make things much more interesting. And that would be the bare minimum here, quite honestly. It very much needs a lot more work on this side of things, in order to take this game to the next level. It is my hope that the developer sees this as well, and implements additional mechanics to make this a highly addictive experience, one where the player will be eager to keep going back for more...because visuals can only take a game so far...no matter how impressive they may be.Virtual Reality In More Ways Than OneAs of right now, no online multi-player exists (only local) - but from what I understand there are plans to include this at a later date thankfully. As well, the game currently includes VR Support (both HTC Vive & Oculus Rift) which must be phenomenal to behold here especially. So that's a definite plus to be sure, especially coupled with its full controller support, Steam achivements, and trading cards.Verdict - 7/10I've always been mesmerized by colourful and imaginative games featuring bright neon colours...and this one is certainly no exception. I also happen to love traditional racing games as well, so a fusion of the two concepts is sure to be a winner in principle. It is my firm belief that this game has an unlimited amount of untapped potential to be incredible, but it isn't quite there yet. I am very much impressed with what has been accomplished with it so far on the visual side of things, and once other areas receive further refinements, improvements, and polish... then who knows...perhaps it will be one of my very favourite games. Space Ribbon is off to a fast start so far. Now let's see if it can eventually reach the winning line in first place.I'll rate this one a tentative 7/10 as of now, with potential for a higher score at a later date once a finished product is finally released. Pros:- Visually highly impressive- Fantastic 3D modeling of the cars & track- Distinctive synth soundtrack- Full controller support- High frame-rates- Steam achievements + trading cards- StatsCons:- Car handling needs more work- Gameplay is currently too simplistic- Races are too short- Lack of config options for display aside from quality (ie. no resolution nor vsync settings) For similar reviews and great giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com ",2027,729,85,132,115,17,145

								This game can be great, think of rocket league but with racing. This game has bugs, lots of them, but the devs are active and working on them. Also the devs are so friendly and actually listen to US about what we have to say about the game. I bealive with time, this game is going to be great. At this point in time i still enjoy playing it and seeing the new updates. 6/10 as of now :)			",117,9,1,12,18,2,4

Early Access Review
								The Backgound looks nice, and the track looks ok.The cars and sound effects are not so impressive - the sound effects are awful to be honest.The music is nice if you like electronic music.The game does indeed have a trippy feel thanks to the animal mouths spewing out the track, and thanks to the cosmic background.The gameplay itself I think is just too barren at present; whizzing around a randomly generated track, where sometimes the sharp curves are hard to see coming.Can't say I enjoyed it much in its current state. I will not get a refund, but hope the game gets more fleshed out and may try again in the future			",73,7,35,1,5,0,4

Early Access Review
								The visuals are lovely, particularly the tracks and the space background. Handling is decently arcade-y, and easy to get used to, although I do wish the cars felt weightier. The music isn't to my taste, but isn't terrible. What is terrible is the sound effects. Everything from the engines to collisions sounds weak, and it's very distracting. But playing to my music library with the game completely muted is a lot of fun. Since the races are short, and either winning or placing in the top three unlocks new stuff, it's easy to get into the ""just one more race"" groove. With just a little more polish, this could be a must-have.ETA: This review applies to non-VR only, as I don't have a VR setup.			",1603,732,61,207,160,18,229

								The concept is a unique one, and it drew me in. However there is barely any game here. There are attempts to flesh out the game with unlockables and parts for the cars; but the races are extremely dull and unsatisfying. The sound design is almost non-existent, and the handling and controls are clunky. Definitely not worth £6.99 in its current state.			",135,33,10,6,18,1,31

								In it's current state, this game isn't worth $10, $2.50, or even more than an hour of your time. It has tons of potential, but if you have your eye on it I'd recommend waiting until it is out of early access.Pros+ Decent soundtrack+ Good visuals, even if the cars look somewhat out of place+ Randomized tracksCons- Gets old fast/little replayability- Car handling is bad- Bugs- Gross UI- Stock sound effects- Generally lame and generic power-upsConclusionDon't get this game yet. It has lots of potential and is a neat concept, but isn't fun in its current state.			",55,13,0,5,5,0,8

								When I see the words Psychedelic and VR...  instant buy.   BUT it wasn't so ""psychedelic"".But Rather just REALLY COOL lol.You know when you play a game and you say, ""This is way too EZ.""And you KNOW you spoke too soon?!  I had that moment.I love this.  Procedurally generated race tracks?  MUST use Xbox controller.(sometimes you have to recharge your motion controllers, know what i mean!?)I guess you can use a keyboard...   ZzzzScrew you if you don't have an Xbox controller.  (pssst.  i hate you)If you think racing in 3rd person in VR is stupid...  then maybe you're stupid.Looking around actually helps you PREDICT where this insane track is going.It reminds me of Blazerush but being right there IN the action.  It's the complete opposite because in Blazerush you're being chased by a spike harvester monster truck.  In this, you're CHASING that MONSTER that is creating this paradox of a track.  First one to touch the massive Panda or Tiger wins.  (Pumpkin.  Special Halloween circuit)IMO it's worth the price.  I got it for $6.50757MB			",494,57,29,12,61,8,30

								I believe other reviewers have pointed out the big improvements needed in this in game so ill keep this short and sweet,the game itself is good and has alot of potential especially of vivid it is and the tracks being generated in real time in front of you.i would like to point out some UI changes which may help, firstly if you could add some text under the CC difficulty stating which one is supposed to be ""Easy"" ""Medium"" and ""Hard"" as a guy who barely plays any racing games i found just the CC number confusing, also if you can seperate the levels and have something of a description next to them stating which rules were present (i was quite underwhelmed after playing the first level as i though that was what the whole game was, decided to play 4 more levels befor i made my decision and realized that there were actually weapons/shields and low gravity levels etc..)also some bigger improvements to consider for the long termsteam co-op multiplayer it doesnt need to have matchmaking but at least have it so that i can play with others on my friends list who have also bought the game.and a mini level creator would be cool down the line (enable low gravity disable shields enable guns, etc etc..)Pros-Looks Great-Good gameplay although controls can do with a bit of workCons: -UI needs some improvement-MultiplayerOverall , 7/10, could easily become an 8.5 or 9 with some changesall in all thank you for the free key ",30,15,0,5,7,0,1
