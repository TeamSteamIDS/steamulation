												In case your confused Flatout Ultimate Carnage is Flatout 2 with a few extras. Basically Flatout 2 with a DLC in it would be the best way to describe it. In truth it was a re-release of Flatout 2, not exactly sure why.I hate racing games. So for me to like a racing game it must be pretty damn fun. The game includes a garage where you can purchase and upgrade many vehicles. Your car takes visible damage and so do the AI cars. You can wreck your car out of the race and you can also take out AI opponents by causing enough damage to them.Some of the best feeling cars in a simulation. It doesnt feel ""arcadey"" yet cars become very managable at high speeds. There is even a crash durby mode.WARNING - Don't even think about Flatout 3. A totally different company did Flatout 3 and unless you want to see an example of the worst race game ever don't bother. Flatout 2/Flatout 2 Ultimate Carnage is the best in the series.SERIOUSLY - No idea if the forum is still up for Flatout 3 but at some point I was wondering if they were going to shut it down because of so many complaints. Have you ever bought a game programming book with an example race game in it? Flatout 3 was worse than that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome remake of FlatOut 2 with the better graphics and working on-line matches!But ""Games For Windows Live"" is HELL:1. The game won't start at all (without any error message) if you haven't installed the ""support/XLiveRedist01.02.0241.00.msi"" file from the game's directory on your hard disk (the setup wizard tries to install it automatically, but fails to locate the file and just skips it)2. The game won't let you play if you haven't created an account at http://live.com/3. The game won't let you play (will show a weird message) if you haven't tied your live.com account to an account at http://account.xbox.com/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A timeless classic! There is nothing more to say. No other arcade racing game has such awesome feel and handling, at least no other racing game that i know of (and i know  a lot). Especially in multiplayer mode this game is addictive.In order to play FOUC you need to install Microsoft GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE. You should be able to install WINDOWS LIVE by doubleclicking the exe [LiveUpdateLauncher] located in the game directory. The game directory is usually [C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Flatout Ultimate Carnage]BTW: We are still playing it online via ""Games for Windows Live"". The Microsoft announcement from June 2014 that ""GFWL"" will be closed at 1st July was false. Microsoft told us that ""GFWL"" will not close anytime soon.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played the retail of this game, the not retail, the steam release on another account and a few times on this account.. So.. What is Flatout UC and what makes it tick? Basically, an upgraded Flatout 2 with some chievs and stuff. But saying that isn't helping much so lets just do a list of pros and cons. Cons first. Cons:- uses GFWL- that glitch with rubbish on the road that normally should just bump from the car but that one critical time impales your car thru the middle and makes it vault into the air when you could have got that new lap record or won a hard race.- online races are either stomps or annoying- not the best graphics, but good enough- you might not like all the modes of the game. personally i think stunts are fun in between some normal races with friends. Not a fan of the derby mode, timerun or unbalanced online games.- way too much nitro as defaultPros:- you can overshoot the bowling lane to spell ""BO...NG""- the commentator in stunts when he gets all excited - seeing a ragdoll AI driver overtaking your car briefly as you hear the car had crashed behind you- half a lap behind when only 2 laps remain? NOT a problem. You might still win.- getting that flatout (doubletap throttle and hold) turn in the curve going exactly as you wanted - playing close races with friends and then continuing racing online together against the world- old but still going strong. same applies to game.- more fun than many other racing games out there. the pioneer of derbylike racing games.- no cliché storyline, just start racing and have fun. - do you prefer to race on gravel, at racetracks or to demolish a shopping mall with your car? Look no further.- match options are ok and exist. typically put 100% upgrades, no bonus and half or less nitro + only half damage and it's pretty cool. If you like arcadeish, not too serious derbyracing with some amount of destructive environment with a flair of stunts, sterotypical AI characters, non-copyrightinfringing carbrands and something slightly more than flatout 2 i'm not sure why you're reading this after watching the trailer, just put it in the cart already you scrub.8/10			",83,3,6,3,3,0,12

Review of Flatout: Ultimate CarnageUltimate Carnage is a remake of Flatout 2 so if you're wondering which one to get, get this one - it offers everything Flatout 2 offers and more. There isn't much to say about this title - it's simply an amazing game.Cons:- You need a Windows Live account for the multiplayer.Pros:- Stunning visuals.- Responsive and enjoyable gameplay.- Appropriate music.- Offroad tracks and tons of destructibles (Including your opponents).- Career mode, multiplayer as well as a pretty fun ""Stunts"" mode.Conclusion:Flatout: Ultimate Carnage is a must for any fan of the offorad racing game genre. It's what an offroad racing game should be - I would go as far as saying that it's better than some of the more recent racing titles.			",203,26,19,21,7,3,23

												+ Lots of game modes including a (sort of)campaign, custom play, online, party mode and carnage where you can do stuff like high jump, football, pure destruction racing/derbies and more+ Physics and graphics are excellent(nothing fancy but it plays very well)+ Catchy music that can get boring after a while but you can just disable it and play your own+ Adrenaline!+ Many different leaderboards to compare your best times and scores with the world+ Many cars including different colours+ Many tracks+ Servers still online+ Barely any bugs at all(I've noticed maybe one or two in total)- GFWL...!- Upgrades in the campaign are terrible- Unfair AI further in the 'campaign' - even when fully upgrading most cars they(AI) WILL be faster than you(this is most noticeable on tracks without many turns)- Game can get boring after a while after you've completed all the solo things- Not many playing online(usually one or two people/groups at any time, when I checked)Nothing else I can think of at the moment but even before I bought this game for a second time from Steam I had put at least 100 hours into it, even though I've always had many other games I could've been playing instead(which i didn't because this game is great!)8/10			",1763,682,71,270,242,30,324

												The game itself is fantastic - best racing game I ever played. The focus on destruction is hilarious and fun. Some of the music is great too, especially if you like hard rock / metal.However, when you first start the game, it won't work work. No error message, it just won't start. It deserves a thumbs down for that alone. To fix it, you have to install Windows Live Marketplace (WLM) a.k.a. Games For Windows Live (GFWL) first. If you sign up for an account you'll be disappointed, because GFWL insists it needs to download an ""update"", but then says ""Can't download the update. Make sure that you are connected to the internet"", offers a broken ""support"" link, and forces you to sign out of GFWL. This problem is caused by Microsoft, but the game developers have refused to fix it for YEARS even though they keep trying to sell it!Since you're signed out, you can't play multiplayer and more importantly, YOUR SINGLE PLAYER PROGRESS IS NOT SAVED on exit; you'll be left with nothing unlocked so you can only play the initial maps. I've experienced the same thing on two PCs, one running Win7 and the other running Win10, and before that I was completely unable to make this game run on another Win7 PC.Edit: Edit: other reviews say Ultimate Carnage is the same as Flatout 2, but sadly it's not. The gameplay and maps ARE almost the same, with only minor improvements, but the graphics of FOUC are hugely improved over FO2, the user interface of FOUC is much more polished, and the soundtrack is new. I hate that I had to switch to FO2, though FO2 is certainly still fun.A couple more things: (1) even broken I still would buy it when it is heavily discounted, as the initial maps are fun and there is a party mode (turn-based multiplayer stunts) which doesn't have any upgrades to lose on exit (but might be too challenging for actual parties). (2) The mouse cursor is broken in GFWL; use the keyboard to navigate it (Tab, Enter, Esc and arrow keys) (3) Microsoft somehow offers two versions of the GFWL installer (gfwlivesetup.exe) in different places and I tried both of them on Windows 10. One of them is 70 MB and is self-contained; the game is incompatible with this copy and WILL NOT START. The other is 628 KB and downloads the rest of itself. This copy worked for me on both Win7 and Win10 (Sorry for not offering a link, as I lost track of where I got it from). After installing it, don't worry about logging into the marketplace, it is not necessary.			",108,18,7,9,1,0,9

												Probably the most under-rated racing game ever. My favourite game. Since Flatout 1 & 2 on PS2 (also available on PC), and no FOUC on PC! Do no purchase FO3: Chaos & Destruction as this is not made from the same company. But yeah, this game has countless hours of fun, online and offline! Unfortunately will be going offline in a few months due to GFWL disappearing! But still, single player is always fun. Definately retained it's value for a reason.			",39,1,8,2,5,0,3

I already have the CD of this game that cost me 5 bucks, but quit storing my progress when Windows Live shut down. Now I have the 20 dollar Steam version that does the same thing.

												First things first; I can't review Flatout 3 because I only played it for 3 minutes, and I've already uninstalled the game, and it's not worth re-installing just to play it enough to be able to review it. So I'll leave my review on that here to say that it's the worst driving game to ever exist.But, FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage is extremely fun! I remember a few years back, I was in year 10 at high school, and FlatOut 2 had done the rounds on people's USB sticks. So a lot of us were playing LAN (is that still a thing?) battles of FlatOut 2 demolition derbies, and I absolutely loved it.If you've played that game and loved it, you'll love this... mainly because it's basically the exact same game, bar a few changes such as better graphics. AI players are the same, FlatOut mode is the same from what I remember. It's just updated a bit. Oh well, still a great game. Buy it! And don't buy FlatOut 3! Even ignore the ultimate FlatOut bundle. It's worth paying that little bit extra to say that you never owned that piece of garbage.Oh, and also, I've had no loading issues or any crap with this game, even on Windows 10. Ignore what the negative reviews say.			",83,8,41,6,15,2,7

												*****EDIT: This game was tested on win 8 and win 10, with no issues at all.*****Ahh, good ol Flatout. Where do i start? This game is insanely fun for the guys who grew up destroying ♥♥♥♥ as a little kid, thats for sure. Me being one of them, i was introduced to this series years ago thanks to a free demo on the Playstation Portable, and i fell in love with the game immediately. This is basically flatout 2 with updated graphics and much better features. I know i only have a few hours in but ive been playing this series for years, so i dont want any of the crybaby ""you only have a few hours"" guys. Anyway. For the people who dont want to read on, here are the ""down to earth"" pros and cons of this game: Pros:- Fast, intense gameplay- Online play- Graphics- Physics Cons: - Games For Windows live (you may want to read further about this)- Few online players- AI is very hard to beat in some races- Car always feels like youre going to lose controlOk so, as you can tell there are good parts and bad parts to this game. The physics are realistic as an arcade racer can be, and they may just be the best racing physics ive felt before. Cars have weight to them, you cant hit that tight corner at 100mph, stuff like that. That being said, your car always feels like its just going to ♥♥♥♥ itself up and fly off the road. Realistic, yes. But still a little hard to drive unless you have an xbox controller to make fine adjustments while turning (i dont think gaming wheels are supported in this game). The one and only BIG issue with this game is the useless software called games for windows live. This game WILL NOT start unless it is installed. Many negative reviews are talking about this, and i will tell you how i fixed it. When you download this game, it has everything you need to run it. The GFWL is in the downloaded files, its just not installed. You need to go into your steam apps folder and go to this games folder, then run the ""xliveredist"" app in the support folder. That will install GFWL. Next you need to start your game up and either sign in using an existing xbox live account (needed to play online) or make a local account that will not be able to go online. Its insanely stupid, i know. Its not as hard as people make it out to be, however. Even after you do all of that, there arent very many people that go online anymore (side note, add me if youre down to play online).  The AI is hard to beat in most races and it will almost always keep you on the edge of your seat while racing, because every single AI racer has a chance to get first place and you arent ""guarenteed"" a win like most racing games, you actually have to earn it. The game states that it doesnt support integrated video cards, which isnt true as i can run it on my laptop with that. It runs like straight ♥♥♥♥ though unless i am on my desktop, as this game is somewhat graphically intensive. Anyway, this game is my favorite racing game and i will reccomend this game to anyone and everyone. Try it, it is great.			",70,8,14,5,7,2,2

												Pretty addictive gameplay. Cars feel like they have real weight, to the point that my fingers hurt from steering after an intense session. I went from this to Burnout for a minute and it felt like going from driving hyper-fast tanks to toy cars. Here's my complaints:-The color pallette is straight out of Quake. Wish it was a little less muddy. -The music is awful. I wish there was an option to change it out. If you like radio hard rock you'll like this. I do not. -It's sometimes difficult to tell what piece of debris is going to turn into a major wreck vs act like flying scraps of paper. Nearly everything in this game is destructible and debris stays around, which is fun but sometimes the physics are unpredictable.-Games for Windows Live. If the service is dead, why does it still sign me out of my Xbox when I play this game?Other than those complaints, I really enjoy this game. I only tend to like arcade-y racers, like Burnout and Project Gotham. This fits nicely in there. I bought 15 games or so recently and this has gotten the most play.  ",339,116,10,50,36,6,66

												The best racing game I've played, on any platform, in thirty years of gaming. The cars have weight, the graphics are clear and crisp, the environments are realistic and destructible, and there are enough game modes, single- and multiplayer, to keep you hooked for a long time. According to Steam stats I've logged up 400+ hours. 'Nuff said.			",1559,639,96,144,109,17,200

												Flatout Ultimate Carnage looks better and plays better than any of the titles in the series.

												I'll recommend this game to those who love arcade-style racing with a twist of destruction. Not only you get just pure racing, you also get these mini games which are enjoyable to play. The vehicles look very decent, even if they look like a utterly mess. The soundtrack is very outstanding, it keeps you movitated in annihilating your competitiors from the road or anything that stands on your way. My rating will be a 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To me, this is one of the best racing/crashing games there are. I can say with confidence this game is a lot better than Burnout. Although burnout paradise might seem like the best crash and do work games out there, Flatout Ultimate Carnage does give it a solid challenge. I like the unique approach that was taken towards the circuits. It is a little slow going at first as the cars do not have that much power, but over time when certain upgrades kick in and money starts flowing, so do the hits. I find the challenge to get to first place is fun. If your like me though and like smashing cars instead of racing, you still get your fair share of credits towards savings for a new car or improvements to a current one. At first (as I've said) when you play the crashing is slow, but upon purchasing your second car (venom for me) you'll get into some fun crash dynamics. If you go fast enough and hit a stationary object hard enough, your character will come flying out of the car. Yes, you lose time and maybe your place in the race, but you get turbo the more time you are air born! Unlike burnout, this game strives on continuous hits. In burnout, you hit a car once and you are able to send it flying. With Flatout, you're going to need a better reason to send someone on their way. Hits are decent when racing throughout on straightaways, but coming up on a turn serves the best opportunity to deal a lot of damage. Nitro is available and refills every successful hit or jump that is performed. Nitro adds that sweet satisfaction when coming into contact with another car. The animation and feeling they have created when coming into a collision especially when holding the nitro button down, was done absolutely right. One player racing modes do not feel like a grind and the thought of boredom doesn't dare prod it's head.... until you complete the 3 racing classes and the last ""open"" class is available. By then, unless you are a hardcore fan, you may stop playing with such a dedication. A great addition to the game was the mini-games section which includes derby's, launch your guy out of your car into bowling pins, launching your guy into a soccer net... you know the regular stuff you see in the news paper saying that video games take it too far. The mini-games add a great depth to the game, and offer an alternative to racing. Absolutely nailed it here. The AI is also a dangerous threat at any time. I thought I was crazy, but some of these buggers will go off course then come flying back in off a jump. They all feel different and they all feel like they want to race. They do of course, want to hit you, but it doesn't seem one sided to the point where the player is becoming frustrated due to being targeted all the time. The graphics are appropriate for a racing game, neither over the top or too cartoon-y. The fact that they made it possible to destroy the starting gate is amazing. There is a lot of breakable and explode-able objects found throughout each map. This alone makes it stand out from a lot of other racing games. Sounds are good overall while crash sounds are seem to be on the spot while engine sounds are satisfactory (and vary). Music seems to be really heavy into the pop rock.FOR FUTURE FLATOUT GAMES : The only way they could have made this game better is adding local co-op into the mix. There is a two player mode in the mini-games section, but no one likes passing over a controller to play. Having multiplayer online should be mentioned as it ran smooth for me when needed.RATING : rock-SOLID 8.0/10Gameplay B+ Story / Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B Overall  BScreenShots :The AI sometimes for fun likes to hitch a ride on someone else's carThe map designs are quite unique and have a lot of hidden paths within themI'm really not joking when I mean the AI like to get creativeI just turned slightly and next thing I knew, I was getting smashed If you hit something hard enough, your character goes flying from your windshieldAt the start of every race, a flying camera takes you around the track to familiarize yourselfWhat I like about the game the most is that the environment can be broken and manipulated Alternate route part 1 Alternate route part 2.

												Flatout UC is still one of my top 3 racing games I have ever played <Kudos to Brad for recommending this btw>.So why do I find it sooo much fun?Game has been designed with collisions in mind and if you time your nudges or just flatout rams correctly it can give you an advantage to help you win - cool.Love the physics - cars just feel right in how they handle,slide,how you can nitro out of corners to save them etc.Cars have damage models and can be destroyed - sweet.No noticeable rubber banding AI. A real pet peeve of mine is when a racing game constantly puts the AI on your tail regardless if you are smashing the race or playing like a dweeb.Track design - just sublime. Sensation of speed - great. Cars are good , great throaty engine sounds.Graphics - still look nice today (2017 running Geforce 1080 GTX in 1080p).Cool rock music tracks that fit the style of the game perfectly.Game modes Race,Derby (think destruction derby :) ,Time trial and also a whole lotta mini games that are also enjoyable (some are hard!)What a shame that you need GFWL to play this (I use GFWL but I don't have multiplayer activated so I'm not sure if multiplayer works through GFWL or not)This is just what gaming is about to me Fun,challenge,replayability etc.Played using a PS4 controller with  DS4 windows 100% functionality like a 360 controller.Make sure in DS4 you have ""Use Dinput only"" selected AND you have in Big picture ""Use ps4 controller selected.Wala!

												FlatOut 2 was a great followup to the original FlatOut. It didn't take itself seriously and had nice graphics and style to boot. In 2007 BugBear decided to tweak it, repackage it and call it Ultimate Carnage. It's basically the same game but with some added modes and upgraded visuals. There's better textures, water, debris effects and reflections on the cars themselves. On the audio side the soundtrack has been replaced with lesser known tracks but they're mostly good although it gets repetitive after a while.This is kind of a tough game to judge. It's fun, entertaining and has a lot to like but if you've played FlatOut 2 before then you'll feel more than a little sense of Déjà vu. It has the same cars, same tracks, same game engine and even the same physic glitches. It's pretty much FlatOut 2 with some new paint and chrome which is more than a little disappointing. Fans of the series would eventually get a FlatOut 3 from a different studio but the less said about that the better. ",52,4,4,0,1,0,2

												It’s the spiritual successor of Rush. It’s Mario Kart for almost grown up adults. It’s the racing game for people who find continually trying to drive the perfect lap in Forza or GT tedious yet kind of sort of actually secretly like it. I am a Forza/GT fan who typically despises games like Need for Speed, but I loved this.There are some annoying things like Microsoft basically holding you hostage nearly forcing you to make an account in order to play the damn game. Or the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port aspect – all menus have prompts like press ○A and the mouse curser isn’t even supported even when friggen annoying Microsoft menus pop up in which you really need a damn mouse. On the plus side it supports non-Xbox controllers.That being said, it’s really a decent game. The racing aspect is super fun and it controls well although there’s obviously a bit of plasticity as it’s a smash up racing game. You’re encouraged to run into other players and take high risks in order to get more boost as opposed to just straight racing, so go ahead, have another one and drive sloppy. There’re plenty of upgrades for cars albeit not as in depth or complex as Forza or GT. There’s a good amount of cars as well so you won’t get bored; there’s always something to look forward to.And to top it all off there’s a ridiculous arcade and mini-game section where you’ve got to do silly things like make the biggest crash and fling your driver as far and high as possible. This section is particularly fun when you are too high/drunk to actually race.In summary, despite it being poorly ported and having Microsoft’s greasy finger prints all over it, I strongly recommend this game to anyone who wants a fun and ridiculous racer. Having not played any of the other ones in the series, it seems like Carnage is all you need. Apparently it has virtually all the features of 1 & 2 and more and it doesn’t blow barnyard animals like 3. Cheers. ",132,22,5,14,29,0,14

FlatOut 2 patch?I played the hell out of FlatOut 2 & remember playing Ultimate Carnage a fair bit as well but I stopped playing because I'd felt like I'd already done this before. I tried playing today (10/12/2016) & the game just doesn't start up anymore.... Found out its a Windows 10 issue that you need to download & install Games for Windows LIVE to fix....passI Googled the differences between FlatOut 2 & Ultimate Carnage and it turns outUltimate Carnage has:- Improved graphics & physics- A couple of new event types- No new tracks- Games For Windows Live (for online play & non steam achievements)- No LAN play- Different music- One new mini-game- Carnage Mode (standalone section for the mini-games where you can win medals)- 11 opponents (FlatOut 2 has 7)Having said this I'd personally stick to FlatOut 2 if you’re looking for a Single Player racing experience without having to deal with Games for Windows Live. If you want to play Multiplayer Online I remember only finding a few people so I don't it’s worth it for that either. 6/10FlatOut 2 > Ultimate Carnage ",588,106,24,58,52,6,99

												So I recently bought the FlatOut: Complete Pack which came with every FlatOut game. I had already spent a good 1/3 (give a retake) of my childhood playing FlatOut 2 on my PS2. I played all of the other FlatOut games that I had just bought and it came down to this game. Now I have a fairly modern computer which can take most games fairly well on moderate settings with around 30-40 FPS easily and I was hoping to find a FlatOut game that was better than FlatOut 2. When I got into the game (after the setups) I was immediately lagging very badly. I went into the config and toned down the settings wondering why a FlatOut game was actually running bad on my computer because every other FlatOut game ran perfectly on extreme settings. So I get it to a moderate frame rate and to my surprise I figured out that this was a totally kick-♥♥♥ HD remake of FlatOut 2. . This game looks absolutely gorgeous and it kept it's same physics and everything from the original game. Although I don't like the lack of cars, this game feels like it was made for a next gen console, it looks that stunning. They made the models and textures so amazingly gorgeous, the cars actually look REAL! I absolutely love how they kept most of the original cars from the original game. One thing that I wish they would have done is upgraded the player model, it seems that the developers just used the same model as the one in FlatOut 2. I also wish that they could have stuck with the original soundtrack as I grew to love that soundtrack very much so. I would DEFINITELY recommend this game to anyone looking for an HD remake of FlatOut 2 or just a great racing/derby/ragdoll game. I will definitely be playing this game a bit more often and I will give this game a solid 9/10.			",146,26,9,12,5,4,7

												I really enjoy this game, it's a great arcade racer with beautiful graphics and some really fun physics. You have a selection of different race modes to play, like demolition derby, time trial, race - and 3 different tiers of cars to enjoy as well: derby, race and street. Each tier gets progressively harder (and faster). I have only scratched the surface of it so far, but am enjoying what I have played so far.It's similar to the older Burnout titles in the way it plays, with awards given for dangerous driving and smashes with other cars. When crashes happen (and they do - a lot), they look outstanding. It's far superior to the Burnout Paradise (also here on Steam) - so if you have to choose between the two, get this instead.Jimbo Rating: 7/10			",134,5,5,9,5,0,4

The whole series is my favourite arcade racing game for years, and nothing seems to change it.			",390,117,27,79,52,1,87

												The game uses Games For Windows Live. GFWL has been shut down, permanently.ONLY buy this game if you intend to play the singleplayer. There is no LAN multiplayer, and since you can't log into GFWL with anything but an offline account, multiplayer effectively doesn't exist.Thanks, Microsoft.			",329,55,5,29,30,2,35

												Not too many racing games grab my attention, this one is an exception.  Leans heavily into the arcade side of racing games, it has gobs of debris and destruction everywhere as you drive (kinda like how they would lay out food in front of Jerry Springer guests for them to throw at each other).  This game really succeeds at keeping you on the edge of completely wiping out at all times (challenging) yet not becoming frustrating.  The races really can get your heart pumping esp the ones in the 'race class' cups.			",126,29,3,4,18,0,32

												I bought this game in 2009  (cd version), and it was a blast, i always liked Flatout, especially FO2, this game brought a new life to FO2, making the best destruction racing game ever made even better, its perfection at its finest, the graphics were the best, and the addition of the carnage mode made existing modes more fun... the only thing that i missed was the LAN mode for multiplayer but online was good. After 7 years the game held up kinda well, the graphics continue to look good (needs a bump in refletions and some textures), but what made the game lose some of its goodness was Games For Windows Live, i can't log in with my old account where i had all my progress because many changes were made in microsofts accounts and GFWL is abandoned and never got updated to accept those changes, so i was forced to make a new account to be able to play online, not a big problem for me, but Games For Windows Live DRM will eventually disappear (in my belief very soon) leaving the game dead, one solution would be integrating it with steamworks but Strategy First doesn't do anything (tipical from this publisher), and the developer says they can't do anything because they don't own the rights to do such thing (similar story happened to FO2 when Gamespy closed and left the online multiplayer dead to this day)... but if you are not concerned about the future of the game and your pc supports GFWL (some w10 users report not being able to use it) i recommend getting it, as it is a great game and in my opinion a must-play game.

The racing is fun and competitive, Carnage races are even better. There are Demolition Derby's although not as fun as NCGs in my opinion. Also the stunt games are great.

												The second best Flatout game after Flatout 2.This Flatout has improvements from Flatout 2 like Deathmatch Derbies with power-ups,4 new drivers,new cars for Derby class.New modes.Some drivers from Flatout 2 has improve their skills like Frank Malcov.He  still is the worst driver but he is trying hard to get the podium but sadly for him he  get wrecked because of his bad skills and the other drivers (inlcuding me).Also i found  stunts to be more harder in UC than in 2.Also CArnage you will get fun and nightmare with this mode for GOLD hunters like me.Only the con i can give is you need Windows Live to save your progress or at least an offline account.The price 19$ is too high for an old game,i got it in summer sale with 2,84$ and i was very happy to see it in sale.Also in game is achievements but it will  only unlock if you have an ONLINE Windows Live account.In the rest the game is ok.Also the soundtrack is nice not like Flatout 2 ones but still a nice one.Final note:8.5/10			",205,33,16,6,21,1,9

												It's a great game but I can't recommend it because it doesn't run out of the box, and doesn't tell the user what's wrong. To get the game to work on Windows 8.1 and 10 you need to manually download and install ""Games for Windows"" from the official xbox or microsoft site. If you don't, the game will not start and not even pop an error message. If you installed ""Games for Windows"" before, or if it was installed by a different game already, you won't have this issue.Windows 8.1 has been out for well over a year. I cannot recommend a game where the necessary 5 minute fix to the installer has not yet been done.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												*I don't have much time but I had this game on XBOX*Overall it is a great game and I think it is the best game in the series. Graphics where good at the time and still look alright today. One think about this game is setting it up for the first time. You have to make a Games For Windows Account which is  pretty difficult considering it isen't really supported anymore. Just to launch the game you have to have it installed but you can still get the installer from the Microsoft website. Once you get into the game you HAVE TO connect to Games For Windows to save your progress. Which isen't hard but it has to happen lol. As far as gameplay goes it is like any other racing game but I think it is better in a way. There a minigames and stuff like that and has come to be my favorite racing game ever.

												Probably the worst FlatOut of the series.It feels like a fail Burnout clone without any of the things that make Burnout fun.The music consists of maybe 10 tracks of completely bland, forgettable rock music.The challenge mode was ok, but it consisted mainly of boring time trials with a couple of the ejection challenges. Unfortunately most of the best career cars were only unlocked from from getting first place in some of the challenges.In the carreer mode, you can get boost from jumps, ramming into debris (sort of), or other cars, but strangely enough, not drifting or near misses. The problem is that ramming into things obviously makes you slower, with the chance that you can randomly fly off the road for each thing you hit. The physics are pretty bad sometimes, and combined with the stunning no-steer effect from hitting items or other cars can make things really frustrating.When there's loose crap littered all over the road, do you drive through the large boulder, or the small cardboard box?If you chose boulder, Congratulations! Boulders usually plink harmlessly off the car, while small cardboard boxes can cause you to fly up into the air and flip several times before landing you in a nearby field.Because boost is only gained in so few ways, it can make it hard to catch up to first place when in second if there are few jumps on the map. If there are no cars to slam off, and all the loose junk has been knocked out of its initial position (and therefore gives no boost when you hit it agian) and there aren't any jumps, it becomes amazingly hard to catch up to the Designated Winner (the suspiciously fast AI car that rarely gets touched by other cars and can go through most debris without losing any speed)Now, I understand that stunning (hitting another car with yours and temporarily disabling their ability to steer) is pretty much a given on battle racing games that don't use weapon pickups. What I don't understand is why in this game, you get stunned as well when you hit them first. I can't count how many times I would tap another car, and we would effectively be stuck together, as we couldn't seperate unless either I hit the brakes (the AI never did) or we both flew off the road together. This happened with the AI as well, if they got to close to me, they would not try to turn or follow the track, they would just follow me off the edge of the road/into the wall/field/whatever. At one point I had 3 cars stuck to me, one to the left, one to the right and a car that was sideways in front of me that couldn't or wouldn't move until the whole mass just crashed.Even runs on maps I knew well and was winning would be ruined if I hit some random thing like a trashbag in the road the wrong way.Another problem is that ""Reset Car"" only worked when it wanted to. Sometimes I could reset right after getting spun backwards or flying into a pole, other times I would have to sit and watch my car flip 20 times in the air for 10 seconds because I ran into a tiny bit of debris.During the final hours when I was truly getting bored, the game consisted of driving a bit, getting completely jacked by the AI cars or some random trash, and restarting the map. Over. And over. And Over.It felt like the debris added lots of randomness without adding any fun.The game is probably more fun with people, unfortunately, the MP is dead.Combine all that with the fact that the game is infected with GFWL, earns the game my final score of:STAY AWAY!

Every race is a chaotic mess of debris and hazards and I absolutely love it.That said, the one thing that has always bugged me about this game is its *awful* music. They really couldn't have picked a better lineup of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bands. The worst offering is by Manafest, a song so horrible that I always have to devote some focus while going as fast as I can to changing the song. Fred Durst would have been a tender mercy compared to the lead singer of Manafest, who has a voice that I will sum up thusly: nails on chalkboard.And I find myself spamming the change song button pretty much constantly, because too stubborn to bother with MP3s. However, you can turn the music volume down to zero, keeping all other game sound effects intact and allowing one to use the steam music player, which eliminates all bad in this game in one stroke.Easily one of the best racing games on offer from Steam.

												Pros: Fast paced gaemplay with lots of actionCars can be upgradedDecent selection of carsGreat variety of stages which include stunt stages like basketball, baseball, darts etc..Graphics are pretty goodHas demolition derbyAI is actually fun to play withCons: Upgrades for cars are basic, (muffler does nothing to the sound of the car, body upgrades are not seen on the actual car)Cars explode when they get fully damagedCars drive the same when fully damaged as they do when not damaged at allterrain does not have deformation. Would have been nice to have mud pits that affects cars and slows them downThe sounds of the cars are very muffled, even at full volume a V8 should be louderWould have been nice to have real damage, flat tires, blown rads, broken tie rodsThe controller is not customizable, reverse view uses the analogue stick. All in all, great game ",77,20,9,9,17,0,6

												FlatOut это дерби- гонки. Где все вечно взрывается, крушится и ломается. Графика и физика в игре отличные. Очень много видов транспорта. Даже присутствует грузовик и школьный автобус. Кроме гонок и дерби в FlatOut можно поиграть мини игры: боулинг (Вылетаете на большой скорости из кабины и збиваете всем телом кегли), Дартс, Футбол и т.д. Большое разнообразие трасс. Вероятность вылететь на трассе из лобового стекла очень велика. Конечно всю игру словами не описать, так что попробуйте поиграть в неё сами. ",406,83,17,38,13,2,42

												Flatout Ultimate Carnage gives you the opportunity to create absolute mayhem in what is a decent racer. As well as racing, you build nitro by crashing into the scenery and anything in your path. Including your opponents. It is easy to forget about the racing and just cause carnage for the sake of it. It won't win you many races mind. This game is a mix of styles. Similar to Burnout, handling is more rally style (quite a bit is off-road) and the power sliding and nitro not unlike Ridge Racer. Whilst this makes for a good fun racer, some of the racing can get a bit 'flat' after a while.The AI in this game is mighty impressive, Each car has its own driver and personality and it often feels like you are racing against humans.

												FlatOut UC is by far the best part of the series. This game is a lot of action and fun, it just doesn't get boring. The campaign will give you 8-10h of gameplay, and then there's still more to do. The game is based on Flatout 2 (basically the same, but with better graphics, more opponents and a few more things), so if you already own it, better wait for a steam sale to buy UC.

												FlatOut UC is by far the best part of the series. This game is a lot of action and fun, it just doesn't get boring. The campaign will give you 8-10h of gameplay, and then there's still more to do. The game is based on Flatout 2 (basically the same, but with better graphics, more opponents and a few more things), so if you already own it, better wait for a steam sale to buy UC.

												I was debating a long time wether to give this game a positive or a negative review. Decided to go for a negative after going through all the bad things, here are the pros and cons.___________________________________________________** CONS *** Dumb AI - It will constantly ♥♥♥♥ itself over, and sometimes take your poor soul with it. It has basic ""rammimg/disabling"" tactics, it doesn't consider other AI's, so 2 or 3 AI's might try to block you from both sides by driving steering to your path, and create some sort of useless triangle of infuriating, frustrating blockage that will keep you all at 70KMPH or less. It's easily fooled in derby mode, you just drive around in circles and watch them destroy eachother, and then butt in for the win.* Heavy and wonky props - for some reason there are big @ss props on the map, if you're unlucky to hit one of them, you will probably stop to a halt/sub 20KMPH, and should probably press R to restart. It could happen any time, no matter first or last place, first or last lap, you will get ♥♥♥♥ed by it. If it's not big enough to stop you, it's small enough to bounce like a feather OR jam under your car and SEND YOU FLYING/SPIN YOU OUT OF CONTROL. These are way more common than the heavy props, and just as annoying.* Bad physics in general - Let's say you master the evasion of props. Congrats! now you probably want to slam people the hell out of your way. It will probably not end well for you. Steer clear of people. ( Ironically ) especially in derby mode.  If you try to steer people out of control by slamming to their back sides, they will rotate 90 degrees and you will stick to their T bone like a MAGNET. Don't try to slam people from behind in lower speeds - you will have no effect, and you will stick to their back side like a magnet until you slow down or pass them somehow.* A terrible difficulty curve - 1st level is easy. Picked the Mustang, left all my opponents in the dust, no upgrades, no nothing. 2nd level? ♥♥♥♥, I couldn't even catch up to them. Had to buy another car and heavily upgrade it to stand a chance, and get mostly 2nd/3rd places ( thanks to props, too ). I'm dominating the side challenges because all I have to do is drive in circles, if not, AI will gang up on you and will ♥♥♥♥ you up in a minute.* GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE - The world's most terrible, teeth grinding, usless sack of ♥♥♥♥ DRM makes an impressive comeback to this game. If you can't run the game at the first time, it's probably because you need to install Games For Windows Live. It's that terrible. The installation for it is in the game's library somewhere in your Steam library - common - steamapps - FlatOut : Ultimate Carnage. When you enter the game, just go as guest. I couldn't remember my ancient account. You probably wouldn't too.* Mediocre graphics - This is a 2008 game. 2008. Having played the 2009 hit Burnout Paradise, this looks like a bootleg from 2003-4. At lease it got impressive ""destruction"" mechanics? kinda. It just creates more crappy glitchy props. No thanks.________________________________________________________**PROS*** Easy to get driving mechanic - Gotta give it to them, at least the driving is pretty fun. Drifting is easy to master, all is arcadey as it should be.* Great soundtrack - Classic ""let's **** some ♥♥♥♥ up"" rock music. Fits in great, some of the songs I will be listening to again outside of the game.* What looks like 12-13 hours campagin - It's kinda good for an old game. Yeah, you will spend most of the time trying to redo failed races thanks to stupid AI and terrible props, but it's arcadey and pretty fun.* Good maps and nice scenery - well, nice 2004 looking scenery, but you get the point. Maps are well designed ( better without the terrible props )._________________________________________________________CONCLUSIONRating - 4/10Recommended price - 4$ or below ( on deep sales ), usually 20$Shoud you buy it? - If you're into arcade racers with ( potential ) derby elements, sure. I couldn't do any derbying because it's all bugged to hell. I wouldn't get it if it was above 5$.			",192,29,8,16,21,5,18

												I honestly feel the original version of this game is better. Sure, it has a few extra additions and slightly better graphics, but the original just feels better for some reason. I'd ACTUALLY recommend the original FlatOut 2, you guys should go check it out, it's pretty great.Really, i feel that 12 player is a bit excessive, and its not like there is gonna be any racing competition because everyone is smaking into eachother in the back of the track. At least in the original, i was usually competing with 2 or 3 other people (Jack and Sofia mostly, i swear they had some good AI), in this version, i usually see only 1 person on the minimap keeping up with me.I also think the soundtrack of this version is absolute trash, while i thought the original had a fantastic soundtrack. In all seriousness, the only thing i thought was better in this version was the graphics, but not by much. Go buy FlatOut 2 instead.			",117,20,4,14,12,0,5

												Yea. So I gave this game a second chance since my last review was negative and I wanted to see if I was wrong.I caught the game cheating so many times i have forgotten them all.For example in one of the race tracks on the left side of the road is a ramp on a truck that you hit and the jump gives you a turbo boost. I'm in last place, i hit the ramp and get boost, none of the other cars hit the ramp but somehow they all stay ahead of me and im still in last place with a heavily modified car.I want fun not frustration. just deleted this from local content.

												The game runs good overall & has quickly become one of my favourite racing games. The only issue I have with it & its a big one is that you absolutly cannot save. No option what so ever. It depends on an old windows live account which you can still create but the game itself cannot access the services to downlaod your profile. Good thing I bought it on sale because I would be way more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off if I had paid the full price. But that said I am still ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off.			",13,0,1,0,1,0,1

												A downgrade in beauty and a downgrade audio from the original Flatout 2. On top of that you have the horrid Games For Windows Live experience. Just get Flatout 2 instead. I love Flatout2, so I wanted to check out the ""upgraded"" version of it. All this seems to offer is more simultaneous cars on the track, but so many nice little touches are missing, it feels like a downgrade for sure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wanted to love this game and for the majority of the game I did. It has a lot of the right elements, done the right way, which result in a great racing experience, very playable.Then you get to the difficult end of the spectrum.In the dictionary, under the term ""nerfed"" should be a picture of this game. Regardless of whether you manage to get the top cars, the level of AI, physics and performance changes that occur during the highest races drops the playability level down to all but unplayable. If you have learned the way to properly play and control your car through the various races and levels to get to the end races, you understand the elements around you and the other cars, how they behave. Unfortunately most of that information will do you no good, as the laws of physics suddenly stop applying.Enemy cars will go from wrecking as you pass them to rocketing past you at 200 mph+. Pieces of paper in the road transform into massive obstacles able to flip your car high into the air on impact. Your car begins to perform like a ford pinto missing a few cylinders: One moment, it handles fine, the next it has no throttle response, no turning control or no brakes, or slides radically sideways if you so much as look as the hand brake button. Step on the gas pedal....it might respond, it might not. If you are really lucky, the wind from a passing car will make yours veer into that oncoming building corner or tree, stopping you instantly.Don't worry, however, as things will revert just as quickly back to how you have come to understand them, once 3 or 4 of the opponent AI cars have passed you by, leaving you wondering just what the heck happened. You will have time to think about it after you lose the race again.In playing this game, or any game, it is understandable that things get progressively harder. However, the ""playability"" of this game goes way down when the changes that make it harder are such that they are so readily apparent and unfair. You end up thinking ""whoa, what the heck just happened?"" a lot. Things happen which are beyond explanation and which are beyond you have any effect on whatsoever. There is no counter move you can do, no way to affect change in the situation at all. The outcome just changes, and the only thing you can do is keep the gas pedal down and watch the other cars pass you by.The advantages given to the environment and AI cars in this make it a very different game at the end. I loved it up to that point, but there is no way to play against what you know about the game being useless to you when you are playing it. How do you race if gravity or the laws of matter change instantly for a few moments here and there, but never in your favor? There is no way to fight that. If you win, it will most likely be because of some freak bit of luck.I don't expect it to be easy, but making it seem impossible by yanking victory from your grasp unfairly, and very visibly so, earns it a bad review.

												I wish there was like a 50/50 button for reviews. This game is just that.. 50/50. It can be fun but it can also be extremely boring and repetitive. The carnage mode is kinda fun but some of the goals are just nutty. If you are looking for a racer with a slight change of pace then give this a go otherise its probably worth a miss.

												A cheapened attempt at regaining the play of its predecessors, Flat Out: Ultimate Carnage boasts only better graphics. Car handling, and especially, Force Feedback, are pathetic. The cars feel more like driving bars of wet soap... while the Force Feedback has been reduced to 'rumble' in your steering wheel or joystick... A pathetic excuse considering the fun its former incarnations yielded. Buy at your own risk. I did, and regret it still... $5 or not.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

FlatOut 2.5This game is essentially FlatOut 2. Same cars, slightly different tracks, same game modes. I realise its a series, but its pretty much the same game. Steam overlay is messed up too. Anything you type in overlay is typed ingame, making it everytime you send a message with the enter key it un-pauses you game. Also, why is the AI in destuction derby mode now impossibly hard? It's gone from being too easy to being 'you're the only car in the game we're gunna ram' and you end up dying within 20 seconds.Unless you've never played FlatOut 2, I wouldn't recommend this game.But if you're new to the FlatOut series, its one of the better ones IMHO.

												FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage is essentially a high-definition update of FlatOut 2. There are a couple of new gameplay modes and some technical improvements, but that's about it.Still, the game is enjoyable. It looks a lot better and the physics have been beefed up, which leads to lots of big crashes. The FlatOut 2 campaign was fun, and it's still fun here. The minigames return intact, and they're more addictive than they should be.FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage is a Games For Windows Live title (you can't run the game without it), and there are over 40 achievements to try and get. Some of them are pretty difficult to obtain, so if you like achievements FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage has them.FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage is best-suited for people who never played FlatOut 2. However, if you don't have FlatOut 2 anymore and want to play it again, Ultimate Carnage will do the job.			",907,212,80,89,93,14,172

												Ultimate Carnage was a port of FlatOut 2 for Xbox 360, that got ported back to PC with minimal changes in comparison with the original second one, but still amazingly fun. The biggest change was more drivers on tracks and greater graphical details. I would recommend Ultimate Carnage to everybody who loved the first two games and to people who just like to destroy stuff and enjoy one of the best PC racing games. It runs flawlessly even when it is, like I said, double port. Too bad it is the last FlatOut to this date. NO! Just forget that there was anything like Flatout 3.

												I've only played 2 and a half hours of this game, But i am making this post to help anyone having problems playing this game with a controller like i had.  ( At the bottom of this past i will leave a review of the game. )How to fix:1. You will need a program called better DS3 if you are using a ps3 controller. ( Not sure if the program will work with PC controllers. )2. You go to the opions and find controller configeration, Click that menu and once you have done that, At the top you will see keybored, Go right and leave it set to Xbox 360 controller, 3. Enjoy the gameI really just gave up and thought that there was no controller support for this game. But after looking at what i wasn't doing rigt, I felt like a jackass. I hope this fixes any controller problems you are having. Might as well review the game down here of course. This game is easily a 9 out of 10 game. Being one of the last good flatout games, It really stands out on gameplay. It's a upgraded version of flatout 2. And it is worth the money. As long as you like slamming cars off the road and looking at damaged cars, This game is for you. The flatout complete pack is on sale right now. The only one out of the pack that sucks is of course, Flatout 3. But i think you already know that game was a failure from the start. But i haven't really got down to the pros and the cons of this game yet because of the fact that i only have 2 hours of gameplay from this game. So far it is a blast playing it.			",29,1,5,0,3,0,0

												Any of guys remember Destruction Derby? Those boxy cars with first ever destructible physic. That thing was off the hook. INSANE. I used to get lost in that game for week. Police would come looking. I'd hide for one more race. It was awesome.Guess what, Flatout as savored some of that taste will serve it to you on silver platter. Yes, this is road rage at its finest with fast nitro fueled racing, cars shattering into pieces and derbies taking place around every corner. All of this is garnished with pop rock and served with a side dish of a very entertaining car Olympics type of game mode that could in fact serve as a standalone game. So what you have in there is very sturdy racing game with an acceptable career mode where you upgrade and buy new vehicles as you progress into faster tiers. A party game where you can  take turns in driving your car into a wall and seeing how far or how accurately you can launch the  driver through the front window (a lot fun! there is bowling, curling, ski jump and tons more); this works in single player as well.And last but not least a multiplayer game where you can race your friends and/or trash their cars on the parking lot.Fabulous stuff!So if you are in for a solid arcade race and appreciate good destruction. You pretty much can’t go wrong here.NB! Shortcuts and destructible environment is included!8/10			",536,158,35,44,48,7,108

												I bought this game shortly after its release in 2008. It is a masterpiece and made me absent of social life and human interaction for two and a half years. Unfortunately, the game isn't as populated as it used to be, and the small player count is based off people of the same nationality and have their own lobbies. They don't usually want other players (especially of different nationalities) and tend to kick you from their lobbies. Other than that the game is outstanding. 10/10			",48,1,10,1,4,1,4

This game is basicly a slight remake of FO2, but with more racers,  Difrent songs and some gameing modes like beat he bomb and carnage mode. Plays great.  their are only 2 problems i have, 1 is not really a problem but the sound track is kinda Meh to me but that is just my opinon, I created a custom sound track playlist on  youtube to give it a more Flatout feel. the 2nd gripe is the windows live thing. it was a gauntlet for me to get the save feature to work. and with windows live i cant merge my offline save with my Online save. so be aware of that when your playing.

												This is such an amazing game! In my opinion, it's underrated and not as popular as it should be. The game is fun, action-packed, and so addictive! It's is similar to FlatOut 2, however, this game has more game modes and updated graphics comparing to FlatOut 2. And surprisingly enough, the online servers in the game are still running in Ultimate Carnage! The thing is that you will need to download the Games for Windows Live client (remember GFWL back in the days?) because the online servers are run by it. All you need is a Microsoft account, and you can play online. There are a few people playing the game, but I've never come across a time where there was no one playing at all, so there's always a lobby to join. Any who, the game is tremendously fun! It's like Burnout, but different in a few aspects (more realistic, but it still maintains the massive mayhem that it contains) It's an action racing game, and the crashes and wrecks are what the game are great at delivering. There is also stunt mode, which is familiar to FlatOut fans as this mode has been around since the first instalment in the FlatOut series. You are in a huge and vivid stadium, and you are to send your driver flying through the stadium and hit bowling pins, dunk slam them into basketball baskets, hit them with a gigantic baseball bat, and so much more! The stunts are so fun and addictive, and absolutely hilarious because the way the characters move like ragdolls and fly around are funny! There is also a derby game mode, where the cars are parked on the edge of the arena, and they are going to drive and wreck each other, which is fun and addictive too. If you are a multiplayer type of person, then I'd still recommend this game to you, because it's so awesome when it comes to multiplayer (servers are still online). You can do demolition derbies, races, and even stunt modes in online. And the best part is doing stunt modes with other people, as you can see each other flying like ragdolls XDThe areas and tracks are also nice and interesting. You can drive on off-road tracks, or race on oval tracks... or even drive through trolleys in malls! The tracks are fun and entertaining!If there was a bad thing about this game... it would be that the cars are too sensitive and slippery comparing to other racing games. They can be brought to a halt by simply hitting traffic cones and chairs.But any who, it doesn't bother me at all, as there are simply too many pros. Brilliant game, brilliant franchise! I'm excited for their next game: FlatOut 4!!! :D :D :D			",16,6,6,3,0,0,2

												I am not much into racing games, but once I saw Flatout in action I had to try it out. It is not simple racing game, but destruction race as well, you do not need to finish 1st, it is enough to crash and destroy all opponents - therefore you are only one in the race and you win automatically. All the tracks are full of destructible objects and they look different in the start and in the end, when all the rails, trash and destroyed cars of opponents cover the track. Plus the soundtrack ♥♥♥♥ing rocks.			",203,56,9,27,27,2,24

												Ultimate Carnage was a port of FlatOut 2 for Xbox 360, that got ported back to PC with minimal changes in comparison with the original second one, but still amazingly fun. The biggest change was more drivers on tracks and greater graphical details. I would recommend Ultimate Carnage to everybody who loved the first two games and to people who just like to destroy stuff and enjoy one of the best PC racing games. It runs flawlessly even when it is, like I said, double port. Too bad it is the last FlatOut to this date. NO! Just forget that there was anything like Flatout 3. IT IS TERRIBLE, PLEASE DON'T TOUCH IT!			",1233,365,56,175,145,19,175

												I've played 100s of racing games, but none keep me coming back to it like this one, my steam time does not justify the real game time i have on this game, I've spent 100s of hours on the 360.If you want a fun racing game, with damage, this one is for you, i find simulation racing games very boring. I can play flatout for hours on end and not realise time has passed.Probably the best destruction derby type of game on the PC.Note: for people moaning about Games For Windows, you install it from googling 'Games for windows' takes you to an xbox site.

												FlatOut Ultimate Carnage is a driving game for people who don't like driving games.  It doesn't allow you to tinker with your gearing ratio and your spoiler angle.  It doesn't offer accurate simulation of the performance of real-world supercars.  It doesn't even pretend to have realistic physics.What it does do is let you go fast and smash into other cars.  A lot.  I enjoyed this, not quite so much as I did the competitor BurnOut series, but enough to give it a thumbs-up.  It's easy to get into, and dishes out over-the-top high speed mayhem for the non-gearhead.			",307,157,5,35,18,1,31

												I've played the whole Flatout series, and this one is by far the best. Best graphics, more cars. Race grid went from 8 to 12 cars. I prefer the racing modes over the ""novelty"" stunt or demolition derby modes, but to each his own I guess.The cars all have unique characteristics as far as speed, handling, nitro, etc, and are nicely modelled. The crashing and environmental destruction is satisfying. The ragdoll physics are amusing and sometimes hilarious. Quite a fun game overall if you like racing and wrecking.My few beefs with the game are as follows:-Car customization could be a bit expanded. I think you get a choice of one of six colors of the same basic paintjob for each car.-Car upgrades are a bit primitive and limited.-Multiplayer is dead, I've never found an online game-Could use more variety of tracks.-Object physics are a bit unpredictable and can be frustrating. You can sometimest plow right through a steel beam with no problem, ten seconds later you hit a potted plant or a lawnchair and it launches your car 10 feet in the air.The biggest problem I have with the game is the following: Once you have earned and upgraded all the higher-end cars, it's not much of a challenge to beat the competition quite easily. I often run the crappier cars just to have some challenge involved in winning races, with the better cars it's just way too easy. I wish there were a way to adjust the AI maybe 5-10% faster in order to get some closer racing.In spite of the negatives I have listed, I still rate this game quite highly for fun factor. Learning the fast lines around the tracks and working your way up to earning enough money to buy better cars and upgrades is an engaging challenge. (although some cars can only be unlocked by winning special events).The problem is that once you've got all the cars and upgrades, you kind of reach a plateau and there's really nowhere to go from there, it becomes too easy.Bear in mind that this review is focussed on the racing aspect of the game, others might have a lot of fun with the derbies, stunts and special events. Despite my review including a lot of negatives, they are overall minor in nature. The game is very fun, and can be quite humorous at times. I guarantee you will get some good laughs out of it. It includes easy arcade style car handling, enjoyable drifting, jumping, crashing, ragdoll physics and environmental destruction. It's crazy good fun, in spite of it's few relatively minor flaws. If you enjoy high speeds, crashing, explosions, and sending your competitors through their windshields headfirst into a concrete bridge abuttment, this is for you. I recommend it highly.Edit: I've seen a lot of reviews bashing this game due to GFWL causing the game to not run. I simply downloaded the latest iteration of GFWL and have never had a problem with it since.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ultimate Carnage is probably what second game should've been from the beginning. Comparing to the FO2, they made graphics look really good. They fixed water, tuned picture saturation, removed bad post effects, added normal mapping, improved overall detailing of the original tracks... and it looks seriously good.The bad thing is that the core gameplay and physics are taken directly from FO2, which is boring BurnOut wannabe (unlike the original game). It seems like they actually tuned handing a bit, so the car is an actual car now and not a paper box on a wheel, but I bet it will get worse as you progress. Honestly, I didn't play much, just a few cups, but it's just enough to say that the game is better than FO2, but still not good enough to get positive. It's funny how this game has 83 versus 92 of FO2. I guess that is related to GFWL used in this game, but you can create local account and I don't really care about multiplayer. So after playing 2 classic FOs, I tell you go play the original one. That one kicks yass.			",603,148,26,66,36,11,80

												The Windows Live thing is nothing to concern yourself with. When the game starts, it logs into Windows and then the main menu appears without a hiccup. The achievements you receive are actually recorded through Windows Live. So again, there's no problem here, you can play with or without it.The graphics are NICE, man! MUCH better, shinier and sharper than I would've imagined. I have it turned all the way up on every setting. It looks gorgeous; much like the hi-res screenshots you see up top (not that video or any YouTube video you come across). It'll leave tire marks on the road when you turn sharply or burn rubber. When the gas station gets ran over, the fireball blast is really sweet. The car models were done with care. I love the junkyard body and paint jobs. Excellent lighting and visuals that can compete with any ENB+SweetFX modded Grid game. The collision damage is NOT on par with Grid, let's make that perfectly clear; but it does get the job done.The framerate is spectacular. There are no FPS drops and the game runs smooth as butter. Even Grid has a problem with this from time to time on the best systems (google it). Not this Flatout version, though. Every race has been nothing short of fulfilling track drama at the highest of speeds. Only Gas Guzzlers races are faster...and more...insane!Customizing your ride is awesome.Every upgrade has its positives and negatives; but I didn't realize that at first. I tricked my first ride out with all the upgrades, thinking it would be able to just drift to victory with ease. Nope! It was too heavy and beefy to carry all the speed upgrades. So it turned out to be a general ride instead of the General Lee. It gets me 4th place with consistancy. Thank of it as an M1 Abrams in a muscle car frame...with speed enhancements.The Tracks! Here is where the game comes alive. The tracks run more like Gas Guzzlers Extreme; so you have variances throughout the race. I don't think I've ever made the same lap twice in a single race yet. Almost everything is destructible like in GGE but even more so in this game. I also like the fact that they incorporated ramps to lauch off of. There are times when I really do feel like Beau & Luke Duke in the General Lee. My ride is flying 50 feet off the ground with my confederate flag license plate hanging on by a screw and mud spewing from my undercarriage. We race (and crash) through dirt, asphalt, water...highways, lumber yards, farms, back roads, suburbs, cities...with a combination of each at times. It's awesome, man.Flatout: UC is what racing should be. Just a few good ol' boys & gals racing cars meant to be raced!I still find glee in telling my buddies how I hit a wall, flew out of my front windshield, ragdolled on the cement, and got ran over by my own car moments later. I love this game. You will too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This crazy physics destruction derby arcade racing title provides more evidence that its developer, Bugbear, might hate cars almost as much as it loves making games about cars. The numerous ways the vehicles in this game can be dented, smashed, crashed, crumpled, and shredded may well make petrolheads weep tears of dismayed sadness, but then, that's the fun of it. The entertainingly visceral physics engine, that sees cars and environments alike torn apart violently at the slightest touch, provides a fascinating look into what the Burnout games might be like if cars were continued to allowed racing after the otherwise fatal takedowns.It refines and expands on Bugbear's previous FlatOut game exponentially, which makes it slightly infuriating that there are unforgiveable surface blemishes on an otherwise impeccable arcade derby racer. The inclusion of Games for Windows Live has basically all but guaranteed that the online community for this game is dead as a doornail, but perhaps worse, in my opinion - and certainly more invasive - is an absolutely wretched soundtrack. Seriously, I don't think I've come across a worse use of licensed music in a videogame. The cheap, faux-metal pop-rock that found its way into this game's soundscape is utterly painful, and I had it switched off almost immediately. I don't quite understand how these music choices were made, save that they were the only they could properly afford. At any rate, the music is abominable, and while I must stress that, that is my opinion, I will also stress that my opinion is, in the case, unquestionably correct.			",472,79,20,30,23,5,47

												When first playing Flatout: Ultimate Carnage, there was a lot of similar feel to Flatout 2. The interface is the same, the driving mechanics are about equal, maps are the same (for most of them), but the graphics are improved and a lot of little things were added. I feel like this is a better and updated version of Flatout 2. And I would say that this is the best of the series, and next in line is Flatout 2.			",84,5,7,9,3,0,4

You smash your car into the one in front at full speed, and one of you is guarenteed to fly out the windshield. You hit a wall at full speed, and you car is going to be much worse for wear.Soild 9/10. Music is awesome, gameplay is awesome, car damage is gorgeous.			",196,22,5,21,26,0,23

												Very good racing game. If you previously owned FlatOut 2 and enjoyed yourself, this is a nice little refresh which adds a few tracks and restructures the campaign mode. You get the same fun physics and chaotic racing as you did in the original, and despite being more than five years old, it holds up reasonably well graphically.It can be a tad frustrating at times, with causing huge crashes and winning the race becoming mutually exclusive, but overall it's a barrel of laughs.The soundtrack leaves quite a lot to be desired, however. You'll have heard most of the songs in the game within an hour of playing, most of which aren't particularly great, say for a few exceptions.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great remake of the FlatOut 2 classic - improved handling and physics making racing much more comfortable, and I really enjoy having 11 competitors instead of the original 7. However I have a few specific problems, firstly being the reset input. In races it can theoretically be used at any time, however in derbies it takes upwards of 15 seconds to reset after being flipped or getting stuck on other cars, leaving plenty of time for other competitors to smash into you multiple times. I was hoping this would have been an improvement from FlatOut 2, but it wasn't.Secondly, health seems to have been decreased, or smashing and crashing deals more damage. I'm not sure which one it is, but it's too simple to wreck an opponent. In 4 lap races on wide and open tracks, a third and sometimes a half of the racers are wrecked long before the race is finished.Finally, this game is way too easy. The improvements made were necessary, but it's also taken away the challenge of the game. I'm halfway through the Race Series with 100,000CR, enough to buy a new car and all the upgrades with 40,000CR in the pocket. With health decreases and damage increases, I average around 15 slams and up to 3 wrecks per race, while finishing in 1st place and 10 seconds ahead of 2nd place, and with the rewards money is very easy to accumulate.FlatOut 2 was my childhood so it's great fun to play through these games again. I'm thoroughly impressed by Ultimate Carnage and will continue to play it for hours upon hours, and others should too. Recommended for mindless smashing, crashing, explosions and complete destruction, this game doesn't disappoint.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is imho the best attempt to revive the Destruction Derby franchise in a decade. More games have attempted this succes formula, but more often than not the quality of these games is crap. Here it's fun to ram into vehicles and destroy the environment while the racers crash out of the cars. The racing mechanics are decent enough given the nature of the game. There's minigames too which are a fun change from the derbies. All in all a fun game that shouldn't disappoint.Warning: you need to create a WindowsLive account in order to play, which is annoying but takes about 3 minutes.PS: Don't think of getting FlatOut 3, which came out later. It's really bad.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you dont own any of the ""Flatout"" series I can save you some money. People buy ""Flatout 2"" and then ""Flatout ultimate carnage"". Thats a ♥♥♥♥ing no brainer as ""Flatout Ultimate carnage"" IS ""Flatout 2""!  ""Flatout 2"" was awesome but the graphics were nothing to write home about. So They developed ""Flatout ultimate carnage"" to bring the graphics up to date. So ""Flatout ultimate carnage"" is basically  Flatout 2 ""HD"" version. The graphics are ♥♥♥♥ing awesome and they have tweaked the mini games. When Steam does it's deals you'd be crazy to pick Flatout 2 over ""Ultimate carnage"" Dont say I didn't warn you.Damage(in all aspects) is a huge part of the game and is what makes it stand outIt has enough customisation that actually makes sense to add to the game and to keep pushing you on.

												Hard to decide if I want to recommend this game. Here's why :I've played FlatOut 2 for ages. And I love it.I'm playing FOUC these days, because achievements, 11 opponents (yay more victims \o/ ), carnage mode, nice graphics.And it's good. It's really a good game.Unless you played enough FO2 to notice some details:Let's start with the elephant in the room : no mods. Though I can live without it, I like my AIs with a bunch of muscle cars from the FOJ packs. I don't feel like it's that necessary because of all the cars I've seen in the mod packs, my favourite remains the Bullet GT (ultimate car in the game).Until I made my way to the Bullet GT, FOUC was simply FO2 with better graphics and more AIs.Then, I unlocked the Bullet GT and lifted an eyebrow. Bugbear, Strike One for changing the visual design of my favourite car. Oh well, I suppose I don't care, I use the bumper view anyway...Then I upgraded it to the max and noticed the top speed attribute is a mere ~6.5/10. Wait what ? oOYup, that's the worst point in the game for me.I loved playing FO2 because of this car.Because it was stupidly fast.9.8 topspeed, 10 acceleration, 4.3 handling, 10 nitro0 to 342km/h in a ridiculous number of seconds with nitro.Basically a rocket with wheels. And so rewarding when you master it.So I went for a test drive with my new FOUC Bullet GT. Obviously, I nitroed all the way to ... 280km/h and sighed.I'll also mention some tracks have been ... reworked (aka ""made easier to race"")Basically, I don't get my fix by playing the Street Grand Finals with my faithful Bullet GT as I did on FO2 on numerous occasions.Hell, I can't even drive on walls anymore =((fixed physics or simply lack of speed, I'm not sure)So, I guess I'll recommend the game because it is good in its core and has more gamemodes than the original.But I'll advise to also get FO2 (or only FO2 if you really have to choose)I'm kind of sad that I cannot get the best of these two in one game...

												Do you like a good racing game? this is the game for you! chaos and destruction on the racing track, blast you fellow racers out of the track in a power blasting racing game! The game is just very good, every single one in the series (except for FlatOut 3, it has diffrent maker that just f*ck*d it up) Ultimate Carnage is the same as FlatOut 2, but then with more racers, 12 instead of 6. I give this game a 8.5 out of 10!			",66,2,5,7,3,0,14

												Best. Racing. Game. Ever. Well, since Need For Speed: Porsche Unleashed anyway. The physics are incredible, from the weight and handling of the cars in general, to the way they drive on various terrain types. The audio is amazing, changing the sound from hard revving engine and squealing tires on asphalt to dirt and gravel hitting the undercarriage when off-road. The AI drivers are a nice mixture of fairly easy in the beginning to downright dirty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s at the end. The 122 hours I have on record at the writing of this review are all actual play hours (vs. the game just sitting, open and ticking). If you like racing games at all, this game should not be missed. Make sure you have a game pad or wheel. Keyboard can be done with reasonable success at first, but unless you have a gaming keyboard that allows more than the average simultanious key presses, you're going to hit a wall (pun intended) about a third of the way into the game.

												I strongly recommend all of you buy this game. FlatOut Ultimate Carnage is better in all ways, graphics improved (everything), better musics... i just say, flatout 2 is more for PS2 age, one year later, came the UC, made for PC, seriously, im not joking, you will feel a huge difference playing this game.

												Finaly a game true 2 the first Flatout. Its all about steering.Best way to get it to steer is get a fast as possible car en get a new set of tires as fast as you can.I love how easy I get an other try. Same menu layout but more options.I do hope 2 find some people that have the game 2 just 2 see if I can race against them and NOT die.I was surprised I needed a Microsoft Life account though. But Player3767340988 is an odd name, so I went and changed that 2. ",60,14,14,10,6,1,5
