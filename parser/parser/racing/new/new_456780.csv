												One thing to note this is my opinion and this is a game from the guys who made ride and in the end that got little to no support, go ahead look it up on steam.Kind of an introduction to bike games for me but as far as i see it, a fitting one. Things to note+Pros>Large selection of bikes >Beautiful courses >Fantastic physics >Great history +Cons>Somewhat choppy(Framerate issue, it might be just me but if not i'm sure this will be fixed soon)>Character models (lacking diversity in clothes,faces and everything in between)And that is it fantastic game for any Ducati and bike racing fan alike, offers extensive history on Ducati and a rich selection to choose from. solid 8.5/10			",286,34,15,19,27,2,20

												Polished Ride game. Could have been sold as expanstion or nor, price is very good for the content. (Ïf you don't like Ducatis there is no point, maybe) The historic bikes sound good, look good... and vibrate :-DTracks are also polished a bit. ""Historical"" Milestone ""style"": Interface is basic: you have no time to read text about the bike on loading screen (SSD drive here... not a console :-)All oponents have same number plate and dress the same..Online is same basic amateur interface. Why not use Steam/Halflife interface?But again: it is great fun and instructional once the flag goes down :-)PD: I wonder if ""Wales"" track is somehow realistic. ""Stelvio"" (been there trice) is a pastiche, and it is in ITALIA. A shame! Historical tracks like old Assen, old Le Mans, Monjuich etc would be EPIC! ",54,0,18,1,13,0,2

												- 39 Bikes (Ride: 113 newer without DLC`s)    only Ducatis from 1950`s to modern and victory era    (125 Gran Sport Marianna ..-.. Desmosedici GP15 Andrea Dovizioso)- 13 tracks (with mostly 2 different layouts) (Ride: 15),  Miami and Saltlake is missing and instead of Milano you get Misano- Historic Career,  you start with the 50`s beginnings and unlock newer bikes with winning medals   thats the interessting part, to ride nice, old bikes too, get infos about their history and progress in the ages,  if you already own Ride its just a big Ducati DLC,  if you doesn`t its a historic, less expensive alternative- Cons:  !!!  weird  laggs !!!  while constant high fps, ruin the whole game  ( if they fix it, i change to  positive)    -all AI riders look the same  edit 28. juli:  not a single update since release			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you have Ride this is basically the exact same thing except you can only use a range of Ducati bikes.If your an avid fan of Ducati, its not bad for 25 bucks...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A good racing game at a low price.many bikes, a good choice of tracks, graphics enhanced compared to Ride and very funny to play.It runs very well at maximum settings on a GTX 970			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is basically a improved Ride game using only Ducati bikes, less content but also cheaper, and since milestone is the only developer that make games around bikes with good gameplay and physics for PC, is a must for any bike lovers, the only thing I can really point out is the lack of improvement in the computer AI.They reuse some Ride tracks but still enough content for its price, and the possibility to drive some iconic bikes even just in virtual reality, is just fun and the history and evolution of Ducati is just a bonus.

												Do not recommend, it is lackluster with plenty of camera bugs. Even though it is essentially just a standalone expansion of RIDE, performance is horribly bad and stutters a lot, even on computers that used to play RIDE perfectly well.Audio is dead silent, no soundtracks during races. Bikes not exactly modeled the best.To see more about what the game actually looks like you can refer to my review video here :

												Let's review this work that seems to have all Milestone fans up in arms about Ducati 90th!Let's address some complaints.-I get it, to others it doesn't feel like a full game.-Bikes are lacking.-Tracks are lacking.(I don't understand this one!)These are the main issues I see, so before I start this review I wanna say this, keep an open mind.From what I know, Milestone had a contract with Ducati for this game, and I feel like they did what they needed.Now the review.It's a barebones version of RIDE, but to say it's just RIDE all together, or a RIDE Expansion sold off as an exclusive DLC is just stupid.The game has had several tracks worked on from France, Wales had a fix to make the track feel more immersive in its hills in the game which lead to flat out speed and aggression with full control. Imola was thought out again and doesn't feel as tiny as the Imola in RIDE, it definitely has the length I expect from it now.And if you know the series well enough you can find the other differences for yourself.Bikes, the count came out to about 36.Sure, we can work with this is DLC.Camera bugs have been fixed since the release, and everything seems to be working fine.All together I think the people who want to bully the game really don't have many valid points.The game as of its fix is flowing a lot more smoothly, and if you love RIDE I suggest you grab this when it goes on sale, yes! On SALE.It's a great game, and I can say I enjoy my time on it, I plan on keeping it as a game I go back to for the sake of playing with old classics, & Ducati exclusive bikes. Personally, I feel it was only right to put all the classic bikes together in one game until Milestone can think of something like a RIDE Classic Edition or something else that addresses other bikes from the past.Do I truly think the game is worth it, or am I just trying to sell you to increase sales for Milestone as they're a smaller company?I do! I think this game has its own place in the world of Moto Games. But I see where people get upset at something like this being linked in as its own title, BUT! That price tag says it all.What are the things I actually enjoy and think others would too?The tracks are remastered, surely not replica tracks though, we might not ever see a track that's an exact spitting image of any IRL tracks, that's why it's nice to have devs who think out of the box to bring unique things to tracks.The bikes yet being a small list still give you something to mess around with. And something I didn't touch on much, the slip boxes are bigger in this game, so any newbie can easily find it to be enjoyable.Even though the list is small I can see Milestone tossing in a DLC Pack or two to try and increase the games lack of bikes.All together I love the feel and for anyone who doubts on it, give it a go before you judge it based on others reviews. It isn't the ""Full Package!"", it's simply something to say congrats to Ducati.Leave it at that.You'll enjoy it if you're a true fan of RIDE, and you won't be too let down. But don't expect big things, just enjoy it for what it's worth. A few new tracks, a list of tracks that have been changed a small bit, a nice compact bike list, and a game that'll satisfy you for a small bit of time.			",14,2,10,0,3,0,0

												Feels unfinished; the first race in Historic Tour, all the bikes and riders look exactly the same right down to the racing number, suit and helmet. It's a clone race as you can see from some of the trailers and screenshots in the store page. Tutorial also lacking in voice over which is present in previous Milestone racing titles. No wow factor intro video either. All signs of unfinished work or budget or time constraints.

Graphics wise looks good and plays smoothly even though my laptop doesn't meet the minimum spec. Music is as cool as in Ride just different which is good. Ride has better content and its replays are more interesting to watch than clone races.

			Nice crisp graphics but... the bikes are all the same. Note that YT flags this as having copyright content (sure there's music in it but not like it's a big hit or anything and even if there's a big...		

Only get when discounted 'coz it's non-essential; just a niche collection of bikes for fans, collectors or history buffs. Recommended only for bike fans or those who prefer a mix of street and track races. 6/10Why in the world do we have clone races? If this was real how to determine who is in what bike? GPS and RFID? These sort of clone races are also present in Test Drive Ferrari Racing Legends but not all of them are clone races. I suppose it's the same here too. It's just so bland to watch, quite underwhelming actually. The worst aspect of it; all the same numbers. At least make the numbers different. Look at Project CARS Pagani Edition; different models different liveries and it's free!

In DUCATI 90th Anniversary you get mostly quantity over quality. Yep 6/10 only, mediocre effort.Still recommended though 'coz it's the only one with antique models.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
