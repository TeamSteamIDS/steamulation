												Wish they would make another game and if they do make more cars like Migets. Dwarf cars, Late models, but over all I love the game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the best speedway game i ever played also i would be happy if another gaming company makes a sprint car game which is better because not much sprint car games are out and not much company makes them. ",45,2,3,1,5,0,2

												I personally love dirt track racing and try to watch as often as my local track run. Sprint Cars Road to Knoxville is a great game IF you love dirt track racing. The game is very specific to dirt track fans, and while not perfect, is the best one that is still readily available. Although to be frank, some playstation 2 models were indeed better games but are harder to get ahold of now. If you cannot race with a keyboard, I wouldn't bother because some seem not to work. The car sound can occasionally be garbled, and sounds bad but isn't detrimental to the gameplay itself. Also, I've seen many gripe about creating drivers taking forever. You don't have to, as long as your driving you can hire the cheapest driver and get to work. If you love dirt track racing, I think you'll find this game soothing enough to eat up some of your day.Good luck and hope this was helpful.			",2,0,2,1,5,0,0

												I enjoy this game a lot. My only negative that bothers me has to do with the audio, specifically with the cars; they sound garbled, hit-and-miss, inconsistent. I don't understand why this is the case and would hope it can be fixed soon please. But I still enjoy the game overall.			",5,0,1,2,0,0,1

												Controller support is practically non existant and game stutters.If you want a good sprint car game, find the sprint car/dirt track racing games from Ratbag games.... they're older but so much better than this...			",37,1,3,0,3,0,1

												Great game! i had trouble with the sound working right, but im a die hard dirt racing fan so i got over that real quick! Ai is okay sometimes, career mode youll pretty much win every race by laping everyone once or twice wish there was a little more challenge there but if you like dirt track racing this is the game! Fun game overall, out of the handful of dirt track games ive owned this ones right at the top.			",6,2,4,0,25,0,6

												This game being as old as it is could be a great game still . But it lacks any kind of wheel support .I have scoured the web for  files and there are no work arounds.wont even work with an old R440 wheel I have. If you are a keyboard driver you will love it			",74,7,8,7,18,1,1

												This will not work with a wheel (G27 anyways) and most other controls are very clunky or not working in Win 7. I did have the boxed version of this years ago and, at the time, it worked with a joystick controller but nothing has been done it seems to get it working right before they put it on Steam. It's old and used to be fun but considering the many other racing games (old and new) that work fine with Win 7 without problems, this is not worth the time or money. I bought, tried to get it to work with no luck whatsoever so I got a refund.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
