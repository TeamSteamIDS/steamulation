												Good racing arcade for F1 fans. But it’s only for players that are fond of arcade racing and F1. It of course doesn’t worth its normal cost. You should buy it ONLY on sale above 50%.DLC are unreasonably expansive! Especially China Track which is the worst DLC Track but the most expansive (LOL). But Europe, India and Canada are rather good. But anyway they are very expensive. Buy it ONLY on sale.Multiplayer isn’t the strong part of this game – many players has different problems with online mode, but it works:

												F1 Race Stars is ALMOST a very good game. But ultimately it is frustrating and somewhat lacking in comparison to other top kart racing titles. It is fun to play as your favourite F1 drivers in cartoon form, with lots of nice power ups, and some truly original and very innovative racing modes which keeps interest levels high. The graphics are quite good, though of course they are meant to be very cartoon-like as opposed to photorealistic. Overall, there's a lot of good to be said about the game. It is certainly a challenge!But here's the rub: the game is challenging in the most frustrating of ways. Firstly, there is essentially no difficulty level. The 1,000 vs. 3,000 cc only changes the speed of the cars. Facing the AI is like a baptism of fire. It is relentless, and one can win only with a mix of skill and luck (luck being by far the most important factor). I don't like to win every race, but when I lose I want to be able to remedy that by improving my skills. Not so in F1 Race Stars. You can be racing at your very best and come dead last by virtue of a bit of bad luck; likewise you can race like a drunkard and come first with a contrary amount of good luck. This, unfortunately, is a very nearly game-breaking fault. As a result, what could have been a classic kart racing title will be one to forget in comparison to a Mario Kart or Crash Team Racing. But all in all, it isn't a bad game. Fun but frustrating. 7/10.			",114,10,19,26,9,0,20

												Being a big fan of Sonic and All stars transformed racing decided to try out the Codemaster's version of kart racng.  There are definitely big pros and cons to this game and I hope they decide to fix these areas in their future sequel if there ever will be one.  Which I doubt since Grid series,  their signature line up is doing extremly well.  Which by the way am a BIG BIG fan of.  Unlike other kart racing games there are almost little to no drifting! Which could be good and bad.  Basically focrces you to pay more attention to lines you take in corner entry and exit.  Some may find this annoying and others might appreciate the challenge.Let's talk about the PROS of this game first+ Clean eye pleasing graphics+ Car damage and pit system+ Team play mode+ Price if you can grab it at 75% (4.99)+ Slip stream!!! (shake and bake)Ok the downside....- TOO MUCH DLC (seems to be becoming codemasters trend)- Online multiplayer is dead.  You'll need to get your buddies to play- Weapons were not very creativeOverall I am happy with my purchase and would recommend buying this game to any silly kart racing fans out there then immediately adding ME!!!

												+ interesting game/race modes+ great looking tracks+ good steering aside from- bad cornering mechanics- no slide mechanics which takes a lot of the fun and speed out of the game- not enough tracks to make them entertaining (only 15 + mirrored version)- demotivating and unfair power up system- long loading times (on SSD, probably due to some online features)- unskippable multiplayer setup cutscenes- no custom set up (no damage, no powerups etc.) available in multiplayer (only single track possible and that's frustrating due to loading times)- races can only be unlocked in carreer (single player) but are required to be unlocked if to be hosted in a multiplayer session- useless DLC (aside from the four tracks)To make it short, the races don't feel like a fun kart racer. Due to very frustrating power up and repair mechanics it is often luck and not skill. Boosting is only possible with power ups, boost jumps or specific boost sections in corners (not every corner though). You'll find yourself being frustrated instead of having fun a lot of times.It's a last resort buy for me - I recommend getting ""Sonic All Stars Racing Transformed"" instead. Alternatively you could just wait for a better game to be released on the PC - or just play the original: Mario Kart is still the way to go in this genre.			",768,213,44,98,87,13,116

												If you can get this game on sale, like I did, then it is a pretty decent time killer for a few hours (I recommend it on sale, but not if its standard price). However, the novelty factor quickly runs boring and there are a few issues with the game: it looks and plays like they tried to rip off mario kart, the boosters are ridiculous and can get you from anywhere, if you are dominating then it seems to rain a hell of a lot to bring you back to the field. If you like this sort of game there are plenty of levels and steam acheivements to work through, and if you are a fan of F1 then its a bonus novelty to have real drivers and teams (I am not).

												What make classic Mario Kart great? Seeing your skill and knowledge of tracks increase and slowly you start to win cups that seemed impossible.  When is it at it worst?  when too much luck is involved. Blue shell anyone? This game is all-in on the luck part. Tracks dont require much knowledge outside some basic shortcuts + key/gate locations and certain rare spots where you actually need to use brakes.  What decides the positions is actualy what you get for powerups. Torpedo or Teleport once or twice in a game and you are golden.  You better also know how to defensively use power ups also right at the first 1000cc cup so dont expect 1000cc to be the 'training wheels' cup. it is just the least broken one. Career mode is a mess.  You will be pressing restart quite many times during multi-track racing cups. Luckily the final order of drivers seem to be much more random than on Mario Kart where your main rival is faster than anyone else. Multiplayer is dead. DLC structure is a mess. Tracks as DLC i can understand but the rest is some of the most useless crap i have seen in a DLC. And the prices. oh my.  Time trial works. Thank goodness. F1 license in the game - has any reviews even mentioned it? must have been a good investment. ^_^  No difference to anyone. Does it work as a couch game? Yes. If played casually it is wonderfully goofy. The shortcoming start as soon as you try to seriously play the game. I rather study Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed more complex mechanics or just go back to Mario Kart rather than try to seriously play this game. I will be putting some more hours into this but it's clear already i can just forget about a proper career game and just play this casually. That way it's obviously been designed too.  4.5/10			",775,311,45,87,97,7,148

This is a cart racing game with real f1 drivers.Since this is linked to f1 there is no drifting so you'll need to use your breaks on turns or pump the gas also hiting the other cars drops your speed.You get 11+4 dlc tracks, 28 drivers in 14 cars in 1, 2, or 3,000cc.Each car is shared by 2 drivers and each car has a different ability, stuff like better boosts, more of a item, off road, and many more.Items come from stares on the track and give power-ups like, speed boosts, bubbles (can be placed behind you to block or shot forward & stops a driver), a shockwave (disrupts cars around you), a teleport (jump ahead a bit), a rocket (become a rocket and fly forward), rain cloud (slows) balloons (if hit will cover your screen with confetti), and a pace car (slows the head cars).Tracks have hidden paths (i think you need items to use some) and it will sometimes rain.Cars can get a boost at the start if you hit the gas right, and again sharp turns are hard with no drifting.Boost pads on the track charge up a battery on the back of the car before you can use it.Taking damage or hitting a object head on will damage your car and you'll be slower and handle worse until you can drive down a pit lane. The game is polished, runs without errors, and can be fun though i know some complain about the turning it wasn't a deal breaker for me also the purple car at the end has a off road ability so you won't lose as much speed when your off the track.The character motions are campy but they also give the feeling of sportsmanship and that they don't hate each other, also the opening race thing is skipable.The dlcThe 4 tracks are ok, not sure they are worth $5 each and if you want to see them i have all 4 in my video.As for the accessory packs, these change your skid marks (you wont even notice), what your tailpipe kicks out when you boost (you'll barley notice), & your horn (you'll notice this most and i can see people liking the air horn in the party pack)Though i didn't feel they give enough for the price (all 9 for $9).If it was all in 1 cheaper pack maybe but how it is now, i'ed pass.

												As Mario Kart 8 is coming out, many console gamers are poking fun at the PC crowd for not having a Mario kart... but in fact we kinda do, it is this game.It definitely has a few issues, but overall it is very enjoyable. the tracks are fun and well designed, and the fact that there are no crazy drift mechanics can actually be considered a plus by players.Sadly, F1 race stars does have issue with its online multiplayer, but if you invite your friends over at home, it is a great PC alternative to the kart-racing italian plumber.

												F1 Race Stars is one of my favorite racing games ever and it is in my opinion the 2nd best kart racing game ever made behind Mario Kart and I've played most games in the genre if not all of them.  I own F1 Race Stars for Xbox 360 with all the DLC and love it so much and missed playing it I decided to buy it on Steam.  The game its self is worth the full price but it goes on sale often enough that you can buy it cheap.  It's a very overlooked game that is very polished with great gameplay.  Please try this game if you like fun kart racing games or are a F1 fan, trust me you will enjoy it.			",203,50,27,9,21,5,16

												This game was quite the surprise for me... I was expecting it to be so moronically cutesy that i would find it unbearable, and yet it's actually quite an enjoyable game. Despite clearly being aimed at younger players, the game is actually quite tough, with the AI drivers being quite ruthless in their use of power-ups and short cuts, often resulting in you leading the race into the final corner and yet finishing 9th or 10th out of 12 racers. This can be rather frustrating but if you can deal with that, it's a fun game. I should point out that i only got this game as a result of it being free when pre-ordering F1 2013... I'm not so sure i would rate it so highly if i had paid the rather high asking price for it. The DLC (and there is plenty of that) is also rather over-priced in my opinion...

												I normally dont write reviews but... for this game i just had to! Because everybody has to know thats its totally extremly and absolutly... ♥♥♥♥. Dont buy it. Dont let the shiny graphics, license and comparison with mario kart blind you into buying this! Why? Because the game mechanics is bad. The team did really a good job on polishing the game. But the mechanics... for example, if you get hit by an enemy extra, you get a double punishment. Not only for the extra that hit you, but also your car is broken now and you drive more slowly. You have to drive trough a pit stop (normally around 2-3 on the map) where you lose AGAIN time to repair your car. If you add the pit stop you get triple punishment... wtf...It also has no kind of fun mechanics like in sega sonic all star racing or mario kart where you can use your skill to get extra boosts. Instead you have Kers... and Jump Boots... where you just have the possibility on some occasions by simple button releasing and pressing to gain an extra boost. Yay again... Please DONT BUY Save your money! I am Sorry for the dev Team, You did a great job with the game overall, but your game lead designer should buy any nintendo mario kart game to see what good game design for fun racers is.

												F1 Race Stars is incredibly shallow. For your full price you get a grand total of seven tracks with very little variation outside of them. It's a very fun splitscreen experience... that's better suited for a console. F1 Race Stars took plenty of chances but they didn't pay off and for full price you're going to be playing a flawed game that could have been more fun. This is made worse by the fact that the online is dead and the game has trouble reading multiple controllers at times. If you have four guys who'd like to play it and can get it really cheap on a sale, I'd say it could be worth a look at, but F1 Race Stars doesn't do anything for anyone outside of that small, situational demographic and that's just dissapointing.

F1 Race StarsA competent and challenging kart/arcade racerF1 Race stars is a Kart Racer/Arcade racer set in the 2012 F1 season with all real drivers and teams. The game is in the same sort of league as Mario Kart and Sonic and Sega All Stars Racing. Not quite as fast paced but at times more challenging.No drifting here, Unlike most Kart/Arcade racers where drifting is needed to win, drifting does not feature at all in this game. However you are required to approch corners with a more realistic racing line using your brakes. On kers corners you charge up your kers in the corner by keeping the car controlled and releasing when you leave the corner. If you go into a corner at full speed you will crash.All the usual powerups you would expect, seeking weapons, dumbfire weapons, traps etc.Pro's Fun challenging gameplay Lots of diffrent gameplay modes (slalom, Trophy, Fuel etc.) A good selection of circuits with nods to the real ones. For example in belgium Eau Rouge has been recreated. Official F1 Licence Lots of secrect shortcuts Each Team Has a special abilityCon's The cringe worthy race intro and podiums. Thankfully you can skip them. Red Bull is OP just like in 2012 (special ability ""Slipstream Boost"" = Unlimited boost's when not in first. Multiplayer matchmaking is essentially broken. (I have made a guide on how to fix this) Alot of racing can be based souly on luck rather than skill and can get frustrating on certain modes. For example ""Pure racing series"" no power ups and fragile damaged. The AI seems to very ram happy then its near impossible to catch upHere is my guide to get online if your having issues,

												If you are into games similar to Mario Kart, this game may be for you.But you can't drift like in Mario Kart, Instead in the corners, where you have to slow down significantly, it have a thing called ""Kers Boost"", and as the name tells you, gives you a boost, just charge it up by holding the W button (drop the W key and hold it again to get a bigger boost when you're out of the corner).MULTIPLAYER: If you want to play Multiplayer, just look at the community hub, you will see that there is a thread about F1 Race stars, and there you will see a link to a group with members that is playing F1 Race stars with each other, so if you want to play online, just request to join the group, and when you want to play, you can just ask someone in the group. (If you are 3 racing, the rest of the spots get filled with AI racers). You won't get anyone to play with if you just create a multiplayer game on your own.PROS:+  14 different power ups, also some unique ones:Safety Car - Slows down the 1st Racer.Wet Weather - Making it rain and making the ground slippery for everyone except for the one that used the power up, which get special wheels for the rain.Static - Everyone loses their current power up.Rain Cloud - Slows down the racer in 1st place.+  8 Different game modes+  If you get hit by a power up, your car get damaged and makes you go slower, if you get hit again, even more damaged, to repair your car you need to drive through a pit stop.Bad:- The teleport power up can be annoying, someone can teleport in front of you right before the finish line.- The DLC tracks are expensive, it's better to wait until they're on sale.If you are into Kart racing games I recommend this game.

												The negative reviews didn't shake me on buying this game as i thought it might have been a cute mix between micro machines and mario kart, and i was rightBut oh god does it ♥♥♥♥ you offIt is a struggle enough fighting against the controls (which you can't customise, oddly defaulted to left handed play)  and the turning offers no powerslide unless i assume you are using a controller, which puts you often at the pack of the pack. The catch up is decent the slipstream is effective and some of the powerups make it easy to recover from mistakes but if you are in front it is one of the most frustrating experiences.I keep racking my brain trying to figure out why these corners are physically unable to be made unless you ""powerslide"" (i.e braking until stopped and moving) or turning well before you would be normally instinctive to do so, The catchup powerups make it so the first place suffers the most while everyone else affected very little. The Safety Car powerup makes the first place and anyone catching up slowed to barely anything while the behind catch up and the Rain Cloud powerup is god awful, causing me to come second on the final strip in more than a few races. The damage system is innovative but in the end flawed as you are permanently slowed until you divert to a repair station, often longer than the actual track in it's own sense, just constantly punishing youThe graphics kept me entertained for the time i played and the little animations were pretty cutesy and enchanting but unless you are withering it out with a friend, pick up Toybox Turbos, another game made by the same developer which has the same arcadey charm but not as punishing and when it funnels down to it, it is actually fun to play			",294,77,18,29,23,5,25

												...... ... ... I'm done. I quit. I can't take it anymore.Pure Racing is the worst game mode I've ever played in any game, EVER. Spent two hours restarting Monaco over, and over, and over just so I could finish 4th. Despite the fact that it's IMPOSSIBLE to finish 1st in this gamemode unless you started first, somehow the AI that had won previous races also won again at Monaco and I ended up 2nd in the series. All that work, just to get my best possible finish of never-higher-than-fourth and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t AI wins, AGAIN. Once you strip this game down of all its mario kart clone mechanics, there is literally nothing left -- this game accomplishes absolutely nothing. I had already grown weary of these ridiculous physics at this point. You can't make any corner because you just drift back and forth across the track, sometimes completely unpredictably. If any of the moronic AI get within an inch of you, which they seem incapable of NOT doing, they will trigger an absolutely unforgivable knockback effect that COMPLETELY stops all of your momentum. Naturally, it affects the AI less than it does the player so navigating through the clusterf*ck of garbage AI seems perfectly legit. This is quite possibly the worst AI I've ever raced against in any game, at least in recent memory. Maybe it's just emphasized by the ridiculous physics which are, I suppose, designed to discourage less than optimal racing. Trying to retain a faint connection to real F1 racing, they make it abundantly clear that COLLISIONS ARE BAD, MMKAY. Be a respectful driver.. and wreck them with power-ups like a good boy/girl. However, optimal racing is an impossibility, especially when comparing a play to an AI. All of these problems are almost mute when a part of this merely acceptable Mario Kart clone. Then, strip the game down to ""Pure Racing"" and you just get slapped in the face with its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Unbelievibly, despite the AI never taking an optimal race line or hitting any of the apexes of any corner, they are still consistantly as fast as if not faster than the player, unless you rely on the ridiculous draft system. If you brake into a corner properly, you WILL get rammed from behind and your race ruined. If you try to carfully overtake an AI through a corner on the outside and miraculously don't get hit from behind or have an AI slow to a crawl right in front of you, then the car on the inside WILL turn into your line and ruin your race. So to recap, the AI never brake in corners and overtake you with easy, an often ram into you from behind. Yet, often times when entering a corner they will brake unpredictably and cause you to ram into them, even though they never brake. Despite the fact that the AI never take an optimal race line around the track, they make perfect time around corners, never missing boosts, while the player is in a constant struggle not to drift out of bounds while somehow managing to brake in a way to not get hit, enter corners in a way you can't be surprised by AI braking, or allowing any AI an opportunity to try and pass you on the side or enter your racing line. Honestly, even though this game is a Mario Kart clone I expected it to have a stronger more realistic racing feel than it does. Furthermore, the amount of control I actually feel like I have over the car feels about comparable to ice tracks in Mario Kart, but not quite that extreme.The power-ups lack any originality.Oh, and the pit stops, oh my god the put stops. I could rage about them forever, about how AI will go into the pits on the last stretch and still win or even pass me, how if I go into the pits I will get passed by 3 other cars, all this mostly due to the fact that some pits are LONG AF and waste so much time while others might even be faster than the main race line.. seems legit. Ultimately, this inconsistancy leads to times where the standard of not pitting on the last stretch ends up with you losing the race. So, just keep in mind that whichever decision you make is probably the wrong one. I would die for some online matchmaking to this game so that I don't have to deal with these AI, but I have yet to see a single person any of the times I've looked for a match. Perfectly decent party game -- it's exactly what you'd expect. I'm not disappointed with my purchase, as these types of games are fun just to mess around on. I'd recommend this game to anyone who is into this type of game, despite the fact that they are probably better off just continuing to play their kart racer of choice. Jimmy Johnson's Anything With an Engine, right?Edit: Just spent the last couple days playing Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed and it blows this game out of the water. It really made me realize how all the parts of F1 Race Stars work against each other, making it an incredibly unfluid and irritating experience. I'm not sure if on top of everything else that the tracks or poorly designed, or if it's just the terrible gameplay and uncontrollable cars that make it feel that way. In the end, I could only recommend this game if you already know you want it. If not for the ridiculous collision effects, this game would still be passable. Truly one of the worst mechanics I've had to struggle against in any racing game.			",461,188,41,76,83,11,95

												This game is terrible and amazing at the same time.  Think Mario Kart, but with mostly real people, on tracks inspired by real race tracks and you've got an inkling of what this game is like.  There are, of course, some of the same basic power ups that will help you or hurt your opponents.  Characters do all sorts of silly things, especially when you win a series.  You can customize a little bit of your car.  Really, it's a wonderful game, but for some reason it makes you think it's terrible while you're having so much fun.  I just can't explain it.

												FYI! For some reason this game is much cheaper on Origin, and if you buy it through Origin it still gets added to your steam account.It's a very fun and light hearted game. If you are looking for a mario kart type game for PC, this is one of the better options.  Unfortunately online multiplayer is desolate. I haven't seen a single player online since I got the game. However the 4 player split screen is very fun (you need xbox 360 controllers for that). One negative for me is that the graphics and control settings are pretty much non existan. It's pretty clear that they want you to be using an xbox 360 controller for this game.			",62,1,3,2,6,0,3

												This game is great, I was looking for a fun Mario Kart clone and there was nothing, until i found this!  It is colourful, stylishly presented with slick cartoon visuals and great audio and has a great attitude to the source material making the whole atmosphere fun and lively.Multiplayer online is a little sparse, apparently it was priced a bit too high on release, but its work every penny in a steam sale and has teriffic 2 player split screen!Gameplay is challenging but fun and the powerups are as frustrating to get caught with as they are when you use them to win races, there are 3 engine sizes allowing for greater speeds and the maps are teriffic caricatures of the host track/country.I love this game and i defy you not to.

												F1 Race Stars is a great option if you want that 4 player mario kart feel without having to buy a nintendo system or resort to an emulator. This game also allows for 4 player co-op through the career, which I think is a nice touch. The controls are tight while still arcadey, the tracks are fun with nice visuals, and the music is peppy and exciting. This game is certainly a fun little romp. -PR0XIDIAN			",912,138,59,85,56,7,110

												I know it's a karting game and luck does play a little into them, still, decent karting games still reward skill.  This game, THIS  GAME is nothing more than a test of patience.  It's pure luck, nothing else, doesn't matter how well you drive.  You will be on the last lap on the last straight and someone will get a warp into the front.... This happens all the time, it's not just an odd ""oh well, you lucky B............."" It's almost every race.It's a great shame tbh becuase the game plays really well, it's very playable, it's smooth, the variations of the real tracks are done well but for me that element of luck is far far far to high to make this game enjoyable in any sense.

												I would only reccomend to buy this game on sale. That is somewhat pushing it as well.Let me say the game does have it's fun moments when you're playing with some friends, but it also has a lot of bad.One of those being the damage system, your car physically gets crippled (slowed down and hard cornering) when you're attacked with power ups. This means you have to run through a pit lane to repair your car almost every 30 seconds or so. The power ups in the game are also quite dull, not really much exciting going on with them to me!The game has a lot of issues, AI is extemely buggy, sometimes they're like having a speed hack - no idea what that is about, and with the damage issues it can be a stuggle getting into the top 3 a lot of the time vs AI - not to say it's not a challange but it's due to you being damaged most of the time.There is an option to disable the damage but I haven't found one yet for championship mode when you have more than one local player. I don't mind it, it's sort of one of those things you love to hate. Just buy it cheap, I don't think it's worth a big number either way.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's Mario Kart but with an F1 twist!...is what I want to say, but Mario Kart is fun. The powerups are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, the damage feature is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t (get repaired, instantly take damage and have to do another lap at half speed), and there's such a limited number of tracks that it feels like they didn't even try with this game.If nothing else, it speaks volumes about this game that Codemasters have to continually give it away free as a prepurchase bonus for their newer games. They can't get anyone to buy it so maybe they can convince someone to buy the DLC by giving them the game.Just avoid this game. It's terrible. It's NOT a game you really want to be playing. Especially since almost two years after initial release it's still £14.99. There's barely £5.99 of content in this game, let alone £14.99!			",71,8,7,7,7,0,3

												The closest to Mario Kart for the PC you can find. Great for LAN parties.A couple issues:- Inability to edit controls. You get what you get. Using Xbox 360 controller works well, though.- When alt-tabbing back from the desktop, it will go from fullscreen to windowed and not return until you reconfigure your video to windowed and then back to full screen.

 Flawed but still Fun Don't be put off by the cheesy, cartoony graphics and outrageous exaggerations of the gameplay. If you are a Formula 1 who liked Mario Kart at any point in your life, this a great game to get during a Steam sale. Sure, the items are frustratingly rigged and the whole game's full of gimmicks, it's still great fun, especially since you can race as caricatures of your favorite real-life drivers and even some  slight  exaggerations of real racecourses (from 2012, at least). Do note this is NOT a game to treat as a simulation in the same way that Codemaster's flagship Formula 1 games should be seen as. This is simply old-fashioned, item-throwing, boost-abusing, absolutely almost chaotic random fun you'd expect from any arcade racing game. And it excels at that, though the Multiplayer feature is a bust, unfortunately.In terms of DLC, the addon tracks are great fun, and ignore the accessories. They're borderline useless and a waste of money. Other than that, you've got yourself a pretty solid arcade game to kill some hours. And you'll have plenty of fun, if your expectations aren't built around the Formula 1 simulators.			",62,10,32,0,1,0,1

SO you shouls be able to play this on nearly any computer as long as your hardware is compatible.BE sure to check it out, remember there is also a demo so you can try before you buy.

												This is a kart racer with no soul and zero charm.  The AI is some of the worst I have ever seen in terms of rubber-banding.  It is also exceedingly frustrating that the AI will ram into each other, the player, and course items and take absolutely no damage whereas they can pretty much total the player's kart from the very start of the race and seemingly at will any time during its duration.  Bottom line:  Stay away from this kart racer unless you are a masochist, or want to give a gift to a person you hate.			",551,152,19,100,57,8,103

												In the world of ""WACKY-RACIN'-GAMES!!!"" F1 Race Stars stands alone in being...exactly like all of the others. That's not a bad thing - this is quite enjoyable, and I like Codemasters. The game is fun, it's wacky, there's tons of DLC's that add new things, and two years after the release I buy it in a bundle. For the price? It's excellent! It's well balanced, not buggy, doesn't crash on me, and it's playable with a keyboard or a controller. There's a ton of content to unlock, lots of achievements, etc. You know, all those fake psychological bonuses you get for playing a game. So, if you think that Sonic All Stars Racing is getting boring, or you're tired of any of the other SUPER WACKY RACIN' GAMES, you might want to give this a try. Definitely not bad, especially if you can get it on a huge discount with all the DLC, but it isn't worth dropping double digit bills on. Fun factor is huge, music is lame, characters are bobbleheads - all the gimmicks are there! Fun, polished, and I think that's the whole point. I do think they went a little bit crazy with the DLC, though. 6.5/10 - You'll get your money's worth if it's on sale, but it's not the greatest game of all time.			",2906,1132,96,353,353,29,474

												There is not much to say about this game, its an average cart racer and thats all, the only thing that sets this game apart from other carters are the good graphics and fluid gameplay. There are alot of flaws in this game, first off there is NO drift, every cart racer needs a drift no matter what, i found myself crahing into a wall and getting stuck constantly. The second thing are the powerups, when i wasnt getting stuck i was getting hit with bubbles, bubbles everywhere. Third is the lack of fun things to do, it was very repetive and made me sleepy after an hour or two. This should DEFINETLY NOT  be $39.99, the most it should be is 5.00 - 10.00 dollars at MOST, luckily i got it free by pre-ordering F1 2013, which i HIGHLY recommend! If you are anywhere from the ages of 8-13 and enjoy carting games i suggest this game but only if you want one off steam. Mario Kart For Life!			",134,15,3,10,6,1,12

												Mario Kart Clone?Alright, i bought it and wanted a Mario Kart for PC... This is what I got:21/25 Gameplay14/15 Replayability5/10 Fairness6/10 Controls9/10 Graphics8/10 Sound8/20 Multiplayer-----------------------------71/100And here we go:In F1 Race Stars you get a game similar to Mario Kart. Same Power-Ups, same Gameplay. There is not much to say about these two points. But why does it just have 5 points in Fairness?The Damage System! If you get hit, you get damaged, if you get damaged twice you are half as fast as the others. And that until you reach the next Repair Boxes. And to drive into these you loose even MORE time! Unfortunately you can only turn off the Damage playing with friends. This leads to the next point: Multiplayer. There is no working multiplayer in this game! Noone plays it, becuase the Match Making is bugged...But if your friends play it, you get a nice experience: you can choose everything- Damage, Power Ups, Special Things, Length... And then the game makes very very much fun!Unfortunately this game had no racing wheel support. Just controller support. But a good thing to say about it is that the Controls are pretty easy (WASD+Shift+Space+Alt) and that you can play this game in Co-Op mode with a splitscreen and on 1 computer. But you have to have a controller for each person you wanna play together with, just one person can use the keyboard.Because of the easy Controls, the Replayability is very good. Also this game has very many game modes, a campain with several cups on several roads and a quick race mode. I took away 1 point because of the eventual Rage Quits because of the (Un)Fairness.The Graphic is pretty good, the maps look cool and the special effects are well detailed. Everything is in a pretty comic style and there is no violent. You can play it with your whole family (if you turn off the damage...I am already hearing your kids cry...) and your friends. The only thing I have to fault is the sometimes angular graphics. The sound is nice, too, but it had a bit potential upwards.TL; DRThis game is a Mario Kart for PC with an unfair Single Player Damage and no Online Community. Play with your friends or Offline and have fun! (See my Sonic all Star Racing Transformed Review which has 87/100 points before you buy!!)			",105,18,13,15,9,1,21

												Avoid this trash.The game might look nice and have a F1 license but it is infuriating to play. It is super unfair and unbalanced. It really doesn't matter how good you are in racing games, only luck matters in this game. If you get a teleport, congrats you pretty much won the race.However if you actually try to race properly and stay first for the most part of the race, there's 99% chance you will get hit by 3 homing missles in a row. And then someone will teleport in front of you. Also the driving itself isnt very good anyway. Enemies can take corners way faster than you. THERE'S ALSO NO MODE WITHOUT POWER UPS! The game would be way more enjoyable if you could turn them off and just race. But for some reason you can't.Theres no progression system whatsoever, you can only earn trophies but not improve your vehicle/driver in any way. Secret passages are also quite bad, as only one person per lap can use it, making it pretty much useless. Also the things that let you use the passages don't spawn every lap for some reason?You also always start the race from last position, waaay further in the back than anyone else.Overall pretty trashy game, if you want arcadish game in F1 style get Mini Drivers. It's cheaper, has way better balance and is generally more fun in general. It certainly isn't perfect but it's better than this mess.			",173,10,18,5,17,1,33

												Alright, so I'm pretty torn on this. I'd been waiting a long while, debating a long while on whether I wanted to get my hands on it, because it looked quite fun and silly and right up my alley, and it's from Codemasters, but the reviewers I normally trust noted frustrating difficulty with it. Having finally picked it up for a little under $4 USD, I think I can sum up all the problems with this game in one word: ""Arbitrary.""There's an arbitrary elimination mode that's horribly unbalanced and basically just means the person in first at the beginning wins. There's an arbitrary shortcut system that requires you to find a key on the track and drive through a specific gate to basically win right off the bat. There's an arbitrary random interval of time between the ""3, 2, 1"" and the ""Go"" to make boosting at the start that much harder (though honestly I found that kinda funny). There's an arbitrary damage system that slows your car down after each item that hits you, which serves only to force you to pit and to let those in the lead keep their lead. The whole freaking point of item racing is to keep it competitive, make it so that it's a constant fight for position based on skill. The gameplay mechanics routinely defeat their own purpose here. Hell, there's an item that  instantly teleports the user to lead position. How ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lazy is that, destroying the entire purpose? In a great deal of the career mode's races, I didn't feel any satisfaction whether I won or lost, feeling instead like I just ended up wherever the game decided.Now, if you've read all of that and still want to give this game a try due to curiosity, sale price, a love of F1, or being charmed by the trailers, then I can recommend this to you. If you want a better racing game, you're spoiled for choice here, but Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed is name-dropped so often for a reason. If you just want to check this in particular out on sale, then go ahead; you'll definitely get your $4 worth.The course design is a major, major plus here. I'm not too familiar with F1, but I know a lot of the real tracks from other racing series, and especially racing games (and especially games by Codemasters, at that!). The KERS system encourages taking your time in sharp corners, meaning that places like Monaco and the mountain roads of Japan (because come on, it's a Japan course in a racing game) get to be twisty and winding without ruining momentum. Each course is a loving, cartoonish, theme park version of its setting, be it the country entirely or just the city, and national stereotypes are played for humor, creativity, and really exciting scenes. Racing on bullet trains in Japan, leaping through the castles of Germany, and battling in the factories of the UK are grand fun. As an American, I personally found the USA course to be absolutely adorable, and love the effort they put into these. The original courses are part of the design, of course, and it's quite impressive to see familiar sweeping curves recreated in the country's landscape. I will also have to give some points for sheer awesome value of Abu Dhabi starting with a back-to-back combo of Yas Marina and Ferrari World.The character design is your usual exaggerated cartoony look, but the animation sells it. Seeing your driver put on their helmet a random way every single time you start the race livens up the usual countdown, much like the Battlefield games having those one-in-ten-thousand reload animations. I don't know the drivers all too well, but was able to find pretty much all of the ones I've heard of. The voice acting is serviceable, and playing mostly as Kimi Räikkönen, it took a while before I realized that every driver speaks their own home language with a peppering of English. It does add a good deal to the experience to hear an international field, even if a bit exaggerated in performance.There is a massive amount of bloat in this game, from extraneous unfun game modes to a wealth of gameplay mechanics that are never, ever explained. The key and shortcut system is never once mentioned. Boosting at the start by pressing the pedal right at ""Go"" is never mentioned. Boosting after a jump by hitting the gas the second you land is never mentioned. And so on, and so forth. You're gonna probably need a guide for this one.The sense of speed honestly isn't too impressive outside of boosts. It doesn't really feel particularly like F1. It's the courses and the KERS system that really hammer home what it's based off of. All in all, it's absolutely goofy in a great way, but I mostly only recommend it to those out there that, say, would go into a game store and pick out a racing game from the bargain bin just to see what the experience is like, not for completionist's sake or out of serious hope it'll be a major timesink and investment. For the most part, I really was tempted to hit that ""Not Recommended"" button. But I haven't stopped playing, so I think that answers that.EDIT (3/10/17): Having put this game down and not ever really picked it up again, only doing so briefly before uninstalling it quickly again in frustration, it just feels wrong of me to leave a positive review up. The game's charm does NOT make up for the horrific imbalance, lazy mode design, and cheap, overpowered shortcut system. It's this sort of coasting by on ""good enough"" that's left us with a dearth of actually decent racing titles; don't encourage this.			",202,57,48,14,17,5,10

												I enjoy this game.  I do wish the controls were customizeable and I wish that a wheel could be used, but for the price I paid for it, it's well worth it.  Wonderful little time waster and you can't beat getting an opportunity to race with ""Cartoon Schumacher"".  That's worth the price alone			",114,20,56,12,19,4,8

												F1 race starts is a arcade racing game that is similar to mario kart.  The racers are real f1 race stars, and the items have been changed to fit the game.  Unlike mario kart this is not a very good racing game.	Personally I've played almost all of the mario kart games, so this game was not very hard in the slightest for me.  The reason it's so easy is that fact that you have no “rival” racers.  In Mario Kart, you usually have a few characters that get 2nd or 3rd place as you get first and keep really close to you in points for the standings.  In this game I would be able to finish 5th and 6th at times and still win because some other person with no points would win the race and I'd still be in first.	There are not that many different tracks and you will go over the same tracks over and over again in different cups.  There are 30 cups, which vary in the amount of tracks they have.  At first they are just slandered races but eventually the other cups apply a variety of challenges  instead.  Sometimes you have to stay in first to get points, other times you have to collect cups on the road to add to points.  Each track also has a shortcut system that I personally never used, but if you are having troubles I'd recommend looking their locations up you can win races just by using them.	The racers are not really exciting, and the attributes each pair of racers have didn't alter my experience.  The power ups are balloons, and other real world things that aren't creative, like a torpedo, a ghost boost that makes you invulnerable and move quickly.  One of the most awful idea's the game put in is this stupid pit system.  If you get hit by a balloon or something, your car is damaged and moves slowly, and you have to go out of your way and lose placing to drive through the pit stop.  Really stupid idea in an arcade racer.	One more thing to say about the difficulty there are 2 cups that are an insane spike in difficulty. In these they have the damage set to extremely high so if another racer even touches you you have to go pit and they all pass you.  It took me 3 hours to do the first and 3 to do the second.  They are quite random and will aggravate you so much you might just quit the game. 	I bought this game for about 5$, it has a few dlc's that are for multi-player which doesn't exist.  This is not a very good game unless you are a diehard mario kart fan.  Even then go play that instead.			",274,43,11,45,13,1,33

												Like most people I got this free, so Codemasters can give it away. If I’d paid for this then I’d be googling Steam refunds right now. This is a F1 themed karting game similar to Mario kart but without the fun, graphics, cool weapons or basically anything that would make you wanna play it. This really is terrible. The commentary sounds like they got random people from the Codemasters office to step in to save a few pounds. After half a lap even the most enthusiastic player will be thinking, “Codemasters what is the f**king point”. I’d rather spend all day biting the toe nails of a tramp than load this game again.

												Whether you play at 1000c or 3000c, the difficulty doesn't change much. As a result, it is an incredibly frustrating game which doesn't reward you in any way regardless of how well you play. The entire game depends on luck and only luck for you to win a race and the eventual championship. It's well made, but that's about it.			",80,6,2,8,1,0,3
