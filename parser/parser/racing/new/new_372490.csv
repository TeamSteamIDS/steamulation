												Im getting a refund. What I hoped for was a Marble Blast revival. Instead what I got was a nonsense physics system and randomized levels thus making the want to compete for fastest times die. Why have a game where level completition speed is the focus yet make the levels random AND not have the a quick restart button mapped?Furthermore, the UI is bad and the game does bugger all to actually tell you what the ♥♥♥♥ you're doing. It took me a couple of attempts to figure out that I wasn't supposed to be going after the gems, but instead the black spirits or whatever the ♥♥♥♥.Dissapointment.			",465,91,16,48,34,5,43

												I was hoping for Marble Blast ""the metal edition"". It was metal, that I give credit for.Judge for yourself in my Let's Play (5 parts in German):

			Groovy. Erste Rollversuche als Kugel im Level A-1. Ich erinnere mich zurück an Marble Blast. Rumrüpfen und schwarze Materie sammeln. Der erste Timeout.		


Unfortunately, the game itself is too random, has obvious bugs like ramps not being loaded, making levels impossible, has almost no explanations and too many instant death traps. I could not get past Level A-5 which is a pity as the survival mode only gets unlocked after A-8 which I was looking forward to. I could not get enough stars to even buy one single item. (As a matter of fact I barely managed to find the shop screen at all after I already lost hope and desperately tried to find settings or key bindings which I might have overlooked) The graphics are appealing, though they are not refined enough to qualify the view as a pleasure. The menus are not user friendly.Please fix the randomness. Make sure, all blocks and ramps are loaded and the camera does not reset itself. Add some explanations or make the tutorial levels clear enough to learn what is needed to play. Maybe make the map rotating instead of always facing north. Ditch the timer running out. Make it beatable. I could be a nice game, but at the current version 1.0.0, it is just not ready.			",12,5,0,0,2,0,0

												Groovy-------------------------------------------------------------------------Groovy is a Marble Maze game that is similar to that of the old NES Classic Marble Madness, Which I was very fond of growing up.The main Difference is this is that game on steroids, Much more things to do, much more mechanics.The Music is ok, its very soft and slow, Then picks up at times, But over all i'd label it closer to futuristic lounge music.The mousefeedback, even when setting the sensitivity to high seemed off and sort of laggy in movement, at least in the menus, It doesn't seem to be this way when actually playing, but moving the mouse through the menus seemed laggy like it dragged to much.. I like the interface and menus, But that mouse lag on the menus is pretty bad.Honestly the game needs one of the forced tutorials, if only for a minute, to at least tell what those things are your getting, and show controls. Once I figured them out, The controls of this game were actually a hell of a lot smoother than marble madness, and I actually had fun flashing back to classic marble platforming.I do with the levels had a little more color to them, as everything is a little bland and all looks similar.The 3d environment itself is really nice besides the lack of vibrant coloring.Not sure what happened on the 2nd level, But I Appear to have glitched inside of a spaceship? No way to pause or exit out of it? Had to quit, Must of been a glitch of some sort, Because when I went back and loaded it again, It beamed me from the ship down like it was supposed to.Even tho its been used in many games, I like the 3 star system here, It works at rating you pretty well. Overall if you like Marble Madness, you'll probably dig this at least to some extent.I do wish it had sort of a story behind it tho, idk I know its just a marble so its hard, but imagine the marble was a creature rolled in a ball, or a computer with a mind? Just food for thought, makes the ""Character"" a lot more relatable.Pros:+ Its Like Marble Madness+ Way Better Mechanics than Marble Madness+ Well Designed + Fun Gameplay+ Achievements + Trading Cards Cons:- Menu lag- Glitched on 2nd level on my first play, so Probably not all the bugs are out.- Not very Colorful- Lack of storyThis review is a part of Steamified's Community Reviews program and the credit goes to Steamified for providing the key for review purposes.For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.

												Well, groovy is a unique challenging game, which is way harder than i first thought.I wonder to see multiplayer in this game somehow, to challenge not with a timer, but with other players as well.And I will still recommend it, because i have never played a platformer similar to this and i have got some positive feelings after playing.

												GROOVY is a rather bad ball rolling game.The physics are poorly implemented, the controls are not great, the soundtrack is annoying and the UI is a mess. The procedurally generated levels are not particularly interesting either. And finally, while it doesn't look terrible it's certainly the least visually impressive Unreal Engine 4 title I have played.I only played through a few levels before giving up. GROOVY is really not worth your time as there are lots of much better ball rolling games available. Not recommended.The good:- Nothing reallyThe bad:- Bad controls- Poorly implemented physics- Uninteresting levels- Annoying soundtrackThe ugly:- No 16:10 resolution support			",558,228,11,89,48,8,102
