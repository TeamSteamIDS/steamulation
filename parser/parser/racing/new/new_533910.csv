Early Access Review
								Is this a joke?  This has got to be a joke, right?Take one look at the screenshots in the ""community"" section, and you'll see what I mean.  The in-game graphics look like something from the very early days of 3D- nothing like the screenshots on the store page.  The controls lag about half a second behind when you press the keys, which would make it unplayable even if it weren't VR- in VR, it's legitimately nausea-inducing.  The map is large enough that you can drive in one direction for about 30 seconds before falling off... and I mean in the ""there is no invisible wall and you will plummet forever"" sense.Stay away from this garbage.  ""Big Rigs: Offroad Racing"" offers more fun than this.			",457,247,19,57,66,9,82

												I brought this as i enjoy driving sims, i own a logitech g27 and the HTC Vive so i enjoy mashing the two togethet for example, project cars. After getting a E-mail regarding this game i was interested in seeing what it would be like to play so i decided to purchase the game as its rather cheap and didn't do much research. I was very let down and shocked by how badly the images and video are not what the real game is!I load into the game, im then placed on top of the vehicle (Not the cockpit) with no option to swap only a menu saying press H to hide the Menu...and shocked by the graphics...nothing like the images at all. I simply ignore the graphics, thinking along the lines of ""it's early access, the images are probably what they are going to aim for"" and i then proceed to figure out that i am now sitting down in a really awkward angle trying to steer this vehical using the WASD keys as my wheel pedals do not work for the game and the wheel was hard to use (Sitting in very weird angle).5 minutes later i hit the edge of the map, fall off and keep falling. Simply quite a joke at how bad the map was.I quit the game, put in for a refund. Got Accepted.Do not buy this game, it is highly misleading with the images and video's provided also the current reviews seem faked by the team who made the game or friends of the developer.

			** UPDATE: I HAVE BEEN INFORMED RUSSIAN UNDERGROUND VR UNITY ASSET CAN BE FOUND HERE: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/19901 ** BCInteractive is the Dev/Publishing “Team” that is...		

Offroad VR is an asset flip of the Unity Store package “Offroad Pickup + Animated Hands” by Torvald-mgt. BCInteractive or “Berdyev” has made a habit of deleting comments, deleting threads, vote botting, fake users, fake reviews, and removal of review code given to other critics when he didn’t like what they had to say. In addition to that, this mimeograph artist has harangued consumers, telling them to kill themselves and referring to them as children whenever someone had something negative to say about his asset flips.I urge you not to purchase this ripoff artist’s cavalcade of crap as all you are doing is supporting a toxic individual who does not deserve your money or your time and who attempts to profit at your expense without introducing any of his own content. He has done this on a dozen titles on Steam and has made insane amounts of money already.The original Unity package can be found here: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/39396 ",169,78,2,44,23,2,29

												Not happy just bought the game and it's not as advertised... Screenshots are not like actual game play... To the devs if you change your platform update screenshots to match. This feels like false advertisement			",33,16,2,0,4,0,0

												I can't believe that this... I'm lost for a word to describe this... program is even for sale on Steam. I got it cheap and it'd be expensive at half that price. What a load of utter garbage. I played this lame excuse for a driving game in VR mode and you inexplicably float above the car... no dash view. You know how you can play Spintires for ages, despite there not being much to do? I had to leave this on the menu screen just to have ""played it"" long enough to write this review. If this isn't a joke then it's outright theft. Buyer beware.			",785,162,46,80,78,6,84

												I think this is either a joke or a con, the video and screenshots above are either someone elses game or there's been a major f#ck up with development as the game in its current state looks like a 3 year old made it.... Someone gifted me this game, and that someone didnt pay for it thank god. What a sh#t sandwhich			",69,7,1,5,5,1,1

Early Access Review
								These off-road! on the VR management more difficult than on the steering wheel, and so it is quite interesting to drive a car. You can also control the keyboard. Good graphics, music tolerant. The game is in the early access, this will be something new and interesting.			",755,240,25,53,73,8,77

								Let me tell you something...This game offers you an offroad experience in VR. Which is one of the first (or even the first as is) games on Steam that is set to be an offroad game. Yes, it is in its early stages of development, but hey, they're working on it - and for VR - this is amazing. I only had about 20 minutes into the game, sort of enjoyed it and could really tell you - the future of this game is great.Should you buy it though? Well, its all up to you. If you mainly want to support the project and give a credit for its development AND try out alpha builds beforehand, before its official non alpha release - DO SO!Just my two cents. Hopefully environment will be changed/fixed due to low poly models/textures.			",9,0,1,0,2,0,0
