												Worst developer on steam. Never finish a title. Ban you from making comments about them and their lake of skill coding. This game like all their games so far is unplayable and is finished in their eyes. Made me feel like I've been mugged. It's just stupid how crappy this game is.This is my only negative review on steam. This will be removed so they can continue to sell this title. That is so wrong and I find myself disappointed with valve for allowing it! I can only assume that now that steam allows refunds this company will disappear very quickly. 30 odd hours and I never made it around the track once. There was no point as I could never make the controls work well enough to play.http://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Ghost%20Machine ",134,8,15,2,14,4,2

Early Access Review
								Worst driving game of all time?  I'm not sure about that, but it's definitely a contender.  I have never driven cars that handle like they do in this game.  Something is horribly horribly wrong with the physics in this world.  The AI is the only reason to like the game.  It's so entertaining!  The cars just flip and slide everywhere.  Sometimes they will be driving straight ahead and just randomly fly up into the air doing flips.These details plus the rest of the game content is not impressive, they basically need to redo the entire UI, all the game modes, everything.  Just start over. Since it's early access I look forward to updates, and every time I see a patch roll out I'll check back to see the progress, and update here if I see any glimmer of hope.

												Wow... Where do i begin? I know this is not an AAA game, so i didn't expect anything. But they really did no effort to try harder i guess...The game doesn't have licensed cars, i'm ok with that. You can identify the cars as real models in real life nonetheless. I started the first race selecting a Nissan Silvia, when the race loaded the car that i was driving was a R34 Skyline. And of course, i was ""WTF?"". I was in 1st place when in the last lap the counter changed (with no car passing me) and i suddenly became 11th. And again, WTF!Ok, i loaded the second game selecting an M series BMW. The race started fine. When i crashed the first time the car started... i don't know how to describe... literally break dance in the track. (See my screenshots). Then it didn't stopped, it fell off the ground in the map miasma, then respawned, started break dancing again, started to fly around the track and so on. This lasted for three minutes i guess. Then it fell off the map again and respawned in the start line.So... If you want a few laughs, this is the game. If you want something similar and less buggy try SHOFER Race Driver. It's way better than this game. I don't see any mark in this game saying ""Early Access"" so i suppose this is the final version, so no thanks.			",1468,420,125,86,261,21,172

												The game is buggy. I did 7 laps, but it was still lap 1 of 3. I overtook 8 cars, but I was still in position 9 (where I started)I flipped the car totally 5 feet in the air and was able to carry on trying. AI drivers were crashing and driving off the track. Most of the time I had a flashing message stating ""Wrong Way"" even though I was following AI drivers around the track..... ",1495,620,61,124,169,17,211

												Holy ♥♥♥♥, this is an awful game. They abandoned it while on early access. -The UI is awful. Even though this is a PC game, it doesn't support keyboad and mouse, but a controller instead. I'm startng to think that it was a console peasant who used some online tutorial to make this. -The engine sounds gave me ear cancer.  -The ""driving mechanics"" are ♥♥♥♥.  -The overall audio is ♥♥♥♥. -Dem physics though..They probably used some free assets they found online.Don't try making something that is beyond you.

Early Access Review
								2/10Bought it to use with the Oculus DK2.The ONLY thing it has going for it, is the fact that it uses the Oculus.The cars handle HORRIBLY, a F1 racecar has more play in its suspension then my 1990 talon. SUPER sloppy handling, either the developers didn't give a crap, or they have never driven in a car.The maps are bland and uninteresting, I played 3 races.. all of them on a circle track. (might have been the same track now that I think about it)The graphics are crap, looks like a racing sim from the early 2000'sit crashes alot when you try and work the menu.So yeah, if I had to do it over again, I'd spend my $20.00 elsewhere.

MtorSport RevolutionI had so much hope that this game will be very interesting title however I was wrong. After seeing the pictures you can see that the game looks nicely but its a just pictures. The graphics are very poor and badly optimized. Vehicles do not have lights and control is pathetic and it looks like we were traveling cardboard box with the wheels on ice. Besides cars are not equipped with hand brakes. In short, the game looks like a free app on the phone. Cars do not have the original names however look the same as those in the real (Renault, BMW, Nissan and more) but they look too badly. The cameras are strange but the worst looks from the inside because everything is square and not expressive. The game has a lot of bugs and once I managed to get out of the map (exactly the five times I on success). I don't want to describe this game with bad side but this game does not have any good side. Wants to add at the end of it is not worth the price since early access has ended and I have no idea if this will improve the game but if they will work further to improve the gameplay maybe im gonna to change muy opinion but now my rating is 1/10.

												Oh boy, where does one start!  MS Revolution will go down as one of the most unremarkable and forgettable titles around.  It felt like going back in time to a playstation 1 game, the graphics are blotchy and outdated, even on the highest settings.  This game offers nothing that the title suggests, there is nothing revolutionary about MS R.  The game's weaknesses are all too evident:        - Laughable AI        - Stone Age Graphics        - Dull Engine Sounds        - Horrible Car PhysicsIf you truly are mad enough to still buy this broken and hideous game then at least do yourself a favour and research it on the net.  Look up all the videos you can and then decide whether you're still keen to invest in this game.  I decided to ignore the bad reviews  posted, now i'm $14 dollars down and left with a driving game that has been uninstalled.Don't pay attention to the amount of time spent on this game, i've spent far more than what is recorded.  I never play online, when a game downloads i disconnect from the internet to play all my games offline.  Please take the advice to research this title before jumping in to purchase,  it is a major step backwards that simply isn't worth investing in.			",122,16,33,7,9,0,0

Early Access Review
								Oculus support is very good once you have it set up. Not straight forward to set up as is expected with most DK2 games. I am happy to suppoprt this game and do not regret the purchace BUT...Logitech Driving Force GT support is currently flawed. The cars reverse on thier own when no pedals are pressed? The car handling will be improved in future updates I am sure but even in comparrison to much older games like LIVE FOR SPEED and even RACE 07. This is the reason I can not currently recommend this game. Thank you for supporting Oculus Rift!! Keep up the hard work and keep those updates coming I will change my review once the game breaking issue is sorted. I know that it stated supported wheels are Logitech g25/27... I get my G27 tomorrow so will re-review after I test again.Hope this helps			",377,83,29,22,29,3,14

												Judging by the screenshots, I was hoping this would be a good game.I was wrong. How this isn't in Early Access is beyond me. It needs a ton of work.Pros:• I won my first race.• I got this for free in a Steam Giveaway.• Xbox 360 Controller support.• The bugs are hilarious.Cons:• Graphics are horrendous (looks nothing like what's shown on the store page).• I win every race. The A.I. is quite frankly, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.• No sound apart from the car engine noise and menu clicks.• So many bugs.• The XP system is awful, making you repeat the same races over and over just to progress to another abysmal track.I really wanted to like this game, I'm just glad I didn't waste my money on it. Maybe if they decide to majorly fix MotorSport Revolution, I'll change my review.			",3514,1346,142,351,516,49,522

												My first race had my car dropped onto the track and rock around before the race started.When the race actually started, my car veered into the wall without me pressing any directional buttons.Simply put, the controls are clunky and become completely uncontrollable on some terrains, that is certainly some kind of ""Physics-based racing.""The maps are blands, the experience system is arbitrary, and the graphics are not very good. It isn't the worst racing game but it is certainly not fun. The Menus and HUD on the other hand are some of the worst I have seen, boring and generic but worst of all, the car HUDS get in the way of information such as Laps and Position.

												FIrst of all, the sound design was annoying, I didn't feel satisfied when racing at high speeds, instead I was just wishing my motor would shut the hell up.Second, the AI was horrible, they crashed a lot with themselves, and sometimes their cars would flip over nothing. That would probably be best part if the game was supposed to be comical, seeing all of the cars suddenly crashing and getting wrecked may produce a chuckle or two.Third, the game feels incomplete, what's a racing game without a tournament I ask? There are different car tiers you can unlock, ranging from the relatively cheap and slow cars to the most expensive, high performing, fast cars around, but there's no point to unlocking them, there's no drive, you unlock these tiers with experience points, not cash earned trough races and tournaments, and you unlock all the cars of a tier at once, so you don't even have to decide which cars to unlock/buy. There is no story mod and there is no upgrade system, all this game has going for it is the Oculus support.I would not recommend this game.			",160,35,8,24,14,1,30

												This game shows interesting with nice cars and special stages, but I believe that the price set does not reflect what may offer the game as a whole. Beyond the graphics do not often get my mind, I noticed some problems in view which resulted in improper inclusion of features such as the process of race and the pause menu. Another thing that caught my attention was the AI who fails to give a good side to the player, as the abnormality on handling in specific situations.			",644,151,22,58,32,6,73

								If you have a DK2 I would definitely recommend this game right now. It's still Early Access but it's already a lot of fun. Lots of different cars and tracks to play. The car feel is more on the arcade side but that's the way I like it.The developers have wisely chosen to keep the graphics a bit lower so the framerate stays high and it works fantastically. Oculus recommends staying above 75fps at all times and it always was. It was often at 150fps (660ti). This means it's extremely comfortable to play with the DK2.I can't wait to see how they continue to improve it and what the final game is like.			",189,51,5,8,18,6,6
