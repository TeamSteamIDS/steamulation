												Full disclosure: I bought this game at 96% off, for fifteen pence. And even at that price, I would not recommend buying this game.This game in a word? Unrealised. The actual game has two themes -- the first being a fairly generic 'your actions have moral consequences' theme that's used extremely simplistically by giving an occasional yes/no choice, and the second being age, which is dealt with only in an exceedingly shallow capacity. While both of these themes can be compelling when written sufficiently well, the more unique and interesting one is age; most people playing videogames are fairly young or approaching middle age, so age is a topic that gets swept under the rug or only dealt with as a way to get rid of a character in most games. Given a nuanced portrayal, it could have been excellent here. It wasn't.In terms of gameplay, it has the standard non-combat rpg maker formula -- wander around, talk to people, get information, solve puzzles. Most rpg maker games will attempt to flavour their world beyond the basic graphics by giving interesting flavour text on clickable items, a feature I adore. True, this game does have many clickable items, and a lot of flavour text... but all of it is either very bland descriptions of what you're looking at, or immature flavour text.Actually, let's cycle back to the immature bit. Do you think naked pixelated old men are funny? Do you think it's great that a good portion of your game world is compared to poo? Because that's why some of the steam pages related to this game ask for age confirmation, and the devs never seem to get tired of it. It's pretty much worthless in terms of content, both comedically and in terms of worldbuilding. It just makes the game seem like it was made by juvenile teenagers.The writing, outside of the themes it tries and fails to tackle, is uninspiring. NPCs are both unlikeable and boring, as, in fact, are all the player characters. There simply isn't enough dialogue given -- in a format, mind you, that really *needs* dialogue and description in order to be effective -- to characterise even one of the protagonists beyond a very simple pastiche of whatever their problem is. I feel like the dev(s?) of this game aren't really familiar with creating works of art or fiction -- although, as a plus, I only noticed one glaring grammar problem (an NPC using ""were"" when the correct version for the context would have been ""where."" There were moments of writing which, although not fantastic, was at least interesting (the nurse chapter, with the mindscrew hospital segment  was intriguing).Poor programming is also evident; two instances that I spotted were being able to drive directly into the wall of the Pub while in my car, and the game locking up if you gave a certain item to an NPC from below. Usually, giving the item triggers the npc to down one square out of your way, and there is no exception made for the player choosing to stand there. Even accepting that there may be technical limitations in coding npc behaviour, it would have been child's play to simply make the npc move back through the passage to a square the player couldn't occupy, or alter the map slightly to ensure the player couldn't stand below the npc but the npc could still move there.On top of that, there is a huge lack of content in this game. It can all be seen and discovered in an hour or two, with no real problem; after that, everything else is repetition and padding. Ultimately, it feels like somebody's first game in rpg maker -- ambitious themes, poor execution. And that's perfectly fine, but not if there's an asking price. If you want a combat-light rpg maker game with better writing, more entertaining characters, and don't mind nudity (which, to be fair, this game has as well), then go and download Embric of Wulfhammer's Castle. It's free, and a shining example of what rpg maker games can do when the effort's put in considering all the detail and jokes put into the world. If you're considering buying this as a way to support the developer/support other rpgmaker games being on steam, don't. This game also had a small kickstarter (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1604197967/greyfox); again, considering you'll find much, much better rpgmaker games out there for free, has already created more money than the product deserves.To improve this game, I would advise the devs to recruit somebody with some real writing experience to draw out the potential of the themes it tries to handle, and, moreover, consider whether this is really the medium the game needs in order to shine. Very little of the good points of this game would be lost if it were in a visual novel format, due to the flavour text in the environment being mostly not worthwhile, and it would give the game chance to focus on dialogues, characterisation and story while dropping the largely redundant fetch quest gameplay. I would also advise them to do a little market research and observe what the standards are for commercial games of this type. To clarify: I think there's potential here in the themes, and if I had just downloaded it as somebody's first rpg maker project, I would be considerably more enthusiastic about it. But Greyfox is not a good enough product to demand money for, and too basic to justify the kickstarter that was attached. With more experience, this game could have been a gem. As it is? Not worth it.			",145,63,3,45,12,0,5

“I am incapable of conceiving infinity, and yet I do not accept finity. I want this adventure that is the context of my life to go on without end.”  ― Simone de Beauvoir, La VieillesseGreyfox is a really short RPGMaker adventure game that tries to come as an empathy simulation with the touch of speculative supernatural motifs scattered on the side. Fair warning though: pledging catch phrases like ""a town with a sinister secret"" and ""uncover its mysteries"" that we encounter in the trailer are quite the misleading advertisement here. Whether there be any sinister secret or a mystery to uncover - or not, it sadly won't be in our heroine's power to reveal in this really, really short adventure. We are just invited for a brief experience and shooed away to carry on with our lives without much explanation.If we are to arrange a consistent outline of events; here we have a young, dumbly cheery heroine who gets bored of her daily rush in the big city and decides to move into the retirement community of Greyfox. She comes in, greeted by a townful of dull, bitter old people without an ounce of empathy left in them and struggles through some frustrating interactions. Tired by the end of her first day, the heroine is welcomed by a mysterious old lady in the local pub only, with a sarcastic yet intriguing proposition to make: What if you could live their lives and decide their fates? By the touch of this mysterious lady, our heroine is to live an ordinary day in the lives of four town inhabitants and decide their fates eventually.Let's blurt out the truth: as far as choice and consequence games go, Greyfox isn't one of the greatest, but that doesn't mean that its trash. The game feels mysterious and deep at first, but it unravels to become quite superficial in display, limited and fractured in dialogues; and sadly rushed in its endings. On the other hand, there is also some symbolic figures and attributions to other games in the genre here and there, that may bring a brief smile when encountered. There is quite a good amount of anecdotes scattered around the little town for you to discover, alongside some interesting characters.One primarily weak point of all display is the narrative. It is depressing, cyclical and limited in its perspective. There isn't much humor - or at least qualitative humor to lessen the burden of the subject, yet the gravity isn't concluded with a consistent argument either. The final conclusion presented by the mysterious lady about the concept of right and wrong felt a bit contradictory for my taste. Please do not go into this little adventure to come across a genuine miracle. You'll get what you pay for: a small story with one ambiguous point of view that will present you maybe something to think about. With better writing, this game could have been much, much more.Graphics are basic RPGMaker, without a notable soundtrack or any voice acting. Character designs are somewhat curious and interesting though. The first playthrough will take about an hour - one and a half at max - and the game has 3 different endings. Going for all will give you roughly 2 hours of gameplay. Oh, and it has achievements if that means anything to you. For its current price, I think its basically fair deal. If on sale; heck, why the hell not to support an indie developer struggling to create her first game?Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												Greyfox is a short and sweet little game made in RPG Maker, thugh I'd not call it an RPG since it really is more of a point and click adventure type of game.  The premise is really interestng as it is modern day.You play as a young girl looking to better her life.  She quits her job and moves to a town called Greyfox with no promise of a new job or even a place to live.  Then you meet a strange woman who tries to deter her from staying and she leads the main character through a set of dreams where she gets to live the lives of other people in the town.Good points:+Interesting premise+The four characters your main character gets to walk around as are interesting.+Lot of stuff to discover and people to talk to, obvious care was taken at constructing this little town.+Multiple endingsNeutral points:*Rather short, I was able to get all the achievements in less than two hoursNot so good points:-The main character really was lacking in any characterization-The characters whose lives you lived were in some cases very stereotypical elderly people even if they were interesting.Overall though, I'd recommend the game.  It's short and simple, but also not very pricey.  It's definitely a game to pick up and play and you can easily finish in one game session.  The premise is definitely unique and a refreshing change.			",245,462,0,130,43,2,51

												This game is bad. It's boring, cliched, and unpolished. It didn't connect with me enough to be depressing, and the promised mystery doesn't materialize. The plot starts with a deus ex machina, and ends with a moral unrelated to any of the preceding events.This game could have been interesting. It tries to deal with themes you rarely see in video games. But the potential is completely unrealized. I regret the pennies I spent on this game, but more than that I regret the time I wasted on it.I know it might be tempting to pick this up if you're an achievement hound, for the easy 100%. But don't do it. Have some self-respect.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

An ok short rpg worth some penniesPros:+ Cheap+ Worth the money+ Easy game to beat+ Has achievements and trading cardsNeutral Points:> Story is ok but lacking in crucial parts, such as the ending, which seemed rushedCons:- Short- No combat- Lacks depth overall- Dialogue is quite bad- Choices don't matter regardless of being made out they doDownload Size: 347mbTrading cards: 5 cards in the setAchievement difficulty: Easy to 100%Hours to 100%: 2-3Rating: 3/10Recommendation: If you have the spare change to waste it's okMy Opinion:Overall it is cheap and worth the small amount of money I spent on it because I got some trading cards and a easy 100% game. Other than that I didn't enjoy the game much due to the reasons above. If you are looking for a great RPG maker game then I'd keep looking, there are certainly better, but if you are looking for a easy to 100% game then this would be good for you.

												An RPG maker game that is set in the modern day.For once you're not an Elf warrior fighting dragons and wizards, but you're a normal human being in a normal world.Well, mostly normal.Greyfox is a short game, but the game does have you make multiple decisions which will lead to different endings so there is some replayability. It also has Steam achievements.It's definitely worth a play through or two.			",2533,1063,103,328,347,26,430

												At most, I think the game is okay.I can see what its goal was to do and for what it presents, it's okay as a whole. However, the dialogue can be groan-worthy at times and the story arc for each character is too short to actually be memorable or even to have anything more than the cliches. I was able to finish this game and got all the achievements in less than two hours. The game tries to present this ""depressing"" and ""mysterious"" story and present ""tough"" choices for the fate of each character, but looking at it as a whole, it doesn't exactly deliver the impact that it wants to give off.// Spoilers start here, I guess //""A town with a sinister secret"", ""Uncover its mysteries"".These are two phrases that appear in the trailer, but really, I personally felt misled. There's no secret or mystery about the town; You move to a little town from the city and you feel ready to retire when some woman with the power to implant you into other peoples' bodies wants you to see that you're still too young and you aren't really ready for death. She shows you the stories of those who are, and you have the choice of whether or not you think each character should die. There's no ""discovering the truth"" unless you're just learning about the characters' backgrounds, and even then, they're pretty flat and to the point.For a game that literally has the aspect of ""tough choices"" in its description, even the character you play as doesn't have a lot of feeling in either choice you made. She replies with short sentences that hardly show emotion, so why should the player have any emotion? Furthermore, when you can just skip to the end for some parts of an arc, it really puts all the other dialogue and event checks to waste, like in Kat's where all you have to do is get your medicine and talk to the Mysterious Woman.One thing that bugs me is that once you finish going through the characters' stories, she tells you how many people you chose to kill and tells you that she hopes you're ready to take on the guilt of your actions for the rest of your life, but she also tells you that she's not going to tell you what's ""right"" or ""wrong,"" which feels extremely contridictory to me. She brings you into these peoples' lives for you to judge them, and of course it's by your norm moral standards, so naturally you and the woman must have a sense of ""right"" and ""wrong"" when she talks about guilt for your murders (if you chose to do that), so what's her real angle here? That aspect of the story is just a nitpick for me, though.// Spoilers end here //Maybe I'm just more heartless than most people, but I don't really feel the impact of a depressing story like all the other positive reviewers do, because I don't feel for these characters. I do understand what the developer may have been trying to go for and it was a nice attempt. It could have been worse.As for the visual aspect, it's not anything terrible. They're decent; Using RPG Maker's base elements plus others' isn't something that should account into this game./// TL;DR: I think that Greyfox is alright for a start, but is definitely only worth the $0.19 paid for it. I hope the developer will continue to try and make more content that will have a more fleshed-out story.			",108,49,1,18,18,1,9

												I'm going to be honest here that I have been doubting about the final verdict of this game but overall all points generally point into the negative direction. The game has been made with RPG-maker and that is a part that I recognised. However the effort put into the game itself aside from the RPG-maker aspects are unclear to me since I'm not familiar with the program. Greyfox is a game about a girl, around between mid-twenties and thirties, who is sick with her job and wants to move to a town called Greyfox and live there. When she encounters someone peculiar in the bar she gets to play God and decide about the inhabitants of Greyfox who shall live another day and who must die. I think the town itself is pretty well structured but there is not a lot to do aside from the few 'side missions' you can do before the main story unveils. You can interact with almost every object in the game with some jokes here and there but most of them are cheesy jokes. Each part of the story opens up a different part of town which I wouldn't have minded if it had a particular reason.The main problem was to me that the story tried to pull me in and trying to let me empathise with the characters but it didn't happen even slightly. Everyone in that town is just either grumpy or close to silent there is no in between. I think the concept for the story was a good idea but the execution was off. If you enjoy an RPG that solely relies on his story and don't care about combat in an RPG you should consider this. Even if you like story driven games you should think twice before you buy. Otherwise this is a definite no buy to you.			",34,6,0,9,8,0,6
