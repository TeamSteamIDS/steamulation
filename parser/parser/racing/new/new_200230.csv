												Offroad drive is a real offroad game. it isnt traditional racing, it is time trials and u  can turn ghosts on to see opponents while playing. When i say real offroad game i mean you have to use winch and watch the pressure so you dont break cable, you can turn 4x4 on/off and lock in hubs to get diff types of traction when/where you need it. It also has  prettty nice mud and effects for vehicle interacting with it and making tracks and ruts and it affecting the physics of the vehicle. Mud washes off if you drive thru a clear water river or creek and can get muddy again.  Overall fun game but different and captures real offroading pretty dang well and its obvious the ydid their research on this game. Its a shame the market for it is kinda niche cause they did a good job on it.			",468,42,27,21,14,4,30

												Most offroad racing games have you racing around a relatively smooth dirt track that maybe has a few jumps. This game has some tracks like that, but where it really shines is when the smooth track ends at a huge pile of rocks and the only way forward is up and over.You have quite a bit of control over the vehicle with the ability to use lockers, adjust air pressure, switch between high and low gear ranges and a winch. Knowing how and when to use these systems is essential to finishing most of the tracks, thankfully a tutorial is provided. The graphics and climbing physics are impressive and there is a nice selection of vehicles, although a little more customization would be appreciated.This game has some fairly significant issues however. The driving model works quite well at low speeds (including simulating how easy it is to get stuck in deep mud) but breaks down at higher speeds on the smooth sections of the track where the vehicle has no sense of weight and slides and bounces around unrealistically. When you do get stuck without a nearby tree to use as a winch anchor, the lack of a reset button means you have to restart the race which can be extremely frustrating with the length of some of the events. The game does at least reset you if you roll the vehicle or fall off the track. In all the events you're racing a ghost ai which often feels cheaty when it effortlessly floats over a mud pit that you're stuck in up to your axles or hovers over broken rocks that hang you up at every turn. When it's not cheating it's not particularly smart and is relatively easy to beat.Unlike most offroad games, there is no free roam mode. The tracks are very detailed with lots of interesting obstacles, but you're confined to a relatively narrow corridor that resets you back on the track if you stray outside the boundaries. Sometimes these boundaries aren't very clear so you'll miss a turn and end up off the track with a time penalty. At least you have the option to set up an empty multiplayer server and drive around the tracks by yourself to better learn them and to test out the vehicles. I haven't found anyone else who has this game to test out multiplayer with so I can't comment on how well that works.For awhile this game appeared to have been abandoned with the devs being MIA but a recent update just a few days ago added additional language support so there is hope again that some of these issues will be fixed.Despite all these issues, I still had a lot of fun simply because there aren't many games that actually simulate low speed rock crawling and scrambling (besides possibly spintires which I'm waiting for a good sale on). I can hesitantly recommend this game as long as you can live with the issues and you can find it on sale, with the number of unresolved issues I wouldn't be able to recommend it at the full asking price.Pros:graphicstrack designrock crawlingCons:cheaty aipoor vehicle handing at speedno way to get unstuck without restarting raceno free roam7/10			",549,181,18,71,75,4,115

												This game is not for your average arcade racer fans. This is for people who know and understand what lockers are, what high and low 4wheel drive is for and what tire pressure effects when in the mudd or rock crawling. Off-roading is a blast and this game did a decent job capturing it. The only complaint I can think of is that it does not have a freeroam to explore an area and just create your own path through the map.For a off-road sim, this is a good one.

												ORD wants really badly to be an off road SIM-style game, but it just falls short in too many aspects. From a gameplay perspective, the game just overdoes the multiple obstacles and approaches and throws them all at you at once. Imagine being taught how to build a birdhouse in a tutorial then the first race asks you to build an entire apartment complex on your own. Even with 5 hours under my belt there were simply some courses I could not win.Now from a game design perspecive, ORD is almost an embarassment. The graphcis are... Okay at best. This would have looked good in the PS2 era of gaming. There are sometimes neat lighting effects and the draw distances are surprisingly detailed but everything else is left to be desired. Also the game cannot and will not remember your control configurations. So unless you want to use the up, down, left, right, arrow keys, you'll be remapping your control scheme every time you open it up.I'm willing to let all of that pass... but the one thing that really gets under my skin is the AI design. Basically if you don't win 2 out of the 3 courses in a circuit and place SECOND in the one you don't win... you will never come in first in a circuit. The same AI driver WINS... EVERY... SINGLE... TIME. There's no coming back from any finish less than 2nd place in any given race. That's just awful game design.Even if you absolutely LOVE anything offroading related, I cannot possibly recommend this game. It's just underdesigned on so many levels and in the few places that it does shine, it overly complicates things to the point where they are frustrating. Skip this game at all costs unless you are a fan of mental toture and self-harm.			",100,9,1,6,4,0,5

												5/10, this game is not worth the money, or the time. it is not ""true-to-life"" at all. 1C should get their Ish together and make a decent game or gtfo. How do you expect us to play an offroad game where you can not go offroading? All you can do is follow the racetrack, that's it. physics are crap, suspension is not realistic by any stretch of the imagination, the sounds of the engines are too similar. Looks like they rebooted one of their old offroad games with fancy graphics. that's the only good thing about the game...the graphics.My advice: go download rigs of rods (for free), if you want an offroading game where you can do some offroading.

That game is more than 10 years old, and it's still much more fun than this one.Off-Road drive does have some merits:-nice graphics (but nothing jaw-dropping)-all the standard off-road tools (differentials, winch...)- terrain deformationHowever, there are a lot of negative elements, which take away from the fun:- no free roam mode- limited gameplay modes- time penalty for ridiculously placed posts - so game feels like a 'keep on the track simulator'- no real carsI still play it occasionally, but only because there aren't that many other off-road sims.

												Tracks are pretty unique and the gameplay is pretty in depth compared to my few years of off-roading. Great detail with the terrain and the dirt and mud that gets on the trucks. Intersting challenges throughout all of the different locations from rocks and boulders to mud pits and swamps. The supsension can get a little over bouncy depending on the class of truck you use and the vehicles do drop power on some of the obstacles, but overall i think it's a fun game to just go mess around on			",54,1,6,2,4,0,19

												If you like off roading and rock crawling in 4lo and both axles locked this is a great game to kill the off-road bug when you can't get out there for real!  Adjust/change tire pressure, ride height, spring tension, tire size/tread, 4hi, 4lo, lock diffs. Choose the correct line and approach to get over obstacles.  If that don't work you got a winch too!

Worse still, it doesn't support force feedback. Not the one that makes your controller vibrates but the one that transmit surface, road-feel, grip level and such through your wheel, it doesn't have that.Anyway, if you want a good looking game but don't care much about controller support then it's a jolly fun game.Once again it doesn't support force-feedback.

												Excellant direction with this game allowing user to focus on driving skill instead of how fast u can drive and still control the vehicle.  If you like challenge rather then GO AS FAST AS YOU CAN then this is a great alternative game.  Just began playing but decided to give review already since nice to see this change of gameplay.  As of now I give it 8/10 and if I am able to connect a wheel for driving (nice you can already assign your own keyboard controls so dont have to use arrow keys) and variety of upgrades like better differntials, brakes, etc then I will increase rating.  GREAT GAME!			",57,8,8,4,38,1,36

												4/5 good game just a few issues with some bugs, wheels getting stuck in logs/rocks and some button mapping problems but apart from that this is a real good off road game. Challenging fast paced and fun, ranging from wading through rivers and swamps to rock climbing steep cliffs the game boasts pretty good physics, not a sim but a fun game non the less.

												I have nothing but good things to say about this game.  I come from a long history of off roading games.  The greatest offroad game I have come across was the Cabelas 4x4 Offroad series.  That was for the older, windows 98-XP system.  I have played several others such as Spin Tires (incomplete), and none have come close to the Cabelas series.  Then I saw this on youtube.  When I saw it come onto greenlight I was anxiouse for it to be green lit, and I was super happy when it went on sale.  I regret nothing of my purchase.  Ill give you a nice thorough pros/cons list of what I look for in offroadingMy list will definatly be disputable.PROSAMAZING physics.Truck mechanics (4x4, diffrentials, different tires etc) are the best I have ever seen.Ground deformation is only put where it is needed, thus reducing any lag and making the game easier to run.  The deformation that is there, is beautifulGreat truck selectionLevels are realistic to professional offroad raceing coursesSpecial tracks (mud bogs, rock climbs) test your skills of the extremesNice tutorial.  Gives you a good experience of what you're in for.Ghost truck and place indicator really add suspence, and give you a sense of competition to race against.  Some times the place indicator is innacurate, and when it says you're in 4th, you could win in 1st by a fraction of a second.CONS (most are very minor)Multiplayer and mods do not look promising to me at this point. Not much for soft body physics.  But really, it isnt needed and would just make the game more taxing.You cant add accessories to the truck (light racks, bully bars, roll cages etc.)Its only raceing - theres no checkpoint driving or free rome, but I have not found this to be much of a let down.  The racing ROCKS.Trucks do not have limited fuel.No ""super bogger"" trucks, or hard core mud bog/mud run tracks to use them on.Engine sounds arent the greatest in all trucks.In short, do I recomend this game?  Hell yes.  Solid 9/10.  Good job to everybody who worked on it, and thank you for making this beast game.EDITSince I wrote this review I have noticed that the public opinion has gone down.  If you ask me, people are picking on it to much and cant deal with a few problems from the big picture.  For $10, what did you expect?  Of course there are some problems.  One thing I saw was that there are to many obstacles.  Guess what?  Thats what pro offroading is about.  Obstacels, and lots of them. If the game is on sale, it is definatly worth it.  If you are trying to dicide between this and saving for a better game, I would save for a better game.  But, I still love it and recomend it.			",29,2,2,1,8,0,3

												Too many things to deal with for a controler, way to sensitive to drive with keyboard. If I want to play a 4x4 game in the mud & rock I dont want to take an hour or so trying to get a system working in order to play... it needed an Arcade mode, or buildup of controls. not being able to get thru the tutorial in 20 min is too much Simulater for this mudlover.Then again if you like to play with your axle a LOT...

												This is the MOST realistic off road driving simulator ever, from changing tire pressure, to the differentials on axles.  Being a driving game means you steer and are driving with some button, on top of that some options such as changing differentials or activating 4x4 drive, require holding a modifer button and an activation button.  Thats steering, driving, two buttons to change something, all at the same time.  This isnt off road driving, its Octopus driving.  This game is rated O for octopuses, Ha, never thought I would see that!!!  Rating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00			",2651,1115,101,266,362,29,398

												I bought Off Road Drive awhile back, and I can honestly say it's the closest to reality out of all other off roading games I've played. It's awesome, almost as fun as off roading for real. But, it's not without it's flaws. The first one I noticed is that despite it's description there is no snow courses in the entire game. Another is that for game modes you have a choice of career or.. career. While you can go back and replay courses, you can't choose the exact track you want to play on, rather you have to play an entire series of tracks. Oh and I should note that if you lose in the series while replaying it will override your previously clearing it and possibly make trucks you've unlocked unavailible. But the biggest flaw is that the game does not have a free roaming mode, and is abosultely humorless if you try and do anything other than drive on the course in the exact way it wants you to. I wouldn't have bothered with writing a review if I hadn't noticed that 1c just released a French translation a short while ago, which must mean the developers still care about the game on some level, and perhaps they'll listen to me. Please add a mode where the game doesnt force you back on to the track. Possibly add inverted courses to change it up a bit. And maybe add some snow tracks if the first two things end up being easy fixes. Don't let this game's potential go to waste! :)TL;DR Game is good if you get into real off roading, but don't expect to have as much freedom as you'd have in an older game like MotorM4x.

												Whoever decided to design this game has clearly never been to a wheelin\' competition. The times set by the computer are a little ridiculous. The vehilcles power are not even close to how they perform in real life. This game feels like they got pretty close to being perfect and called it quits. And why no sandbox mode or a least a practice option to where you can just slowly crawl your way through a track for fun. Even in the start up video there is a vehicle slowly crawling it\'s way through a course, but not once in this game will you be able to have that pace if you want to win. Would I recomend this game? Maybe if it was free, but it needs some more work, and it appears the only thing the developers are worried about it how many languages it has.			",10,2,6,0,7,0,2

												Great game. Love the graphics and choices of 4wd's. I really like the slow rock crawling maps. The suspention flexes around and the choice of bigger tires is great to. I would ask that you fix something in the settings, i change the left and right controls to A and D but every time i exit the game and reopen it, the settings arent saved. it never saves?? Its just annoying having to change the settings everytime i play it. I also wanna suggest that you ad a free roam, so that you can explore the maps at your will without a time constraint or points, just so you can have a bit of fun and get some screen shots and stuff.

												Thumbs DOWN! -editable review-I figured this game was mediocre at best but then simply viewed the trailer, y'know the one that mixes real video with game footage, and I thought to myself of how well made and of high quality that was made. Easily this game could be lost among the so many other off-road/racing/muthatruckers that have been released and fallen either into obscurity or electro-plated for every successive generation until it gets cancelled to let the latest driving/riding/racing/combat trend blaze it's own trail into the aforementioned obscurity. Is it simulation? I believe so but a simulation that is easily digestible, with corners cut realistically to - play. The vehicle roster is fanatsy based in reality, meaning the trucks are patterned off of real life counterparts only lacking the liscences to use their names. But the game is slow and hard to control, even without whatever is in place for native controller support amd multiplayer, the FPS drop on a consistent basis, and becomes so sluggish that it is a pain to drive. As far as tracks go, and they sometimes go far, and sometimes don't go anywhere fast due to rugged terrain, are based upon reality and there is no need to trademark dirt, mud and water. The mud will bog you down more than deep water. You will skid along twisting dirt roads deep in the jungle. Climb vertically over rock precipices. Scramble upon rocks jutting out from deeper waters. Each country has a plethora of tracks to race against the clock and other rider's time and are wating to be unlocked along with vehicles.Offroad Drive's gameplay can cater to the casual driver - meaning you can get through most tracks not using the tools at your disposal such as onboard tire pressure control, locking and unlocking differentials, 4 wheel drive etc. , allowing the player to enjoy the scenery and bumpy ride at the cost of finishing near the rear of the pack.For the enthusiast it is recomended to fasten your seat belts, because there is much challenge and learning of the tracks and modification for integration of utilization of skills per individual track, that only the most harcore could fathom gaining 1st place in every track with every vehicle. Basically this equals to much practice.+first person with head on a swivel+detailed graphics all around+simple as you would prefer+complex as you could imagine-performance overall is lacking-Controller support? what? where?-NO FREE ROAM (stay on or near track or be penalized and teleported  within 5 seconds)-Does multiplayer even work and what would be the purpose if it did, you only race against the clock and ghost truck-without good controls, whats the use of trying If you believe that this is a standard arcade racer - that is fine - it does have somewhat  flexible controls (use what you want, sometimes a hitch is necassary) but lacks true controller support. The detail is abundant in the environment such as the dust can almost be tasted during the hotter regions and the plunges into the creekbeds feel almost refreshing. The mud actually washes off of your vehicle when plowing through water. The trucks will flip over but not often and there is no explosions or machines breaking down that I saw exception like my windshield smashed out once and parts may fall off of the truck, but it is pretty much a vehicular goreless game. The only thing that ever stopped me was meandering into too deep water and something about my exhaust getting flooded.There is an incredible depth to the simulation aspects of this title. With many ways to overcome obstacles- such as simply finding another route around, power-winching over it, depressurizing tires to soften your friction, plus more. Therefore each track COULD be mastered by finding what works best with what accessory or truck in the turbulent and primal landscape. And if you don't do it correctly or turn at a point just a little early/late, then possibly it will warrant a restart. Unfortunately a restart is what the controls need and a tune up as much.I had originally voted this a thumbs up, but after puting it up for awhile then coming back I see what made me quit playing in the first place.

												Couldn't even make it past the tutorial because it stopped giving me proper instructions half way through.  Also, what sort of Xbox 360 controller control scheme makes you push Shift on your keyboard plus another key on the controller to accomplish something?			",282,44,18,34,20,7,46

												Although the game appears to be dead from a development viewpoint, I'm still writing this.There are a few things that need reworked in the game; Object boundaries are pretty shoddily done, the respawn system is pretty infuriating, vehicle handling, and the vehicles ability to turn their wheels.First, object boundaries, its pretty obvious when you're in rocks that the boundaries of the vehicles and the rocks are pretty lax. By this, I mean the game will register that the object are colliding when on screen they aren't. This will make taking a particular line difficult, its pretty infuriating when you should be able to make it up a ledge but the game won't let you. I can tell that this was done to ease the work needed in programming and less processing to do client-side, it would be nice to see it refined, however. This also ties into #5, vehicles ability to turn their wheels, more when I get there, though.Respawn system, the forced respawn is rather annoying, there have been countless times when I was forcibly respawned even though I wasn't in the situation it was telling me I was. I think forced respawn should be removed and a 'You appear to be stuck, would you like a penalty-free respawn?' should be in its place. There's just no excuses for the respawn, something like that should have been fixed long ago.Vehicle handling is another spot that I can had corners cut to ease the work on the devs. When vehicle handling is lower, the vehicle isn't harder to handle, it simply won't respond to inputs as well. Yes, this is essentially the same thing, however its not. When handling is low, the vehicle simply refuses to do what you're telling it to do, IE. solid ground, full lock steering, and going 4 KPH the vehicle should turn very sharply, there is no reason for it not to, however it simply refuses to turn due to the handling mechanisms in the game. Torque, this is kinda in with the traction mechanisms of the game, low gear isn't as powerful as it should be. In most 4-wheel drive vehicles 4-low is almost unstoppable, however in the game the vehicles get bogged down far too easily. The vehicle get far too much 'traction' this is tied in with the object boundaries being lax.(Un)fortunately, this is the only game that I have found that fills this genre (Hardcore Offroad Racing), so I would have to say its the best one like it. I would recommend it because it isn't a horrible game, it just needs work to refine it.  ",65,13,4,9,26,0,3

												this is a good offroad game. the problem is its to easy once you have figured out the correct vehicle to use and the setup its easy. each track has a certain vehicle you use. do not worry about the ghost car. as long as you do good on the course you can still take first. the rockcrawl if done right does not take a winch. you do need the keyboard along with the xbox controllerif you suck at this game do not blame the developers blame yourself this game is to easy but alot fun.

												With such great potential Off-Road Drive felt like it was going to be one of the best off-roading games ever, only one let down. No multiplayer at all. Contrary to the official website this game features a multiplayer section that fails to work. I even downloaded and used Hamachi & Tunngle with a friend and still no online co-op play. With such potential it is extremely sad that the makers have failed with this game. I only hope that a patch is released to fix this massive issue![UPDATE]Since I last posted this review back on the 28th of December 2012 I have since then found a fix to be able to play multiplayer/co-op with a friend in Off-Road Drive. If you are reading this and you would like to know the fix just message me.			",40,2,3,2,4,0,2
