												For $5 this is a decent game and it is a bit of fun. graphics look decent, tracks are well layed out and it has a decent but small collection of cars. biggest problem with the game is the handling which is a bit like driving a front wheel drive car with maccas trays under the rear wheels. it just doesnt feel like you are driving a rwd car at all.  also controller support would be nice but its not too bad playing on a keyboard once you get used to the weird handling.in all for $5 i think the game is worth it and i do recommend it for a bit of fun, but would like to see controller support implemented and the handling much improved before i recommend it to someone who is into drifting.
