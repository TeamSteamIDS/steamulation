												Note: If your biggest problem with TrackMania Turbo is the Uplay implementation, stop reading now. I'm not a fan either, but this review will do nothing to challenge your opinion.And so we begin...Read through the negative reviews and you'll begin to see a pattern emerge. A depressing, banal pattern. A group of people so deeply ingrained into their own cosy society they fail to see the forest for the trees.TrackMania Turbo does not let you customise your avatar. Shocker! Nor does it let you customise your car, your name, your horn or your server. I mean, strictly speaking, it does let you customise three of those things, but not in the same way its predecessor, TrackMania 2 did. You'll unlock new skins and stickers as you progress through the game, and hosting a multiplayer session supplies you with more or less all of the options you'd reasonably expect from a game of this type. Happy times, right?But wait. This isn't good enough for the snivelling elite. ""Why can't I choose my OWN avatar?"" they cry. ""What if I want to assault players' ears with some Katy Perry while they drive?"", ""Why am I unable to smear their screens with ugly and pointless UI elements, just so I can enjoy a modest sense of authority?"". The previous TrackMania game was undoubtedly far more open in terms of customisation. The reality is, however, that most of it was trash. I'm sorry, but custom horns and car skins are NOT that exciting and the majority of private servers looked as though someone had just eaten a phone book and promptly thrown up over the screen. Enough of that bullcrap about consoles dumbing down PC games, TrackMania was in desperate need of a clean up. And that's precisely what Nadeo have done. They've scraped off the scum and revealed a sparkling core underneath. Let me describe said core.Put simply, TrackMania can be described as a hotlap racer. The aim of the game is not to outwit your opponents in a head-to-head battle, but to master the track. This goal is enforced by the fact you're not actually able to collide with other cars at all. In both single player and online, other racers are essentially ghosts, forming vague representations of your opponents and their efforts to set low lap times. To put it simply, your biggest enemy is yourself. You'll repeat tracks over and over in quick succession, tapping the reset/restart buttons whenever the slightest mistake is made and slowly but surely, edging your way ever closer to perfection. Once you complete a lap (or several, in multilap events) your time will be awarded and your position displayed; bronze, silver or gold in single player and your rank versus other players in online matches. Then you'll hit the restart button for the thousandth time, because you know you can do better.In many racing games, this style of play could rightfully be considered dull, but not here. You've probably noticed via the promotional material that TrackMania tracks are out of this world cer-ay-zay. Drifting? Check. Blistering high speeds? You got it. Twists, loops, ramps, quarter pipes, magnetic tracks, jumps, wall rides and nail-biting close calls with brick walls? Par for the course, my friend! This is the true essence of TrackMania. The beating heart. The reason you came. And the same can be said for all TrackMania games. They're fantastic. The single thread that runs through the series, the one unifying theme that ties the franchise together... is the track design and the ability to create your own tracks. That hasn't gone anywhere. It's present in TrackMania Turbo and quite possibly better than ever. On the subject of unity, another point of contention seems to be the apparent separation of the player base. This is probably going to come across as patronising, but... yeah, that's kind of the nature of sequels. The general idea is that most players switch over, new players join and only a few stragglers are left behind. If you really want to whine about separation, direct it at the previous game. You know, the one that split each environment into individual releases. The truth is that TrackMania Turbo has done more to fix the separation issue than it has to worsen it. The more people move forward and pick it up, the more unified the community will be.Now, I'm not saying this is a flawless game. I have a modest, slowly growing list of issues I'd like to see addressed with a patch, but I had a list for the previous game too. A fairly sizeable list, if I'm honest. However, stepping back, taking a look at what really matters and focusing your attention on those central suppliers of enjoyment is all it takes to prove that ALL TrackMania titles are games worth playing. TrackMania Turbo being no exception.			",390,83,18,30,44,6,44

												What an utter disappointment. No dedicated servers, no local or Dedimania leaderboards online, no customization of cars or nicknames, no way to hide your opponents, only 100 players max, a dumbed down console port that treats its users as a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and on top of that forces you to install and always log onto Uplay.I've been playing ALL Trackmania games since the first game came out 13 years ago. Trackmania United is by far my favorite, though Trackmania Stadium 2 ain't too bad either. Trackmania never really was a $60 AAA game; it's a fun game which you can jump into and play for 30 mins and then alt+f4 back to reality. It's a chill game series but has the ability to let you practice for hundreds of hours to master the fine physics to become the best. Trackmania Turbo is not that kind of a game.Trackmania Turbo is mediocre, and it disappoints in so many areas. This is the first game in the series that forces you to install a third party client called Uplay. Why this nonsense? Not any particular reason, it's apparently just how Ubisoft deal with all their games. You can't opt out from it at all. You gotta make a separate account and then log into both Steam and Uplay every time you wanna play the game. It sucks. Another thing is max 100 players. This isn't impressive at all if you've played the previous games where there have been 700 players online on one server fighting for the podium. PCs can handle that. Stop forcing PC gamers to follow the console limitations.I really looks as if they just took the shell of the previous games and add some restrictions and removed some freedom and customization. I'm requesting a refund but might buy it at the summer sales if it's like 85% off.Don't waste your money.			",73,11,7,4,23,3,15

												A lot of people have the wrong idea about Trackmania Turbo. They are seeing it as a sequel to Trackmania 2 (also known as ManiaPlanet). The fact of the matter is that TMT is infact, NOT a sequel. It is merely a spin off for consoles, except that the developers brought it to PC so we wouldn't miss out too. If you approach TMT as a side project, and not a sequel to TM2, then it is a very fun, enjoyable experience. It has all the stuff that is required for fun times with friends and other players online. Up to 4 player splitscreen, Double Driver mode (where two people control one car), and, of course a single player mode and track editor. For those of you who are freaking out about the 'consolified' editor, calm down! The classic editor is still there, to access it, start making a new map, and then you just need to move your mouse up to the top of the screen (so the menu bar shows), and click on the cog/gear, and choose the classic editor :)For video makers, the video editor is still there, too. It's accessed the same way (via the menu bar's cog/gear) on any of the main menus. Physics-wise, Nadeo seem to have tweaked the handling of existing environments (Canyon, Stadium, and Valley). None of the tweaking has rendered the environments bad to play, and they still retain their exclusively different handling styles. I can't give a complete coverage of optimization, as my system is fairly powerful. However, I have not had any performance issues at all, and no crashing either. However, it's running the exact same engine as Trackmania 2, so if you can run that, then you probably won't have any troubles running this!Sadly, you cannot paint your car in a detailed way in this game (like in Trackmania 2). This, again, is because it is a spin off side game for consoles, that was also released on PC to keep us happy. I won't complain - they could have not released the game at all for PC. All in all, this is a very solid fun game, and is worth picking up if you like fast-paced, skill based racing. Final rating: 8/10 (two points lost for track complexity limit, this could have easily been disabled for PC!).			",44,6,33,2,6,0,0

												This is a pretty hard review to make, because Trackmania Turbo really isn't a bad game at all. Nadeo did a great job at optimizing it, with even my potato managing a smooth 60 frames at lowest settings. The game still looks great, even with the options cranked down. It is nice to see that they made sure it would run on lower end computers. The aesthetic, while goofy at times, is still pleasing and definitely is welcome change up. They even managed to mostly hit the addictive nature of the series, with the ""just a little faster"" mentality really showing through. Unfortunately though, the game bleeds compromise. I don't want to be the type of person to say that devs should make their games exactly like the previous installments. Fans can really stop Devs from trying something new or creating a creative game from an existing title. Series that produce new games with only some new levels and a fresh coat of paint are walking a fine line. Racing games are hard to make creative sequels for though. There is only so much one can change in a racing game without compromising what makes the racing game unique. Nadeo did a good job with Trackmania 2, changing up the pace a bit with a rally mode, among other things. Turbo though, appears to completely changed up some core concepts of Trackmania to an unwelcoming degree. Alot of the fun came from Trackmania's extremely unique take on racing. The cars where responsive to an unrealistic degree, and gripped the track like a magnet. The challenge, especially in later levels, would be maintaining speed in an increasing chaotic and cramped track. You had all the tools though to floor it, the question was did you have the skill. It was an idealized version of racing, where cars never skidded out, and one could restart at the push of a button. Wanted to go 600 kmh on a completely vertical curved portion of a wall? Why not? I have yet to play a game that approaches driving exactly the way Trackmania does. Turbo appears to have gone the route of its contemporaries though, and features a more realistic idea of driving. The cars have weight, and will do more normal car things. In doing this, they have made the game feel less precise. It is not to the level of weight of Need for Speed or Burnout have, but appears to be a mix of these games and classic Trackmania. It feels more precise than alot of it's rivals, but, unfortunately, is kinda easy like them as well, and has mechanics that could have been approached in a more Trackmania way. For example; I don't mind added blatant drifting to the game, but here it is incredibly simple. I expect a technique that allows one to cut off such large amounts of time to be a challenge to pull off, but it isn't at all. In the previous games drifting was difficult to control, and would only save time if one really understood how it worked. Here it seems to be thrown in because it is expected, or because it looks cool, not really to be an advanced technique to help one on the quest for the shinnies. This kinda sums up the game though. It is simply a gentrification of an already established series. Past installments have been completely community run. Nadeo lays out the frame work, and the community goes nuts. Here though, with the addition to a console port, Ubisoft has appeared to have forced Nadeo to turn it into every other game, with mechanics vaguely reminiscent of past titles, but mostly missing the mark. The car customization is laughable, and really doesn't feel like you are being creative in the slightest. The lack of community servers is sad, and even pc ports of other console games often have this. It has lost the community driven attitude of the past games, with only the track editor really remaining. Every decision has appeared to make the game more generic, to entice more people to try out the series. Only when one stops to sit though does one wonder why it was done in the first place. Why is there a random track option? It is a neat concept, but the tracks end up feeling imprecise and not very satisfying. Couldn't this time and money have been spent on something better. Apparently noEvery new feature or mechanic seems like a ploy by Ubisolf to entice more fans, but all seem to really lack depth. Am I going to spend more than five minutes with a friend on the two controllers one car mode? Probably not. I would rather race them one on one instead. It is amazing how long the last games have lasted with only a (admittingly amazing) track editor and community servers options. Here though, not only have they added a bunch of gimmicky features, but also made the game feel less skill based and more generic. It isn't a bad game. There is nothing wrong with pretty racing games that make you feel like you are going a million miles an hour and that have drifting that make you feel like Ken Block. But to not only lower the skill ceiling of one of the hardest racing games out there, but to also completely change its focus from community driven to something else is sad. I suppose it was inevitable, with Ubisoft being the publisher and whatnot, but it is still a disappointment to see.This is all coming from the perspective of a fan though. To those who haven't played or haven't enjoyed past Trackmania games, you should defiantly give it a go. It has fast racing, a great sense of speed, an addictive time trail mode, and gorgous visuals. To those expecting a new Trackmania game though, look elsewhere. ",171,31,7,13,8,3,2

												I've been a longtime Trackmania fan, and this is the most fun I've had in a Trackmania game.Trackmania Turbo is a skill-based hotlap racing game where you play in one of four unique environments on an infinite variety of player-made (or randomly generated) tracks. It's fast, it's difficult, it's technical, and it's crazy fun.Pros:-New environment (Lagoon Rollercoaster) feels like a remake of the Snow environment from TMUF, and it looks amazing-Completely updated UI (It looks fantastic now. There are no 'janky' looking default font text labels popping up on the screen.-Cool new art direction (All of the signage, scenery objects that are present in all environments)-Unified gameplay experience (No need to close the game and open another just to play a different environment)-Double Driver is a really fun new multiplayer mode-New parts and smoother gameplay for existing environments-Huge singleplayer campaignCons:-From what I can tell, you can't save or edit your replays at this point. I hope this is either a planned or accidentally hidden feature.-Less customization than previous Trackmania games (for example, no custom car models)**This might not really be a bad thing. I personally prefer the more coherent art style that this forces.-You can't reassign controller inputs. The default layout is okay, but I'd prefer using the right analog stick for acceleration and brake (the default layout maps it to nothing at all).Should you buy it?-It's not an essential purchase if you are already invested in TM2, or if you prefer the deep customization of TM2.If you're looking to get into Trackmania, or if you want a more unified experience, this game is worth getting. Despite the bad reviews, this game is highly appealing and very fun in my opinion, and I think you'll have fun with it too. Best ""6 out of 10 -Steam"" I've ever played.			",60,11,6,6,8,0,2

												Trackmania Turbo was supposed to bring some fresh air into the series. The environments seem fun even though it's basically just the previous 3 environments plus a new one, but the COMPLETELY console focused gameplay ruins it, especially when playing the Rollercoaster Lagoon environment with keyboard instead of a controller. In addition to that the UPlay requirement completely disconnects TMT from the previous games, which means I can't really play with some of my old friends anymore.Trackmania Turbo takes a good chunk of what was fun in the previous parts and turns them into something that is barely any good. Customization is now limited to paintjobs only, and not even different paintjobs per environment. Thanks to Uplay you can't change your nickname in ways you could do it before, and stuff like horns, avatars, custom car models/skins are all gone. Dedicated servers are also gone, which means that servers (or rather lobbies) can only be hosted on Nadeo's services, giving the host barely any control over how the server works and also eliminates things like Dedimania.Overall Trackmania Turbo is really disappointing in a lot of aspects that made the Trackmania series so iconic and fun.As a veteran, I am disappointed.But since there is a demo out there, I'd recommend people to try it before making a choice on buying this game.=====================Edit: I'm gonna add some more stuff to my review since it has caused quite a discussion.The main reason why I dislike Trackmania Turbo is because it leaves the existing Trackmania community behind, a lot of community driven features are not present in Turbo, the multiplayer doesn't allow for custom servers. The number one community feature just gets dropped for some lame-♥♥♥ wannabe server system, allowing for no customization at all, no jukebox, no plugins, no dedimania to compare your times against the world and the server itself. What is Trackmania without record-hunting? Leaderboards exist, yes, but they're practically useless.Turbo doesn't allow saving/editing replays for videos or exporting tracks to upload them on stuff like TMX, one of the community-heavy features that made Trackmania as big as it is today and effectively killing off those communities (for this game at least.)The game itself is okay, but the fact that Nadeo disregards what made Trackmania such a success is simply outrageous.

												THIS ISNT TRACKMANIA! THIS IS AN ABORTION!I'm sorry - Its a typically Ubisoft product.Once again you destroyed another legendary game franchise.There was a big scene and community about TM for years, but now its gone.-NO DEDICATED SERVERS-NO DEDIMANIA PLUGINS ETC.-NO CUSTOMIZATION (HORN, AVATAR, ETC)-TRACKBUILDER IS CRAPWhy did they change the most important things we loved in TM?What were they thinking? I'm just pi*sed - nothing more to say. really pi*sed. It hurts to see my favorite racing game of all time getting rap#ed from these devs. You owe us something ubisoft. It was a big mistake to buy one of your products - every release you did in the last years speaks for itself. I hope people realise what kind of games you are producing - there is absolutely no passion to produce a game with an active community that lives longer than 6 months, I am not a f**king cow! I'm just a gamer who wanted to play TM - but I can't have fun with this one :-( A VERY SAD DAY FOR MEP.S.: I would change my rating and review once our old TM is back and the missing things are implemented again			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oke so as a long time Trackmania fan. I have to give my opinion of this. Stated in other reviews below me this game is quite a dissapointment. First of all, like many have already pointed out, Lackluster customization. Basicly none if you ask me. Get a bunch of medals and earn some skin for your car that looks like ♥♥♥♥. even with the Uplay ''Legendary skins'' your car will look like ♥♥♥♥. Slap some stupid sticker on your car that you CANNOT place yourself.2nd. Where the absolute ♥♥♥♥ is the save recordings button? better yet, where the ♥♥♥♥ is the edit replay section? i love playing around in edit replay mode to try and capture some cool shots of me driving a map. Speaking of maps......3rd. Trackbuilder,,,,,Holy ♥♥♥♥♥. The amount of console peasantry in the trackbuilder is insane, the 1st thing you will notice when you enter this mode is that you have to move the blocks you want to place with the arrow keys.....like wtf? yes...this was advanced edit mode.4rd. Uplay. No further discussion needed.5. No dedicated servers. Speaks for itself. No customization on servers.If you are looking for an arcade racer game to play for 30 mins to an hour. and not deal with anything else. Yea, go ahead and buy the game. However, if you are a previous TM fan and want to customize, edit replays etc....Stay away from this! Buy it when its on sale.			",96,11,3,6,5,0,0

												Overpriced console port. The Canyon Drift vehicle is the only fun one to drive. The Buggies are bouncy and twitchy and 90% of the challenge with them is having to line them up perfectly strait for that upcoming loop to loop or a jump that you need to be going full speed to make. Trackbuilder is an unintuitive mess. Massive pain to make anything fun that doens\'t rely on the default 90 degree turns. Weird interface that comes and goes at times where you\'d need an input legend most. Audio options are appalling. Music: on, off, loud? Was one of the few games I looked forward to this year and I probably would have looked into a refund if my nephew hadn\'t wanted to play the game with me so much but even he got tired of the \""you weren\'t perfectly strait coming off of that bumpy sand drift  onto the turbo ramp! sucks to be you!\"" antics.

												TL:DR: In any case, the game is highly recommended. The gameplay remained the same and has even been improved in some aspects, while some restrictions have been applied that ultimately don't make the game less fun, no matter how much the community may want to tell you otherwise. The new of the four enviroments, Lagoon, is awesome. Simply said, it is a streamlined trackmania game that kept all the fun parts and threw out the unnecessary ones - like lean meat that is still delicious. Don't listen to the others, buy it if you are interested in Trackmania.Long version:I must say, I am very disappointed. No, not in the game - in the reviews.I should first say that I have been playing trackmania for a long time - since around 2008, both online and offline, on LAN's and even one tournament.There are a lot of ""supposedly"" Trackmania-Veterans giving reviews here, thumbing the game down. They say that it sucks that the game has a lot less costumization compared to the other Trackmania games. They say it sucks that there are no dedicated servers. They say it sucks that the limit is now 100 players per server. They say that because of all of those reasons, it is a bad game. None of those reasons, none of those reviews, talk about the game itself. Why? It is great. And that the customization is gone is so bad?I say, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This was never what made Trackmania a great game. Sure, it was neat to customize your name and car in great detail, import new models, honks and even SFX, track graphics - all of that is gone now. And it has a reason it is gone - this is not supposed to be a successor to the old Trackmania games. It is it's own game, simply because it got a console release at the same time - it isn't connected to Maniaplanet, so that means a new community will form that is supposed to span consoles too.Yes, it sucks that a lot of community features are gone, but what does it matter? What makes Trackmania great - always has and always will - is the GAMEPLAY. And the gameplay is top notch. Racing online or offline is fun, fast, fluid and feels even more improved than it already has in the previous trackmania games. The trackbuilder is as varied and versatile as ever, allowing you to make some great creations and upload them for everyone to play. 4 Enviroments are there - Canyon, Valley, Lagoon and Stadium, all with different properties that require you to learn them and, even more than that, learn how your car behaves. The game is - simply - fun. Online play, even without dedicated servers, is still great - especially if you go to a server that plays random maps (the random trackbuilder isn't that great most of the time but it does provide some laughs and - most importantly - a somewhat even playing field. Still, Trackmania is and always has been about skill no matter what.) All of these negative reviews drive people away from what would otherwise be a great game - just because of Uplay and because the customization is largely gone? (You can still choose how your car looks and the choices aren't even that bad - the more gold medals you unlock, the more choices you have.)And this is what is funny to me. For years now Trackmania-Veterans have complained about the lack of players. They wanted a game that could bring new people into the trackmania series and provide them with an entry point, considering that most of the other Trackmania games have been seperately sold based on enviroment, aside from United (Trackmania Valley, Trackmania Canyon...). THIS GAME IS AN ENTRY POINT. And what do they reply? ""Oh no, it is too dumbed down, so much stuff is missing bla bla bla"" Stuff that only matters to someone who DOES NOT KNOW WHAT TRACKMANIA IS ABOUT. In the process, they drive players away. And then they start complaining again, about how Trackmania doesn't have enough players.This is a great game. Buy it. If you are new to Trackmania, you will love it and I urge you to also try the older games. If you are a veteran, buy it anyway. A lot of the customization is gone and the game as a whole feels more streamlined - but THAT IS OKAY. It is not supposed to be a successor to the PC-trackmanias. It is it's own game. And what made trackmania great, the gameplay, the fast and fluid racing, the surprising courses by the community - all that is there and it looks better than ever. All that has changed is that you can't assault people with customized ""Let the bodies hit the floor"" Honks or race around with your ♥♥♥♥ing Hatsune-Miku painted car. If this is all that ever mattered to the community, then well - maybe this community isn't as welcoming as they would always want to be. But this is it's own game, it's own community. It is up to you to shape it to become less elitist than the old one.It does everything it needs to well. The only negative point I can see is Uplay and even so - Uplay isn't as bad as a lot of people may want you to believe, though I do agree it is useless in this context, considering this game is sold on Steam. And while I do not absolutely love Uplay - let's be honest, it is okay. Just okay though.			",226,55,13,37,7,0,18

												The very thing you should know is that it's a CONSOLE SPIN-OFF to TrackMania series.This is NOT a new TrackMania we've all expected. This is a lazy PC-port of a console adaptation. There's no modability, customization or dedicated servers in here, and community was informed about it in long advance via forums and Steam  discussions. You may go and check for yourself, it's in sticked topics.Moreover, the lifespan of TrackMania 2 is not over yet. Some people say it's confirmed that Rollercoaster Lagoon titlepack is coming to TM2 soon. But be advised that TM2 goes off better with stand-alone ManiaPlanet launcher, not with Steam. If the release of TM2 Valley was the last time you checked on the game, you may want to go and give it a try now - a lot has changed since.The problem is that Ubisoft, the publisher, advertises the game as The One And Only Shiny Brand New Installment in the acclaimed series and puts a corresponding price tag on it. For this deception driven by greed they deserve all the dislikes and low rating.What worries me is that some people may mistake Ubisoft's policy for Nadeo's one. Believe me, (non-independent) developer has no word in commercial questions. Nadeo has no intention to fool us and gives us as much hints to what is really happening as they can.

												When I first reviewed this game I was a bit ""hot headed"" because even though I knew this game was a console port, I didn't expect it to lack so many features from the previous games. But after playing it so much I decided to change my review.Why should you buy this game? (This is mostly aimed to new players to the Trackmania series)-First and foremost, the game is really fun-New Double Driver mode-New Stunt mode-You can create challenges and publish them for the world to see-As an arcade game, Turbo is really easy for anyone to get into it and have fun, but its gameplay also has depth, so the possibilities are almost infinity and it will take you a long time to master the gameplay of each environment-3 environments already known in the series and 1 brand new environment called 'Rollercoaster Lagoon', each one with an unique and original gameplay mechanics-Hundreds of campaign tracks made by Nadeo-You can create your own tracks with 4 different editors (each one with a different 'complexity level')-The game's 'art style' is really amazing, everything is colorful and vivid, it makes you feel like the world around you is really alive, especially in the Stadium environment that in my opinion is the comfiest of them all. Sometimes I play the game just to look at the visuals-The game is really well optimized and runs on any toasterWhy shouldn't you buy this game? (This is mostly aimed to old Trackmania players)-Can't create dedicated servers with custom plugins-No Dedimania, so there is no way (in-game) to compare you time against the top players' times-The powerful 'Classic' Trackbuilder doesn't support controllers-I can't 'take down' or 'erase' the challenges I've have published, once a challenge it's up it stays in the cloud forever-Very limited graphics options (in-game and in the launcher). For instance, I can't disable only the annoying bloom without lowering all other shader effects along with it-You can't rename the tracks you've created-Scrolling up and down on the leaderboards during a race is really clunky-Can't see more than a few cars in the track at once (while in TM2 you could see more than a 100 cars)-The opposite of the complaint above, you can't turn other players' ghosts off (some people like seeing other cars but some people don't, especially if you are in competitive server)-No 3D custom skins-No custom nickname (hexadecimal colors, bold, etc)-No custom horn-Horrible console UI-Unnecessary Uplay requirement-Can't remap controller input (They fixed this with a patch, but at the launch this feature was not present)-Still no XInput support for the triggers (They fixed this with a patch, but at the launch this feature was not present)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL/DR: wait for a 50% sale! - at leastI really enjoy the racing part of the game while my focus is on track building.You have 4 different modes of editing tracks, each having its pros and cons, but there is no way to switch them - once you've started a new track and selected the mode, you have to stick with it - ok... awesome!And that's only one of the nonsense limitations of TMT's editor. You can't name your tracks, they get numbered by the game and that's it. You can't really manage uploaded tracks... no way to delete or change once uploaded. All you can do is to edit a copy and upload a new version.Still not too bad and i may be able to live with that, but then they decided that there should not be dedicated servers.... You got a room where you can add tracks and change some basic settings, but you have to actively play in there or at least 1 player sitting in there (once you've launched it) or the room will be shut down until you launch it again.And last but not least the track sharing. No sort by 'rating' or 'times played', just a vast sea of randomly numbered tracks with a tiny picture which may or may not give some insight into the track. Ok, you can filter/sort by 'environment', 'style', 'length' and 'time uploaded' or 'latest played'... kinda helpful if you keep in mind how many tracks are uploaded/played per hour, isn't it?... If only the rating thingy wont be quite useless! Why? Well, at the end of each race there will be a rating. There are 3 options: like, skip, dislike. Somehow the game decides on its own which one will be selected by default and the player has like 3 seconds to change the selection. Nice, at the very moment right after the pure action, where most players lean back and chill for a few seconds, the rating happens and the game decides which vote will happen by default if there is no player input... so most of the votes are made by nadeo - well done!TMT could have really been an awesome follow-up, but the devs cut off so many things that it's nothing else than a huge disappointment in the end.

												The solo mode in this edition of Trackmania is polished, with good tracks and a nice difficulty level for players of various skill levels. But apart from that, the game is lacking so many features compared to previous Trackmania games on PC that I cannot recommend it. In particular, community-related things are almost gone, while this was one of the strengths of the series.Worse, the game developers are banning people who express a negative opinion on their forums, preventing any honest discussion. So if you are going to buy this game you'd better like it, do not dissent or you might find yourself banned!			",59,2,5,2,6,1,17

												Pros:- Campaigns in TM have always been very good, and this one is as well.- Runs better than TM2, especially Valley. No Frame drops.- All environments in 1 game.- A few new blocks for the editor compared to TM2.- Visually the game looks great.Cons:- No dedicated servers- New editor layout is terrible and annoying to use (even though there is an option for the classic editor, but you must change it each time)- No more car customization - custom skins/horns/models - gone.- No more nicknames if you have a clan.- Official campaign times are gone.- No more local server records or Dedimania records.- Track Editor doesn't allow you to name tracks anymore - just numbers.- You used to be able to find all your maps in the file explorer so you could share it on sites like TMX/MX, now that's gone you're left with just uploading to a public room or something.- Lagoon physics and car speeds are weird (even Island wasn't that fast).- CAM 7 is gone - this was generally just a really useful free camera in previous TM games if you got stuck on a map, or to look around the map while playing.- Online scoreboard in servers is just a mess.- Replay editor is now hidden for some reason in the top right cog wheel - that's probably one of the best features of Trackmania and it's not even noticeable now (I only found out when someone told me).To be honest I think you're better off buying the TM2 environments seperately because you have way more customization and there is a big community full of fun mods for the game like skins, models, maps, videos, servers etc. This game just feels like a stripped down version of TM2 - I don't see a real difference, so I wouldn't really recommend it. And this is coming from a TM Veteran since 2006.			",49,4,7,3,10,0,2

Introduction:I've played basically every Trackmania game prior to the Trackmania 2 - series coming out, and thought it might be a good Idea to pick up a copy of this game primarily due to the fact that it's not 30 bucks for a single environment. I was looking for it to fill the void that the older titles left a couple of years back.So I got it and played through the ""White Series""-tracks to test the general feel of each car/environment, took a quick look at the editor and customization, played a bit of multiplayer and went on to write this review/impression.The tl;dr conclusion is that, yes, I like it and I would recommend it. Since there's a whole bunch of negative reviews, though, I feel like mentioning their arguments and adding my own opinion to them.A couple of criticisms I would like to adress beforehand: This will require uPlay to play. No way around. The game will default to controller prompts. It will also make your controller vibrate if plugged in and playing with keyboard. I don't know where people got the idea of this having no audio options at all: hover over the top area of your screen, you will find a black bar containing audio sliders for master volume, music and sound volume. It's probably not the most expansive audio menu, but I think it does all it needs to do. No dedicated servers: I suppose since this is a console port, PC was not the target demographic and therefore got left behind in that regard. It's a shame really, but I wasn't into TM for the community's sake in the first place. It don't bother me all that much. Gameplay:The cars do feel different to the ones in prior Trackmania titles, and while it took some getting used to I don't think they're better or worse than before. They feel like they have a lot of weight behind them which makes them seem a lot more realistic and it feels as if every little mistake is punished even harder this time around. The basic gameplay loop hasn't changed, you try a course, fail, and try again until you have basically mastered every turn, every jump, every drift and so on. Cars having no collision in multiplayer adds to this ""Trial & Error"" type of gameplay, in which you always compete for the best time.I've heard people complain about handling, but I've had no issues with it so far. The game never made me feel like I failed for any reason other than me legitimately ♥♥♥♥ing up. Feels true to the Trackmania spirit for me.Graphics:The graphics have been severely upgraded from back in the days. What I remember being, compared to this, rather cutesy and comic-ish in older games now looks really solid and realistic. The 4 different environments do a lot to differentiate themselves from each other as well as previous environments, while still integrating some familiar elements here and there. I wouldn't go so far as to call the graphics amazing in and of themselves, but I think the tracks can look breathtakingly cool and overall, you'll still have to admit the graphics look pretty decent.Environments:Since the International Stadium is basically a carbon copy of Trackmania Nations' Stadium environment and Canyon Grand Drift and Valley Down & Dirty  are strongly reminiscent of the original Trackmania's Desert and Rally environments, I'm not going to go into a lot of depth on those.Rollercoaster Lagoon, my personal favourite, however feels like a completely original environment. I'm surprised I haven't seen more games go down this route, as the rollercoaster courses take an awesome basic concept and make it their own. Those tracks combine the rather chill atmosphere of Trackmania Sunrise's levels and add a whole other set of giant magnetic rollercoaster parts to it that make you feel like you're actually controlling one, as ridiculous as that sounds.The amount of different pieces you can use to design your track make every one of them feel diverse and original.Customization:Yes, the old style of customizing every little detail of your car's paintjob and your avatar is gone. Does it make the game worse, though? Now, I don't think so, but I've never been too much into the customization aspect. Back when I played the first Trackmania, I would take about 10 to 20 minutes each to customize my cars. When I went back to play it or any of the following games, I would pick a premade paintjob and be happy with it and the additional 30 minutes I got out of that. There seems to be a good number of premade paintjobs which are unlocked through beating the in-game challenges, and I probably won't ever see the entirety of them, so I'm satisfied in that regard.Editor:All those screaming and raging about the old editor: it's still there. This game was a console-port iirc, so it makes sense to fine tune the editor to fit a console's input methods and preferably use this method of editing tracks. If you don't like that, you can switch to the old editor by using the ""Settings"" Icon on the in-game taskbar at the top. My only nitpick is that using the old editor apparently converts the map to be edited in that mode only, if that was a deliberate design decision, I don't see the point. It only takes a second or so to convert the maps though, so I don't really have a problem with it.I don't think I really need to say anything about the old editor, it gave you heaps of freedom and made it really easy to design tracks. I'm probably not going to use the console editor, I don't see why anyone on pc would.Multiplayer:While I haven't tried out a lot of multiplayer, and there's been complaints about missing dedicated servers, I decided to quickly hop on a random custom game and see if there were any major issues with the netcode or multiplayer implementation on pc. I didn't experience any. It's the same kind of time attack multiplayer that was present in previous games, so I hazard to guess that it's going to be alright. I can not say for sure if the hardcore-online community that made the original game a success is still going to be pleased by it. In conclusion, it still feels like Trackmania for me, and I will probably keep enjoying it for multiple hours being content with the amount of money I spent (29,99€ on sale). There's little things like the attention to detail (i.e. you can see the suspension work on slopes) that make it seem to me like this game was actually created with the purpose of making another solid entry to the series, and I think they managed.Would recommend to anyone that liked the previous/older titles just on the merit of getting another fix.

												There’s a terrible bias in many of the reviews posted so far. I felt inclined to post my own review to cater to people who may not have a problem with Uplay or Ubisoft. This is largely because real downsides in the game’s design are being completely ignored. Uplay has very rarely caused me problems. Some of the more recent updates to Uplay have made it less “intrusive.” If you already have a Uplay account and other newer Ubisoft games, then there’s absolutely nothing to worry about when it comes to Uplay.Should you buy this game if you are a long time player of Trackmania games? That’s exactly what I did. I’ve been playing different versions of Trackmania for years. My experience with the game is probably different from many PC gamers. I played this game primarily in a couch co-op/party play type of setting with friends. Single player and internet play was something I barely touched during the years that I’ve played previous Trackmania titles. Playing with friends in the same room meant playing hot seat. I’ve played countless hours of incredibly entertaining Trackmania hot seat over the years. My Trackmania gaming experience was based on speed, precision (taking inches off corners) and friendly but aggressive competition. I’ve never not had a version of this game installed somewhere. Does Trackmania Turbo deliver that same experience? Yes. Does it add to that experience? Yes. We now have track and vehicle types that change the way you need to drive because of the handling and terrain combination. This is great because it adds a certain kind of “variety” to the racing. We also have split screen and different multiplayer modes. The new multiplayer modes are where I think the execution was faulty. Modes like “mono screen” are hidden until you provide button codes to activate them. What you can immediately infer is that you’re left to understanding the modes yourself. How do I perform stunts or battle my friends? How do I mix modes up? None of this is immediately obvious. Getting the full hot seat playability out of the game is, unfortunately, a challenge. I fail to see why the game was designed this way. Wouldn't it have been wiser to fully open the local multiplayer modes of the game and provide enough information for us to immediately jump into playing?I can't comment on the difference between the single player and online experience between this game and past games but I can say that the single player is fun and challenging; it is exactly what I expected from Trackmania and more.

												If you've never played a Trackmania before you can defenitely enjoy this game, but if you did play any of the previous Trackmania games you will feel dissapointed. The level editor is laugable compared to the other games and this game seems to be made mostly for console. There also isn't an ability to turn off other cars and there are no dedimania records. The graphics however, look really nice.But the worst of all is: there are 15 people online on average, most of those people play the campaign so prepare to join the fullest server and face 4 other people!Graphics: 8,5/10Replay value: 7/10gameplay fun: 6/10optimalization: 8/10audio: 7,5/10price/worth: 3/10 - I would buy Trackmania² Stadium if you haven't already!Total: 7,5			",692,348,44,53,122,17,92

												Not that mediocre but Trackmania suffers. It feels almost empty. Tracks are dirt and road mostly, not a big deal. I couldn't find anything different yet. I couldn't find the freedom, the difference, the amazing degrees and unbelievable tricks.The gameplay is just so annoying. However you can't really change the controls and it has Partial Controller Support.  Yeah Partial Controller Support. Year 2016. It's a racing game. ♥♥♥♥ me, I should buy this to PS4. Beyond that, Ubisoft is kinda lazy and TrackMania Turbo's pc version is probably worse than console versions.  About online playings ; sadly it has no dedicated servers or dedimania leaderboards etc. Most of people is complaining about this ♥♥♥♥♥. If I speak as myself, it is quite a big problem.  I used to play TrackMania for custom levels, the other's levels. But now, it is ♥♥♥♥ed up. Also I do not welcome non-dedicated servers. Online - dedimania/local leaderboards, meh I defenitely could use it.  PS : There is no graphic options as well.			",775,222,33,66,73,5,104

												First impressions:It's an incomplete (very basic) TM2 with nicer graphics and sound. New environment is not that great, feels like Valley, but it's a bit better IMO. It's not even close to as good as Stadium or Canyon.Definitely not worth AAA money. Get it on sale.14 hours in:I hate Valley with a passion. Controlling the car on dirt is really difficult and most of the time you are fighting the car, not the track. When you initiate a turn it jerks a lot, and it's really difficult to straighten it up and keep it on the line you want. The multiplayer aspect of the game became boring really quickly, because the populated servers host the same campaign maps over and over, that are not that great anyway.The custom maps are available through a ""Worldwide Challenges"" menu where you can find a list of tracks that are built by other people. I haven't tried it out yet, but I have a hunch that the good maps will be burried deep in piles of amateur ... stuff.Going to the campaign, I played up to track #96 and got gold on all so far. The campaign has some nice and fun tracks, but I'd say most of them are average and forgettable so far.What really turns me off in the campaign is the fact that you need to play all environments to advance to the next difficulty level. This meant that instead of playing environments that I love I spent most of the time trying to beat Valley maps. I did insist to get gold on all of them because I thought maybe I hate Valley because I suck at it. I didn't find the fun in it so far, and I am ready to give up.Regarding the pathetic argument that this game was made for consoles and we should give it some slack.. Ha! They can do whatever they want on consoles, but I was sold a PC game for 40 euro and I am reviewing it like it is. There are other PC games out there that give you a lot more value for less than 40 euro.			",106,23,21,5,24,1,20

												NOTE: NADEO HAS SAID THEY WILL BE BRINGING THE NEW ENVIRONMENT, LAGOON, TO TRACKMANIA 2.BUYER BEWARE: This is a game that, although will feel very familar to Trackmania fans, will not be all that welcoming to them. Buy with the knowledge that this is TM2's Canyon, Valley, and Stadium with one new environment/playstyle, but is ultimately lacking in moddable freedom. Although I give it a ""Not Recommended,"" I solely mean that speaking as a TM for veteran TM players. It is not a bad title, and if the lack of modding/dedicated servers doesn't bother you, please pick this up.Let me get this out of the way. Do not be fooled, Trackmania Turbo is a fantastic title. The core gameplay has been refined and tuned significantly. The sense of speed is superb, the driving feels so much better, and the graphics are really beautiful. But, where it shines in a lot of areas, it fails everywhere else.If you're at all familiar to the previous generations of Trackmania then you'll know the following: Trackmania is a content sharing game. Trackmania has always been about dedicated servers where people can upload music tracks, plugins, add custom made community levels, and had a huge modding community primarily for custom car models and skin designs. Trackmania allowed people to have their own unique personality online. There was even an in-game paint editor if you weren't savvy enough to understand editing skins in Photoshop.TRACKMANIA TURBO DOESN'T FEATURE ANY OF THIS ASIDE FROM THE TRACK EDITOR. AND THE TRACK EDITOR DOESN'T WORK WITHOUT A CONTROLLER.And, to be fair, I don't want to say Nadeo doesn't care. This game was pretty much their big introduction to the console scene as their last attempt with the Wii game didn't go so well. When it comes to consoles dedicated servers are never a thing due to Sony/Xbox having gripes about that sorta thing. It should go without saying too that content-sharing custom content wouldn't be possible on the console without making an entire in-game editor as complex as Forza or APB. As a way to still keep the customization a thing, there are a ton of liveries, sponsor emblems, numbers, flags, and metal trimmings you can unlock to customize your stock car. It would appear Nadeo didn't want to completely alienate PC players from a newer installment, but subsquently didn't want to make one version be the ""superior"" version. This is further backed up by Nadeo saying they are going to add Turbo's newest environemnt, Lagoon, into TM2. The community admin for this forum has also claimed that Turbo should not be treated as TM3 as they are completely different expierences.I can't say much about the new game modes but, as it stands, this is not meant for die hard trackmania fans. Yes, custom tracks can still be shared and played. Yes, the gameplay is incredibly refined from TM2 and is, in my opinion, much more fun to play. The only issue is that the content PC players are used to isn't there, and it makes sense why it isn't. It doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad game though. If you're looking for a more streamlined experience where you're less likely to play horrible maps with a community that is much more active than TM2 is right now then do pick this up. It's still a great game... even if it is just Valley/Canyon/Stadium packaged together with a new environement.			",468,64,27,26,22,3,31

												These are the TrackMania environments included in this package...Canyon Grand Drift:-This is the Turbo variant on the Canyon environment from TrackMania 2.-This environment has a heavy emphasis on high-speed drifting.-Offroading generally occurs on flat surfaces, unless you are racing in underground tunnels. It is quite slide-y, which will likely throw new players off. But I found it to be pretty easy to get used to.-Usage of air control is very infrequent.-Driving on loops is incredibly difficult, as the car tends to loose traction when wallriding.-Excellent sense of scale. Big things feel very big, and small things feel small.Down 'n' Dirty Valley:-This is the Turbo variant on the Valley environment from TrackMania 2.-This environment has a heavy emphasis on offroading, understanding where to enter and exit turns, and air control.-Offroading is very difficult and will take some time to learn. I've found that the subtle inputs possible with analog steering are very helpful. Grassy areas seem to slow your car down.-Air control is vital for landing jumps properly, as well as keeping yourself from flying off the track when slopes are a bit too convex.-Wallriding and looping tend to be hit-and-miss in this environment. I can't say that I've nailed down any definitive technique quite yet, but I will tweak this review if I do.-The valley setting is gorgeous and serene.Rollercoaster Lagoon:-This is the Turbo variant on the Lagoon environment, which will be released for TrackMania 2 at some point in the future.-The LagoonCar's turn radius is easily the smallest of all the Turbo environments. It is so small that players will rarely find themselves utilizing braking, drifting, or even lifting off to make it through turns. Thus, the emphasis of Lagoon is primarily on the search for the optimal race line in itself. The challenge here comes from being able to maintain your momentum through slippery sand/grass and slick roads, as well as finding the optimal race line on the brain-melting magnetic rollercoaster track segments that do an excellent job of utilizing 3D space to create very intricate tracks. It also has water bouncing, which is just so great.-This environment, in my experience, has the most difficult offroading. You will mostly find yourself racing on sand, which is very slippery. And your situation certainly isn't helped by the fact that the sloping on the sandy track segments tends to be very convex, and the transitions to and from offroading tend to be very awkward. Grassy segments seem to slow you down. The slick roads take some getting used to, and transitioning to and from them can be awkward.-I haven't found flying off the track to be a big problem when it comes to slopes, even on sand. It just feels awkward. Even so, air control is useful for making your landing after a jump a bit more smooth.-Lagoon is an aquired taste, and said taste is more easily aquired if you've played classic TrackMania. But it is a lot of fun once you start to get good. It is easily the prettiest of the environments. It has the second sexiest car in the game, just behind the one for Stadium. The car feels incredibly heavy, so maintaining your momentum through turns, rollercoaster segments, slick segments, and offroad segments is incredibly satisfying. This environment easily does the best job of all the TrackMania environments to date of utilizing 3D space to make super intricate tracks.International Stadium:-This is the Turbo variant on the Stadium environment from TrackMania Nations Forever, TrackMania United, and TrackMania 2.-This environment doesn't really have a huge emphasis on one particular gameplay mechanic. It just kinda does a little bit of everything. But it does it well. Also, there is water bouncing. Awesome.-This environment has the easiest offroading. While there is definitely less traction than when you drive on asphalt, it is not nearly as chaotic as the other environments. Grass seems to slow you down, but I haven't played many tracks that require you to drive on grass.-This is the environment in which air control is the most heavily utilized. The biggest reason for this is that the Stadium physics aren't nearly as forgiving as the other environments when it comes to landing jumps. You have to use air control to keep your car level with wherever you are going to land so you don't end up losing speed or crashing.-This environment is probably the best of the Turbo environments. It takes the already well-refined formula of Stadium and refines it more, adding more interesting visuals in the process. Also, it has the sexiest Nadeo-made car I've seen to date.Here are some pros and cons...Pros:-Unlike TrackMania 2, Turbo is multiple environments in a single package.-User interface is much prettier and more accessible than previous TrackMania games.-I personally think the way the campaign menus are laid out is really nice.-Horn customization has been excluded. Many people would put this in their cons, but I personally prefer not to have my speakers and headphones assaulted with annoying jingles and ear-♥♥♥♥♥♥ music.-Turbo is easily the prettiest installment in the TrackMania series thus far. Plus, the car models are incredibly sexy and very fitting for TrackMania.-It seems to perform better than TrackMania 2.-Heli-drops as starting lines.-Unlike previous TrackMania games, Turbo does an excellent job of making the cars feel heavy without negatively impacting their handling. It feels less like you are playing with toy cars and more like you are cruising around in full-sized souped-up racing vehicles. It makes carrying your momentum through turns all the more satisfying.-The dynamic music provides an excellent means of feedback and atmosphere.-I found the random track generator to actually be a lot of fun. Because of the random nature of the tracks, you will find that completing many randomized tracks requires the utilization of a lot of unconventional driving skills, such as braking over turbo pads or slowing down at just the right time and place before a jump so you don't overshoot or undershoot the landing. Thus, I'd actually recommend messing around with the random generator if you want to improve your skills in certain environments.-Soundtrack customization.Neutral:-Unlike this game's motto, I would argue that TrackMania is not universally easy to pick up, regardless of the simplicity of its controls. But it is definitely hard to master.-TrackMania Turbo is a spinoff rather than a sequel, so don't worry about this being the new primary formula for TrackMania games to come.-Includes the new Double Driver mode, wherein the vehicle accepts inputs from two players simultaneously.Cons:-Turbo requires Uplay to play. If you purchase it through Steam, it will require Uplay AND Steam to play.-This game has four environments and is more expensive than TrackMania United, which has seven environments and is worth 75% the price of Turbo.-Modding has been removed entirely. The only user-created content in this game comes from a simplistic (but admittedly kinda fun) car painter and a watered-down track builder.-Like all TrackMania games, it can be incredibly frustrating.-The online multiplayer community isn't very active. Like... at all.-Like I said earlier, the track builder has been grotesquely watered down. I'm pretty sure mix mapping is impossible. With the exclusion of modding and custom components, there is no item embedding. According to many people, a lot of components found on the developer-made tracks in the game are not avaliable in the track-builder. While the classic editor feels a lot better and more free than the version the game defaults to, it still has all of these limitations. Plus, you can't name your tracks. You simply assign it a track type and a number for the track is automatically generated.			",84,1,8,4,4,0,1

												TrackMania makes it's way to consoles, expanding it's borders and supposedly bringing many new players to the game. But it seems that Nadeo has forgotten about it's PC players. There isn't basic stuff like control remapping and proper graphics settings. There also aren't customisable skins or dedicated servers. The new art style is cool but after playing a little while I've noticed tracks that are IDENTICAL to previous games.Really disappointing.			",113,8,7,13,14,1,11

												Now before you start reading this review - It is still a pretty good game and I sometimes play it, but it´s bad compared to other Trackmania games. So where to begin. This Trackmania has a huge problem of not having the same amount of customization as others. Where are custom models? I want to drive a Hemi Cuda instead of some ugly buggy like car ffs! Where are custom horns? I want V8 engine sound or Darude - Sandstorm as my horn! Where the hell is car painting? I want to have a car shaped barbie ffs! Where are dedicated servers? Dedimania? No? Next thing are controls especially in the Track Builder. I mean, okay i get it, you want to have a game for consoles. But that doesn´t mean building tracks will be extremly uncomfortable and will take enromous amount of time just because the controls are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! GIVE US BACK THE OLD TRACK BUILDING CONTROLS!!!! Also, where the hell is key binding for controlers? I have really cheap controller and yeah of course it doesn´t work properly. I have to go down with my joystick to accelerate! WHAT IS THIS? I WANT TO BIND IT BLOODY HELL! The graphics are nice that´s true, but i was expecting more. They ripped off old trackmania environments and only changed cars and signs! I mean.....If you want a Trackmania game, it´s definitely not this one....It´s not worth 40 euros, just buy a Trackmania 2 Canyon or the good old United Forever, because those games are worth it!

												I have played Trackmania since the early days way back in 2003, since then I have clocked more than 2000 hours across all the games in the series and have enjoyed most of them immensely, so I was overjoyed to hear news of another new title in the making. I pre-ordered it a few weeks in advance and started playing on the day of release, after 90 minutes of play I've requested a refund. This is not the Trackmania I know and love, I get idea of all the environments available to play on the same server, but the handling of the valley cars is so much different to the other cars it just becomes frustratingly impossible. The Stadium mode is also different, I don't know what it is about it, but it feels different, in a bad way. It seems to have lost that edge of the seat feeling of OMG can i hold on to this race, can i win? That's not there.. The whole essence of Trackmania is missing. Stadium is a tough act to follow but this is so far off the mark. Ubisoft, congratulations on screwing up another amazing franchise!			",71,1,3,6,10,0,8

												I played Trackmania United and Stadium a lot and thought a while about the purchase of the new TM Turbo. Bought it before it came out and when the release happened, my first impressions wasn't really great about it. First the Ubisoft-Connection Problem. When the game don't pop up properly, i solved it, when you clear your verify cache on TM Turbo (Library-->TM Turbo-->Rightclick-->Properties-->Local Files-->Verify Cache)  Pro;So about the game itself. It has a very nice campagn with nice tracks. The developers did a great job on the level design. It exists a lot of different tracks. Sometimes you drive on standard racing, sand/island-, rollercoaster-, mountain and grass tracks etc. The graphic/racing flow through the game is pretty amazing and stunning and has for me a long time potential to play this game. The multiplayer went fine - no lags, fast loading. Contra; You can't change your nick or colour them out, like in other TM Games. The players name how is registered on your ubisoft acc is your ingame players name too. In the multiplayer you can't turn other player cars off (or does anyone know how to vanish them? Would be great if there is a solution about this, because it's annoying as f***. Sometimes i think i drive on ice and is in my opinion not 100% sturdily, i think this was better done in TM 2 Stadium. the last thing is about this second textchat ingame, they integrated. Why? Why you need a second textchat if you can write on the standard textchat with other players? This is only good for spaming, nothing else. Overall i would say, if you like racing games, then this is a must have. Yeah it has a lot of negative aspects, but on the whole concept, Nadeo did a really great game here and know that they wouldn't disappoint me. If you are not sure about the purchase, then wait till its on %sale. Rating; 85/100			",75,3,8,5,8,1,2

												It's hard to give a feedback on the game as I've played trackmania for more years in my life than without it. Along comes the pc port of a console port of a pc game. Stripped from proper replay saving and broken replay editing*. No costum cars and skins. No dedicated servers. No leaderboards. No Mixmapping. You can't even name your own f*cking map. You like stadium and want to play through those in the campaign first? Too bad, play through these 30 other maps first.Stunt mode is really fun and gives you a new type of gameplay where you have to do tricks between jumps to get boost. But.. why the f*ck can't you enable it in the mapmaker so you can make maps for it????Core gameplay is still the same, which is the only reason why I give this review a thumbs up.I tried this game with a ps3 controller and it opened a new world for me. I've ben playing valley since its launch and disliked the controls, but after a retry with a controller, I really enjoy it now.I've spent around 20 hrs playing the campaign, which is the most time I've spent on any campaign yet. Im on #43, trying to get trackmaster medal on all.The maps are really well done and artwork and scenery around them is very cool. F*ck multilaps.*When trying to save replays online with other players I cant even get to save my own replay. I drove wr on a track and wanted to save the replay. What I got in the mediatracker was 5 guys copypasted 11 times all over the timeline.There is no way to open multiple replays (except importing replays one by one, which is a pain in the ♥♥♥ if I want to import 1000+ replays) and they removed the feature to record ghosts inside the mediatracker.When finishing a map in solo play you need to finish the map, try it again and press R to save the replay. If you want to create more replays on that map, only your fastest replay will be saved. Let's say you drive it 3 times. 1st, can be saved. 2nd, faster time, can be saved. 3rd, slower than 2nd, therefore 2nd gets saved again			",124,13,6,10,16,0,8

												Where are things what making TrackMania as the Game ... servers only official, max 100 players? Limited Customization? What the heel is this? Familiar name, but only another racing arcade with editor. Game for console can be, but for PC isn't not much for me. Hylis, you probably known my opinion. TrackMania is history, last TrackMania as TrackMania maked from Nadeo under publisher Focus Home Interactive.Ubisoft publish good games, but i hate Uplay (Upay) ... oh sorry, now is Ubisoft Club ...

												Great game but bad PC port. Way behind the possibilities.Weak amount of customization (no import of car models from the internet and only small changes possible)Only 100 players max in online (Canyon even had the 500 players max promoted prior to release)No dedicated serversOnly two cameras, no possibility for better driving viewsVery hard to play with keyboard (especially Lagoon and Valley)90% of all modes are local only (no online possibilities, do you expect me to have a few controllers lying around so others play?)Weak anti aliasing and many graphical bugsWhere can I download and play custom maps? No balancing/adventure maps to play around, no workshop and no custom music possibleThey just made a 1:1 port of the console version, but didn't utilize any of those things for the PC, which is just weak, lazy and disappointing. They shouldn't have bothered with a PC version at all, if they make it this way.Other than that, I can say that the game really makes fun, but it's very disappointing because it could have been the perfect sequel to Trackmania United. They just cut out too many things that were great in the previous titles.			",339,56,18,22,21,2,28

												It's the best Trackmania for newcomers of the series. There is no custom server content, which makes jumping into any server a predictable presentation. No more cluttery HUD. Navigating the menu with a console controller works a lot better than it did in the past games. Graphics and performance seem to be on-par with TM2's.-Pros- Same great gameplay.Better UI.Cleaner HUD.Decent graphics.Great framerate.Easy to attract newcomers.Great fun for experienced players.Works natively with DualShock 4 controller.Plenty of local multiplayer game modes.VR support.-Cons-Uplay is required (takes extra time to launch).MSAA screws with the graphics (either makes the screen solid black or makes the sky flicker).Shadow quality isn't impressibe. Jagged shadows are noticeable at times (same in TM2).Alt-Tabbing takes a very long time.-Conclusion-Buy it! You'll probably love it. If you don't like it, you can get a refund. Trying it out is all it takes.			",151,9,6,2,2,0,2

TL;DRA PC port of a console port of TM2. Save yourself some money and buy Canyon and/or Stadium for $10 and $25 cheaper.I wrote more about it but that review seems to have disappeared so to summarize with the bad first (because the bad outweighs the good):The Bad A nutered Canyon environment. It's as drifty as always, but feels significantly less zippy. I'm a 60k LP player with 140+ hours in Canyon and this new Canyon feels sluggish and not near as precice. I can't speak much to the other environments; however, the new Valley seemed reasonable, albeit hard as sin to control, and Rollercoaster was -far- too finicky feeling. Both I'm sure would be alright with practice, but overall they don't feel like unique or interesting iterations. I haven't played Stadium since TMN but it didn't feel great either. An interface designed for TVs. I'm sure I'd get used to it, but there's also a lot of work they could do to improve the readability of important elements (like checkpoint splits) The ""or simply generate random [tracks]"" makes tracks that don't really understand the mechanics of their environmentsThe Good Getting all four environments in one packages means hopefully Valley and Lagoon will see more multiplayer attention. Multiplayer really isn't that bad. I don't care how the servers are implemented because the to most players the functionality is exactly what you'd expect from TM2. Sparse at the moment, but that will change as people make and port tracks. The campaign mode feels pretty good. I just wanted to get into multiplayer, but I enjoyed my time with it.The Just Alright Excellent graphical fidelity, but the catch-22 of racing games is if you're playing well you don't have time to smell the roses. However, it doesn't sacrifice readability in most cases so it's not a downside by any means.VerdictThere's nothing in TMT that is done better than TM2 that justifies the price. Even people who don't already own TM2 might as well pick it up instead. Canyon and Stadium are all anyone plays to begin with and together they're $10 cheaper than TMT and you get a much better PC experience to boot.			",735,177,31,109,82,5,123

												Believe it or not, I'm not giving Turbo a negative review because HURR DURR MUH CUSTOM MODELS AND HORNSIt's nice to have a Trackmania game that has all of it's enviornments in one game, a Trackmania game that's not plagued with crap surrounding the screen in multiplayer...a Trackmania game that's purely about getting to the finish line in the fastest time. Turbo knows what it is, and it handles it's purpose as a time trial game exceedingly well. However, Trackmania Turbo DOES have enough flaws that makes it hard to recommend to veterans of the series.The biggest thing is the way the cars handle. The enviornment that feels the best is probably Canyon; the cars in Canyon feel a bit heavier than in TM2 but they still retain their fun drift physics. That part of the game feels great. It's just a little less responsive, unfortunately. Likewise, the Stadium cars feel heavier and less responsive as well, and considering how popular Stadium is I think they should have left it alone. In stark contrast, the Lagoon cars are twitchy as all hell and you can complete all of the White tracks without even touching the brakes once. The twitchiness would be ok, but the controller deadzone is incredibly small and there's no obvious way to change it. If you're trying to play Lagoon on keyboard, God help you. The worst of the bunch is Valley. Valley was unpopular in TM2, and it's still just as bad. Those cars have a stupidly wide turning radius until you gently tap the brakes, and then they suddenly have incredibly massive oversteer. And that's just on pavement; Valley cars control like pure crap on dirt, and there's a lot of dirt in Valley.This wouldn't be nearly as bad if you could tackle one enviornment at a time, but you cant. First you do the 10 White tracks in Canyon, which unlocks the first 10 White tracks in Valley, and so on. Doing tracks in one enviornment should unlock more tracks in the same enviornment; that way, the player has time to really hone their skills in one before moving on to another. In Turbo, as soon as you get used to one enviornment, you have to move to another. It's not done very well.Furthermore, this is a REALLY lazy port. I know this is mainly a console game that's also seeing a PC release, but this is really sad coming from a developer that created originally Trackmania as a PC exclusive series. The options that you can change are almost as limited as Dark Souls. Visually, the game's pretty attractive, but I wish there was more that I could control.Tl;dr, if you're a Trackmania veteran you're probably not going to like the changes that have been made to the existing enviornments. If you're a new player, you'll probably ge able to get used to it fairly quickly. Hopefully Nadeo turns their attention back to TM2 quickly, because I think I'm gonna pass on Turbo.

												I loved Trackmania for years and bought all the games and pre-purchased this game as soon as I heard of it, but I'm very likely to get a refund.- It requires UPlay. Wasn't sure if I already have a account tried 4 times to login, my IP got banned, had to restart my router to get access again. Password can only be 16 characters at most. What?- The Trackeditor is HORRIBLE, I always was a fan of the editor and how easy it was to use, but in this version it's complete garbage and not usable with mouse/keyboard, just forget it. You don't have the toolbar at the bottom but two wheels where you can select your parts with the mousewheel, also you have to place the block with the keyboard and are not able to move it with the mouse.- The graphics look worse then these from TMSunrise.- The whole game is not Trackmania anymore, I'm not sure what they aimed for, but they missed the classic Trackmania feeling by a landslide.And I say this as a person who absolutely loved Trackmania and was extremely hyped for this game.

												To get a more light side of the perspective on the game, I think it is very well constructed, there is so much map variety including some favourites from the game before. Yes, there is very little customization, just paints that I have yet to figure out how to fully work but I don't really care at all, I enjoy the game and the fact that I'm #5 in BC. Some slight hardware and software bugs like a constant drift when I had my Razer Orbweaver plugged in (which they're going to patch in the near future as of March 26) but everything works fine simply by unplugging a gamepad. If you're a true Trackmania® fan, you won't care about the ""no customization"" and will enjoy it for the amazing tracks and competitive community. Gotta go Fast.			",150,18,3,12,19,1,13

												Trackmania Turbo is very disappointing after playing the still excellent Trackmania 2 Stadium. Pretty much everyone loves that game, and I was heavily anticipating Turbo as a potential way to get new players into the weird and wonderful Trackmania. That might end up working out, but for the fans of the second installment, this is a wash. This is nothing more than a console port, but it also has the same ManiaPlanet quirks from Trackmania 2. It looks very pretty, but so did TM2S. No more horns, no dedicated servers (a REALLY big drag), no ghosts, only 2 camera angles, and annoying restart voices that removes the relaxing nature that TM2 had. The social aspect has been completely  neutered and while the racing is good, the little aspects from TM2S that are removed are sorely missing. I sincerely hope dedicated servers with more than 100 players gets patched in, because that's what the fans like about the series. Nadeo, please right this wrong and Make Trackmania Great Again.

												I enjoy this game, however I suffered too many crashed while streaming to feel the game deserve a perfect 10; The in track music does not bleed into the second and third attempts making me feel it does not earn a high 9. The game is very fun and true to the series but the inconsitant menu selection between tracks is just not fluid enough for me.I give them a 7.5 having expected more for the wait.[EDIT] I am still having consistant crashing from this game! Sometimes I can play one track, and have it crash when loading then next. I suspect this game does not do well with SSD's.I'm raiting this a 6 out of 10 after all my troubles and the clear lack of stability.((For the Dev's)) I'm running on an i7, 16 Gigs of ram, AMD r9 290x, with Multiple SSD's[EDIT number 2] Some people have asked me to tell more about the menu selection, and the one that really gets my goat is selecting next track - having the option to - Race Gold / Silver / Bronze and None... However I wanted to look at my unlocked instead... So I look at the menu, and their is no return to main screen, so i push B and nothing happens, I push Exacpe, even the backspace. Nothing.For me to go back to the main menu required me to select a race option, load the game, pause and return to home from THAT menu.I enjoy this game so much, but I hate the small stuff. I hope the developers listen.			",209,41,16,48,37,1,29

												In its current state, do not buy it, complete waste of money.  This game is a joke on pc, missing things so basic its baffling they didn't put them in for the pc version, they very clearly released the console version on pc without moddifying it in the slightest.  If you're on a computer with an integrated graphics card just give up on this entirely because it refuses to find your non-integrated card.  As a result I couldn't get above 30 fps during gameplay.  In the 100 minutes I spent rushing through the first 40 levels to try out all 4 environments to decide if I was going to refund it or not, The game stuttered constantly for 30 minutes for no reason as no settings had been changed, and the game crashed to desktop once on attempting to just access the customization options (which btw are absurdly limited now, thanks Ubisoft).  The in-game voices, although limited, are the most annoying voice clips I've heard, and thank god they at least put an option to turn off that voice, but it is impossible to turn off the 3,2,1,go counter if you don't like it. (I actually thought it was a good touch being a random language each time, but the option to turn it off should exist)The good:-Rollercoaster environment is mostly a good addition to the previous environments, at times it is extremely awkward (why is wood akin to ice?) but as a whole its fun-Its almost Trackmania?-Track editor still exists and by extension endless community tracksThe bad:-Performs like crap on integrated cards with no easy workaround-Uplay (I personally don't care but most people do)-PRIVATE SERVERS ARE GONE-LEADERBOARDS ARE GONE-2 players 1 car falls flat-This game was delayed and was still released in this state on pc3/10 play literally any other Trackmania game and you'll have more fun AND have customization			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is as bad as a console port can get which is a shame because the gameplay mechanics and UI are really on point. I like the aesthetic but the online community is completely dead (I would blame the terrible lobby/server browser for this as well as the horrible track maker). There are a load of stupid design flaws too, for example there is some really nice driving techno in the soundtrack but you'll only ever hear the intro to each song because by default when you restart a track it restarts the song too which is as ignorant a decision can get when making a trackmania game. Only buy this if it's on sale for very cheap because you'll only be playing this for the single player campaign mode. The lack of dedicated servers is a slap in the face for PC players. If they were implemented alongside a decent ranking system I think this could have been decent			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Disclaimer: This is mostly just a review for those who have played other TM titles. (And maybe like me have been scared by all the bad/ mixed reviews)Wow! What a wonderful game.I really don't know why all the bad reviews.This is the best trackmania I've played. For reference, the others I've played are United Forver and TM2 (all environments).I understand this game is going in a VERY SLIGHTLY different direction, but I like this direction.+ It cuts out the clutter of the other games UI.+ It adds more interesting decorations around the tracks. (Canyon in particular used to look slightly bland)+ It fixes what I didn't like about the TM2 Valley car handling.+ It adds an amazing new environment (possibly the best one yet - though the beach sections have tricky handling)+ It adds a new way to start tracks (dropping in from at helicopter at very high speed)+ It adds a random track generator (not always great, but most tracks are decent enough)+ The pacing of the campaign is ramped up. (The old games had too many very easy and very short tracks at the start.) I find many of the green tracks actually give a bit of a challenge.- I can see why modders would be disappointed. But, for me at least, the extra content I want most in these games is more tracks. And that is still available in this title.That is all.			",213,37,10,38,6,4,40

												I don´t know what all the hate is about.. It´s a really fun game with a lot of options of customizing your cars and creating your own tracks. Regarding what other people said in their reviews:- ""The game decides what you rate after a track"" = NOT TRUE    The game automatically picks ""Skip"" after any match, so you are still able to choose GOOD or BAD, but it does definitely              not pick one automatically.- ""U can´t customize your cars enough"" = NOT TRUE     There are so many customization options, such as stickers, material, flag, colour/pattern, BUT you cannot change the chassis of your vehicle. But that isn´t necessary in my opinion.- ""There are game pad input lags"" = FIXED with the last  update.    I can play it perfectly fine with my 360 controllerIt is a very good game overall. It is kinda different from the earlier TM games, but in a good way. The graphics and physics are awesome (even with older GPU & CPU). The soundtrack is very fitting and doesn´t get boring. 200 campaign tracks & different race modes keep you busy.			",17,3,2,3,2,0,0

												On average its not a bad game.... the re vamped zones have created a fairly decent new play area for newer players to have a good go with in terms of creating new tracks.However for vets its oh so very terrible in so so so many ways.nearly every environment is a rehash of the previous TMU environments, just a bit worse......granted i do prefer the ""canyon drift"" rather than the previous tmu comparrison, butthe newer ""rally"" type stage could not handle worse than it currently does.I mean in comparrison to the last attempt ""trackmania"" had at a ""rally"" stage.... this is just pathetic.There is zero control in loops, and even minor drifting basically kills the car dead around corners that are impossible.If they fixed the ""rally"" stage a little in terms of handling, and fixed the so called rollercoaster stage and made most of the section borderline playable to pc players and more.. then id would be fine.Thats not even mentioning every single corkscrew that they have in the damn game, i mean surely they should have learned after a couple of damn games how to build a looping track without causinga massiive bug which causes the player to reset their time........ basically fix the damn loop bugs and go back to bloody pc users rather than every platform, your messing up the core gamers that you attracted years ago, which your still lucky to have.......

												The gameplay is fantastic, but it's horribly broken.- Attempting to play with certain controllers plugged in will lead you car to accelerate non-stop, regardless of your input.- Quitting the game can sometimes break your mouse, making it impossible to click on anything on your desktop. Only fix is to restart.- Playing with a controller will have it randomly disconnect and not connect back up.- I'm not even sure how you go about sharing user-made tracks.I can deal with the lack of customisation. I couldn't care less what my car looks like. You can get the classic track editor in-game very easily and it works as good as it always has.

												Yes, this is not the competitive and community sided classic PC TM. But the game itself is awesome, with a lot of improvements that gives hope for the future of maniaplanet. Keep in mind that those who rage are generally the people who stuck on stadium because they discovered it as a F2P, and they are afraid for any change that can happen.Since TM1 there always have been people saying that TM was dead at every moment the devs were trying something different. The story is repeating but I'm glad Nadeo is still here, giving a well optimized game, opened to console players, but not casual at all, the essence of TM is still here and I freaking love it.

There is one 3rd person distance, and it feels like when you go off jumps or down hill that you can't see the road in front of you.- Of the first 6 tracks in Stadium, 5 of them are from previous trackmania versions.  I want new content.  The car drives the same, so new tracks!Lesser complaints:- Quite flashy.  The countdown and ""GO!!"" are huge and block the view of the first 2 seconds of driving.- Menus are a little ugly, but that's personal preference.I'm disappointed in this release.

												The gameplay for this game is amazing. The controls are very smooth and fluid and the graphics just blow me away. However, as a big fan of being able to create my own tracks, I must say that i am completely infuriated. The game just before this is the series had a great level design, so why not just keep that? The trackbuilder tool in this game is obviously meant to be used with a gamepad. That, of course would not be terrible in and of itself unless you take into account that the controls are absolutely abysmal. You are forced to go back and forth from using just the mouse to just the keyboard over and over, and the entire thing has a lack luster ""tutorial,"" that tells you just about nothing. I tried my best to have any kind of enjoyment when using the trackbuilder tool but there was just no way. The track builder tool is a HUGE part of this game and is a big attraction for many people, especially on PC where customization is your best friend, and anyone who is looking forwards to this game for that, is going to be completely heartbroken. It honestly feels like there was no effort put into making the trackbuilder controls PC friendly at all.			",15,1,3,3,0,0,0

												Trackmania has had a bit of a troubled past. Their first major hit 'Trackmania Nations' was free to play, and played by hundreds of thousands of people simultaneously worldwide. A combination of Trackmania 2 being divided by gameplay type (canyon, valley, stadium) and the games no longer being free to play started to harm the games reputation - the playerbase was dwindling, as fans were so divided amongst several versions of the game, they all appeared to be dead. Trackmania Turbo aims to fix that.First and foremost, this game has uPlay and requires a separate account. You can't escape this, even the console version asks you to register and use an account separate from your PSN/XBL ID. It's not really worth complaining about in this context as equal effort is required no matter your platform of choice.As far as PC options go, it's barebones and actually quite bad in a few instances. True fullscreen mode is hit or miss; enabling it on my PC shows the interface at the correct aspect ratio, but 3d elements of the game are rendered in 4:3 then stretched to 16:9, which looks awful, as are the the uplay and steam overlays. Getting a proper 16:9 ratio required that I played the game in borderless window mode. There are no options to change your controller bindings, and detection of xinput pads can be spotty, too - my Xbox 360 controller is detected by the game, but actually operates in Dinput mode, which means only the right or left trigger can be active at any given time. They are detected as the same axis. For drifting and braking, this requires me to rely on tapping 'A' to initiate a drift, and I must fully release the right trigger to brake at all. Graphics options are equally barebone, and setting the water to 'highest' actually causes graphical defects.However, these are elements that can be worked around - using a different controller (such as a DS4 or Xbox One controller) properly detects and uses Xinput functionality, allowing you to hold the right trigger to accelerate and tap the left trigger to initiate a drift just like you can on the consoles. Once you're logged into uPlay, you can set it to remember your credentials and you'll never have to think about it again. Playing in borderless window mode is indistinguishable from fullscreen mode and as an added bonus, eliminates screen tearing without having to enable vsync, plus you can alt tab quickly from the game. Graphically speaking, the game is on par with the console versions even at the medium settings, and seems to be optimized well - my modest rig can easily run the game at 60+fps. Patches are reportedly on the way to fix issues with controllers.I won't get too in-depth on how this game compares to previous titles, because frankly, as Nations went on, the dedicated servers and level of customization available to players converted the interface into a huge mess, and the maps you could race on became less fun to a casual player over time, as the diehard fans demanded more difficult, puzzle-like maps to play on.What you get here is a 200 map-strong campaign, spread across 4 unique playstyles. Each car handles very differently, and for the first time in the series, each mode is truly united - the interface seamlessly transitions you from environment to environment, because they are all actually part of a single game, an improvement over previous entries in the series. You can join a server that runs maps from multiple environments, also a first for the series. The game is very fast paced and has many arcade qualities to it. One perk of playing on PC is dramatically improved loading times - my time on the beta and later on, the demo for the PS4, had me waiting upwards of 25 seconds to load into a new map. Installing this game to an SSD on my PC has reduced that time to a mere 7 seconds, and i'm operating on a lower end SSD, too. The controls are responsive, and there's no stuttering or wait times to restart the entire map or from your previous checkpoint. There are per-map and overall rankings divided into multiple sections, allowing you to see how you measure up to the world, your country, and even down to the state level. Aiming for gold is just the beginning - the game makes it very clear to you how you measure up, and the small nature of each track encourages you to keep trying until you achieve trackmaster (a hidden ranking beyond gold) or become one of the best players in your region.Taking the game online allows you to filter servers down to something you can enjoy, and you race against real-time ghosts of up to 99 others on the server. It feels good to know exactly how you stack up against others not only on a world/country/state level, but how you fare against others in a more intimate, competitive environment that demands consistently good performance out of you. It's nice to be able to witness how others take on the course, too. A current problem lies in how the servers are handled, though - since they're hosted by the developers, there's currently no easy way for you to make a track and share it with others. Reportedly, they're working on a fix for this, but in the mean time, you still have 200 official maps to occupy yourself with.I personally believe the game is very fun, and lives up to the Trackmania name. This game represents the best opportunity for the entire community to come together and settle on a single game. Many of the complaints you'll see in the other reviews are valid, but overblown. The worst problems very quickly move out of your way and aren't really a issue anymore, beyond the games initial setup.			",148,22,4,8,9,1,9

												We've been waiting for that game nearly one year, and at the end, I've never been so disappointed about a game.I'm not going to explain every single details why this game isn't even the half of what previous games have been. Many players have been explaining why very well.Gameplay is still fun and challenging, the game is still beautiful and they finally got ride of that annoying official mode for the solo mode. But even with that, this game is empty. I know that functions which are not available on console have been deleted, but is that a reason for ghost which cannot be hidden ? Is that a reason for the save of replays to be so annoying to use ? Is that a reason for the multiplayer to be so lame ? Is that a reason to not have dedicated servers (so that competition cannot go on) ?Stadium isn't my favorite environement, and sadly, it's the only environment still living. When TrackMania Turbo has been announced, I was hoping that it would revive environments like Canyon or Valley. I was hoping that the slowly dying community would grow back again. But a game like is way too limited to allow that to happen.I have been playing many hours on previous games, and I'm just sad to see the direction that Trackmania has taken, what have been doing the game's strength is now disappearing. For whoever have been playing and loving the TrackMania series, I won't recommend the game.Because it's not, and it will never be the TrackMania we used to know.			",16,2,5,6,1,0,1

												This is probably the best arcade PC racing game right now. DEFINITELY buy it over TrackMania 2. It may be a bit more console-ified, but if anything it needed it. In TrackMania 2 there were stupid little ""dedimania"" things all over the screen in multiplayer, which were most useless. Dedimania had things like server records, donation links and more. While this may have been helpful to a hardcore player who came back to the server frequently, it only served as a huge distraction for anyone else just casually looking to jump into an online match. Also, this edition doesn't have you pay out money for each individual section of the game (a decision which has almost killed TrackMania to this day). For $40.00, TrackMania Turbo gives you: Four different environments each with a distinct vehicle to drive, tools to create an almost infinite amount of different tracks to race on, a large single player campaign with 50 challenges for each environment, online multiplayer with an abiet small but unified community, a car customizer inferface (with different decals and color options to choose) a replay editor. The menus, interface and level editors are also optimized for controller use (should you want to play on TV or not switch between mouse and controller.For $50, TrackMania 2 gives you: three environments each with the same vehicles to drive as their Turbo counterparts, (with different models), tools to create a nearly infinite amount of different tracks to race on, three medium single player campaigns, one for each environment (containing around 80 per environment), car painter with tools to create a completely unique look for the car you choose, tools to import other models for use as cars, controls not optimized for controller (they can be used, but the game doesn't seem to accept analog acceleration options), online multiplayer with very small, divided communities (good matches can be very difficult to find), and dedimania *cringe*.Do what you want with your money. I still find that TrackMania Turbo's improved controls, aesthetic, more expansive content and more active community produces a much more well made racing game.			",84,13,13,2,5,0,3

												Don't get me wrong. It's fun, and pretty simple to pick-up and play. Those are pretty big pluses. I just wish it didn't come with so many downsides.For one thing, the idea of truly custom skins seems to be non-existent in this game. Okay, you can make some level of custom skins, but that's pretty much it, you use templates to make something, but nothing like the level of creativity found in the Forever games, or even Trackmania 2.Same thing with the tracks. It seems to default to a console-based layout, which seems to show that it's really just a console port, without any considerations for anyone who's played the previous Trackmania games. You could even create custom signs to use in tracks as far back as Trackmania Nations ESWC, you can't in this, which is a shame.And that's not including the whole uplay thing. Some might mind it, others might not.Costing more than Trackmania United, it seems like a major step backwards, towards the original Trackmania game, back in 2003. I expected a newer game to have more customisation than this.If you're looking for a good Trackmania game, go for either of the Forever games (Nations or United) or even Trackmania 2. If you still want to get this, by all means do, but just know what you're getting into.			",13,2,8,4,5,0,5

												Okay people, I've had eleven minutes - ELEVEN - in this game and already I'm noticing Ubisoft's terrible PC rap sheet. I can't switch smoothly from a controller to a mouse and keyboard, the mouse seems to just stop working sometimes, and moreover, when I went in and tried to fiddle with the track editor, the menu started freaking out. I unplugged my controller, expecting it to be the cause, but that didn't do anything, do I just quit the game altogether. Lo and behold, when I got back to windows, MY MOUSE LITERALLY WOULD NOT FUNCTION. All I got was a double-beep when I clicked, and no indication when I rolled over menus and things. I'm gonna keep this, because I'm a masochist and I like Trackmania and the arcadey style, but KEEP AWAY UNTIL THE BUGS ARE IRONED OUT. KNOWING UBISOFT THIS WILL TAKE A COUPLE MONTHS.22/2/17 update: I haven't gotten any updates for this game in a long time. That's not a good sign. Ten bucks says these guys abandoned the game and there's no official support anymore. I haven't checked the forums yet because these people should be telling us what they're doing in the News section... y'know, like a smart company? Transparency, people! It's a consumer-friendly practice!Oh, and... I heard we were supposed to get updates with all the new blocks from this game in the original three TM2 games. Hasn't happened yet, and I doubt it ever will. Ubisoft has eaten Nadeo.			",90,3,9,5,9,0,9

Pros:+Finally a jumping point into the series; doesn't feel as intimating as starting DOTA.+Steam controller bindings enable touch sensitive directional pad steering / swappable setups for each location.+Track builder supports both snap to grid and free placement (can create segmented track pieces).Cons:-Steam controller inputs during loading screens tend to crash the game at the moment.-Walled off garden compared to the rest of the PC community (ticking time bomb until servers are unplugged).-You'll want to bang your head on the keyboard at first when figuring out the few non-standard key icons in the track builder.Overall: (from an unwashed new comer)Feels like a good stepping stone into the complicated / bizarre Trackmania world (without a lot of the TM unspoken social norms).  The Uplay implementation is fairly unobtrusive once you log in, though not ideal.  This should bridge the gap for newcomers until Trackmania 2 receives its promised feature update.   The community split / lack of server support is upsetting but hopefully it will attract more players (like me) into trying the series.			",86,5,3,22,6,0,16

												Let's get this out of the way: Yes, it uses Uplay, yes some of the social features are gimped as a result, and yes, it's less mod-friendly. Now that we've covered that, this is the best Trackmania since United. It's packs four different environments in one release, and they're some of the series' best yet, playing toward the wild and extreme stunts. They're crazy fun, and there are some interesting new modes, split-screen support, and a ton of levels. The level editor is back, with a choice of two interfaces, and it's easy to make and share levels, like it should be. The presentation and interface is also much improved over the clunky old menus of past Trackmanias. So if you're a PC gaming purist offended at any slight compromise in a multiplatform release, well... you know what you're getting into. But if you're more concerned with gameplay, content, and the things that really make this series fun, you'll find a lot to love.			",201,78,10,14,8,4,24

												I feel mixed about this game. In a nutshell, I like the campaign, but hate everthing else in the game.The campaign is a thrilling action-packed experience where you have to have really fast reaction times to avoid crashing the car. I believe that the campaign fulfills the promise of the game's trailer by looking graphically impressive and playing relatively smoothly with devices that approach the minimum system requirements (basically, the game was well optimized for preformance). There are lots of great tracks created by the development team.On the other hand, the track editor is something that I would not even touch if I were you. When I went to start it up (about 1 out of 3 times), my whole computer locked up. I could not open Windows Task Manager (I'm running Windows 7) to end the application like I would normally; therefore, I had to hardboot the computer every time it locked up.Also, even the advanced track editor is extremely restrictive. I can only place 172 blocks down on the map and the editor for it is really clunky and hard to use in comparison to other Trackmania games.			",12,7,4,4,1,0,1

												Most of the salt torwards this game is because they tried to make it better. No name changes, no car horns, no custom models. They did this to clean up the game, not make it more boring, and people don't seem to realize that too much. I like this game, personally. It feels like trackmania. It looks like it. The tracks want to devour your soul like the old games. Trackmania is the one game series that brings true frustration into my life when it comes to gaming and I commend it for that.Pros: +4 worlds, 200 tracks+Decent variety in tracks, environments are different enough to be distinct+Despite no model changes, lots of paints and you unlock more for being better+People are still having custom names somehow, so I don't see the problem+Very pretty graphics.Cons:-My Nvidia Shield controller isn't compatible. Kind of a disappointment.-Because of this, tracks are HARD. I'm stuck on the black series because I can't perfectly molest my keyboard to do the track like if I had a controller.-Track builder is kind of complicated. It always has been to me though because I'm an idiot. :^)-Despite a lot of patterns for cars, there's still not too many. It's about 10 predetermined patterns recolored in different ways. Decals and numbers still have a lot of variety.My conclusion: I give this game an 8/10. It's completely in the spirit of Trackmania, but it's a bit harder on keyboard than the old ones.

												I had my doubts about TM Turbo when I found out it was going to be on uPlay, and I even decided against buying into the game because of it. However I bit the bullet and decided I would overlook uPlay because I'm a huge long term TrackMania fan and I'd hate myself if I didn't atleast give it a fair chance, and am I glad I did. As Turbo did not disapoint.PositivesIf you have a love for the TrackMania series then you will feel right at home playing turbo, as essentially it is just the whole series bundled into one TrackMania with the addition of rollercoaster environment.Excellent music, I don't usually use in-game music for any game however the flow of the music and choice of music fits perfectly into the game.Double Driver mode is a whole lot of fun if you have a buddy to do it with, and is a very intresting twist on the whole game and opens up a whole new world of entertainment value for Turbo from previous Trackmania Titles.Keeps with the origional Trackmania track creator and add a few extra features and functionality to the Track Builder such as a random track, which will literally randomly put pieces together to form a functional track, to which you can tweak. This is mostly a gimmick to those confertable with Track building however it will allow much easier entry into the Track building side of things. As some people find it easier to tweak and add than the build from scratch.NegativesRequires uplay to play. though I haven't personally ran into an issue with uplay and Trackmania Turbo, uplay is infamous for causing lots of problems when trying to access games, activate games, log in, always being online etc. So depending how strongly you hate uplay this may be a turn off.The customizability of cars was changed from freepaining your car in an MS paint style to selecting presets for different aspects, changing material, paint job, numbers, details and flags. This could be seen as a positive point for some people, however for me I liked the MS paint style of painting cars, as it mean for more unique and personal paintjobs. SummaryIf you're a fan of TM Canyon, TM Valley and TM Stadium then TM Turbo is a must have and a steal for value as you essentially get TM Canyon, TM Valley, TM Stadium and newly added TM Lagoon, with new tracks to run and new records to smash.

												I have very mixed feelings about this.I did some reading of reviews. I did my own testing. Both solo, multiplayer (very little) and local multi with friends.Like many I played since the very first TM, and the Turbo was an early purchase because i knew it would be fun and refreshing.First of all, please stop with these ""1hour played"" and ""i want a refund"". The reasons given are not important enough, it's all tiny ones that'll be fix soon. It's been the same people making the game since the very first, and i have hope they will listen to us and provide fixes and solutions.I've been reading a lot of complains about controls, i had none. But i understand it can be frustrating not to be able to customize them.Horn? I didn't notice, but indeed it should be an easy fix.Two cameras ? Yeah... that could be improved as well!!All these things are very minors though, and could be fixed in one single patch.Quick note about local multiplayer. Because from the video i had hope of having a new micro machine type of game... no it's not. It's quickly messy, and if a players skill are too different, the game won't be fun anymore.Unlike the solo campaign, you can't have any sort of continuity in the game such as ""next track"", and you have each time to exit and select a new track... simple stuff to fix !!The two players in one car is original and fun.But afterall, we ended up playing hot seat. One after the other to have the whole screen for ourselves.Something else now that i haven't been reading anywhere, is the gameplay itself.We now have 4 environnements to play with, each with different cars and roads and grips. They are fun to drive, and the small differences between them makes it interesting.But.To be honest, they all pretty much very similar and come to handling high speed. There is no more of that technique you could find in the first one, with the snow level for example or the mediterranean one; where the challenge wasn't so much the speed and fast tracks but more towards the specificity of how the car was behaving.And now i feel like all the different cars have come to the same thing: too much speed.Maybe it's what made the game famous and fun, but i think they should have put a slower one in the middle to have some variations in gameplay, and more challenges for gamers. See my picture profile ? I need glasses and i'm getting too old for such speed!Ah anyway, in summary:PROS:- Lot of content in Solo- Inifinite content thanks to editor- multiplayer looks stable- interface is simple and nice to use- nice to have split screen- funny and interesting two drivers seat- sound, atmosphere & graphicsCONS:- lack of variations in gameplay between cars. They're fun to drive, but repetitive- messy one-screen mode micromachine-like- local multi lacking of queue/playlist option- No horn they said- uplay... :( (although it's fairly straight forward and not annoying too much)If they'd fix all the little annoyance, the game would be perfectly recommendable.In any case, i'll keep playing and beat times against friends, and see how bad i am in my hometown ranking :)Have a good one			",51,9,6,3,7,0,5

												High-speed, crazy racing that takes an incredible amount of skill, yet is fun enough to make you replay a single track 20 times without a second thought. The multiplayer is awesome; 100 cars on a single track (but they don't knock you off because you can't collide, thankfully). The multiplayer is bigger than Battlefield, in a way! This game is awesome, and there are too few games like it. It's the perfect complement to Dirt Rally - two highly challenging racing games that are almost completely opposite in the ""realisitic"" factor.I've played Trackmania since the first game off and on (I'm not a hardcore fan), and I personally think this is the best one yet, and really one of my favorite racing games I've played in a long time (along with Dirt Rally).

												The graphics and three of the environments have already been established by previous TM games, so i won't touch on those. So i'll just dabble into a few things that put me off:First of all, the customization. TM is incredibly famous for the ability to choose out of hundreds of community-created models and skins for your vehicles, as well as giving you the reins to make your own. This game... not so much. While i think that the new cars for the older environments look really nice, there's little to their customization as all you're offered are rather basic patterns with different palettes unlocked by random goals: even the ability to pick your own colors for these patterns would've been much much better. The unlockable customizations don't really have anything to do with their unlocking demands, so a better idea would've been just to give them all right away and not make them some illusion of a reward for X gold medals.Second, music. The previous TM games offered 1-3 tracks per environment and i'm quite sure Sunrise was the only one to use licensed (if obscure, though fitting) music. This game has an entire licensed soundtrack, which is something else. Though i have never seen any of these names, not even the Monstercat ones i'd expect to recognize. And while i obviously can't speak for everyone when i say i don't like the music, i think i can rather objectively say that any of it doesn't fit the game at all. Absolutely none of the songs even remotely fit Trackmania as it is. Moreover, the music changes every single time you respawn, which if you've ever played a TM game you know that it will happen over and over again, making the music more annoying than the worst tracks. My advice, blacklist every song and play your own.But not so bad that there's nothing good. I enjoy the new take on things such as the scenery props and the HUD. The game feels a lot like a singleplayer game, like it'd have cutscenes or maybe even a plot. I think the idea of Trackmania as an established, international spectator sport comes through nicely. Sadly, the poorness of customization and trackbuilding (while i'm not a trackbuilder myself, i've yet to hear people actually like it), which are big cornerstones of TM as we know it, prevent me from recommending the game. Maybe if you've never played a TM game, this could be something to start off from, and if you like it you can perhaps branch to the actual TM games and expect a more down-to-earth approach, so to say. Then again, you could just try TM Nations instead which would save you 40 bucks whether you liked it or not. But as a longstanding fan of the TM series, Turbo feels almost like a sub-par spinoff. Though it is nice that console players get a taste of TM as well.			",62,1,11,3,3,1,0

												OK, first of all, allot of people are whining about the online aspect of this game. GEUSS WHAT. its still a good game. In fact, this particular trackmania is as fun to me as Trackmania Sunrise (My favorite one). The fact that your lap time is instantly put up and compared to other times. And when you go through a track again and again until you finally make it to #1 track time. I have played every single Trackmania game since the first game. And this one is as close to the original formula of the first one as any of the others (except Sunrise of course). The tracks are awesome, they require skill, and the track creator is better than ever, and sharing tracks is an easy and seamless ordeal. I am dissapointed that this game isnt doing as well as it should be. Trackmania has always been a PC title. And this latest game is one I play allot, and because of all the multiplayer tracks and ENTIRE MULTIPLAYER TRACK LIST!!!!!. I have many more hours of gameplay to come. I highly recommend this game, dont let the other reviews taint your opinion of this game, Trackmania2 Canyon and whatever was good, but this is closer to home for me. PLEASE consider this game. Its a good one :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I may be not a good TM player, but at least, all the previous environment of TM were playable and fun.On this new TM, I have so much trouble with the Lagoon and Valley. Your car become and instant soapbox and I still haven't understood how to stabilize it. I have lost patience and stopped playing since you are FORCED to go through each environment to unlock the next track serie (meaning if you only like stadium serie, you still have to complete the 30 other tracks to unlock the new stadium serie). This is a very odd choice from Nadeo.I still miss platform and puzzle mods, gone since TMNU which is still my favourite game of the serie so far.			",288,68,13,23,24,4,36

												I dont know if this problem is just me, but my time with this game was a mess..to start it took me a full day and many reinstalls to get the game to actually start up then i was dissapointed by the lack of surround support and to change the options, I have to quit the game then launch the config. After that, it was another attempt to get the game to launch without crashing.Next, when I finally got the game to launch with the correct resolution I turned on my xbox one controller and found that the support for the controller was just terrible. I was turning to the left and accelerating without pushing any buttons. I tried many controllers like a steam controller and encountered the same issues.Im extremely dissapointed in this game and i quickly requested a refund.DONT BUY THIS GAME			",155,18,17,10,29,2,6

												Simplicity is all what Trackmania is about, there are only 4 controls. You drive, brake, go left or go right. But that doesn't mean the  game is as easy as it sounds...The goal is all about time, do everything you can to get the best time. You have to keep trying to improve by just 0.01 seconds, doing everything you can. Stay as close as you can to the edge, land jumps with excellent precision, control speed so you don't go too fast but not too slow. If you ever fail, start over, because you want that Gold medal so bad don'tcha?Now for comparision between the other Trackmanias: I've been playing Trackmania since Sunrise, and I will admit this one is not that bad as everyone says. It has very much improved UI, better music and Rollecoaster tracks! It has some very cool ""arcade"" modes where you can use powerups and all that stuff, so it's excellent for parties. The cons of the game are maximum of 100 players per server, limited car customization and of course UPlay.Replay Editor and the Classic Trackeditor do still exist, just might be a bit hard to find.In conclusion I love this game franchise and I think Turbo is alot of fun to play.Recommended to everyone that hasn't played any of the previous ones.

												This game is mechanically amazing. Its Trackmania and its damn good. Lagoon Rollercoaster is a great new addition, and the colors that were lost when Trackmania made the jump from Nations to Trackmania 2 are back in full force.I hated the UI in Trackmania 2 and the lack of colors was straining on the eyes for long play sessions. Trackmania Turbo cleaned up everything that was annoying about Trackmania 2, and stripped the game down to its core.Yeah you can't customize things as much as in the last few games but that never mattered to me. Just give me fun tracks and tight controls. That's the only thing that has ever mattered in Trackmania, and Turbo freaking nails it. Double Driver alone would be good enough for multiplayer, but this game has a bunch of fun modes and SPLIT-SCREEN!10/10 what an amazing experience.			",81,5,7,4,5,0,4

												Basically, it's Trackmania 2 ported to consoles, ported to PC.If you ever liked the customizability of previous installments in the series, or the convenience of the track editor, just buy TrackMania 2 instead.After trying to get accustomed to the track editor for 30 minutes, I gave up, because I'd be faster creating a track if I had to place each block by writing the code for it in assembly.Also, the random track generator is absolutely useless. Its results suck, and it doesn't seem to have any intelligent design programmed in at all.The one positive thing I can say is that the UI looks gorgeous. Should you buy this game though? No.EDIT: I found out the classic track editor is in the game, just a bit hidden. By moving the cursor to the top-right in the editor you can switch - I'm not sure why they wouldn't just make it the default, or at least let you choose it in the menu where you choose which editor you want.This brings every trackbuilder's experience with this game up by a lot, given how much more convenient it is to use. However, you will still be underwhelmed with the lack of customizability if you've been used to older TM games, so I still recommend waiting for Lagoon to be released on TM2 over getting this game.

												I've been a long time player of Trackmania Nations Forever, and I was very excited when Trackmania Turbo was announced. As a more casual player, I can almost say I've built a computer capable of more than casual gaming for a big part for this game. It seemed so cool!But, well, no.First of all, this UPlay thing where you must log in with a 1 time password at every first launch of the game per day is a real pain.Then, the cars. I  don't care about importing new cars or whatnot customization. I just want them to be drivable. The Stadium car in TNF was pretty well balanced and fun to drive. You were battling with the track, not with the car. In Trackmania Turbo, the car is your worst enemy, with 2 awful examples in Lagoon and Valley. Those things are just impossible to drive. It's pretty obvious when you look online: the very, very large majority of the games is Canyon only!And, finishing with the multiplayer. For a game which is multiplayer, it's very, very empty. This morning we were only 8 (!!!) online players. What is happening there?Well, I know what's happening, this game is a disappointment. Technically it looks very good and is not even power hungry, but it's just not fun. Which is the core of Trackmania.			",8,0,4,0,0,0,0

What it has over it's older predecessor, TM 2, is that they've finally merged all of their ""environments"" into one game, which is what they should've done with TM 2. The lack of dedicated servers, however, is a MAJOR step down. They could add enough features to their multiplayer servers to fix this, but those features aren't available on launch.

												Trackmania has changed a lot.. The editor is impossible to use, and the gameplay is just too hard. The game has changed to an average 20 years old to a baby game. I've had all Trackmania Original, Sunrise, United, United Forever, Nation, Nation Forever, 2 Stadium, 2 Canyon, Shootmania 2 Valleys and not this. What i've recently noticed is the culture in the cars and map building. Now, It's a whole lot different.It still got some few bugs in itself but that's explainable (Ubisoft) and singleplayer is way to easy. There is so much colors that it is impossible to navigate. I haven't tested all the cars yet, but I can tell that this needs some update (PC Fix and more compatible to PC).I can understand the bugs because of the transfer from Xbox to PC. Compared to all the other games, I'll say this is too colorful, too destracting, bad stearing, a few bugs and has become a babygame.I like the new Lagoon, the music and the counter at the beginning: ""drei, zwei, eins, GO!"" haha			",37,2,5,3,2,0,2

												TLDR: If Trackmania is not the most important game of your life, this game is perfectly fine for you. If you care about nothing as much as Trackmania, stick with Trackmania 2.I'm gonna take a stand for Trackmania Turbo, Nadeo and Ubisoft, even if that's a very unpopular thing to do.Trackmania Turbo is a beautiful, very polished game with 4 environments and a very capable multiplayer. It's a game that most certainly would not have been made - at least in this fidelity - if it wouldnt cater to a wider audience (I'm speaking of consoles). Previously, you paid 50€ for 3 environments, now you pay 40€ for 4. Good deal right there. This issue many people seem to have is that you cant mod this game to your hearts content, whereas this was possible in all previous iterations. To want to mod all this stuff - cars, server, music etc - is of course a valid point. For some. Because i dont. I dont care about what my care looks like, they all drive the same anyway. I dont want my UI cluttered with some BS plugin someone thinks is funny or handy or whatever. The game's UI tells me everything I need to know. And for gods sake, I dont want some 14 year olds who spend their allowance on server hosting to dictate what music I listen to while playing. Because I've yet to listen to a decent song being played on any server in Trackmania 2. So if you're not completely crazy about Trackmania, you just like playing it, this is the best Trackmania yet. If you are, you better stick to Trackmania 2.			",182,24,8,22,29,4,29

												I have all three of the other TrackMania games; Stadium, Valley and Canyon. I love to create tracks that are both fun and enjoyable. Canyon is my favorite. So I am VERY disappointed in the 'new' track creator tools. OMG are they so NOT user friendly!!! Why would you (TM) make such a radical change from the well tested and simple to use tools of TM Canyon, TM Stadium, and TM Valley?? AND, now I can't put any piece I want anywhere on the map until a 'checkpoint' is placed first!?!? What The Hell!? Think seriously about going back to the track creator tools of your franchise and just update them with the new track parts.Whoever designed the 'beach track', should be dragged out into the street and shot! What a absolultely horrible design, feel and play! Great graphics. It feels like i'm at the beach. But from the grip of the car to the bulls**t sides of the track to the f**ked up water on part of the track, makes it nothing more than a rage inducing, blood pressure medication taking, horror show.I like the magnetic track and the new racer that goes with it.One other item that I REALLY, REALLY want you to update the program with... a way to change the voice that counts down the 3, 2, 1, GO! I understand that it's a 'National Game' but I truely do not want to hear every other nationality do this count down 90% more often than my own. I'm not kidding with that percentage either. I hear English only once in 30 or so races. Pisses me off more than makes me admire the Political Correctness.AND, now that I think about it, why is the game music all or nothing?! Why is there no volume control? As anyone knows, there should be a volume control on how loud the music is. Because just turning down my speaker volume just reduces ALL volume which is pointless as I would like to hear the car engine and the squeal of tires.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Although it is missing some settings and features that the previous installments had it is still a pretty solid game. If you own or liked the previous Trackmania games then you will for sure enjoy this one and spend hours trying to improve times. At its current price I would say it is asking a bit much. If you pick it up in a steam sale you won’t regret buying it. 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played the older Trackmania titles for thousands of hours. This game however lacks all the important bits that made TM so addictive. Without leader boards, ingame local and global record lists and server communities to stick to this game feels utterly shallow and pointless. And it's such a waste because the game looks good and runs smooth but that's the only positives.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Here's what's different from the previous installments:Severe lack of graphic settings Your options: okay, better, and bestStripped car customization Say goodbye to detailed paintjobs, custom models, and horns I'd also like to note that you must now unlock preplaced, premade decales and paintjobsNo user dedicated servers This means no custom content most trackmania fans are use to in multiplayer It's also worth noting that server leaderboards aren't presentConsole oriented track editor You will not be able to insert custom music, textures, or UIs It's currently not possible to create ghost demos to help players that don't quite understand how to beat your trackReplay editor is gone Those who enjoyed making cinematic recaps of their blazing fast times and their flashy stunts will find this upsettingFor those with previous TrackMania experience I recommend sticking with, or going with, TrackMania 2 as the missing features above are in it.Those new to trackmania will find this installment exceptionally fun, but do understand that TrackMania's multiplayer community revolved around custom content on top of the gameplay.

												A worthy follow-up of a great franchise!I love the colors, love the arcade-style, love the local multiplayer, hell, I love just about everything that there is to love about Trackmania Turbo! I have been a fan since the first game, and while the second was lacking a lot in my opinion, Turbo sets it straight by listening to the complaints and giving the people what they wanted: various environments, new mechanics, smooth gameplay, four distinct styles of play, but also has added some pretty nifty new features. Many of them involving local multiplayer, splitscreen, coop and more!I also love how the shift went from the competitive players to the more casual players, and I may be alone in this, but it's my opinion. The HUD looks clean, straightforward compared to previous TM games, and I love the pinging option! I am a social player myself, so being able to welcome a new player without needing to stop or restart my race is pretty fun. Just one hit of a button, and I have sent a simple ""Hi!"" to the newcomer.Now, there are some downsides.The first and most noticable being the trackbuilder on PC. For consoles, it looks pretty neat, but also something to get used to. Luckily, there's an option to revert to the old editor for PC. Sadly enough, it's hidden in the top bar, and only when you're editing, so many players will simply not even see it.Then there's the lack of customization. Now, I do agree that custom models aren't necessary, but the only customization that we have right now are unlockable skins, decals and more. I'd love to have the ability to paint your car the way you like it. With brushes, stickers and whatnot.The final bit, which is only a minor annoyance, is that when water reflections are on high, the water shows black squares when viewed from afar. But since it doesn't really affect anything else than graphics, I can let it slip.Overall, a great game. Nothing more to say about it!			",73,13,7,10,15,1,6

												Visuals: this game is art. Everything flashes and has this colorful arcade feel that fits the game's style perfectly. Technically, graphics quality is the same from Trackmania 2. But visuals are better because of a nicer artistic direction.Audio: There's more than 40 tracks by EDM producers in the game. If you like house you're gonna love this. During races, the music is dynamically mixed according to your speed. This makes you get pumped in high speed tracks, but isn't perfect, especially in tracks where you speed up and down constantly. Sound FX are vastly improved from the previous games, including turbo sounds, engine sounds, ambient and crashing sounds. There's also an announcer, which you may like or not, but you can turn off anyway.Gameplay: In comparison to previous Trackmania - The multiplayer game is no longer a spreadsheet simulator. ""Hardcore fans"" dislike it. I like it. Some unimportant customization is gone. The important, like replay editing, track building and custom games, are still here. Completely custom servers are going to be added in the next patch. But the racing, which is what actually is the core of Trackmania, remains the same from previous games. Amazing sense of speed, completely crazy tracks and great controls. Gameplay is based on time trials and shaving off precious centiseconds to get the best time. However, Trackmania isn't for you if you want a game with car-to-car collisions or simulation.Interface/Customization: Menus are stylish, but some settings are hidden in a bar that appears only when you hover your mouse on the top of the screen. And these settings are important. There's sliders for music/sound FX volume, graphics settings, a replay editor, the classic track editor and control configuration hidden there. A lot of people are missing this and giving the game bad ratings.Car painting has been simplified from the previous games. Instead of painting your own car, you unlock skins and pre-placed stickers for cars. It adds a sense of progression, but it would be nice if you could paint manually too. Maybe in an update?HUD could be better. Since it was made with consoles in mind the elements are bigger than they need to be and end up being distracting (especially in multiplayer). However, this should be the easiest thing to fix with a patch.I have been playing Trackmania since United. For me, this one is great, maybe even the best.			",129,24,3,8,3,1,6

												My favorite Trackmania already. Stripped down from the too many customization options that were mostly in my way, this one focuses on making racing perfect.Stadium is still good old Stadium.Canyon feels and looks a little bit better.Valley has been drastically improved with wider blocks which make smoother tracks.Lagoon is a bit of a mix of Island and Bay, with a hint of F-Zero high speed sharp reflexes at times. It is amazingly fun.And Trackmania is finally properly enjoyable with real friends with loads of local multiplayer modes. Monoscreen is hilarious, and it has collisions between cars!They also did a lot of effort on the soundtrack and visual effects to improve the game feel drastically, drifting, turbo's, jump are all felt with much more strength.The most pleasant, smoothest, best looking, best feeling Trackmania experience for me.

												This is a pretty good console rendition of Trackmania. It's all the environments in one package from TM2, plus lagoon. If you're a newer player interested in TM, this is probably a good buy. I don't have any gripes with the pure gameplay aspects. There's some things missing that TM2 titles had, you can see lists in other reviews. So reluctance to switch over is pretty justified if you already own TM2 titles. And they did alter the handling of the cars a little, but as a canyon veteran, I can only really notice it there. And the lack of global track leaderboards (dedis, or even local server rankings) is a big thing too. I'm under the impression that TM2 Lagoon will still come out at some point in the future. And I hope Nadeo gives maniaplanet more love.It's a fun game for what it is, a console trackmania game that was released on PC too. But it's not the sequel to TM2. So it's hard to recommend this game to a lot of the more hardcore fans of Trackmania 2, unless you want an early peek at Lagoon.			",127,27,9,20,14,3,48

												I only feel the need to write this review because of all the repetivtive and rather dull negative reviews I've been seeing.I have been a trackmania player since Nations/United. While my performance is higher than average, I consider myself the casual trackmania player and fan. I get on the game, play a bunch of races, and depnding on my mood or if some ♥♥♥♥♥ nab my third place spot with 10 seconds left, I'll be done for the day. Rinse and repeat for a few years.Trackmania Turbo doesn't really deviate from things. 4 different environments with 4 very different cars and feels of gameplay. Desert and Stadium don't really have any new sort of trackpieces, and that's fine by me (considering we've been playing the same Stadium since Nations/United). Rollercoaster Lagoon brings a whole new feel to the series, and I will admit that the rollercoaster style, fast-paced driving upside-down is FUN. I will play this game as I have the pervious games the same way, and I will enjoy every session.So what if it has no replays (yet), so what if it has no custom servers (yet), and who cares about the Uplay thing (seriously, stop whining such little children every time Uplay is involved). If you are a casual, or a little more than casual Trackmania player like myself, YOU WILL HAVE FUN. The game JUST came out, and so many ""devoted fans"" are down this game's throat already. It helps to provide constructive feedback to improve a game, and not just repeat what the last guy is saying and follow a useless bandwagon. Sure, adding the desired features would be nice, but for now: Enjoy racing, enjoy the loops and bounds, and enjoy getting your first place spot taken with 10 seconds left.			",46,9,4,5,2,1,13

												It's a fun game.  The controls are as tight as always, and the 80's arcade styling is a welcome overarching theme that ties the game together well.  The game is as fast-paced as always, and the integral trackbuilder is as good as ever.  Multiplayer has a nice variety of new and returning modes, and the single-player campaign is very nicely expanded.On the flip side, the Trackbuilder STILL has parts only Nadeo can use, the Shaders and graphical quality are noticably worse than TrackMania 2 as a result of this being primarily a console game, and there still isn't a local splitscreen multiplayer where it's about getting the best time on a track, within a given time limit.  Seems that's still restricted to LAN party gaming.The new Lagoon environment is awesome and the magnetic coaster is a great new element, but the Stadium environment could have used a little more love and the Rally/Desert environments are good but not overly noteworthy.In short, if you have Trackmania 2 then only get Turbo if you want the coaster environment, otherwise just get the TM2 environments piecemeal.

												This game is a lot of fun. I almost didn't buy after reading the complaints by self declared experts in the TM2 franchise.

												Short review after a couple of hours. (Did it with google translator from german to english)The game modes are ok in itself. Disappointing, I find that you have to work all during the game. I have purchased the game as a whole, and not one by one ...The Level Editor is cheese. Would be nice if there's little that is worked off. For example, everything what lies beneath the soil is destroyed when filling the terrain. A grid is also missing. The selection of parts used to be better when you have entered only the number combination.Why you can not change the settings for a route in retrospect, it is not clear. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												8/10 - GO FOR THE GOLD!!!!!!!SIMPLY SPEAKING:: if you like Trackmania.....BUY THIS GAME!!!.......if you are still thinking about buying this game just think of Hot Wheels, with a hint of Trials and F-Zero.......how does that sound?!?!?!?dont let other peoples opinion affect yours, if you like Trackmania or racing games n general, buy this game its honestly a good solid game with good controls, an easy to use editor, and UI if you come from consoles or are just a universal gamer is decent, there are 200+ levels and a random track builder if tou dont feel like being creative....its a good game.Longer Review:wa wa wa all the PC trackmania players are complaining about the lack of costomizations and leaderboards and other stuff stuff like FOV, etc......but just remember.....................this is a PC port of a console port of a PC game so its meant to be played with a controller, as long as you have one of those you hould be good to go....so far this game its one of the funnest Trackmania games I have played, the editor in my opinion is easy to use with a controller,  I feel the controls feel good and repounsive and arcady in a good way not too realistic and not too stiff, the graphics are Amazing (just dont slow down !!! lol, there are alot of levels to keep you coming back.

												I'm changing my review after it seems they have fixed the bug where the game would crash when I wanted to play it with a Steam Controller. @ Hennihenner below, told you so!The game plays great, and i do love the solo maps they added. I love the way you are dropped by a helicopter in some of the maps is a great addon. And I also love the track pieces they added compared to the previous versionsBut there are some reasons you might want to skip this game, when it comes to customisations. There are some achievement unlocks to be able to use some decals or paintjobs, but it's not possible anymore to create your own textures for your car or tracks and impossible to replace the 3D model of the car.Also I personally hate Uplay, but in the end it wasn't reason enough to not play this game.Because there are no options between Yes and No to select when recommending this game, I will choose Yes only because on itself this is still a great game.

												As noted by many many others, the editor is selectable, and as a LONG term TMU player GOOD RIDDENCE ON THE HORN.  Picking on crap like that to call the game bad is as dumb as a sack of hammers.  The game has a few flaws, stuff like the sand buggy physics are all screwey (sand should not be ice... just sayin), but it's a blast and it's nice that Ubisoft only charged 40$ for it.  Also, Uplay takes 10 minutes to setup, and I have ignored it since, what's the freaking issue people? Totally worth it. -Chitlenz			",142,43,34,27,13,3,31

												The Trackmania I know and love is in here and I like the way the cars drive and the whole game really however the litany of bugs in this current version is unworthy of an Early Access title never mind a full launch. Exclusive fullscreen won't work at anything other than the lowest resolutions, the audio quality in general is very low and if you try to turn off the countdown announcers who seem to be speaking in a random language every restart you can't as that setting is seemingly ignored all together, the only AA option is FXAA which in itself seems to be a very bad implementation and there is no settings menu in place to tweak the graphics settings properly.The game is as good as it's always been but the package it's wrapped up in is terrible.

												Its really, really bad..No good keyboard support whatsoever, no optimizable graphics, no controls menu, no tutorial. I couldn't even Gas and Break, the car drove itself forward. It said: Shift to accelerate. Didnt do sh*t. Nothing worked except steering. I tried to play with my Xbox Controller, Didnt work either. Not to mention that freaking Uplay sneaks up on you as well. That descrasefull Turd is also attached to launching the game, so once again you're stuck with that useless third wheel as well.Im a BIG fan of all the other Trackmania games. But this one, is just Really Really bad(as almost all game that are on Uplay are).It really feels like this game is still in Alpha, and nothing is working properly yet. So yeah. Its bad, and i DO NOT recomend it eventhough it hurts to say that, cause i really used to love the Trackmania Francise. Dont even want it in my Games Library, just went for the refund..

												Lagoon car physics totally ruins game.  If you enjoyed TM1 and 2 then stay away because they have made the cars all but undrivable in 2 of the 4 biomes.  Real shame because graphically it's better than both earlier TM's but the ""driveability"" just isn't there.  Stadium is pretty good, but you need to fight through the other three areas to get there and the car steering is just hopeless in 2 of them.  In TMU the car physics were quite different in each of the 7 biomes but they were all fun and the learning curve was quick and steady and you eventually master it.  In TM Turbo it's almost like the more you get the hang of it the harder it gets - to the point where a small tap on the steering button is enough to send the car careering into the wall or a cascade of over-compensation resulting in you coming to a halt facing the wrong direction when all you ever wanted to do was turn a little to the left.  How could they let such a fault through testing?  Not recommended, don't buy because you will regret.			",43,1,3,1,1,0,2

												This isn't a review, it's a first impression of the game in it's current launch-state. A review needs more time!I have a about 400 to 500 hours in all trackmania titles I own, so I spent a little time on the tracks.The Solo campaign is awesome. 200 Tracks with 4 different cars is enought in my opinion, but I saw some tracks rebuilded from the previous releases (Tm2/Tmnf), but seriously I don't mind. And now i need to rage a bit...->Where is the profile editor? It will use the name you currently have in Uplay! Bye bye fancy colored names. Bye bye horn uploader. Bye bye Clan tag.->Everytime someone joins the multiplayer room a message on the left side of the screen pops up that forces you to press a button to say hello... While you are driving...->I couldn't find a button to turn off enemy cars. Ye it's awesome to start with 100 people from one single spot. Btw everyone has their names over the cars. Can't turn that off either.->You might noticed by now the game lacks on settings... Well guess what happens when we take a look into the graphics settings. More than half the settings are missing. Is this game a console port?-> If you played the previous TM's you will know Maniaplanet. You could switch between games, visit internet sites etc. Poof gone.->The game is completely optimized for Controllers. You won't need a mouse. But wait... Car customization? Track building? Is it now easier witht he same amount of customization? I don't know yet, time will show!Okay enough of the rage. This games doesn't feel unfinished... I just ask myself who decided to rip out so much important stuff (I want my own profile /nickname/horn/club etc. :( ) Anyhow I will give it a thumbs up, because I know they will patch many stuff. As i said this isn't a review, just a first impression!I know that the Trackmania devs are always listening to their fanbase. Please guys hear at us! In the meantime I will play the campaign and Tm2...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A good Trackmania experience for consoles, ported back to the PCTL;DRI'd not be recommending this at full price. If you're a first timer who wants to try out TM, get the older freewares and try them out to see if TM is your thing. TM Turbo is more of a reboot of the series for the next-gen console age (& PC), and it's a fun and good reboot at that. If you liked the freewares and don't own TM2, this won't disappoint you much.Full Review:A reasonably priced and equally good addition to the TM franchise. While it still plays like TM (acc,brake,left,right), the PC version isn't without it's issues. This game feels like it was made for consoles and to be fair, that's kind of true. It was a NinDS title years back and even the beta was only available for PS4/XBone. However, since the previous titles were exclusive to PCs, a full PC support is a given considering its history. If you're someone who's looking for that, this isn't that game. Here are some things that I disliked about this PC version- Settings (graphics,input) -> Move cursor up to the top of the screen and click the gear icon in the drop down bar. I'd have preferred them to be somewhere more visible, like in the settings menu. Graphics Issues -> If you turn up all water reflection to max possible and look at the water, there's black dots everywhere. Solution? Turn down water reflection to medium. (controller) ZeroVery little rumble on my F710 with XInput. Also, I coundn't find any controller layout screen. (controller) An issue where if want to drift with LT(brake)+Stick, it won't register the LT as brake if RT(acc) is also pressed down. Feature downgrade -> No private servers. All rooms hosted on dev servers. Feature downgrade -> Servers have max 100 players, far fewer than it should've been. Feature downgrade -> Customisation is restricted to paint jobs and decals. However, paintjobs/decals arent' car specific and are applied to every single car for all the environments. The playlist is nice but there's only a couple in there and after the first few tracks, it's repetitive. More variety or an in-built custom playlist support would've been nice. 3 of 4 environments are from the previous game though it looks beautiful here. (Lagoon will be added to TM2 as DLC) UPLAY BONUS -> If you're in a region, say, a country which you know is in the continent you've  been given the key for, you won't be able to activate it if Ubisoft thinks you aren't in the region. Tough luck; get a VPN and activate it anyway. I know it's UPlay but I didn't expect this.Nevertheless, the game is fun and a TM game at its core- Race tracks are pretty varied, starting with simple turns that get more challenging as you progress. Feels more driftier but I could be wrong. The environment is beautiful for a game where the sole focus is on cutting down every unnecessary millisecond off your lap time. And the map is open-world ish. If your eyes can see it, your drive can drive there. 


you could probably go anywhere you can see on the map

 Carries over the track builder for countless hours of extra gameplay. Would've been nice if there was a Steam Workshop type feature for sharing user created tracks offline but I don't think that'll happen. Because you see, consoles don't do that, so PC can't. Runs at a near constant 60fps at 1080p with every setting maxed out on i7-4710HQ + 860M. No DLC or micro-transactions, at least none that I know of.Every positive point here isn't something new to TM and it isn't something that TM Turbo does better than it's predecessors. Yes it has got much better graphics and yes it now has a dynamic soundtrack. The game if anything, has been dumbed down. But I still like to play it and I have fun playing it. It's a good reboot, just not a good enough TM sequel.			",65,6,6,7,4,0,3

												was really into it for the first couple of hours and then the cracks started to show.The developer did (mostly) a great job of tightening up all the weird Trackmania 2 stuff into a neat little package. It has a nice coat of paint on it and is quite cohesive (mostly).They revamped the cars to make them more hotrod like, there's an announcer dude reacting to whatever you do on the track, the existing environments have been spiced up with these weird neon signs, there's turbo flames coming out of your car when getting onto a boost. Everytime there's the 3 2 1 countdown before a race starts, it happens in a different language. The game has a killer intro movie. There's these weird cool quotes on the loading screens.The online custom track sharing is very bad. No straightforward way to find, download and play custom tracks in a game where the Trackbuilder is featured so prominently that it's on the very first line in the main menu. It isn't helped by the fact that you can't name any of your tracks. All the tracks you make follow the naming structure of ""Username [Tracknumber] [Tracklength] [Trackstyle]"", e.g. ""Kewlsnake 17 Short Tech"" would be a track I made. Oh and you can't delete any of the tracks that you upload online!The server names follow a similar naming structure as the tracknames and I think this combined with the very rudimentary custom track sharing will severely hamper the online community component in the long run.I think the singleplayer campaign is pretty great, it features 200 tracks from the 4 different environments (one new for this game, the others have been featured in other games). I think the unlocking of tracks could've been handled better. You need to get either bronze/silver or gold medals in 100% of the previous maps to unlock the next set of maps which is always a different environment. I would've liked to see that doing well in Stadium maps would unlock more Stadium maps for me or that if I did very well in previous maps and got either silver or gold medals instead of the required bronze, I would unlock certain sets of maps earlier. Now I'm forced to get medal X in 100% of previous maps to unlock the next set. I would've liked that getting medal X in most of the maps would've been enough to unlock the next map.The local coop component seems to be pretty fleshed out. You have Hotseat, Arcade, Split Screen, Mono Screen and a Double Driver campaign all for coop fun. There is also a ""secret"" mode where you can enter cheat codes which consists out of punching in 3 of the face buttons to get one of the local coop modes + a twist. Very cool in concept, in practice quite ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because the 64 possible different combinations only end up in the 4 local coop modes + a couple of very minor changes, giving out 9 different ""modes"" in total.There's a Stunts mode in the game that the game barely acknowledges. You can enable it on the online servers but zero explanation about it.You can save replays, the game never acknowledges how you can do this (you press R).There's this random track generator in the game which is cool. I don't think the tracks it makes are particularly great. I feel like you need to slowdown a lot or you'll crash into something in the air or the turns aren't properly signaled or there's a turbo just before this very tight turn. Stuff like that. Maybe good for tech tracks?I think the car customization stuff is ok. Not elaborate but you can unlock more stuff by getting more gold medals and it has a nice progression. You can also get upto 6 ""Legendary Paintworks"" by spending uplay points which is a total makeover for your car. I personally like the Double Driver one a lot.In general, I don't think I would recommend a purchase unless you're interested in the singleplayer campaign / local coop part. If you're interested in a vibrant online community, go buy Trackmania 2: Stadium for 5 bucks on Steam now or try out the demo or try out Trackmania Nations Forever which is free.The release of Turbo has revitalised TM2: Stadium again which is cool.I think it's pretty sad/funny that even in the new Turbo game, people keep playing Stadium, even in favor of the new environment (Rollercoaster Lagoon).EDIT: Some things that are cool about Turbo that aren't immediately noticeable.There is an ""Use Joker"" option after finishing a track that's greyed out initially. Say that you need to get a Silver Medal for a track to proceed but can't quite manage to hit that time. After you hit the bronze medal 3 times, you will get a ""Silver Joker"" which allows you to proceed to the next track.On top of that, there's some cool visual language going on in the campaign track selection screen.In the start, if you get the required bronze medals for the next tracks to unlock, they squares will get filled up. From the moment you need to score silver medals to unlock more tracks, only the squares where you have gotten silver medals are filled. So the game adjusts to what you're needing at that moment which is cool.Also, see the 23 that's coloured in green? That's a track where I've gotten the Trackmaster medal (Which is where I've beaten the time of the track author).See how the 55 track is half filled? That's because it's a track where I've obtained the Silver Joker that I talked about earlier. It counts as a Silver medal for all accounts and purposes but if I want to get a ""legit"" silver medal, I can always go back to that track and get it.Pretty cool!			",286,71,18,36,21,9,29

They need to expand the audience, this game is made for consoles, but Nadeo was nice enough to release it for PC so its main audience didn't miss out. It is a big degrade from previous games, but it is still an amazing trackmania game. it does have its issues, but its still really good :)			",134,37,4,25,9,4,36

												I went into this game with an open mind: I dont like ubisoft, but Ive never tried trackmania before and thought the predesessors looked cool. Gameplaywise its not what I expected from the trailer: its all just ghost driving. Your driving against other players, but they are just ghosts whom you couldnt interact with. I just felt plain lonely by playing this game, and didnt feel as if I was playing with other players. Insta refund			",75,13,0,9,23,0,17

												PROS+ The gameplay is as solid and as fun as ever.+ Simple concept and no feature bloat like in ManiaplanetCONS- Leaderboards are limited to your uplay friends- filters and ordering is lacking in server and map lists - thus what you looking for is harder to find.- As this game has console origins, it's not optimised for pc.The hate this game gets is not because it's not fun - TM Turbo is very much enjoyable. The hate is from Nadeo removing someones darling feature, and they just can't get over it - the game has different concept from what us old fans have gotten used to. TM2 has no players, so if you want to play Trackmania multiplayer on PC, Turbo is your best chance.This game is recommended with reservation, as the community might not last that long on PC.

												Wonderful Cartoony Graphics, extremely simple but responsive controls, insanely impossible Race tracks, a system that makes you want to play more and more and more and a soundtrack full of the same song with different names! Could only be TrackMania!With hundreds and hundreds of different courses to challenge yourself with, a mode where two people can control the same car and a detailed ranking system where you can even see your rank in the state/province/county you live in you will be playing this game for months.It controls really well, don't get me wrong it's definately Arcade controls but that is not a bad thing. It is really easy to pick up and play for a begginger but to master this you will have to put the hours in but it is worth it. (It's a great feeling when you go from scratching the barriers on every corner to being the fastest in your country!) Only played the campaign so far so I can't comment on the other game modes but I know they will not dissapoint! Alot of the reviews for this game don't actually talk about the game but target ubisoft instead which is odd for a game review... Seems to happen frequently these days on Steam.This is a great place to start for Trackmania and is a refreshing change of pace from other games out there.			",116,31,3,6,11,0,1

												I have played every Trackmania game to date. This is primarily going to compare them, but also think of Turbo as a standalone game, over a series of topics;1) Customization - Since the original Trackmania, players have always been able to customly paint cars without any set grids and whatnot. However, in Turbo, this isn't the case, as players customize their cars through set options that are gained by earning Gold Medals in the campaign. As much as this is a downgrade from previous installments, it finally gives a reason for those who just want to play the game to actually try the campaign. Would I call this a perk? That depends- for people such as myself, who have never been good at designing a car to begin with, yes. However, for those who can actually take the time to make a good-looking skin, no, this is a drastic loss.2) Local Multiplayer - Hotseat has been around since the original trackmania, and split-screen since Trackmania 2. However, also in every previous installment was Profiles- a big loss specifically to me. Profiles used to be kept with the game and were for all those who played the game to enter their profile, change their car, make maps, and etc. However, Trackmania Turbo gets rid of Profiles, but still has Hotseat, in a more of an arcade fashion, where each player, when it is there turn, has the option to change their name using 4 letters. A massive loss, in my mind, however, the gameplay of the new hotseat is nice. Split Screen hasn't changed much, so not much to say on that.3) Map Editor - A huge step up from the previous games. The Beginner mode, introduced in Nations & United Forever, helped people completely new to the game make maps with reasonably good detail in the background. Now, the difference between Normal mode and Advanced mode is one that I find perfectly fitting. For those who want to make perfect, amazing maps- Advanced mode is great, as it's completely barren from the start, and you can edit every little thing. For others who simply want a track to play on, Normal mode is very helpful, as you can build the map very quickly with various presets, and also have decoration filled in for you. Not to mention the landscapes are all as set templates. And the final amazing improvement to the Map Editor is the Random Track Generator- which I'm in love with. The Random Track Generator is literally an AI that pieces together the various presets from Normal Mode in a varying fashion each time. I'm still unsure as to what it prioritizes, but that makes the tracks even more fun.4) Campaign & Singleplayer - Realistically, the only difference between this and the previous games is that the campaign actually has a reason to be played now- for unlockables. However, on the downside, it forces you to play all 10 tracks of the previous difficulty & environment before moving to the next, unlike previous Trackmania games. Not much else to say here.5) Online Multiplayer - Being a part of the Nations/United Forever Dirty Deeds clan, I was playing multiplayer quite frequently on Forever. From what I can say, there's only a time attack mode for online so far, as compared to previous; Time Attack, Rounds, Team, Cup, etc. It's a bit of a let-down, but at the same time, most multiplayer servers from Forever were Time Attack anyways. Past this is also the stats for tracks, which people seemed to have valued. As much as I do miss seeing the world-wide fastest time on a track, it was a mod for Trackmania, never actually part of the game, so we can't really include it here. There's no more dedicated servers, which is a but upsetting, as it means everything is now hosted by people, BUT, it makes it much easier to set up a quick server for yourself and a few friends.There's a bit more to the game that I'm not putting here, but that's mainly because it's not really comparable with other installments, or I've yet to experience it myself. From how I've enjoyed the game so far, I do recommend Trackmania veterans, and newcomers, to play the game, as it certainly, at least for me, lives up to the hype I've had since July.

												Few things you should know. 1) It's a spin-off of Trackmania 2 but I don't care because this is my first Trackmania game. 2) It's ""nut-punchingly hard"" as one review put it. He also said it was the dark souls of car games. Now, even though beating the gold medal times may be impossible the first time through you just have to push past that and not really care. That was hard for me the first day of playing until I realized that it wasn't just me struggling with the difficulty. 3) You should buy this game solely for the track making. You get everything the devs used and even 3 different modes for creating with increasingly complex UI.4) It's the best arcade-style racing game I've ever played. Seriously, don't pay attention to the reviews. Was Fallout 4 as bad as the reviews would lead you to believe?			",174,38,9,20,46,1,24

												Trackmania® Turbo is GREAT and GREAT fun for a casual player but it has alot less customization than the previous games.Im not into the competitive scene in this game as I'm yet not very good at it. The game has great graphics and the trackmania 2 enviroments and the new lagoon. The track editor is very sloppy and slow to build with but you  can enable the classic editor from the options menu. All it really is, is a console port so I really really recommend playing it with a controllerIve had a great 50 hours of fun already and will go play the game after this review. Stick with trackmania 2 stadium if you just want good times and do good lines, but if you want to play a fun game and just chill and drive, get this game.40€ price tag seems like alot but after a 100 hours im pretty sure it wont hurt as much.

												So, Trackmania Turbo. I've played trackmania for a long time. If you are a long time TM player then this game wont be really beneficial to you. The reason being is that this is basically the same game with the exception of Lagoon environment. If you have not played any previous TM games or played a bit then this would be relatively nice value proposition. Also if you have a console it may be better to grab this game there.P.S. Am I the only one who thinks that playing Lagoon on the controller is far worse than on keybooard?			",135,4,4,11,7,2,23

												Trackmania Turbo is admittedly a little bit of a step back in terms of customisation options in the series, and also in terms of multiplayer server customisability, but the game as a whole feels like a much better rounded package from the start. TM2's system just felt a bit splintered, but Turbo feels like a nice, cohesive single product. Gone is the dreadful interface from the last few titles in favour of something a lot slicker. The game's engine is as smooth as ever and the game looks great too. Each environment immediately feels a blast to play, and multiplayer is as addictive as ever.You might feel a little short changed if you bought all the individual parts of TM2 as there's not a lot new here, but I'm personally happy to have everything under one roof.Note that if you pine for the classic track builder, it's still there - just move your mouse to the top right of the screen and select it in the options menu.

												You know it is not a good trackmania when there isn't an option to hide the other cars, or customize your nickname. This game has been made without the pc community (which means its historical community) in mind, and tried to appeal to a new public. No more points, obscure leveling ladder, strange music system, badly designed UI, a lot of the Trackmania feeling is gone.Reminder that no customized nickname means there won't be any clans, because if you can't share your awesome colored tag, who cares?Now more subjectively I do not find the lagoon environment enjoyable. It looks quite good, but the buggie driving is hard (which is not necessarily bad) but above all extremely frustrating and not really rewarding. The design of some of the blocks is however interesting and fun.I will say that Stadium and Canyon have seen very slight rework and are both still very enjoyable to play despite all the issues... The licence is awesome but this game isn't.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It feels like a bad console port. The previous installments felt a lot snappier, everything seems to have been set aside to make it look cool, at cost of the games mechanics.The effects added in the game have a very unnecessary look to them, a bit like those stereotypical Japanese ads.The multiplayer is a joke compared to what it used to be on pc, and the singleplayer forces you to play every environment, you can't only play stadium or canyon, you would have to play valley and lagoon aswel.The customization is a total let down, creative freedom has been removed.And finally, the single most popular part of Trackmania, the track editor/creator, had been swapped with a cluncy, downgraded, console-friendly version wich doesn't suit pc-controls in any way.But the cherry on the top remains ""Uplay"" (short for: ""U won't play long""), Ubisofts' version of Origin, not as bad.. doesn't stop it from feeling like a cancer growing in your testicals: unless you're Randy Marsh, you don't want it, you know you don't want it let alone ""need it"", EVERYONE BLOODY KNOWS NOBODY WANT'S IT!

												While this game takes strides in presentation and production values for a TrackMania game, it unfortunately seems to have taken a step back everywhere else. Skin customization has been replaced with a disappointing mix-and-match editor that leaves you with a choice of skin and one sticker - this removes quite a bit of the personalization I felt in Trackmania 2. Furthermore, it's a straight-up console port. While some may not notice the omission of post-processing effects from the settings menu, most will notice the incredibly short draw distance of shadows - a feature that cannot be changed. Layer the lack of community-hosted servers, the inability to use custom blocks in maps (say goodbye to role-playing tracks) and the fact that Trackmania 2 is all but confirmed to receive a Lagoon environment game, and I cannot recommend Trackmania Turbo to anyone.

You can expect to find anything you found in the old games with improved graphics but also completely new environments with completely differing cars for each of them. Online multiplayer works perfectly on day one and this game just gernerally feels finished. It is optimized very well and I haven't found any relevant bugs until now.

												So, there is another Trackmania game by Nadeo.Very surprised for a lot of new stuff and gamemodes. The game looks very realistic (in graphics) and the gameplay is very good too. :PThe new Lagoon envinroment is really fun to play and its definitly one of the craziest TM envis ever.The game itself misses a lot of things like saving replays, so you need to record your best times and you cant change your inputs, so the game looks like it's in beta. So I hope they will fix these main things soon. (actually this exists, but its really not how it has to be)Really enjoyable game with a lot of stuff around. Definitly worth it for such a big price!

												It is a great game with good track building, career mode, and online. The track building is very well done as the grid based track placements seems non-existant while driving. It may seemed dumb down right when you start, but you need to show the upper bar, click the gear, and switch to classic track builder to get the editor designed for m/kb. Career mode offers a large amount of tracks with a hard challange ahead to get every gold metal. It is a nice break from the norm of racing as this game focuses on hotlaps and track mastery then position based races. All the tracks have intense stunts and high speed which is brought together with a great sence of speed, awesome optimization (100 fps average on max settings multi and singleplayer with a Radeon R9 270X) and great physics. Costumization is great even though I see negative comments complaining about no horn (If you play any source game and you hear a person using Source DJ you see how custom sounds gets very annoying quick so you'll be glad) and no custom skins (if they had this I bet 40% of all skins will be anime porn). Overall, this is a good buy for anyone who likes racing games and it is worth full price so no sale needed to pick this one up.			",48,4,4,5,6,0,2

												This game is getting way more hate than it deserves.  Just going to start by getting that out of the way.  I've been playing Trackmania for over a decade, and I feel like I'm the only diehard Trackmania fan that isn't being blinded by nostalgic fluff.It's fast, it runs well, it looks nice, and the cars handle very well.  The physics for each pre-existing environment have been tweaked to varying degrees, most noticeable being Valley (I.E. Down and Dirty), where it doesn't feel practically impossible to turn on dirt without losing speed because you didn't have millimeter precision.  It feels much more fluid now than it did in TM2.New blocks have been added for each environment, which helps keep it from feeling too samey to TM2, and adds some new surprises to each environment.If there were one complaint I do overall agree with, it is the lack of leaderboards per track (I.E. Dedi's).  Although to a casual player, this would largely be a useless feature anyways, as Dedi boards only really tended to matter for high skill players, as they are the only ones that ever make it onto them.That aside, the game plays great, and in the end, that is really what matters.  This is a time trials game with ridiculous over the top car physics, and it excels at being just that.  Although I haven't had the chance to try them, the new local multiplayer modes all look like they'd be a blast to play with friends, although it'd be nice if a few of them were available for online play (Though I understand why they aren't, as the majority of them would be complete garbage with latency between players).Overall, this is a great spinoff of the Trackmania series (Yes, this is a spin off, targetted to console players, not a sequel for PC players, get over it).  It may be lacking some fluff that the PC crowd is used to, but that's all it's really lacking... fluff.  The game itself is fantastic and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves arcade racers.

												The only real reasons people are complaining about TMT are because they can't use custom/user vehicles and horns. To be honest, that was all getting ridiculous. Like, COD ridiculous. Turbo still maintains the classic TrackMania look and feel, it still has insane tracks and top speeds, and there is at least some customisation. Not much, but still. Also, some people have been complaining about the pc controls being too sensitive. I onlg had problems with the Valley setting, but thats because I personally suck at it. (bloody trees), not because ""simply touching the direction keys make your car spin uncontrollably"". Yeah, it'd be great if UPlay was optional, seeing as I bought the game on Steam, and yeah, some freedom with customisation would be nice, especially changing colours so your car stands out a bit more. But to be honest, it is still a fun game and an enjoyable spinoff. Also, i paid around $60 for this game because im australian and forgot that it wouldnt actually be $40 here, so..

												This is a really hard one to make up my mind about. To start with I really liked it, and then as the differences between this and other TMs became apparent I felt increasingly less pleased with it.Those points have been discussed elsewhere by others, so I'll not add to that. Except to say that I did start to make a list of 'pros' and 'cons' comparing this with TM2, and quickly found 8 plus points and 21 negatives. (Although quite a few of the latter turn out to be things which have been community-provided for TM2; not in the original implementation. Although the points still stand, as I can't see the community getting behind Turbo in the same way.)But in the end I've decided it's a caveated 'Yes' for me.The thing is; I think it's actually a pretty good game in its own right. And if you completely ignore the orignal TMs for whatever reason, there really isn't anything else quite like it out there afaik. It certainly has that 'just one more go; I've almost got it now. And that last bad time was all entirely my own fault' feel to it. If you are new to TM, and/or want an accessible twitch-racer that's fresher and more 'this gen' than the (now a bit tired-looking) other TM games, then this may well be for you. It really is TM meets the console generation. And depending what you are looking for, that might not entirely be a bad thing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all: I like it!If you liked Trackmania² you will probably like this one. It has a nice and fresh feeling to it, mainly caused by the new blocks and car models. Yes, there are some problems that have been mentioned in other reviews and I don't want to go through them in detail. But the main point why I like it is simply that it has this great arcade-touch to it that was missing in the ManiaPlanet games a bit. In ManiaPlanet you had to read a lot of tutorials, guides and other information to get to know how things work exactly. Turbo is a bit different in this point. You start it and you see what you need and what you will get, simple as that. There is simply no need to learn things that don't belong to playing the game actually.Don't get me wrong. I still think that, when Lagoon is released for MP, there is no need for anyone to buy Turbo. But if you have some money to spare and want to support Nadeo (who actually did a good job on this one IMO) AND if you don't want to wait until Lagoon is released for MP: BUY THIS GAME!But before you buy it you should be clear about what you get. This game is actually Maniaplanet with a few tweaks here and there and with less complexity. I think it is good that the game isn't as complex as MP because it's much more beginner friendly. There is no blockmixing, no custom objects and no custom ingame skinning like in MP. If you can renounce those features you will probably like this game. If you can't live without these features better wait for Lagoon for MP.			",65,27,3,12,11,0,9

It makes it a little disappointing. I really dislike how there is no controller vibration. It feels like I'm not even playing a racing game. BUT, it is a fun game.

												I feel compelled to write a review for Trackmania Turbo because it's such a fun game to play and many of the negative reviews are written by Trackmania vets who are dissapointed about features that 90% of potential players will neither miss or notice.Common complaints include no private servers, lack of a certain camera view, only 100 players in a server instead of 700, no horn and no custom paintjobs. I can very well understand the frustration of players who are used to those features and I don't mean to belittle their complaints, perhaps this isn't the sequel for them. However some perspective should be given because if you're thinking about buying the game, honestly, reading that list how many of those complaints are that important to you. As a newcomer to the series they're not stopping me from enjoying the game in any way.Perhaps the game would be better with those features added and maybe I'll get hooked and start playing the other TM's looking for a more hardcore experience but right now Trackmania Turbo is a great entry point for people like me into the series, it's extremely fun in its own right.

												First I’ll start with a quote. Let's be professional here.""You're complaining about car customization in Trackmania? #Salt""2nd thing: if you’ve troubles with the new car editor, here’s how to get back to the old one =>http://s20.postimg.org/4vvkv5k4t/Classic.jpg (thanks kciuk)Alright, Tm Turbo is just released that you see a lot of bad critics. Please people try to be objective when you’re criticizing a game that just got released… You have an impact you know?Anyway, the game is dividing people, even myself I started to argue with a friend about that. My point? It’s a waste of time. There is obviously 2 sides, the “NO MORE CUSTOM? *cry* “and the “wow the game’s pretty good”. Personally I’ll push myself out of those two sides and I’ll focus on the stuff that really matters in the gameplay. Though, at the end, I’ll have to actually say something about the “lack of customs whining”.Anyway, the game’s pretty great, in term of feeling the speed and the basic tracks actually give quite a show off from the game, you’re soon absorbed by the variation of the music from your speed or how much tricks you’ll actually dare to do while doing a track. AS VETERAN.The only thing being aggressive in the gameplay is the steering… Jesus fkin Christ, at first it seemed to be an insult from how hard it was to make the cars turn… But then, I recalled my memories AKA “how to use the brake in trackmania” and a whole new world opened to me. A fluid game with high speed tricks. Since Trackmania Xtrem the cars weren’t that funky, with the stunt mode re-added I’m really looking forward for the maps that the community will create. Seriously, wait a bit before saying that opus is bad.NOW. To be franc, Trackmania Xtrem is and will be my 1st favorite. But here’s a good opponent, Turbo’s design is really awesome, the music is awesome, the immersion is awesome! When you play it online you can feel what a TrackMania has to give you! Competition. Skill. Fun and Try Hards.On a scale from one to 10 I’d give 7.5 to turbo. Due to the steering still a bit tricky at first sight… And also rally environment... Wth is wrong with that environment? It’s like the game programmers put and awful lot of trajectory randomizers… But again… It’s an environment to master (reminding me the snow environment of TM 1). Now here comes the fun part. You guys knew that was going to be a console porting, don’t be surprised of the look of the UI or the actual server hosting from Nadeo… And yet. Guys. You’re on pc… I’m pretty sure mods will fall in our hands soon. Just wait and see.Also there’s saltiness about the lack of customs… Refer yourself to my quote… The cars have a lot of combination paintings… maybe you can’t put “FUKC ♥♥♥♥♥€S GET $$$” on your car’s hood which was a Lamborghini model instead of the basic stadium racing car or put a kiddy pseudo with lots of eye burning colors or have a horn with a music of Justin Bieber… But please… If you really were playing Trackmania for those I invite you to buy the Sims. If trackmania got popular it’s because of the driving… Not having the most pimped car/most annoying horn/ most psychedelic pseudo.I think I made my point there… But here’s a TLDR:From my POV Turbo is pretty decent besides a slight modification in the driving that you have to get used to, but besides that the universe is really Juicy, giving a good feeling of a retro arcade game with a really bright future that the community has to fill with lots of cool tracks. Now it’s focusing on skill and not custom cars or other things which weren’t needed for the basic gameplay. To me the lack of customs is forgotten for the awesome universe they put TM. By the way I heard about a demo… Get it if your opinion is split, make your own experience of Trackmania Turbo.Besides that… See you online ;) Thanks for reading. :) ",141,9,8,13,14,1,0

												So far the released game has been in my library couple of hours and I've played through the white stage, almost. Easy stuff. Graphics looks good and the games runs smoothly. I like how colorful the world is. Feels like trackmania should feel. Awesome and very playable. Although comparing how much the game cost and and how much there is actually the new stuff, this feels little bit too expensive. The only real new what I see is the double driver thing, which I've not tried and not even going to bother. It doesn't even sound something I would like. Going to check the online stuff once I've played the most of the solo/offline tracks. Hope it's worth the money. Even if this feels kinda expensive I'd still recommend to play this. It's not any worse than the older trackmanias :)			",81,29,20,2,3,3,7

												If I was to rate this game for what Trackmania does well, which is a very fun game, and an excellent arcade driving experience, then as always it has to be 10/10........butAs others have said, if i was rating it with what we PC players have come to expect from the series, then 0/10.This makes it hard to recommend, on the one hand, its Trackmania, and a lot of fun, and challenging in parts, and the new rollercoaster tracks you can create, are just a supurb addition.But now with only rankings based on how long you play, the lack of world/local records, means those who don't play very often, but used to be able to get these records, will find little joy here now, as there is no emphasis to play, there is no community, just lots of people saying the same things over and over again with the press of a button.I am not a console player, never have been, so don't know how this sits compared to other games, but this game as a PC game is severely lacking in what it should be offering, and it has only been out for one day, so this may change, but other key factors are missing, that we have come to expect from the series, including hide other cars, leaderboards, control customization, individuality and much more, and even though these don't take enough from the game to make it unplayable, it seems to take a lot from the game for those fans of the series, to make it not enjoyable enough to play.Overall, its trackmania, you can still find enjoyment here even with the lack of features, just a slight dissapointed feeling of enjoyment.

												Another great example of why you should never take Steam reviews seriously.This game has better graphics than it's predecessor, runs better, has more tracks, unifies all of the themes into one game (so no segregated userbase), AND is pretty cheap.But noooo that's not good enough for some fans.""-NO DEDICATED SERVERS-NO DEDIMANIA PLUGINS ETC.-NO CUSTOMIZATION (HORN, AVATAR, ETC)-TRACKBUILDER IS CRAPYou owe us Ubisoft, I can't have fun with this game.""Those are the things you will find in literally every negative review here.

												I played the campaign with a friend in DoubleDriver mode and it was so awesome to notice how our driving styles started to synchronize. After a few tracks we started to get really good and we enjoyed the game even more than just play with splitscreen.The feel of driving is still as good as in previous TM editions and the four different car types just feel a bit different to each other.The graphics are beautiful and very fast and should run with lower settings on older machines without any issues.The game is awesome and I just can recommend it.Notes about the complains in other reviews:- People complain about UPlay, but I didn't had any issues with it during my first session. Don't judge a game by it's container. Without Ubisoft we wouldn't be able to play the game.- People complain about that the customization has gone - and yes, it feels a bit wired to show the winner of an internet match and all look the same. I guess this will change once the people start changing the color and stickers on their cars.- Trackmania has evolved. Evolving means to change things to something different. Good or bad is a subjective feeling so please don't tell people to stop buying the game just because you don't like it.- You want to play a game that's just like the old TM Stadium or TM Canyon? Then go and play the old editions.			",214,18,10,14,31,0,26

												People who want to use the classic build mode in Turbo, you need to go to the top right part of the window. Click the little gear icon and select 'Classic Build Mode'. For people that like using mouse and keyboard that's the one to choose. I almost made a review on how much I wanted to shoot the guy responsible for coming up with the idea of a new trackbuilder that was too console heavy. As for the game, it's basically everything (Valley and Canyon and Stadium with a new style) updated for Windows 10 and so on. So far I'm enjoying the hell out of it. Though the resolution problem could be fixed, which eventually I know it will. Loving this game for the price.			",179,7,11,18,10,0,16

												They really did revamp the series this time. It was a good call to bring the all loved driving mechanics from TM2 (with a slight bit of polish) and put them into a whole new graphical glory. Plus they added new game modes (such as the Double Driver thingy) mainly made for the local multiplayer purposes only (at least you have something cool to show off to your sleepover buddies during their stay). And not to mention the fact that this game runs smoothly, as it shouldHowever, there is a downside to all that: console first development.This is can be seen in a lack of modding support, simplicity of some UI elements and in the overall variety of in-game customisations when compared to TM2. Video and other major settings for PC gamers have been dumped in to a ""config launcher"" thing, which can only be accessed when you boot the game (not a big deal to me as long everything works as expected).Overall the game is awesome!It was made for the masses and maybe better so. The barrier of entry feels significantly lower now, which naturally should attract new fans to the series. It plays well in this casual-ish setting but yet can show its teeth on harder levels, so the hardcore side is still there waiting to be unleashed.Definite pick for a newcomer, die hard fans may still consider.

												My favorite arcade racing game in 18 years! Super recommended!(Since F-Zero X and R4: Ridge Racer Type 4)My initial review had ended there already, but since I'm a little shocked about all the negative reviews and comments about this game, I decided to write some more...TMT is time trial based racing at its very best. The controls are responsive and nuanced, the track designs are outstanding, and there is a lot of content and variety, both online and offline. The fine developers at Nadeo have crafted a unique game with an abundance of imaginative features and ideas. It really succeeds to fill a void, that so many rather standardized modern racing games have left behind.The game can be quite hard, especially the Rollercoatser Lagoon setting, and to feel some frustration is part of what Trackmania is about. Still, Nadeo has achieved a balanced progression in the campaign mode, which always gives you enough rewards and incentives to continue. I'm usually not too much into super challenging games, but TMT is absolutely addicting.And the presentation of TMT is fantastic. A great color scheme evoking memories of 90's arcade racing, some of the coolest original cars and environments in a long time, and very nice signage and typography. While the later is not quite on the level of what Designers Republic did for the WipEout series, it does come pretty close sometimes. Many complaints here on Steam are targeted at the limited customization options compared to previous Trackmania games, but I find it hard to understand, why anyone would want to change any of those assets. The game achieves an amazing coherent art style, which is just a pure joy to experience.TMT is more focused and polished than any Trackmania game before, making it my favorite Trackmania experience by far. I'm very inclined to say that this is one of the best arcade racers of all time!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have never played Trackmania before so this is my 1st one. I saw it at E3 2015 and thought it looked amazing. I am seeing alot of people say older Trackmania's are better, I cannot comment as I have never played any of the others. However, what I will say is for new people to the series I think it is alot of fun. It feels alot like Trials Fusion but cars instead as on some track restarting happens often haha. The game looks amazing and perfoms at around 120-144fps (V-Sync 144hz Monitor) with a 6GB 980Ti & I7-4790k Quad Core 4.4ghz Turbo. So performance & stability is awesome. I haven't played online much but from what I have played I quite like it. I don't really have anything bad to say about this game at this current point but the game is still young. I will update my review once I play around some more. But for now I will say. If you are new try it out, if you are a TM veteran still try it out as its fun anyway.Early review 9/10 (Missing 1 due to some graphics options being unchangeable for some reason)EDIT (AFTER PLAYING SOME MORE):I played quite a bit more since and I do not understand why this game gets some of the hate that it gets. I still have fun playing this game up until this day. It does get a bit rage inducing when trying to perfect some of the later levels but that is where the fun is also ;P.10/10 I have no problems with this game whatsoever. Haters?

												I was sceptical because all of the bad Reviews but i gotta say: This Game is hella fun. Just like the old Trackmania titles, this one has tech maps where you will rage a lot. Im serious.. A LOT. But that doesnt hurt the game because when u do that map you will feel so good that you would love to kiss the developers. It's not a game where you mindlessly hold the speed button, it's a game where skill is required. It's sad that you cant customize things as much, but it's okay after all.Graphics 9/10Gameplay 9/10 Music 5/10 (gets annoying pretty fast, but has nice effects on different speed levels)Community Solid 10/10 really nice helpful people.Overall 5/7 Kappa9/10 ",115,12,1,9,15,0,10

												TrackMania Turbo is basically TrackMania 2.5 with a few silly things removed... but also a few not-silly things removed, that hopefully will be added later, because removing them goes against the game's design.None of the detractors are talking about these not-silly things. This game has a ""mixed"" reception entirely because of the silly things. For better or worse, you will never find this reception on the consoles.It's shinier than TM2, it has more content than TM2, and it's even cheaper than TM2 at their retail prices. You can't go wrong with at least giving it a shot. Let's just hope they add those not-silly things, really.edit: Unsurprisingly, I was downvoted, because the community wants their blood. Also unsurprisingly, people still can't accept the fact that this was never supposed to be released on PC, and that it was only done so to shut those exact people up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
