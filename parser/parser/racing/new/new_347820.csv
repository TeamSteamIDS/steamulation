												This is a love letter to GTAII, and any game that involves little thought and many, many explosions. What isn't there to love about explosions, gratuitous violence, and car chases. In all those aspects this game accomplishes those things, unfortunately there are a couple of fundamental flaws that hold this game back from being a great game. Simply put, no one is playing it. Street Arena is solely based off the idea of multiplayer, involving game modes like free-for-all and capture the flag, but there is no single player campaign. There are some cop bots but that's about it.I am getting ahead myself though. When you first load up the game you are greeted by an unappealing start up screen. This screen is where you either host or connect to other games. This entire system feels rather clunky and very unpolished, but it gets the job done. There are quite a few options available from graphical, to rebindable keys, however, messing with things like resolution did cause the game to crash for me. From this screen you finally load into the actual game. It loads up all its assets and textures and loads you into another lobby. From here you finally hit join game and get to play.Here is where the game shines, you spawn in and proceed to rain chaos on everything around you. Weapons are littered about the level, ranging from pistols to rocket launchers. To collect these all you simply have to do is walk or drive through them. You can steal any car with a click of a button and then proceed to do drive-bys and any other chaotic thought that pops into your mind. The controls are fairly simplistic and an explanation shoots across your screen every time you respawn. Just about anybody can just drop in and start having fun with Street Arena. With a group of friends this game would excel, all the tools are there for you to have fun, but sadly, no one is playing. If people were playing there are multiple game modes to enjoy, such as 1v1 or Hunt, where you track down one particular player for points. Unfortunately, I spent my time just driving around and killing cops and goofing off. This quickly became dull and I lost interest.Graphically the game is simple, but ideal. You can tell that things like people in the street have little to to no detail but cars and buildings are detailed enough. Explosions have a nice feel to them and bullets zing and cars screech in expected fashion. The graphics/interface, just like the start up menu get the job done, even if they aren't the prettiest thing in the world. The level design is fairly simplistic and lends itself to the varied game modes. One thing that is slightly off putting was the games use of foul language for absolutely no reason. Screaming f****d at you when you die, which isn't funny or shocking, but annoying. Needless to say, this isn't a kid friendly game.As this is solely multiplayer game, things like story, replay value, and game length are completely dependent on the player. You could enjoy Street Arena for an hour or up to 80 hours. It really depends on how much you enjoy blowing things up. One thing the game does boast is a map editor. While this isn't visibly present anywhere on the start up menu, I digged into the Steam folder, and found it. This seemed slightly silly, but you can create your own maps for you to enjoy and share with your friends.One thing the game does have is a wide music track. Well, when you get in a car anyways. Multiple radio stations are there for you flip through ranging from rock, country, to pop. I couldn't exactly comment to the number of tracks but it's nice to have those options present as you drive around the map killing everything in sight. I haven't heard of any of songs in the game but then again I am not a music savant.While the game does have a few technical hang ups, everything works fairly well when it does finally load. The only problem I feel is that this game doesn't really offer enough to keep a player hooked, since it has no single player campaign and the gameplay is completely based off its multiplayer. It ends up feeling hollow and the fun grows thin. Other Indie games like Retro City Rampage offer this type of gameplay and have a single player campaign. It's not super innovative either when it's triple A counterpart offers this and more in oodles. Street Arena however is a fraction of the price compared to it's triple A inspiration, at $6.99. This does make it fairly easy to get your hands on and enjoy. To wrap up, this is solely a game you can enjoy with friends. So if you plan on getting Street Arena, make sure to have a friend buy it too.			",409,162,2,62,49,2,32

												Street Arena's out today. It reminds me alot of 'GTA 2' with the addition of multiplayer to add to the craziness. Looks like we've got some old school online destruction & chaos happening here!			",230,49,14,14,69,3,11

												Hello Internetpeople,This game reminds me of the glory days of playing GTA 1 & 2 multiplayer.Please keep in mind, its nothing but multiplayer online. So don't go and expect anything else.The action itself feels a bit lacking, even if the sound when picking up a new weapon is hilarious. ""SUBMACHINE GUN"" - ""AMERICAN RIFLE"" - ""AY KAY FORTY SEVEN"" etc.The car physics feels... off. And lacks most of the important aspects when it comes to drive a car, a wheel. Also, don't even try playing this game with a joypad, you need a mouse and keyboard for this. Also pretty terrible loadingtimes.I recommend playing this game by hosting a server yourself, those i tried joining with a ping of 200+ where UNPLAYABLE.Its not a particular good game, its not all trash either. Its mediocre.4/10. Close but no ci-car.			",1218,387,49,136,106,12,150

												I played this game when it was still in beta and was called Greedy Car Thieves. Back then it was quite buggy but really had potention to be a great game. So when I found this one on Steam I installed it right away. Not too expensive, and with the rebranded final version they certainly would have polished the game. Cool!... but ...no. The game is still really cool to see and play IF it works but the controls with the mouse are not yet optimized, there are several bugs in the controls and the game itself. For example after minimizing to windows you only get a black screen when returning to the game. Tested on 2 machines.Also the settings menu is really basis and there are not a lot of maps where you can play. I also encountered several times when your character becomes uncontrollable and the screen keeps flickering. Would I recommend this game? Yes, it would be great IF the developers took some effort to fix the bugs and put some attention to it. Right now it's just way too unpolished and a waste of money. Don't buy it unless the developers have updated it to newer versions than this one!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												GTA2 Tribute. Loved the game, but needs to be polished. A lot of server errors when hosting or joining. In my opinion the controls are a bit tricky to master. They're too sensible.			",1468,420,125,86,261,21,172

												Bad controls for both K&M and controllerLimited resolutions.Have to manually fix errors just to get the game workingClumsy animations.NO ONE playing, and trying a local host just created more errors.  Sometimes you CAN judge a game within a few minutes of playing.   Move along sir, nothing to see here.			",3802,1512,155,401,554,52,574

												This is basicly what GTA 1 & 2 would look like if there was multiplayer at it's time.Good concept, but sound effects, car handling and some other stuff isn't good as it should've been done.Police can hunt you down and you're ""♥♥♥♥ed"" when you jump into the water, with car or on foot.For it's current price I don't think it's worth it.
