												Momentum, Momentum, Momentum!Action Henk is a racing platformer developed by RageSquid studios which recently left Early Access. In Action Henk you play as Henk, obviously, an out of shape 90s action hero trying to defeat his nemesis Kentony! Run, jump, slide and wall jump your way to victory with one of the five playable characters. Action Henk's gameplay is sort of like Speedrunners meets the Trials series, I'd describe it as Trials without the bikes.+Nice graphics+Hilariously imagined characters+Fun gameplay, it really has the ""one more try for gold"" feel to it+Some great references throughout ranging from Thunderbirds, to MIB to the Sanic meme+Over 70 tracks (not to mention all of the community made ones)+Five playable characters, each with different skins to unlock+Great soundtrack+Lots of replayability, especially if you want to have a gold medal for each map+A good level editor+A fun hookshot mechanic which is introduced later in the game+Difficulty increases at a good rate+Great controls (I played with KB&M)+After completing a level you can challenge your friends to try and beat your time +Friendly devs-At some parts in later levels it can be difficult to know what you're supposed to do unless you watch how the ghost does it firstVerdict:9Action Henk is an absolutely fantastic racing platformer with nice graphics, great characters, addictive gameplay and loads of levels to play. If you're a fan of Speedrunners or trials this is an absolute must buy!***This review was written using a key provided by the Developers for review purposes***El K.			",670,170,24,76,100,6,76

												This is honestly one of the most amazing games I have ever played.GAMEPLAY:It's a perfect example of how the principle ""easy to learn, hard to master"" should be implemented into a game. It only has a very limited amount of controls, only run, jump, reset (to start or checkpoint) and, in some levels, hook. That means you don't have to remember much. Finishing the track at all isn't hard at all (excluding the very last set of levels). But getting a time good enough to beat the gold medal (for beginners) or the rainbow medal (for more advanced players) gets very hard very soon. And even IF you manage to beat all normal tracks with the rainbow medal, defeat all your opponents in challenges and collect all the coins of the bonus levels in time, that doesn't mean that the game doesn't offer anything anymore. There is still an online multiplayer to play with friends or meet new ones. You can build your own tracks or play some of other members of the community. You can try to further improve your time on tracks to reduce your combined time of all tracks to get a better rank on the global leaderboard, or to get a top 10 time on a track, or maybe even a world record. Once you master all the little mechanics that might be hard to pull off, but save you alot of momentum and time when done correctly, you can spend countless hours grinding levels to get a better time. And when you think you got everything done, then someone finds a new mechanic, a new route or a skip, and it starts all over again.COMMUNITY:The members of the community are all awesome people. Never have I found people that are more friendly than the Action Henk community in any game. Once you reach a certain level of play, and you get in touch with some of the higher ranked members, you get tips and tricks on how to get better times pretty much daily. On top of that, the developers are extremly supportive in every possible way and really try to give everyone the best possible experience. I've never seen devs so nice anywhere (thanks for the awesome time at Gamescom while I'm at it <3)! WHAT IS BAD?Sadly, multiplayer is pretty empty most of the time, but that's not the game's fault. Also, if you are not into grinding, doing stuff over and over again until it's perfect than the game doesn't offer much to you after a while. SHOULD I BUY IT?If you are impatient, get upset easily and can't stand doing stuff over and over again, then it's questionable. Getting the rainbow medal everywhere is certainly not easy and will take quite a long time, so if you only want to go for completion, this game offers you probably between 30 and 60 hours of gameplay, depending on how good you are. If you like getting stuff as perfect as possible and if you are a competitive person, then this game offers you at least 200 hours of gameplay, but probably more, as more routes and strats are getting found weekly. For the little price of this game you get more gameplay than in alot of AAA titles that cost 4 times as much, so I would definatly say: Buy it!			",80,13,1,9,7,1,4

												This game started as a friend coming over to my house on release day and literally forcing me to purchase it, to that night spending 8 hours taking turns with the controller beating each others times. After rainbowing all of the original levels I fell away from it for a few months. Then with the introduction of the new levels and multiplayer I have not been able to stop playing this game! I'm now in the top ten and have a WR on a level and have no intentions of stopping as there is so much I can do and play.The multiplayer is perfectly done, you can chat, throw in a taunt and see what others are doing. If you were good enough then you can gloat from the podium. I haven't even mentioned the level editor that allows you to make your own levels that are downright devious or just flat out fun!The level designs are fun, yet challenging. The earlier levels are easy to play hard to master, and the later levels are just plain challenging. It is vibrant with lots of colors great animations and environments, and tons of amazing eastereggs. The developers of this game obviously made it as a passion project. It is a hotwheels meets speedrunners and is just incredible. BUY THIS GAME! It is the next huge indie game IMO and these devs deserve every penny!			",46,8,2,6,14,1,1

								Imagine if you took the Trials series and replaced the bikes with a fat man who likes to slide around on his ♥♥♥♥. That's essentially Action Henk - it's a speedrunning, bum-sliding racer, in which you attempt to reach the end of each level as quickly as possible to beat all your friends' times online. I've been playing the alpha builds of this game for a long time now, since it was only 3 levels, and I've had an absolute blast with it. Definitely worth picking up, especially if you like to battle with friends' times online. Here's my quick video playthrough:

								Best butt-slides. 10/10Seriously, this is an amazing momentum-based platforming/speedrunning game. Simple but tweaked-to-perfection physics allow for super elaborate movements, where how you approach every jump and every millisecond really matters.It feels great to master new tiny details that allow you to shave time off your score. Just nails that ""try again and do even better"" vibe. Also looks and sounds great, cool demoscene tunes & a great ""action-figures-but-20-years-later"" aesthetic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The graphic's really suit this style of game and the 2 character's that are available at the moment ""HENK"" and ""BETSY"" are both well animated and you really do feel like you are playing as an action toy running round an obstacle course in some child's bedroom.The sound's and music in game are great and even though the main tune play's a lot whilst your racing it never does what a lot of repetitive tune's do,""GET ON YOUR BLOODY NERVES"" and actually you will find yourself humming along to the music as you try to best your (or a friends) time for that course.The gameplay is very simplistic and this works in the game's favour,as making this game complicated would have taken away from all the fun you get from racing round at break neck speed's trying to better your time or get that elusive ""GOLD MEDAL"" (i have nearly got all the GOLD'S i can get and only 1 eludes me and trust me ""OH HELL,MUMMY"" that track is so hard as to be near impossible-until you work it out).You do earn extra outfit's as you play and unlock them (and this can be done by beating other racer's or completing certain other objectives).

												Action Henk is a Trails-like racing runner where you play as an action figure named Henk. The story really isn't important, the game shines in its gameplay. Graphically the game is pretty 'eh' with its pretty low res textures, but the backgrounds are full of references and nice enough to where its not really a big deal that the characters, up close look pretty gross. There are over 50 different racing tracks to challenge yourself on if your looking for gold or rainbow badges. The other 2 levels, bronze and silver, are super simple and if you have any exprience with this type of game you'll have no problem beating them. The game really shines when racing against ghosts of your friends or gold-level ghosts or higher. The momentum in the game feels really solid so I don't really have any complaints there, except with the hook. It feels very weighty to me, so its harder to get used to. It works alright, its not horrible, but its definitely not on the level of something like speedrunners when it comes to its hook mechanics, but it does have strong momentum mechanics otherwise. The different boss levels are challenging and change things up a bit from the basic levels, as do the coin collection bonus levels you unlock after beating an areas boss. There is a lot to do in this game without even mentioning its steam workshop support with several different expert levels made by the community.Overall Action Henk is a great Runner with very well done momentum mechanics, Highly recommended. This game is super underrated In my opinion, its like it got overlooked by some of the other great titles released around its time. But if your into games like Trails or Bit Trip Runner, you need to give Action Henk a shot. Wait For A Sale  ",404,95,7,66,41,4,42

			Action Henk: Early Impressions Video created on version: Pre-Alpha ver.6 We take an early look into ""Action Henk"", and indie speed running game.		

Above is my impressions video on Action HenkAction Henk is a colorful and vibrant speed running game, that has an emphasis on momentum and um... butt sliding? It features some creative level design, collectible outfits, and action figures. Action Henk is a pretty good looking game, though in it's current stage of development the environment seems to be over used a little much. Though the game is fun, and certainly feels unique, it can get a little repetitive at times. Hopfully as the game progress through the early access cycles, more variety in both game play, and visuals will come.Overall Action Henk is a fun, light romp, with some pretty decent aesthetics to boot.Not bad, not bad at all.Pros:- When you gain momentum, the game feels as fast as it's promoted to be- Simple, but some how deep and challenging game play- Great character models and design- Has a lot of potential to grow into some thing really interestingCons:- Music is incredibly repetitive- Game play can feel repetitive after a while- Feels incomplete (Mainly because it's in early access, but this is worth noting for the time being)			",1483,525,23,180,133,13,163

												Action Henk charmed me from the word go grabbing me with a great art style and wonderful premise. You play as an Action Henk action figure who might be just a little bit past his prime, yeah he's put on a few pounds since his glory days but he's still every bit as great as he used to be. Right?Let's hope so because the nefarious Dr. Kentony has just stolen Henk's prized 'Toy of the Year' trophy and Henk's gonna have to run, jump and buttslide his way across 70+ courses to get it back!This game starts with a simple time trial gameplay mechanic and resists over complicating it with too many bells and whistles. Solid controls, well designed courses, functional multiplayer, decent humor, and a wonderful visual style all combine to make Action Henk one of my favorite releases from 2015.If you'd like to see some gameplay and hear my extended thoughts check out the video below:

												As i have only put a few hours into it i have found that everything about this game is outstanding as long as your name isn't nick. 1st off- the sound is outstanding. the different sound track alone make the game easy to play for hours2nd - the levels at the end are alright, they could should be a little harder, after you play through them maybe 5 times there just no challenge left unless your name is nick3rd - this game has a wonderful community and the dev's are always willing to help you with any problem you might have and fix any glitches that you find. everyone is friendly and playful and as long as you are willing to put forth the effort it can be competitive unless you can't take the fact that everyone is always striving to git gud then you better just stop with the main levels and build some for a while nick4th - there is no end to gaining world records on levels, i would get one and the next day someone would beat it and i would have another challenge to look forward to nick5th - the dev's did an amazing job with design and sound and mechanics, the feeling of making it smoothly through a level just feels great, there are a few glitches that could not have been forseen but they are already being worked on6th - although some have found a way to cheat the mechanics nick, most people play fair and still do better which make the people who do cheat madder nick.all in all the is probably the best game i have bought in my entire life, i would still probably recommend this game even if it was 60$ (not suggesting that). if you ever want help with it add me and i will make sure you learn to enjoy the game and not just hate it for the people that try to ruin nick. or the people that spend .1 hours on it and say its a boring game.in no way is this game boring if you love to go fast.

												Action Henk is a fun casual game that should appeal to gamers of all ages. The premise is simple. The game is a series of ""race"" tracks where you're racing against the clock or against other people in the multiplayer modes. If you've ever played a game from the Joe Danger series or to a lesser extent in terms of comparison, the Trials series, you'll have an idea of what Action Henk is all about. Another game I found it easy to compare is the Bit Trip Runner series. Basically every course is based on simple physics, speed and momentum. Your goal is to finish the track in the fastest time. There is a good deal of variety throughout the courses, with your buttslide and grappling hook coming into play at various times. You'll have to learn to time your jumps and nuances of particular courses to get the fastest time.Pros:+ Very fun graphically. This game doesnt take itself seriously.+ Variety of tracks.+ Friends leaderboard.+ Steam Workshop support. Create your own tracks!+ Wide range of courses that unlock after a certain amount of medals in the section prior.+ ""Ghosts"" and replays to see where you messed up or how to tackle a tough obstacle.Cons:- The music is abysmal. All in all, Action Henk is a good entry into this genre of game. It encourages competition, but at the same time keeps it light and fun. The track creator is fairly robust and hopefully Workshop support will encourage people to make new and even better tracks.I recommend Action Henk if you are looking for a fun game with a competitive spirit.

												At first, Action Henk looks like a small, simple game, the type that you would play maybe once or twice a week if you got bored. But there's just something about it which just makes you want to play it more and more. This is a very addictive platform speedrunner that encourages you to get the best times possible, matching you up against bronze, silver, gold and even rainbow AI 'ghosts', to play against. You can learn from the ghosts and get better at the game, you can race your friends live on online multiplayer or try to beat their best time. Local multiplayer is also an excellent feature as you can simply gather some friends around (when you have nothing else to do!) and see who is the fastest of them all. This game is very fun to play when you get into it, and there is a huge online Henk community building up. There's a steam group, a discord server and a speedrun.com site that I would strongly recommend if you have gotten all the rainbow medals and are looking for something else to do. Basically, this game is amazing and I love it. What would I say about Action Henk in general? Well... let's just say, I used to play other games.			",18,2,0,0,0,1,2

												This game is basically Sonic 1 meets something akin to Trackmania.It's a race to get the fastest time in the levels to gain medals and progress. The game doesn't have the most mechanics, mostly consisting of the track its self, sliding and occasionally a hook shot, It starts off relatively simple and it gets much, MUCH harder as you go through the game, all while listening to a fantastic heart pumping soundtrack.There are 10 zones in the game with 9 different themes, starting off with the easy going early worlds, and ending with face paced levels that will test you, and you will fail, many times.As you go you will unlock more characters to play as (6 in total), you unlock them by doing their challenge at the end of each world, the later ones are instead different costumes for the characters which you can unlock and use yourself. Getting all golds in a world will also grant access to a bonus level of which you must pass by finding the most efficient way of going around the track while collecting gold medals to unlock more skins for each character. Some skins are also unlocked through achievements.Despite all that there are some flaws.-No re-bindable controls (at time of writing)-Tricks that are nearly necessary in the later worlds are often taught though random loading screen tips (using the ghosts as a example can be hard to follow let alone watch without these tricks)-The physics can feel a bit floaty at times, especially on the grappling hook-Crashes a fair amount during multiplayer (atleast on my side)Despite all this, the game is fantastic and is great fun to play and is constantly challenging you throughout the many worlds and I'd highly recommend it if you're into this type of game.

+ The gameplay is fairly simple, but a load of fun. You are race to the finish along hotwheels tracks. You can jump and slide down slopes to increase your speed, and later on unlock new mechanics like a grappling hook.+ Extremely detailed environments that are filled to the brim with delightful nostalgic 90's items (Truly amazing)+ The level design is fantastic. Each level is pretty short, but later on they are filled with high flying jumps, flips, and turns, as you race around the room. The camera does a great job at smoothly following the character+ Steam Workshop and a Level Editor!+ Fantastic upbeat music+ Easy to learn and very precise controls+ High replayability with Leaderboards+ Unlockable characters and outfits- I felt like the game got a bit too difficult early on. It would have been nice to have seen more casual levels. This is mainly an issue because you must earn a certain number of medals to unlock new areas / levels.- Some of the levels have ""leaps of faiths"" meaning that due to the camera angle it's very hard to see when a jump is coming up which sometimes leads to unfair deaths.

												Ubisoft's Trials with much less trolling and better pacing.Run, jump and glide through a 2.5D track with hills, ramps and loops that become harder and harder...and harder. Easy to get into, with some end content that's borderline sadistic. Fun for all.			",1349,442,54,174,177,24,216

												Action Henk is an indie racing platformer developed by RageSquid.  You play as Action Henk, a 90’s action figure who has let himself go a little bit over the years. It is your job to race against other action figures to prove that you are the best toy – I mean action figureThe first thing that pulled me into playing Action Henk is that it had a similar gameplay style to Sonic and SpeedRunners, both games that I love. Action Henk does not disappoint in this aspect, if you like Sonic and/or Speedrunners, get Action Henk right now!  In Action Hank the aim of the game is to gain as much momentum as you can to get through the track in as best of a time as you can (although you do need to beat certain times to get a bronze, silver or gold medal) You run, jump and skid through the Hot Wheels esque track to reach the finish line. In later levels you are given a grappling hook style power-up which you use to swing through some of the track. The grappling hook is the old extra power-up you can get in this game, it is a very fun tool to use, but the game feels like many other power ups could have been included to change up how you play.There are 9 different themed zones, each with 5 levels and an extra boss level. Each theme looks vastly different from each other and it is a lovely change of environment when you have just spent the past 100 deaths on the previous level. Each theme also has it’s own music, so you will not grow tired of the same song throughout the entirety of the game. The finishing boss battles are a race against another action figure, in this mode you do not try and beat a set time for a medal, you just need to beat the opponent (but your scores are recorded on a leaderboard, so getting a great time is always a good thing to strive for)Action Henk has ghosts. Not the haunting, poltergeist kind, the helpful kind that gives you something to race against. You;ve seen them before, they are a semi-transparent character that run through the track to give you someone to race. The great thing about these ghosts is that they are customisable- you can race against the par time for bronze, silver or gold medal, so you know that if you beat the ghost, you earned the medal for whichever ghost you were racing. You can also race against your friends ghost (their best time) or your best time. You can even switch off ghosts completely. You also have the option to view the leaderboards for the world and watch an action replay of other people, however, you cannot seem to be able to race against their ghosts – which although I will never be able to beat them, it would have been a nice addition.I found the progression of each level to be a little strange. The game starts off quite easy and remains quite easy up until the end, and then suddenly it seems to introduce new mechanics that I didn’t know how to do. Luckily I was able to watch someone else’s replay on the leaderboards to find out how to do it.  (on the last theme there was this triple jump back-flip thing you have to do, which took me forever) I would have preferred a more stacked progression i.e. starting off easy, getting a bit hard, bit harder, hard, very hard.Once you complete all the levels, which shouldn’t take you long (unless you go for gold on each level) then you may be bored playing this game. Actually, you won’t at all – this game has Workshop support with a built in map maker! At the time of writing this review, there are currently 207 custom user-made maps which will keep you entertained for a VERY long time. You can even try and make your own track!Action Henk also includes a multiplayer feature, although I could never find another player to have a game with. There was 1 lobby open, but the person seemed to be away from their computer, so I easily beat them and got the achievement. It could have just been an off day, but at the time of writing there is currently 1 lobby open with 1 person  -so maybe an off week? However, if you get a group of friends to play this with, it will be a blast, great party game!Currently on Steam for £10.99, it is a little pricey when shown next to a similar game, Speedrunners (currently £6.99) but I still think the game is worth that price. Action Henk has wonderful graphics and the environmental scenery looks great. The music is catchy and since it changes style on each zone, you will not grow tired of it. It is a very fast paced, fun game and I’m sure that if you get it, you will have a blast. You can even grab a slightly discounted double pack to play with a friend! (or they can buy it themselves, the cheap b****rds) Full Disclosure: We were given a copy of the game to be able to complete our review. This did not have an impact on our views of the game, nor did it have an impact on the review itself.For more reviews, visit https://www.ordinarygamer.co.uk ",706,258,17,80,110,11,86

												This game is great. This game is where Sonic should have gone after the Genisis games. The controls are tight and handle very well. Levels are well designed and offer many little ways to get faster.As you play you learn new things and little tricks to get faster making it have a high replay value especially for those people who love to climb a leaderboard.I enjoyed the music as well as the look and feel of the game even the setting of being in a childs room as his out of shape action figure. It gives it almost a Toy Story feel. (almost feel like Action Henk should show up in a Toy Story sequal lol)Definatly would recomend this game to Sonic fans, people who enjoy running games, and anyone who loves climbing the score board.

								This is one of those games, where there's just not a right time to stop playing. You always need JUST ONE more try - then you miss a jump only by milliseconds, and imediately hit the retry button! I ended up spending well above an hour on one level alone. This would normally drive me mad, but since each level is relatively short/fast, you don't get the same level of agony as the Classic platformers where a restart would easily cost you 10 minutes.The sense of speed is great, the physics and game mechanics is really amazing, and I particularly like the way the sucktion cup Works and feels. After more than 3 hours of playing, I still have levels to complete, and there's even more levels to come soon. So I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone that likes a fast paced game, that also requires learning and skills, and offers a hilarious and surreal twist to childhood memories as you race through the levels. Graphics are well polished, the tech Works flawlessly and the music suits the game really nice, too. Oh, and: I MADE IT TO TOP-10 ON HOOK MAZE! :D			",3,0,0,0,0,0,6

												Ready..... GO!Ready..... GO!Ready..... GO!I really enjoyed playing this game. It is one of the best runner games I have ever played. Both multiplayer and solo modes are done really well. The levels are creative and extremely varied. Difficulty slowly ramps up as you progress through the worlds, helping you to become more effective with your running, buttsliding, and jumping.  Some of the later levels are incredibly difficult, more so when you can't even tell where you're supposed to go, but it feels great when you finally earn a medal.My biggest complaint about the game is that after 10 hours of running I still can't seem to understand how the physics engine works. I feel like I do the same thing over and over again but get a different result each time. This makes several of the later puzzles extremely frustrating as you will constantly have to restart when your runner does something other than what you intended.I definitely recommend this game.  It's quick to learn, very challenging to master.Ready..... GO!I think I've heard that about 9000 times now. ",261,95,7,15,27,2,18

								Speed runner meets platfomer with a heavy focus on physics. While it doesn't have the technical mastery of the Trials series, it's still satisfying to maximize your speed and positioning to beat the times while having enough options open to the player to keep improving. Level editor and playing against friend ghosts are the icing on the cake.			",563,185,8,90,81,5,113

								What do you get when you mix something like Trials and surf, the mod for counter strike? Action Henk! Not only are the controls smooth and intuitive but the momentum is palpable. This fatman moves as well as you would expect from gameplay videos, he handles like a dream. Don't expect many levels or challenges yet, though; the game is in a really early stage and the content is scarce. And though I hope for more interesting elements in the tracks, it seems much is to be done.The two problems I have with this game lay within the setting, which I find a bit confusing (how does a toy get overweight? who is making all these tracks? is the toy alive? maybe it doesn't matter), and the art direction. The character designs so far are terrible. And I wouldn't complain about them if I didn't know better, they could be having so much more fun with toy designs! Action Henk himself is not half bad but Betsy, oh god, she's an abomination from Hell. The environment is ok but, like I said before, I hope they start including better elements related to toys and more interactive tracks.Overall, I'm glad I bought it, it's fun, it's energetic. Much like surf, it is a thrill to play right. Don't blow this one, developers.			",130,42,0,7,6,2,13

												On the whole, I like the concept behind this game, and the mechanics. There's a heavy focus on flow and momentum, very curvy level designs that let you build up a lot of speed, and multiple paths you can access for performing better. The bronze/silver/gold/rainbow medal challengs are also a nice touch, catering to different skill levels. Personally I am a gold medal and never rainbow medal type of player, though rainbow medal is basically near-perfection that I can't be bothered with. The game also looks great, the aesthetic is superb and seeing all the pieces of level you ran over in the curvng backgrounds is really neat.I just can't really stand the game in its last levels, though... takes out all the flow and replaces it with awkward precise jumps that you can't differentiate from in the slightest unless you want to die. And die you will, it replaces any sense of skill with mindless trial and error that gets painful pretty quick. The last bonus level, also... whoever designed that should be fired. The world 10 race should prooobably be a bit more lenient, as well, and The Way of the Ninja is one of the worst-designed levels I've ever seen, but, ehh, I digress. On the whole the game is fine.One other thing that continues to bother me though is the springs. I guess they're supposed to incorporate some degree of momentum-based bouncing, too? But I only ever found them horribly inconsistent and annoying. Minor gripe though.Can't really say I love the game, especially with the last world, but on the whole I like it. I'm not sure it's worth $15 though, unless you really like replaying levels, a lot.			",279,227,3,13,13,4,26

												If Nintendo released this people would be like ""oh meh gawd, best game evar"", it would be heralded as a return to form, the game is that good. In the absence of any HYPE, 135 positive Steam reviews and 2 obligatory negative, played for 5 minutes / ""joke"" reviews pretty much sum up how good this game is. There are no half measures, everyone that played it doesn't like it, they LOVE it. The rest are too engaged in the game to write a review.I have a few games in my library which could be compared to it, Speedrunners would be one, Trials Fusion would be the other. Action Henk fills glaring gaps that exist in both these games. As well as having multiplayer it's enjoyable in singleplayer as a leaderboard game. The tracks are fun, the visuals are quirky and for something which looks so simple the game mechanics are completely unique with a devilish skills gap the reason why singleplayer and leaderboarding are so addictive.I can't recommend the game enough.

								Fast paced and packed with features I wish every game included. Absolutely recommend if you'd enjoy sort of Sonicesque platforming with more momentum and the time trial features of Track Mania rolled into a bunch of toybox themed fun.The realtime FPS counter in the options menu is a brilliant feature.

												cute and entertaining runner game (or is it a first person platformer)- cute graphics, looks good (even on a big flatscreen)- tight controls (and you will need them)- short levels that really really look good (very entertaining)- lot of levels, so you will have a looooot of hours to play.- very kid friendly.- 4 player multiplayerSimilar to the game speedrunners differences:- action henk is only about running, jumping and sliding (speedrunners has a few weapons)- ah looks way better and is funnier- both games are very good, I would say action henk is more about fun and focussed on slightly younger gamers and speedrunner is more for slightly older players... but i can be wrong about that ;)			",463,85,16,58,30,6,58

								Early Access played at 7-18-14, will update later.So far, Action Henk is a fast, satisfying time trials game that's basically Levelord does Trials. There isn't a ton of content here yet, but what's available is polished and fun - aside from the too few available levels, it feels rather complete. With new levels, scenery, playable characters, and unlockable skins in the works, Action Henk will someday offer huge value. I'm excited to sink my teeth into the promised level editor and make the fun crazy Hot Wheels tracks I never got to make as a child. My recommendation?

Input feels like it's instant and I've never been annoyed at not getting a gold medal because my input hasn't been handled correctly, instead I know it's because I screwed up a certain section of the track.I also have to say the level design so far has been really, really good and they've nailed the whole theme of toys running on a matchbox tracks setup in crazy designs.

								It's still in early stages, but it's a LOT of fun!  My kids (6 and 3) love playing it with me.  You can use the keyboard or a gamepad, or both together. I let them help play by doing jumps or sliding, while I do the rest of the actions. I've played through the first 15 or so levels and unlocked a new character and a few skins so far. It's definitely worth the price.			",184,43,8,23,18,3,23

Early Access Review
								One of the best games representing Early Access, honestly. It's definitely still being actively developed, but the core structure is all there and it's all great. The momentum system is very reminiscent of the 2D Sonic games, but the emphasis here is less on precision platforming and more on maintaining that momentum through the fast-paced levels.You have a jump button and a slide button that makes you gain speed on slopes or other downward surfaces. It seems simple, but it gives way for a lot of little complexities; you can jump onto slopes to sacrifice speed early on but gain more in the long run, jump-boost off of slopes to gain a brief burst of speed in exchange for your momentum, etc. Though pro players have already optimized most of the easier levels, there's still room for creativity to get the best possible times.There's a few level-specific mechanics, like a grappling hook that functions similarly to the one in SpeedRunners. But for the most part, it's very focused on mastering the main mechanics, which I think is a good way to go. The game feel is sharpened to a razor sheen and it shows. The inclusion of ghosts to race against and an instant level reset button are fantastic features to foster a speedrunning community.The style might be a little divisive, but I think it's pretty rad. 80s/90s-era action figures racing on tracks made from your usual construction materials; wood blocks, Hot Wheels tracks, that sort of thing. The action figures themselves are, for lack of a better term, butt-ugly. Which is clearly what they're going for here, so I commend them on the unique choice of character style.Action Henk is pretty clearly tailored toward the speedrunning community, since you'll burn through most of the levels in an afternoon if you're not looking to get all the medals or compete for the best times. But I still think you'll have a good time with it either way, if you love platformers with a big focus on speed like I do.			",451,117,11,51,20,3,36

It's a shame the devs had to move on to other projects to keep the money flowing, but even with no future updates in sight, the asking price for this game is absolutely worth it.

												See? This is why i love indie games! because they create new things, mechanics, gameplay. Asctetically pleasing beautiful game based on momentum, like trials. But with action figures! Story is simple, and fits for this game. Its minimalistic really, but it doesn't hurt the game to have a little explanation behind why are you doing what you're doing.The levels are cleverly designed, my only flaw with this game is the achievements. Well, lets just say they are absurdly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, if you dont believe me, check it.Edit: There is an achievement to ragequit during a level. Genius.			",187,43,7,10,14,6,19

												Getting back into shape has never been so fun!Action Henk is a race against the clock platforming timed racing game. You star as Henk (not Hank) who appears to be a washed up hero of sorts within a toy-based world. Very similar to Toy Story, various action figures from what looks to be the 90’s, become animated and Henk, once a fit beefcake, is now a bit out of shape, overweight and slow. So its up to his fellow toys to get him back into shape by racing them in a series of courses.All of the courses are based inside a kid’s bedroom. They are made primarily of wooden blocks and orange plastic smooth track, mainly for downhill sliding (think Hot Wheels). They capture the imagination very well in a detailed background, from posters, to furniture, lamps, desks, etc all of which have various easter eggs to other pop culture. Also like from our childhood and the TV show Community, the floor is lava the second you fall short of a jump or simply run off an edge.The game plays very smoothly and the controls are tight and spot on as to what you would expect them to be. It is highly recommended to use a 360 controller, although it is playable with keyboard. The buttons are simple and straightforward, right and left to run, A to jump and left trigger to butt slide.You begin each stage at a starting line and with a small countdown, you dash off. You use a combination of jumps and slides primarily, although later on in the levels, they incorporate wall jumping and different path options that can only be accessed through well timed jumps. Think Sonic the Hedgehog but less danger and no stomping on enemies or losing rings/coins.The game is very fast paced and can be somewhat frustrating at times. Each stage gives you the option to earn medals for various timed finishes. For example, one stage I was stuck on the bronze medal was earned with a minimum time of 24.75 seconds, then silver at 24.50 and finally gold at 23.59. Now that separation in time looks very minimal on the surface, but it is extremely difficult to ever achieve anything better than a bronze. I had to play this particular stage at least a dozen times until I had memorized the various times when to jump and slide best to maximize Henk’s speed and momentum to get the best time. I could get 25 seconds flat almost every time, but those medals were very difficult to earn, although once I finally did, I felt very accomplished and a great sense of satisfaction.The game also features leaderboards with friends and people worldwide, you can even race against other player’s ghosts. Add a community shareable level builder and you have yourself endless combinations of butt sliding fun.I first encountered this game in the Indie Megabooth at PAX Prime 2014 and I met and talked with Kitty, the marketing director for developer RageSquid while demoing the game.Aside from my own personal downfalls, Action Henk is a very well rounded game, with unlockable characters, amazingly detailed and colorful artwork, fast paced racing action, tight controls, and overall a good time.-Mattwww.playingforcheaps.com ",21,4,0,0,2,0,4

												While the story may be a single player affair, the heart of this game shines in multiplayer. Specifically, this game is FANTASTIC for splitscreen. Get a few friends and grab a few beers and you'll be sitting there for hours, just trying to get a few more points than everyone else.- The first half of the levels feature fairly simple platforming/speedrunning mechanics. The second half of the game noticibly starts ramping up the difficulty, and you will need to hone your skills if you wish to unlock more levels.- Level designer. The level designer is simple and easy to use, and people can make some really great tracks with it. This feature definitely creates a massive amount of replay value.			",500,115,22,69,43,6,54

												I got about halfway through the visible levels (5-1 out of 8 total(?), and then realised that I had no way to interrogate what I was doing wrong. I was going slower than the gold time-trial ghost, mimicking their movements fairly precisely as well as trying some variations on other runs, and I think now that the systems in play are - while enjoyable - not properly laid out in an active tutorial for me to improve in a way that feels  organic , which is enough to deter me from continued play.

												Action Henk is a time trial game where you control a 90's action figure.You need to run, jump, grapple and buttslide through a variety of levels, racing against ghost players or just trying to beat your previous best time. The early levels are quite fun and well-designed and encourage you to play through them again and again to improve your time.Unfortunately the level design takes a huge nose dive in the last few level sets. Suddenly the focus is on extremely precise jumps and it feels like the game is much more about tedious trial and error than fun racing. The controls don't really feel precise enough for this kind of gameplay and I wasn't having fun at all anymore.Visually the game is a mixed bag. The levels themselves look decent but the character models are absolutely hideous apart from Henk himself. I wasn't a huge fan of the extremely repetitive soundtrack either.Action Henk has its moments, but it doesn't really offer anything particularly new and lacks polish. I wouldn't recommend the game unless you are a big fan of time trial games.The good:- Fun early levels- Instant restartsThe bad:- Uneven difficulty- Poorly implemented checkpoint system- Extremely repetitive music- Grappling hook controls are not very good (at least on a gamepad)- Hideous character models- Some poorly designed levels			",558,228,11,89,48,8,102

												Is Action Henk a bad game? No, not really, but still, for the asking price there isn't a lot of content or polish. A few different settings, which are ultimately the same. A new gimmick here and there (for example a swing mechanic that is only ever used in 1 setting, instead of combined in other levels). The rest is all passive...jump and slide, that's pretty much it, and hit objects at exactly the right angle and time for maximum effect. The game lacks a tutorial. New elements (apart from the grapple) are introduced without telling you how to tackle them. For example, did you know that loopings are best done sliding? You will eventually get a pre-game tip that tells you this, which is unacceptable. At least a ""how to play"" section needs to be part of the game. Other than that it's just another run of the mill runner. Joe Danger 2 is better for example if you're looking for that kind of thing. However, this also includes a level editor and online rankings, so at least you can get lots of play time out of it if you're not bored to death. I'm 2 hours in and almost done with the game. I COULD get all the gold medals to unlock more characters and get the best times, but just not what I'm primarily looking for in a game. So, pick this up during a sale for 5 bucks.I forgot to mention that the game can be unfairly hardcore at times....but I guess that's not really a fault, but a feature.			",209,55,12,41,26,3,65

												I did not get much time to play Action Henk over the free weekend, but I did manage to complete most of the courses. from what I played I have to say, Action Henk seems like a pretty great racing/ platformer ""runner"" game. Gameplay wise Action Henk puts you in control of an action figure running, jumping, sliding and even grappling through a large variety of track courses. The tracks themselves are made from building blocks and toy car track, in Action Henk everything is ""toy-scaled""! Overall I would recommend Action Henk to anyone who likes games that fall into both racing and platformer, or really anyone who is looking for a good indie game.			",374,143,14,85,57,11,89

												A fairly solid game for what it is. I had been reminising about Unirally/Uniracers for SNES and Action Henk definately the recreated similar gameplay.  Unfortunately they went down the route of needing to retry the course every time you make a mistake if you want to get a half decent time meaning much of the harder levels depend largely upon memorisation. While I enjoy the gameplay it has only taken me an hour to get up to the third to last world on silver times, at which point memorisation seems to be more necessary rather then mostly reflexes.  I have better things to do then memorise every level. Some people may enjoy it but most people do not, as evidenced by the achievement levels for this part of the game onwards. Imagine if you were playing mario kart without the randomness of other players, but every time you didn't make a corner perfectly you had to start the whole race again. Then make every corner extremely unpredictable and unforeseeable without knowing the map. Would mario kart still be as popular as it is? Perhaps an approach where multiple laps are needed would be better, so you can make some mistakes without needing to reset. As mentioned at the start Unirally/racers had 3 laps, and you could more tricks throughout to speed up when you fall behind. The controls are tight and responsive, although the wall jumping isn't floaty enough. I like the humour and design of the world which is childish and nostalgic.  The shark and lava aspects of the game are great.  The characters while fun could have more varied and funny lines.If you like perfectionist games like Trials give this a go. Otherwise maybe buy it on special and/or just get a refund when you get sick of it like me. I'd probably keep it if it had local coop multiplayer. The online appears to be dead. Maybe a local coop mode could be done where one player who falls behind can choose to teleport to the player in front and continue on where they are from, as they both try to get the best combined time? The game 'Speedrunners' is far more fun, accessible, cheaper, has better physics (Action Henk basically copied the hookshot from Speedrunners) and has excellent local and online modes. Grab that instead, or try it out if you like Action Henk.			",256,27,7,24,24,4,36

												Not a difficult game with lack of content. What to do? Force you to collect some medals to unlock more levels. If not that this game can be completed in less than hour or so. Also, time doesn't go back to moment when you activated your checkpoint, so this feature is useless considering you need to get certain score to earn those medals. There's no other mechnic different than go right, jump and slide beside hookshot which appears only in 10 levels or so. Graphics are nice and colorfull, even too colorfull for my taste. It just makes you loose concentration sometimes. Thankfully I'm not a fan of Toy Story, so I'm not falling for all the nostalgia that Action Henk tries to put throughout the game. Only hard part of the game are challanges which leave hardly any room to make mistake. For that price (14,99 euro) I'm not recommending it at all, you spend less and better money for Bit.Trip Runner which does everything better - especially with difficulty and different mechanics. I suppose Action Henk is only worth buying on sale if you really want it.			",319,76,3,43,30,4,55

and now onto the reviewTL;DR ReviewAction Henk is a fast paced, party multiplayer game where action figures race in elaborate courses in any place a kid would take their action figures.-Gameplay-1-4 multiplayer game. it's fast, it's fluid, it handles itself very well. anyone can pick up a controller and get into the flow of a game real fast-Graphics, Sound & Artstyle-Action Henk seems almost like an unnoficial Toy Story game, where some of the surroundings just feel like Andy's Room. The music while fine at first gets repetitive and annoying eventually.-Price-The retail price is 14.99 USD-How many hours estimated?-While I didn't talk about it previously, Action Henk comes with a single player campaign where you must beat time trials to get medals and advance. For casual players like myself, I found some of the courses & bosses too dificult and gave up on them almost immediately. IN MY OPINION, Singleplayer doesn't add much depth to the game and it's forte is playing local or online multiplayer with friends. I would estimate about 15-20 hours.-Buy it Now? Wait for Sale? Don't Buy?-While it is a perfectly polished game, in the market there are currently games that just give more for your buck. It's worth picking up on a sale but not at the full retail price. WAIT FOR SALE.			",484,168,10,56,55,7,57

												I like car racing games but I don't like the Sonic type running ones like Hank. That's why I could not really get into it. I'll look for something with more to do in it. This one feels far too repetitive. If timing is your thing and you don't mind doing the same thing again and again until you reach perfection then give it a shot. I think it is terribly over-priced so you should wait for a big discount from a sale. I read the good reviews here and can only laugh at how they make it seem so exciting. It's nothing like that at all for me.  You will have to unlock levels to continue to play. That type of game really irritates me but again it goes back to there isn't that much in it so they want you to play it repeatedly. I had no problems with the running of the game in Windows 10 on my laptop and used the keyboard for control. For me, this one is a pass.			",35,21,5,18,44,0,28

												Action Henk is a speedy, wonderfully nostalgic platformer in the vein of Joe Danger or Sonic the Hedgehog. Playing as a variety of eccentric toys, you’ll jump over “lava,” swing through perilous gaps and butt-slide down matchcar tracks to get the fastest time possible.If you haven't butt-slid down a disco track as a sweaty, plastic ballerina action hero...You haven't lived.I actually interviewed the dev--amazing team!

												A burglar broke into a house one night. He shined his flashlight around, looking for valuables, and when he picked up a CD player to place in his pack, a strange, disembodied voice echoed from the dark saying, ""Jesus is watching you.""He nearly jumped out of his skin, clicked his flashlight out, and froze. When he heard nothing more after a bit, he shook his head, promised himself a vacation after the next big score, then clicked the light on and began searching for more valuables. Just as he pulled the stereo out so he could disconnect the wires, clear as a bell he heard,""Jesus is watching you."" Freaked out, he shone his light around frantically, looking for the source of the voice. Finally, in the corner of the room, his flashlight beam came to rest on a parrot. ""Did you say that?"", he hissed at the parrot.""Yep,"" the parrot confessed, then squawked, ""I'm just trying to warn you.""The burglar relaxed. ""Warn me, huh? Who in the world are you?""""Moses,"" replied the bird.""Moses?"" the burglar laughed.

												This game is truly amazing. I have almost 8 hours on record and I've almost beaten the game as far as I can tell. The level design is absolutely wonderful, the characters are incredibly unique, controls are intuitive and smooth, and it's honestly quite engaging and thrilling.It plays very much like an oldschool Sonic game, just a momentum and speed based platformer, but it's a completely unique reskin with gradual challenge and interesting twists thrown in here and there.

												Action Henk is Amazing, I thouroughly enjoyed every bit of this game. With the upbeat music to the dynamic colors there are few to no flaws in the art or playstyle of this game. Action Henk was worth every penny i spent on it and I would totally reccomend any gamer who enjoys a fast paced racing game to buy this game. 10/10			",42,8,0,10,6,1,4

												This is a VERY FUN side scroller with fairly advanced physics involved. One of the things I love the most is that when you go into your video settings it will give you a hint at what your frame rate will be with each option chosen. THIS is very important if you are recording videos and want the best replay on YouTube. Love this feature!!!! Very addictive and very fun, small community but people seem to love it. I can't wait to see more with this game.			",195,41,3,33,30,2,21

												Whether you loved the Sonic games on the Genesis/Mega Drive, or Uniracer/Unirally on the SNES, or if you're a fan of Speedrunners on Steam, you will absolutely love this game too.Speed, momentum and flow are the words of the day in this 2.5D platform game, as you race through awesome levels that twist and turn, full of obstacles and difficult maneuvers. Levels start off easy enough to complete, and steadily become more challenging as you unlock more of them, with extra features and game mechanics introduced.This is not a game for those who get frustrated easily: You will fail, and fail, and fail again as you try to speed up and optimise your path, leaping over ""lava"", sliding down hills, using the hookshot to try and build momentum, and figuring out where to best jump, to run, and slide to improve your run.The amount of love that went into this game is obvious: The game has an awesome art style, with great details put into the backgrounds of the levels, and into the individual characters: Each of which has multiple outfits you can unlock - and these aren't just reskins - each outfit has been individually modelled, with a completely different theme and voice pack, and I'm fairly certain that many of them have their own character animations, with Swan Henk (a ballerina outfit for Henk, and one of the first you unlock) doing split jumps as you leap around the levels - I've not noticed others yet, but I've not had a chance to play with all of them.Anyone worried about the longevity of a speedrunning platform racer will be happy to know that there's a level editor available, which should allow for players to share their creations, and provide plenty of challenges even once you complete the main level pack. Multiplayer is also available, though I haven't had a chance to check it out yet.Basically a fantastic game, and you should definitely own this.			",630,128,18,63,53,3,84

												Toy story meets Sonic the Hedgehog in this high-octane 3D speed-running platformer dedicated to 90s nostalgia. From a basic prototype in 2013 to a highly praised Steam Early Access game, Action Henk has now finally been released upon the world in all his glory.The protagonist of the story is the titular Henk, he’s an out-of-shape beer-bellied action figure who’s past his prime but trying hard to hold on to the glory of days gone by. Unfortunately, a nefarious doctor has stolen his “Toy of the Year” award and so Henk must return to action to reclaim his title.Before I delve into the in’s and out’s of the game itself I first want to make one simple statement, this game is ridiculously fun. Built on the very simple control structure of running, jumping, butt-sliding, this game is impressively immersive, interesting and adrenalin-fuelled.The main story campaign contains more than 70 tracks, all with varying degrees of difficulty and each with their own target times. The mode plays out in a very standard way for the genre, there are three target times per level, one for bronze, one for silver, one for gold, collect medals based on your performance and these medals and then used to unlock further levels are you progress through the campaign. All in all a bulk standard approach given the type of game. Where the game excels with this genre template though is in it’s overall design, it’s clear that the game has been thought out in advance and the limitations of progression are nailed. What I mean by this is, you don’t have to gold every race in order to progress,Where the game excels with this genre template though is in it’s overall design, it’s clear that the game has been thought out in advance and the limitations of progression are nailed. What I mean by this is, you don’t have to gold every race in order to progress, Action Henk doesn’t intentionally try and hold you back, it’s new areas open up quickly and it’s fairly easy to progress through the entire campaign in hours not weeks.This may not sound like the highest priority with the game design, but it does compliment Action Henk considerably given that the game’s primary focus is speed. This approach also removes the need to grind and instead leaves you wanting to return to levels for fun rather than necessity.Once you’re done with the campaign, you don’t have to return to past levels to continue enjoying the game thanks to a level creator. Why not create your own work of insane art and share it with the world through the Steam workshop? If you’re feeling less than creative or you need a bit of inspiration then you also have the option to download track which the Steam community has created.Moving on to the gameplay itself, it’s exactly as you would expect, an interesting mix of fun and frustration. Action Henk is far from forgiving if you make even the slightest mistake and rookie players may find themselves spending hours on the first set of levels. This may be an issue for those with less than sharp reflexes, it can be incredibly painful, but master this game and you get a genuine sense of accomplishment out of it.The level designs themselves are superb, if a little nauseating at times, the fact that this game can actually inflict motion sickness is both terrifying and impressive in equal measures. Unfortunately, this does mean that Action Henk can quickly become one of those game that you only play in small chunks. This isn’t a game to dedicate hours to in one go but one that having played short term increasingly calls you back for more once you’ve freshened up somewhat.There is so much going on in each level and given the amount of levels on offer, two tracks rarely feel alike. That said many of the tracks are over in less than a minute and so gameplay comes thick and fast. As you progress though, you will begin to discover that a number of levels have multiple routes and so there is definitely a degree of replayability outside of simply wanting to beat your own score.Every inch of every track has some toy reference associated, these levels are almost entirely constructed from toys. Making up the majority of the track action are the kind of orange ramps you’d expect to get with Hot Wheels sets, throw in the wooden train tracks and blocks kids use for tower construction and you’ve got a complete track filled with many obstacles, the attention to detail is impressive.For those at the higher end of the gaming age bracket (if there is such a thing in this day and age), this game oozes nostalgia. The video game and pop culture references are abundant throughout, everything from Pokemon to Jaws gets a nod as well as a smorgasbord of the random childhood games we enjoyed in the 1990’s, there’s definitely a lot of love for the past in Action Henk, which I’m assuming also refers back to Henk’s heyday.The characters really seal the deal with this game, they each have their own unique look, personality, issues and strengths. It’s very easy in a game of this nature to provide the user with throwaway characters, at the end of the day you don’t need an in-depth storyline and a cast of unique characters to make a speed-runner but Henk proves that when you do it adds a lot value and enjoyment to an otherwise standard setup.The attention to detail, the nostalgia trip, the likeable characters, these all make up a brilliant package that is only fully realised by the stunning artwork this game has to offer. If you take a look at the video that developer RageSquid released on YouTube showing how the game has evolved over the last 18 months, you can see how much time and effort has gone into the look of the game.While the majority of the early game action takes places in the bedroom (hehe), it isn’t long before our overweight action figure is butt-sliding his way through a beach resort and later on swinging through a jungle environment. There is a great deal of differences between these environments yet each is beautifully rendered, colourful and full to the brim with life.It’s actually extremely difficult to take in everything going on in the background due to the speed at which the game play moves but every so often it’s very easy for your line of sight to wander and you will get a glimpse of something brilliant, especially on the disco levels.Complementing the visuals is the soundtrack, it’s that perfect mixture of fun, happy, yet fast-paced music, the kind of that made Sonic such an enjoyable experience (enough with the hedgehog already). It’s very easy to zone out of what’s coming out of the speakers when playing a game of this nature but playing Action Henk, I never did, it helped motivate me.Overall, Action Henk is one of the best speed-runners that has been released in a number of years. The gameplay is fun, exciting and rewarding, the visuals are easy on the eye and impressive and the audio complements the whole package, but you need to be a fan of this genre to fully appreciate the gameIt’s one downside is the balance between fun and frustration but with a little practice this game quickly turns in favor of enjoyment. This isn’t a game to play at length over many hours in one go but one to jump in and out of in small bursts for the most enjoyable results, especially if you suffer from motion sickness. If speed-runners are your thing then you will be hard-pressed not to find a reason to invest in this title.			",176,19,9,21,12,0,13

												Disclaimer: I’ve been provided a key of this game for free.  My comments are my own.Action Henk is a game where you race not only against the time but also your friends and, if you want, the Number 1 time holder.  Mind you, racing against No. 1 is hard and requires a lot of finding those small frames that give you an extra second.You can race against your friends two ways: by their recorded time or online via multiplayer.  Mind you, when I tried it the game crashed but this was when it loaded twice and I'm not sure whether to chalk that up against the game.Multiplayer is likely best played with friends or people that you can rely on being online at the same time.  The reason is that, like other indie games, there isn't a whole lot of people playing these games online(unless the statistics state otherwise.If you are looking for something fresh in racing I'd recommend checking this out.Here's my video supplementing the review:

												This games was really fun to play in early access and it's even better now. Action Henk feel really good to control and it really makes you feel like you're going fast. The levels are all designed with little things you can use to make your time a couple centiseconds shorter. This can let you play a level over and over again trying to get even close to the number one spot without it getting boring. Levels normally take about 30 seconds to complete and I've sometimes spent more than half an hour playing the same level  over and over just to get a good time. While the mechanics are really simple there is surprisingly much dept to how you're can optimize each level and it's especially fun when you find a different way to go through an area faster than the number 1.If you like platforming or speedrunning this game will not disappoint (unless your experience is different than mine I guess).Edit: I forgot to mention that the game looks dang good and the music in most levels is really good too. But you probably figured that out by watching the trailer.			",109,34,3,5,8,1,11

												Action Henk is a speedy, wonderfully nostalgic platformer in the vein of Joe Danger or Sonic the Hedgehog. Playing as a variety of eccentric toys, you’ll jump over “lava,” swing through perilous gaps and butt-slide down matchcar tracks to get the fastest time possible.If you haven't butt-slid down a disco track as a sweaty, plastic ballerina action hero...You haven't lived.I actually interviewed the dev--amazing team! Launched out of Early Access in a wave of awesome, and incorporated a ton of player feedback in the process.

												The game relies on fine tuning of jumping and sliding as its primary method of challenge and entertainment. Utilizing this obsessive behavior will only gain you fractional seconds so that achievements and characters become unlocked.Get ready to play the same level over and over and over x 100.Goofy and elegant level design, humor and minimal story heave the game along but in the end the OCD nature of play creates nothing more than a toy or phone app level of quality.Passes time, seems kid friendly and can be picked up and put down between downloading better Steam titles.

												A burglar broke into a house one night. He shined his flashlight around, looking for valuables, and when he picked up a CD player to place in his pack, a strange, disembodied voice echoed from the dark saying, ""Jesus is watching you.""He nearly jumped out of his skin, clicked his flashlight out, and froze. When he heard nothing more after a bit, he shook his head, promised himself a vacation after the next big score, then clicked the light on and began searching for more valuables. Just as he pulled the stereo out so he could disconnect the wires, clear as a bell he heard,""Jesus is watching you."" Freaked out, he shone his light around frantically, looking for the source of the voice. Finally, in the corner of the room, his flashlight beam came to rest on a parrot. ""Did you say that?"", he hissed at the parrot.""Yep,"" the parrot confessed, then squawked, ""I'm just trying to warn you.""The burglar relaxed. ""Warn me, huh? Who in the world are you?""""Moses,"" replied the bird.""Moses?"" the burglar laughed.

												This game turned out more fun then I anticipated and it was quite accidentally that I gave it a chance.In short this is a 3D side platform race runner. Your aim is to get from start to finish in the shortest time available. To do that you've got to navigate the course and use various slides, jumps, boosts and a grappling hook to your advantage. Gameplay wise it reminds a sonic game. It's fast, it's not easy but really rewarding.The environments are pretty detailed and colourful. At times I found them a bit too distracting but it's not a game breaking problem. The controls are tight, very responsive and make sense for the most part. Some slope jumps are not intuitive but you can learn them by watching the AI ghost runs. Sound design seems appropriate with the game's theme - bold, loud and cartoony.The race length is long enough too enjoy and short enough to quickly restart when you fail. Getting a gold medal on the run at certain races is really challenging. Global score sheets are really nice addition as well.This seems like a perfect fit for multiplayer although I've not tried it.Overall enjoyed the game very much. And was happy to go trough all of the tracts. Can easily recommend to any sonic fans or people liking runners with tight controls.			",354,129,6,45,29,2,52

												This was a ridiculously fun precision platformer that I enjoyed thoroughly.  I had it on my wishlist for a while to keep an eye on it, and so when there was a free weekend I immediately booted it up to try it.  It didn't disappoint, and before the free weekend was over I had nearly completed it.  So, considering I had already got my money's worth, I bought it then so that I could have more time with it.  It's been an incredibly enjoyable experience, and it's a generally well-crafted game.9.3/10			",150,41,2,8,19,1,17

												(Full disclosure: one of the devs did an internship at the company I work for.)Action Henk combines the pure speed and exhiliration of early Sonic with a challenging and highly addictive racing mechanic. Occasionally frustrating but always enjoyable, the game will have you at the edge of your seat as you try to slice those crucial few milliseconds off your final track times. When you're in the zone and your jump timings combine with your forward momentum to land you at the perfect point of an incline to perform a speed-boosting butt slide, there's simply no greater feeling in the world.

												Even though I've only played this game for two hours, I can honestly say it's one of the best new games I've played this year. Basically, this is a speedrunner's dream/nightmare come to life. You play as Henk, an old action figure who retired and got a bit of a pudge. The story is some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ named Kentony stole a trophy of yours, and you gotta get it back. Yeah, not much story, but this game doesn't need it when you GOTTA GO FAST!!! Yes, I used a dumb meme, but that's the point of the game: GOTTA GO FAST!As a young man who absolutely loathed time trials as a child (looking at you Crash Bandicoot: Warped), the fact that I'm racing against the clock to get medals doesn't discourage me in this game. If anything, the time trials actually encourage me to get better at the game. Yeah, you can say that about most games with a time trial mode, but the fast-paced nature of this game makes it fun to practice. And if you do rage-quit and hit Alt-F4 because you're too mad to do it normally, the game actually rewards you with both an achievement and an unlockable skin for one of the characters you can play as. Honestly, that was a nice, clever little thing RageSquid did there, and I approve of it.In all honesty, there aren't many games like this that come in mind other than Speedrunners, and this is basically that game, except you play as a pudgy action figure instead of a YouTuber of your choice. But still, this is a fun game, and if you got a spare 15 bucks on hand, go get this game. It's fast, fun, and damn fun to play. Take it from a guy who doesn't really love time trial games; this game is good. And you get to go FAST!!! BY BUTTSLIDING!!!!			",140,21,1,9,12,4,3

												Action Henk is an Indy racing platform like SpeedRunners but your performance is based solely upon your ability as a player without having to worry about traps set by your opponents. It's a fun game either playing by yourself or with friends. Simple concept but with some intricate control timings that will allow you to eke out a better time. Single player: Each level has 3 preset time medals to shoot for (bronze, silver, gold). The quicker the time, the better the medal. This will allow you to know how you are doing and where you're supposed to be. Also your time is record via record boards against all other players to also let you know how you stack up. Multiplayer: You're given a set amount of time to complete the course as quickly as possible. Whoever finished the course as quickly as possible wins. Simple concept, yes, but when you add in trash talking and other general ribbing against your opponents it can get pretty hilarious, pretty quickly.Overall: I'm loving this game and I see it becoming a staple game in the future for all LAN parties that I will be partaking in.

												This game is truly amazing. I have almost 8 hours on record and I've almost beaten the game as far as I can tell. The level design is absolutely wonderful, the characters are incredibly unique, controls are intuitive and smooth, and it's honestly quite engaging and thrilling.It plays very much like an oldschool Sonic game, just a momentum and speed based platformer, but it's a completely unique reskin with gradual challenge and interesting twists thrown in here and there. I plan to continue playing this game for a very long time and I am prepared to enjoy every second of it.Highly recommend this, definitely worth the purchase.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A burglar broke into a house one night. He shined his flashlight around, looking for valuables, and when he picked up a CD player to place in his pack, a strange, disembodied voice echoed from the dark saying, ""Jesus is watching you.""He nearly jumped out of his skin, clicked his flashlight out, and froze. When he heard nothing more after a bit, he shook his head, promised himself a vacation after the next big score, then clicked the light on and began searching for more valuables. Just as he pulled the stereo out so he could disconnect the wires, clear as a bell he heard,""Jesus is watching you."" Freaked out, he shone his light around frantically, looking for the source of the voice. Finally, in the corner of the room, his flashlight beam came to rest on a parrot. ""Did you say that?"", he hissed at the parrot.""Yep,"" the parrot confessed, then squawked, ""I'm just trying to warn you.""The burglar relaxed. ""Warn me, huh? Who in the world are you?""""Moses,"" replied the bird.""Moses?"" the burglar laughed. ""What kind of people would name a birdMoses?""""The kind of people that would name a Rottweiller Jesus.""-----------------Ok yes, I just wanted to give thumbs up but you have to type something to do that.
