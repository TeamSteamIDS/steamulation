												My god, I am so glad this game has finally made its way onto steam! Before I played this game, I didn't care about racing sims. When my friend showed me this game however, I fell in love. It was the game that made me want to buy a race wheel.This game is so much fun to play, the physics are great and the AI are very challenging. The thing that drew me, however, was the mods. This game has a HUUUUUGE selection of mods available, adding new cars and tracks ranging from a large number of different types. You can add movie cars, old F1 cars, dirt tracks, freaking trucks, even stupid stuff like horses and... a toilet car. Almost anything you can imagine has been modded at somepoint. I spent hours just playing just downloading mods and driving them around.So long as you can look past the slighty outdated graphics, this is a great game to buy.			",424,81,26,44,79,7,59

												I bought this game in 2005 and i've done thousands and thousands of laps driving mainly F1 cars. Even though it doesn't make proper use of the latest hardware and has dated graphics, it's still an awesome racing sim. For those people that bought the game previously and want to add it to your Steam account without buying it again, just go to http://rf1comm.rfactor.net/purchase/get_steam_key.php and enter your rFactor order number with the email address that was used when purchasing rFactor. You will then be mailed a Steam key which can then be activated on Steam as per normal.			",27,0,21,0,0,0,0

												I've had this game for years, with a ton of community mods tracks and cars.  This is one of the best ever, it's a race sim not a arcade racer.  The good:Stacks of community based addonsFully customizable race optionsBuild your own seasons with the right third party tools or a text editor24 hour real time clock with time compression multipliers. Start racing at night and finish in the afternoonVariable levels of difficulty with driving aids, AI settings and damage mulitpliersGreat mulitplayer platform (i've only tried LAN with adding AIAI cars are not great but not the worst, the cars aren't affected by damage and tyre wear the same way as a human driver.The not so good:A bit dated, I can run the graphics at full with 40 AI cars and seems to run fineNo Rain and or other weather effects. Not a biggyThere's better racing software out there, particularly for multi-player.  If you want multiplayer go Iracing it's pricey but constantly being developed and generally not a wreck fest.Season and career play seems a little un-developedIn all a classic, I spent most of my sim-driving time on Iracing but come back to this one just love the rally cross tracks available and some old classic tracks not avialable anywhere else ",46,6,3,8,10,0,13

												My review, 2015 EDITION:$20+ for a game that's 10 years old??!?  OK, a bit of a disclaimer:IF you are looking for modern graphical ""eye candy"", of course look elsewhere (Assetto Corsa, Project Cars, etc.)  No, rFactor doesn't look that great by today's standards.IF you are looking for hundreds of different cars and tracks, YES, rfactor can give that to you, mostly for free!  rFactor is possibly the greatest racing sim for *modders* of all time.  There are literally thousands of custom tracks, cars, skins, and extra goodies out there for this game and most of them won't cost you a penny... just a little time and trouble to find them and install them correctly.  ""Out of the box"" rFactor doesn't offer a whole lot.  The Lienz Festival of Speed is good fun and the other content, what there is of it, is pretty decent, but really this sim is about what you do AFTER you buy and install it.  That's where the real value lies!  Before buying this game I recommend just searching google for ""rfactor"" and see what you come up with.  Some sites in particular cater to this sim, such as www.rfactorcentral.comOthers, like www.nogripracing.com also have a ton of downloadable content for it.And if you want to do an all in one package, check out http://www.bockbierbude.de/  Just make a free account, install their python app and point it towards your rfactor install.  The app will download a huge variety of cars, skins, and tracks, while you wait, and updating them is just a couple of clicks away.Also while not all cars/mods support it I highly recommend installing a plugin called ""Realfeel"".  This will give the compatible cars force feed back (assuming you are using a wheel!) that is still top notch, even by today's standards, and arguably much better than some much newer sims and racing games.So is the $20+ price a good value?  If you are willing to do a bit of work, downloading and installing stuff, it is STILL TODAY the best value in sim racing out there!   I'm not sure any other sim is capable of fielding 100+ cars at once in a full blown ADAC/VLN challenge!  ;)			",48,1,12,4,4,0,2

												Thought I'd justify the well deserved attention it needs. It's going to be a lengthy one, but I reckon it's a worth while. Here's a quick summary of what I will write (Split between Pros and Cons). Lengthy write up below.Pros:-Many 'completed' mods-Still actively played-Customisable-Realfeel plugin (Best FFB ever), Especially with HistorX-HistorX is a must play mod - The sound in the game is FABULOUS.-Brings a smile :)-Never too old, or tiredCons:-Need to create multiple rFactor files-Complexity in dumping mods in files-Not all are match-files friendly-No more development in game-Spend HOURS getting mods to work ( On many ocassions)Recommended Mods :-HistorX Touring Cars-Honda NSX/Corvette C6-Endurance Series (EnduRacers)-GPC 1979Lengthy write up:  Yes, it's a game a decade ago. Why not get rFactor 2, GSCE, AC? By no means, I'm saying you should buy just this 1 game and ignore the rest. If you could own all of them, get all. But if you had to decide on 1, this would be it.This is literally multiple games for the price of 1. Mods like HistorX, GPC 1979, Endurance series, Honda NSX etc. In particular, games with realfeel plugin brings heaven to the game. I'd dare say particularly the HistorX mod has the best FFB in any sim. What's more they are free. No Pay-to-play DLCs. These Modders deserve the respect. Salute. This game is highly associated to Stock Car Extreme (SCE) because it uses the same engine - Gmotor. Now SCE, undoubtly, is a game that I'd say stand a fair fight. Why did I put rFactor > SCE? Purely because of the 'finished'/'completed' feel of a game. Everything in rFactor feels right. Now be cautious, this game isn't meant to be played with its based game. You are supposed to play mods with it. And I highly recommend to play with mods with ""REALFEEL PLUGIN IN MIND FROM THE START"" (as quoted by my friend). SCE is probably the most completed package as Reiza is constantly bringing new features, updates. This would be the 2 sims i'll get. Let say it this way, if you want a 'plug-and-play' game, it's SCE as I find the game fundamentally good enough that it doesn't need mods. If you want MORE FUN, rFactor. I've been in SimRacing for 8 years now. I've played rFactor, iRacing, SCE, netKar Pro, followed the development of Assetto Corsa. I was borned into rFactor, as it was my first sim. Done league races and till today, even though it's on/off, it still brings joy to me and excitement which many new titles struggle today. I've never had the surge to play the game again on the new modern titles. In conclusion, the price does sound ridiculous for a decade old game. But I still see the longevity in the game for the upcoming years. Easy to set-up dedicated host servers, MANY mods. In fact, most of the mods are the definition of the current modern sims we have today. This game is the 'Metaphor Of the All Sims' being developed today. I'd rate this game 9.99/10 (the 0.01 for the awful default cars, but see it as a perfect score ;) ) ",27,0,11,0,5,0,2

Introduction:A thrilling racing simulator that is great for any racing fan. Unique cars and tracks make this a great adition to any racing fans library. This is still a very good racing simulator many years later. The graphics and effects aren't special but it gives you a good solid racing platform that includes what you need. This game has been out for quite some time which means a lot of mods have been created that make the game so much better. If you enjoy tandem drifting or drifting this is a must have for any drift sim player. The physics make it an unparalleled experience.Pros:Good wheel support but requires quite some tweakingGreat community and pretty active player base Classic track selectionRealistic physics that create great immersionDifficulty and race environment optionsCons:Weak career or campaign modeVery difficult control setupsDeveloper made cars without modsBarely any tuning or customizationConclusion:This is definitely a solid racing simulator. With the realistic physics and good wheel support this is a great game for any racing fan, espcially with a gaming wheel. If you're looking to play online with your friends or enjoy good quality racing sims this is a great choice. For more reviews check out  Original Curators Group  ",84,12,10,9,25,1,2

												First things first, this game is old. 10 years old. Don't come expecting much in the way of graphics, you'll be disappointed. If you want graphics, go for a new sim like Assetto Corsa,Second, the base game content sucks. If you don't like modding games, don't buy this game.Third, this is damned fun. The AI is highly adaptable, I have found. None of the awkwardness of being too fast for one difficulty but too slow for the next one. The modding community is enormous, IE to scales I've only really seen beaten by Bethesda RPGs and FSX. Want F1 cars from 1982? Got that. Want Indycars from 1998? Got that too. Want Argentinian Touring Cars, Australian GT cars, or British Formula 3? It's got all that.And, despite the game being 10 years old, the modding community is still active today. Mods for this year's Formula One cars are being made, Formula E mods exist, and so on.I can tell you of some of the most fun I've had racing.2010 V8 Supercars at Zolder. The car/track combo worked ideally, and both of these mods were made by completely different teams.2011 ALMS at Sebring. Mixed class endurance racing. It's not easy, you have to negotiate through slow cars, and let fast cars through, and while racing another guy. It punishes mistakes, in a predictable way. This isn't F1 2012, it feels great.2012 Indycar at Nazareth. Close, wheel to wheel racing without any AI derps. I think this is where the AI shows what it can do the most. Despite the high speeds, the AI works very well. No sudden giving up on moves and single file racing, no jumpy over excitement that inevitably leads to a 10 car pile up, it feels (and looks) like a real race.Overall, I'd give rFactor an 8.5 out of 10. It's fun, but it's not the ultimate racing sim, at least not nowadays. Soon enough, rFactor 2 will come to Steam, and once the modding community starts doing what it does best, lets just say I have high hopes for ISI.UPDATE: Being such an old game, this can be a real pain to configure modern wheels with. I use a ThrustMaster T150, and to set it up you have to change the settings with the wheel completely, and dig into the config files to reconfigure how steering works, and find FFB plugins to make the force feedback feel decent or just exist. These problems don't exist with other, more modern games that use wheels.			",37,8,18,9,11,0,4

												Don't let the fact that this game is nearly 10 years old steer you away.  This game is fantastic and runs smooth across triple screens at 5358x1080 on my 580gtx at a consistent 60fps with a 50 car field.  It looks fantastic for any age and delivers way more realism in terms of experience than anything on consoles for less than 10 bucks.  Plus you can mod in 3,600 vehicles at 725 tracks overnight in one download with the auto-updater from our friends at Bockbierbude.   Amazing!Tips: Set process affinity for all cores to on, make sure you run in high performance mode power plan, set nvidia to high perfomance modes and use vsync and triple buffering to get rid of stuttering if you see it.

												I admit GSCE is my favourite sim, but I bought the standalone DVD verison of rFactor 1 many years ago and I decided to buy this old favourite now it is on Steam. Reasons: It's very good for a blast in the career mode, with earnings, fines, and purchasable upgrades, which GSCE does not have.Also, it is a very moddable platform, and as many of the tracks share some original files with GSCE, such as AIWs, I can use the available ISI Dev tools to edit track paths and test them in this game, and use them in both.I own rF2 & have tried the Assetto Corsa demo, & for me, they may be the sims of the future but they still have a way to go before they are the full package, so in the meantime, there is strong life left in the Gmotor engine, and with so many mods available, there is excellent value in GSCE and rFactor, or even both of them.Finally, there's great performance even if you have a lesser powered pc.

												Conclusion first:I recommend rFactor to people who don't mind dated graphics and who know computers pretty well and are fine with all the trouble finding mods all over the internet and installing the mods. Search for some rFactor video on Youtube. If you can't stand the graphics, or if you want a game that has great content out-of-the-box, stay away from rFactor.Although this sim has been out for many years, and it looks dated and starts to show its age in many aspects, and although I started sim racing from Assetto Corsa and Project Cars with much much better graphics, rFactor has taken up more and more of my sim racing time. It is a pretty solid mod platform and a solid sim racing game in general. I would recommend this game to anyone who's not too concerned about graphics and wants a racing sim with lots of contents. In fact on some tracks rFactor on my machine looks better and more impressive than its sequel rF2.Pros:1. Lots of mods providing almost anything you want with car racing. Lots of cars and tracks avaiable for download on various websites.2. The handling of cars is quite natural. Of course how good a car drives highly depends on the quality of the mod, but generally speaking if you follow other people's suggestions you can get pretty decent experience.3. The racing aspect of the game is solid. AI is pretty good providing nice battles, you get endurance features, and you can make your own championship or use what other people have made.Cons:1. Very dated look and graphics. It offers day/night transition but it looks pretty bad.2. Championship mode feels very basic and there's no added feature to give you extra sense of achievement (such as a splash screen at the end to show the podium etc.).3. Your experience with the game highly depends on the quality of mods. In fact I think it depends on the mods way too much. The base content is very very weak.4. It is a PITA to find good mods and install them. Sometimes it's very hard to find a working download link because the mod might be old, and it's very hard to keep track of all the versions of the mods. Unlike the convenient rF2 Steam workshop implementation, the rF1 mod sites are very messy. Some mods screws up shared files of the game and breaks other mods, and some mod developers make unnecessary installation executable rather than just a compressed file to deploy their mod.5. The road car side of this game is very, very limited. Even you go around the Internet and find all the good road car mods, it still feels very weak. Yes I know there is a Shift Street mod which is NFS Shift series rip-off but nearly all the cars have terrible handling and generally do not feel like the real thing.Mods that I enjoy:1. Enduracers' endurance mod. I particularly like the Flat6 series.2. HistoX GT and Touring mod. This mod requires you having GT Legends, and the installation guide is convoluted. But as soon as you get it working almost every car is a blast to drive.I think I'll probably give rFactor something like a 8/10.			",85,14,25,4,4,0,6

												After the HUGE  dissapointment of the  NASCAR games recently  i decided to  go  for  a  much   older but highly rated old favourite  reccomended by various race sim sites ,Okay the graphics are dated   but the handling is  great  and above all customizable as i am not the most  skilled driver in these things ,track selection is varied  and can be added too,as can be vehicles  and vehicle skins. so far i am enjoying  this purchase  and have no real complaints AI Seems to be at least  livable and raceable against  unlike the official   current  game.so yes i will  give this a huge thumbs up!

												rFactor is an amazing racing sim that holds up very well today since it was released in 2006. While the cars and tracks you start out with are decent, you can expand your choices by downloading some of the thousands of mods that add cars and tracks. Want to change Ayrton Senna's fate at Imola? Download the F1 1994 mod. Enjoy watching the IZOD IndyCar series and wish you were a driver? There are mods for that. Prefer slower-paced vehicles and touring cars? Plenty of mods for that too. rFactor is a game that is able to be tailored to your tastes by the mods that you download and that sets it apart from other racing games. Worth buying at full price.

												The stock content certainly shows it's age, 10 years by now. However where rFactor really shines is in the mods, there is an unmatched amounts of mods for rFactor, literally thousands of track and car mods are available. You can find mods for almost every year of Formula 1 and racing series you haven't even heard of. While the graphics in those mods won't be able to compete with Project Cars and the like, they can still look really nice and detailed and often substantially better then the stock content.The game might be old, but it's essentially a legend by now and it will take quite some more years before any other sim out there will get remotely close to matching what rFactor along with all it's mods can offer. This should be in the collection of any serious simracer.			",735,437,45,95,85,7,124

												An alright game for what it is, but not for its price. Game is almost 12 years old and the pricetag is too high for a game of that age. Force-feedback is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to set up properly if you play with a wheel. The upsides are the amount of mods on the game, I have about 500 car mods installed worth 50gb and a lot of tracks. Online community is still alive and most of what I've seen are drifting lobbies. Modern simulators, like Assetto Corsa, completely destroy this game in almost every aspect so you're better off buying a newer game if you recently bought a wheel(like I did) and looking for a cheap game to try it out.

												rFactor 1 is pretty unique. This is mod support writ large, a build-your-own-racing-sim kit.The stock content is, essentially, a placeholder for whatever mods you're going to drop into the game.It's rough around the edges and tricky to get force feedback working with the fidelity of more modern games, but here you can find some obscure and wonderful racing experiences.

												I first discoverd rfactor when I was at a car fair that had an F1 simulator. So when I went over to have a go I enjoyed the F1 car model and the sim that came with it. Since then I was clueless to know what the name of the software it was using until now when one day I was looking through Steam and when I randomly found it I said to myself ""Hang on! This is the same sim that the F1 simulator was using!!"" So I downloaded it, Installed it on to my computer and gave it a go out of the box and it became my main racing sim ever since.""My thoughts on Rfactor""It very customisable and has lots of features compare to other Racing Sims I.ve played and has the best driving physics I have seen in a long time. Its has a lot of support from it's fanbase and has plenty of Mods on Rfactor central with new ones still being released for it to this day and if you use Windows 10 like myself then fear not you can still play it. You can ever drive in and out of the pit lane manually, Very few racing sims let you do this but Rfactor is one of them that gives you the option to drive in and out of the pitlane by yourself or let it do it for you. The only thing I have against it is the AI but don't get me wrong Rfactor's AI is great and fun to race against but it really depends on the track your racing on and how you have it configured. You will have to do alot of configuring to the AI to  to get exciting races from them. There are times when they will overtake with ease which is mainly at sharp bends but on the straights they sit behind the other car until the end of the straight in which it does ruin the experiance a little bit. One time I was right behind a car which is an AI car and it was sitting behind the other car on the straight and he was just sitting there and not overtaking him while slighty braking behind him when I got the slipstream from both cars and passed both of them with ease. Overall I enjoyed Rfactor and I clocked 270 Hours of this sim at the time of writing this reveiw with tons of Mods ranging from GT, Prototype and even F1 mods. I reccomend getting the mods from Rfactor central because there is a lot of content to choose from there.Overall Rating: 9/10 ",24,1,13,1,12,0,1

												I've played far more than 10.3 hours since I've had rFactor far longer than I've had the Steam Key.  Let's start with pros and cons.  It's rFactor-the swiss army knife of sim racing.  Don't like what it does, download something totally different for it and change the game completely.  Admittedly, the ISI content that comes with rFactor is not good when compared to what modders have done with the game.  If you don't download any mods then I'd imagine you'd pretty damn disappointed with rFactor.  If you download some mods, then you're going to enjoy it much more.  Some mods I'd recommend-Enduracers-Historic Touring Cars-Cart Factor-V8 Supercars Unleashed-Formula E (having a blast with this at the moment)-DRM Revival (loud old cars with too much horsepower)As for tracks there are hundreds.  Some of my favorites include-Any of the Australian tracks (Barbagello, Mt. Panorama, etc)-Monza, Nordschleife, Hockenheim, etcrFactor has great mods and tracks.  It's a lot of fun to try them out.  Sure you'll get some bad ones but you can't go wrong with any of the mods I listed above.  I'm sure there's a few I've left out but I'm sure you'll discover them on your own.  There are still mods being made for this and there's still about 100x as many mods for rFactor 1 as there are for rFactor 2.  At this point, rFactor 1 is  the better buy over rFactor 2 in my eyes.

												rFactor is not a racing game; it's a thriving workshop and a way to experience virtually every single kind of motorsports in the world, first-hand.rFactor is just like a Cabbage Patch Kid; everybody has a different kind of rF setup, and things can be added and removed at any time.There are many different mods (virtually all of which are FREE!) that can expand rFactor to your very own personal liking and preference. Want to go racing on the bumpy concrete runways of Sebring? You can get that. But what's Sebring without sportscars? Try the EnduRacers and GTPC mods, and your wish will be granted. Also, many of these mods can be expanded even further (!) with all manner of extra skins, car packs and tracks.It's not the best looking game out there, but for something made in 2005, it looks great. Some modders have even given these limitations the middle finger; even on high-mid graphics settings, some of these add-on cars and tracks look absolutely amazing. Also, it's a rare example of a highly-regarded modern game that DOESN'T need a NASA supercomputer to run. My PC is an absolute potato, but it still runs absolutely fine, even with as many as 63 cars on the track at the same time. (Maybe it's powered by GlaDOS technology?)If you're looking for a great racing sim that can be easily added to, throw GTR2, Project CARS and Assetto Corsa out the window and get this. You won't regret it.			",3,0,4,0,4,0,0

The cars aren't on rails they can actually see your car and will adjust and drive around you.  Simply put this game is a classic, it's a masterpiece in the racing genre.  It is only beat by better graphics in present day racing sims.			",64,5,35,11,127,12,51

When I discovered this gem back in 2009 and all of the mods, tracks, etc. that you can use with it, there is no game or ""sim"" that brings the value like rFactor.  Sure rFactor 2 has been released now, but if you are feeling nostalgic or don't have the computer to run rFactor 2, then this original is well worth the investment.

This game also has some nice short track oval mods that you will enjoy. To bad my home track was never converted from NR2003 to RFactor so I could enjoy it with the late model mod.

If you would rather have the experience over visuals this game is for you, remember this game is old, If not Assetto, PC will be more your thing. This is one of the best modded racing games of all time, so loads of good quality content. However the price tag of £19 is a bit steep, i got this for less than £5 in the sale and it is definetely worth it if you can grab it in a good sale.Multiplayer almost dead, you will be able to get a race on a server somewhere though.

												I didnt have this game as a kid growing up. Instead I had the game, the myth, the legend, Nascar Racing Season 2003. I loved the game to death. But the disc broke a long time ago and over the years i grew out of racing and into shooters. Recently, ive been getting back into racing, but sadly since NR2003 does not work on Windows 10, I scowered Steam for a good racing game. Two games that always came up were rFactor and iRacing. Much prefering to race alone than with people, i picked this up...And im so glad I did!This is a perfect replacement for NR2003. The cars and oval tracks are amazing and satisfy me. The stock content is good enough for me, but I would love to play with the mods! If only i can find a working website or a zip archive that'll actually unpack...And lastly, the physics... oooh goodness the physics~. Lets just say... im having a lot of fun with it~Ill definitely pick up rFactor 2 when i get the money, I can imagine its just as good as this.If you want a racing game, get this. just do it.

												Lets start by saying that with the stock content rfactor is pretty much worthless, with quality mods however it still provides some of the best feeling driving available, for starters i'd recommend grabbing HistorX , DRM revival and enduracers , you can find pretty much anything you could possibly want to drive out there, but it may not be of the best quality, same goes for tracks.

												This game beats all the games like Gran Turismo, Project Cars, Forza Motosport 4,5 basically all of the sim racing games off the board easily. The game doesn't have so much to offer itself, but the mods are LIMITLESS. Like you can mod anything to the game! The realism of some tracks/maps is unreal due to GPS/Laser scanning. PROS:-Alot of content to download made by the community-Still an active community.-One of the most realistic sim racers of all time. -Wheel Setup is perfect! (also supports the lower-end wheels)-Leagues-Project D 2.3.1 for the players who likes to watch forward from the sidewindows.CONS:-Graphics are outdated but it was released in 2007.-Even though the wheel setup is perfect, I experienced some issues with my wheel. (The car didn't want to steer to the right sometimes even though I had default settings.) The game also thought my wheel was only 180 degrees MAX. But thats sorted now.			",44,0,11,0,4,0,4

												Back in the day this game was probably the best sim racing game out there. However now it is really showing its age to the point where it is simply not worth spending the cash on considering as there are so many better games in this genre out there currently. Installing mods for this game is a hassle compared to rfactor 2 which is another negative. I bought this game as part of a bundle for £1.99 and its not worth it. Steam wants £18.99 they must be having a laugh.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rfactor is a great game, when it came out it was a massive gamechanger, sadly a moment that i missed however picking it up i realise that maybe i was a little too late. The engine is solid, the stability is solid, there is content, there is a insane number of mods and they work, they work well. Alas things things start to turn sour but its not the fault of the game, its that as time has gone by new players have entered the ring, the successor has blown the doors off this game, others have brought the engine and made better games with it.In the end this game is truely awesome however its old and it shows in the looks and technical sides and it shows massively in FFB. It not worth its price, a 10 year old game for a niche market isnt be this price, SCE is slightly more expensive and is a lot more fleshed out. The so called ""next gen"" sims like AC and RF2 have features this could only dream of.Id consider this on a sale but in its beaten brutally by the competition currently.			",287,101,36,76,28,0,27

												Game isn't that good and most sites that have mods for the game demand money from you. And then limit free offerings to 3 files then demand you wait for 48 hours to download another 3 files or you can pay. So no this game is not worth a penny plenty of good racers on steam that are cheaper and offer free mods and have more to it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The point of Steam release would be to UPDATE the freaking game. It so stock that you can't even play it with wheel or controller, you have to download schitload of mods to make it work properly. No patches, no support at all.Good job ISI developer team, you just robbed us. You just care about the idiot rFactor 2 what nobody plays due to the idiot payment method.BTW the game is good, but the attitude of the developers are the worst, dayz devs even more enthusiastic LOL			",344,68,45,24,45,9,25

												Just another one of thos racing games that if you approach a bend too fast the only thing that will happen is that you will go straight ahead instead of turning. No amount of steering or braking will alter your path, once it decides you were going too fast, it will continue to go in a straight line until you hit something or if there was enough room your speed slowly decreases to almost stopped. If you like uncontrollable car games, fantastic, buy it!			",336,181,40,87,47,3,99

This is really only fun if you already know the game. They say mods are availible, however I cant seem to find any or the ones i do find i have no clue what they do. This isnt really a game, so much so that its a project. Wish i would have know that before buying it. TLDR: No fun, too much work to make it a game.			",8,0,2,4,1,0,0

												I do not recommend that anyone pay good money for this sim.  Not only is it outdated, you will spend about 50% of your time dealing with controller issues.  I (try to) play this sim w/ my Logitech G27 setup, and there are constant bugs.  You might eventually get it right (if you're lucky), however it will eventually fail again.  Extremely frustrating.  I should also add that my system has no problem with Assetto Corsa, or The Crew, as other examples.			",20,0,21,1,5,0,1
