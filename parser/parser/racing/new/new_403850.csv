												If you gonna make a mobile port game, don't forget that WE CAN'T BUY ANYTHING IN GAME!Seriously, I bought a new ship for 40 Red Crystals, and that was too expensive already, considering that We drop like 2~3 crystals per stage, and I already started with 30. But after one single stage my ship got damaged, and I had to wait 20 MINUTES for life regen!!! Or pay 1 crystal (which I didn't have) for quick regen. Great game: play 2 minutes, wait 20 for another round!And you also can't select/confirm options with the controller. I'm using Xbox 360 controller and I got to use mouse to click on boxes that appear in game. The controller only serves to maneuver the ship left and right while you're ""racing"".Dont buy it, untill they port it correctly. ",623,151,20,44,26,2,63

												I have won this game in a lucky drawing. Firstly first picture is wrong, there is not such thing as ""Striking a shattering blow against devilish Robot"", that is Episode 2, which looks it was planned to be added, but since the game is no longer at Early Access and is showing at many bundles now I don't have much hope for it. The game is almost 50/50 for me, if devs will introduce next Episode(s) I would be more then happy to change my mark to possitive.This is an arcade game.Advantages:-good optimisation-runs under Linux-trading cards-nice graphics (and nice girls)-crew and upgrades (although only 2 ships to choose from)-enjoyable but difficult at some times-optional grinding levelsDisadvantages:-short (my time is time it took me to end the game - see also beginning of this review)-leftovers from flash/android platform like time waiting, premium crystals (although devs ware able to remove all microtransactions and crystals are nicely introduced into the game)-there could be far more content (like different guns, more ships, maybe artgallery) ",115,18,14,27,10,0,23

There's a few aspects of the game that are enjoyable, but are just outnumbered by the number of things wrong with the game, things that I highly doubt an extended period of Early Access will fix:Positives:-Good sound effects & music-Unique, interesting art style-The game's overall light, casual toneNegatives:-Intrusive, downright lazy attempts at storytelling-Unpolished, half-hearted attempts at introducing RPG elements-Repetitive gameplay-No replay valueOverall Grade:3/10			",147,24,2,4,11,1,5

												I give a non-recommendation for two things, firstly, completely broken games, and secondly, games that I find mediocre and/or flawed, Sky To Fly: Faster Than Wind falls into the later. It’s a running game set in a steampunk universe, and while it’s in Early Access I feel the game has shown its original roots and developer intentions. Review -

 I’ll address the elephant in the room; yes it’s a mobile port. This is shown through the use of a premium currency and though it is obtainable in game it is extremely slow. Also the premium currency ships and crew members are superior to the ‘f2p’ options in every single way. It bares its ugly teeth when you have to wait 20 MINUTES! for a ship to recover its HP after a mission, but don’t worry, with some premium currency we’ll have ‘er up and runnin’ in no time! Usual runner stuff applies, go through a level, pick up coins, dodge terrain and enemies, and use premium currency to give yourself a boost for that level. Unlike most running games though the controls are slow and stiff, and there is no feeling of speed. Your control options are either left or right and the use of an ‘active’ ability, this is less than your usual smart phone runner. Also the sense of difficulty is non-existent due to the slow gameplay and if you run into any difficulty it’s due to the limitation of the controls and generally poorly designed enemies, but if you do struggle you can spend that good ol’ premium currency and revive yourself!Sky To Fly: Faster Than Wind is an example of a game that is extremely flawed for the PC space. While it may boasts great graphics and story mode for a smart phone game, this is the PC and the standards are different. The laziness shown through the keeping of premium currency and all the ‘features’ it entails is just something you can’t ignore, and turns something that could be a somewhat enjoyable experience sour. Edit: The game is now fully released and none of the issues have been addressed. The points in the review still hold true.			",374,70,4,34,40,2,41

								Well, first of all, lets start by saying that it is a mobile port. I don't know where the good views came from. The game feels a bit slow, and yes, I haven't played the game that much.Review

My first thoughts were, this is a mobile port, the big buttons and the settings that you would have on a phone game or flash game. I didn't like it. When you would boot it up, you could select full screen but when you would boot it up the next time, it would go back to windowed mode. That tells me that this is a mobile port.You would mostly crash into that object if you are near it, not touching it. You would also collect cogs. MOBILE PORT You have this ingame currency. The action is really tense. NOT. This game just feels like you should play this game on your way to school/work. You also have these anoying timers, to repair you ""warship""And there is this annoying 5 second repeated music in the menu screen.And yes, I rate it 0/10 DON'T BUY IT! IT IS A MOBILE PORT!EDIT: THIS IS A ♥♥♥♥ING MOBILE PORT! WHY DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? EVEN IF IT IS NOT, IT FEELS LIKE A ♥♥♥♥ING MOBILE PORT!			",60,8,5,1,10,0,2

I am not normally a fan of mobile ports to the PC but Sky to Fly really surprised me. It's kind of like a runner except it's mission based as opposed to endless and it has a story, though it's pretty threadbare and also poorly translated.The game play is done with only two keys (with a third later on) and largely involves dodging things as you get from place to place to complete story and side missions. You collect two different forms of currency along the way, which can be used to acquire better crew members with different traits, as well as upgrade your ship. It's not complex or difficult in the slightest but it has a very relaxes, zen feel. The art style is superb and conveys the unique world of floating islands very nicely and it's accompanied with very nice, chill music. This isn't a game you play for challenge or a massive sense of accomplishment, it's just relaxing fun.This is a game that clearly has free-to-play roots from mobile as some mechanics like timers are still in this (though made so fast, they're utterly pointless) but there are no in-game purchases whatsoever and you're given plenty of currency and can finish the entire 3-4 hour adventure in one sitting if you want. Many formerly free-to-play mobile games that port to PC either leave the microtransactions in or jack up the price to an absurd level to avoid them. Sky to Fly only costs $4 and has no microtransactions. For me, the experience was an absolute steal at that price.If you want something challenging or ""hardcore"", you're not going to find that with Sky to Fly but as someone who does love hardcore games, this was a nice little diversion when I just wanted to check out and chill for a while. You can't go wrong for the price in my opinion.			",748,151,15,54,55,3,73

												A competent runner, but a poorly made port. Could not progress part the ship buying stage due to not having the crystals or money, and had to wait several hours to even make that money if i wanted to keep going with that run.Upsides to it is that it's got reall nice art and music, and the missions are perfectly bitesize for a mobile game.

Early Access Review
								I deleted my original review, after a long read through it I felt immature myself.  Yet I found a lot of it very true, and after investigating a lot of it I decided I should re do it.  My original thoughts remain; the game itself is appaulingly bad for a game you have to pay for.  But here I want to focus more on something else than the actual game; what it originally was.But first review about what it currently is, and isn'tWhat it is:A ""Runner"" game that's currently free on the Google Play Marketplace.  Here's the link so you don't waste money on this version and can try it out on an emulator such as bluestacks.  Personally I dislike the publisher so I'd do it.Game: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.absolutist.skytoflyfree&hl=enBluestacks Android Emulator: http://www.bluestacks.com/What it isn't / What it lacks- It isn't a good looking game- It doesn't have a good options menu- There's a lack of decent storytelling (All text, all in weird prompts)- There's a constant tutorial going on rather than the ""experimentation"" way of teaching the player.- It isn't a ""Sports"", ""Simulation"", or really a ""Early Access"" game.  I feel like they're using Early Access as a shield, though if you read their description they're supposed to be done in less then a month from now, though their models are in poor detail and lacking polish as a game.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------To the Publisher----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dearest Absolutist Ltd.Why was your responce to my admitedly childish original review in itself more childish, and less professional as a company.  Why have you TWICE now used innapropriote tags to advertise your game?  Why are you promoting a sequel to a game in a pre finished state?  That's worse than Ubisoft releasing multiple ♥♥♥♥ Assassins Creed games within the same year.  Why do you try to hide the fact that your games are Mobile Ports?  And why do you have NO mention of steam on your website?---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------To the Developer---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dear AIVIK LLCWhere did the Sky To Fly MMORPG game idea go?  I still see your forums active, I played the preview, though I don't know Russian myself so I cannot understand all of it.  And I overall liked the idea.  So why did you seemingly lose track of that, your websites seem out of date after all this time though, why did you take your assets for the MMORPG game, and put them into a ""runner"" game, with a closer perspective making them look horrible?  I am in no way mad with you as I am the Publisher, I just want answers.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------To the Reader---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you want to know more about what I am talking about, please follow these links.http://absolutist.com -- The publishers website, where there's no mention of anything on steam.  And they advertise free games.http://aivik.ru/index.html -- The developers site, where there's art for Sky To Fly there.  (Most noteworthy being a robot seen in the Sky To Fly: Soulless Leviathan trailer)  All in russian so try using Google Chrome to translateAnd most interesting of all:http://sky2fly.ru/ -- Sky To Fly's website.  With a forum, documentation and the actial MMORPG (All in russian again) with more concept art and a free demo with a promising show to put on, if it were in English I'd actually give it a try.  I did try it even in russian though.  So investigate a little.  You'll see the Android version seems to have some of the content in both Faster than Wind and Soulless Leviathan possilby meaning that they've been chopping the Android version up into 3 games of the same type, and with the smallest being 4 dollars I only imagine them upping the price.  But if all three are 4 dollars you're spending a maximum of 12 dollars on a game with assets as far back as 2010, thats free to play on Android.  Just think about these anti consumer practices at play here.  I do plan on doing more investigating, and hopefully make a video on everthing.  Thanks.Also here's a little proof that there is asset re use going on here:https://i.gyazo.com/11cf7618546dcfe2cd8f29539c939bae.jpgTechnically it's still theirs to use but it is interesting to say the least.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I decided to keep my original review archived here.  Everything after this point is disconnected from the rest-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Played 10 minutes after receiving a key for review and blindly going in.  And I can say without a doubt probably the worse 10 minutes I've spent in my life, doing nothing would be better than playing this game.Well perhaps not but lets go into detail.Story: Might as well be none, in a forced cinematic you literally bump into a airship and theres just a captain and no crew apparently whos like 'oh you're going to this place let me lead you!' and then is like 'my engines broken' and I immedietly stopped giving a ♥♥♥♥.Graphics: *Satire/sarcasm coming up*WOW THEY BLEW ME AWAY SO REALISTIC I WAS SUPRISED MY INTEL INTEGRATED GRAPHICS COULD HANDLE THEM!!!!!!!!!!!  YOU LOOK AT THE TEXTURES AND MODELS AND YOU JUST GAZE IN AWE OF THIS WORLD YOU'VE JUST ENTERED THROUGH YOUR MONITOR, I WISH I HAD A OCCULUS RIFT JUST TO BE IN FIRST PERSON STEERING MY SHIP ACROSS THE BOUNDLESS SKY!!!!!!!!!!!!! BUY GAYME NAO!!!!  *Sarcasm done with*In truth, the game only supports 4:3 resolutions.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=623732094Gameplay:  Supports WASD and Arrow keys and is just a floaty ship, nothing else.PS; Graphics requirements make no sense ""Graphics: 512 Mb""  and in more ways than one, not only not referencing a graphics card series or anything of the sorts but using Mb not MB so megabit, not megabyte, and megabit refers to transfer speeds so is it 512 mb/s? for graphics?  That's really odd.Also its in genres it shouldn't be in, like Sports, and Simulation, even racing which it might fit in as a minigame but I think either the publisher or developer is abusing steam to put their game in more favorable searches, and perhaps more.  I do think a lot of the positive reviews are odd...----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Also here's the comments from the developer and my responce:https://i.gyazo.com/66fc74ca8a0e43ad28ec411eee5e3e17.png(Taken on March 17th 2016, they made no attempt to counter my rebuttel)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Also my video review for anyone interestedhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfa2y1to7VY ",128,19,2,6,6,0,8

												Tippy tap thats the sound of an iPad screen, well what should be an iPad screen.Sky to Fly faster than I can say the title of this game is a game that would be right at home on a mobile device (i'm pretty sure its on google play!). Though this version has increased graphical quality over its mobile counterpart. The two main controls are left and right and well thats about it what do you expect.You're a pilot for a ship and your goal is to reach the end of the level and by golly there are things in the way! Floating islands, weird animals and the most difficult to get past enemy ships. When completing a level you get a star rating out of 3. This means that anyone who is kind of a completionist like myself will be replaying levels for that 3 star rating. Since your ships goes at about the same pace without powerups or other bonuses found on the map its a little weird having ""time"" as one of the ratings in the ending screen.You can change your ships crew giving you different bonuses which gives a small amount of customisation.If you're a mobile enthusiast, temple run addict or anywhere in between you'll probably like this game. 7/10Sky FTW is pretty neat, steampunk world with some silly characters and for $3.99 you can't really go wrong.

								I didn't know what to expect when I first started this game, but after playing it for almost 2 hours, I can say I'm enjoying it so far.  The game has a beautiful art style to it, excellent soundtrack, and very easy to use controls.  It has that mobile port sort of feel in some places, but overall I recommend playing this game... especially if you enjoy casual gameplay.Sure, the game is not all that difficult to play, nor is it all that expansive, but for an Early Access Game it runs perfectly fine and I think the developer has nailed the price point for a game like this.  I guess if I had some things I would change, it would be the graphic options.  Clearly the game looks great, but without having a full 1080p HD setting, it was sort of a let down.  If you are interested in seeing my thoughts as I played this game for the first time, here is my short First Look Video...

+ Unique Environments high in the sky with floating islands and buildings+ Asthetically appealing+ A variety of abilities, crew members, power-ups, airships and so on.+ A good story where you begin as uh...a mailman, and end up finding yourself fleeing from pirates, and having wild adventures+ Easy to learn, and pretty casual for people looking for a fairly easy gameThis Game is in EARLY ACCESS, do not take these negatives too seriously- If you ""restart"" a level, you lose all the power-ups you purchased along with the gold, and your ship starts at the same health you had before you restarted. (huge penalty)- I felt like the game was a bit too slow, I feel like it would be a bit more fun if everything was sped up a bit- Although pretty good, you do get the sense that this is a mobile port, with very basic controls, multiple currencies, and very large UI buttons~ I didn't get too far, but I felt like this game could improve if you had the ability to shoot or somehow ram the enemies, I feel as if it's a bit too focused on evading.

								I'ts not a bad game, but this is obviously a port from a mobile game that hasn't been  adapted. It's crerative but the gameplay is too slow			",1737,715,55,208,273,18,291

								The game looks amazing, for me personally it feels more like an adventure and i don't mind that at all.Following the storyline you will be facing challenge after challenge and the pace will only go fast. For the few hours that i have played the game, i want to finish it more and more. ",26,3,0,6,12,0,11

								I was given a key to review this game, and while I appreciate it being free; I would have bought this none the less! Beautiful graphics. Simple, but immersive gameplay. Very creative characters! Oh, and one more thing.... SKY PIRATES! :D Not graphically demanding, either. A must buy!			",86,10,2,14,9,1,1

								Sky To Fly Faster Than Wind is a decent Indie game for $3.99. The game takes place in a fantasy world and has a lot to offer than what it costs.

Pros :1) Beautiful graphics & epic levels.2) In early access and still has a lot to offer.3) Simple control and interface.4) Clear and small introduction to everything new on your journey. (I liked the idea very much)5) Smooth 60fps gameplay & responsive controls.6) Nothing complicated.7) Thoughtful and humourour dialogues.Cons :1) Not the best of stories as you would expect.2) Adding the slowing down button would have been a better experience but that would hurt the flow of the game of course.3) Adding a few more variations and a few more things to do will take the game to a whole new level. Like implementing    better one on one fights with pirates, a boss maybe or something else.			",18,2,1,2,3,0,0

Dodge Sky Pirates and floating objects whilst collecting loot and power-ups in this charming steam punk runner. Sky to Fly: Faster Than Wind is a stunningly beautiful steampunk-themed runner about saving a sky-city from cruel pirates. Play on 20+ different levels, upgrade your ship and discover the mysteries of the malicious marauders. This game lifts the veil on the wonderful world of Sky to Fly, where everything is out of the common run. It swings you to an alternative reality in which people had to abandon the solid earth buried under debris, for the islands floating high above. In the next three months we will give you an opportunity to engage in epic sky battles on a variety of airships, and in a year you may create your own civilization and challenge other members of the world of Sky to Fly. Meanwhile, enjoy 20 different levels in the Story mode and limitless missions from friends you are going to meet during the game, upgrade your ship and discover the mysteries of the malicious marauders. - Recommended!

								How nice this game are!At first glance,it can looks like a mobile game,because of their ui,but when you start to play you see that's not a ugly trash mobile port,is a beautiful pc game! Gameplay Gameplay of this game is simple,since you need to control the plane with the W,A,S,D or arrow keys.The game has 2 modes of playing it:Missions - Here you complete the main missions of the game,with the instructions given,you need to go from A to B,not hard as well,but you need to take care with the enemies it can reduces your shield,and you don't win the 3 stars no damage on the end of level,some missions have a desired time to complete.And the another mode you play the missions that you unlocked before to win more money to buy pilots. Music The sounds of the game are great,it has a calm and refreshing soundtrack,and the sound effects are ok to the game. Positive Points + Game is cheap+ Has much content to play+ soundtrack is calm and relaxing Negative Points - Achievements are listed,but not working.OverallThe game is cheap and if you are finding a simple game,that suits you.Good fly!

												I'm not a hardcore gamer. I have other priorities in life and games are a way for me to escape priorities. I love games that doesn't require too much brain power as I use too much juice for other stuff. :P A simple design, a beautiful concept, nice soundtracks and above all, something memorable. This game has it all. It's very relaxing to cruise around and enjoy the scenery. I must say though, this game still has a lot to strive for, but in the future it will be a really, really brilliant game. (Early access review) {Marked as recommended}After game release and halfway through the game, this game starts to become a big headache. Drops are few and rare in between. It was damn bloody hard to buy that stupid ship. The one thing that baffles me the most is that 20 minute wait for tasks. Why? I have no idea. So all in all, despite a promising start this game is not worth the buy.			",38,4,0,0,1,0,2
