												Thgis gmae is like hard n64 platforming mixed with team fortress jump and surf maps but it lasts forever and also it's really cool.			",59,6,1,15,2,0,1

								Very steep learning curve and encouraging to beat the highscores, also pretty funny to try out different seeds in the random levels section i can recommend ""Schacht"" for example ;) or/ 16783962			",222,31,0,14,21,2,21

												A solid and really fun running game in the same vein as T.E.C 3001 and some others. Schacht has you make your way through procedurally generated sci-fi levels where the goal is to get to the end whilst avoiding obstacles. The manoeuvres available are similar to other running games such as jumping, air dashing, wall-running, swinging from grapple points, and using jump pads. At times there are force fields that require the player to use their EMP ability, which disables some force fields and enables others.The controls are very slick and everything works really smoothly, though there is a bit of a learning curve at the start. I've particularly found jumping between multiple wall-running platforms to be a bit fiddly if you're not used to it, but with time you get a hang of it.There are daily, weekly, and monthly challenges provided with highscore charts for a bit of a competitive element for those who really dig it, as well as an option to simply pick a randomly generated level.There is a very easy-to-use level editor available in the game too, which provides a large variety of platforming pieces. It takes literally a few minutes to construct a level, which you can then submit to the workshop and have other people play it. Having this kind of community support feature can greatly prolong the lifetime of the game. One minor problem though, I've found trying to access Workshop from in-game causes it to freeze and become unresponsive. Not sure if it's a problem with my computer or with the game in general. So the only way I found to get community-made levels was by exiting the game first.Generally a really fun game and highly recommended for anyone who likes running games full of challenges.

								Truely addictive game! The whole movement feels so smooth and satisfying that you might find yourself playing the same level over and over again because you know you can do better. As a huge Mirror's Edge fan, I am very satisfied!The daily/weekly/monthly challenges are also great because seeing your name at the top of the highscore list is just so awesome!Visually the game is also super pleasing, performance is excellent! Also the character individualization is so funny! You can put the most random but hilarious things on for example your head, like a toilet plunger.With just costing 7,99â‚¬ you can't really do anything wrong buying the game! Give it a try!
