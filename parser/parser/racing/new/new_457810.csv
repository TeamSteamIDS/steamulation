												I bought this game noticing it was on sale recently on Steam, as I'm a fan of good endless runner arcade style games (the last one I got was Race the Sun - which is MILES better).The story is awful, and the English translations (I sincerely hope English is not your first language as a dev) are deplorable. There is nothing more to say here.The graphics look alright, but that's not what I look for in an arcade style game like this - I want something quick and fun for when I have 5-10 minutes to kill waiting for someone, or want a game to pass the Steam Controller around with while talking with friends.The music and sound effects are a pretty bad fit too. The cannon doesn't feel like it has weight when fired - it sounds like a pop gun. The music sounds like someone just pirated some random instrumentals and threw em' together. I'll never forget infiltrating the prison of 'Windopolis' - a situation one would expect to be fairly tense - to.... Luau music???? I thought I was sitting on a beach in Hawaii.The gameplay is slow, and more importantly, BORING. Your airship will control like it is flying through molasses rather than air. Every level in the story mode is extremely repetitive.The Endless Mode, which really should be the bread and butter of this game, manages to be even worse than the story mode. I don't know if the difficulty never increases, or if it just takes a really long time, but 15 minutes of just dodging the same floating walls/debris over and over again collecting gears and speed up power ups that barely make a difference is... well, it's not interesting to say the least.To put it simply - the only way I could end Endless Mode was to ram myself into obstacles repeatedly and die after I was bored to tears. If this game really has this positive of a reception, people must have really low standards - be wary of the positive reviews here.			",132,21,2,11,20,1,11

												This was a lot of fun. Really short, but the gameplay was ace.I would love to see more levels, and ability to pick diffrent ships with diffrent strengths and weaknesses.			",148,39,3,61,9,1,25

												I don't mean to discourage potential buyers, but this game's cartoony physics totally turned me off. I know this is a runner and not a simulator, but it feels like some sort of magical anti-gravity ship more than a steam machine. Graphics are pretty and really well crafted, but the game's mood didn't cut it for me.Gameplay is way to easy.Music and sound effects suck, big time. Cannon pops like a pop gun.Refunded.

												It's pretty. It's cheap (especially so if on sale). It's painful to read.Doublooms, piastres...! Something useful anywayWe have to tell the Masked Man that Dana is alive! Why don't we drop in to him and then deliver the box. I wonder what's inside...""There are better racing games to play.While it shouldn't factor into this game much, its a fraction of a larger game that's been chopped up into smaller episodes that are just a repackaging of the same engine.

												Bought this game for a quick play the other day, enjoyed it very much. very entertaining, good sound, and good music. I thought for the 20 min I gave it. I enjoyed it a lot and plan on playing it more. There is a lot going on at once in some maps but if you are into those multi-tasking racers this is very good for 3-4 bucks! 8/10 so far!

												this game is a second part for ""sky to fly: faster than wind"". I've played the first part and i can say game's definitely got better - both technical part of it and story part: now you have guns from the very beginning, or, instead of guns the other ship can jump; i have a feeling game's got more dynamic, ship's flying faster, there are more different enemies and obstacles - swirls and lightninigs; more difficult tasks - definitely recommend!
