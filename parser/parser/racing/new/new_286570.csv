												So far I have been left with a bitter taste in my mouth and cannot recommend this game... yet.Pros:The graphics and optimisation. I have a FX-8320 and a GTX 970. I'm getting 60+ FPS with the whole grid on ultra.The handling model. I have a G27 and I am happy with the FFB and the physics have vastly improved, especially compared to F1 2014.Cons:No safety car. I don't know Codemasters reasoning for this but I personally feel it takes away from the game.This game crashes more than Maldonado. Ran a benchmark, crashed. Tried online, crashed. Started pro season mode, crashed. You get the idea.Littered with bugs. For now there is only one that I find truly game breaking. When I play Pro season mode, (for those who dont know, it is supposed to turn off all HUD and assists and locks you into cockpit cam) I still have all the assists on and since the menu is greyed out I can't manually turn them off.I would advise anybody interested in this game, to be patient and wait for future fixes and then consider a purchase.May update this in the future. 10/07/15------------------------------------------------------------24 hours of game time later I feel it is time to update my review.First off, since my first review they released a 2nd patch on the day of release, which is pathetic that it was even needed in the first place as it wasnt even a large one. Thankfully though it seems to have fixed the game crashing so Pastor can now sit safe and keep his reputation.The more I have driven in this game the more and more I'm enjoying racing the AI and the handling model. The Championship season, Quick race and Time trial modes are the ONLY parts of the game I would consider ready to be released. Pro season and Multiplayer however were and STILL ARE NOT READY.For the first time in the series you can actually race the AI wheel-to-wheel, and unlike Project Cars there aggresion is about right. The AI are very spacially aware so if you were to dive up there inside they won't turn in on you. They are also very racey themselves as they wont back out 100 metres before a braking zone as before, and will try to outbrake you if you leave the door open. For reference I have the AI on the hardest setting.However I would consider Championship season mode ready,although it does have a few features missing. You can no longer underfuel the car in this game and since you can no longer run rich fuel mix for longer than half a lap before your engine overheats, I end up with around 5 laps of fuel left at the end of a 100% race. You can no longer fully customize your strategy before the race, you can only choose between preselected strategies given to you by your teams strategist and with 100% races, generally speaking you're given 2 options but if you qualify within the top 10 it's normally 1. My final complaint with Championship season mode is the inability to customize the weekend length. There are 3 choices and cant be tweaked. Short weekend- 15 mins practice, one-shot qualifying, 25% race. Normal weekend- 30 mins practice, one qualifying round, 50% race. Long weekend- 1 hour practice, full 3 rounds of qualifying, 100% race.Quick race works as it should with you being able to actually tweak it to your liking and there's not much else to say. Time Trial has been improved upon now as at most circuits/corners the game is strict with you leaving track limits, but my new favourite feature is you can copy setups from people at the top of the leaderboards. I highly recommend doing this unless you want to be left alone and know what you're doing. My only problem with Time Trial is that at some corners you can still exceed track limits and not have your lap invalidated. Is it really that hard code""masters"" to just invalidate laptimes if you exceed track limits with all 4 wheels regardless of time lost/gained?I feel the need to mention at this point that the F1 2014 season is also included in this game as I'm rather neutral to its integration. Albeit a nice bonus, I bought this game for the 2015 season and would rather have had them focus more time on the current season than the previous one.The problem with Pro season mode mentioned in my first review is still there and upon further review  I think there was no real need for Codemasters to even add this mode as you can change your HUD, assist and camera angle in Championship season mode to the exact same settings.Now the real big-hitter that is Multiplayer. Blandly put, the multiplayer is a mess, there's no two ways about it. From unpredictable ghosting, to desynchonised lobbies, to driving through pit crews, to just straight up random teleporting, multiplayer is completely and utterly broken. With a supposed brand-new netcode, which showcases Codemasters ""master"" coding, multiplayer has been crippled before even mentioning there new matchmaking system known as ""hoppers"". The main problem with the new system is the player base gets spread out so much between the different game types that it takes so much longer to find the game even in the first week since release.After having played the game for a longer time period now, I would only recommend this game to people if you are only/mainly interested in the singleplayer experience. If Multiplayer was the main attraction stay clear as if it was a sprintmode lap 1 trainwreck of a pileup.Further updates pending upon release of further patches or DLC. 14/07/15			",61,1,6,6,3,0,0

												Dear Codemasters,What the hell? I have been a loyal fan of your racing games since 2007, but what is it with the F1 series? All the opporunity and all the promise and in every release problem after problem after problem. The most stable of the series was probably 2012 (though no FP1 and FP2 and the wet-to-dry transition problems still hurt). F1 2015 - released 2 months earlier than has been typical, and it's not ready for distribution. Let's make a simple and, I think, fair comparison: - DiRT Rally - came with some bugs, but that was the point right? I mean, it was touted as an Early Release title for which the community feedback has been integral to QAing the game as such that you have been able to appropriately focus your development efforts, and it's worked - immaculately. And... For those of us who got in early, we paid what, 60% of the cost of a full release?- F1 2015 - where to begin. Evidently from a development perspective, QA cycles have been all but completely omitted it seems. Some of the graphical elements are certainly more polished, and the handling model is refined, but otherwise, this bad-boy is completely smattered with issues. I am running an i7 5820 w/ 64 GB DDR4 and 2 GTX 970s in SLI and I am getting significant amounts of ""blur"" at assorted points throughout gameplay - not only while driving - it really doesn't look great. I tried ""Reset To Track"" and my car jumped around in reverse, smoked a wall and came to rest backwards on the track - that was an effect I was able to reproduce. The AI continuously drive up from behind me and smoke me like I'm not even there, sending me off track, damaging my car, and even penalising me. In just two hours of gameplay I had a crash when running benchmark mode, a random crash in the middle of a lap, 2 instances where when I started the game it was unresponsive to keyboard inputs for minutes, timing screens which flicker, setup screens which overlay one another making it virtually impossible to read the two conflicting layers of text, and a desaturated (almost to the point of being entirely greyscale) camera view once I used a flashback. All the points about ""I can't make my own character"", I personally couldn't care (well, aside from missing the helmet which I have used since F1 2010!), but the base playability MUST be there for full release, and in this case it isn't. Oh, and what's up with giving us PC'ers the option to try to use the voice commands if the functionality was never intended for the platform - it almost seems ""mean"" - queue up that fat Nelson kid from The Simpsons. It's unfortunate that ""the pinacle of motorsport"" is not represented appropriately, but I guess with the ""state of F1"" being what it is, what else can be expected? DiRT, DiRT 2, DiRT Rally, GRID - all amazing unforgettable titles, but F1 - the series has not been executed to the extent it should have been once yet. That's $360 I have been stupid enough to spend on not a single product which actually worked through and through. At this point I am officially turned off as I expect 50% - 60% of the community is, or will be over the coming days, based on the forums so far. It's a sad day...**UPDATED**More issues:Multiplayer - constant screen flickering - not changes to the settings from when I play in Championship or Pro Season modes. Engineer - I cannot hear a word my engineer says even with the car and environment turned down to 50 and the Speech to 100. Quit Game - Every time I go to quit game, Steam looks as though it's DLing a patch or something, prior to me getting an Error 41. Multiplayer - obviously not a glitch / bug, but Codies, did you really make the decision to include a Custom Multiplayer season where AI racers were not included? Like, I want to do the full season (co-op or adversarial) with a friend, but I can only race him... Yeah, there's no AI - how fun is that? And otherwise I have to find another 18 people to fill the grid and be online for Practice, Qually, and Race distances...			",15,5,11,5,16,0,8

												I've been playing this series for 3 years and this game probably has the best physics basis of the series but the rest is fiasco. No safety car&virtual safety car, no realistic track limit violation rules, no drive through penalty, completely terrible online system (game constantly causes mass disconnection at certain points) and optimization (especially in online) is terrible. I don't even want to mention no career option.I heard that Codemasters will take some pre-alpha or beta testers from the real players. If Codemasters keep listening 12-year-old arcade-lover English children who are moaning about ""auto-spin"" kerbs because they spin on a freaking kerb while using full throttle, this series will lose its only good feature: physics.You need to make driving hard (even more understeer because cars are still bloody fast - almost 3 seconds faster than real life, stiffer suspensions, less grip off the racing line, less grip on the racing line in wet surface - because of the rubber - etc.), make online more stable, provide more freedom (driver customization, maybe increasing driver ability options in career mode, also in season development), introduce realistic track limit rules and more strict penalties.Edit: Well, after the patch that includes ""strict corner cutting rules"", I have to revise my review. This game still lacks in almost all the fields I explained above. But they listen to us - they added strict corner cutting rules. And now, beta testers give great feedbacks about the game. In F1 2016, there will be safety car and proper career mode. Also, kerbs will be more punishing, throttle application will be harder, ideal racing line and braking points will make more difference, car setups will be even more effective in F1 2016 (F1 2015 responds changes in car setups pretty well in my opinion, they are on the correct path at least). I hope it will be more satisfying in all aspects.P.S.: By the way, those in previous paragraph are not my predictions. They are actual feedbacks and observations of one of the beta testers.

												CM F1 games have been disappointing since 2012, the only reason i bought this is because of how much i enjoy watching this sport and I wasn't hoping for much when I bought it but F1 2015 has stooped to a new low.The good:*Enhanced AI, they're actually racing each other (however they make no mistakes) and they will try aggressive moves.*Different cars and different engine manufacturers handle quite differentilyThe bad:*Game crashes randomly (and this is after the crash fixing patch)*Horribly optimized graphics, I can run GTA V on ultra yet i can't run this on high with a stable fps, suddenly i find the game dropping from 60 to 20 out of nowhere.*Game freezes for milliseconds after you look back and unfreezes at 2x speed when you return to normal view*Unrealistic rules, you can start on fresh set of tyres instead of quali tyres*Co-op mode removed*Safety car removedand the steaming horse ♥♥♥♥:*""Career"" mode*Unable to customize the sessions in career mode, why can't i have a 25% race with full qualifying?? you had that feature already why did you remove it?I'm really hoping the reviews will be so negative that CM will lose the rights to F1, we could use some decent devs to create a playable F1 game or at least get CM to fix this broken port because so far they have disregarded all of their customers.

												In 4hrs of play time so far, this game has crash more often that my 8hrs in Batman AK. Needs to patch the several issues raised in the forums. Fundamentally the racing is fun, AI on legend will test your abilities (and frustration since they love to hit you in the back), but several issues make this a love, hate thing at the moment. I would suggest buying if you're in desperate need of an F1 game, if not hold off your purchase till it's fixed (if ever) and/or a price drop.Pros:=AI much more competitive that previous game, sometimes overly so.=Graphically looks good and runs at a stable and good fps (Avg ~110 for me) on 1440p, 980Ti.Cons:=Damage model severly underwhelming (Go full speed into a wall and you will be shocked at what happen, in a bad way)=Stuck at 2nd gear after exiting the pits, unable to up or downshift until the end of the white line at the side=No race weekend weather info in championship mode (Spent practise optimising dry setup only to be greeted with a wet qualy. Game crashed during qualy, load back and it suddenly became a dry qualy)=No career mode and safety car=AI loves to crash into you from the back.=Can't find any online lobbies to play*Updated on 11 Jul to include more cons.

												Positives:- Very competitive A.I.- Decent physics (Better than F1 2014).- Better graphics than previous F1 games.- 2014 season is included. The best feature!!111!1!!one!1!one11!!Negatives:- Bad online experience.- Lack of gamemodes.- No career mode. Yes you can play the championship mode but you don't have team contracts and the other career mode features. It's different.- Still the graphics are not that great.- Bad optimization.- Bad damage model.Conclusion: It doesn't worth it to buy it for 50 euros. You'd better wait for a steam sale period and get it for less money. Codemasters can make a good F1 game but they seem to be pretty lazy or they didn't have enough time to finish it.............I'm so done with this game...			",60,2,18,0,10,2,1

												An all around disappointment. Although being an improvement from the already mediocre F1 2014, this game feels like a major let down by Codemasters. Lots of promises from them and they fail to deliver once again.PROS :-Handling model and steering has been slightly improved from 2014 with the new engine-New engine brings nicer graphics and more details to the environment-Engine sounds are as good as the real thing-AI are less passive and way more aggressive, will race you and pursue their overtaking manouver till the end-Team radio has been enhanced, and the talk to engineer voice recognition is a great ideaCONS :-Major lack of features. This game feels absolutely bland. It really hurts to see Career mode gone. Championship mode let you choose an existing driver and pretty much do their season. Gone are the days where your name would shine on the podium along big names in the sport. Pro season is pretty much a Preset Championship mode with 100% Race laps, Legend AIs and manual gears. So much for a feature right ? Multiplayer on your own is nearly impossible, nobody plays this game by the looks of it, every time you'll try to get in a Hopper session, you'll end up in a lobby by yourself and AIs. And even if you can get a few people in the lobby, the races are absolutely hideous. It feels more like a cheap Mario Kart game. Fortunately, Time Trial is still here (thank god for that) and that's about it.-No safety car. No need to explain. Why remove it ? We will never know.-AI is absolutely dumb. It was a good thing to make them competitive, but they are aggressive to the point of ignoring you on the track. I had so much drama on race starts because of the AI not taking into consideration that you are on the track and they will just push you out of the way. Before F1 2015, the AI was very defensive and weak, but the beauty of it was that they actually knew that you were on the track. On this game, it feels like they are stuck on a rail just like old racing games from the 1990's. -Damage model is non existant. Yeah, sure, if you hit the wall at least 50 times and end up losing a wheel, I guess that's what damage model is for Codemasters. Jokes aside, you'd think that in 2015, damage model would be on point and realistic with flying debris compared to older racing games but nope, ain't got time for that, right Codemasters ? You can hit the wall at 300+ kph, you'll probably just lose a wheel and the front wing, that's it. If you collide into a wall at 200kph, you'll lose your front wing, and that's about it...-Handling model and steering is appauling. When you get an oversteer, you feel like you're steering a boat. Yes, a boat. It's nearly impossible to correct a tiny oversteer or understeer just like you see in real life. When you overtake and go wheel to wheel against someone, just one hit makes you spin and go sideways. It is very frustrating. Just a tiny hit and you're off in the gravel on the opposite side of the track. VERDICT :When I was a kid playing F1 1997 on PSOne, I thought that it was the best Formula One game ever made.23 years later, I still feel like it was one the best game ever made. We are in 2015 and this game feels like a cheap excuse to release a licenced F1 game. Would be a good arcade game for younger players or people who don't have a deep knowledge of Formula One.I'm a hardcore fan and I feel like this is a disgrace to our community. I've dreamed of so much better.The game could be so much better, but nobody is dedicated enough to make it.Codemasters should lose their contract with the FIA and let another passionate studio take over the franchise and rebuild everything from scratch and make a game that actually feel like the real thing.

												EDIT 12/07/2015:So today I was excited to begin a full championship season with Williams.I selected the Championship mode, selected Legend difficulty.Like every other F1 game, I wanted to do a 25% race, with full qualifying.Well in F1 2015 you can't. If you want full qualifying, you have to do a 100% race. WHY? Why can I choose my qualy length in a single race, but not in a championship mode?Eventually I concede to doing one-shot qualy, not the end of the world.I land in the pits in Australia - the frame rate has gone to ♥♥♥♥. I exited the pit lane to a 10FPS mess.I ran a race around Silverstone on high settings at excellent frame rates yesterday, what is going on?I turned the graphics settings to low and restarted, frame rate was back to 60 FPS, but it looked horrid. Increased to medium settings - back to 10 FPS.I am done. I am requesting my refund. As you can see from my initial review below, I was willing to give the game a chance.This is unacceptable, I will not be buying a Codemasters game again.I will be playing the F1 mod on Assetto Corsa if anyone needs me.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After the disapointment of F1 2014, I expected much better this time around. CM had a lot of extra time to get this right, given how little focus was given to F1 2014I am running the game on an i5 4690k, R9 280x and from and SDD, haven't had any performance issues or crashes yet.The FFB on my G27 is average, not much feeling in low speed corners, but after 20 laps of Silverstone I am OK with it. Physics are what I expected from a CM F1 game more or less. The graphics are very disappointing, PC looks worse than the gameplay videos on youtube for PS4 and XB1. There is a weird blur on everything, nothing looks sharp.Sound is poor, isnt well mixed.I am going to keep the game, there is a solid base to be built on, hopefully CM patch it quick.This seems to be a rushed PC port. I am giving thumbs down until these issues have been resolved.Can't say I would recommend the game, but my experience is definitely not as bad as others.			",29,2,9,4,3,0,1

												Having purchased F1 games from the year dot and played all of them from Geoff Crammonds Revs right up to the recent Codemasters run (2010 to 2014) I was thrilled to see the new one come out much earlier and with a brand new engine. How disappointed I was when I finally got to play it. Where to start with the issues...Handling: It's impossible. Even for an experienced racer like me, it's utterly impossible. The car randomly vears off the track at sudden intervals that make little to no sense (on power, not on power, sometimes mid corner, sometimes late corner, sometimes on entry) its impossible to predict or correct in many instances without adding more grass to the tyres. I get it, you want it to be realistic, but lets face it, unless you are Pastor Maldonado, this is far from realistic.Forget setting up controls either, it seems Codemasters decided we didnt need those options... And my wheel just simply refuses to be detected other than as a gamepad (!!!).The menus are ridiculous too, its really really hard to navigate. It makes little to no sense and doesnt even match the previous versions of the game, so its like trying to learn something new all over again, it just adds to the sense of frustration while playing it. If that wasn't bad enough, when you start a game, the usual ESC button used in every other menu, doesnt do anything (!!!) instead I had to smash many keys until a menu came up (its P by the way).The graphics aren't even very good either, despite running a very high end PC with 16gb of ram and 970 graphics card. It looked worse than last year...Then there is the season part. Taken away completely and replaced by a single season system where you drive as one of the current drivers. Why can't I use my own damn name and race across many seasons like in previous years games?It feels like they've taken away all the flexibility of the old games, replaced the engine with something worse and made the menu system infuriating.I haven't even mentioned constant frame dips and stuttering during actually trying to stay on the track.This should be renamed ""ice truck simulator 2015"" but then perhaps that title would actually be fun instead of feeling like I've had my testicles squashed in a vice while having vinegar poured in my face (something I'd rather have than play this game in its current state).

												Codemasters! We make one step forward and dozens backwards at the same time!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------They make me feel bad and ashamed about working in the same industry!QUOTE ""Skidmeister"":F1 Race Stars is a better Formula 1 game than this......I have been a fan of Codmasters F1 and Dirt series games since the first release. I preordered this game with the information that I read over the internet from reviewers and from the Codies website. I also used my previous experience with Codmasters F1 games as a basis on what type of quality to expect from a game like this one. I have previously purchased Dirt, Dirt 2, Dirt 3, F1 2010 thru 2014 from Steam and for the most part was happy with my purchase. I am also a fan of other racing titles that are more sim than game such as IRacing, Project cars. I have enjoyed playing Race 07, Asetto Corsa except the game server on Asetto Coursa is a joke. I spent many hours in Papyrus titles like GPL and their Nascar series , and also on Geoff Crammonds World Circuit thru his GP4. I have seen both the good and bad of all these titles at their best and worst. I did not set my expectations for F1 2015 any higher than what I had seen them previously release.Common sense would dictate that a company that has been making F1 games for the PC since their September release in 2010 would have a good handle on what it takes to get a game ready to market. Common sense need not apply here. It seems with the release of F1 2015 Codmasters has indeed returned to it's roots......console gaming. This title was written with that customer in mind. The control menus are a joke with no punchline. I was never able to get both my CSW V2 wheel and Richmotech real race gear pedals to work at the same time. It is a game that really does not have a target audience and does not know where to fit in. With a shameful lack of content considering what was in previous releases, there is no safety car, interviews, career mode, co-op mode, or classic F1 cars. The sheer scarcity of options and modes means this is yet another year where the ""Official F1 tie-in"" never even gets to the starting grid. The amount of modes left out of this title is borderline criminal and scandalous. It feels like less than half a game was released at a premium price no less. They ""throw in"" the 2014 season as a bonus, because it's obvious they intend to BONE US with this title and the absense of so much of what should be seen as standard for F1. This publisher is so hell bent on hitting it's yearly release schedule that it pulled this one out of the oven half baked.I run a high end system and love to see titles push that hardware for what its worth. My current rig features a core !7-5960, 64 gb ddr4, (2) Titan X video cards in SLI, 2 ASUS G-sync 27"" monitors at a res of 5890 x 1080 bezel corrected @144 hz. Aparently I would have had better results on a console system with this title. It crashed the first few times I ran a benchmark test so bad I needed to reload my video drivers and recalibrate the monitors as this game had them stuck in limbo after multiple crashes. This game crashes more than Maldonado and Grosjean combined. The graphics looked bad even when I got them to display, but they were constantly blinking and flashing, seemingly fishing for a proper state of display this catastrophy of a game could not deliver. It looked like it was snowing in Singapore and it nearly caused me to have suffer a seizure from the constant screen blinking. Because I never was ablle to get my wheel and pedals working at the same time, even though they worked fine in all their previous titles, I can not comment on the physics. The track textures have a filtery feeling that left me nausiated as well. This game is so awkwardly stylized it's more like a bad cartoon Anime, than a racing title.I would have to say that afer a few hours of utter frustration spent trying to fix all the problems that run rampant with simple setup of this game, that the quit menu works great and that's about all. Also thats what I suggest, quit buying these half baked mess and let Codemasters know it no excuses as it is not their first rodeo, but could be their last. The best thing to do with this game is delete it permantly from your drive. There are plenty of good titles that offer proper racing that works to deal with this junk. Return it and get a refund while you can.In a side note to STEAM, shame on you too. I have been a customer for over 8 years and have never even tried to return a title. I tried multiple times to get a refund on this as I was never able to complete even one lap, but was told that beacause I had more than 2 hours of trying to fix this worthless piece of junk, that they would not refund my money. Instead opting to join their co-conspirator Codmasters in ripping of a loyal customer for short term profit. Shame on you STEAM and Codmasters, I have purchased many of your products and recommended them to my friends, alas my policy is changed on that too. I will NEVER pre purchase a title again with this return policy. I had always believed that STEAM treated their customers fairly and with respect, but I see this was yet another lesson learned from this terible gaming experience.Your money would be much better spent on the 2012 or 2013 Codemasters F1 games than this abortion of a game. I would recommend Project Cars or IRacing to anyone looking for a Racing Sim.Had either of those titles offered all the cars or tracks from the current F1 season I would have never bothered with this lackluster castrophy in the first place. Save your money and buy something else.			",284,25,25,19,11,1,20

												I've been playing the CM F1 games since 2012. 2015 is the worst of all of them. The amount of features has been scaled back too much. The graphics engine is an improvement in some ways, but is also a bit more blury. There are also quite a few graphical glitches/flickering (like grass) in spots. The AA settings are a real bummer (no more magnitude setting). None of the new console voice command features are available on the PC/Steam version. Force feedback was supposed to be improved, but it's not any better (if not worse) than 2014. But the worst is the huge amount of bugs. The game is relatively unstable. I get in-game crashing periodically, and it will ALWAYS crash when I exit. I really wanted to like this game. But it's a real disappointment. I'd return it if I didn't buy on GMG. My mistake.EDIT: To be fair, I should list some pros over the last version (2014): -The new MP options are definitely a step in the right direction, especially classifying by difficulty. -The new ""rival"" appearance in Time Trial is awesome. -Graphically it's a step sideways: It's less sharp, but overall it's prettier. Things could get a lot better with some serious patches. However, the past F1 games have had glaring bugs through their entire life, so I'll be surprised if F1 2015 is fixed-up like it should be.EDIT 2: Wait... No Track IR support? Are you kidding me? This has been a basic feature of the series for at least 4 years. Stay away from this game. Stay FAR away.			",138,31,19,5,13,1,23

												DO NOT BUY THIS!!!Worst game Codemasters have ever released!This is not a finished products - it's an engine demo, prototype, pre-alpha crap.Avoid it like a plague. For those miserable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s for whom this game actually runs, this what it's like:-- Controls are a mess. You cannot adjust most primitive control settings - button remaping for predefined controllers; deadzones, sensitivity, saturation etc for custom controllers. Hell there IS NO SUPPORT for custom controllers AT ALL!!! The game does not have any settings unless you have Logitech G27, 29 or equivalent. It's unplayable even with X360 controllers, because wheel just don't turn in, you cannot adjust sensitivity and car will get stuck in most narrow corners, scraping walls. Monaco is unplayable without high-end gaming wheels. ♥♥♥♥ing literally!-- Still on controls, they become unresponsive on random occations. Steering just becomes unresponsive, because ♥♥♥♥ you that why!-- AI ignores player and rules. Blue flags are for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! AI will not let you pass, and even fight you for position.AI loves to ram player and everything else on the track. They will push you into walls and off the track. Multiplayer seems more civil.-- speaking of multiplayer - it does not work! At all! You might get into one game every hour. There are no proper custom game lobbies, just quick jump in games. Net code is all over the damn place. Players do not sync at all. Everybody blinking all over the road, running into invisible walls and cars, changing positions etc. And you get kicked out of lobbies 9/10 times. --penalty system works in random mode. It will penalize you when you don't do anything illigal, or when AI is actually to blame. AI will bump into you, and you will recieve warnings and penalties for that. Other times it will not register anything. Even when you cut entire corners.--The new Pro mode is just regular championship mode on hard. Laziest  and most useless game mode I've ever seen.--There is no career mode anymore. No more signing teams or anything. Just get into a car and drive - season, single race or time trial. that's it. Multiplayer does not even count, because it does not work.--it does not look all that good for a new engine. Hey, have you seen Project Cars? People are in the deepest hole in uncanny valley. FPS drops for no reason. -- I haven't seen more unfinished game in a very long time. And 3 weeks after release, almost nothing has been fixed. fun times!  Just read the community hub!This should not be released for another year or two. This is not a finished product! Not even close. Not even ""beta"" finished. Not even ""early access"" finished! Come back after a year... oh wait, then there will be F1 2016 game?!Edit: Over a month since the release. Still nothing has been fixed. Now multiplayer does not work at all anymore. So it actually got worse.			",346,80,39,37,30,3,57

												I expected so much more. When Codemasters said: ""We took Mercedes' stance with regard to taking a gap year like they did in 2013 to make 2014 amazing, we did the same in 2014 to make 2015 out of this world"". But they haven't. They've taken a step back. There are constant crashes. There's still no parade lap. There's no more safety cars. Worse yet - there's no career mode for drivers who wish to live the F1 dream. They've recommended a GTX 970 as a GPU - which I have, yet the game looks smudgy at best. Sure it runs fluidly in 60 FPS, but cut scenes and replays are at 30 FPS. The bugs like missing championship points in the full season after the game crashes is pathetic. I had a 40 point lead in the championship after the game crashes, and started Round 10 with all the drivers on 0 points. But the MOST irritating thing - you can't do 25% races with full practice sessions or full qualifying. I have 300+ games to play on Steam, I don't have time to do a full race. Let me race at 25% and enjoy your game, and let me do 3 quali runs like I used to do. Is that too much to ask? You're losing my faith, Codies. I bought this game in the same hour it went on pre-order on Steam, even before you announced that it was for sale on Facebook. They've really let us down.			",254,77,50,25,64,3,43

												A game filled with promises from the developers, only to turn out to be the same old song and dance for the sixth time in a row.Somehow codemasters manage to improve one aspect of their game every year, and that's it. They find new ways to remove immersion, reduce feeling & distance you away from a solid experience.I've heavily defended this series and the developers every year since the inception of the F1 series at Codies. But this is embarrassing.The Pros:The cars are much more controllable and the handling feels much better than the last iteration.The UI is a big improvement.The Cons:The AI is awful, The Force Feedback is numb,The game is filled with graphics bugs and frame drops (frame drops unacceptable in a racing game),The anti aliasing turns on some kind of weird hazey glow around everything,The tyres don't feel like they're in contact with the road, they float about,Menus are still navigated with arrow keys, a clear sign of a direct port from console to PC,Removal of safety car,Removal of career mode,Terrible animations and awful character models.There are many more cons to pros in the game. Overall if you've played any of the other F1 games, you've played this game. Hundreds of hours into the series & nothing improves.			",110,10,29,9,21,2,11

												So the time has come. After extensive gameplay, I can finally get my conclusions on this game. Yep, it's a thumbs up review against 60% negative reviews... ouch.Okay, let's go. The first point of disappointment around the community is the lack of content that Codemasters had been announcing since October last year. They basically said that physics and handling were taken to a new level of realism, graphics were made realistic and detailed thanks to an all new engine, the player would be more involved in the action thanks the larger variety of cutscenes, a new team radio system with which you can actually interact with the engineer, 2014 season for free, more online modes, two brand new full championship modes, car technical updates as they come in real life... Promising, isn't it? If we look into the game and play it, the guys at Codemasters haven't said a lie. Well, just one: They haven't laid any car update since the day-1 patch, which included team Manor and McLaren's new livery  (what about the new Mercedes rear wing, Force India nosecone, McLaren new short nosecone, Ferrari new sidepods...?). With that exception, everything they said is in the actual game.  - Handling, physics and tyre model is just amazing. Seriously, it really is. F1 games are no longer a lazily built arcade with random curb spin and nonexistent grip feel on turns and braking points, but and incredibly detailed simulator-like which transmits the power of the cars in all its glory. Now you have torque wheelspin which you can correct with quick steering movements to put the car straight and make it find grip, which makes the car nervous as in real life. - Some people moan about the inability to change dead zone and saturation setups on wheels and pads. I have mixed opinions about that: For compatible devices like the Xbox 360/One pad or the main wheels on the market like Logiteg G27/29 or certain Thrustmaster devices the developer has brought a preset setup which adapts to what they want the game to handle like. Change the settings and you completely ruined the car behaviour. On the other hand, this has a drawback. If you have a wheel which hasn't got a preset, forget about ever trying to use it with this game. It would be nice to set up a comfortable setting for it because Force Feedback will mess around and steering will be completely unrealistic and close to impossible. - Most PC users report constant bugs. I haven't found any type of glitch during my gameplay, of any kind. Try checking out your GPU drivers before directly blaming the game. Some Youtubers and users make ""bug compilation"" videos and screenshots of gross bugs with the initial version of the game, without the Day-1 patch. That's not fair, and don't take them into account. If you really want to get feedback about glitches, ask people, document yourself with patch fixes and the PC those users have and their drivers version. Again, I haven't found any bug in like 40 hours of gameplay. - Setups are much deeper and they change realistically the behaviour of the car, mostly because the physics take into account many more real-time factors like, say, a fully working weight balance system. Now it comes with five setup presets which you can choose to adapt the car to the circuit you are at plus you can save your own. Tyre model is now enhanced and integrates a much more complex tyre wear system, so choosing the right setup makes a huge difference in tyre management.  - As to graphics, what they made was basically go back to the F1 2010 model which consisted in using light effects to make beautiful and realistic scenes, but of course they've enhanced textures, added some nice motion blur, a long awaited ambient occlusion and refined colours. Rain effects are also enhanced and rather impressive, and night circuits have a much more accurate reflections and lighting effect.  - Sounds make a big difference and are probably one of the fields that have been worked out the most. The engine has an impressive range of sounds, from the dynamic roar of the V6 along the revs panorama to the subtle whistle of the turbo, including the electric engines' distinctive sound. Aero sounds are more detailed and go further from the strange noise that sometimes appeared on the previous games when attempting to make it. There's the reverb of the sound when getting close to walls and barriers and more detailed tyre squeak, among other cool effects. Team radio is at its best, providing useful information and with a larger variety of sentences. Now let's move to the drawbacks, because it doesn't matter how much you're enjoying this game, they're there as a wound. Where to begin... Oh, yeah. The optimization.Unlike the rest of the games by Codemasters, F1 2015 is really, really, really badly optimised (I mean, really). Seriously, I don't know what they did there. Frame rate will be the same on the lowest settings as on the Highest, and some tracks have some nasty drops at some points. Pit Stops are somehow capped to some ridiculous 15 FPS and after leaving the pit lane you're back at the normal frame rate. Thank God you haven't got to do anything during pit stops, because otherwise it would have been impossible. Some patches have improved performance and frame rate is more stable now. Game is fully playable though, so no need to panic. I'd take the excuse that this is their first title under the all-new-bright-and-shiny graphics engine so they haven't had enough time to make it as perfect as the previous EGO engine was by the last games it powered...  - Online. Man, this is by far the worst part of the game. Well, you can't even say it is a part of the game, because it's just broken. As if it wasn't there. No online. One of the additions to this game is, as said before, a new bunch of online game modes, ""hoppers"" as they call them. These are simply preset lobbies, so you can enter any type of race you want. Looks good, huh? Nope. It doesn't make it easier to find the exact race setting you want, although not because of the game, but the very few people that switches to online. Enter a hopper: No lobbies. Different hopper: No lobbies. Another hopper: Enter a lobby. Lobby already racing ( -.- ).There's also the custom match lobby, of course, but for some reason it cannot be public (only friend invite). Don't want to lose time searching open lobbies and you just want to go online? NOPE! For some reason, they removed the ""Joker"" of Quick Matchmaking. Manage to enter a lobby and start racing? NOPE! Bound to be kicked from session. To be fair, Codemasters has never had proper servers. 70% of the times in F1 2012 you or anyone else in the lobby would get Disconnected. DiRT 3 was glitchy at some points. But these issues in F1 2015 aren't even normal. - The lack of Safety Car, to be honest, doesn't make any difference at all. I have around 200 hours of playtime in F1 2012 and most of the time I play 25%-50% races. Haven't seen a single Safety Car. If so, some red flags. If from 2012 to 2014 the Safety Car was as common as seeing a four-leaved shamrock, why not having it in 2015 is a big deal? My point of view is that the damage system is so bad that there's no reason to lay the Safety Car on track. Massive incident, front wing and wheels off, car and parts disappear, resume racing. With the new graphics engine they could have enhanced the damage system to add debris on track that could cause punctures, gravel spread on the tarmac, marshals picking up pieces... In those occasions it would be easier and reasonable to deploy the Safety Car, but as the damage system only added more realism on flatting tyres against walls and more parts of the front wing that you can lose, there's no reason to do. That's a disappointing drawback, the damage system.F1 2015 is enjoyable. You'll notice the difference to the previous games from the first moment. 7.5/10			",81,10,13,2,6,1,3

												Its moments like this you realise that PC doesn't matter to developers. While the console versions ships with few issues, the PC version is just broken for some people which to me says that the game just wasn't tested enough... if at all since the issues are huge.Championship mode would run in 8fps for me - regardless of graphic settingsMultiplayer wouldn't find a game (on fibreoptic broadband). The one time it did, it ran at 8fps - regardless of graphic settingsTime Trials worked like a dream, 60fps on the highest settings and more importantly I enjoyed the racing.I should imagine that when codies have pulled their fingers out the game will be great and I'll probably repurchase itbut until they 've done the work, no chance.In conclusion- the game will be fun when it finally works. The cars have a nice feel and the graphics are nice.There are a lot of people talking about blurriness in the graphics, I believe its called chromatic arbetration.There wasn't anywhere to custom search a multiplayer race- in other words I couldnt search Monaco/fullrace/fullweekend/no assists etc. The search options are pre-determined which isnt good.Since I didnt play a huge amount of the game this review is more about the dissatisfaction that I wasn't told it didnt work and spent £35.99 on a game.Don't these developers have morals anymore? Thanks for the refund steam and thanks for making me aware that I now have a second job being a games tester. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

			F1 2015 for the PC XBoxOne and PS4 is the latest Formula one offering by CodeMasters. Having heard good things about this game during its development we thought we would throw some cash at our PC...		

- Should I buy F1 2015 ?On PC as of right now no probably not - How good are the graphics in F12015 and how well does it run ?Many people on PC are having issues getting stable performance from the game, though code masters recent patches have improved things a bit. For us we have gotten moderately good performance from the game with it looking reasonably nice. Games like project cars look far nicer though especially in-terms of dynamic weather and other PC racers like AC iRacing and GSC could run on a calculator whilst still looking crisp though lacking in as many track side details as F1 2015. - What is the best thing about F1 2015  ?Nice car track and human models that make you feel like you are at an F1 race- What is the Worse thing about F1 2015 ?The game crashes far to often , mostly when doing championship mode or when closing the game, moving from multiplayer back to the menus also sometimes causing the game to hang forcing you to close the game. - What are the are the cars like to drive in F1 2015 ?They feel more progressive than the older F1 games, and far more forgiving, but at the same time they seem quite sloppy to pull out of slides. Fans of driving games like Assetto corsa ,GSC,RF2 or iRacing would probably describe the cars in F12015 as being boat-like. - What are the AI like in F1 2015 ?The AI are not the worse relative to other driving games, but they are certainly not the best. Sometimes you can have good racing with them , other times they will make strange moves or brake on corners where you would not expect it. I think if you were playing as a casual player the AI fine but if you were investing serious time into it then the AI will make you want to pull your teeth out. - Is Codemasters F1 2015 fun ?If it didn't crash and you can look past the lack of content as well as the UI and all the other issues then I can still see many people having fun with this though probably more so on the console than on the PC and more so with a game pad.

												Blatant false advertising (alleged ""new engine"" is still really ego engine) and cut back on features are just some examples of why this game is a huge disappointment.technical:-bloom that cannot be disabled-blur tied to AA means either live with blurry graphics or have extreme aliasing-very poor perfomance even with recommended hardwaresingleplayer:-career removed-no effort put into championship mode whatsoever, literally just spawns you on track-legend AI can be outraced without any real effort-no time attack scenarios, no classic content, no coop mode, no splitscreenmultiplayer:-get kicked all the time for no apparent reason-preset modes instead of free choice of lobbys-horrible matchmaking system-extremeley buggy (wrong results and times appear at the end of a session)-players cars get replaced with AI controlled cars randomly-wrong results shown in end screen-out of sync gameplay (finish first, in reality be 5th)Conclusion: Codemasters has tried a step forward by introducing an update to their ego engine, but has made a step back with literally any feature there is in the game, besides cutting tons of features from previous installments. False advertsing claiming ""new features"" which really aren't new at all make this not only a bad game, but a mocking of any honest paying customer.Do not buy.			",63,1,10,2,3,0,4

												Game is straight broken. I remember when codemasters used to release a game, and I got excited. Well it seems like those days are long gone. Game is buggy, crashes, multiplayer is broken, and honestly does not look ""next gen"" as they keep saying. Multiplayer goes something like this. 1. attempt to connect to friend. Get disconnected 2. try again. get disconnected. 3. Try 4 more times. 4. get into game, and start qualifying. 5. watch the ai take control through the pits, and  bomb you into the wall in turn one. 5. drive around until you can pit. 6. pit, and start to race. 7. finish the race in first on your screen, but end up in 3rd on the podium because the game does not sync correctly in multiplayer. 8. Go to steam and request a refund. 9. write a review, and hope that this game gets removed from steam. Honestly the game is not even ready for early access. codemasters should be ashamed of themselves.			",223,24,33,18,30,1,18

												As a big fan of F1 I am very disappointed with this effort. Wheel supportFirstly, my G27 had no FFB out of the box. I was able to get some FFB by turning it up in the profiler but it feels completely wrong. It's more like a dull resistance than feedback. Secondly unlike every other racing game this game does not automatically set the correct turning angle which means a lot of messing about in the profiler again to get the in game wheel to match up with my real wheel.GraphicsFor a game with such high recommended specs (which my PC meets) the graphics are poor. Nowhere near the level of Project Cars or Assetto Corsa. If a game is recommending a GTX970 it better look amazing. What are they doing with all that processing power? The only conclusion is that this game is very badly optimised. As many people have noted there is a strange blurred look to the graphics too.SummaryLooks like another cash-grab from CM. They have a track record of releasing broken games but I really thought the step into next gen (not that I would call this game next gen) would be different. I have requested a refund for the first time ever on Steam. Usually, I would hold out for a patch but again CM have a track record of never really fixing anything in their patches so I don't anticipate that these issues will be solved. Prove me wrong CM and i'll re-buy the game, I really want to be proved wrong.			",23,0,11,2,9,0,2

												Having played F1 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013, F1 2015 was a huge disappointment. First off, there is no career mode. Yes, you read that right; NO CAREER MODE! The closest option to it sees you driving the season as one of the current drivers on the grid. Graphics do not appear to have changed much if at all since F1 2013. It looks pretty decent, but there is a strange hazy look over everything and some textures are still quite blurry, particularly the steering wheel. Then you have the most important aspect - the driving/handling. After all the previews I read, I expected the handling and feedback to feel really good, but the reality is shockingly bad. With feedback settings turned all the way up, there is hardly anything there. It is by far the most arcade-like driving feel of the Codemasters F1 games to date. The race optoins seem to be dumbed down as well. It seems you are even limited to 25%, 50%, or 100% race distances, nothing in-between. Then there are issues with controls. After customizing my Logitech MOMO Racing wheel in the settings menu, it worked well enough the first time. After quitting out of the game and relauching, it no longer detects my wheel at all. I even tried removing all game settings files and uninstalling/reinstalling the entire game to no avail.This game is a broken shell of its former self that is lacking in nearly every way. It has been stripped of the best game mode. The menu options have been dumbed down even more than they were in F1 2013. I was really looking forward to the revamped, latest iteration of what has been one of my favorite racing series. I have never been so disappointed in a game.			",20,6,6,9,3,0,2

												Absolutely shocking game. Awful. Get a PS2 and play F1 2006 or get F1 2010. No ""immersive"" experience, Pro Season Mode is terrible. No career mode, although that has been sub standard to say the least before. I hope Codemasters lose the rights to this as this was a joke. Maybe charge €15 euro next year as a starting price and maybe people will buy it.They don't even deserve detailed feedback anymore as it's a joke of a game. Get rFactor and use the mods instead.

												It's bugged, it lacks depth, and it's no improvement over its predecessors. In fact, without a career mode, you could argue it's a step back. How can DIRT be so good, even in early access, and yet F1 2015 be so bad in its supposedly 'finished' state? Just a terribly lacklustre effort. Does anyone on the Codemasters team have even the slightest interest in F1? Does Codemasters actually want to make a good F1 game, or are they happy churning out the same steaming pile every year?

												Right... I was determined not to let the reviews of others sway my opinion when buying the game but I'm afraid many of my complaints are widely shared by others in the community.Previously I had played F1 2010 & F1 2011 and had really enjoyed the game despite not having a full race wheel setup instead I was using an accellerometer based wheel (Simraceway SRW-S1) so when I bought myself a Logitech G29 I was eager to race in this pc series. Unfortunately F1 2011 did not work properly on Windows 10 so I bought F1 2015 on sale and was considerably unimpressed.The first thing I noticed was the graphics were not all they were hyped up to be. The next and IMO the most important thing I noticed was the FFB. Coming from Hundreds of Hours of Project Cars, I was crushingly dissapointed by the FFB. After tinkering with the settings to try and find the optimum setting for my wheel I soon realised it was the way the game sent the FFB signals that was the problem. Basically all you can feel is oversteer and bumps; both are very crude and imprecise and the result is a car that feels like it is floating along and easy to steer through High G turns and feels like a tank when going over bumps. Getting the FFB right like when you find the sweet spot in pCars can allow you to feel your way through a track but unfortunately the game will leave you numb to any sligt movement in the car. I know people have been praising the physics; and whilst I have not tried out the previous games I feel like the physics were another thing that was over-hyped. The breaking doesn't respond with enough sensitivity and despite being a bad driver in 12 hours I have not spun out on a kerb or the white line where as in F1 2011 it was a regular occurence. In terms of the UI I have no complaints and because of the FFB being so crippling I don't really think the game has the playability to warrant any complaints from me about the lack of game modes and the like so I won't touch on it. Even on sale I feel let down and havin gplayed some of the Grid games as well I feel that Codies have definitely lowered their standards and have cemented themselves as the lazy, greedy company that will spit out an unfinished game quickly which get progressively worse as time passes.

												One word. Bad.I don't have the performance issues some have been having, that said on two GTX980's I expected more than 80fps (I am trying to play at 144, excuse my first world problem) for a game engine that looks exactly the same as each previous installment (with a layer of vaseline over the top). I also challenge the claim they've overhauled the physics engine, it doesn't feel any different than even F1 2012. I had high hopes for the handling model given how well they're doing with Dirt Rally. Boy was my hope misplaced.However there are a couple of glaring issues besides the general ""meh"" ness of the above. The quality of the tracks has decreased dramatically. They just feel subpar, like they spent all their budget on marketing and FOM licenses instead of getting a team out to the tracks to actually make them accurate. As an example the first bend at Suzuka is flat. FLAT. I'm all for non-laser scanned tracks, but only as long as they actually put in some effort.The other is the utter madness that is controller support. The wheel works fine, at least as far as it recognises basic inputs, but the game will not under any circumstance recognise my Fanatec Clubsport pedals connected to my GT2 wheel or to the PC via usb. Absolute garbage. I mean this is real basic race sim stuff right here, and they got it right for ALL their games in the last 3-4 years, and now somehow they stuff it up? I mean really?Refund and avoid.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been driving with a Thrustmaster T300RS to test this game and here are my experiences so far:- Graphics:Graphics are just an update. Nothing to great to mention IMHO. It's still way off other titles regarding racing simulations.- Gameplay:No coop, no career. Menu got better.- Sound:Nothing worth mentioning either. Cars sound okay, good thing is that you can hear tyre squeal.- PhysicsThe car behaves good in general. Reactions are fast and accurate, BUT why, Codemasters, can't you ever manage a decent Force Feedback?! I mean seriously, they've been working on F1 titles for the last 6 years and I have never been pleased with the FFB (only skipped F1 2014 so far)! It's weak and simply not accurate at all. Take racing simulations from other devs as an example and start getting to work, it's simply embarrassing!Wheelspin is pretty aggressive, which is good, but I can't really control it, which is caused by my bad pedals, too, I'm afraid. But you can compromise a little with setup and wheel settings.- Setup:I could never trust Codemasters' setups in F1 titles and the same goers for F1 2015. The settings just don't influence the handling in the way they should. You simply can't create an individual setup for your personal driving style, which has been a problem since the series started in 2010.In addition to that, you can't change the braking balance in the setup and the description of weigth distribution says, that if you change it to the front you assist understeer. Codemasters, that is simply NOT TRUE, since it supports OVERSTEER if there is less weigth on the rear! This is almost as ludicrous as the settings for rear anti-roll bars in your past titles, where stiffening them caused better traction!- AI:AI got pretty aggressive, which is good. But the bad thing is that it got pretty ""derby"". It's alright if AI drivers do mistakes, but I won't accept an AI which spins me off track while driving straight, especially if I voluntarily let the drivers past.- Car damage:Touching the wall ""not-so-gently"" while driving straight with 250+ km/h and having neither front wing damage nor suspension damage...Need I say more? Here you go: Touching the rear of an AI-Car while breaking, no damage to my car. Ridiculous.- Bugs:Breaks are broken, according to status screen, as soon as I exit the pits.Tyres get cold immediately after releasing the throttle. That's way too fast!Again just ONE training session. But, according to rumours, BEFORE the day one patch there have been three...Seems that codemasters cancelled them afterwards.Crashes when performing an ingame Benchmark-test and when exiting the game.Sorry, Codies, but you won't get any more money from me. I have better things to spend that 50 bucks on, seriously....			",53,17,3,13,6,0,8

												+ Great graphics+ Super fun and Challenging to drive the cars+ AI has improved a lot, but there is still some things negative about them (which I will point out on the negativ points)+ Runs very smooth with my i5 and GTX 970 with minimum 60 fps every time- No Safety Car / No Formation Lap and Career Mode- Podium is the same every time, and winning the Championship is only slightly different- Tyrewear seems to be non existing for the AI - AI can't handle cold tyres at all, which results in overtaking them easily after a pitstop- AI likes to ignore Blue Flags - When an AI tries to lap others in Monaco for example they are just stuck behind them for several rounds- AI being stuck in the pit and both cars from a team pitting on the same lap making the 2nd car lose time, because he have to wait- The 2nd gear glitch, which destroys your engine- The damagemodel didn't change at all and compared to reality this is just not real at allOverall there are much more negative points than positive ones, but I'm a fan of the F1 series and it just looks way better than 2014. I'm a type of person, who did only play Career Mode, but I prefer better graphics over the same graphics the last 4 years and having the current lineup of drivers. What really wonders me is the removal of the Career Mode, because they can't deliver it on a good level. Well... I drove with my name on F1 2013 and the Overall on my Lotus had the name of Grosjean and a French flag.So why do you remove a mode, which did not had improvements since 2011 and didn't change any visual things either.Just gonna hope for a real improvement in modes for F1 2016.

												Note:This review is based on playing with a Ferrari F1 Wheel Integral T500Controls with a controller are pretty mediocre, so if that's your thing, I recommend 2013.Pros:Greatly improved handling - it just feels a lot more fluent and fun to driveImproved FFB - rain races are a lot better now compared to 2014AMAZING tire model - Tire management really is a thing now, you'll get rewarded for looking after your tires (harder for controller users, benefiting wheel users)Improved time trial - Leaderboads now offer you to copy someones setup, so you can really see who's betterContent - Might not seem like a big deal, but you got 2015 and 2014 seasons availableImproved AI behaviour - AI is more aggressive, they don't back out like in the old games and can actually overtake you nowCons:No career mode - No big deal for me, but a huge letdown for some peopleNo Safety Car - Kinda sucks, but better for multiplayer actually, since people liked to abuse itMultiplayer - Public lobbies with lots of issues, private lobbies via invites mostly working fineWeather forecast - No forecast for the whole weekend, only the present dayDamage model - Though the engine was improved, the damage model is more or less the same as before, which is disappointingAI difficulty - A bit too low for me, balance between cars isn't good (Mercedes AI extremely overpowered, rest is really slow)Conclusion:The game surely isn't perfect and needs quite some work, but aside from the bugs, which can be really annoying sometimes, this is definitely the best codemasters game yet. Make sure to pick it up on a sale though.Overall, I've had more fun than frustration playing this game so far, so I'm gonna recommend it!If you aren't sure, I suggest waiting some more time before buying it.

												Updated Review 28th of May 2016:Is this a good game? NOShould you buy it? Only if you like being angry, frustrated and hate fun.Is there anything good? Well the graphic is okay. And if F1 is your thing, ""happy days"".So what is the issues with the game?Well there are many.1) No single player campaign, you only play a season as a one of the current drivers2) The multiplayer has many missing features  A) No safety car  B) No Full Qualifying (But is part of single player, so why not Multiplayer?)  C) You can't rejoin a session  D) You can't restart a race without, redoing everything again.  E) Coming out of the PIT, the game will control your car - great. Whats not great is it doesn't inform you when you get control. Often just as you hit the first corner, making it a ♥♥♥♥ show.   F) Odd lags, that happens add random. Played a match with a friend, first race he had ton of lag - restarted the race and suddenly it was me getting. Where it freezes your car, so everybody else passes you.etc.3) Penalty system that is, to me, so faulty its game breaking.  A) Getting penalty - without prior warnings.   B) Getting penalties for AI ramming you from behind. Which happen often  C) Getting warnings for corner cutting while driving on a straight line   D) Inconsistency: 2 Corner cutting warnings on 15 laps = 5secs penalty. Friend gets 9-10 warnings on 8 laps = 3 secs penaltyetc.AND THE BIG ONE!4) AI, stupid god damn horrifying turd of an AI. The majority of the time they have no clue where you are or that you exist. They will ram you for no reason, even when they have ton of space to pass. Monaco is a prime example of this and the penalty system that is so unjust that its on a ""delete this ♥♥♥♥ now!"" kind of level.The AI is the main reason why I hate this game, why I recommend no one buy this game. The AI is the soul reason why F1 2015 is one of the worst racing games I have played. It destroys every single drop of fun this game has to offer. When racing large tracks it becomes a bit lets - but a track like Monaco becomes unplayable for me.In short: The AI feels like its take from a Destruction Derby game.So no I don't like this game, I don't recommend it, I don't want anybody to be filled with so much rage as me from playing against Codemasters excuse of an AI. Original Rage review:I hate this game, so much. The AI is ♥♥♥♥ poor and takes all the fun out of it.Most of the time they have no situational awareness and they often drive more like destruction derby than F1. So no matter if I have good race, AI will usually find a way to ram me off the track.And the penalty system is odd, giving me corner cutting warning while driving straight or penalties when its the AI that rams you.

												So far so crap.Within the time constraints of Steams refund system I had to try to get this game working well and within 50 minutes I gave up, and here's why.It ran at the v sync level of 60 fps with frame rate drops that made it not fun to play. Even a few fps is enough to ruin the experience. Turn the settings down I hear you say. The problem is the frame rate drops occurred whether I was running in 3440 x 1440 Ultrawide or 1080p. Exactly the same drops at the same points of the track and even when I set everything to low. It does not hold a steady 60fps in the game. The benchmark works fine, it's even the same track. I get average 88fps on the ultrawide format with everything maxed, but not in game.My sytem specs ATM are as follows :- 2 x GeForce GTX Titan X 12GB cards- CPU: Intel Core i7 4790K Overclocked to 4.8GHz - Motherboard: Asus Maximus VII Formula Z97X- RAM: Avexis Blitz 16GB 2400MHz C10- Samsung 840 Evo 1TB SSD- Seagate Barracuda 2TB SATA-III Hard Drive- LG 16x Blu Ray writer- OS: Microsoft Windows 8.1 64-Bit- Super Flower Leadex Platinum 1200W Power Supply- Dell Ultrasharp 21:9 Curved monitor- Fully water cooled inside and out :-)I've ran the game with and without SLi on and I get the exact same fps and with the drops too. It's clearly not right.Track-IR does not work which would be something sorely missed after enjoying that in previous F1 titles.Backgrounds pass by like they are being shown on a flip book, there's a certain amount of stutter, flashing that's hard to describe, it's more of a feeling than something you can see if you get my drift. It just doesn't feel smooth even when it is running at 60fps, again that's with and without SLi on.EDIT : Well the FPS drops have gone now, for some odd reason the game has started to run smoothly in that sense. But the backgrounds still pass by like they are on a flick book, especially Albert Park. It's the trees that seem to have a weird shadow issue that makes the game look jerky. I decided to keep the game and hope that things get sorted out because the basics are there to suggest a good game will be possible eventually.			",174,31,21,12,28,3,5

												Having purchased all the previous Codemasters F1 games and played them competively in online leagues, I actually approached this one with some quiet optimism for once, naively thinking that CM would pull out all the stops for this ""next gen"" title. Unfortunately, my hopes have been dashed for the 2nd year in a row. F1 2014 was a complete disaster and now F1 2015 ranks up there amongst the worst. (Not that F1 2010/11/12/13 were without glitches)Firstly, the positives: 2014 season is included. This is good, CM have included the full '14 season with all the teams and tracks. It's a nice addition that does add some depth to the game. The new handling model is less forgiving than F1 2014 and certainly better than F1 2013. (Using a wheel at least) I can't speak about the FFB because my wheel doesn't have any, but the handling is exciting, the car slides out from under you under braking and it is difficult to accelerate out of low speed corners. On the other hand, there is a real sense of grip at high speed corners.  The car models themselves look very good, with all the steering wheels this time round. Although I haven't tested it fully, the AI seems to be quicker and more aggressive offline.Unfortunately, these improvements are offset by a myriad of problems. Here are the negatives: Graphics are overall quite poor, aside from the cars, everything is permeated by a strange blur. CM's awful filter returns Wheel support is poor. I have had a lot of problems with keys randomly rebinding - to such an extent that I have to use my keyboard to navigate the menus Voice command support is confusing - I'm still not sure if I am able to use it. Online is broken. Ghost cars are back - proper, competitive online racing is impossible at the moment because people's cars do not synchronise properly. I might be racing through Becketts, but on someone elses screen I'll be 20 seconds further back. AI is slower online it seems. Glitches when exiting the pits, the car will randomly shift into 2nd gear even with pit assist off. Corner cutting is AGAIN an issue. It's so lenient that anyone could shave seconds off their lap times by cutting corners without gettting penalised. This really is disgraceful considering it is CM's 6th attempt at an F1 game. No co-op or career mode. Also no custom helmets online. Audio is boring and flat too. There's other glitches too, but there are too many for me to remember off the top of my head.Overall, this is a truly dismal effort by CM. After so many years Codemasters are still failing at the basics which is truly awful for a company that has spent years churning out F1 games. Something must be fundamentally wrong in the development process for this game to have got cleared through quality control. A very basic testing of online functionality would have revealed that this game was not fit for release.If you just want a very casual playthrough with the latest cars and circuits then this is the game for you. If you want a more in depth experience then steer clear of this wreckage.If this CM was an F1 driver it would be Pastor Maldonado: Somehow still involved with the sport despite constantly disappointing us all time and time again.

												(Update: a workaround for the controller issue exists - plug in the controller after launching the game. Then the default mapping works as intended, and you can enjoy the much-improved handling. Given the number of other issues that people are experiencing I'd still hold fast for a while if you're not willing to risk it, but the game itself is really enjoyable when it all works fine) Well, the launch of F1 2015 has been somewhat disasterous. Every platform has had major bugs, none more than PC. Issues with controls, instability, FPS drops, derpy AI... Thankfully, a couple of patches have already released, which fixed some of the crashes and problems with gamepads. The gamepad issue is game-breaking for me - the default controller mapping leaves the brakes locked on, and remapping them leaves no deadzone, making the car difficult to control.The game shows a lot of promise - the AI are far more aggressive than earlier games, and the graphics are pretty. Unfortunately in its current state it's nigh on impossible to play, and I cannot recommend it until Codemasters fixes the major issues.			",85,13,10,8,6,2,7

												Recently I played few great racing games. Dirt Rally, Project CARS, Assetto Corsa... if you're waiting for me to mention F1 2015... well, it's not going to happen. Gameplay in F1 is decent, it's a good balance of simulation and casual racing and I loved the game when I was testing it by driving some time trials on good old tracks. However, when I started my first season, won my first pole and started a race, game kicked me in a head, then hit me one more time when I was on the floor. AI is absolutely terrible! It's like I'm playing Carmaggedon. I played not more than 5 single player races and 5 times ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI spined me like police when chasing the bad guys or just hit me from behind. When I'm overtaking AI, they are like my ex-girlfrend - they just can't let go. Okay, I still got multiplayer and this should be a lot of fun. Oh, wait, there are 3 sessions online! One for begginers where guy just stays at the starting grid every race, one decent but overcrowded and one with experienced drivers where I look like carting driver vs Sebastian Vettel.

AVOID! Codies Worst F1 Game EVER!So, I've been a long time fan of Codies F1 series. I've owned F1 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, so of course, it was a no brainer I would get F1 2015. Now, F1 2015, I can say without any doubt that it is the worst F1 game Codies has ever made. I haven't experienced the optimization issues some have, I'm running it at 1080p, every setting maxed and getting around 110-120 FPS (SLI 980's.) The game does look better than previous years, but is worse in just about every other way it can be.With this game, Codies have removed the career mode. This was already known before release, but is still a huge disappointment, as the championship mode to replace it is extremely lacking. The physics and damage are absolutely abyssmal. It drives worse than any other F1 game I've ever played. I noticed how bad the damage was (This is with it on full, too.) so I drove into a wall at full speed in Australia. My front wing broke off, and the rest of the car was fine. Absolutely ridiculous. The cars handle like boats and are terrible to drive. I use a Thrustmaster T500RS wheel. In all previous games, I've set force feedback to around 50% and it has been perfect,  I could get a good amount of feedback through the wheel and it felt very realistic. Now, with the new game, I have everything in 100% and I can barely feel anything. There's a slight vibration and nothing more with everything maxed out. The car drives like a donkey and when force feedback is essentially non-existant, welp, it becomes almost impossible to drive.Now, let's get into the fun (not really) that is online. Online is completely broken right now. I joined a lobby for a standard sprint race earlier. 5 of us in the lobbies, no races yet. Apparently I had already got 25 points whilst everyone else was at 0 (As I should have been, since there were no races completed yet.) Then I got into the race. Every car that was around me disappeared upon race start. I thought I was alone on the track, nobody showed on the track or the map, and I appeared to be all alone. Then at the end of lap 2, the fastest lap time shows, and it's the driver who started behind me. Yep. I finish the race and apparently on this empty track the other guy finished ahead of me by just over 1 second and won the race, giving me 2nd and 18 points, however, since I already started with 25 points out of nowhere, I was winning the championship by 18 points still. Oh, and I forgot to mention, from start to end of that race, my car was semi-transparent and flickering constantly, which was annoying and very distracting.F1 has had some releases that weren't that great (Looking at you, 2014), but none that weren't enjoyable (even if it did take mods to make them as fun as they should be.), every game so far I've found to be worth what I paid for it. Every game except for this one. As a long time F1 fan and fan of racing games, I hate to have to say that this is the last time I ever buy an F1 game so long as Codemasters owns the licence for F1 games. They have completely butchered it in every way imaginable and more. Codemasters, I doubt you'll read this, but I hope you do, just so you know how much you've destroyed what was my favourite racing game series.I do not reccomend this game to anyone, and I advise you not to buy it, as you will be far better off playing literally any earlier F1 game.

												For ♥♥♥♥'s sake Codemasters I knew there was a high posibility of not delivering much inovation to the series, but you seriously gave the gamers a ♥♥♥♥ing downgraded game! I mean how more could you ♥♥♥♥ this up? I think I can't be more dissapointed since my expectations are so low. How on earth can you give your customers a product such as F1 2015? And I am not even mentioning the bugs that come with the game (which luckily did not occure in my game)!Since I started with a negatively very bad introduction I'll try to talk about the pros. First of all the number one thing I was desprately waiting for was the inprovment of the AI cars. This year i could finally say the AI cars are a challenge and gives the game a tromendous amount of depth which makes the races attractive in so many levels compared to the previous F1 games from Codies, but it took them 5 years to improve such a basic gameplay tool that should be a priority in every racing game! And ladies and gentlemen that's about it when it comes to gameplay improvment.There is also an improvment in the graphics and it's nice to see a visual difference between F1 2015 and previous F1 games. I could insist it looks next gen, but it isn't mind blowing. Now the cons: It seemed to me that the developers were mostly interested in the graphic upgrade such as better looking environments, drivers faces and the engineers ,which is completely pointless since all of the character models are acting the same just like in other pre-race start. It definitely does not make my Formula 1 experience more authentic regardlessly on how much the graphics are in depth of detail. If I get to see the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over again it just gets annoying (same thing about the Crofty's commentary). I'd rather just have a simple menu were I could use my imagination instead of forcing my self to enjoy something I'm used to see a lot of amount of times. Some drivers do look pretty neat and some do look literally disgusting like for example Maldonado's face is so ugly that I feel sorry for the driver.The worst thing about this game is the missing content. At first I was amazed by racing for the first couple of laps, but after trying to play a different single player mode instead of just playing quick race, champions mode or time trail I started to realize there is nothing really else to do in this game, but wait you say there is multiplayer? Well i say multiplayer is pure ♥♥♥♥. I spent a week playing this game and I could not even once find a multiplayer session. Codemasters won't let you even create an open lobby session, You can only play with your freinds, but if you wanna race with the rest of the world you can use their ""innovative"" multiplayer modes which don't have a single player in it!And the last thing I would like to mention is one of the important aspect of the game that has a big part on how the game runs is the LACK OF SAFETY CAR. I have simply no words for not including such an important game feature that was in the previous games. You say it will be patched sooner or later? That makes it look like that the game is still in early access alpha god damn it!When it comes to gameplay features this game is definetly fun, but this innovative feature of the game cannot save it from the overall lack of content. In the end this is just an average game and there is nothing really special about it. I'd give this game 3/5  if the multiplayer would work well  and if they wouldn't take out some of the important gameplay features such as a red flag or the safety car.FINAL VERDICT: 2/5Oh and I spent about 50 hours playing this game on my other steam account.

												Pro's: - Graphics; it gets more realistic every year and 2015 is no exception- Stable game - I heard people had problems with error 41's or crashes to desktop: haven't had any.- Realistic driving, pro season got me 4 laps behind - then again I suck without ABS so it should be this way. AI is fun to drive against (although too aggresive at times)Con's:- Bugs. A lot of them. I feel like being a beta tester, but then I'm not paid or am aware of the game being in beta state. Surely every game has its glitches post-release, but there's a difference between nuisances or game breakers. Gamebreakers are being patched alright, but they shouldn't have existed in such amounts. One or two can happen, five is way too much- Online still hasn't been fixed, 3 weeks after release. One should think racing games such as these have a large multiplayer community...Can't find lobbies, especially the hardcore hopper. And whose idea was it to remove the custom lobbies?- Omitting the career and coop mode. Does this have something to do with the ever-present profile corruption bug? Instead of fixing it, removing it?. Coop was a lot of fun, even with total strangers. It's hidden in the online mode (manually lobby with a friend, then pick the races), but the option has gone from the menu.- Did I mention a lot of bugs?F1 2013, my previous, was a lot better than this game; the only positive I can find is that the cars are handling better, Codemasters should make F1 2016 (2017?) a better game, if not I suspect the Codemasters series will lose its fanbase, and rightly so. I hope they'll be like Williams (2013-2014): after a suckass game, make a great one. ",56,17,12,20,8,0,4

												Basically the game doesn't work with my Driving Force GT. Wheel weight is featherlight and basically unuseable with zero FFB no matter what settings I try. Others also seem to have the same problem though no solution has been found yet. Of course it will likely be for the community to fix this and I have no faith in Codemaster's (what a joke of a copany name) post release support.Currently unplayable (for me) 0/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Damn I wanted to like this so much. As an avid follower of F1 and a racing game enthusiast, I had some hopes in the new physics and their work in FFB... But it shouldn't be.After playint time trial in a Ferrari F15-T on Silverstone using a Logitech G27, I can say the following:-FFB feels atrocious. No info. No feeling of load on any axle. No feel for grip loss. It vibrates when you are off-track though.-Codemasters seem to have trouble mastering steering wheels. Even selecting the correct preset, the rotation of the ingame-wheel and the real wheel are not locked. You can fix this by limiting the range of your wheel, but it just gives me a bad first impression. Other games do this so much better, for example project CARS or assetto corsa.-The physics are hard to judge with that force feedback. But good luck trying not to lock up when you can't feel a thing. It's a guessing game. The only indicator for lockups is a high-pitched, very loud tyre squeal.+/-The graphics are ok. The screen on the wheel is generic, gives very little info, the textures of the driver gloves are muddy and generally it just doesn't scream ""beautiful"". But the graphics are good enough+The sound of the engine sounds goodAfter only 11 minutes of playing, the game doesn't fascinate me enough to continue playing. I am debating whether to get a refund.I do NOT recommend this game to wheel users at all			",46,3,10,3,12,0,3

												F1 Race Stars is a better Formula 1 game than this......I have been a fan of Codmasters F1 and Dirt series games since the first release. I preordered this game with the information that I read over the internet from reviewers and from the Codies website. I also used my previous experience with Codmasters F1 games as a basis on what type of quality to expect from a game like this one. I have previously purchased Dirt, Dirt 2, Dirt 3, F1 2010 thru 2014 from Steam and for the most part was happy with my purchase. I am also a fan of other racing titles that are more sim than game such as IRacing, Project cars. I have enjoyed playing Race 07, Asetto Corsa except the game server on Asetto Coursa is a joke. I spent many hours in Papyrus titles like GPL and their Nascar series , and also on Geoff Crammonds World Circuit thru his GP4. I have seen both the good and bad of all these titles at their best and worst. I did not set my expectations for F1 2015 any higher than what I had seen them previously release.Common sense would dictate that a company that has been making F1 games for the PC since their September release in 2010 would have a good handle on what it takes to get a game ready to market. Common sense need not apply here. It seems with the release of F1 2015 Codmasters has indeed returned to it's roots......console gaming. This title was written with that customer in mind, once again letting the PC customer know their business was unimportant to Codemasters.The control menus are a bad joke with the PC customer being the punchline. I was never able to get both my CSW V2 wheel and Richmotech real race gear pedals to work at the same time. It is a game that really does not have a target audience and does not know where to fit in. It is neither a Sim for hardcore enthuiasts or an arcade game strictly for fun. It lacks the features needed to entice the player into the simulated world of F1 Racing. This game is like a bad coat of paint aimed squarely at oblivion and doesn't really cover up all the problems underneath. With a shameful lack of content considering what was in previous releases, there is No fuunctional safety car, No  TV interviews, No career mode, No co-op mode, No Classic F1 cars,  No season challenge, No rival system, No champions mode, No SLI support, No split screen, No motorhome. No paddock and No TV interviews. The sheer scarcity of options and modes means this is yet another year where the ""Official F1 tie-in"" never even gets to the starting grid. The amount of modes left out of this title is borderline criminal and scandalous. It feels like less than half a game was released at a premium price no less. This title is far inferior to 2014, which was in turn inferior to the 2013 release. I don't believe most buyers will believe this is a ""less is more"" situation, but rather a trend to charge more and give less. They ""throw in"" the 2014 season as a bonus, because it's obvious they intend to BONE US with this title and the absense of so much of what should be seen as standard for F1. Codemasters really should kiss you before you buy this game, since it seems their intent is to just screw you, perhaps you would feel less used after. This publisher is so hell bent on hitting it's yearly release schedule that it pulled this one out of the oven half baked, and a easy bake oven they got a at a garage sale at that.I run a high end system and love to see titles push that hardware for what its worth. My current rig features  a core !7-5960, 64 gb ddr4, (2) Titan X video cards in SLI, 2 ASUS G-sync 27"" monitors at a res of  5890 x 1080 bezel corrected @144 hz. Aparently I would have had better results on a console system with this title. It crashed the first few times I ran a benchmark test so bad I needed to reload my video drivers and recalibrate the monitors as this game had them stuck in limbo after multiple crashes. This game crashes more than Maldonado and Grosjean combined. The graphics looked bad even when I got them to display, but they were constantly blinking and flashing, seemingly fishing for a proper state of display this catastrophy of a game could not deliver. It looked like it was snowing in Singapore and it nearly caused me to have suffer a seizure from the constant screen blinking. Because I never was ablle to get my wheel and pedals working at the same time, even though they worked fine in all their previous titles, I can not comment on the physics. The track textures have a filtery feeling that left me nausiated as well. This game is so awkwardly stylized it's more like a bad cartoon Anime, than a racing title.I would have to say that after a few hours of utter frustration spent trying to fix all the problems that run rampant with simple setup of this game, that the quit menu works great and that's about all. But even that suffers from problems as Steam then tries desperately to download some sort of non-existent update and finishes on an error 41. I suggest we all quit buying these type of half baked mess and let Codemasters know it no excuses as it is not their first rodeo, but could be their last. The best thing to do with this game is delete it permantly from your drive. There are plenty of good titles that offer proper racing that works to deal with this junk. Return it and get a refund while you can. Don't let them pull the wool over your eyes with idle promises to fix it....baaaahhhh bahhhhh.In a side note to STEAM, shame on you too. I have been a customer for over 8 years and have never even tried to return a title. I tried multiple times to get a refund on this as I was never able to complete even one lap, but was told that beacause I had more than 2 hours of trying to fix this worthless piece of junk, that they would not refund my money. Instead opting to join their co-conspirator Codmasters in ripping of a loyal customer for short term profit. Shame on you STEAM and Codmasters, I have purchased many of your products and recommended them to my friends, alas my policy is changed on that too. I will NEVER pre purchase a title again with this return policy. I had always believed that STEAM treated their customers fairly and with respect, but I see this was yet another lesson learned from this terible gaming experience.Your money would be much better spent on the 2012 or 2013 Codemasters F1 games than this abortion of a game. I would recommend Project Cars or IRacing to anyone looking for a Racing Sim.Had either of those titles offered all the cars or tracks from the current F1 season I would have never bothered with this lackluster castrophy in the first place. Save your money and buy something else.			",29,0,24,0,3,0,1

												I would have loved to score this a 10 as I've been supporting Codemasters series since its first go at F1. But this game does leave me with two main problems. Firstly the use of next gen graphics. Yeah eye candy is the word but at the expense of clarity. This leaves me with so much eye strain because of this constant sense of my eyes being out of focus. I'm left grabbing for a set of glasses I dont have. The use of soft treatment of solid outlines, blurred motion (you cannot turn off) and overall visual sense of lack of visual focus is painful at best. The second issue is that of control. The driving dynamics compared to F1 2014 for me is a step backward. I constantly feel like the car is doing what it pleases in a negative way. You dont get the feeling you are in control most of the time. The lack of setitng deadzones, sensitivity is a loss for me. For now this scores a 5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An honest review from a long-time Codies and F1 fan:Let me start by saying I don't play multiplayer often so this review has nothing to do with that section of the game.Having until now held back from purchasing this game due to the lack of career mode and the discussions of game-breaking bugs and crap AI, I can honestly say I was surprised at how not-broken this game really is. - Is it clearly a rushed job in terms of menus and extra content (i.e. challenge modes) from previous titles? Yes. - Is it a shame that there's only a 'championship season' mode rather than career? Yes, hugely!However, this game is NOT broken. Sure, there are some optimisation issues that mean that I can't run it on ultra, whereas my machine specs might otherwise have allowed it. But it looks very pretty on 'high' settings--far better than any F1 game has looked by far. Furthermore, since the modes are kind of bare-bones, the most important aspect of the entire game has to be the car mechanics and the racing. The mechanics themselves, while not perfect, feel really nice. This is NOT an arcade F1 game: with assists off you're fighting your back end out of the corners and trying to manage fuel/tyres in a way never before achieved in an F1 game. There's improvement to be made, but it's heading in a really great direction for F1 2016. For those really into the technical stuff, adjusting brake-bias and other settings are far more important now when it comes to preventing tyre lock-ups that now actually will destroy individual tyres. The AI is pretty dumb at times, admittedly. But it isn't game breaking (perhaps it was fixed over time).  But if you're like me and you were an F1 fan itching for F1 2016, hesitating to buy this one or having completely written it off, with the discount it's a really good buy. It is no longer a broken game as many reviews will tell you and it's actually a lot of fun. It's not the F1 2015 we were all hoping for, without career mode. But they focused on the racing, the feel of the cars, and they've done that really well. To tide you over until 2016 is released in August, I would definitely recommend this. More casual racing fans ought to stay away and wait until 2016 which will undoubtedly be better and more polished.Overall: 7/10 If it had career mode and some AI fixes it'd easily be a 9. As a result, buy it when on sale. ",114,10,19,26,9,0,20

												Another ♥♥♥♥ show from Codemasters, we can only hope this game doesn't sell and they go under so they cannot purchase the license again, since clearly the FIA don't care. - The game looks like you've had vaseline smeared on your monitor, there is no option to turn it off.- The 360 pad controls are just broken, weird things like neither X or B go back, they both confirm, even though it says B for back.- Crazy input lag on the controller, it feels like you have Vsync on (even though I don't), steering into the corner is so sluggish as a result.- Cannot change difficulty settings manually, you have to choose between presets, they're all grayed out as you load up and it only lets you change some assists. - The new online menu sucks- No coop online championship- No Safety Car- The damage seems non existant, I cannot even find the options to turn it on- No career mode- The character models look so creepy, they've also replace the driver portraits with them and it is disgusting.- The mirrors still look like crap, in fact the graphics don't look any better than before, half the graphical options are now missing.etc etc etc.Terrible.

												A crying shame of a product.Before I start, let me say I've by no means had the worst of this: the game runs fairly well for me, I've experienced far fewer crashes than some others, and I actually can maintain a just-about-playable 30-35 FPS (though with micro-stuttering).F1 2015 was touted as the start of the 'next series' of F1 games, with improved visuals and handling (both of which are, indeed, present).  However, it's fairly clear to see why there was very little media coverage of the game prior to launch: a huge swathe of features present in the 2010-2014 iterations of the title simply aren't there (no safety car, no brake options in setup, no career mode, etc.) and even some of the promised features don't function yet on PC (voice-activated race engineer, for example).  The omission of career mode doesn't really bother me greatly, though it was a nice feature, but removing the safety car in an F1 season where it's seen a significant amount of action, seems incredibly short-sighted.Add to this a game that crashes frequently; fails to remember options set in menus; has AI who drive like you're not even there (ramming you from behind or aggressively swerving into one of your rear tyres, usually resulting in a penalty for you); and displays a horrendous impermeable ""blur"" past about 200m in front of the car, that makes it almost impossible to see braking points and fine details in the distance... and you have a disappointing product.Many wondered how the system requirements for the game could be so high, in the face of a comparatively stripped-down F1 experience, and we have our answer: graphical optimisation seems almost non-existant.  The difference between ""everything on ultra"" and ""everything on low/off"" on my machine, represents a whopping 5 FPS difference (from ~30 FPS to ~35 FPS)... leaving us to assume there's a serious bottleneck occurring somewhere, that apparently wasn't worth finding before asking customers to hand over their hard-earned £40.Amongst all of this, however, it has to be said: the handling model has improved significantly in most of the major areas, and you do feel significantly less 'helpless' than in previous F1 titles by Codemasters (which infamously included the mind-bogglingly stupid ""auto-spin kerbs"").  I've been enjoying the driving experience, until the blur and micro-stuttering gives me a headache and I have to give it a break for an hour or two :)Not as bad of a screw-up as Arkham Knight, but certainly worthy of being mentioned in the same sentence - a spectacularly poor attempt from Codemasters and, if I hadn't purchased from a third-party, I'd be half way to my Steam refund by now.

												**I havent played previous F1 games so i will not compare this to older games**Pros:-Graphics/Visuals-Sound-Official 2015 tracks/teams-Handling of the Car-Loading times (really fast)-Cutscenes and CommentatorsCons:-Performance(its fine enough, but could be better)-Cannot be ""yourself"" in Championship-AI sometimes too agressiveOverall Great game. As a Linux user i don't have the older games so this one will do it. If you are F1 racing fan then this is a must get game. Hopefully F1 2016 will improve on that and will also come out to Linux.

												Managed to get to the grid for a quick race. No matter how gently I apply the throttle the rear wheels just spin, the car goes nowhere, and I get disqualified for stopping on track. The game then continues to a buggy flashing (every time, not just sometimes) outro vid of my driver at the end of the race or whatever. So I can't really review the gameplay as there isn't anyway. It's not therefore a game, just a bunch of broken code sat on my SSD.McLaren Honda are more reliable than this ""game"".			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After reading all the mostly negative reviews I still decided to give it a try as I wanted to see what the new eye candy would be given I have the Titan Z 12GB card.  Well sure, it's a bit prettier, but only a bit.  Unfortunaetly the good stops there.Fortunately they've fixed the separate USB controller issue so I could use my Thrustmaster TX wheel base and Fanatec Elite pedals.  Setting up the steering feel was nearly impossible.  It's rather difficult in all the Codeworks games but extra bad/hard here.  But the biggest problem by a mile and the reason I requsted a refund is the HORRIBLE sound.  Wow, it's just awful.  You hear nearly no engine and gearbox noise, it's like drivig down the highway where you hear nothing but wind.  I tried the various cameras and some were a touch better than others but only slightly.  I was rather surprised that it wasn't simple setting somwhere but nope, just awful.If you want to drive Formula cars on a PC get with F1 2013 or Project Cars (and run Formula A) stay far away from this mess.  First video game I've returned in my life.			",44,1,6,0,4,0,0

												An absolute mess of a game.  Weird bugs, incomprehensible force feedback, stupid online matchmaking and sync problems.  CM touts the ""TV Presentation"" of the game, but once you've seen it...you want it to go away.  The podium ceremonies are just the same cutscene each time with different skins.  I initially thought it was clever when Seb did ""the finger"".  When Lewis won the next race and did the exact same thing...my thoughts changed to ""how lame"".  The highly touted ""next-gen"" graphics, just make the game look like a muddled, blocky mess with a huge helping of motion blur (blur can only be turned off by editing an XML file).  I will say in 2015's defense though, they do seem to finally have gotten the AI drivers right, but better AI can't save this title.If you want an exciting drive...get Dirt Rally instead.  If you want a better sim?  Get Race07.BTW, this is the first game I've ever requested a refund on.  Sadly, was denied due to 4.6 hours of trying to find a way to get it to run acceptably (and sitting for 30mins in online lobbies).Until CM fixes this beast, I'm going back to 2013 (IMHO the best of the series).Avoid at all costs.

												I'm on poll at Monaco.  First corner, I feel a huge shunt in the back and I bounce off the barriers.  There's a massive accident behind me involving 16 AI cars.  There's no red flag.  There's no safety car.  There's no damage to my car.  The race continues for the four cars at the front.  A replay of the incident shows AI cars driving head-first into the crashed cars with no attempt to go around.  It's carnage.  I win the race.  I'm disappointed.That sums up F1 2015 for me.  Disappointment.  No patches in the world can fix this game before F1 2016 is released.+ Visuals are good+ AI better at overtaking- No safety car- No red flags- No career mode- No warm up lap- Poor damage model- Qualifying times buggy- Commentary is stale- Blue flagged cars don't move over and still fight for position- Just bugs, lots and lots of bugs			",54,15,7,2,11,0,3

												CAUTION: DUE TO THE STATE OF THIS GAME, THIS REVIEW IS SUBJECT TO CHANGEOkay, so Codemasters have really confused me with this one. Their F1 series, while generally good (2013 being their best effort, at least for me), has always lacked that little bit of magic to truly set it apart from previous, and quite frankly, better F1 games.F1 2015 had the opportunity to really set a new standard for the genre, with Codemasters finally taking the hint and using the power of next generation gaming platforms to build a newer, more modern engine.What followed is a product that has ultimately both satisfied and disappointed me for various reasons. Here we go.PROS- The handling model. Yes. Finally. I can't believe it. Codies have actually managed to produce cars which drive and feel great. And not in the ""easy"" sense of things. Turn the aids off, and you will struggle for traction, you will pump the brakes to keep them from locking, and you will need lightning reactions to correct over/understeer and avoid damaging your car and tyres. The feedback provided through the wheel is great, and you almost instantly know you've taken a corner well, even with your eyes shut. It truly is satisfying when you really nail a corner, let alone a whole lap.- The Presentation. One thing Codies Racing fans have been asking for since 2010 is a more TV-styled game, and this year they finally deliver. The often talked about Broadcast Presentation before and after races is great, with TV style camera angles and OSDs that come close to the FOM world feed. The commentary is awesome too, with lots and lots of varied lines, you don't really hear much of the same thing, and it just gels. It doesn't sound robotic and mis-matched like previous attempts at putting commentary in an F1 game. (I'm looking at YOU, Championship Edition.)And that's about it, I'm afraid. All that I really enjoy about this game. Those two points. I'm serious. Really.Here's a quick mish-mash of all the cons then:CONS- Codemasters giveth, and they doth taketh away. Want to race as yourself? Too bad. It's gone. Want to race with equal setups in Time Attack to truly find who is the best? Shame, that's gone too. Safety Car? Gone. Season Challenge? Gone. Scenario Mode...you get the idea.- The game doesn't seem to save my preferences and I find myself having to redo custom controls every I boot up.- Online Multiplayer. No. Just no.- Then there's the numerous bugs and glitches truly representative of an unfinished game. Just type in F1 2015 glitches/bugs in Youtube and you'll pretty much get what I mean.- Codies' amazing idea to pad out the game with 2014 content and hope no-one notices.It's a shame that, while Codemasters finally got something amazingly right in F1 2015, there are too many places where they just fall flat on their faces. I really don't know if I can review this as Recommended. I guess if the improved handling model is all you ever wanted, then it's great. Have a blast. However, if you were looking forward to a more comprehensive game with more appeal beyond just a World Championship Season, then just stick with F1 2013, it really is still the best.

												I pre-ordered this excited and waiting to play the new F1 game.  So far it was an absolute waste of money.  The game is trash.  The graphics are a bit fuzzy and the gameplay is brutal.  There are no extra game play modes as 2014 had.  The steering is way off from F1 2014 and even with full traction control the car slides still it's ridiculous.  Less content, more problems...

												First of all. I've just gotten my copy of  F1 2015 from my game store today. I've downloaded it, launched it, expecting it to be a good one. The menu looks great, navigation not bad. When i went into quick race, start the race, i'm stuck on the grid. I'm using a D-pad to play on PC. When i press on RT, the car just doesn't move. I HAD to manually go to the controls settings to change the controls one-by-one. AND when i press B ( Back ) , it takes it as A ( Selects ). Seems like D-Pad is screwed on this game. In Flashback option, pressing X means flashback. However, i press X, it's just back. AND i HAD to press A ( which is pause ) to flashback. Not sure what's going on here. The throttle and brakes seems screwed as well. Lastly, by moving the left stick, which means turning left or right, i moved it slightly and the steering wheel already shows fully. WOW. Nice one there. Turning at a corner with the joystick moved slightly, turns the car fully. Graphics wise, i have nothing to say about it. Can barely see the rear mirror. Totally blur. 35minutes into the game i think i already need glasses. IF i continue any further, i am going to have eye cancer. http://imgur.com/kA0BgHZ , http://imgur.com/Z7PMKnU  , http://imgur.com/EfiwBCR ",18,1,7,0,10,0,1

												tl;dr : Skip this one... It's not worth it. If you haven't go back and buy 2013 and get the 90s cars and tracks. Good content, fun racing, good driving model, good tracks. This game isn't living up to it's hype. If you do buy this NOT ON PC!Biggest let down ever. No more career mode. Don't even bother getting this on PC because you cant do races longer than 5 laps. Obviously you can select to but you'll run out of fuel. You can't talk to your engineer on the pc version, only on consoles. You need to talk to him to even know about your tires of your ♥♥♥♥ing fuel. The driving model while at first seemed better in the end was far worse. I wouldn't even turn the wheel (all assist off) and it would take me out of a corner from right to left. I was getting oversteer and should have been in the wall but the game actually without any assist corrected it for me. Later on it felt so twitched it just wasn't natural. Not to mention there's a major input delay that can't be turned off.On a positive note the AI are much better. They will actually pass you now and try to defend. They allow you to play the 2014 season with 2014 cars and driver lineup. Possitives just kinda end there.I want to say the tracks are good but I've found the tracks are mapped incorrectly as well. In montreal you just fly past the wall of champions and really don't even turn. How did they ♥♥♥♥ up a track that they had in their previous games?! Honesly...There's also no safety car... Yeah and no word on why yet.			",94,2,13,4,6,0,21

												It's not a bad game at all actually. I played all games since F1 2010 to date, so have some experience in ""Codemasters"" thoughts of semi-simulations.What is missing in F1 2015 game is just ""Carrer mode"" and maybe some challenges, as we had in previous releases.I'm not interested in multiplayer, because there's lack of players in racing games anyway, so I don't bother. Since you're in single player mode - you have quite a good challenge from improved AI.PRO Season mode is something that I was unable to compete in, since I have only XBOX controller. PRO Season mode - tough challenge, no aids, legend competition, no visual guides, so you must be prepared for it. Anyway, I'm not an expert in game reviews, but this game is not a bad game, as most of community claims.+ Graphics+ Physics+ Improved AI+ Challenging Steam achivements+ Incl. 2014 season- No Carrer mode- No single player challenges- Lack of players in multiplayer			",81,23,41,6,29,2,10

												Absolutely the worst F1 game made by codemasters and seriously the worst F1 game that I have ever played.Issues with usb devices : xbox controller causes FPS drop consistently in certain hardware configurations. No fix by CM.Horrible AI that ram into you. When people want aggressive AI, I don't think they were asking for ignorant psychopaths which drive into your rear end. Heck... F1 2013 had better AI which respected players/other drivers while being opportunistic. How they have actually reversed from making good/decent F1 games to terrible unplayable crap like this is beyond me. I have wasted $50 on this game. Can't return it/refund it.I have gotten F1 2010, 11, 12, 13 and 15. This will be the absolute last time I ever buy a CM product. Never again.			",79,4,7,4,4,0,3

												First i'll start with positive aspects of this game since there is not too much to say about this.Positives:-The new thing that I liked the most and you could only do it in the old F1 2006 is that you can spectate any racer from the pit during Practice/Qualifications. (Yes, with any pov and anyone)-I found all of the tracks better, in therm of graphics, if your specs are the one recommended or above then you will not have FPS drops playing at Ultra quality.-You can talk to your engineer while racing, it works with a mic, you can ask anything along the race, I did not expect this.-AI is more aggressive than previous games, and will try to overtake you in a corner or off the racing line. (Which causes crashes in most of the case, but it's still better than before.)That's all I found with the positives, now you'll understand why I rated this game that way.Negatives:-This game is unplayable with Keyboard , you need to have a Joystick otherwise you will just race off the track at every corner. So I took my Gamepad to try my best.-Gameplay changed too much, car handling is not perfect nothing near a real simulation. -AI is stupid (even more than previous games) and will drive into you, or will randomly ghost when you try to overtake them.-No more Safety car, no more Career Mode (I played only Career mode in their old games and I guess many did the same)-Collisions/Car damage is not realistic at all, as always we will need to wait until modders fix this, since CodeMasters will probably not.-The game gave me the worst corner cutting experience i've ever had. No jokes, even in F1 2006, 2010, 2013, 2014, it was more realistic when turning into corners. It just feels like the wheel does not turn but the car keeps turning like everything is fine.Well that's all I got to say, now if you're looking for an Arcade game then this is made for you, if you're looking for a true F1 experience (as they advertised) then you will be disappointed as Car handling even with all assists off is too unstable, no career mode and no safety car which is totally unrealistic.As they always do, they won't add anything until F1 2016 so they can get our money again just for 2-3 new features. That got me bored. Having new features that are cool but in the meantime they remove things that F*cks up the game.Next time i'll try it at a friend's house before giving away my money.

												Would not recommend this to any one its a broken mess of a game with more stuff taken out from previous games like career mode, career challenge mode also the proving ground . The 'new' so called pro season is just normal season mode with drivers on the hardest level and the assists taken off thats it.

												Pros:- The visuals and sounds of the car are really beautiful, a huge step up from 2014- Pitting is a lot realistic in release time and wheel changing- Car handling is very good with controller but would be nice if there was a tweak feature like project car doesCons:- Lack of co-op feature although I don't do co-op I love watching other people do races on YouTube so this is a huge let down- AI all over the place and bumping into your car even though you're driving in a straight line. They will try to overtake but really love to hit your rear wheels and make you spin off track or into a wall. (Had to do 5 laps with Maldonado and Grosjean on my rear and can't count the amount of times I had to use flashbacks to correct the crashes they made me do)- This motion blur effect when pitting is weird as when you turn into your pit station it looks like the game is lagging pretty badly.- Championship mode lacks features of customising how you want your race weekend to go. Some people have a lot of time while others don't and just want to get into the race. Speeding up the time is very slow and would be nice to add a feature that can increase the time in steps.All in all the game can be good but I wouldn't recommend buying the game till all the problems have been resolved. Also the lack of features in the game the price should be no more than £20. Luckily I got mine for £27.99 on Amazon prime so I did save quite a bit than paying £39.99 but still I feel I paid more than what I should have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I hope Codemaster's will update and patch this with graphics issue.  Been playing F1 2012 & 2013 by far the best F1 I've played. I pre-order F1 2015 because of its new mechanics and game engine. However, when i started playing it all at Ultra High plus SMAA +TAA, 16x. It is a lil bit blurry i had to go to its folders and disable motion blur. Got it on XBOX One and i must say it was better than the Steam Version :(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												if there was a game that should be pulled from steam this one would be it.so called supported wheels dont work properly , and the general lack off configuration options is bull.Blurry graphics , even though you can disable motion blur un the XMLForce feedback..... what force feedback?Randomly losing the ability to steer because of using the car info button or the voice controll button ( have to do 90 degree left right left at 300+ while braking for a corner = BS )Lack of features ... just read some other reviews   you get the point..Every time you start up the game you have to redo your controlls ( G27 )Ai ,  when you do 340+ after eau rouge and the ai cars just ram up your ♥♥♥ with what i think is about 400 kmh    just bsThere is much more wrong to list but its getting me mad already writing this stuff so i stop here....AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE  IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THIS WITH A WHEEL AND EXPECT SIMCADEThe most ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console port codies has done in recent years !!!!

												1. There is horrible microstutter which makes the game look jittery and choppy even when locked at 60 frames per second. Without vsync my system pushes around 90fps on the High preset - it still doesn't look smooth at all.2. The graphics are insanely blurry.3. Fanatec Clubsport V2 pedals are not properly supported, there is a massive unadjustable deadzone that means only a tiny amount of the brake pedal's movement actually has any effect in game. It is virtually impossible to brake like this, tapping the brakes doesn't work because the game doesn't detect anything while braking hard is an instant lock up because the range detected in game is so small I can basically only brake 100% or not at all. (It is not my pedals, they work fine in every other game including previous F1 games and there are reports of other people with the exact same issue).4. The game crashes every time on exit.5. Loading times are outrageously long.6. Why are the AA options so limited? TAA is atrocious and SMAA doesn't do much for the jaggies.I can't comment on the AI because I haven't raced against them seeing as the lack of support for my pedals makes the game unplayable.

												Wow, this is just another simple ported game. Has a high toy factor. :(I could not even simply drive and go. Setup is only accessible during a session.There was no setup menu in the first screen. Had to do the graphics setup through GForce Experience. Looked good afterwards.All controls look like a ported game. It is in fact just a simple port from the XB1 version.No feel in the wheel; FFB is not working out of the box. The wheel input is not direct enough for an F1 game.No good working presets for my Fanatec wheel. It was recognized but could only turn left.Even after creating a custom setup it feels like playing with a controller and not a wheel.It feels unconnected and vague.Obviously optimized for controller use.I wanted to do a few laps on the Hungaro ring for the upcoming F1 weekend in Hungary, but could not even drive normally.Used the ""Elite"" setting with all driving aids off. But even than it feels unconnected and unresponsive.For the more serious players this game is not a good choice. I can not recommend it. Too bad as i was looking forward to this game. Maybe the F1 license should go to SMS or another more serious Development Studio. Nice game for the wannabe F1 driver kiddos, but nothing serious. Even with the 50% discount a waste of money for me.6/10 score. Disappointing.			",205,88,45,33,66,5,72

												It pains me to write this, but don't buy this game. As a massive F1 fan I want so badly for these games to be good but they're just getting worse. No career mode is an absolute joke, it's like going back to the F1 97 days of just having a championship mode, except that was a great game. The driving itself feels pretty good and I like the options you have in terms of communicating with the team while driving, but the graphics just look a bit strange to me, like a bit too glossy I think. Also the damage is absolutely awful. I T-boned Ricciardo at a hairpin to test it out and was left without a front wing but zero other damage!!! I was under the impression that F1 2014 was poor so that the team could focus on 2015, and now I read that they weren't happy with the career mode so will probably leave it until 2016, but why should I believe them? So disappointing...			",99,25,8,17,13,0,11

												I have to say I agree with the negative comments here, first time I started the game...it crashed. I tried again after a reboot and it took an age to load (I have an i7 by the way so not a slow machine). Unlike Project cars F1 2015 didn't automatically detect my Logitech G27 wheel , not a big issue but just had to go to settings and select it.The the game starts and man, its blurry! the car feels like its on ice, all over the place, the handling is no where near as good as Project Cars. I'm very disappointed. I'm a big fan of F1 and was looking forward to this, I hope they fix it urgently but the game shouldn't have been released in this state, its not finished by the looks of it!bring back geoff crammond!

												Honestly, the game is a challenge to get used to - I'm not disputing that at all. It's good to have a challenge. However, there are too many other problems with the game that are just too big to ignore. Predominantely:- Graphics: While they are good, Codies have gone from looks over actual gameplay and functionality.- Multiplayer: is absolutely woeful. It's impossible to race against anyone effectively when the game can't keep up with who is where on the track. All of a sudden, you get told you're in first, and before you even cross the line, someone else has crossed it and pops up a fastest lap.- Push to Talk: Why was this stripped out of the game? I don't want to voice everyone in the game if I'm speaking to someone privately in a TS Server.- Glitches: ie: refer my posted screen shot - how the hell can a car drive around on rims!?!?!? This isn't the only one.- Gameplay assists: There's absolutely NO difference between Traction Control being off and on Medium. There was at least some difference on 2014.- Steam Achievements and Trading Cards: Despite doing at least 10 clean laps around Russia in a Marrusia in Time Trial, the game fails to recognise these laps towards the achievement - I don't know why. The game also claims to have Steam Trading cards - I'm yet to see any after nearly 4 hours of play, and a friend has 10 times as many hours (40) and hasn't seen any either. So the Trading Cards are a blatant lie at this stage.Codies - if you bothered to look at the Meta Scores in Steam for your games since 2010, they have been steadilly declining, with 2014 being the worst of the last 5. Your track record suggests that this one will be the worst of the lot. If you can't get your ♥♥♥♥ together, you don't deserve a renewal to make more of these games from FOM.There's just one question remaining: Did anyone at Codemasters even bother to test this game PROPERLY before it was released?**EDIT: SInce my review, allegedly, trading cards have been released. **			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't reccomend the game in it's current state as it doesn't support controllers properly.I first tried using a DualShcok 4 through DS4Windows, but that made the camera flick erratically between different angles constantly, making the game unplayable.I then switched to a Logitech F510 (an offically-supported PC gamepad), and the game doesn't work properly with that either. In DirectInput mode, the game thinks the X button is the B button, the A button is the B button and so on. It also locks the brakes on as soon as you start a session, so again unplayable.I tried the pad in the archaic XInput mode, and while the game does seem to recognise it as a gamepad, the R2 and L2 buttons in XInput mode work like switches rather than triggers, so you're throttle and brakes are either 0% on or 100% on, with no middle ground. This also makes the cars completely undriveable, and the game unplayable.There's absolutely NO excuse for selling a game with such fundamental playing errors. At the moment, you can't even call it a game, because you can't play it AT ALL. I don't know if CodeMasters have left the PC port 'til the last minute, or don't think that controller support is necessary for their games, or if they were forced to release the game in such a state to satisfy contractual demands with the Formula 1 licensing body, but whatever the reason, they've royally screwed over their fans and their customers.I cannot reccomend this game to anyone.

Why they cant produce a good game that has a decent amount of content after 5 years of making f1 games is dissapointing and this version seems to have less content than the first game.

												In car camera, in wet conditions, the rain droplets on the car are moving differently to the car movement, it looks really ugly and spoils the expereince.There seems to be a wierd graphical effect like chromatic aberration which looks stupid and can't be turned off.Side mirrors rear view of scenery and cars are chugging like at 10 fps where as normal forward view graphics are running at normal speeds.I must say though, the graphics themselves are not next gen at all, very pastelly and dull, instead of vibrant and normal looking, i hope they can patch this, a damn shame.Using a T300 Wheel, each time i load up, i have to re select the T300 wheel in the controller settings as it seems to default back to keyboard/mouse.I have to change the rotation speed of the T300 to 360 in the Thrustmaster control panel from windows desktop, i thought codemsters programmed it to work straight away?Running an unlooped benchmark, it crashes back to the desktop every time.

												Seriosuly, Codemasters couldn't be bothered to support a Thrustmaster GTX controller? It's kind of shocking since there is that whole Codemasters-Thrustmaster partnership thing and they support EIGHTEEN other Thrustmaster products. That is litteraly half of the PC enable devices listed on the Codemaster website, so it's not like this is some weird no-name 3rd party controller that no one knows about. Hell, I bought this controller specifically because it was the best rated controller for racing style games and I can't really afford to shell out an extra $300 on a wheel and pedal setup as nice as that would be. Even after going into the settings menu I couldn't even create a custom profile and bind the controller buttons, even though it seemed like the option to do so was there. I can't really discuss the gameplay because I couldn't actually get to play the game at all. I am hugely dissapointed that Codemasters couldn't be bothered to add in suppoort for what is basically a standard 360 gamepad. Oh, the graphics of the cars are ok but everything else (track, stands, etc.) looks like it was assembled out of 2005's leftovers. Two thumbs way, way down.			",157,23,30,29,14,1,22

												Jumped into the game and started to set up my graphics. Crashed immediately. Good start.Started a season as Max Verstappen, went through practice fine at 60fps smooth as you like. All going well and feeling I had the new physics (which are pretty good) figured out I jumped into quali. 5fps.

												Well is this it? Sorry but so far project cars beats this, the graffics are better in some ways this time round but seem a little blurry , using csr wheel force feedback is poor , the game doesnt really give me any thrill to be driving like a few race sims out there i was really looking forward to this, really feel let down with all the hype. Hope they can fix some of the issues then i will reveiw it again.What needs to be fixed.Graffic issues, damage on cars! , force feedback ,  at the moment 6/10  Ireally would like to recomend this game, but in this state i cant , please codemasters fix the issues.

												they dont support the Fanatec CSR wheel. Also they dont support Fanatec Clubsport V2 pedals. The game is unplayable. They need a steering wheel profiler like Assetto Corsa and iRacing. Yeah, like all the reputable and popular racing sims.Real shame as I was really looking forward to this title.Before I came to PC I was on console playing on xbox 360, F1 2014. It worked like a dream but PC on the otherhand. . .Iam actually glad this happened yes, $50 down the drain but on the bright-side I wont spend another cent on a codemasters f1 game and back to the F1 mod in Assetto Corsa for me.

												Can't seem to go more than 5 laps without it going wrong. Running smooth at 40-50fps, then out of nowhere drops to 5fps and I am forced to quit the race as it doesn't recify itself. Melbourne is a complete no go for me. Most I can get is 5fps no matter what my graphics settings are. So that renders Championship and Pro season modes useless to me. When it works I think its great but for the amount of laps I can do, this was definatly not worth it.			",41,3,17,4,15,0,4

												For ♥♥♥♥'s sake Codemasters I knew there was a high posibility of not delivering much inovation to the series, but you seriously gave the gamers a ♥♥♥♥ing downgraded game! I mean how more could you ♥♥♥♥ this up? I think you can't be more dissapointed since your expectations are so low. How on earth can you give your customers a product such as F1 2015? And I am not even mentioning the bugs that come with the game (which luckily did not occure to me)!Since I started with a negatively very bad introduction I'll try to talk about the pros. First of all the number one thing I was desprately waiting for was the inprovment of the AI cars. This year i could finally say the AI  cars are a challenge and gives the game a tromendous amount of depth which makes the races attractive in so many levels compared to the previous F1 games from Codies, but it took them 5 years to improve such a basic gameplay tool that should be a priority in every racing game! And ladies and gentlemen that's about it when it comes to gameplay improvment.There is also an improvment in the graphics and it's nice to see a visual difference in F1 2015 and previous F1 games. I could insist it looks next gen, but isn't mind blowing. Now the cons: It seemed to me that the developers were mostly interested in the graphic upgrade like better looking environments, faces and the engineers ,which is completely pointless since all of the character models are acting the same just like in other pre-race start. It definitely does not make my Formula 1 experience more authentic regardlessly on how much the graphics are in depth of detail. If I get to see the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over again it just gets annoying (same thing about the comentary). I'd rather just have a simple menu were I could use my imagination instead of forcing my self to enjoy something  I'm used to see a lot of amount of times. Some drivers do look pretty neat and some do look literally disgusting like for example Maldonado.The worst thing about this game is the missing content. At first I was amazed by it, but after trying to play a different single player mode instead of just playing quick race, champions mode or time trail I started to realize there is nothing really else to do in this game, but wait you say there is multiplayer? Well i say multiplayer is pure ♥♥♥♥. I spent a week playing this game and I could not even once find a multiplayer session. Codemasters won't let you even create an open lobby session, You can only play with your freinds, but if you wanna race with the rest of the world you can use their ""innovative"" multiplayer modes which don't have a single player in it!And the last thing I would like to mention is one of the important aspect of the game that has a big part on how the game runs is the LACK OF SAFETY CAR. I have simply no words for not including such an important game feature that was in the previous games. You say it will be patched sooner or later? That makes it look like that the game is still in early access alpha god damn it!When it comes to gameplay features this game is definety fun, but this innovative feature of the game cannot save it from the overall lack of content.6/10			",18,3,2,2,3,0,2

												Why i feel ripped off.1. This game is poorly optimised and will have fps issues even on really good pcs. 2. This game crashes - a lot! In games with 1 lap to go it can crash on you, and often it crashes on startup.3. Stearing does not feel as smooth as in 2013. - there is some latency on controllers! watch out.4. Game doesn't feel finished at all. I feel like im playing an alpha version of the game - i played 40 euro for this!!5. Its really hard to find multiplayer games.Pros.1. Graphics look good - on the right setup2. Better AI's3. Awesome music!EDIT:After 20 hours of gameplay i decided to play the game with a steering wheel, and oh my, --- its a completely different experience. Recommended IF you are using steering wheel with force feedback.If you are using a controller or have an old pc, buy f1 2013			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolute Garbage.I have watched and loved f1 since 1994 and played the games since 1995.  F1 97 is still more enjoyable than this effort from these money grabbing goons.  Hang your heads in shame, Codemasters!The PC version should look absolutely stunning now that the consoles versions are ""next gen"" but somehow it looks worse than last year in some areas.  The handling is quite nice once you get a feel for it but the braking is very unpredictable and you can't trail brake like you would in PCars/Corsa/Iracing etc.There seems to be a new glitch every 30s.  If you use a flashback from terminal damage the game will continue to run in black and white once you have continued.  You seem to get constantly kicked from online lobbys just as the race is about to begin.  Online there is a gearbox bug that means you are always in the limiter no matter what gear you  use.  As with previous games you need to use vsync for your wheel to work properly.  If you decide to restart a race it will put you in neutral.  To top it all off you will constantly be kicked back to your desktop. Well done.			",5,0,6,0,0,0,0

												EDIT :31rd December 2016. Dont get this piece of ♥♥♥♥.. just dont. Even the controls are still ♥♥♥♥ed. Back in the days, you could at least manually assign controls so it'd work, but now, controller, or KB, doest matter. will just get stuck on full throttle. cant change ♥♥♥♥ in options. Just dont get it. Maybe if its 1€ but other than that,dont trust it to actually work.What can i say, the game is great, but lacking in so many ways, and i wish steam had a Neutral rating aswell.First off lets start with the positives.The handling model really seems to be upgraded, and i really enjoy the racing. way more than before!AI is okay, more agressive than before, and faster!Pro mode is a good concept. (More on that later though.)Driving in rain is fairly good looking with offset TVPod. And actually in general.The engineer stuff is pretty immersive, and he will update you aswell with info etc.Tyre wear seems great so far and you can really feel your grip go, and feel if you are hard on them or not.Game seems to run well, and stable maxed out. 4690k / 970.Negatives.Stripped features, that were in previous games like :No Scenario mode.No Co-Op season.No career mode.Full qualifying but 50% race? nope.It feels bareboned at best sadly.Raindrops on your screen is worse than f1 2014. Very blurry, can barely tell its supposed to be drops.Lackluster settings, like chromatic abberation and blur having to be manually killed off in the config.Come on codemasters, Windows 8 has voice recognition aswell, you COULD have added that feature for PC aswell.Pro mode is manual gears only, and i feel that isn't really okay. We should still have the option of manual/auto.Tire models seem almost too clean? Grass to rubber transition is instant instead of wearing off slowly etc.Multiplayer not finding any games for me /will be edited out when it does.Multiplay lobbies are friends only , right now it seems.Game is beautiful, but doesn't look like the next gen stuff from the trailers.If they are going to add Podium cutscenes, at least pull them off right, the funny music is extremely anti climactic, and no champagne spraying etc.Drivers hugging /Arm around the shoulders... LOL.FFB.I'm very sad, because i really wanted to give it a good review, but as of right now, it's not going to get one, Next gen game with stripped/missing features, that's not cool codies.

												Poor release code with so many issues, no updates have fixed any of the performance problems most people are having. Lucky to get 5 FPS when loading into the game,. Sometimes runs ok, mostly not though - 2 steps forward 1 step back Save your money from Project cars or any other decent sim,Update = 1/8/15m_stone01 Just now  hopeless game, even after 2 updates and a gew weeks to fix the random FPS issues still have the same problems time after time.

												UPDATEThe new patch that has been released today (August 20th, 2015) has fixed the multiplayer issue I had. In addition to fixing the multiplayer, it resolved a lot of in game issues that were listed in the update notes. Keep up the work Codemasters, this game is getting pretty good!Although the game has a low score, I wouldn't say it is that bad.PROS:Good driving physicsAI is actually aggressive enough to try overtakesGood graphicsRuns quite well on my rigPro season modeCONS:[Fixed in the latest patch] Multiplayer seems to be broken, or have no players (For me at least)[Fixed in the latest patch] Graphical glitches (The one I always get is the one where rear left tire keeps phasing in and out.)Penalty system that keeps penalizing me for contacts and collisions I didn't do.No safety car (Like, wtf? Why?)No career mode where YOU are the driver, instead you got to pick a driver from this season to play as.Overall, not a horrible game, just not quite finished in my opinion. Give this game a try once the price drops, or once some time passes so all the issues get worked out.			",138,9,15,12,20,3,27

												EDIT :31rd December 2016. Dont get this piece of ♥♥♥♥.. just dont. Even the controls are still ♥♥♥♥ed. Back in the days, you could at least manually assign controls so it'd work, but now, controller, or KB, doest matter. will just get stuck on full throttle. cant change ♥♥♥♥ in options. Just dont get it. Maybe if its 1€ but other than that,dont trust it to actually work.What can i say, the game is great, but lacking in so many ways, and i wish steam had a Neutral rating aswell.First off lets start with the positives.The handling model really seems to be upgraded, and i really enjoy the racing. way more than before!AI is okay, more agressive than before, and faster!Pro mode is a good concept. (More on that later though.)Driving in rain is fairly good looking with offset TVPod. And actually in general.The engineer stuff is pretty immersive, and he will update you aswell with info etc.Tyre wear seems great so far and you can really feel your grip go, and feel if you are hard on them or not.Game seems to run well, and stable maxed out. 4690k / 970.Negatives.Stripped features, that were in previous games like :No Scenario mode.No Co-Op season.No career mode.Full qualifying but 50% race? nope.It feels bareboned at best sadly.Raindrops on your screen is worse than f1 2014. Very blurry, can barely tell its supposed to be drops.Lackluster settings, like chromatic abberation and blur having to be manually killed off in the config.Come on codemasters, Windows 8 has voice recognition aswell, you COULD have added that feature for PC aswell.Pro mode is manual gears only, and i feel that isn't really okay. We should still have the option of manual/auto.Tire models seem almost too clean? Grass to rubber transition is instant instead of wearing off slowly etc.Multiplayer not finding any games for me /will be edited out when it does.Multiplay lobbies are friends only , right now it seems.Game is beautiful, but doesn't look like the next gen stuff from the trailers.If they are going to add Podium cutscenes, at least pull them off right, the funny music is extremely anti climactic, and no champagne spraying etc.Drivers hugging /Arm around the shoulders... LOL.FFB.I'm very sad, because i really wanted to give it a good review, but as of right now, it's not going to get one, Next gen game with stripped/missing features, that's not cool codies. Not cool at all! Let me guess, it's coming with DLC? I don't want to even think that, but it does smell like it in all honesty.

												Wow, and not in a good way.  I made the mistake of playing a lot of MODERN racing games, like Asseto Corsa and Pcars, and somehow thought that the most recent F1 game would have the expected quality of a game made in this decade.  I was wrong.This is nothing more than yet another terrible console port with non-existant physics, poor graphics, very limited ability to interact (can't even look around using a mouse or anything, stuck with one view of right and left, no up or down, etc).  What garbage compared to the other current and far, far superior offerings on the market.What an absolute WASTE of the F1 rights to formula one games.  Its just wasted on a company that year after year puts out low effort, low quality garbage.  Good thing that there is enough on the market now that I don't have to put up with garbage.  I will NEVER buy another official F1 game so long as this company continues to hold the rights.  No more money from me, and thank goodness Steam allows refunds.  Don't waste your time, get a real racing game instead.			",13,6,5,0,2,1,1

I can't quite place it but it doesn't look anywhere near as sharp as I expected. Seems somewhat washed out as well.Force feedback feels pretty lame compared to other games.While I was really looking forward to a open wheel game with branded teams and drivers I think I'll get my racing fix elsewhere for now.

												ABSOLUTE PANTS, im really fed up of getting excited for a few months in anticipation of the next f1 incarnation, believing they will fix it this time. This happens every year and every year its dissapointing but this years effort is a complete let down. Amongst all the bugs and crashes the menus seem awkward to navigate, the graphics with everything set to full provide a good frame rate but the actual quality is worse than last year. These people should be hung drawn and quatered for releasing such rubbish, 164 reviews and only 2 people have given it a thumbs up. I unfortuanately orderd this pre order fromm game with the promise of a metal tin and race handbook, unfortuanately neither came and i cant get a refund, shame the tin didnt come i could have buried it the churchyard which is all this title deserves. I would like to call apon the UK population..if you have had enough of them ripping you off year in year out with unfinished sub standard software lets all get together and form a Mass protest outside of there headquarters, MAYBE THEN THEY WILL THINK TWICE ABOUT RELEASING SUCH AWEFULL RUBBISH.

												Weekend Free to Play Tester.I didin't spend really much time on this game , as i have tryed it only on the Free to Play Weekend at 18th Marth. I would not give this game a Bad rate like it's mostly got from other peoples for probably stupid reason because they play it on a potato , the game is definatelly not a trash , it's really makes much funn to race it because its easy to handle it , i don't had any problems with it , no bug's at all , the graphic is ""Blury""  but precise and great and like we known from codemasters great optimized , doing a Long Race Event  without to have even one Lag @ Maxed out settings , brings a huge + to F1 2015I didn't had time to try the multiplayer ( there is a reason why i didint even try to get time for it ) , but doing some long custom race's , time atacks with lot's of laps and finished one Championship Season on Hard Difficult , and i have to say , that i have enjoyed every round. The AI is something that i was most positive suprised , they are not those that rams you of the road , but they do mistakes to , missing corners if taking to much Risk , Crashing , go of Track geting penalties , also you can see that they fight for a place like you do too , but still staying as an Clean Drivers.I used an Xbox 360 Gamepad to play it , and only in a fev minutes i already found my perfect setting to be available to play on my ideal line's ( of course without spending much time on car settup ) and was ready to go.The only problem had so far with this game is , that F1 2015 is a little to far away from a SIM Feeling , also to me , this is one of the most Arcade F1 Game i played so far. ( I played them all but not F1 2014 ) and second one was that every time i run the game before i race i have to select manualy my Gamepad Custom Setting that ive done , for some reason it will not select it by it self when i have setup everything ""not a big deal , it takes 2 seconds"".AIO  = I recommended this game if you catch it at some low Price , but for an aracade racing game i never would spend that Full Price.Again to notice: Weekend Free to Play TesterIf i Could , i would go for this deal that is available right now: - 60% = 19,99€ ( Aceptable )			",186,32,29,16,14,1,10

												Wow, thats all I can say. What a mix of emotions from this game. I'll start from the start, but before I do, Im not going to mention any sort of bugs or anything like that, just the game itself.Negatives: - I really enjoyed having my own career so not being able to play as myself only as a current racer really really sucks for me and is probably for me the most disappointing thing so far.- The second thing that really annoys me is the fact you cant edit the race distance which sucks. There's 3 settings of race distance and you cant edit that at all.- I enjoyed the Young Drivers Test in the 2013 game and thought it added a lot to it as a real career. In this game the first time you get to drive in career mode is the first practice session. To live the full experience of F1, there should be young drivers test and pre Season testing to learn to drive the car and even set up tips etc.I havent played a lot of the game yet but these are just some things I feel.Now positive:- I like the 2014-15 change over, not sure if it does, but I hope you can start the career in 2014 then at the end of the year it goes to 2015.- The new look start up menu looks good, and the start of each session with Crofty (As much as I dont like him or his voice) is pretty cool i suppose.- The new interactions with the drivers and engineers like the setup with the tablet, the pop up menu in the race, etc and the new setup options aswell.This is all I have so far but I will start playing a bit more and see how it goes.

												So I previously had a review for this game which was quite negative. Now some time has passed since the initial realese and some additional hours have been added to the playtime. So lets revamp this on how I feel about this game at this state;A lot of talk was about the game crashing which I previously didn't have any trouble with. However, I had stated that the game loaded very slowly which I can happily say no longer seems to be a case.I'd spoke a little about the graphics, I still don't truely belive there is any difference graphically compared to the other games. It has improved, there are lower flickers and edges, but there are still some common graphical issues that do occur! The game options have now been updated and finally do stick when you've selected them, so no more fiddle faddeling just to set up a game. The sound is still fundamentally broken! It's a trait through every game I guess...The AI overall is a lot more challanging, though they do really still make very rookie moves and they have a tendancy to get in front of you and just brake and pull you off the track, causing your race to be ruined :/ sigh...The controller is still very much broken, a lot of improvements but still it's not where it should be, not even with custom settings. Car is very difficult to steer on steering lock, I could actually go as far as saying keyboard is better for a full lock turn... now that is shocking.Muliplayer? There practically is none. The hoppers are rubbish and custom matches you'll be lucky to find two or maybe three lobby. Likely when you get into that lobby and start a race, you'll find yourself getting passed by cars because you get ghosted (some weird glitch under braking) or if not that getting thrown into a gravel trap from some freaky alien glitch spinning you several times on the spot then leaping you out into that gravel l o l .. Penalty system.. well, should I say more.. However the timings and connection does seem much more stable, not really a pro though when you consider the other glitches. Overall it would be an OK game to buy, for £10 or less (if you didn't own any other versions) Though I would probably recommend you to get 2013. Paying anything more though is just asking for dissapointment. I don't think I can recommend this game still at this time though because I just don't truely believe that it's a finished product. Updates come out rarely and when they do they're not resolving real time issues.Though that doesn't mean it can't change my mind in the future.Sort your ♥♥♥♥ out Codematers, and finish this damn game!

												I will be conciseThe game. Is. Hm glitchy :3Ok now seriously The positives: - New handling model, on the first try i utterly hated it but now i got used to it and realised the game has the most realistic handling model i have ever tried (haven't played sim games tho to compare). - Improved sounds, it reminds me more of the cars i hear on real f1, unlike f1 2014 where ferrari had completely different engine sounds, and zero physic sounds. Now they all come to play.- I would say slightly improved graphics, tho i was awaiting for more, it's just seems an up-resed version with better reflections and lighting system. But i will also put the negatives about the graphics here, as i said there isn't much improvement on colours etc. It seems the same engine to me. The lighting on some places is utterly bad, i mean how are the legs of the drivers able to be so bright? they are under the car, they should be shadowed, and i wonder how i am the only one so far who talks about it. The shadows on some cars especially under the mirrors or above the wheel, are only pixels bigger than my fingers, and generally they could have done a much better job with graphics.- The commentary pre and after race, in addition to the grid showcase put some life realism into the game, but for some point after, the commentary isn't something special, it get's boring. Now the negatives: I actually have no idea from where to start about. I might say the same things as other guys said thought i only read a few reviews, because i bet most of the problems are problems that we all have- No career mode. No need to discuss that further.- No safety car. No need to discuss that too.- Single player glitches. For instance those only a few i found since day one: Pit stop glitch   Time Trial Glitch   Not to mention many others like top speed failures some times, being on mercs with drs and sleepstream and the mclaren gets away, or AI crashing like hell sometimes. Anyway- They removed the old system lobby, to be able to search for an exact custom race and find it. Now it's almost impossible for example if a big youtuber hosts a lobby, they is no way people can join, unless the hosts invite them. Unbeleavable.- Even with the removed old system lobby, we hoped we could do some racing on the standard types of races the game offers. No way this could have happened. Even u can't join a lobby, if you can, there might be a race winner since lights go out, if it doesn't people will dc or get dsq on pit stops, or people might be driving on the same lobby, different circuits and the same times. WTF IS THIS. Multiplayer=UNPLAYABLE-Enough. I already got tired i have no more energy to think of other negatives xD IN CONCLUSION:  I think the game has a lot  of potential with the new handling etc. Codies just fcked it up with the features and glitches. About the glitches, there is a high posibility they gonna fix them soon via patch. About the features, I HAVE NO CLUE what they were thinking when they said ""oh let's remove career mode it will make the game better"" or ""let's change the lobbies style, now people are forced to wait to play on a random lobby instead of joining through a list of available hosts"".The game is restrictive and bad at the momment, but at least I, as a massive F1 fan, i enjoy playing single player a little bit, challenging on time trial etc. So I should not recomment this game, and that's what i do, thought it has new handling model, slightly improved graphics in general, and the potential of being a good game after they sort of the glitches.P.S:  SHOCKING interview with Codemasters engineer about this game   :P			",2,0,3,0,0,0,0

												I can't even start the game with my G25 plugged in. If I plug it while playing, the game will CTD.*edit* 8/4/2015Ok, now at least I can START the game with the wheel plugged in, but as soon as I can control the car the game freezes and...yeah...CTD. *windowed and full screen*Lots of issues have been looked into, which is fine. At least they are trying, I guess.FPS issues still there though. I skipped the whole 'welcome to Australia...' video and right into the box lag was insane. *windowed mode* Skipped intro in full screen and no lag. Also didn't skip and no lag. Tried only once each.*edit* 8/7/2015Ok, I have just installed Windows 10. Deleted everything I had in all my hdds. Now F1 2015 works!It has improved a lot from 2013 (didn't try 2014) Handling now aims towards realism. Only did a full race weekend in Australia so far, so I need to test it further.-CONSNo safety car!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Random penalties.AI will hit you if you are off the pace in the racing line. No effort whatsoever to move or brake.Some glitches around:     Smoke coming out of a car (no, it wasn't a blown engine)     Sometimes, when you open the game and start a race, your wheel might get deadzones even though deadzones are zeroed.I will still not recommend this game until problems are sorted out, too many people still can't play.

												Rubbish. This is my first steam review as I normally don't bother writing them, but I couldn't let this slide .. the game is terrible. I've come across four bugs in under an hour. First, the keyboard doesn't work for navigating the menus so you can't change default controls (I googled and eventually found if you disconnect all of your controllers you can eventually get it to work), then the left rear wheel just constantly flickers. Then for some reason when I pressed the accelerator the wheels animated and eventually started smoking but the car didn't move at all on track (not a traction control problem, another bug). Then the cinematic cut scenes are garbled too. Another possible bug (not included in the four above) is getting errors when the game tries to communicate with the steam servers (something I've never experienced with any other game). I've played the previous games in the series and quite enjoyed them. If you want a decent racing game at the minute I suggest assetto corsa. Codemasters should be embarrassed. Getting a refund.

												I'm DONE codes and so should everyone else that has stuck by you for the last few years of me·di·oc·ri·ty.At this time there is NO MOD suport (codes went out of their way to make it harder to tweak their new ERB files), which means:-Your stuck with GARBAGE sound-Okay to Bad FFB-no way to make AI faster-No way for someone to make a F1 2016 fantasy season / or anything Fantasy at all / that means NO cars, helmets, pit -crew, etc.-no up to date track updates like signsWarning RANT in: 3,2,1For the most part Codes people have tolerated your BS becuase you've got a stranglehold on F1 and you've looked the other way in reagards to MODS, but with your NEW, but NOT NEW, game engine (game looks better and worse on PC then your other titles) you went and FU@$ your players. I can understand codes baby, I can, it hurts the pride when moders make your game better then you can, but to go out of the way to make it MOD UNFRIENDLY is just crazy stupid. First things first, audio is trash, I know the new v6 engines don't sound as great as last gen cars, but they don't sound this bad, Its F1 not lawnmower man. Do the f1 teams not let you near their cars codes, why can't you get a proper sound recording of the engines (moders can).Why can I not change my viewing angle? ACorsa, Pcars, Iracing, etc all let me, so why then Codes dont you. There is this little something sim racers like to do and thats GETTING A PROPER FOV based on screen size and viewing distance you FU@$ ♥♥♥♥♥. (MODers let me)So you got Anthony Davidson, who does a bit of the simulation stuff for Mercedes, as your handling consultant and In terms of detailed feedback, it's Anthony first and foremost. So I've never driven an F1 car, but if this was going to be a SIM like you said over and over should the wheel have high speed vibrations? (yes), snap over or understeer?(yes). I've played the f1 mod for ACorsa and they got them in there. Did you do ANYTHING the real drivers said.Their is NOWAY Lewis played this game and liked it (Codes stated he gave it a go on many occasions) I bet he was like ""damn its just like driving the real thing, the steering and FFB is so close to real life, Ive always wanted a bathtub racing sim, so when do I play F1"" (MODERS have got FFB to feel good). YEA, YEA everyone says FFB is a personal thing, BS there is GOOD force feedback (fools your brain into thinking your driving a car and BAD FFB you can tell your playing a game) This is the latter. There is NOWAY you can sitdown in cockpit view and tell me it feels like your behind the wheel of an F1 car. (Modders in Acorsa have captured that terror and thrill)Why is their NO telemetry in this game, not FFB cliping tool, no brake or gas tool? Ohh, because its a sim and you don't need those in a sim. LOLBack when i was a Child i enjoyed childish things, but as i grew older in sim racing I have learned to leave childish things behind. F1 2015 is to me childish, If you like the game more power to you, i wish i could, man do i wish i could. Go back to a time when i didn't know what sim racing was, what FFB meant, what FOV or telemtry was. Back to a time when i thought GT and Forza where sooo cool.Own a modded t500rsI5 oc 4 ghz770 oc8g ram			",157,22,6,9,1,0,8

												It seems that what they call a 'next-gen' F1 game is releasing an empty game with stripped out features and a glitchy mess.Pros:The graphics are a decent step up and runs mostly smooth on my PC.The handling model and traction feel a lot better than 2014.The new menus are a nice step up from the plain old ones.The sound is improved compared to 2014.Inclusion of the 2014 season.Cons:It is quite clear that some graphics though were given more polish than others. The cars look nice and the night tracks have great lighting but the character models still look last-gen.Not a major con but the commentary can sound pretty forced at times.The AI is a lot more challenging which is good but at times they don't seem to acknowledge your exsistence and are happy to cut you off, clip your tyre and block you on your qualifying lap.I can live with not being able to put my name in on career mode but it seems that all depth has been taken out and just feels like a glorified quick race mode.As someone who does simracing, the force-feedback was pretty lackluster on my G27 wheel.Various graphical and HUD glitches. (Anyone want to race against floating sets of tyres?)I didn't even bother with online but from what I've heard it's pretty broken.I was hoping for big things jumping into next-gen but this feels like an empty and lackluster experience. Probably rushed out to make a quick buck and as the only official F1 game, this is unacceptable. It's not horrible but is slightly above average at best. I wanted to like this game but I couldn't get much out of it. You're better off with F1 2013 which I still consider the best out of Codemaster's F1 lineup.			",35,5,14,1,4,0,2

												No TrackIR supportNo SLI supportBarely looks better than last year (and I'm playing on the max settings)It's Formula One. If you've played the others, you know what to expect - fast cars go around a track. It hasn't really changed all that much, even with the new engine. For me, it runs decently (i7 4790k@4.5/16GB RAM/SLI 980). Hangs around 80fps, though did drop to 50 at one point. Many people have severe framerate issues though. For what it is, it's not that well optimised if it requires a 970.What really gets me is the lack of TrackIR support. TrackIR is a headtracking tool that allows you to look around by moving your head in real life. In these racing games, it's really quite useful. Dirt Rally has it. The older F1 titles have it. F1 2015? Nope. If you go into proper first person mode with the camera, you lose half of your mirrors. You can use a button to look left or look right, but this removes the front view. With TrackIR I could just move my head slightly, still be able to see out the front and see the entire mirror. Handling I found was pretty decent, really light on the Force Feedback though, can be changed in the settings at least.The AI is not all that great. I'm pretty sure they should avoid crashes whereever possible, but they instead like to just ram me out of the way. Even on the starting grid, I was messing about looking for the look left button and wasn't moving, but a car decided to just drive straight on into me instead. Maybe he should have gone to Specsavers.They've fixed some crashes, but I still had a crash in the menu.Sound is poorly mixed. The pit crew is barely audible. From what I can hear, it's some poor voice acting.Also, it might interest you to know that the console users can communicate with their pit crew via commands over the microphone. Codemasters decided to leave it out of the PC version.Conclusion: Buy the older titles, this is yet another rubbish port of the console version.			",430,77,16,38,89,3,58

												The driving physics itself isn't bad at all, its a massive improvement from other titles, and the AI is very competitive and fun (I simrace, and it was awesome to see that when I drove as Massa in the Williams on legendary AI I slotted a realistic 5th behind the Ferraris and Mercedes, even though I gave it my best). Where they dropped the ball though was the TONS of little annoying bugs which really give this game an unfinished feeling (early access-ish), and the biggest problem for me: The blurry graphics.

I haven't experience any crashes, any problems with button assignments, any technical difficulties what so ever.  I play the game on 5760 x 1080 and it runs at 60FPS with everything on ultra (or whatever the highest setting is)The only issues with the game is setting up the force feedback, it's very mellow to start off with and it does take a couple of hours to set it up properly. AI is way too aggressive, they seem to crash at me randomly completely wiping me out. I play the game using the G27 wheel.The game is quite challenging on Legend difficulty, but I'm not sure what's causing all these technical difficulties for people.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off, I'm playing on Linux with an i7-4770k, GTX 770 4GB, 16 GB ram and a driving force GT (DFGT).Feral Interactive did the port, and based on others reviews it seems they made it work better than Windows. Sure there's slightly worse performance and a few bugs here and there, but generally it's working great. Best of all, Feral responds to bug reports and actively tries to help!Performance wise I get a steady 40-50 FPS with spikes up to 90-100. More consistent FPS would be nice, but it's an issue out of Ferals control. The game has never crashed for me either. Sound has wigged out once, but a simple restart of the game fixed it.AI seems to be a popular complaint as well. I fully agree that they need improving, especially when they get blue flagged. It doesn't ruin the game for me though. I'd be happier seeing more AI difficulty options or at least less drastic skill differences between difficulties. The jump from hard to expert or legend is just a bit too big, especially when comparing qualifying performance to race performance (AI performs better in the race).The final thing I'd like to see improved is Linux wheel support. If I wasn't as familiar with Linux, I'd have a hard to sorting out the wheel settings. For anyone running into problems my strategy has been to use ltwheelconf to set turn radius and such, then use jstest-gtk to calibrate the wheel and peddles. It has to be done once per time the wheels power is disconnected or your computer is restarted. I also set the steering saturation in game to around 40-60, otherwise the in game wheel isn't quite in sync.			",224,58,8,16,38,4,38

												Edit: Dropped recommendation for now (as of July 14th)---------------------------------------------------------So after a year of hiatus, I decided to give a shot on F1 2015. After a few minutes spent on the track, my first impressions are of mixed-bag...Good:-Massive improvement on engine (PU) sounds compared to F1 2014-Significantly better looking than F1 2013.-Handling is very good (with a joypad)-Podium Cutscenes (but I don't mind about the in-game narrator)-Well optimized. Runs at 60fps with a r9 270, i7 4770 on medium/highs after driver update-Almost instant flashbacks, and because of the AI's behaviour, it's a relief-Can change race settings during loadingBad:-No safety car-Damage physics are several steps backwards compared to previous installments-Can't disable texture blur-Penalty system seems more lenient on crashes-Split-screen taken away-The McLaren Honda engine sounds terrific...-Online features are broken. When I hosted one game, there were 10 players, but when I start the race, all players but one just disappeared and the game kicked me to the main menu due to ""not enough players"". Also when I join a lobby, I'm always kicked from the start. Bring back open lobbies, and fix this please !-AI is aggressive on Medium and Hard setting, they pushed me several times out of the track.When they get ahead thanks to DRS and/or a superior power unit, the AI just changes its trajectory and brakes hard, preventing the player to overtake back and get the nose stuck to their rear-end instead...Can't imagine Pro Mode without flashbacks then (or with a non-Mercedes powered car ).Mediocre-...but still sounding dull , especially on downshifts and in the pit lane-lack of personality. I personally appreciate the scrapping of the tutorial mode on single player and the email messaging system on career mode. Championship mode is enough for me, but I guess I'm in a part of the minority on that one-the game crashes on exit-Non realistic practices sessions-the steering wheel display could display more useful information -still no installation lap...-sometimes, the leaderboard is not getting updated in time trial mode (bug)-the HUD has not evolved much since F1 2010-Penalty system for corner cutting is annoying: it doesn't mind if you cut on Chicane at Spa and gained 1 full second, but it gives a 10-second penalty (25%race) when putting 2 tires out on 130 R and losing some time at Suzuka. Ridiculous.ConclusionThe series have been overhauled with a 'new' game engine, but it's hampered by teething issues and limitations so it needs some maturation before the major bugs get ironed out, and more features to come for the next year. 6.3/10.

												Update 3 : 21/08/15 : Man, this game just keeps getting worse. I now get full AI opponents in a multiplayer lobby. THat's it. I'm never paying for a Codemasters F1 game ever again.Update 2 : 04/08/15 : This edit is regarding the 31/07 patch. After playing the game for 4 days after the patch, it seems like the Codies are making slow progress towards fixing the patches. A lot of annoying bugs have been ironed out and framerates during gameplay is also much better but they have yet to fix one major issue with this game and that is MULTIPLAYER. It is more broken now than ever. I just can't find one single lobby or hopper or whatever they're calling it now to play in. This needs a fix and my review will stay negative till then.Update 1 : 23/07/15 : Okay, it seems the 20/07 patch pushed in by the codies has fixed a few issues like framerate drops and crashes but it does not fix ALL the issues. There are still a few stutters here and there and needs a lot more fixing. The multiplayer is still broken and I'm still getting kicked from sessions for no bloody reason so my recommendation is still a NO.ORIGINAL REVIEW : This game...this could be so much more than it is right now. I don't know where to begin. This game is just BROKEN.The graphics are an obvious improvement from the previous titles and the handling seems a bit realistic than before but you buy racing games to have fun and I don't think I've had much fun with this game until now.The game is marred with bugs and the multiplayer is just broken. I joined a hopper sprint in excitement to play my first ever multiplayer online on this game and the race doesn't start for me. I know this because the other people in the lobby keep screaming at each other that they someone rammed into someone else and he had to lose his front wing, etc. So, I decide to quit and rejoin the hopper. I have no idea how but the hopper shows that I finished second and scored 18 points. As I rejoined the hopper, the other guys got furious at me and started abusing me and questioning me as to how I scored 18 points when I left the lobby and kicked me from the game. What a horrible experience that was. I still haven't come around to playing one single multiplayer game. What a shame!As to the Championship Mode, it's a meh. I have no idea why Codemasters decided to take away the customization options as to how one approaches a weekend race, be it one shot quali, short weekend or the full weekend experience. All that is gone now and you are left with no choice to play the game by their rules. Such a fail!The quick race mode is nothing new. Just play a boring single race and come back to the home screen. Not much improvement other than that.I haven't played the pro-season mode yet and I don't feel like I should be playing it either as you won't have any sort of assists and camera customization options and since I use a keyboard and not a racing wheel, it is almost impossible to control the oversteer on the cars in this game without traction control cranked to full. This is another one of those meh issues in the game.The graphics are great but the optimization for the PC is terrible. TERRIBLE! This could've been done so much more better. There are also just so many bugs in the game, it just takes away the enjoyment of racing an F1 car. The pit-lane graphics and sounds are just horrible and there are sudden framerate drops all over. There is nothing we can do but hope that the Codies fix this stuff in the coming patches.If you are really interested in F1 and want to immerse youself in an experience which is enjoyable as well as challenging, I suggest you buy the F1 2010 or 2013 game(s). These guys are just taking more stuff away with every iteration of the game.			",91,4,8,4,5,0,1

Loads of glitches and there not the glitches you can ignore and carry on playing these glitches stop you playing with lots of crashes and parts of the game not working. I have 3 hours recorded and thats 3 hours of editing files to get this game running properly.

												As of writing, release day, this game has serious issues on the PC platform. Consider this before buying.== GAMEPAD / INPUT ==01. If you are using a game pad (Xbox 360 or Xbox One), wait for a patch before you buy the game. Currently this game doesn't work as advertised with mentioned peripherals. Buttons ""B"" in menu system are actually ""A"" when pressed. In the game itself it's even worse: The defaults are messed up unlike in previous F1 titles by Codemasters. If you start a race, you're engine is revving, but you just can't do a bloody thing... Remapping the buttons doesn't help either - the Xbox gamepad just isn't supported as it's advertised.02. No sliders & adjustments for deadzone and input control. Every racing game should have this, especially those who advertise themselves with a ""pro season"" mode, aka, some sort of== GAME CONTENT ==03. There's no more scenarios. I kind of miss that, it gave some sort of extra to tinker with. A different challenge.04. There's no other challenges other than time trial, quick race and season modes. So no earning ""medals"" etc.. No leaderbords online? Ugh...I could go on, but essentially, codemasters needs to fix the game first. I'll go back to playing DiRT Rally for now - because there my Gamepad does work, there I can safely rebind keys and edit settings.. And oddly, it's the same company. Go figure...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Horrible Interface! I use triple screen and two separate custom controls for pedals and wheel.1. 2013 & 2014 allowed me to setup the aspect ratio and it looked great. 2015 doesn't so everything is streched out.2. 2013 & 2014 allowed me to setup my controls perfectly. 2015 doesn't, it conflicts with both so I can't drive.3. My ESC key doesn't work when racing. 4. Bench Mark just crashed the game.Horrible, horrible start. Code Masters: Why would you go backwards in terms of the controls setup??I own all the racing games out there and this is the first one which my custom controls won't work with! I will start looking for help from other players to see if they have a mod for my issue but if not, I'll be returning the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												MY GOD THIS GAME IS SCREWED!I have played a lot of racing games in the past and have previously played F1 2011, F1 2012 and F1 2014. I was really hyped for this game, but my god they screwed it up.+Better and cleaner UI+Better AI, the AI actually overtakes you this time+Beautiful lighting+Realistically modeled cars+You can push the car more due to less unpredictable wheelspin+Both the 2015 and the 2014 F1 seasons are playable+Better commentery/tv-style+Tire sqeal can finally be heard properly-Game crashes alot-FPS drops are common, dropping to 9 FPS and staying there very frequently-Colours are very washed out-I cannot look back in the 3rd person view-Engine sounds are far too quiet-Limited Anti-Aliasing options, WHERE IS MSAA?-Blur, motion blur cannot be deactivated, WTF?-No introduction scene before the race start like in previous games-AI likes to punt you in the wall in some corners, for example Eau Rouge-The graphics are messed up, everything is very blury and smeary, absolutely horrific, WTF HAPPENED?-No safety car, WTF ARE YOU THINKING CM?-No Co-op, WTF ARE YOU THINKING CM?-FFB is horribly weak and inacurrate, almost no effects, worse than every before in a CM F1 game, WTF HAPPENED?-Why is it not possible to adjust each session length in championship mode?-Damage model is pathetic and far too forgiving, wait is this 2005 or 2015?-Rev counter on the steering wheel is still broken and far too short like in F1 2014-ALT+TAB does not work properly-Hardly any tire smoke when locking up-Long loading timesPC specs: i7 4790k, r9 290, 16GB DDR3, G27 for more info see my profileAll in all I cannot recommend this game in its current state, the game is completely screwed, lacking featuires and will make you want to buy a pair of glasses. To be honest F1 2014 is probaly a better buy. I think I might test Steam's refund policy.10.07.2015, F1 2015 v.1.0-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT:So after raging quite a bit yesterday I completed a few 25% quick races on different tracks with some of the 2015 and 2014 spec F1. Championship mode is literally unplayable due to it bein at 9 FPS the entire time. So in this small list I will go into the actual racing aspect of F1 2015 and the changes compared to last years game.+Handling model has been vastly improved, more traction, less unpredictable wheelspin, the rear of the car is still quite a challenge which is good+The AI actually races you this time around, there is lots of wheel to wheel action, and the AI even completes switchback moves and dosen't back out of a move very often+Pits stops are now just as quick as in real life and the times vary per team and your crew can mess up+The AI is not as slow on the first lap, like in previous games+Fuel management is now realistic becuase upshifting early and lifting and coasting actually make a difference+The AI race each other with realistic consequences+Front wing gets damags more easily+The effects of dirty are are noticable+Wet racing is possible again, due to the AI not being overpowered anymore+AI make mistakes and it is great to see them having to deal with oversteer and slipping on the grass+The sparks that fly from the car directly infront of you are implemented very well+Penalty system usually fairly affects AI cars+Racing is just more fun with all cars batteling each other a lot of the time, going 3-wide into corners and stuff like that+AI causes crashes+More cinematics, grid walk podium etc.+You can ask the engineer for information-AI is not aware of you when it is rejoining the track and subsequently knocks you off-AI cars which need to be lapped do not get out of the way most of the time, therefore endangering your race-The rev counter on the in-game steering wheel is still wrong, just like last year-When exiting the pits with the pit assist option deactivated you are stuck in 2nd gear, therefore you lose a lot of time-The AI is always, and I repeat ALWAYS faster than you in a straight line, I have had Mclaren-Hondas pull away from me whilst I am driving a Force India and using DRS-2015 and 2014 car balance is not correct: 2015: Mclaren, Red Bull, Sauber too strong; Mercedes powered cars too weak (The cars are correctly balanced when you are driving them, but not when the AI is driving them, 2014: Mclaren is too powerful, haven't tested the rest (Again the AI cars are not balanced for example the Marussia is not runnung in the back like the Caterhams are)-There are alot of races where the weather is grey and dark and it is raining, but the track dosen't look wet and the dry tires work significatly better than the intermediates-The AI like to drive away from you in a train most of the time and you don't have a chance due to them blitzing down the straights-The damage model is pathetic and way too forgiving most of the time-The side pod glitch has kinda moved to the area between the sidepod and the front wheels, touch a car there and you just spin-The fuel mode menu is too slow, so that it takes too long to switch between modes whilst driving-The ""talk to the engineer menu"" dissapears way to quickly after opening it, therefore rendering it useless-No tire smoke when youn lock tyres, or cars spin, therefore there are no immersive ""trying to avoid an incident which has occured ahead"" moments-Blury graphics and motion blur really strain the eyes after ~30 mins-When it start raining and you have to change ti intermidiate tyres and you do so on your schedueled pit stop and haven't used the menu to select the intermidiate tyres, you will have slicks put on during the pit stop, this affects the AI most of the time too-DRS is often enabled in wet conditions-A lot of scenarios where you better of with slicks on a wet trackAll in all the actual racing have vastly improved over last years game, now if codies would just address the blury graphics, add MSAA then this review would be positive and this game would be worth a buy.

I have not played much of the multiplayer over the free weekend however so if that is what you are interested in primarily I would seek a secondary opinion.

												Well here we go again.The second racing title in a few months to basically be broken out of the Box. Maybe F1 2015 and Project Cars are part of a elaborate joke on the sim racing enthusiast world. (I use Sim lightly, both are not sims)After Headaches from Project Cars bugs, I was hoping for a racing game that would have less bugs. Now have 2 frustrating games that have rediculous issues.Getting booted from MP on the Grid as race starts - (Others have reported also)Even a Banned message when trying to Start a Custom MP Race - (Restart Game fixes). Wheel feedback almost non existent out of the box - (tweaking required but still not happy with it but better than default)AI running up your back, they are meant to be F1 drivers not the general public. - (I can get run into from Multiplayer). Useless button config menu's. - (After so many F1 titles you would think they would know users want to change these)Sound is so low I need to turn volume on speakers up full to hear, even after setting in game.Graphics should look crisper but no they are blurry.No-one playing Multiplayer or at least can't find games in Australia.In Multiplayer Lobby as new players enter countdown restarts from 60 sec (get to 5 seconds to go, new player enters back to 60 second countdown)Just not happy with look and feel (Would get refund but bought from 3rd Party)Lets just hope Codemasters F1 Team will patch and fix issues quicker than Project Cars has.A complete disapointment at the moment			",15,1,2,0,1,0,0

												The best CM F1 game is still F1 2010 or 2011. GG CM GG. I defended this game after the 24H after patch. i played it for a 14H and then left it because of small faults i thought they should fix. I then saw that updates for the problems should be fixed, so on August 8 i tried it out and...The game crashes 24/7 again! AI is undescribebly bad! The car now has the record of best understear! and the force feedback isjust vibations! Try to play a game with the G27 whithout FFB.It is impossible.Please just ripp the license for F1 games from CM and give it to some body else.

												A fun racing title with some serious issues.The good: - multiplayer racing with friends is great fun - much better physics than previous titles in the series - nice and playable with both controllers and with wheels - lots of patches from codemasters this time to fix bugs and to update the cars performance and visuals - includes both the 2014 and 2015 seasonsThe bad: - no career mode - no classic F1 mode - AI on the hardest difficulty (Legend) is too easy - even with all of the patches, still a bit buggyOn balance - I got a lot of fun out of this game - mostly in multiplayer. The next title in the series (F1 2016) should hopefully correct the missing career mode.I'd like to see in future titles: - a way to set up a race to start dry and have rain start during the race, or to start wet and have rain stop during the race. Ideally so I could set it to start raining on lap X of a race, or set it to stop raining on lap X. - custom grids (like F1 2006 on PS3 had) - the ability to set up any starting grid you want - the return of classic F1 cars			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Everyone has an open mic because that's the only option. Can't mute people. Get kicked randomly from online games (it's the servers doing it, not people). Lag is a massive issue, like people are teleporting all over the ♥♥♥♥ing place. Positions aren't always correct, like i was third at one point and it said i was eighth, and then it said i was first and i won the race, then hate to wait 20 minutes for a guy that was still on lap 1 going 2mph to finish the race. No cool career mode where you have your own character. Acceleration and braking online with a controller has no sensitivity, so you either tap it a little and it'll accelerate massively or not. Every time someone joins the lobby, an extra minute is added to the launch time. When you tab out, the resolution of the game ♥♥♥♥s up and the size goes all weird, resulting in you having to go back to settings and change it all to 1920x1080 etc. Not user friendly. Doesn't give you a description of what some game modes are. No tutorial. Characters look worse than Garry's mod characters. Got a headache from foreigners talking to their families while racing, and hearing them tapping their buttons away. This was all within 90 minutes of playing.			",22,0,2,1,3,0,0

												Has crashed twice in about five minutes. Missing Career mode and a host of other well liked features from the previous games (no career and no safety car for instance). Codemasters had an opportunity here to put together the best of all previous titles. A new engine and a mid season release for the first time. Sadly that opportunity is wasted. Hopefully these missing modes will get patched in and the crashing and other graphical anomalies fixed. This game is also missing the speculated day 1 patch. Would not recommend this game in it's current state. After the snafu that was Batman Arkham Knight, one would imagine publishers and developers would be particular about releasing sub-standard titles or at least in a buggy state. Clearly this isn't the case. I skipped 2014 because I thought they would bring all the advances made there to this release. I was mistaken. In what I view as an attempt to simplify or streamline the process of getting into a car and racing. Much of the flexibility has been lost. Polish of a few features is appreicated, but not at the expense of removing other much appreciated game modes and configuration options. One has no need for the 2014 season when the game of the matching year is readily available. Given that F1 2014 offers more in terms of gameplayt than 2015, why would one want a severly stripped down version of 2014 in this year's title? It is anything but a step forward. Avoid for now, perhaps forever. Codemasters may need to try again in 2016, but I'll not give them the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps I'll try 2017 again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Looks have improved, if not amazing, but better. To my mind it feels enjoyable and challenging with all assists off.Now here's the rub, forgetting the lack of features, because as far as I am concerned, if this game played as it should, I'd have overlooked that being this is a rewritten engine etc.There are a few bugs and niggles but I have played many of the other games and for all their faults there was never a problem with the force feedback. This game has so little sensation of wheel weight or contact with road surface. and I have a wheel that works fine with previous games. So how many weeks will I have to wait before my wheel gives me the proper sensation of racing? I have posted so much on the forum, and yet nothing. All I ask is that it works with my steering wheel like it used to. Or like it does with project cars to be honest, as that does a better job.Till then I won't recommend it to anyone and Codemasters really let me down this time and I'm usually a patient gamer.*edit: I have a new wheel now, (T300) and the feeling is better with this wheel, but I am still not happy with this game overall. The feedback is passable, but should be better and have much more flexible option to adjust. Thing is, this is a console game first and a PC game second, which is a shame. Codemasters support for this game is almost non-existant as well, and the same errors creep into the game year on year.I hope that from the news I am hearing, Codemasters are going to focus on their key franchises from here on in, and if they want my help, they will get it. The potential has always been there, F1 one on early -access anyone? Maybe we will get that telemetry we have wanted for ages after all.			",90,10,23,4,10,3,17

Between the force feedback being a gentle tickle, the sluggish responses and that wierd blur when you're on track, none of which have appeared in any other the other F1 titles I've played, or Project Cars e.t.c...It's a shame, because while otherwise there are some nice changes, when I can get a couple of corners with responses in the same timezone as me the handling model really has improved over F1 2014. Sure I miss proper career mode but I spent most of my time in time trial anyway. Anyway, much more and I'll really ramble.

												Well F1 2015 is definite disappointing. Obviously they use a so-called new engine as they announced, because everything including menu is different. I admit there is some improvement in graphics and car handling. TC is way effective than it was, which may be a good thing to novice. However, the game crashes sometimes, which is the reason that makes me write thiss comment. When I feeling exhausted trying to finish 58 laps at Australia Grand Prix, the game crashed around 43th lap, with no save left. I mean, seriously? Also the line the AIs take when you try to pass them a lap ahead (Blue Flag) totally does not make any sense. They run out of the track to let you pass!? That is just ridiculous. The last but not the least, when using flash back, there is a short burst when resuming the game.Overall:Pros:Good raphicsSound tracks are fineDriving assists are helpful for noviceCons:Too many glitchesGame may crashThe interface is so different from F1 2014 and earlier that it does not feel like F1 2015			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have to press X to Go Back.4- Customizing the button layout for the speed wheel controller is messed up (it doesn't recognize the buttons)5- It assumes there are LB and RB buttons on the wireless xbox speed wheel controller.6- I think there are alot missing of the Setup and Settings options from F1 2014.The Good:- Visually, it looks amazing.- Sounds (Audio), Very good.Unfortunately I couln't play it much becuase of the lack of the controller support. I wish I had more Good to say but I really couldn't play it. I couldn't test the car physics cause the deadzones and sensitivity of the controller are very wacked.If you have F1 2014... then do NOT get this game until they fix their controller support and the other settings issues. I'm very glad I didn't uninstall the previous game.It is very amazing how anyone can mess up a very good game in a year.  CodeMasters, please fix it asap. Thank you.			",19,26,6,1,8,0,0

												Completely underwhelming in comparison to Project Cars. Following install the game failed to start, blank screen for a few minutes and then thrown back to the desktop.  After a couple more tries I restarted my computer and the game finally loaded.  I set everything to Ultra and then ran benchmark.  Noticed the left rear tyre flashing in out of existence when the camera was following my car from behind, minor glitch maybe.  Seeing that my 980Ti easily delivered around 120fps 1440p I decided to engage vsync to limit the game to 60fps as there is no point wasting all that electricity on all those extra frames.  Graphically the game looks a bit cartoonish to me and feels more like an arcade game than a simulation. Hitting walls and other cars doesn't seem to cause any harm or damage, which kind of suprised me as F1 2010 definately felt like a simulation and in my view remains the better game.  On completing a quick race I noticed some rather more serious screen glitches in the post race sequences, though again I expect this will be fixed in future updates or drivers.  Also the replays seem to be fixed at 30fps which is strange. After another quick flick through the menus and not finding anything new of interest I had a quick race around Monaco and found this offered little excitment.  On quitting the game I was presented with Steam error 41; which is a new one for me; something about servers being overloaded or something but to be honest by this point I was beyond caring.  It remains disappointing that Codemasters do not support my old Microsoft Sidewinder wheel and peddles; particuarly given that Project Cars does; so instead I have to use an Xbox joypad. For me this speaks volumes about the quality of the games, attention to detail and the values of this company.  Overall, if you are formula one nut and have a compatible steering wheel then maybe you'll enjoy this game but anyone who has played Project Cars will feel completely underwhelmed by quality of this game.

												I like it. It's not perfect but once i'm in a session i really enjoy it.I play with traction control set to med all other assists off. Hopefully i can turn this off soon too!My system is:i7 2600k16gb ram (I use dim drive and load the game into ram)R9 380 4gbDriving force gt wheel and pedal setCons: Weather forecast for race weekend missing, i can't set my car up for the race in qualifying if i don't know what the weather forecast is. DRS open conformation would be nice too, maybe flashing like it used to.Benchmark test crashes the game.No career mode (would be nice to have for some people but i play full race weekends over and will probably only get 2 full seasons out of it before 2016 is released)Pros:Force feedback is good. Tied in with that is the tire model. It took me an hour to get to grips with the game but once i did, i combined what i felt through the wheel with what i thought the car was doing and what the tire and brake temps were to drive the car. Now my tires generally surpass the initial pit window estimate while only losing 1.5-2 secs at end of life. I'm very rarely hard on the gas or brake anymore. I like the penalty system over old versions of the game as it is now more lenient and just give warnings for minor contact rather than a tour of the pits. i enjoy the commentary as well.Formation lap, different cut videos, etc, would be nice but i don't feel like they would add significant value to the experience.If you like f1 and are thinking about it, buy it!

												Random crashes to desktop (pressing pause button on Xbox1 controller. Fast forwarding through session while in pit) The parts that I have gotten to play are great, the handling is so much better. But, they should not be charging €50 to play what is effectively now an early access game because of all these game breaking bugs! Come on Codies, time to shine and get this fixed before you have an Arkham Knight part deux on your hands!I do not recommend purchasing this game in its current state.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There is a lot of trash talk and dissapointment about this game. I think it deserves better reviews. Sure, the lack of the progressive season mode is a shame but when you get past that, the improvements far outweight that small negative (that said, I don't do multiplayer so have no opinion on pro's or cons).The physics of the car are out of this world. I had F1 2013 and it felt like the car was on rails. The F1 2015 cars feel like they are on the edge when you're lapping. You can FEEL the understeer and oversteer through the wheel and putting together a fast lap is very rewarding as the physics will punish you for over-doing things.Tyre degradation and fuel management are now in your hands. You can slow down a tad and save tyres and fuel to change your race strategy. There is no option to change strategy before the race starts but you aren't ""forced"" to pit like in F1 2013. If you choose to race flat out, you will have to make an extra stop compared to a more conservative approach..The only other oddity is the AI speed. On Hard, it's fairly easy to qualify and race in the top three. Moving up to Expert, I was struggling to get in the top ten. Hopefully they'll patch it to make the gap a bit less radical. The AI also has a propensity to punt you off the track from time to time. Generally they race very well and you can force them into mistakes but it's very irritating to be on the correct line and suddenly ""BOOM"" you're spinning off the track.I highly recommend giving it a try. If you are bent out of sdhape by the lack of the young driver program you are missing out on a great racing sim for something that was only a fraction of the game.			",4,0,2,0,2,0,2

												This game is an ultimate money scam. When the game came out it was already bad enough on the PC but some of the recent patches have improved the experience on the PC. However with this latest patch the AI is even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ than ever. Racing as Bottas I was confidently leading the Australian Grand Prix until the second to last lap where my team mate who was already lapped tries to be some sort of hero and he goes on to overtake me. He crashes into the back of me and then we both go completely spinning. Luckily I was 30+ sec ahead so I was still able to get back on track to lead the race. Then on the last lap my car goes absolutely bonkers and decides to stop working on the last couple of corners for no apparent reason. After being sent spinning again another car completely smashes into me and I have to retire a couple of corners from victory. With this latest patch the AI is even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in getting out of the way when they are lapped. Instead of  pulling to the side they go completely straight out into a wall and most likely end up damaging their front wing or the entire car. And there are other problems like sitting on your team mate' ghost car when you go to pit or not getting out of the pits as well.There are other massive issues like big FPS drops when the into is played in the rain. I could go on and on.Do not buy this.			",23,0,1,6,5,0,7

												EDIT - dunno what you did but a couple of updates later and it's a lot more playable and I'm competing for race wins. I have to get in the Ferrari to do it, obviously, but it's something. Well done, keep up the good work.You guys have neutered a game that had potential. In some ways the cars behave more like their real life counterparts. The AI is better. But this S.O.B of a game just does not work properly, and you've nixed loads of features that had no business being removed. I don't know if you panicked because you figured this game was your last chance to redeem yourself, but you picked a terrible time to mess up. I regret buying this thing, and I've really enjoyed the F1 series up to now. Hopefully you can iron out some of the bugs and glitches, but it's the missing features that confuse me the most. I have no idea what you were thinking. Better luck next time chaps.			",93,30,18,7,54,1,11

												I have always loved their F1 games however so far this has been the biggest waist of my money ever. I have had nothing but problems with this game.1. My G25 wheel and peddles,  which has worked on every other racing game without fail now has so many issues. This game will not allow me to use the brake and accelerator because they both register as (slide 1) which means that its one or the other and I have to use my clutch as the brake which gives me no feel. When I contacted Codemasters I got a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t generic reply stating that I am able to custemise the controlls. Which from owning all of their other games I am well aware of but is totaly useless when their game registers multiple peddles as the some one. Not to mention that their standatd G25 controlls do not even allow the use of the peddles.2. When I play their fancy new PRO SEASON which I was really looking foward to which is meant to have no assists and hardest difficaulty. When I stared first prectice in melbourne all assists a ON and I mean ALL assists. And No i was not in the other championship moad because that works fine with all assists off. The PRO mode, even thought is says that the assists are off still displays the racing line along with all other assissts. Again when I contatcted Codmasters their reply was that I shound just turn them off. Which I cant because its PRO mode and it says they are already off.If anyone have any resolutions to these issues please leat me know because at this point the game is unplayable, I've wasted money and Im going back to play Project cars and F1 2014 until they are fixed.

												This isnt a bad racing game. It isnt the best out there by far. I have been enjoying the free weekend and most likely will by it. What this game has is the license to Formula 1. I wish they would make some classic formula One game with cars from the 90s that would be great. The graphics are good but project cars is way better as far as feel of the car and rain affects but anyway. The multiplayer isnt that bad you can either do a hopper if feelin lazy or set up a little gp weekend.I recommend this game for 21 dollars no more though			",27,0,16,2,0,0,0

												(US)In game there is no normal management. Instead of making on shooters or w, s, d, an as in the majority of games. It is necessary to play with absolutely not convenient management where space is a gas, and a brake or a backing of Ctrl.At management of a menu and any parameters completely there is no mouse, to have to press on the keyboard and to wait so far to be exposed the necessary parameter, at the same time there is no acceleration of scrolling, wait almost like on seconds. I.e. if you have to change that that from 0% to 100% or is oboratno spent a lot of time, I will repeat mice there in general isn't present, even in settings only the keyboard works!!!If you decides to curtail game, it will get out over everything and also it will be stirred how it is impossible to correct. Besides she changes the full-screen mode on window, at the same time your permission isn't considered, to be put 800х600 and the minimum settings. And at a turn (restoration in the full-screen mode) she keeps the minimum settings from which there comes the seasickness attack.On the one hand the good graphic component of game, everything looks красвиво relatively, is realistic probably.With another not so convenient management, isn't similar at all that developing game, it has been provided, the fact that it will come to the personal computer. To spend more than 4 hours in her not perhaps pulls to vomit. Of course, if you plays with friends With another everything isn't convenient at all! Probably game was made more as the appendix to a prefix. That she is played on the computer by razraba probably wanted to spit.Game is made as full not respect for the PC user, and is similar to it have made not small efforts.I doubt that it will be eliminated and will enter more or less some convenience to people who use not only the keyboard, and in a waiting time curtail game. We will hope for the best. Drifts on a grass same as on asphalt. Well... For that in online to race on the first turn to you can drive in a bochina, drag meters 50 to throw out about a board of the route and to write that you are guilty of everything. For that if you drive, the car as the tank at the opponent even on 10 cm not to shift, not to mention that that a nose to drag meters 5 as do with you. Also, together you watches games unnecessary in online races of video. Race expectation, viewing of video is occupied, etc. by more time than race.Also sometimes there is a problem with voice. If the webcam is connected, and in game settings the microphone is switched-off. That all the same happens that by some miracle you are heard by players. Also it is necessary to listen to other people who have a similar situation.It is impossible to turn off loading of mutter of other people, it is possible to reduce loudness to 0% besides handles holding an arrow of the keyboard, you will spend half-minute the runner so far to fall to 0%. Time of the player is absolutely invaluable. Don't appreciate absolutelyRUSВ игре отсутствует какое либо нормальное управление. Вместо того чтобы сделать на стрелках или w , s , d , a   как в большинстве игр. Приходится играть с совершенно не удобным управлением где space это газ , а тормоз или задний ход Ctrl.При управлении менюшкой и какими либо параметрами полностью отсутствует мышь, приходиться нажимать на клавиатуре и ждать пока выставиться нужный параметр, при этом ускорения прокрутки нет, ждёшь почти как по секундам. Т.е. если тебе надо изменить что то с 0% до 100% или оборатно тратится много времени, повторюсь мыши там вообще нет, даже в настройках  работает только клавиатура!!!Если решишь свернуть игру, она  вылезет поверх всего и будет мешаться  и это ни как исправить нельзя. Кроме того она изменяет полноэкранный режим на оконный, при этом ваше разрешение не учитывается, ставиться  800х600 и минимальные настройки. А при развороте ( востановлении в полноэкранный режим) она сохраняет свои минимальные настройки, от которых наступает приступ морской болезни.С одной стороны хорошая  графическая составляющая игры, всё выглядит красвиво относительно, реалистично наверное.С другой совсем не удобное управление, совсем не похоже что разрабатывая игру, было предусмотренно, то что она выйдет на пк. Провести больше 4 часов в ней не возможно тянет бливать. Конечно, если играешь с друзья С другой всё совсем не удобно! Похоже игру делали больше как приложение к приставки. О том что её играют на компьютере разрабы похоже пливать хотели.Игра сделана как полное не уважение к пользователю ПК, и похоже на это приложили не малые усилия.Я сомневаюсь что это устранят и введут более менее какое то удобство для людей которые пользуются не только клавиатурой, а во время ожидания сворачивают игру. Будем надеятся на лучшее. Заносы на траве такие же как на асфальте.. Мда... За то в онлайн гонке на первом повороте тебе могут вьехать в бочину, протащить метров 50 выкинуть об борт трассы и написать что во всём виноват ты. За то если ты вьедешь, машина как танк у противника даже на 10 см не сдвинуть, не говоря уже о том чтобы носом протащить метров 5, как делают с тобой.  Так же, вместе игры смотришь ненужное в онлайн гонках видео. Ожидании гонки, просмотр видео и т.д. занимают больше времени чем сама гонка.Так же иногда есть проблема с голосом. Если подключена веб камера, а в настройках игры микрофон отключён. То всё равно бывает , что каким то чудом тебя слышат игроки. Так же приходится слушать других людей, у кого похожая ситуация.Отключить загрузку бормотания других людей нельзя, можно уменьшить громкость до 0% опять же ручками держа стрелку клавиатуры, потратишь полминуты пока бегунок опуститься до 0% . Время игрока совершенно безценyо.  Не ценят совсем			",359,83,18,45,28,2,43

												Game is blurry...I tried recommended settings from other users in forums and even at 1920X1080 with all graphical settings set to Ultra, SAA off, post process and motion blur set to lowest it looks like I'm playing in 800X600. Tried every settings. The environnments are constantly flickering, especially trees which give headache and motion sickness. They said they have improved handling, but to me it's a step backward. Doesn't feel like a simulation any more. You can now recover from any drift before the car spin, and hitting grass at 250 km/h feels like your still driving on tarmac. What a disappointment. Game is very short on content too compared to previous games in the serie. Finally, it's not even possible to tweak X360 controller deadzone, sensitivity, etc. You can only remap keys and that's all! This game is a joke. How am I suppose to make great use of the turns apex with default controller sensitivity is beyond me...it's completely unplayable...the cars are way too twitchy!!

												Game is broken - - WHAT TROLL COVERS THE RIGHT SIDE MIRROR WITH REV/GEAR HUD !!!!UPDATE: Controller is now making the car move. However its quite ""choppy"" and feels like I am using a D-Pad and not an analogue stick.. Will see how it goes.UPDATE 2: The reason the car was not moving was due to the rear wheels spinning at MAX when no buttons were pressed, unable to get traction so car will not move. Nice waste of tyres.This still happens intermittantely and i need to restart the game to fix it. UPDATE 3: Whoever desisgned the HUD for the rev counter and poisitioned it over the right side mirror, is a ♥♥♥♥. The display is nice, but stupidly placed if I can not see what it on the right handside, behind me... Many crashes have happened Below is a list of issues with this title:The Race:- Starting a race, all you get is engine rev's and the car does not leave the grid. Changing gear works, but car does not move.Considering I cant move the car, I cant play this game.- WHAT TROLL COVERS THE RIGHT SIDE MIRROR WITH REV/GEAR HUD !!!!Good thing you can still see that mirror in most views but its covered by 2 of them.- Looking left and right in cockpit view (using 360 controller) sucks. You can't look a little left/right. Its either all the way or straight forward :-(Graphics:- Low frame-rate even on lowest settings- Subtitles are not in sync- Lots of screen tear- How do you turn the blur off?- Where are the advanced graphics settings?- Ability to use 2014's HUD for rev counter, gears, etc (as this obstrucs right side mirror in some views0Other:- Quitting the game causes the game to ""Crash to desktop""- Lack of advanced controller settings (Dead-Zone)- FIX:For those who run the game and nothing happens: 1. Right click game in Steam2. Click on ""Properties"" > ""local Files"" > ""Verify integrity of game cache""3. Restart PC and it should work.

												In my opinion F 1 2015 is a gem of a game to start.You have to believe that with this (core) next gen style format is bound to get better period.It's been over three weeks since the games release with multiple patches added and each time various issues have been fixed.So what I'm saying is, lets all of us do our part to assist CM in delivering the best F 1 racerever by continuing feedback and being a little more  patient than we have been in the past .First on the assist/feedback list is ensure that you have the latest drivers for everything that's connected to your PC,( Vid ,sound,MS update,steam client,verify integrity software,wheel /game pad drivers,etc ). And then after all you have done is checked off, then do the olde basic complete shutdown and restart.  Not to discourage anyone but remember that this game was designed for the state of the art peripheral components, so an upgrade may be possible. Don't get me wrong but I also experienced all the issues that everyone mentioned in previous posts, and I do not not have the strongest rig, but those steps (mentioned above) really helped me to play and enjoy  the Formula 1 series which I love so much.I hope this helps more virtual drivers out there to be able to get on the tracks and enjoy this beautiful Formula 1 game for our PC version and kick some next gen arses.

												Do NOT buy this game for full price! The plus points are: Better AI, better tyre wear, better looks and it is harder to drive the car in general.The problem is this game has loads of bugs. AND they took off the red flags and the safety car. this game lacks long term motivation and variety between the races. The only thing that keeps me playing it is the racey AI. i bought it for 50% of the price via a sale. I think that is ok all in all. I personally hope F1 2016 has no bugs (if bugmasters can even do that) and inludes red flags and safety cars again. They don't even need to change too much on the AI or the feeling of the driving.

												i do not understand why everyone hates this game so much. For sure there are some bugs and the online part is very laggy but apart from that it is really good. The AI is the best i have ever seen in a racing game they divebomb you but they are still fair. The Handlingmodell is really good aswell in my opinion it is on par with the iRacing one in generall of course iRacing is a little bit more unforgiving but in terms of the actuall limit of the car f1 2015 is more realistic because I was faster in the iRacing Mclaren than i was in the f1 2015 one. I think if Codemasters improve the right things f1 2016 even gets close to the almighty rFactor2 which is probably the closest a game can get to real life prooven by the Formula 1 Teams who use the pro version of Rfactor2 for their simulators. In my opinion f1 2015 already beats iRacing and the very iRacing-ish Assetto Corsa although iRacing is used by a lot of professional drivers due to their huge community. F1 2015 is better because of some little things such as the unstability under breaking or the handling in the corners. As a guy who has driven a Formula Renault 2.0 car once i have to say the f1 2015 one is more challenging than the iRacing one. But again i have to say nothing gets even close to Rfactor2. My Ranking of the sims I have ever played ( in terms of realism and singleplayer)1. Rfactor2- very realistic Handling, good and challenging AI, great price2. F1 2015- quite realistic handling, very good and very challenging AI(the best out there),very good graphics( 2nd best to project cars)3. Assetto Corsa- good handling but a bit to slippery and simple sometimes, at least some AI4. iRacing-good but too slippery and simple handling, no AI but good community5. Project Cars- too simple and grippy Handling, bad AI, bad community but good graphics- the letdown of the last 5 years			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The handling imo is the best in the series but no way is this game worth the price it's asking. No Safety car, No multiple seasons, No career mode and throw in game breaking bugs like my pit crew won't change my damn tyres, the pit crew just basiclly freezes (Happened to me multiple times on both single & multiplayer) It's best to pick this up on sale, and hopefully Codemasters patch the game soon.

												I waited this game but now i got it i realize how big disapointment this is.-You cant create ""own career"" you must use F1 -2015 drivers.-Game graphics look nice but it takes everything out your computer (4790K & 295X2 & 32Gb Mem) and ultra settings you get 40 fps on pitlane??? Where Codemaster forgot game optimization. Usually fps around 60-88 but huge drop when pitting.-F1 2015 Need a huge patch asap. Game crashes also randomly.-I recommed to buy F1 2014 for sale and save your money. This is not worth to buy unless Codemasters fix problems and add better controller support. Game has very poor support for wheel and wireless wheels (xbox etc) Not work at all.-No safety car in races? Its not perfect in F1 2014 but it´s important when playing and you want race feeling!-AI is very or too aggressive and cause collisions.This is first feeling the game if game get updates i review this again.Update after two (2) patches.-First patch not solve game controller issues and no deadzone setup?-But it fixed benchmark crash after it is completed... ??? Who runs benchmark people want to play!-Some multiplayer problems fixed but still terrible. Hard to fix so i understand that.Well this second patch and game wont start anymore :DMaybe i go play F1 2014 and wait more patches...Update 22/8/15This game could compare Big Rigs game...

												I don't usually write reviews to games, so the fact am I doing it for this game, means something.In short....DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! (At least right now)This is yet again another lazy company, giving PC players a sub-par non working game, With the provision of ""patching"" it in the future. I am utterly disgusted that companies are allowed to get away with selling full price games, releasing a broken game which constantly crashes, black screens and sticks on loading screens. Pro-Mode is unplayable as it crashes everytime you enter it. The controller doesn't work on it! It always maps buttons whenever it feels like so you always have to keep changing the settings every thirty seconds. Honestly for a game I have been looking forward to on release, this is a massive dissapointment and has left a horrible taste in my mouth. I am getting closer to refusing to buy games on PC at launch anymore. It obvious companies don't have any respect for PC gamers, This is yet another piece of evidence we can use in the war on failed day one releases for PC.TL;DR Don't buy this game, because it doesn't work or function properly, go get Project Cars, at least that's in a playable state right now!

												*sees review again after several months* Why did I thumb this down? The game is not as bad as I thought it was back then, it's somewhere between a fully recommended thumbs up and a thumbs down. Read on if you want what I though of it back thenBroken with the same issues as its predecessors. Codemasters are incapable of making a good racing game these days. I got this free with a purchase of a laptop and even then I'm disappointed with it.The graphics look good on my gaming PC, better than F1 2013 (the last one I bought) and there are no issues there other than it can look cartoony due to the colour saturation. The driving is very smooth and for the most part the game plays at well over 60 fps on max settings, but there are cases where the performance just goes through the floor. And I don't mean consistently either, you can lap a track several times with no issues and then for whatever reason, on the following lap, the framerate will halve and stay there, feeling like a slideshow after playing at 80 fps or higher. The cars are very easy to drive and there's no real difificulty from the AI that I have seen. I have most of the assists off and use a gamepad, but the game doesn't seem to ever save my assist settings so I don't know if it reset my assists back to all enabled. I raced against medium AI around a couple of tracks and won the majority of races. Bear in mind I was in the Mercedes so a slower car would have faced more difficulty.The game is very light on features. There's no career, no online co op, no split screen (co op or otherwise) and I'm sure there's more missing. The session browser list for online is gone, instead there are hopper lobbies which take ages to fill up or are always empty. Once you're in an online game, it takes ages to load everyone in and once you're racing the poor penalty system will ruin your fun. Just had a race where I covered someone off on the inside line, they corner cut to overtake, hit me and take us both into the gravel and I got the penalty. Had another after that where I go to turn, accidentally tag somebody so I turn out to prevent causing an accident, still get the penalty (other player did spin though). If it weren't for the poor penalty system that seems too happy to dish out penalties I'd be more likely to recommend this game. This game also features non-existant force feedback. I can run over curbs and things and get no feedback from the controller. By comparison, Project Cars, you feel everything. I don't know what's good about this game really. Barebones features, poor penalty system, struggle to find games, takes ages to load everyone in, awful sound design, and not all that fun. 5 out of 10 at best			",25,3,8,1,3,0,0

But the game is missing alot of features i expected it to have, compared to older games, like co-op, career mode, safety car, ability to choose race and qualifying length etc. And WHY does the game have features that cannot be used in the PC version but can be used on console, ITS THERE, I CAN SEE ITS THERE, LET ME USE IT. And when the cars are to hard to drive around the tracks with a keyboard, compared to F1 2014 or older games, this whole poop 2015 game version making me... let say frustrated and disappointed in Codemaster			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												**Revwiew for PC** with GTX 760 (i7) - mostly medium to low settings @ minimum 58 fps.If your a fan of F1 but were a bit fed up with the prior Codemasters F1 efforts then you have to get this game.Great graphics, much improved AI, excellent replays with variable camera angles, adjustable cockpit camera angle, and wonderfully immersive physics ! The key to this game is understanding , as far as I have found out, is that the game is intended to be driven with 360* of wheel rotation unlike the prior gen console versions that I have played. This will give you 1:1 steering ratio when set up in your Logitech, or other branded, wheel profiler. Setting up my DFGT did take a bit more effort than ususal but feels great now.

												Don't see what all the complaining is about to be honest! For starters this game is a massive improvement upon F1 2014, both in the graphics side of the game, and in the actual racing/handling. Some may be annoyed with the lack of a proper ""career"" mode, but even in the previous iterations of the F1 games from Codies you were still technically driving as one of the actual drivers (their name on the car and race suit etc.), so overall this doesn't bother me. Online, while a little laggy, is good fun to play, and as I said above, the graphics have literally been overhauled and look absolutely stunning, even on a mid-budget system! Overall, 8/10 due to a few small bugs within the game, but as you can see Codies are pushing out patches once a week to fix the most common ones anyway			",9,1,4,0,0,0,0

												It's been quite a bit of a time and they've yet to fix the most important building block of an F1 game, FFB. I've always liked this series even it's console itterations and now I can hardly finish a few practice laps. I will say that it seem the throttle control, braking, and steering all seem better from pervious games, but without FFB it's impossible to push for the edge of grip and put down a lap time worthy of the new pro mode. Stay away. Even after they fix it.			",450,43,33,36,33,2,29

												First of all if you think of buying this game : DON'T. Go drink with your friends, do something more productive with the money. At its current state, number of features that have been removed with no prior notice and level of realism its worth no more than 5 euros. I have to say I was expecting way more from F1 2015. I do not have a rig so graphics do not really matter to me. Game play feels much better and more realistic then its predecessors. HOWEVER: No safety car which means that cars disappear from the track after hitting each other or simply continue running like nothing happened. At least a virtual safety car ... but w/e ... features get removed and price goes up ... nothing new.Was it that hard to include a decent physix engine? When i am driving my car and i come in contact with any object i want to see bits and pieces flying based on the speed I have. Currently I am hitting the guard rail at more than 200km/h and nothing close to real happens ( yea I get a puncture, yea my wing gets damaged  but really ... only that at 200km/h?).I am glad that I did not buy the game directly from steam and I only paid 20 euros, which makes this failure a bit easier to swallow.""Thank you"" Codemasters. Last F1 that I am EVER buying.			",52,7,8,7,10,0,8

												First off, This game is good! The main reason for this thumbs down is the error 41 crash that plauges codemasters new games! Same issue that haunts its also excellent dirt rally (still in early access) Until they fix this issue for everyone its a real dealbreaker. These are the only two games i own across two systems that crash out with error 41. When you have races that last as long as these you just cant be putting up with frequent crashing! PLEASE FIX! In terms of graphics i must say their other title Dirt Rally looks way better! To my eyes the main reason is the massively overdone motion blur which softens the life out the visials making the textures looks really poor. You only have to pause it mid race to see just how much detail is actually lost by over use of the motion blur effect. Whats more annoying is the lack of option to turn motion blur off!?! Comon codemasters, i expect way, way more of you. This might be the first of your games i actually ask for my money back for if you dont sort this out quickly!			",45,3,5,1,9,0,0

My Fanactec CSW/CSP worked fine with F1 2014, CSP pedals would not connect. I returned the game after less than an hour, to bad was looking forward to this game.			",95,3,8,6,2,0,0

												Game looks great, but AI is awful. On my first race, I had problems with ALL of the cars I lapped : cars suddenly moving on my trajectory when they appeared to be clearing the way a second before, cars raming me after I overtook them (sometimes with a penalty... for me !), or cars just braking out of nowhere in front of me, on the trajectory. The AI is clearly broken and will ruin the game until it's fixed...			",197,36,20,21,17,6,9

												First of all I would like to say that F1 2015 is a very very messy game by the time of its launch, and it was awful. But now the game recovered and become good again, but, there's still some feature missing, most noticeably is the career mode, we need those we buy f1 games to become another driver, not to control a real driver in a season mode. In the end F1 2015 is good, but compared to previous games it's just stand out crap. I hope F1 2016 will learn from the mistakes of this game			",13,1,3,1,8,0,1

												First of, if the lack of proper career mode and co-op is a big thing for you, you might want to wait for 2016 version.Apart from that the game runs smooth with no major issues for me at all.No crashes, except on the field  :pClosest I've seen to an issue is controller settings reseting once.Some claim to have issues with their wheels but so far I've only played with a controller so can't comment on that.The graphics and driving is great though. 80-100 FPS maxed out with a 970 in 1080P.So if you like F1 and don't mind the lack of career mode, go for it.There is co-op though so you can still play with your friends and I guess keep track yourself.

												Oh boy. This game truly is a legendary rollecoaster of emotions. First off I would like to say that I really, really wanted to play F1 season with proper licensed cars and bought it regardless of the massive amounts of negative feedback, but I should've listened. Damn it, WHY DIDN'T I LISTEN!?It actually played fine for the first couple of hours and I was really getting into it. I liked the handling model and overall look of the game, it looks like a proper racing game. But then I hit China in career and things started to go south real fast. This is the first game that I've actually seen to cause a BLUESCREEN when it burns down to ashes (Windows 8.1 64-bit). And it happens way too frequently! At the moment I am stuck in Bahrain, struggling to finish a 15 lap race which is unacceptable. I don't know if it's my imagination, but it seems car setup goes wrong when you load a game mid-weekend. I can set up a car, qualify it easily to top 10 (expert dif), get bluescreened, reload, go to race and Manors will fly by me during first lap. WTF? And how the F option tires give you greater straight line speed? I dunno, ask Codemasters, they obviously think it's part of the real Formula 1.PROS+Looks decent+Handles well sometimes+Steering wheel actually worked without a hassle (G27)CONS-CRASHES WAY TOO OFTEN-Aggressive and blatantly reckless AI squeezing through a postcard wide cracks-Stupid tire differences-Actually why do I even continue this list, SEE CON #1, it's more than enough of a reason NOT TO BUY this game!Codemasters, I know rushing a game to release in a certain schedule is a thing nowadays but please at LEAST have the decency to FIX YOUR GOD DAMN GAMES post-release.

Smells like an abandoned early access game Year by year, with each release Codemasters removed a tiny bit of content from this series, but this year they did a big leap forward and completely removed everything from the game just because they introduced an all-new engine which has huge compatibility issues with lots of popular game controllers and wheels.

												Ok, first things first.. Since this is my first review and thus have no experience in writing one, I'm still gonna try. I mainly want to review this game because of the havoc it caused on the day of release, and I mean havoc in a bad way...I waited a couple days and finally, after some patches, decided I want to go see and play for myself. And let me get this clear right away, it's a blast!! Compared to the lame AI the previous F1 games from CM suffered with, this one is finally spot on!! I play the game on the hard setting with a xbox 360 controller and all the races I've played so far (I think just 5 of them on 50% race distance) are so much fun! I mean head to head action, racing as Vettel in the Ferrari against Hamilton till the very last round, it never felt so close as I could imagine what would be in real life. Only for that fact alone I enjoyed this game more than all it's predecessors. Off course every now and then you'd come around a (minor) glitch, but the question is if it's ruining the game and the answer too that is most certainly not!! At least not for me. I don't play online, so I can't give you my opinion on that, but if you're here to purely race as one of your favourite drivers and don't mind that there is no formation lap or safety car or other things they could (and should) have implemented in the game, then this is your go! Couple of possitive and negative points about the game (and I always think you should not take in consideration the ones that don't apply to you or what kind of game you're looking for)+ Handling (very well done, has been far worse in the past releases)+ Graphics (simply stunning 1080p ultra settings 60fps on my system)+ Racing experience (fight head to head with your components for multiple laps for the first time in an F1 game from CM)+ 2014 season (included for free)+ Speak with engineer (Very nifty and useful feature)- No career mode (I play championship season and don't mind, but if you want too progress year after year, it's not possible)- No safety car (Bit of a bummer Codies! It's like a soccer game with no refferee :|)- No formation lap (I don't mind, just wanna race, that is where I bought this game for)- Still some bugs (but CM is working very hard too patch them in the near future, am I right? ;) Not a game ruiner for me though)All in all, I defenitly would recommend this game if you're a fan of racing games (F1 in particular off course) and if you've played one of CM earlier F1 games, cause the overall racing experience in combination with the graphics really lift this game to the next level. Hope you'd enjoyed reading this review and made your choice wether too buy this game or not is now a little bit easier ;-)			",5,0,1,0,0,0,0

												Update: There has now been a couple of patches and in fairness this review should be updated. The crashfest which was the released F1 2015 has been fixed and now seems stable. After testing the latest patch (22/7) I did not get any appcrashes or the notorious error 41. The AI has improved (IMHO) and doesn't rear end your car with monotonous frequency. It still happens but mostly as a result of excessively hard braking into a corner. The game still has issues with fault though, expect to be blamed for every collision whether or not you were on line and in front into a corner. Some of the menu operations are awkward such as the car setup ""pad"". Having to type in a save filename everytime gets tedious especially when you just want to update and overwrite an existing setup. I find now the racing pretty enjoyable. I don't have any particular problem with blur (@2560x1440) that some have mentioned and get a solid 60fps on a GTX980ti at absolutely maximum settings. I found the graphics initially appeared washed out with poor contrast which I tweaked up with sweetfx and now looks good to my eye (this may not necessarily be the game but an Nvidia driver issue). There is no sli support as yet. Control options are still very poor. I still can't get my wheel working but have sorted out a decent 360 controller setup after manually editing the file. Value of this F1 2015 over F1 2013 (I've skipped 2014) is debatable. Graphically it is moderately better but other than that losses out in features (and my wheel works in 2013). After the crash fixes I'd recommend it with a few caveats. Original review: This isn't a review of the game but the state of the game. Very, very, broken. You will crash alot but not into other cars, mainly the desktop. Get used to closing the Appcrash error box because you are going to get RSI doing it. In thirty minutes of play, it has crashed every few minutes at many different points; menus, benchmark, in game and even crashes exiting and causes the Steam client to crash with it.Graphically it looks good and runs smoothly but that's where the fun ends. Controller support is broken. Wouldn't recognise my wheel other than as an Xbox controller so it locks me out of wheel setup. Xbox controller support allows remapping of buttons only. No sensitivity, dead zone, gamma etc. Anyway using the controller is like digital steering, you may as well steer with the cursor keys.If the game gets patched up into a reasonable state it maybe OK but as it stands it's just another case of a PC game getting released without any quality control at all.

Installed onto my existing Win7 Desktop machine and the game could not get past the pitlane. since Win10 had just come out, i decided to reinstall my Desktop PC win Win10 and installed steam and the game from scratch - everything working fine, apart from a couple of graphics bugs here and there, but overall, the gameplay itself is spot on. This is without doubt the best F1 Simulator around - i especially like the time trial feature.For those with issues, i know it is difficult (and time consuming) to reinstall a PC, but take advantage that Win10 is out and is an opportunity to start afresh.

												The driving and racing side of F1 2015 is very good.  There is a sence of control that is a level above the previous releases and that is the main thing about a racing game.There are two negatives.  I suspect both are fairly straight forward to address.  The 1st is the online experience in the hoppers is very poor.  The lobby does not tell you what is going on very well.  The countdown to start seems to reset itself.  The vote to skip track countdown replaces the countdown to start, which seems to reset itself again.  The 2nd is GUI elements to navigate the game.  I'm a PC user with a G27 wheel.  On some screens, console buttons (X, B, Y, etc) appear.These are both quality issues rather than gameplay.  The online hopper issue seems to really affect gamers decision whether to stay or leave in my opinion and it feels quite broken from a accessibilty POV.  The GUI navigation issues are presentation issues which do not affect actually navigating through the game.  The standard keyboard controls still work.The single player mode is solid.  The annoying forced learning to control the car from the previous is gone.  I'm personally happy that the career mode is gone.  It wasn't really challenging and was a grind for achievements.  I'm enjoying the handling elements a lot.  The game engine is solid...just remembered 1x game play quirk.  Yellow flag incidents.  ie:  accident happens, you'll hear immediately from your race engineer that the incident is cleared, event before the car has finished spinning.			",19,0,10,0,1,0,0

I play the game on the hard setting with a xbox 360 controller and all the races I've played so far (I think just 5 of them on 50% race distance) are so much fun! I mean head to head action, racing as Vettel in the Ferrari against Hamilton till the very last round, it never felt so close as I could imagine what would be in real life. Only for that fact alone I enjoyed this game more than all it's predecessors. Off course every now and then you'd come around a (minor) glitch, but the question is if it's ruining the game and the answer too that is most certainly not!! At least not for me. I don't play online, so I can't give you my opinion on that, but if you're here to purely race as one of your favourite drivers and don't mind that there is no formation lap or safety car or other things they could (and should) have implemented in the game, then this is your go! Couple of possitive and negative points about the game (and I always think you should not take in consideration the ones that don't apply to you or what kind of game you're looking for)+ Handling (very well done, has been far worse in the past releases)+ Graphics (simply stunning 1080p ultra settings 60fps on my system)+ Racing experience (fight head to head with your components for multiple laps for the first time in an F1 game from CM)+ 2014 season (included for free)+ Speak with engineer (Very nifty and useful feature)- No career mode (I play championship season and don't mind, but if you want too progress year after year, it's not possible)- No safety car (Bit of a bummer Codies! It's like a soccer game with no refferee :|)- No formation lap (I don't mind, just wanna race, that is where I bought this game for)- Still some bugs (but CM is working very hard too patch them in the near future, am I right? ;) Not a game ruiner for me though)All in all, I defenitly would recommend this game if you're a fan of racing games (F1 in particular off course) and if you've played one of CM earlier F1 games, cause the overall racing experience in combination with the graphics really lift this game to the next level. Hope you'd enjoyed reading this review and made your choice wether too buy this game or not is now a little bit easier ;-)			",5,0,1,0,0,0,0

												First and foremost - most of the negativity is people having issues with their various wheels and controllers not working, that is not an active reflection of the game and they should go to Codemasters' blog for a fix, instead of giving the game bad rep. Secondly, there are lots of bugs, yes but the majority of the game-breaking ones are fixed and the game is actually a pleasure to play. I do however hope to see the ones that are in the game still ironed out and I do NOT forgive Codemasters for releasing a broken game. Third, I would like to comment on the gameplay, it is vastly improved on the 2014 game and it feels like a true racing experience and I enjoy the game a lot whether it is online or offline, with or without bugs, as most of the bugs when I'm playing are just hilarious anyway.Fourth, I'm with the whole community when they say they want their REd Flags and their Safety Car back in the game as they made the experience that more real when playing and they are essential in the game, especially where the AI are dumb in Monaco. I'd love to see a parade lap that's toggleable and I'd really enjoy a bump in the difficulty of the game when you're in the better cars on the grid, as it seems a little easy to convert poles into wins on high overtake capacity tracks when you're in cars such as Ferrari and Mercedes. Overall, yes I recommend this game, however make sure that you have a compatable controller or wheel prior to buying it, I use a wireless Xbox 360 controller and some cheap reciever and they're okay. It's fun and if you don't mind waiting for some features or for bugs to be fixed then definitely pick this game up.			",83,9,12,12,12,0,4

You would have thought that CM would have all the bases covered when it came to input devices for F1 2015.  When i was looking for a racing i chose this because it stated that it supports win 10 64bit pc as well as ps3/4. I'd love to comment on the game but sadly i can't, only that it looks quite good visually.   When will the T300 be supported?			",37,0,8,0,0,0,1

												F1 2015 is a nice racing game for huge Formula One Fans just like me or for non Formula One Fans. Of course its not a hardcore racing simulation so dont expect it have nice physics like rFactor 2 for example. But for in between its a nice game, you can have much hours fun in the Singleplayer (Just like me). Also it runs on near Max Settings and high Frames per Second on those (my) PC components:- Intel Core I7 3770K 3,4GHZ- Nvidia GeForce GTX 750Ti 2GB VRAM- 8GB RAM Kingston HyperXSo yeah, this proofs that a GTX 750Ti can run this game on near Max settings @ 60FPS. Because much guys complaining about F1 2015 how bad the Framerates are, how bad it was ported, bla bla.. I dont have Problems with the game, very rare little bugs but they aren't a Fun Killer.The Online Part of F1 2015 is not so good like the Singleplayer, because of different reasons when you play with randoms. (For Example lags, hackers, unfair driving, ramming, etc..)But you can enjoy the Online Part of F1 2015 too if you are just playing with your friend in a private session (1vs1 for example) and with a couple of AI Drivers loaded.So, i definitely recommend to buy F1 2015 for PC.

												After reading all of the reviews I figured I would not buy it. With Steam offering it free to play for a couple of days, I decided to give F1 2015 at try. This version is nothing like F1 2014 or any of the previous versions. They all had a few issues but overall, they worked. I was not even able to get anything to work correctly. Very frustrating. Previously, I was able customize the Logitech G27 but using the ""Customise"" setup here falis. So, bottom line, I am glad Steam offered this chance to test it out. F1 2014 works good on my setup but F1 2015 fails completely. I have to agree with all of the reviews, this version is not worth any efforts. I hope CodeMasters listens to all of the complaints and corrects their thinking going forward. I really want to see them produce a great product.			",5,0,3,0,1,0,0

												I've only just bought this game and I'm loving it. Driving as Jenson Button, I have just completed the Australian GP on full race distance...no frame rate dips whatsoever, a smooth 60fps for 58laps. Handling is so improved and thus helps with consistency. Tyre wear is also more accurate with timely information from your engineer as to the state of your tyres...I got 14 laps out of the 'option' tyres and easily got 18 laps out of the 'prime' tyres before I had to pit. A.I. is more competitive and they make mistakes too...24 race incidents after the Australian GP!The engineer is vastly improved, not only does he give consistent, accurate information on tyre wear, he also informs you of fuel use, weather, lap times and time gaps between your nearest rivals.Graphically, it's an improvement over F1 2014 but it's no real showcase for next generation graphics. Crowd and officials are still oddly static and cardboard like, but that's only seen in the replays. Tracks are nicely detailed and accurate, although I noticed some 'blocky' trees and foliage, and I'm running the game on Ultra High settings.Commentary is limited to before and after the race...it's serviceable, it gets the job done! Replays are better as you can now cycle through all the cars in the race and watch them racing...something Psygnosis could do back in the 90's with their F1 game on PS1...but it's a nice addition. Only wish they would add a UI over the replays that gave you the lap, driver, laptimes etc.I could mention everything that's missing, but I won't because a 100,000 other people have probably already done that across the internet. I love the game so far and it is easily the best F1 game Codemasters have created yet!*Edit...maybe I've been fortunate, but I have encountered no bugs or glitches so far and I have now completed Round 2 The Malaysian GP! My system is high-spec but that wouldn't matter if there were bugs and glitches...I'm sorry for all purchasers who are having issues with the game and I sincerely hope you get them resolved soon!

												I like this game! I realise I'm in the minority here, but if you give me a moment I'll clarify my point of view.First of all, this game is not perfect. It has bugs. It has missing features (you don't have a player career mode, you can't drive as yourself, there are practise sessions still missing). But what it lacks in features it makes up for in the racing. The races are good! Okay, if you drive as Lewis Hamilton, you're quickly going to take the lead and drive away from the pack. But f you choose, say, Button's McLaren or a Sauber, you're going to have a race on your hands to reach your teams goal (which is usually to finish in the top 10).The AI are pretty decent, they will give you a tough fight, they no longer back out of overtaking in the braking zones, and they'll go for small gaps. I've noticed a bug where you're sometimes called into the pits on the same lap as your team mate and have to stack up behind, but it doesn't happen all the time. And you can get around it by pitting a lap later.Weather modelling is about the same as always, so no problems there.The damage could do with being a bit more sensitive. I crashed into a driver who braked suddenly in front of me, and I suffered no damage even with full damage enabled. Front wings need to be more fragile.Aside from these problems, which are easy enough to work around, it's a good game. Is it the best F1 game ever? No, not by a long shot. But it's OK.Don't expect too much. Go into it expecing a no frill, no nonsense F1 racing game. It's not a full on sim, but it's not an arcade game either.			",84,29,8,21,37,1,32

												Bought game. Enjoyed game besides some bugs like the game changing its resolution on its own or being crashed by my teammate in pit. Happy about getting a quick patch. Realized the patch made the car not possible to steer anymore. Had to wait for another patch, which suddenly made the car brake whenever I tried to accelerate.And what happened since then? No progress for several months (now I cannot gear up and change the camera whenever I gear down and the game still crashes when I use instant replay), instead I get the message that my controller's not supported.

Career mode is gone, chosing qualy and race is gone, the AI raises questions, key bindings are just randomly placed and this list goes on. I really hope a very big patch is coming.

What have I  done to try to fix the problem?Given that I earlier reported some issues on DiRT Rally too, I wanted to check my system first.Since that other bug report of mine, I've reinstalled Windows, made sure no other major processes were running in the background (Other than Steam)I've opened up my PC case and cleaned it of any dust (There wasn't much, which wasn't a suprise considering it's not even a year old and well-maintained)I've kept an eye on the PC temperatures while playing several games, it never reaches oddly high temperatures (Never above 60 degrees celcius in GTA V on pretty high settings, for example)I have turned down the graphics settings and ran without V-sync to test it.I've checked whether there was a driver update avaliable for my PC. There wasn't.How long was your current session?I've had several sessions. Some were short, with me going in the menu and starting the benchmark straight away. Also I've tried running a 100% race weekend, which I ran till about 50% of the race and saved there because the issues were really annoying me.			",8,0,1,0,1,0,0

I'm running an intel i7 and GTX980 and everything appears to be fine for me personally.This however does not excuse the fact that clearly, the game does not run well (or at all) for the majority of people which is inexcusable. The game should work everywhere and should give the same experience (or very similar) on most hardware.I have however myself also seen very minor things/glitches with my Intel/Nvidia setup, Hopefully for those having these issues, things get resolved promptly.The Graphics looks amzing though.Even though the game runs mostly fine on my setup, it just seems to be lacking and on top of that because of all the issues that the majority of people seem to be having, I unfortunately cannot give this game a thumbs up.

												Took advantage of the free weekend to give this a go and purchased it after being stunned by the lovely looks, playability and stunning replays, this game is awesome and easily my new favourite racer and bearing in mind I have the likes of P-Cars and Assetto Corsa I just didn't think this would touch em but my god was I pleasantly surprised, really feels like a formula one drive. It does have one or two issues though like some of the replays on certain tracks the sound is very quiet and you don't get the roar of the engines as you do on other tracks, secondly, some close ups of the spectators and pit peoples faces aren't up to scratch but this is really nit picking and doesn't distract from the awesome gamplay and feeling your actually taking part in a formula one race.

												This is a truly amazing F1 game but lacks a lot of game modes. The car physics feel fantastic and the force feedback is great. You can really feel the bumps and speed thanks to the improved soundtrack and new engine which makes it feel and look like a totally different game to F1 2014. Graphics have been greatly improved and I can run it at a smooth 60fps maxed out at 1440p with gtx 780 SLI (Not sure if SLI profile is out yet). The AI feel more challenging on higher difficulties and use the track to how I watch F1 on TV. The new weather conditions look amazing and really change the way you have to drive compared to last years game and most of the tracks look great as well. Stormy weather conditions look photorealistic especially on the Singapor track. I want to mention that there are no safety cars in the game and I have no idea why. Also the hit collision is so bad you can get away with pretty much anything (hopefully a mod will come out to fix that just like F1 2014)Pros: Greatly Improved physics          Greatly improved graphics (adds immersion especially with the soundtrack ingame)         Realistic AI          performance is good (While I cannot play in 4K as I get around 40fps I am waiting for an SLI profile to fix that and there is a benchmark you can loop to see performance like F1 2014)         Can choose to race in 2014 cars and season and 2015 cars and season         Amazing weather conditions (graphically and gameplay wise)cons: No career mode          Cannot foward time in practice or qualifiying quick enough           Can be demanding if you have a lower spec machine (Lots of graphics options to tweak though)          Graphics are great comparing to F1 2014 but not the best compared to the newest racing games like project carsMinimal style TV intro with commentary which could have been much more as it lasts for like 10 seconds.No safety cars Bad hit collision and damage If you love F1 games or have an interest in F1 I would recommend this game only if you have a good spec machine, dont mind some of the missing game modes and enjoy racing games.

												This game is actually more fun than previous F1 2014 and here my reasons :Much better and more aggressive AI sometimes even too aggressive (made me crash 2 times after overtake they wouldnt leave too much space).Ai now has more B*LLS to overtake.I dont miss carreer mode since i hated that when i change time from Ferrari to Mercedes (Hamilton or Rosberg would disaper) i would like to see like transfer system so other drivers could change teams too.I dont miss safety car there wasnt too much its activity on F1 2014 either execpt for Monaco i guess.Car feels so much better than previous games i play on keyboard still so its kinda of improvment for me .When traction control is off on keyboard i couldnt handle the car it was spinning i guess i need to get more feel to it .Now graphics :I have I5 and GTX 750 and i have solid 60FPS on 1080p ultra settings which is enough for me BUTenvironment looks extremly bad its all pixleted. Even other cars looks bad . I hope they will fix this somehow.I am very big fun of F1 and F1 games and i really hope they will do something about PC version.I wont give up !  ",39,2,9,3,6,0,4

												Seems like most people are complaining about buggy menus and bad graphics. I bought this game so I could race, not menu hop, and Codemasters has created a good racing game. I want to say it's the best version they've come out with in terms of accuracy, feel, and realism. I thought I wouldn't like that they got rid of ""Career"" mode, but honestly the only difference is you cannot name your character, big woop. (Oh and they got rid of the beginner driving thing at the start, this is a positive). My only two complaints I have and they are pretty nitpicky, I was hoping for formation laps and manual pitting (instead of auto piloting to your crew). But then I realized (especially in multiplayer) people would fail to land on their real position on the grid, or run over their pit crew, and complain about that instead of setting up their graphics wrong.Overall, great game, pro season is awesome. Very tough (What I want). I'm still on Autrailia P1 trying to get within 5 seconds of hamilton			",44,2,3,3,2,0,3

												Sat waiting for the game to start.Soon as I did I had to set the display up so thought run a benchmark to get the best graphics for my system.4 attempts later stil havent got a completed benchmark.Just done a basic race and the game is good but many flaws in it so far,No driving out of the pits manualy its all computer.no prade lap,No safety car big dissapointment. Ai not the best some strange mistakes. Also car in front blew his engine very poor effects and then turned into a see through car and took me off in to a wall I broke my endplate and was retired due to car been too badly damaged.Video replay looked like i had a giant sparkler as a car . Smoke blowing out with millions of sparks.These are what are needed on the first patch1. Better Ai2. Safety Car3. Drive out of pits manualy4. Drive into pits and be able to activate pit limiter manualy too early u lose time too late you get speeding in the pit lane.5. more realistic damage at moment looks like we gone back in time on the damage model.6.

												Positively, do not buy.The game crashes constantly,the optimalization is ♥♥♥♥. (My specs are more than 100% more powerful than minimum and I still have to use the lowest settings in order to get 30 fps.)Then, even though my wheel is a supported wheel, it does not work correctly in any way, shape or form.It took me half an hour of tweaking before I could get the throttle pedal to work.The wheel keeps pulling to the left and the force feedback only works half of the time.Not to mention that the game randomly freezes my inputs in the middle of races.♥♥♥♥ Codemasters.Please do not buy this game, pre-ordering this was a huge mistake.

												Many users are slating the gameplay as they have had the luxury of even being able to get off the grid. Upon starting the race i put full power on the throttle and the back wheels spin ferociously, mean while the car does not move an inch and i cannot even drive the car. I use the xbox 360 game pad for windows im not sure if this is a consistant bug with all controller users but in any case a bug like that is unacceptable and cannot be present in a new game, riduculous! im so disappointed with this as I am a massive fan of Formula 1 and its game franchise which has been able to entertain me since 2011.

												So, I think that I should leave positive feedback. Yep, because it's not so bad as described.Yes, this is was a mistake to release F1 2015 in early year. Otherwise, it would be possible to eliminate interface (control) errors. Then the game would received more positive reviews.It lacks a career mode that allows you to transition out of 14th year season to 15th. And I'm not talking about a career in which for example for Williams can fight some ""W0menLorD2003"". No, because a real pilot has certain sponsors. Needless to talk about PDVSA, etc. With the current system of licensed pilots, it looks more realistic, and I like it.Fiddled with software of my device, I was able to achieve good handling. I want to note that driving in 2015th game is more Interesting and complicated than in F1 2014. This is a big step forward.Of course, the graphics has become better. I like colors in F1 2015, but, of course, blur spoil all the experience. And modes do not fix it to the full. Here's another example of the console port. :\ However, I liked the game menu and its ""soundtrack"". Many are dissatisfied with the lack of alcohol logos. Yes, like others, I want to see Martini logos on FW36 and 37 and in the team name. But have you ever thought about game's age rating? As I recall, the rating increase is costly. And this applies to all genre of games.Another blunder is a SC, of course. I don't know why it was deleted. Sad, but true.Unfortunately, I did not see the manifestation of the great thinking of AI cars. AI became more agressive and only. But it can talk about my lack of experience.At the same time the game has become more lively due to the staff, commentators, etc. Not as much as it could, but it looks more advantageous against the background of the 13th and 14th F1.This is not the last game in the series, and devs have something to strive for. Taking into account its current mistakes, they are able to make a truly worthy project. Just take your job seriously, guys.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I think so far the best F1 Game from Codemasters.Obviously it has still some few bugs and glitches but after several pathes it becomes better.I really enjoy to play this game because of the graphics and the realistic physics. Here my Pro's and Contras's to this game:Pros:- Realistic physics - Awesome graphics (weather, atmosphere, cars, track etc.)- Championship Mode is amazing- AI finally more aggressive and competitive (also at the start of a race)- Racing is quite realistic- Podiums celebrations with chamagne after the race (when you finish in top 3 obviously)- Cars are faster than 2014- Nice engine sounds (better than in F12014)Contras:- No Safety Car (I hope it will come ou a patch for that)- Multiplayer sometimes terrible- No Career Mode with your own name/driver (But Championship Mode is also cool)- No Sceanario Mode- The bonus feature is not really serious (I mean the 2014 season os not a real bounus content)			",8,0,4,0,0,0,0

												I feel the game is now at a point where it is actually worth looking at. The launch was terrible and I am glad the reviews were bad and Codemasters lost money. There is no excuse for that garbage they put out earlier this year. But after ~10 patches the game is finally good.The good:- Graphics are beautiful and performance is fine- The AI is fantastic- The handling is better and doesn't feel like you are driving on rails- Actual performance differences between the cars - you won't be able to win with a Honda- More management from the driver is needed during the race (tyres, fuel, engine, brakes,...)- Dynamic weather- Great presentation and feel- Includes 2014 and 2015 season (which means we get Hockenheim)- FOV settingsThe bad:- Multiplayer is a cluster♥♥♥♥ and not enjoyable- Some things feel scripted and not simulatedVerdict:It is in my opinion the best F1 game we've had in years. It took a while to get here but it is an absolute cracker. The new AI and better handling make it feel like it is a totally new game (which is most likely is). Love it.			",149,29,23,21,44,2,17

												I'm really not quite sure how I feel about 2015 yet.  The car handling is the worst in the series.  Even by editing advanced wheel settings, the car still feels far too twitchy and unresponsive.  The AI bumps and bangs far too much and having not used Instant Replay much in the past, I now have to use it to prevent silly penalties imposed on me when the AI bump me from behind.  I cannot recommend this game at the moment, but will update this review once issues are resolved.			",114,20,56,12,19,4,8

												As a gamepad user, this has the best controls on a Codies F1 game yet - FAR ahead of both 2013 and 2014Outside of the controls, the AI is better (it doesn't give-up places even on lower difficulties) and the track bounds are tougher on corner-cutters which is long overdue.  The cars also seem to model aero better, you can feel the car digging-into fast turns and being committed matters more than it did in earlier gamesTrail braking (braking into a corner) is punished more now - you need to be tidier, you can't save your mistakes so easily!!Graphics are certainly more detailed but they're also pretty demanding - i5 4440/650 Ti Boost sees 45-60fps on med/high settings which isn't brilliant but isn't as bad as it sounds/is perfectly playable (and lowering settings doesn't really improve fps numbers anyway)An outstanding bug seems to be your own engine being too quiet (other cars actually drown it out in all but cockpit view) but that's teaching me to look at the revcounter instead of trusting my ears (these hybrids aren't really designed to be revved-out to the limiter anyway)I did have a couple of crashes (to desktop that is!!) but a ""Verify Game Files"" sorted those out.I don't really play online so I can't comment on that I'm happy tho - as a pad player, it's the best F1 'drive' yet.

												Pwah, PUT YER READING GLASSES ON! I'm delivering an indepth review. Ok where do I start. I've followed Codies ever since Colin McRae Rally 2.0 (as stated in my previous reviews for Codies games) as an avid racer I couldn't wait to see what they could do with their first Next Gen release for Formula One. Well for a start I can see a repeat of their first series into the F1 Franchise with F1 2010. No safety car, non-dynamic weather, average AI. But that slowly built up as the sequals were released so I am hoping next years game will be more feature full. Focusing on this game. F1 2015 brings the 2015 season and the 2014 season into one package for the next gen consoles. GRAPHICS: The engine has been rebuilt (so they say) and everything has been reworked. The game looks and feels great, running at 60fps at 1080p on both my laptop, and my PS4 and looks absolutely stunning. The game looks its best in the wet weather where the detail is immense!HANDLING: The handling of the game has been reworked so the car feels more realistic but I feel the car is almost way to easy to stop under braking. It feels like ABS is always on, even though I don't use the Driving Aids. Wet weather conditions will make any racer nervous to stray off the racing line to attack, as you will most likely end up in the gravel.DAMAGE: This is one big letdown. The damage model of the car is virtually unchanged, while it may be easier to clip your front wing, its taken a backwards step compared to other games like Project Cars, rFactor 2, Asseto Corsa. Even their own DIRT Rally has a better damage model and it was released before F1 2015. There seem to be NO MECHANICAL FAILURES, like brakes, ERS failure, flat spots and the only time i get a puncture is if I deliberatly punt the car into the wall hard enough.AI: The AI have been reworked as well, I play on legendary settings and they seem to manage their tyres better while still keeping up with me, often performing better. I tried some tyre savings but dropped off the pace, may have to change my tactics. AI like to make mistakes, sometimes clashing with each other and losing a front wing but nothing special compared to f1 2013. Another thing is if an AI hit you (yes HIT YOU) they tend to push your car into the wall, or spin you, while they continue as if there was no contact.REPLAYS/FLASHBACKS: Replays now allow you to see the action from not just your car, but any car you wish so you can see just how awesome that crash was. However the replays are slighty broken as once you perform a flashback you cant go back and rewind further. This made me lose a race as while overtaking a backmarker on the last lap I got hit and spun into a wall, as I used a flashback I hit the button too late and it flashbacked to after the spin and was unable to use the feature again to get out of it.SETUPS: Setups are ok, a few nicks from me, I cannot change a setup during a quick race with no practice and no qualifying. Or if it rains while the qualifying was dry on low downforce packs the AI seem to have a leading edge in the rain, almost like their setup changed. Funny that.In closing the game is the start of new things to come, it has bugs, its not feature full but its a good start of the Next Gen series. Compared to Dirt Rally (the sister game released prior) it feels like the F1 games don't get the development they need to be a great game for racers and feels unfinished. I still recommend this game however. ",82,14,12,8,14,1,4

												Pwah, PUT YER READING GLASSES ON! I'm delivering an indepth review. Ok where do I start. I've followed Codies ever since Colin McRae Rally 2.0 (as stated in my previous reviews for Codies games) as an avid racer I couldn't wait to see what they could do with their first Next Gen release for Formula One. Well for a start I can see a repeat of their first series into the F1 Franchise with F1 2010. No safety car, non-dynamic weather, average AI. But that slowly built up as the sequals were released so I am hoping next years game will be more feature full. Focusing on this game. F1 2015 brings the 2015 season and the 2014 season into one package for the next gen consoles. GRAPHICS: The engine has been rebuilt (so they say) and everything has been reworked. The game looks and feels great, running at 60fps at 1080p on both my laptop, and my PS4 and looks absolutely stunning. The game looks its best in the wet weather where the detail is immense!HANDLING: The handling of the game has been reworked so the car feels more realistic but I feel the car is almost way to easy to stop under braking. It feels like ABS is always on, even though I don't use the Driving Aids. Wet weather conditions will make any racer nervous to stray off the racing line to attack, as you will most likely end up in the gravel.DAMAGE: This is one big letdown. The damage model of the car is virtually unchanged, while it may be easier to clip your front wing, its taken a backwards step compared to other games like Project Cars, rFactor 2, Asseto Corsa. Even their own DIRT Rally has a better damage model and it was released before F1 2015. There seem to be NO MECHANICAL FAILURES, like brakes, ERS failure, flat spots and the only time i get a puncture is if I deliberatly punt the car into the wall hard enough.AI: The AI have been reworked as well, I play on legendary settings and they seem to manage their tyres better while still keeping up with me, often performing better. I tried some tyre savings but dropped off the pace, may have to change my tactics. AI like to make mistakes, sometimes clashing with each other and losing a front wing but nothing special compared to f1 2013. Another thing is if an AI hit you (yes HIT YOU) they tend to push your car into the wall, or spin you, while they continue as if there was no contact.REPLAYS/FLASHBACKS: Replays now allow you to see the action from not just your car, but any car you wish so you can see just how awesome that crash was. However the replays are slighty broken as once you perform a flashback you cant go back and rewind further. This made me lose a race as while overtaking a backmarker on the last lap I got hit and spun into a wall, as I used a flashback I hit the button too late and it flashbacked to after the spin and was unable to use the feature again to get out of it.SETUPS: Setups are ok, a few nicks from me, I cannot change a setup during a quick race with no practice and no qualifying.

												After sometime of this game being out I can finally say it is fixed and running perfect on my computer with no issues what so ever and they have also added an ultra high setting as well so the game looks even better than it did on release. The game is now one of the best f1 games I have played and it is now perfect due to the new update. however the lack of a saftey car takes away from the game but hopefully codemaster will keep updating this game now that they have fixed all the bugs, 8/10			",33,1,8,0,5,0,0

												Τα βήματα που γίνανε προς τη σωστή κατεύθυνση είναι πολλά κι ορισμένα εξ’ αυτών πολύ σημαντικά. Αν η Codemasters δε προβεί σε νέους πειραματισμούς στους τομείς που διόρθωσε, αποφασίσει να λύσει κάποια άλλα προβλήματα που είναι χρόνια και ταυτόχρονα κατανοήσει ότι το έξτρα περιεχόμενο που έχει απ’ την εποχή F1 2010-F1 2014  (Career mode, Practice objectives, Classic mode, Diamond races, Champions mode, αλλά και οι προηγούμενες πίστες  σε Hockenheim, Valencia, Nurburgring, India, Korea, Instanbul) πρέπει να επιστρέψει στο παιχνίδι, έχει τα φόντα να μας δώσει του χρόνου έναν πλήρη εξομοιωτή F1. Μέχρι τότε το F1 2015 θα συντηρεί τις ελπίδες μας για κάτι τέτοιο, όντας ένα σημαντικά βελτιωμένο κεφάλαιο της σειράς.The visual and driving improvements, compared to F1 2014, are more than obvious, but the game still lacks some crucial aspects, such as safety car, smart penalty system and more aggressive and intelligent behaviour for drivers controlled by CPU. Also, all the content and the ideas that Codemasters already has in its hands from previous instalments (Career mode, Practice objectives, Classic mode, Diamond races, Champions mode and previous circuits, such as Hockenheim, Valencia, Nurburgring, India, Korea, Instanbul) must make their return in F1 2016.http://ragequit.gr/reviews/item/f1-2015-pc-reviewIf somebody from Codemasters is reading this, I would personally suggest the following changes in F1 2016:- Return of all modes I mentioned above- Return of all circuits I mentioned above, in one more special mode- Further improvement of the penalty system, especially regarding corner cutting- Enhanced possibility of mechanical failures or tyre punctures - Safety car and red flags please!- Better drivers' A.I, with more aggressive behaviour- Fixes on various smaller problems and lacks, such as the inability to change to option or prime tyres when rain stops during qualifying, better replay menus and controls, existence of a race calendar containing results from each race, fix on framedrops during Monza race- Instant ban to people behaving unacceptably in online multiplayer mode  I believe if you make all these changes in F1 2016, it will be truly epic!

												After a bad start when F1 2015 was released, i genuinely thought i'd wasted my money getting the game. Now though, after all mthe updates that have been implemented to the game, my perspective has completely changed. More challenging, realistic, fun and competitive compared to the previous F1 releases. Codemasters had done a fantastic job with f1 2010 through to 2013, 2014 let them down a bit as the final game appeared to be just a car/sound update of 2013. There are still areas of the game that need improving: parc ferme needs fixing so that tyres used in Q2 are locked for the race start unless its alternate weather, own use of ERS was promised by codies but so far hasn't appeared. Also, multiplayer still doesn't support a full compliment of 20 human racers, still the 16 from the previous titles.Lets hope Codies can improve upon the current situation, but overall a good start for their first next gen F1 project.Rating 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't know what has happened to this game.  I used to love racing in this series, but it is not possible to race without someone taking you off the track from the rear.  It's like no one in F1 can overtake without barging you out of the way.  It would be something if the flashback system was usable, but in five years of Codemastyers F1 games, I've never got that to work.  Graphics and other driving physics are great though.

												I really love racing sim and I was really excited about this free weekend...Unfortunately this game is sort of broken and that ruins what could be really awesome.+ Great physics, feels really nice. Although I've never driven an F1 car I'd say it feels pretty ""realistic""+ Graphics are pretty good+ Easy to turn all assists off and jump into sim mode really quickly- Draw distance on mirrors is abyssmal- Volume is far to loud even on lowest- Hard and higher difficulty A.I. will literally PLOW YOU OUT OF THE WAY ruining the game at these levels- You get penalties for any collisions even if the A.I. are completely at fault for the accident (I.E. plowing you out of the way from behind)- Performance is TERRIBLE. i5-3450 + GTX 960 4GB + 12GB of RAM on my system, and this game runs at 45fps most of the time on highest settings (1080p), comparatively Dirt Rally looks better and runs at 80 at max settings/1080p.Twenty dollars is far too much for this, maybe ten if it really goes on sale would be worth it, nothing more.

												A very steady platform to build upon. Championship mode is good for the first season but has abosultely no replayability. Multiplayer is a shambles as there are glitches and game breaking problems eveywhere. However, as with any game if you have a good group of friends to play with then it is all fun. Even in qualifying if you cut and extend the track your time is still accepted...Time trial is decent but allows you to extend on some tracks (especially Cota USA) causing it to be unrealiable.Overall i recommend this game as it is a decent platform and the handling model of the cars is good.7/10			",23,3,12,0,13,0,4

												Wheel support is just terrible! So if you're planning to play this game with a wheel, you probably better off skipping this one. I'm using a Logitech |G25, maybe other wheels work better...? First of all, degrees of rotation is screwed up. If you set it to 900, it just doesn't make sense at all. It isn't one to one. At the moment I'm using 360 and it's not perfect, but sort of okay. Then about that force feedback, it's just terrible again. It just doesn't communicate what the car is doing and just feel terrible and  no road. how am I suppose to race with that?!?

												I bought this racing sim/game recently and love it.  I'm only about 7-hours into it, but wow, great job with this release.  I just ignored all the negative reviews and jumped right in, knowing most of the negatives were prior to the many patches and fixes. My intorduction to 2015 was after all the new release hoopla and problems (just purchased 01/30/2016), and long after the patches and bug fixes were released, so I do not and have not suffered from all the issues you see in reviews that are 1-6 months old.   Also it's smooth as silk running at max settings with 1920x1080 resolution AMD 8320 8-core.  I have 2014 as well and have fully enjoyed that on the PS3 and also just bought it for my PC, adding some nice graphic mods - 2014 is great looking in it's own right but with the new visual mods it's fantastic and with very cool game play options.  With that said, 2015 looks a little better but not a huge leap from 2014 imo, especially with visual mods added to 2014 - but 2015 looks better non-the-less unmoddd thus far.  The one thing is I don't see MSAA antialiasing, which is weird that 2015 wouldn't have that setting.Now the car and handling are much improved (ie harder to drive) with much better physics over 2014.  Need a very light touch on throttle and brakes or you'll feel like your driving on an ice rink (I only use medium TC assist, nothing else).  You have to finess the car handling and acceleration if you want to keep from crashing.  The first impression is the very real sensation and ""feel"" of driving the real thing; a highly unstable and fast F-1 racer - much much moreso than 2014.  After driving 2015 for a several hours with practice laps/time trials, I jumped into 2014 and with all assists off it was almost easy and a little ""rail like"".  After all the difficulty I have with pushing the new 2015 platform it makes jumping into 2014 a much easier drive.  The actual feeling of driving in 2015 is there in all it's glory, muchmoreso than 2014, and '14 is no slouch imo (I know the iRacing guys will probably laugh).  So I'll do most of my heavy practicing in 2015 and use 2014 to race online and for it's neat carreer mode and vintage racers.  And the audio in 2015....wow, that is something I noticed immediatly...so much fuller, louder, rich and deep.  The car and engine audio is leaps and bounds above 2014, very immersive.  The car, it simply screams!!I've not done any career races or online racing yet in 2015, so not sure about the AI or how well career mode is.  I do know you drive as a real driver, not as yourself, which is odd to me.  The career mode in 2014 is pretty cool, you get to do well and sign with better teams.  Not so with 2015 which is a dissapointment - oh well.  As for multiplayer, I guess there are still issues with the netcode for 2015 so it seems as of right now most of the online F1 leagues are racing with 2014 until Codeies fix 2015 multiplayer - hopefully soon.All in all I'm loving it so far.  Not that deep into it yet, but I'm working on it.  I'd definately recomend it.  I just don't see where all the hate is coming from as I don't see anything that would merit it at all in its current state.  I assume alot of it comes from the pre patch versions, but who knows.  Expectations can get out of control I guess.EDIT:  Oh, one thing - no trackIR support for 2015 far as I can tell.  It works for 2014, but can't get it to function in 2015.  My $.02 worth!

												F1 2015 is not a really bad game. It's not even quite a bad game, it's just I'm not going to touch it for a couple years from now at least most likely and despite the price tag being still the original, it gets eclipsed by F1 2015 in pretty much every single way. If you bought it in the year it came out, then good on you, I'd say it'd only be a waste of your money if you bought it non-sale and a more than a month after release. Now, if you don't have it, only buy it if we're 3+ years in the future and it costs a fiver or less in the sales.It's not even any easier to run than F1 2016 in my experience at least.Pros:Realistic and rewarding handling modelGreat graphicsGood AIDebutised the pleasant 'broadcast presentation' and podiumsCons:Glitchy (Not so much now, but it was basically a techdemo on release)Impossible to be smooth on a padFacesOnline system (a mess of hoppers)Online lagThings it does better than it's little brother:Handling model questionably (but they are rather similiar in truth)Overall, my opinion is, BUY IT when it's really cheap, but there's no point at this moment in getting it.

Tried to use the default Xbox 360 setup no luck still impossible.  Have not had one successful startup and I was just practicing.

												Five races into the season and this game is absolutely boring. It's repetitive as any racing game but it offers no incentive to play any further. Why play another 4 hours just to see 20 seconds of a ""you won the championship"" movie? You can fail objectives without punishment. The animations after sessions are always the same and though the in game models are nicely modeled, the menu pictures of drivers and cars are just heinous.The real gameplay is a conundrum: dynamic weather, flag rules, different performances all make for a great set up but driving feels wooden (especially on straights). I played without assistances (other than race line) and it doesn't take too long for you to master your car and catch Hamilton in every darn race. Different modes? You can play your usual short races through a season or go for the PRO SEASON (full length). Quick race, time trial, multiplayer. No legends, no career mode....It's no arcady enough for people who just want to hold the acceleration button down and it's too daft and simple for people who want a racing game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First F1 game i have purchased since geoff crammonds grand prix on Amiga.I bought this without reading reviews on strength of Dirt Rally performance on my PC.7850k and R9 280 16gig2133 ram.Avg more 60fps with good settings.Handles great ;really nice driving physics,proper good feedback .Wheel works fantastic.Looks great,honestly,i thought Dirt Rally was sexy;this is smashing.Great camera adjustment POV also adjustable.AI drivers just a bit annoying,just now and again you get rear ended by the ai,sometimes you see em,sometimes you dont.Not a game breaker for me;I'm sure Codemasters will tweak it.Sound is also very good,i use a sound card by creative,which helps to not hog the cpu with extra work.So smashing performance on my modest machine.Not crashed or locked up once.I like it,going to give some time up for it.Well i would if elite dangerous had not got its claws in me at the mo.

												This came out with tons of bug, so I waited and bought it on a sale after a few patches. Now I must say the game runs like a charm in my system, I've found zero bugs.I run it on a i5 4440 with a 970GTX, 8GB of RAM, a SSD, Windows 10 and a 360 controller. Never had a crash, fps tank, controller issue or any other bug. Runs well and always at 60fps.The game is great. Good graphics and amazing AI. Good balance between arcade and simulator. For me is the most engaging racing game that I've tried, I love it.The damage system is pretty basic, and there is no safety car :( which it's my main concern with the game. There is no career mode, and while I miss that it's not the end of the world. They say the multiplayer is a mess, I don't know, never tried it. I'm always racing the AI.If you buy this game try it right away, in case you find bugs or issues and need to ask for a refund. But if you're lucky and the game runs well, then you'll find it worthy of your money.			",166,147,17,13,28,4,36

												Five races into the season and this game is absolutely boring. It's repetitive as any racing game but it offers no incentive to play any further. Why play another 4 hours just to see 20 seconds of a ""you won the championship"" movie? You can fail objectives without punishment. The animations after sessions are always the same and though the in game models are nicely modeled, the menu pictures of drivers and cars are just heinous.The real gameplay is a conundrum: dynamic weather, flag rules, different performances all make for a great set up but driving feels wooden (especially on straights). I played without assistances (other than race line) and it doesn't take too long for you to master your car and catch Hamilton in every darn race. Different modes? You can play your usual short races through a season or go for the PRO SEASON (full length). Quick race, time trial, multiplayer. No legends, no career mode....It's no arcady enough for people who just want to hold the acceleration button down and it's too daft and simple for people who want a racing game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												F1 2015 is a great F1 game but it needs sometime to fix it's crashes & gliches but atleast it runs great with all of my hardware. As of gameplay standpoint there is alot of changes like no career mode what is sad & the only  modes are ""Championchip mode"" what is just pick a team & driver, 5 race defaults (no customation of the race settings & hit the track, the other mode is ""Pro Season"" is just A full SIM Mode so if you are very good with driving go for it. As for the AI they are so much ""lifely"" & racing is so much better then before. btw is a switch for 2014 season mode as well, kinda cool addon, I quess. For those who enjoyed the online CO-OP, I am afraid there isn't the option to do that anymore but even if there was a online CO-OP your time with it probably would not be that cool with the onlines ""netcode"" atm.For the driving they have changed the pad turning ""reaction"" so you need to get a new grip for that if you are a pad user, the backend is pretty lose if you aren't carefull with your throttle & brakes are lot more realistic, I had to change almost all of my breaking points.  Conclusion:Wait if you aren't so big into F1 games but still wan't to play them for those who love F1 games go for it if you can life without a career mode and online is what it is. Force feedback is okey with me, not the best but ain't the worst either (G25). Good:Better grafics, The scenery behind tracks IS SO MUCH BETTERBetter Physics (with some funky crashes)Better replay systemBetter AITwo season's 2014 & 2015TV format (I like it)The Bad:Crashes & alot of gliches (prob going to be resolved)No career modeNo CO-OPOnline is still has same problems as older F1 gamesSC or VSC not present			",193,8,22,13,23,0,32

												Its not a bad game but it has problems:Its too difficult for casual play - cars speed away from you even on very easy setting. And this is ona  straight so its no reflection of the quality of the driving. There no way they should do that on an easy setting.Controller setting are minimal. Its ok if you have an 'advanced wheel' (whatever one of those is) but I have a joystick and you cant config it at all. No sensitivity settings for travelling at speed so you waver all over the track. Plus the game when I played it kept losing my controller settings every time I restarted. Also when I set the controller to joystick I couldnt use Esc to exit a session the only way to get out of a session was to stop on a racetrack and get black listed! You cant even exit from the pits. Terrible settings, terrible configuration.The car AI is abysmal. They dont go around you they barge you off the track every time. Otherwise its not a bad game, graphics are good, I had no crashes in the short time I was trying the game, pits looked good, communications with the team were really good. And of course this is probably the only game where you can play the current season without mods. In the end I used Steam refund policy to try the game and ended up getting a refund and bought Project Cars which is a far far far better game all around. But even rFactor2 is better than this game in terms of options, immersion, AI and driving experience.			",35,1,2,5,22,0,20

												In 2010 I bought a new computer with the latest in graphics  and audio specifically to play the F1 series. In 2011 the update was so much more in terms of computer requirements that I fried that year old video card. Spent $500 on a new one. The next updates all worked fine through 2014.Now this. I can't even get my system to open a quick race. I am not upgrading this system again. I would like a refund!			",1,0,10,0,0,0,0

												Ok so having played 31 hours of this game since its release I have come to the conclusion that it is ♥♥♥♥♥.The graphics are below par and not what codies promised.The ai are useless always crashing into you/ glitchingThe online gameplay is horendous constant lagging, of ai and other players even with a ping of 18ms The only part of this game i can compliment is the physics engine which is actually alright unfortunately its let down by every other aspect.

												Compared to the latest F1 games, the F1 2015 Game is a lot better. It became a lot better, both in Graphics, and Gameplay.In other hand, I think this is not enough nowdays. They should improve the features such as: Safety Car, Engine & other car failures, etc..			",45,9,7,5,3,0,4

												Great game! :) f1 2013 was gr8, f1 2014 was better, f1 2015 is much better than both. Action, race fever/ flair, realistic, awesome graphics and sequences. Only a few corrections needed, but thats ok and normal. Great job done on this game :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
