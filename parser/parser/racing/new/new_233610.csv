								This game is great, just get it. But listen to what i have to say!FOR EPILEPTIC PEOPLE in the level editor i found i rare bug where the screen does basically the most sure thing to trigger an epileptic seizure. The entire screen just flashes at varieing speeds with random colors and shapes. DO NOT USE IF YOU HAVE A HISTORY OF EPILEPTIC SEZUIRES.

								[Review date: Dec. 2nd, 2014; one week before Early Access][Edited on March 16th, 2015]Alpha Backer hereFirst and foremost: For a title that just now hits Early Access the game is working surprisingly well. The implemented gamemodes work, offline and online Multiplayer works, leaderboards and steam workshop work too :3+ postive- negativeo neither, but wanted to mentionGameplay / Controls+ Car controls nicely+ Lots of obstacles to avoid. Placement of obstacles can make for great flow in levels, ranging from hectic dodging to smooth precision driving.+ Getting cut to pieces by lasers does not kill you. Instead it chops off a piece of your car, and you can continue with a few missing wheels, greatly impacting the car controls.+ Flying and rotational jets allow for a great amount of agility. It feels badass to just throw in a random backflip.+ Possible overheat from boosting too much keeps player on his toes. The best players will find ways to boost for entire levels by utilizing the stunt-system for heat-management.+ Checkpoints are optional, allowing for offroad search for crazy shortcuts.+ Sprint and Challenge gamemodes require a surprisingly different approach, making for nice variety.o No AI vehicles, but to be honest who would expect that with such a powerfull level editor.- Main menu does not react to mouse input at all. Only part of the game that accepts mouse input is the Level Editor.- No way of saving ghosts or up/downloading replays. All that gets saved is the time / points (depending on gamemode) you got on the track. (Devs plan to implement this)- Game's physics are tied to the FPS, resulting in inconsistent physics below 60 frames per second. Can rarely cause going straight through solid objects unharmed or blowing up on steep quarterpipes that suddenly count as walls.- Stunt-system is lackluster, making both the Stunt and the Speed&Style gamemodes kinda ""meh"". Not a wide variety of tricks, no comboing, cooldown given for stunts doesn't value the aquired points / the stunt difficulty properly (One barrel roll cools 50%, two rolls cool 50%, three rolls cool 55%, so why would I ever do more than one at a time?).Visuals+ Bright, neon-y graphics style, somewhat reminding of TRON.+ Great futuristic racing atmosphere, scrating that itch the same way games like F-Zero or Wipeout do.+ Decently detailed car, which can be recolored for a feeling of individualism (said recolor will be shown in online multiplayer matches!).+ Getting cut to pieces by lasers can look entertainingly goofy.+ Looks great even on lower graphics settings, as long as texture quality is set high.+ A lot of graphics options.+ The entire HUD is on a screen on the back of the car, making the game more emersive.o Activating Bloom is often overkill, causing you to get blinded frequently.o The entire HUD being on the back of the car takes a bit of getting used to. HUD gets pretty much disabled when you get cut in half by a laser.Audio+ Catchy techno soundtrack that has something fitting for every kind of level.+ Music adjusts to surroundings, e.g. becomes muffled in tunnels or gets almost drowned out in zero-g.+ Futuristic soundeffects that always fit their origin (shrieking sawblades, low-pitched rumble for big drones hunting you etc.)+ Can set audio levels for several sources (car, music, environment etc.) independentlyo Music can get old after grinding a level for a few hours, since musictracks are fixed for each level.- The sound of the car's engine is basically just a low-pitched buzz which gets old pretty quickly.Multiplayer+ All tracks are available in Multiplayer, plus tracks from multiplayer-only modes Reverse Tag and Soccer.+ Fully working splitscreen mode for 2-4 players (car collision is ON, so shove that guy off the track! :D ).+ Fully working online mode for up to 6 players per server (no car collision).+ Can connect to a server via serverbrowser or via IP, essentially enabling offline LAN play.+ Host can set password for a lobby, making it private.+ You can play all custom levels from the Workshop online, there even is an auto-download feature in case you're missing a level!o Ingame chat and server messages (e.g. ""x finished the race!"", ""y got wrecked!"") share a chatlog, making it difficult to maintain conversation. But who has time for that anyway, gotta go fast VROOM VROOM.- No dedicated servers.- Soccer and Speed&Style gamemodes cannot be played online, they are local-only.- Reverse Tag mode suffers greatly under higher ping (does not affect other gamemodes).Level Editor+ Big amount of functionality, tons of settings for each individual object. + Can place, resize and rotate objects with high precision for seamless leveldesign.+ Splices on the ends of all track-like pieces, allowing for easy connection between trackobjects as well as intuitive manipulation of tracks.+ Can individually disable abilities of the car for a varied experience, or even set triggers for reaquiring selected abilities mid-level.+ Atmosphere triggers like music changers, skybox changers.+ All advanced hotkeys and shortcuts are also listed as clickable buttons under the 'Tools' tab, making learning the advanced functions less frustrating.o You cannot import custom assets to the editor, like custom models or custom music.o With complexity comes a learning curve. No ""let's just put down some trackpieces"" a la Trackmania, but not too difficult either.- UI sometimes a bit buggy, but can easily be fixed by saving, quitting to menu and re-entering the editor.- Some moving objects have strange behaviour under extreme conditions (like very high movement speed or very small size).

Early Access Review
								It's probably a good time to review now. The developers behind Nitornic Rush made Distance after a successful Kickstrater compaign, in which I was a backer. I played the game since pre-EarlyAccess beta and it's one of those titles that doesn't have a long-lasting attachment feature, yet immediately sinks in as being something unique and great.The production quality of this indie racer made by 6 people is 100 times better than something like The Crew, which shows something... At the very least a clear ability to estimate the workload and project scope in regards to the team's resources. There is no question that the game will be delivered exactly as was promised, if not better, and completely bug-free with great performance. Because it already is. I have no qualms with recommending this even under Early Access because really it is complete. All features promised by Kickstrater campaign have been delivered in time and as advertised. It is strange to praise a company so much just for doing things how they have to be done, but lately so few have been doing so, that as sad as it is, Refract really do stand out as being exceptionally professional and honest about their goals. And having a solid vision to boot.Now the actual game. It's a survival racer where you can drive on tracks, under tracks, on walls, on roofs, you can fly, jump, there are zero-gravity sections and generally a complete and glorious cluster♥♥♥♥ every time you spawn on a level. No signle race will be the same because at some point, someone will decide ""Racing on track is 2lame4me"" and jump on a nearest skyscraper, ride on it's wall to cut, screw up the jump-off, fall onto a lazer and cut off his front wheels (the car doesn't die from that, as long as you can get it to a next checkpoint where it will regenerate any missing parts, it will keep going until it overheats or smashes into something). After that they will make a best attempt to use side thrusters to turn and sprint thruster to get more airtime, overheat, explode and everyone will laugh hysterically.This game is one of those LAN party games that becomes and instant must-have. It is full of hilarious moments. But if Goat Simulator, which is similar in that respect, only has funny moments, Distance posses a huge mechanical depth and complexity unparallelled by any racing game other than Simulators. If you can get past the flying controls and master the ""EveryTHING is a race track"" mechanic of switching between tracks, walls, ceilings, portals, all the while avoiding obstacles and performing tricks to get cooldown and boost more or get more flytime, you will find a very satisfying experience due to the amount of ways every track can be completed in. You can drive to next checkpoint. You can fly to it. You can jump to a wall, drive up, jump off, do a 180‘ flip to land on the part of the track above you and skip to the next checkpoint. You can fly off the track at any time and use building rooftops to skip track parts. And it's not cheating because it takes an enormous amount of skill and training to pull that off without meeting your demise and being reset far back. There is really nothing like this. Distance takes the ""alternative route"" of racing games to a completely new level.Also a very advanced level editor, a ton of levels on Steam Workshop, incredible soundtrack, great graphics and atmosphere, fantastic production quality and a fair price. If you can find friends for a LAN party or organize a group to play in online multiplayer (because generally that part is pretty dead, if you don't organize and host, there are no random servers to join and race), you will have a blast. It is very difficult to properly master this game's 4-dimensional racing, but it's worthit and if you don't want, you don't have to do it. I had a blast taking 14 minutes to reach finish line, just because in those 14 minutes I discovered 34 ways to reach it. Also I love driving half a car. I mean look at my screenshots.TL;DR:RaceWTF I can FLY?Вitch Ima fly past whole track and finish in 15 seconds!*explodes and respawns*Ok, Ima fly to the building, drive on it's wall and jump off 3 checkpoints later!*Does it all*I am so pro biаtches! *Accidently cuts off half a car while flying, with left thuster gone car spins out of the track*♥♥♥♥! Boost! Fly! Next checkpoint! *Explodes from overheat and resets*Ok screw this, I am driving on track.........What's that glowy thing over there? Can I get there? Oooh I can...10/10 would explode again.			",127,14,1,13,4,0,3

								Dear Refract Studios,     Nitronic Rush was a revolutionary racing game and the only car game I used to play. Turning such a good idea into this, its incredible. I know this comment will most likely get lost in the others... so sadly yo may never see this... but thank You. Thank you so much for all the hard work obviously put into making this amazing game.

								This is the most entertaining and satisfying action game i played since ... i don't know... 10 years?A 37 years old, moderate geek shouting loud in the spirals devastated by deadly lasers and fire blades. Can't remember when was the last time when my fingers were sweating on the keyboard...Stunning visuals, greatly designed tracks filled with surprises over every corner. Excellent play with gravity. I didn't know that i needed neon lights and lasers so bad. Music is also good, fitting well to the scenery. Hm, what else..If you have little time, but need some distraction from everyday weariness after a long working day, this will shake you up!10/10Ps. hopefully the devs won't stop here and finish the game. It's already a great take, but still has a lot of potential to be even greater. Big up Refract Studios!			",25,3,2,3,2,0,5

								This game is really awesome.  As the developer of Road Redemption, I take physics and handling very seriously, and you can tell these guys have spent an amazing amount of time on the little nitty gritty details that makes a racing game feel great.  This game is highly polished and amazingly fun.  It's in Early Access, but I think it's worth the price now, even if they make no further improvements (though it's clear that the devs are updating it regularly, and it's sure to just get better and better as it approaches full release).

								There are few games that can sell me on the gameplay alone, and Distance is one of those titles. If you enjoy arcady racing games with friends with style and substance, then you might want to pick this game up now. Or wait until there is more to come.Is There Enough To Go Around?A common complaint about Distance is the minimal amount of creator made content. There is a servicable ""story mode"" that is a good tutorial to wrap your head around the game's basic mechanics, but it's only halfway done. It also doesn't utilize all the game modes in it, so it's not a tutorial for everything. And if you don't screw up too much, you might get an hour and a half of substance.But then you have to take into consideration the wide variety of user-created Steam Workshop maps right now. Currently there are over a thousand user-made content. Most of these maps are probably meant for solo so-hard-yet-so-fun players, not so much for multiplayer players. (Or it feels like it from what the devs showcase on their updates.)The best way to think about Distance is to think about it as a game similar to Audiosurf. You can plug in your own tunes into the game, you can get tons of hours of enjoyment out of the game itself, and the amount of content is more to what is to your tastes.Thankfully, you won't have to rely on crap-shooting for good user-made content. You can type in a custom search engine in-game to find the types of tracks you are looking for, whether it be thematic things like LIMBO or TRON or Super Meat Boy levels of challenge.I've only played a single game of multiplayer with one friend, so I cannot say anything about the merits of tis multiplayer longevity. We had fun doing challenge tracks meant for one player while racing one another. (We intentionally crashed into one another a lot.)Oh, and best of all, the game's multiplayer can be online or split-screen. Leave it to an indie game from EA to bring back the couch.The point of this section is to state that however much content is left to add into the game, which I sometimes wonder what is left to do other than better optomize the game itself, you will find as much content as you're willing to put into the game. You Sold Me On the CarI'm not going to lie. When I saw what the car can do--fly, do barrel rolls for boosting, and for doing precise jump manuevers with antigravity tracks in Tron--I wanted to get into this game immediately. The inner child who played with Hot Wheels and who wanted to go drive around in Tron came out with this game, and I have no regrets for it.However, because of the complexity of the controls, I don't think everyone will find them comfortable on the keyboard. Doing the necessary tricks to hop off one track and continue on another requires a lot of quick-reactions. Sometimes the maps themselves will limit your abilities, so you need to be comfortable with your controls.It's a little difficult to explain, but the gist of the controls is you steer with one thumbstick and rotate the car with the other. You have a button to boost, another button to jump, and another button to engage flight-form.The game utilizes all of these in complex manuevers. Sometimes you'll need to do a ninty degree flip to swtich lanes, or you need to maintain your boost by doing tricks to maintain your energy. Or maybe you need to engage flight-mode to get back on to the track when you fall off. It feels all natural to use when you get a feel for the controls.Your car is also able to be split apart by lazers, buzzsaws, etc. It's a really interesting visual effect to cut your car in half--but you won't immediately lose if your car gets damaged. If you can sustain the car to the next checkpoint, your car will get auto-repaired. However, based on what gets hacked off, your ability to control the car is also changed.The gameplay is very simple, but with all the different modes takes those mechanics into different manners of playing the game. You have a HORSE style mode, a time-trial mode, a Tony Hawk tricks mode, and a no-checkpoint-shorter-levels mode.There is no weaponry or other arcady elements from other racing games if you were hoping for something like Sonic All-Star Racing/Mario Kart/Diddy Kong Racing in Tron. Nor are there AI opponents to race against like with those games. Distance isn't that kind of game.At its core, Distance is a racing game with more flash and style. But with a really, really sick car.Are There Other Dents?The game can run very shoddy at times because of all the visuals thrown into the game, so if you want the best experience you should close other applications for the best performance. Other than the optomization issue and the questionable amount of content, I don't know how else to criticize the game. The controls feel responsive enough; the gameplay offers more than racing itself; and the game itself is really, really good.You'll have to ask yourself if that is enough to sell you on the game. If not the car, then check out the soundtrack too.Rating of Completion/CompetenceHere is a detailed list of my scale: 1 : A bug-filled mess with zero content or missing many features. Far too early to get into the games. Also, games that get updates infrequently. 2: A game with the beginnings of ideas, yet too soon to invest any time. Check back for updates to see if things improve. (Also, games that play well but do not have all the basic features, such as promised multiplayer modes.)3: A game that is in a playable state, yet may not have all its technical issues sorted out. Features are all available--all game modes--while they may not be finalized. Games in this section are cautious recommendations to buy, so you should check the updates.4: A game that is in a playable state, technically competent, and has enough content to be worthy of purchasing right now. Features are all accounted for and the updates for the game are frequent enough to not discourage cautious buyers. Of course, the timing of these updates should be with respect to the size of the development team. 5: A game that could be considered finished. It is in the final stages of development with balancing and other last minute changes to be resolved to be fit for release.The simple raiting is a brief summary to describe the state of this game. The detailed rating goes into the nuances of what is available in Distance.Simple Rating: 3/5Detailed Rating: 11/20 (55%). A cautious recommendation only for the gameplay.Content: 3/5Multiplayer, all game modes, the second type of car (which gives a double-jump at the cost of no flight mode) and the Steam Workshop level editor are in the game. However, what remains besides the story mode is vague. Quality: 4/5The core gameplay is refined enough that I would consider it in a complete state. The only thing that may hamper it are the optimization problems.Optimization: 2/5If you wish to get the best mileage with Distance, then you don't want other programs to be in the background.Productivity: 2/5While I appreciate the community involvement from the developers making fan-made contests and showcasing their creations, I would appreciate more if they added their own content more frequently. Or simply finish the rest of the game to be in a playable state to get more interest.The updates and bug fixes are frequent enough to let me know they are still working on the game. But I think so many people on the fence with Distance would buy this game if all the features were complete. We're nearing the first year mark of Distance--hopefully, as the devs state, we'll get the full product by 2016.You can only get so far with selling me with the car before I start to question whether we'll ever reach the end.

You gain skill.You start with fundemental basics. Die alot. Suck at controls.You learn. Now you are boosting and dodging good now.You overheat if you hold down boost too long.Now you learn that doing tricks (barrel rolls, backflips/frontflips) reduces the cooldown of your boost.Later slow driving. All of this adds more and more and more the more you play. You'll amaze yourself at what you can do after 5 hours of play compared to the first hour.Insane fun. Easy to get in games, easy to leave.

It's pretty good, when you start playing you are focusing on just finishing the track without dying, then finishing it without scraping anything, then getting diamond, then you realize the roads are really just a suggestion so you start making your own routes, and on and on and on it goes. I have put in an honestly rather disgusting amount of time playing this game and still feel like I'm improving and have things to learn.

INTROWhen you think of some of the more polished, visceral games made by indie studios, you may be thinking of Rocket League, ARK and Space Engineers, but you haven't heard much or anything about Distance!What a shame! Time to change that and get you invested into this wonderful game, I have tried to explain every aspect of the game after playing for 90hrs;--------------------------------------------------------------SUMMARYDistance is a survival racing game, it combines the intense action gameplay into an arcade racing experience, speeding through a futuristic world. You have tight control of a speedy car that allows you to, boost, jump, rotate, fly and avoid obstacles through intense levels. An extensive level editor allows you to create any track you want to make and there are dozens of high quality tracks to choose from in the workshop that are all playable in multiplayer and local (split-screen) co-op.  While you may find yourself exhausted by Distance's mechanics, there are different game-modes, sprint, speed and tricks, 'catch me if you can' and even a soccer game mode to play. The many different tracks will surprise you time and time again and challenge you to race on until you complete the track successfully. Currently 20$ is more than fair and you'll certainly not be bored quickly by DISTANCE.--------------------------------------------------------------PROS Diverse tracks to play in the base game, bundled together in 'campaign' mode that'll teach you the mechanics of the game, serves as an  introduction to the game  Extensive and tight controls; offer a complete and very responsive control over your car (all controls are completely re-bindable to your liking) Nimble and flexible gameplay mechanics; not a typical stale A to B racer; obstacles, short cuts, loopings, riding on walls, skidding and jumping off walls, jumping from one platform to the next, rolling, traps and even flying! Multiplayer; with a fairly crowded community, at least 5-10 players online when I've tried, local ! split-screen multiplayer (whens the last time you've seen that?)  Extensive level editor; to make your own levels for the game, you can create pretty much any kind of level you want, all the tools are there to be used, tracks, traps, decorations, lots of assets. All of them can be played in multiplayer.   Learn from the workshop; there are already dozens of fun tracks to downloaded live (no need to restart your game) into your game and play. - See what mechanics will work for your own levels.  Mechanics react to your actions; sprinting heats up your car and you will explode if you use it for too long, 'cool-down' gates reset your heat, car reacts to damage taken meaning half your car can get chopped off, still you'll be able to get to the next gate, perhaps with greater difficulty  All the HUD, is on the back of your car, your screen remains largely uncluttered  Neat futuristic sound track  Ability to add your own music   Tense atmosphere; neat effects, futuristic surroundings, and diverse assets  Control over many gfx settings, AA, shadows, film grain, borderless fullscreen... it's all there  Leaderboards and scores, not really a pro but ups the replayability per level slightly- trust me you will want to replay a level and improve your score --------------------------------------------------------------CONS  The level editor; it is a bit of a hassle to get started with and the few tutorials are a good start but it will all be overwhelming to start with, I suggest taking a look at Niven511's detailed start on building levels   The main campaign offers too little, too few; It's a rather short, high quality intro to the game that will leave you asking for much more, you will need to re-route to community made levels and multiplayer [Dev has said campaign is already much longer in an internal build, update soon]   The game may feel light-weight; beneath all the flashy, innovation the game offers you may find yourself unsatisfied that there is little to do than to reach the end of each track, there isn't much sense of progress; the diverse traps, effects, the heating up mechanic and different game modes counter this con to an extent but leave the game feeling like it may be missing something after you have played it for several hours. The moves you can do remain limited, there is no AI to beat, the obstacles remain fixed as an 'add-on to the track', only 1 achievement currently  There is only one vehicle model; no other cars to pick from. You can customize the the colours of your car though [Dev has said there will be another car added soon]  A bit of a learning curve; you might get lost quickly, find yourself frustrated with the little mistakes that punish you, the overheating and the controls you'll need to learn. You'll can get over this after you've played for a few hours-------------------------------------------------------------9/10I recommend you go the distance and buy the game! ",526,174,20,37,53,3,34

Early Access Review
								Personal note (18/03/2016): One of the few steam games that you always get back to and never get bored of.Personal note (23/12/2015): Most underrated game on steam.---------------------------------This unique racing game is a lot of fun! I played the story mode, uploaded my own level ('[Challenge] Damnation'), started multiplayer and instantly met friendly players whom I played hours with!Pros Level Editor (Easy to handle; getting started tutorial; comfort tools like 'move along the track' or 'flip' makes it easy to decorate a track.) Workshop with a lot (and by that I mean 'freaking grains of sand at a beach' lot!) of user created levels. Cool driving mechanics like deployable wings for flying capability, deployable jet thrusters and hydraulic jumping to manoeuvre in zero gravity fields or to twist the car around for wall/ceiling rides.) Kickstarter project with already unlocked goals which will be implemented when the game is out of beta: ClickThose are for example: Replay/Spectate Modes (With fast forward/play/pause and driving against your Ghost.),Cinematic camera angles/free camera and Random Track Generation Mode (create vast number of unique tracks at the click of a button with parameters for tweaking and capability to share specific seeds so you can show discovered tracks to friends. You shouldn't be able to workshop-up those!) Various Modes like Challenge, Sprint, Stunt, Speed & Style, Free Roam.. Multiplayer with easy to set up servers. Great audio which makes the tracks colors pulse with the beat! (Importing custom audio is suggested.) Nice, friendly and funny community Support for various plattforms and controller. Small team of devs who  are really confident to make a much more polished and professional game sequel to Nitronic Rush. They have key developers from Nitronic Rush in their team and bring much experience with them. Great forum moderators who take every suggestion thread into consideration and give constructive criticism. There is also a thread with many already suggested ideas listed: Click[survivethedistance.com]Many of those got green light from the devs. Moderators and some devs are playing the game nonstop themself and checking out on the workshop levels, too!Cons Not a fan of the Unity Engine, but I start to like it when thinking about what Distance accomplished with it. Beta status is missing many promised features and is short on many Multiplayer Host options like kick/ban.Also, Adventure Mode & everything is incomplete and subject to change etc.. Not being able to import custom content (audio, textures, models, scripts) to the level editor yet. (But there're simple objects like cubes you can create objects with, group them and save them as ""costum object"".) Multiplayer is sometimes dead. No servers or anything. People come to live when it is getting midnight in europe.As you can see this game is pretty much worth a buy!The next stable update will have better physics, better handling and a great cockpiet view!! I already tested it on the experimental build.			",132,9,1,9,8,1,19

Early Access Review
GeneralI've been waiting for the right time to post my review for Distance, and the most recent update (build 3520, the workshop discovery update) provides the perfect time for me to do so. I bought into the late alpha backer stage in June 2014, and as my playtime would suggest, I've not regretted this in the least bit. Distance was well worth the almost 3x price to buy into that stage ($55), and it has only improved it's features and content since then. This game is a steal for the current $20 it rests at, and I am confident any cons listed in this review or many of the other reviews will be ironed out before it leaves the Early Access stage.Early AccessYes, this game is still in the early access stage. For many games that may means bugs, few updates, lazy devs, and etc. but Distance, and its devs, are far exceeding those predispositions people may have about early access as a concept. It had a very successful Kickstarter campaign and it was also a Steam greenlight game. The game itself is in a fully working and stable state. The main reason behind staying in early access instead of going ahead and releasing is one thing - Features. The devs are very dedicated and have a laundry list of features they expect to be in their game before they consider it complete, and this is why it is in early access. The main features left to be added to the game at the point of writing this review are as follows: At least one alternative vehicle to choose from (+one other for kickstarter backers), an ""announcer"" similar to that of Nitronic Rush but in a different styling to fit the desolate Distance atmosphere, a full replay system with ghosts to race against, randomly generated tracks, and a full adventure story mode (part of which is currently in-game). I'd encourage whoever is considering buying this game to look past the early access tag and see the game for what it is, a very complete experience with some major new features on the way.DevelopersThe developers are not treating this (early access) as a cash cow opportunity to make a profit and run, abandoning the game - they are very active within the community and are an easy bunch to contact if need be. There is no downside I can speak of when talking about the developers in the 9 months I've participated in the community thus far - they are an amazing team and I'm glad they are the ones to be making this great game. Anyone active in the Distance community has probably talked to them at some point, whether it be about a bug report, feature suggestion, or just discussing some of the many community workshop tracks. Occasionally they will host a livestream event to show off some of the community-created tracks on their Twitch[twitch.tv] and we have some great fun asking questions while they host a multiplayer server. All of their contact info is in the bottom-right corner of the Distance homepage[survivethedistance.com].Level EditorThe level editor is very complex, and a few reviews have listed that as a con, but I see the complexity of it as a good thing. The more complex it is, the more can be done in it. Yes, it won't be easy to do, but the complexity means that it can be done. There are a few level editor tutorials in the works, so they should help new players learn how to use it more easily. If you have the patience to sit down with it for a while and just play around, then you'll find that it is a very extensive editor that allows you to create pretty close to anything you want.Pros ListI'll be stealing some of my pros and cons from other reviews, but we are all talking about the same game so the lists would be fairly similar anyway. I suggest taking a look through Icebound777's review for a comprehensive pros/cons listing.The controls are tight, and the game supports many, many types of controllers including racing wheels and flight sticks.There is a lot of track variety and full Steam workshop support for the level editor.The agility of the vehicle makes the game handle more like a platformer than a racer, giving it a ""new"" feeling to the racing genre.There is no concept of ""out of bounds"" in Distance - any surface can be driven on and treated as a potential track. This leads to some crazy routes to get to the end of some tracks.The competition on the global leaderboards is tight, even with all the off-road routes driving on buildings.The community encourages players to use the vehicle mechanics to their full potential, and even publishes videos of how to complete tracks faster to help any players improve their times (people don't keep ""fast"" routes a secret).You can watch a replay of any time on the global leaderboards and race ghosts of them.The vehicle can be recolored with completely custom colors and those colors show up in multiplayer.There is splitscreen with up to 4 players, fairly rare on pc games - as well as online multiplayer.Extensive graphics settings to be configured, including things such as ""Film Noir"" for a black and white look or ""Stylized Outlines"" for the Borderlands look.The car can be cut into pieces by lasers or saws, making for some interesting gameplay trying to control the vehicle without a couple wheels.The soundtrack. Seriously, just go listen to it[soundcloud.com].All audio levels can be edited separately (music, car, environment, etc.)Local custom music support to play mp3's and have the game lights react/pulse to it (Windows only currently).All official and workshop tracks are available in multiplayer. The host needs to have the tracks locally in order to play them however.Not having a workshop track in multiplayer is no big deal, say hi to automatic workshop downloading!There is the option of creating private, password-protected, servers, and a ""connect via IP"" to allow for offline LAN play.Comprehensive and complex level editor allowing you to run wild with whatever crazy ideas you may have.Multiple gamemodes including:Sprint (point a to b race/time trial)Challenge (similar to Sprint, but no checkpoints and no deaths allowed)Stunt (do stunts to get the highest score)Speed and Style (similar to sprint, but the score you get from doing stunts is subtracted from your time)Soccer (only available in splitscreen, it's soccer with a giant ball and nets)Reverse Tag (capture the flag/king of the hill type gameplay where you try to hold onto a bubble for a cumulative 3 minutes and the bubble enlarges the longer you hold it making it harder to keep)Cons ListIf you've played Nitronic Rush, there is currently no announcer in Distance - It is planned.No option of a standard HUD apart from the back of the vehicle, making getting cut extremely annoying in some situations.Currently no dedicated servers, the host has to be playing the game and picking which tracks to play - however this has been hinted at as something the devs want to be in.No custom assets in the level editor - that means objects or music. Local custom music is supported, but no workshop support.Difficulty and skill curve could use some tweaking but if you stick with it, it is possible to learn the ropes fairly quickly.General bugs/glitches ",637,255,22,87,87,14,84

								Call me a dork, but I would never buy this game on sale. It is worth every penny the developers have put on it's price tag, and here's a lazy amateur breakdown of why:• It looks amazing. The game really is very atmospheric, with great sense of speed, and every level feels unique. It's arcade with personality, and pretty great graphics. Honestly, I don't need to say much when there's beautiful screenshots up there.• It sounds amazing. As with Nitronic Rush, the music is one of the greatest things about this game. Even if you don't like the genre as much, you'll find it fitting and very well crafted. Not to mention it interacts with the level, making lights blink to the beat and things like that.• It plays amazing. When we talk about controls in this game, it's important to note that you actually feel you're in control. Which is very important, considering this is survival racing. You often need to act fast, and everything is as responsive as you'd expect. Oh, and the delirious stunts you can pull make you feel awesome. And when you successfully recover from a mistake instead of resetting? That's the stuff.• The developers are extremely passionate, and very good at what they do. That combo means a handful of things: They are very thorough, listen to the community feedback with great care, and in fact get really involved with the player base. A chance to play with one (or more!) of the devs online is barely difficult.• It's got a powerful level editor. And people make the most amazing things with it. It's got primitives, which means you can basically create anything you think of, if you have the time. As a matter of fact, most of my play time was spent in the editor. Creating is fun, and sharing is easy.• Failing is often surprisingly fun to watch. Being suddenly flung out of the track, spinning ferociously, crashing into a nearby building, and exploding into many pieces, all in a matter of seconds... It can be a good laugh. Why be frustrated? It looks great even when you suck.This is one early access game you can trust. It's the most polished and feature complete beta of a game I've seen, and yet it seems to only grow and improve further. Buy this game, buy this game, buy this game. Sorry, that's a bit pushy.			",68,24,6,6,6,0,13

								    If you like Tron, Nitronic Rush, challenging games, car-parkour, dubstep/techno, and atmospheric Indie games that are better than most triple-A titles, you will love this game.     Distance is a really good example of Indie done well, from the music to the visuals, Distance is not just a game, but a masterpiece of art. The atmosphere is prominent, the community is amazing, and the game itself is a very good successor to Nitronic Rush.The good things:-Visuals are fantastic, one of the best looking Indie games I’ve ever seen-The controls are fully customizable-The level design is stunning, beautiful, and fun-Hundreds of community levels, many of which rival the official levels in terms of quality-Music is extremely catchy and fits the visuals really well-Many graphics options-Online multiplayer-Experimental branch for those interested-Challenge levels to put you skills to the test-Unique game mechanics-Short loading times-Powerful built in level editor-Controls are very responsiveThe not so good things;-Performance isn’t always amazing, but a decent PC will run the game fine (keep in mind physics is FPS based, lower FPS = worse physics)-Physics will be weird on occasion (not very often)-Some obstacles are difficult to see, not all obstacles stand out very well (you’ll get used to it though)    As you can clearly see, the good heavily outweigh the bad. If you are looking for a high quality Indie experience you can dig right into, this game is for you.			",47,3,2,3,11,0,1

The soundtrack is amazing!The single player adventure mode does what other racing games can't do which is provide emotion to the player. You are actually pretty terrified of the drastic music and atmospheric change the first time. And the f***ing sound the orange ball thing makes is still disturbing. The music seems to sync with checkpoints and when you die or pass objects. It is immersive and really cool. Can't wait for when the rest of adventure mode is out.			",112,2,2,6,8,2,2

Early Access Review
Intro Distance is a racing game where your main goal is to survive and to get to the end of the level. It’s just you and the track. There are no opponents that can run you off the road, but there are many obstacles. But is it interesting enough to keep you going ? Gameplay When you first start you’re put into the seat of a futuristic racing car where you have to race across tracks and just survive. Just. Survive.But this is not just an ordinary car. Your car can, besides racing at insane speeds, also turn mid-air, fly, boost and jump. It’s quite spectacular to see your car appear, especially with the HUD being projected on the car itself. There’s no true HUD, because the car will show you all the vital information: the direction you need to go to, your boost meter, your speed-o-meter and a timer. The timer allows you to set a high score and I guess that’s the true goal of the game: repeating a level over and over again and hoping that you get better and beat your previous high score(s). All of this is done while you complete random tracks. At the end of the track you’re being teleported to a new one where the whole process begins anew. Except that it gets more difficult with each new track. You’re gradually introduced to new gameplay mechanics and after about 10 tracks or so you should know exactly what to do when an object appears out of thin air or when a new part of the track suddenly appears beside or above you. That still doesn’t make it an easy game. On the contrary; it’s a hard game and you have to choose when and how long you want to boost and you have to perfect your flight and trick abilities at the same time. You’ll frequently crash and burn.That’s partly thanks to the game itself (well, the game designers really), because it doesn’t always let you fly whenever you want to. For me personally it was very confusing because I had no idea when I could or couldn’t use it. Whenever I was about to drop down a track I just pressed the button and hoped that it would work. Unfortunately this didn’t work more than half of the time. When you’re playing a game where the goal is to get to the end of the track as quick as possible then you don’t want to have worry about if you’re being able to fly or not whenever you’re about to crash. It’s a small design flaw in my eyes. You either let people know that they will be able to fly during a track or you don’t. You can’t just change things up halfway through a track. But enough about that for now; it’s still an Early Access title and we must have faith that things can still change. And obviously I understand that the developers want to add an extra layer of difficulty to the game this way. I haven’t yet talked about some of the things that will appear on the track so I’ll try to spend a minute talking about that. The game starts with introducing ramps and other basic/common things you find in most race games. After a while, huge, sharp rotating blades can be seen cutting into the tracks as well as laserbeams moving around trying to cut your car in half (which really does happen and you can then decide to either try and get to the next checkpoint or you can reset to the last one). Not much later you’ll also encounter blocks appearing out of thin air, rotating fans and spikes coming in from all sides. Plenty of stuff to keep you on your toes, as you can see. The game has an Adventure Mode and an Arcade Mode. Adventure Mode is the single-player mode that I was just talking about where you follow a story (yes, there’s a story). Arcade Mode lets you play solo, split screen or online.  Solo gives you different choices than split screen and online so there’s plenty to do. I haven’t yet tried any of the modes except for Adventure Mode but unfortunately that one is incomplete and still being worked on. I’ve seen glimpses of the story but I’m not quite sure that I understand what it’s all about. Maybe soon. Graphics & Audio Graphically Distance is pretty impressive with dark lighting and a dark atmosphere in general, only brightened by colorful neon colors that appear on the tracks and specific objects (now I think about it; it’s shown on pretty much anything that can kill you). It has a cool Tron-like vibe but unfortunately the game uses a lot of basic geometry. Levels are kinda boring and the car itself doesn’t have much detail. I get that it’s futuristic but a little more variety in the tracks would’ve brought the game to life. But, since I don’t know if it’s part of the story I can’t properly talk about it I guess. So again, maybe we’ll know when the game finally releases somewhere next year. The audio consists of sci-fi music with a somewhat frantic tempo. It fits the game completely so this is all good. Sounds like your car crashing and beams and blades closing in also sound great. No, the sound department is just fine. Length/Replayability Since this is an Early Access title the game isn’t yet complete. Still, the Adventure Mode can take you anywhere between 1,5-3 hours I think. After that you will probably have seen it all until the next part of the game releases.But, of course, you can always spend some time with the Editor to create some new tracks yourself, or download custom made tracks from the Steam Workshop. That will add at least several hours extra to the total playtime. Closing Distance hasn’t entirely become the game that I initially expected. I don’t know exactly what I was expecting, but I think that I was expecting a game similar to WipeOut maybe. While it doesn’t even come close to being that game this game is good in its own right. Partly thanks to the fact that it tries to do something different. I honestly can’t think of a game that uses these kind of mechanics so that’s absolutely a good sign. While it can definitely use some more polish and maybe a few changes here and there I certainly like what I’ve been playing thus far. And who knows what more we can expect in the near future ? I for one am looking forward to the final release. For now I’ll rate this as follows: [Rating: 76/100]			",1655,629,69,221,194,16,225

 Distance is a supurb experimental racing game sure to hook you instantly and not let go I have been following this game for years anxiously waiting for the release, and Im happy to say it even   exceeded even MY expectations  Design Everything about the visuals is absolutely BEAUTIFUL and it is no understatement to say that you will be sitting there in awh at points in the campagin. Even the lowest graphic settings makes the game look pretty good. The visuals are also very very optimized, guaranteed to run on almost any machine, which seems to be quite rare with these Early Access Games. Very tron inspired and im a sucker for those kind of aesthetics. Sound Crisp and clear. I was suprised at the amazing sound quality. From the woosh of passing large objects to the crashing sound effects everything about the sounds are just awesome. Music One of the games HUGE strong points. The music fits perfectly with everything. From the high octane Drum&Bass tracks to the chilled out electro you'll defenitley find yourself bobbing your head to the beat. Amazing soundtrack (If only they separately sold it) Gameplay I personally play with a gamepad but keyboard and mouse feels excellent with little to no complaints. However it's prefered to play the game with a controller/gamepad to get the full feel of the controls. With it everything feels so much smoother and I also recomend using the advanced controls for more finer flips tricks and stunts! Wonderful controls Multiplayer The ""Distance"" community is some of the best I've run into. I havent encountered a single problem with the people. The multiplayer gamemodes consist of a simple racing mode, to reverse tag (my personal favorite) and a challenge/stunt mode. All of which you can sink hours into, and theres even more gamemodes to come! Level Editor / Steam Workshop Possibly the coolest part of this game. The level editor is so easy to pick up and learn and you can just upload to the workshop with a press of a button. And getting maps is even eaiser! Overall thoughts A MUST BUY. You have a unique racer combined with an explosive soundtrack, breath taking visuals, a friendly community, and a wonderful level editor. What more could you want?!     ",147,17,4,9,11,1,15

								In a game you are racing a car.Against what? Time, death, the apocolypse? No, you race against yourself.Whether you are hypnotized by the somewhat calming but exciting frequency as the sound of tame but chaotic percussion on your long midnight drive into the abandoned areas of which you so delicately turn the wheel to.Or maybe perhaps you are simply keeping your head, making only the absolute minimal turns as you dodge the exonerate obstacles and navigate the sleek paths while never intending to let go of the accelerator.Perhaps instead you are instead the type to take the eloquent route of the persuasive vocal pathways, and yes, the walls do speak to you my friend, they always have, and you listen, you even hear the ground beneath you grow ineffective as you lift up from the road into a much greater road.And even if, you just so happened to be the daring type, trying your best to be in complete control of kinetics, the forces as your final goal is to bring your car back onto a path only after such a prodigious display of control and finesse.Whatever it is, it is you, and you continue only to better yourself, you have only to gain, you are the driver, you are the car, and you are free.

The environment looks beautiful, and the controls of the cars felt JUUUUUUUUUUSSSSSSST right. The gameplay is fantastic too. Much better than many AAA racing games made by big companies.

								I've been playing the game for only an hour now and I can tell:+Game graphical side is beautiful, at first you may have some problems to see upcoming objects, but thats no deal later.+Adventure mode at the moment (1st day of August 2015) is still in development, but the story is indeed intriguing.+Arcade mode is hell out of fun to play on split-screen mode (yes, this game has a split-screen mode!)+The in-game editor will let you do anything you desire with the game, its complexity ends only on the interface, rest is easy and the effects are amazing!+Soundtrack is good for all the electro-style people+Optimalization is really well-done, I had full settings and fps dropped only 3 times to around 35 fps (I'm using 4 years old PC)What's bad about it tho:-We have to wait for adventure mode to be completed to see what's up with the story.-The online mode is yet empty (atleast here in central europe)Obviously recommend to anyone that loves crazy, skill based type of racing ! ! !Also a little bonus:This game synergize with the music you play, the car tone bars are playing and the track is bouncing with your beats. :)			",55,10,11,0,3,1,0

								Although the game isn't finished yet, what they did to it in a little over three years is amazing. As other people probably stated in other reviews, this game was based off of a college project game called ""Nitronic Rush"" (look it up and you could try it out for free). It stood out from other racing games in the way that you had to survive several deadly obstacles in order to finish the track. The biggest complaint about the game was that there was no multiplayer. So that's one main feature that they added into Distance. Another interesting feature that they added into the game (kinda shocked me) was a level editor with Steam workshop support. This definitely had me sold when It was finally released. So if you're finally board of track mania, give this game a shot. It's much better and much more challenging.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Hands down love this game! It has that arcade sensation, high speed ""must go faster"" mentality while smirking at the wreckless destruction of your opponents' failed attempt at flying to the other side of the track when you need to change gravity. Pressing down the accelerator with the firm grip of your hands, cracking your controller/keyboard with the hopeful desire that the working half of your car, divided by lasers or saws, will pass the regeneration checkpoint so you don't have to redo that one part over and over and over again is a thrill like no other and when you do cross that line--it is a high like no other.It reminds me of Rush 2049 with the wings on the car and the stunts; I am sure it had some inspiration to this game. The tracks are wonderful, the workshop gives it tons of replayability. Create your own tracks. Game modes like Tag, Challenge and Stunt. What else could make this game perfect? More car customizations? More obstacles? Ambient supplement? I mean we could ask for a lot, but the bare necessities are there and they are glorious. If you play with controllers, be prepared to have some spares. The frustration is beautiful.			",659,175,12,86,58,6,54

								I loved Nitronic Rush, so I could easily recommend this game. This also makes me a bit bias, so stating this outright. If you wish for a Demo, search for Nitronic Rush. Over all it is a well-polished game with little to no bugs, and only increases in its polish and content.-----Distance is a survival racer; Get to the objective as fast as possible with minimal deaths. Go upside down, dodge lasers, and do it in style doing flips and tricks using small rockets inside the car, along with wings to fly through the map. By default these are controlled with the sticks on gamepads or wasd with the arrow keys.Multiplayer, co-op, a rocking sound track and Steam workshop make this game all the better, with new songs being added all the time and a massive dedicated community of map makers who have been around since the map editor was a hidden asset in the original game.Current complaints are no mouse compatibility for menus, and as of the time of writing, the campaign is missing quite a few levels, a bit of a steep learning curve for the level editor in my opinion and an inability to sort levels in menus when using the level selector, but both are easily fixable as the beta continues. In terms of difference from Nitronic Rush, flying is bound to space when in air, which I’m not a fan of personally but it's preference (and can be changed in menu).The Developers have been very open with the backers through this process and have been providing plenty of updates to keep backers of the original Kickstarter up to date, I personally believe they will finish the project and it will be fantastic.

What is it?A futuristic racing speed/style game very much in the style of Space Haste and Megarace and other one-time futuristic racing classics, but without opponents and set in a dark, neon vibe.  Atmospherically, this is the best sci-fi racer I've played.  The game offers a single player story campaign, arcade racing mode, multiplayer and a fully fledged Level Editor in which you can build your own tracks.  The Steam Workshop is already integrated, offering an infinite resource of game content far beyond what is already offered in the game itself.  Best of all, you can specify any random phrase or word in the editor - and a track, with scenery and such as in the campaign will be added for you.  While it IS just as easy as typing a word and racing the resultant track, there is some sophistication built in: using certain words in your 'phrase' will add more sprint sections, particular effects, or more flight etc.  It's utterly brilliant and you don't have to be a boffin in order to use it (well, I used it - 'nuff said...).  There is also a full-blown track editor too if you really do want to craft your own by hand.How difficult is the racing?The racing part has absolute precision controls and difficulty in the single-player campaign curves gradually.  There have been past similar titles where you can find yourself bouncing from one wall to the other, but not this one - it's lovely to play.  Jumps and flips are taught by button-prompts on-screen.  Flight sections can be a fair bit tricky however.  Straight flight is easy enough, but the roll mechanics of the vehicle are very strange and I find it very tricky to fly around corners without rolling uncontrollably and spiralling to death.  It takes some skill to play these parts, but practise does pay off and reaching the end of the campaign feels like a genuine achievement. Until then, expect a challenge - especially with gravity being a thing when you're not sure which way up you're facing!  Falling to crash UPWARDS is often the only time I realise I'm completely flipped.  It's crazy and it's silly - but above all it's fun.  Gamepad ninjas will blaze through it, and then roll around the floor laughing at the rest of us with our 50+ attempts to get through that maddening flippy dodgy section without burning up.  The game offers full controller support, including racing wheels and gamepads.  However, while the game can be played with a wheel, the best experience is experienced either with keyboard or gamepad for lighting-fast reaction play.A word of warning: if you suffer from any photo-sensitive condition like photo-sensitive epilepsy, this game might not be for you because there is a lot of flashing neon.  Watch the trailer videos first and judge for yourself.About that Early Access thing...The single-player campaign is rather short at the moment and, on its own, is not enough to warrant a typical AAA full game price.  However, there is a ton of content already in the Steam Workshop (some 700 new tracks the last time I looked) and these are seamlessly integrated with the game's 'Arcade' mode, plus the infinite possibilities of randomly seeded tracks, you'll never be bored.  As far as multiplayer goes, it seems really popular but check the game forums (I don't play multiplayer so I can't offer comment on this).  As a single-player product though, Steam reviews are giving an ""overwhelmingly positive"" for a very good reason: it really IS a great game already.  If you enjoy Wipeout-style games and not troubled by a lack of AI racers, then this should definitely be in your collection - it's worthy even as an Early Access title.Highly recommended!

								Distance is one of those few racing games that feel really unique. There is normal racing, wall jumping, no gravity, flying & jumping. These are all ways for you to finish the different tracks (And there are a lot due to a good community), many tracks have more than one way to finish the race, and sometimes one of the options might be better, other times it's the same or just up to your skill. The game offer a few different game modes, spring which is normal racing, go from start to end, you can respawn if you fail and so on. The other is challenge, it's like sprint but shorter and no respawn, so prepare to fail quite a lot. There is also stunt, the least attractive game mode this far, where you are just suppose to do different stunts to gather a high score. There is also a multiplayer only game mod with the name ""Tag"" or something like that.Tag works like the classic child game where one or more are chasing the others trying to ""tag"" them, however here it's the other way around, everyone is chasing the one with the forcefield, and you win when you've held the ""tag"" for three minutes. Quite fun. The car is customizable when it comes to colours, I do hope they add more customization though, since it's always a plus. But for a early access game this game works really well! It never crashes unless you've tabbet it for quite some time. All maps have a high score screen where you are not only competing against your old record, but also against all other players who play this game. I would love if they added something like Trials where you can see how the different players have been driving, because sometimes you do suspect cheating.I really recommend this, one of my best buys this year!

								Have had this game since December 2014 (When it first went into early access). Distance has more polish to it now than most Triple A games out nowadays, and it's very impressive considering it's not even done! Best and most functional Early Access game I've owned or seen on Steam.With Distance, the main game mode is getting to the end of a track as fast as possible. Some levels can be scenic, and others can be a ride through hell, but it's insanely fun regardless. Slick visuals, tight controls, and metric butt tons of community content to go through and download (I have 500+ levels downloaded so far!). The level editor is incredibly deep and allows for tons of creative levels to be made.As it is Early Access, the adventure mode isn't complete but will be when the full game comes out sometime soon.I don't regret grabbing this at all since it's been basically fully functional for over a year! It only gets better with every update. 10/10			",217,127,11,43,17,4,12

								Incredibly polished for an Early Access title. It gets difficult very quickly, but in Adventure mode there's no penalty for failing, you just restart at a checkpoint and try again. The additional Arcade mode, where you compete against others for the best score, time, or a combination of both, along with the user created levels, means there's almost infinite replayability. The graphics are gorgeous, as you can see in the screenshots above, and the soundtrack is incredibly well integrated with the action (although there's also the option for a custom soundtrack - which I have not tried - if you get bored with thumping techno). The sound effects are also really well done. The ""whoosh"" as you pass an obstacle really adds to the sense of speed. Well worth buying for anyone looking for a different type of racing game.

								I imagine if you are reading this review you know already that Distance is a futuristic racing game.  A lot of the time you will be racing flat out, that is until your boost begins to overheat which cools at the next regeneration point.  You also get to jump obstacles, fly and wall/ceiling ride.  The game requires a high-level of skill and concentration, especially on some of the tougher levels!

The devs have included a track editor which mean there are around 1350 tracks at this present moment, and remember this game is still in Early Access!!  Not that you can tell this is a beta, it has the functionaly of a finished product and is extremely rich with features.One planned feature not yet implemented that I'm most excited about are replays!  The game, as you can probably tell from video and screenshots looks absolutely gorgeous.  To have the ability to watch back (hopefully from external views!) a race in replay mode will be divine!  The engine appears extremely optimised and on my i5/970 runs extremely smooth, not even the smallest sign that any component is breaking a sweat!The current campaign is quite short but also acts as a tutorial or introduction to the various moves at your disposal.  Although it is short it is extremely fun and very atmospheric.  The lighting rythmically flashing in time to  the dark techno pounding out your speakers and the weird static effects hurtling you through the environment really create for a highly enjoyable experience.  They are still adding to the campaign, but it's so fun I've replayed it a few times.You've also got leaderboards, online play, time/score challenges to keep you more than occupied.One problem I had initially was with the controls when attempting to switch surfaces to drive on.  Using the control pad to switch from floor to wall for example meant using the left and then right analoge sticks.  Previously this was my only apprehension about the game.  After perusing the forums a couple of other players recommended to switch the controls to advanced mode.  Now this frightened me a little!!  The game requires enough skill as it is without adding to it!!  Advanced mode meant that I now only have to use the left analoge stick to wall-ride.  So I can steer, jump off the road and then use the left analogue stick again to adjust my angle in the air to meet the wall.  Previously movement in the air would've been with the right stick and it felt extremely unintuitive.  Maybe this information can help someone else too.Full release is planned for later this year.  There's really no reason to wait, the game is an absolute stack of fun and a dream to look at.  Sci-fi racing at its best!!			",1300,356,64,91,101,18,164

								Well, I clocked over 600 hours on this game and I can tell you that it's very fun & addictive because there's many levels from the official ones to the custom-made ones. The level editor is very good because it allows you to use your creativity freely. You can also choose game modes from Sprint (the most used one) to Reverse Tag (battle style but with tag rules) or play Adventure Mode, which can be both fun and creepy at certain times. The devs are great because they listen & communicate to the community and add suggested features to the game.Pros:+ Great gameplay+ Great level editor variety+ Great communication with the communityCons:None that I think of.Overall, definitely buy this game if you are a arcade racing fan!

The community is amazing and the game isn't even finished yet. It's able to create atmospheres of futuristic and dystopian environments extremely well. Jumping around doing crazy tricks, dodging obstacles at high speeds and making the tricky track switches is still very rewarding.If you love driving cars, beautiful environments, and crazy high speed tricks and flips, get Distance. :D			",101,9,1,9,3,1,5

								Distance is the perfect blend between a racing and a platforming experience. It reminds me of the classic Trackmania which I loved. It is really addictive trying to master a track by shaving off fractions of a second on every corner or just doing crazy stunts while avoiding over-the-top obstacles. Here is my experience with the Beta...Driving: Responsive, arcade controls for driving, jumping and flying. The game works well with a gamepad and provides sensible layouts for many controllers. It would be nice to have a button to reset the camera though. I like the way the car handles mid-air maneuvering. Sometimes collisions with obstacles can feel a little bit off. I also wish there were more obstacles that you can interact with, like the lasers - how about destructible surfaces or gravity fields?Aesthetics: The world looks like it was partly inspired by things like Tron, but feels much more gritty. It features impressive lighting effects and a great soundtrack. You can get an amazing sense of speed through the visual and sound effects, combined with the track design.Story Mode: A good way to get accustomed to the controls and obstacles, as it has a very nice learning curve. It sets the mood with some awesome set-piece moments that don't feel tacked on.Tracks: The track you choose determines if you are playing a race against the clock (Sprint), a hardcore platformer (Challenge), a Tony Hawk-like playground (Stunt) or all at once (Speed & Style - my favorite). The various tracks often allow multiple paths which require some skilled driving and creativity while making split-second decisions. If you get off-track, there is usually a way to recover. The ability to make your own tracks in the editor or download community ones gives this game longevity. Multiplayer: I have not tried the different multiplayer modes yet but I am eager to get into it now that the game is on Early Access.			",456,124,15,39,33,3,65

								Ok, I love this game, and I'm not one for long speeches, so lets get to the point.Pros)     Art style is beautiful.     Music complements the art perfectly.     The new procedual tracks are awesome.     Multiplayer is completely stable.     You can customize your car's colors.     Challenging and fun at the same time.     Great concept.Cons)    Cannot use the mouse in the menus. You have to use the keyboard.There is very little in this game that can be targeted for negative criticism. The game is graphically stunning. The controls are pretty rock-solid. Music is great, and you can now add your own music into the game through MP3 files. All-in-all, I completely reccommend this game.			",105,7,0,13,31,0,14

								""Overwhelmingly Postivie"" and deseriving. I've never seen so much done with a racing game before. A slew of insanely creative mechanics, beautifully futuristic landscapes, and awesome controls. There's everything from a twisted contored labrynth of death traps, to flying in zero gravity, and even a psuedo-jumpscare somehow- that's all in just the campaign (which isnt even done yet!). The devs are updating constantly and alongside the campagin is an arcade mode with several deep modes inside all in coop, single player, or online. Great slew of options and customization too. If this is the future of racing games I want to be a part of it. Highly Recommended			",212,122,0,36,25,5,29

								You start off playing a very innovative and unique (in my experience at least) racing game. As you continue you notice that it is incredibly well polished for an early-access game, and could very easily be confused for a finished product. What's this? You can add your own tunes to the game and activate something called ""Boombox"" mode. Neat!It is at this point that you realize during your lesiurely drive somebody has slipped you some very bad ganja. But that's all well-and-good, because even though you're dodging neon buzzsaws and freaking lasers, your co-pilot squirrel Mr. Nutters is pumping your favorite phat beats into your pulsating cranium and any real danger can be easily dismissed from high up in your flying car.

Early Access Review
								TL;DR: Awesome game for a decent price with graphics that're way better than the screenshots above make them look. Buy it YESTERDAY, but don't expect a super-realistic driving game or even a MARGINALLY realistic one. I don't even think the cars have breaks--but if they do I've never used them.A pretty unique game that feels less like a driving or racing game(due in large part to the slippery and unrealistic car) and more like a sort-of... Sonic-y runner with survival elements. Irregardless of how the game feels however it is inarguably one of the most fun experiences I've ever had. The game is challenging at times but for the most part is very fair, even in most of the workshop levels I've played, and it introduces a pretty cool universe(though one which reminds me too much of Tron to call it wholly original) that I REALLY want to learn more about, as well as some mechanics that I can't really say I've ever seen before.You'll find yourself frequently and seamlessly switching from driving on the ceiling and on the walls, only to jump off two and a half seconds later and flying over an endless void. After a while, you'll land on solid ground again-- and if the planets align, you'll be actually horizontal on the GROUND and not on a wall or the ceiling, and nothing will be trying to kill you. At which point you'll probably make your car JUMP and do a couple flips for bonus points. This is the game's biggest asset, in my opinion. Everything just works--and works so very, very well. Jumping from a walll to the floor or vice-versa has some occasional hiccups, but otherwise the physics engine is constructed so well that the game just FLAWLESSLY and instantaneously responds to your commands in a way that I'm too illiterate to describe. The controls just feel so right... I'd even call them close to flawless. When you're a car, it drives like a car--a car that can jump, flip, and drive when half of it gets shredded by laser beams, but a car nonetheless. When you leap into the air and deploy your ♥♥♥♥ing WINGS, it feels like a plane. The game instantly transitions from a really solid(but floaty and weightless) arcade driving game into a really solid flight simulator--but it does it so well that you don't even notice most of the time.Another huge plus is the striking art style. It feels reminiscent of Tron, but it has its own unique flare that defines it as its own, like most of the rest of the game does. It looks really overly shiny and neon and it's not something that I'm usually very fond of, but it works REALLY well. The screenshots and footage on this page seriously do not do the game credit in this respect.The obsticles in the game are also pretty awesome, in combination with the car's damage model. Imagine Metal Gear Rising where Raiden's sword is a grid of laser beams, and you are the watermellon. Obviously your car does not like to drive as well if it is split in half, but it can take a lot of abuse as I recall.The lore and universe in the game gives me mixed opinions. The developers have made it clear that they'll probably change a lot of the ""story"", but as of the time of this writing the game has a really solid universe and what seems to be the beginning of some AMAZING lore to build off of, but it doesn't really do anything with it. It attempts to almost tell the story through the tracks as you race through them, and while it translates pretty well in some ways, it doesn't really allow you to get a good idea of where you are, why you're there, and what the hell is going on around you, and it certainly leaves you drawing blanks for specific details. Story is by no means of any importance in a game like this and when the tracks are designed so well that they should make AAA publishers feel inferior, I really don't mind too much, but I simply can't help but lust for more lore. Hell, I'll sebtle for a two-issue tie-in comic for god's sake.In conclusion, the game has its faults, but I'll be damned if I can name any of them. I'm too busy trying to beat my backflip record.In a car.			",90,6,4,23,20,2,8

								I can't really describe the feeling I have while playing Distance and I don't do much reviews of games so it's gonna be a bit clumsy.Anyway. Let's list the awesome points :- Excellent EDM music that puts you into the action and the race like nothing can do. (Unlike in the previous game, Nitronic Rush (which I recommend too), you don't have the ""interactive"" music where it does some more sounds & notes when you jump : I personnaly liked that a lot but I can understand that it's not added in this game)- Intense speed sensation when in fullscreen and with the right setup.- A tight gameplay that will challenge your skills and reflexes, I think that's one of the most interesting gameplays I had on a race game. You get the fiber really fast and once you have it : badass race at every corner.- The decor (mostly in space) really matches with the music and the speed : combining colors and speed brings you into a psychedelic experience that is really enjoyable and made me feel a bit of that 90s vibe I got in Nitronic Rush.EDM, Speed and Space what can we ask more to have a badass experience ?Now let's list some of the bad points that could be improved : - More content (like the story). But you know that's the principle of a game where you put passion : forever getting better. And I don't doubt they put passion in it.I sincerely don't have anything bad to say about it because I know that with time things that are missing will get implemented. Full confidence into the dev-team.Freaking buy it my dude.			",52,8,1,4,4,0,0

								The mixture of flying and driving is incredible and perfectly executed (with a PS4 controller at least), it feels like a game with many years of work behind it.

I'm a massive Dirt 2 fan and this competes very closely, the dynamics are completely different but still rewards you in the same way.11/10 would pay way more			",19,1,0,2,2,0,2

Custom music support combined with 1700+ maps from the community keeps the game feeling fresh for a very, very long time. Most entertaining racing game I've ever played and I'm not really a big fan of racing games but I keep coming back to this one. Highest replay value I've ever seen for a racing game, once you start learning how to master the controls of your car you'll start finding unconventional alternate routes you can take on most tracks that make you think outside of the box and makes for a really fun adventure.

It's [Beep]ing awesome.-It gives you a lot of control over the visual flashiness of the game. [Stylized Outlines on/off, Vignetting on/off, neon bloom on/off, Etc.]-Since it allows you to adjust the steering sensitivity on-the-fly, you can just as effectively play on a keyboard as you can on a gamepad.Cons:-If your computer isn't above-average, you probably won't be able to set the graphics very high [but in my opinion it looks fine anyway.]-The online community is nearly nonexistant, and when you DO find a server, it's either private, full, ongoing or for some reason you can't connect properly. However this game is entertaining enough in single player anyway.-On the rare occation you get into an online lobby just fine, it's almost definitely going to be a track that's nearly impossible to beat.

First of all, should you buy it? Hell yes!Great concept, nice and smooth gameplay, amazing community an quiet beginner-friendly. There are some official maps, but tons of community created stuff which is really nice and challenging. The game itself is like a mixture of Trackmania, Rocket League and SAMP DD/DM Servers. The only actual goal is to finish the map in the fastest way.Since it's still not complete there are of course things you could still add, like achievements or something else to unlock, custom vehicles, tuning parts or a money system to buy these cars (which don't exist, yet). So far, you have 1 car model which you can't modify except some color options and ranking lists (Current Party, local, friends, global).Beside this, the music fits in really well and isn't getting boring after a few hours of playing. But if it does so, you still have to possibility to add your personal music straight into the game.The price of 20€ is very okey, too but for 10€ on sales it's definitely worth it! The game may still be in progress but you can play it already perfectly fine with nearly no bugs at all./Edit: One negative thing is, that there don't really come updates...			",61,6,4,7,2,0,1

Early Access Review
								I don't really know how to feel about Distance. It's not a bad game at all, but having owned it for the year it's been in early access, I was expecting more to be added I guess. I bought it wanting to see where it would go, and it hasn't really gone anywhere. It was kind of already done when it came out.I've had this for a year and all that's really been added is tweaking/bug fixes, workshop optimization, and new stuff for the level editor.There hasn't really been anything major that's been added. All I can think of is a cockpit view and some new camera angles. And the ability to change how bright and intense the visual effects are. No new cars, no real customization like tricking out your ride, no new modes, no new mechanics. It's fun but you're just paying for community made content honestly. That's where the bread and butter is.It's kind of like Trials Evolution in terms of base game + insane community created content. Only that game was finished when it was released. I guess I was just expecting this game to grow a lot more than it has.I wish there was a neutral option. It's a fine game, but my own disappointment due to my expectations has made me not want to recommend it. Maybe this will change when it's released. I guess judging it solely from a vanilla experience the answer is no.Update December 2016: It's still gone nowhere.			",178,21,10,24,12,0,38

Early Access Review
								For the record, I got this game recently. Not because anyone recommended it to me, but i stumbled upon it and thought. ""hey. what the heck. looks cool"". I couldn't have been more wrong.This game is more than good. It's Absolutely Outstanding.From the moment I started the game I was greeted by disclaimers saying it was an early access game and may change. and to report bugs if I saw any. Off to the main menu I went and by goodness was I surprised on all the features it has!You can change the graphics to black light, film grain. shell shaded. <- (which is my personal favorite) and you have a feature to pretty much bass boost your game into completely shaking the maps. which is. Let me tell you. Just the best.My first few tries at racing were. pitiful to say the least. But wait.. racing would mean you have competition? In this game really the only competition is you. and multiplayer have you, but you feel so compelled to do better. to get gold.. (i've seen diamond but i'm just not that good yet) and I have to say that even though it's been years since i've played a racing game. I find this game to be one of the most enjoyable experiences I've ever had. There is so much fluidity with all the functions of your car. and learning about them and hell. even mastering them makes you feel like a badass.This game's artstyle is to die for. but the best part about this is that the music. dynamically changes the maps. not in obstacles or things it throws at you. but Interacting with certain colors. pulsing. and it's mesmerizing to say the least and albeit very distracting that it becomes an obstacle some in itself (not a bad thing mind you) and to top it all off it has VR support and you can add custom music, user made tracks. and even play splitscreen. all in an early access game.TL:DR Please buy this game. You will not regret it. It has something for everyone. <- i bought this game 1 day prior to this review. and haven't dropped it since.			",81,8,1,29,7,1,14

Early Access Review
								EDIT: I'm editing this review to say this truly is one of the best racing games I've played in a looooooong time.  This may even be my favorite racer of 2014 (Although, to be fair, there weren't too many racers in 2014). The track editor seems really confusing to me, but apparently not to others because the tracks on workshop are ridiculous. Also, 3 hours may not seem like a lot of time for this game, but considering the short ""campaign,"" most of it is workshop levels. Of course, keep in mind this is still an EA game and there are bugs (like being able to take advantage of flight and skip entire portions of track) but overall this is a fun, refreshing game. Disclaimer: I came into the game with absolutely no expectations. I had never heard of the studio or the previous game.Summary: Distance is a game that's reminicent of a combination of Trackmania and the Hotwheels stunt games. Even in this state, it's very polished. My one complaint thus far is the lack of content, however, like Trackmania, this game offers a full fledged track editor even this early in development. If you like survival racing games but you're concerned of the shortness of the campaign, wait until the full launch. If you like the aformented but enjoy creating content yourself/playing other player's content, just get this now.Gameplay: The gameplay consists of survival racing, where you manuever your car around obstacles and flip the car to reach other surfaces. Very fast paced and fluid. Only complaint thus far is sometimes it felt like the car flipped too slowly, but it's minor. Also want to note the attention to detail here. When a lazer cuts the car in half, it actually feels like that half is missing and the car is considerably harder to drive.Graphics: Game looks pretty nice even now. There are more graphical options than most AAA titles that come to PC. Optimization is okay right now. On a 760, 3770, and 8GB of RAM, I'm getting 30-60 fps.Story: There is a story, but frankly I skipped the cutscenes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Distance is a game where you have to drive, and fly, through a winding track.  This is one of the best racing games I have ever played.

								Distance is pretty cool, I guess.You play as Robot Car on your journey through a strange city like landscape who's roads just so happen to make a sick race trap. Robot Car was speed through the city, avoiding danger, harrowing death traps, hostile defense systems, and a strange alien entity hell bent on destroying Robot Car.So it's basically Brave Little Toaster, only faster. Distance is a driving game where your main objective is to reach the end of the map as fast as possible without crashing or slowing down, the faster you go, the better your time ends up being. There is also a story mode where you have to go through a long gauntlet of tracks, but as of writing this review, the story mode isn't 100% completed.Each track takes the form of a long street filled with twists, turns, loops, and traps, and your car has all of the abilities necessary to reach the finish line without turning into that strange red substance I find on my mattress. You have turbo, jump, flight mode, the ability to descend quicker, and wall/ceiling riding. Much like the clothing I steal from the back of goodwill trucks, the controls in this game are tight. Taking corners, drifting, flight, and jumps all feel satisfying and easy to pull off. There's nothing more satisfying than going full speed from wall to cieling to floor to wall to floor without slipping or crashing into the wall like a drunk suburban girl who can totally hold on to that mechanical bull. Distance's biggest bonus is it's multiplayer. Not only can you race others for best time, but there's a workshop in place where other players can upload the maps they made. These maps range from stinky maps that suck to maps that put all the tracks in the main game to shame. Some times you're tested to the limits of your skill as the creator throws everything he can think of at you without making it impossible. Should you play Distance?Yeah, probably, do what you want, I'm not your dad. Distance is fun, fast, thrilling, and basically everything I want in my outrageous action games. Refract Studios, the developers of Distance also made another survival racing game called Nitronic Rush, which you can get for free off their website if you want a taste as to what you might get in Distance. I'd check that out too, because it's also pretty rad.Length gets 8 walls popping out of nowhere and you're going too fast to react on time out of 10. According to JK Rowling, wizards are constantly crapping in their pants. Multibillion dollar franchise here, folks.

								Distance. Named so, because that is the challange. Getting from point A to B. But really, so much more than that. Sure, you could say that time is the challange, or that it's other players in multiplayer, but really, it's yourself.This game... I don't even know where to start. It's AMAZING. Most car-based games I've played are limited to racing, and driving on the GROUND. In this game, what even IS the ground? Sure, there's gravity, (most of the time) but you can drive freely on any flat or flat-ish surface you can get to. This game has NO invisible walls, no limits.Most games in Early Access are unfinished shadows of what they could be, lacking most gameplay, and just a proof of concept. This game is in a state that they could release it from beta, and it could be considered finished. Years of work have been put into this game, and I'm glad to have played it before it offically came out on steam. The game has a level editor, and while it IS a bit tricky to use, it's limitless with what you can do. It has Workshop support, which means you have 100's more levels than the developers could make in the time they have. Already I've seen some pretty cool levels.  I've seen levels that look like Tron, and levels that looks like natural mountions. My SINGLE complaint is the sorting system for the levels. They should have a way to sort from most recently updates, by name, and a few other things.Over all, 10/10. This is NO exaggeration.			",136,33,6,21,12,0,1

								Got this on sale, spent 9.99 EUR, worth it.I just finished the so-called ""Adventure"" mode, which is a tutorial and ~10 levels with (mostly) increasing difficulty.After watching a few videos and being 80 minutes into this game I can say this is something good, something new. Something cool. The music fits the gameplay.Briefly, this is Tron, TrackMania, Blur and Death Race mixed up all against you.I haven't already tried, but as far as I can see, there are several types of multiplayer modes (add Rocket League to the mix), including soccer... One thing I fear that knocking opponents into the void is disabled.Good stuff.Can I recommend it with two thumbs up?			",90,1,2,1,9,3,5

								I have put over 500 hours into Distance at this point, and I thought it would be a good idea to give it the review it deserves. I eagerly awaited early access, having been introduced to Nitronic Rush by one of my coworkers. My first playthough of the adventure mode left me stunned; in its incomplete state I still felt that I had just experienced a Portal game for the first time.Adventure mode ramps up the difficulty nicely, teaching you the skills you will need in multiplayer. After cutting your teeth on adventure mode, there are hundreds of community levels available on the workshop, and this is where the game is played. After earning a gold medal on all the official levels, and sampling the best that the workshop has to offer, it's time to start publishing your own levels. I've made six levels to date, and I have a seventh in works.The Distance community is also extremely friendly and easy going :D ",35,4,3,7,3,0,4

								Incredibly fun. The game is as great as it looks and is surprisingly well polished for a beta. I wouldn't have even thought it was a beta if I hadn't seen a message at the start saying so. The only thing's still missing is the remainder of the missions in the Adventure mode.There are no timers which you have to beat and no other cars to race against (unless in specific game modes). For the most part the game requires you to traverse and survive the level which throws a variety of obstacles at you, such as looping roads, lasers, moving saw blades, ramps, flying sections, and so on. Add in the stunning visuals and nice music and you have an awesome high-speed sci-fi driving game.There's plenty of content. Adventure mode has you go through the official 'main story' levels, which get gradually harder and introduce you to new challenges each time. Then there is also a level editor (which I've not explored thoroughly yet) and plenty of community-made levels to try out. And if that's not enough, there's a feature called Trackmogrify, where you type in a random word or anything else and it generates a race track based on it using some sort of seed generator. You can literally type in anything. Just whack random letters and numbers in and see what comes up.I particularly enjoyed the nice little touches, such as the car receiving very visible damage from the obstacles, like laser beams cutting parts of it off or even slicing it in half and the car still going. There seems to be an enormous attention to detail.Only thing I am not too fond of at the moment are the parts where you have to jump and land onto sideways or upside down roads as it feels pretty clunky and requires absolute precision to get right, especially when a level chains up 2 or more of such parts within a short distance. Is it unfair? Most times no. But it can get very frustrating, because it creates a sudden difficulty spike in the level and causes you to die again and again and feel like you're not making any progress. In essence, the learning curve for those sections is very steep, even though they're very much doable.Overall this is a great game. I would highly recommend it for those who enjoy some high speed challenge.			",267,51,3,33,6,0,17

								This game is fookin awesome for a completely finished game.  The only thing is... its still early access...  Yea, think about that for a second...  How many games (ever created) can claim something like that.  My PC hasnt had an upgrade in a few years and it still runs this flawlessly.  Graphics: kicks ♥♥♥.  Music: kicks ♥♥♥.  Every track I've played kicks ♥♥♥.  Loading Time:  Shorter than an ADD kids attention span.  Race track?  Screw that, I'm going to outer space.  See you at the finish line whenever the hell I feel like!Also, Im not sure why, but I *really* like the way the items on the course blink with the sound tracks.  And the very nice transitioning of music between segments and courses (and when you crash and burn).So far I have only downloaded one community track but it was just as good as the ones that came with the game originally.  I tried the map editor for only a few minutes so far just to see what it was like.  Honetly, it's going to take a lot more time to get comfortable with the massive amounts of tools at your disposal in there.  But that is a good thing, I think.Im not completely sure at this time, but I think I read someone else mention there are only 6 people making this game or something.  If that number is even close, I have to salute these guys.  Amazing quality!Im not just giving this a thumbs up, Im recommending it to anyone I know that likes racing games and will be gifting it to a few people for Christmas for sure.  I am definitely looking forward to where this game is headed and I am glad to have been an early supporter.  Thanks fellas, and keep up the good work! ",27,1,0,4,1,1,1

Some crazy obstacles with stunning effects.....you/'ll see....Get it on sale it\'s worth it.

Early Access Review
								Quality of early access game:Very high, the devs keep adding content and have the game already very polished from the get-go so you don't feel ripped off that it took them forever to finish the game.This game has full workshop support!Glitches:To be honest, it already feels like a finished game, it just has a few glitches here or there that are mostly User interface.There IS currently a very obnoxious part of the game where you have to go to the workshop > collections > all collections and subscribe to all of them so the people hosting the multiplayer games can host pretty much anything.This is the result of the fact that downloading host maps in-game is currently not possible.Have you played Nitronic Rush?Yes? Then this is a better, faster, more polished version of that with multiplayer, fun new gametypes and the best damn level editor you've ever used.Haven't played Nitronic Rush?Distance is an (currently as of writing this) unfinished early access racing game by the digipen grads that made Nitronic Rush as their capstone project.Gameplay: You drive a car that seems to be a mix of an electronic sports car and a jet pack, as the car itself can not only fly but also has small thrusters on every section of the vehicle which are 100% necessary as the roads will end suddenly and this forces the player to literally jump, spin, and twist to another track section. The controls are tight and feel satisfying when you pull off a trick or make a perfect landing.It's about going fast and avoiding MANY obstacles, which can range from pretty much anything and everything. If you get hit by a laser the game will remove parts of your vehicle realistic, and you can keep going to try and rebuild at the next checkpoint, it's often hilarious!Graphics:wow, just wow. The game is absolutely beautiful. I haven't seen such amazing reflection (specular) mapping on anything in video games in, ever. The game has some CRAZY filters and lighting that results in areas having feeling to them. I.E. a VIBRANT red area that is very in your face with it's obstacles will make you tense up and concentrate as you dodge as much as you can. While a cool blue zone, even if it has more obstacles, might make the game feel a bit more relaxed.Even in multiplayer the game is very atmospheric, allowing creators of custom maps to be extremely creative.Story?There IS a story, it's very abstract. Not as in it's trying to be artsy, instead it goes for a more vague, mysterious and atmospheric feel. Without spoiling anything, I think you'll enjoy the story if you like video games that don't shove the story down your throat. Do keep in mind, as it is early access, the story is not currently complete and only has about ten levels. Which will actually take you a good hour or so to complete them all, much longer if it's your first time playing it. Multiplayer: Yes, it has multiplayer. Currently players cannot collide with each-other. Instead every player shows up as a real-time ghost, which surprisingly doesn't actually make the game less fun.There are a few issues here or there unfortunately, as the physics for the game are connected to the frames-per-second, you may collide with walls or pieces of track even though you thought you landed just fine. Do keep in mind this has happened to me only two times in the over a hundred multiplayer races I’ve driven.The other game modes are pretty fun too, reverse tag is just a big game of keep-away, It's pretty fun, and results in some silly moments.Difficulty:This game is has a very subtle difficulty curve. It starts off easy and explains mechanics as you go by, then it gets surprisingly difficult. When you finally get used to the difficulty of the game it semi-mellows out to the point of making it easier but still challenging. Once you get good at it, you'll start trying new shortcuts and attempt tricks to skip parts of tracks. The custom maps however range from incredibly easy, to insane in how difficult they are. If you get a large amount of them and play with some people (or friends if you have those) you'll have a blast.Conclusion:Distance is fun, REALLY fun. It breaks many of the assumptions we have for racing games and makes the game feel fresh and new with it's style and feel of originality. It's very atmospheric, and that personally is very appealing. The addition of multiplayer and custom map support is genius and makes the game feel fresh almost indefinitely. It may not be finished but it sure feels like a complete game at this point. 9.5/10 One of my new favorite games. Can't wait for them to finish it!P.S. If you want to have a demo for this game, Nitronic Rush is the best way to do that, it's free; just Google it.			",160,14,1,14,16,0,20

Early Access Review
								Very artistic and quirky style game with heavy leaning towards fast arcade style action on wheels. Almost like TRON in terms of visual style. The techno soundtrack adds a very definite atmosphere and style that will propably either help you either hate or like this. I personally am mixed how to feel about this, I like the style and innovation, and for me the techno is no real deal breaker either, it adds to the genre. But there is something in this game that gives me an unnerving feeling. The levels are innovative but somehow it just does not feel enough in terms of longetivity or variety. And by longetivity I mean not how many tracks there are but the repetition gameplay wise. It never evolves beyond that. This is a bit like wipeout was on ps1 but somehow that game for me was more fun and entertaining than this one. This game looks and sounds really cool but I'm not really feeling it. Also there is this weird vibe to the general feeling of the game. Wipeout had this upbeat positive vibe. This feels like the opposite somehow. These are propably a matter of personal preference. I still recommend trying this one out. It's definitely either a love or hate type of game depending on your preference. I'm not really delving in to the details of this game because theres enough coverage of that. I just add my 2 cents in which is more about the way games make me feel, good or bad. This one gets a mixed reception.			",36,9,0,1,4,0,2

								The best early access game I've gotten so far. Gameplay seems mundane at first but quickly increases in craziness. This game is more like an obstacle course than a traditional racing game, which is a lot of fun. Since its in early access, there aren't that many levels in the base game, but I've downloaded 100+ community made levels, most of which are absolutely phenomenal, so don't worry about a lack of content (and this is early access we're talking about). I highly recommend changing the control scheme to 'advanced' as soon as you load in, which allows you to move your car around mid air (sort of like in GTA V) without taking your thumb off the boost button. Believe me, its necessary.			",194,38,8,19,12,2,13

Early Access Review
								This game is super good.There's not much of a story of to it yet, so to speak. In a nutshell: You're a car, and ♥♥♥♥ got ♥♥♥♥ed up somehow, so you have to un♥♥♥♥ it by driving really fast. And that's about it because early access.Gameplay wise, it's solid. You have two sticks, two triggers, and two buttons. Fairly simple, but then you learn you can drive on walls by jumping onto them, and it's really rather good. You can also fly, and that opens up a whole world of opportunity for track skips.Graphically it's pretty good as well, so yeah.The soundtrack is exactly what you'd expect from this sort of game: Lots of EDM and dubstep. And surprisingly, it works. However, if that's not your thing, then you can play your own music so that's good too.But what's really, really, super good about this game, is that the developers put in a random track function, which generates fairly short tracks to race around based on a seed you put in. This essentially turns the game into the video game equivalent of potato chips: You start with just one, and then you do another, and then next thing you know it's two hours down the line and you've eaten the whole bag.And the workshop's pretty good too I guess.Overall 9/10. Like skyrim, but with cars and laser grids. ",144,4,15,6,23,0,10

								As said to my other friends... ""Cause you can be driving along at 200,000,000 miles per hour. The game wants you to go through a portal. Now you are driving upside down on a spiral and wants you to kick off the wall, flip over and land on a wall parallel. Then from that point another portal and then you are at the top of the map. No gravity. Go through another and you are going straight down..through a grid of lasers and saw blades""Beautiful. Just.. Wonderful. Refract Studios. Give us More. ",92,5,4,10,18,0,8

								Like to race? Love the TRON: Legacy movie? Enjoy the graphics of Borderlands 2 and Saints Row IV? Buy it. Plain and simple. For a beta, this is the most fun I've had on any beta yet! You not only race, but you roll on twisting roads, right walls, race on ceilings, and even fly.. There are so many things that can slice you in half it's crazy! Car sliced in half? Survived it without flying off the track? Do you best to get to a checkpoint. It'll regenerate you.. Trying to get there is hilariously fun though!Bottom line, if you're bored and don't mind spending $20, GET THIS GAME! You won't be dissappointed!*There's an online option and an editor for tracks on there. I'd avise those with experience in graphics programs to try this out as the editor is very very detailed. You can do a TON with the editor :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								If you want to know what this game is like, compare it to a combination of:  F-Zero, Star Fox, Portal, and Rocket League. To me, this game seems awfully similar to the old Hot Wheels Acceleracers (in terms of just about everything), which was my absolute favorite movie series when I was younger. I had always imagined what type of game Acceleracers could be made into, and Distance, by far, exceeded my expectations.10/10 A dream turned into reality :D ",30,8,5,2,0,0,1

								Distance is a very high-speed and reflex-intensive racing game. It's still in Early Access, but the experience (in my opinion) is already extremely satisfying. It's the kind of game you can play for 5 minutes or for hours on end. Currently, there isn't a whole lot of official content, but the amount of community maps is absurd, and most of them are amazing. For now, the (still in progress) story mode serves as a kind of tutorial which runs you through the official maps.When you go online, there usually aren't many (or any) hosts, yet invariably, within ~3 minutes of hosting your own server, people will quickly begin to join. I don't know why people are reluctant to host matches, but they're there, and ""if you host it, they will join."" Furthermore, the community is friendly and helpful.This game is perfect to get your mind off of things, as you'll quickly be engrossed in the satisfying mechanics/gameplay. It has a strange ability to demand your attention, present you with mass chaos and intense gameplay, yet somehow be very relaxing at the same time. I've never been big on racing games, but I wholeheartedly recommend this game for people who have a need for speed and people who love skill & reflex-based games  ",158,34,1,26,16,2,17

								The game is great.To start off the game is atmosperic with its abandoned, futuristic world. the gameplay is great and allows many approches to a problem. For instance one time I was playing a level and there was obsticles I couldn't find a route through so i flew over them. That bring up another point, this game is hard, but it is managibly hard. Respawns are quick and you are always close to your faliures. If you are finding something too hard you can play one of the many other challenges and there is alot of content, from pre-made levels to community levels and even the trackmogrify tracks. The game's level editor is good, if you can use it but it can be challenging to make levels if it's your first time.The only big promlem, that is still small, is that the framerate does sometimes drop.overall it is great with alot of content.

								Let me start by saying that I absolutely loved Nitronic Rush, a college project made by Refract before they were, uh, Refract. Nitronic Rush was basically Distance except with a different story, car, graphics, and music. Now the car mechanincs were exactly the same, this is obviously a good idea for Refract to do. I really liked the way Music played a big role in Nitronic Rush and it sorta does in Distance, though not as much. I can't tell if I miss the narrator from Nitronic Rush or not, it was pretty funny to hear him narrate all the tricks you did. (""Holy Teledo!""   ""Sad Day!"") Moving on, Distance is truly a unique and wonderful game, posing a challenge and new gameplay style. I haven't seen many ""Survival Racing Games"" Before, and Distance is a good one. Everything Feels really smooth and the levels are satisfying and Challenging at the same time, not to mention that multiplayer is a lot of fun. Even though the Adventure mode is really short, I can guarantee that you will have endless play time. This is because the game has a level editor, and ""Trackmogrify"", which is an element where you enter a word or phrase, and it generates a track for you to play. The VR support looks nice and any new updates I can expect to be just as good. But this game, it is worth it, but do give Nitronic Rush a go, it's free!      http://nitronic-rush.com/P.S: Nitronic Rush Gives more of an Arcade Racer, while Distance is more Serious, but both retain a huge amount of fun!

								This game is absolutely amazing, even in it's current state, it seems (In my eyes, excluding the fact that Adventure Mode isn't finished) to be completely functional to be a fully working game.And with the ability to have custom music, make the map shake to the beat of your music AND have the entire map flash as a visualizer to your music, the ability to customize the colours of your car, multiplayer madness... This game is basically everything you ever wanted in a survival racing game.At it's current state, I'm giving it a flat out 10/10.Review might change as updates come in ",198,38,7,12,22,4,9

			Today I'm playing Distance by Refract! This game is currently in Early Access (beta). This game is crazy and I'm seriously loving it!		

I absolutely fell in love with this game. It looks great and feels great to play. It's very responsive and the levels look just beautiful! With the bonus of steam support already functioning this game is just great!			",334,70,4,49,75,9,62

								A neon-style Trackmania with VR support. I bought the game a long time ago but never realized it has full VR support but as I got my HTC Vive and played the game in VR again I had a blast!It runs really smooth (most tracks with stable 90+ FPS), looks stunning and it has a lot of content due to the workshop support and all tracks can be played in VR which is really awesome and so much fun! The soundtrack is good as well and some light effects in the game are synced to the music which makes it look and feel even better.Anyway you could get a bit nausea on some tracks in VR. I didn't have problems with motion sickness in any other game yet but sometimes I felt like I have to stop playing after a while and driving intense tracks.Distance is my favourite seated VR game yet and if you own a Vive or Oculus and you like games like Trackmania I can only recommend to buy it!

								Distance can be a bit frustrating at first, but if you can control it, it's a game that can be fun with friends and the nice community. There are many tracks, some of which are beautifully designed by good map creators and have interesting concepts. The community is friendly and helpful, the cars are fun to drive and sometimes you just feel like drugs. The game definitely deserves a chance when you are a fan of the genre.			",86,22,11,4,8,0,13

								Tron, mixed with the ability to race or fly at almost any time, seemless teleportation through warp gates, some damn awesome community made maps, Variety of game modes, although Sprint with 5 of your best mates is likely to be the most popular and heavily played. The ability to jump onto walls and drive on the ceiling, defy gravity, pull crazy stunts and drive with half a car after recklessly driving through a laser grid is just pure awesome. Most tracks have various routes that can be taken, shortcuts that are filled with dangerous traps but are all the more satisfying as you weave, fly and boost your way through those hectic shortcuts to leave your rivals in the dust. It is still in early access, meaning the adventure mode is yet to be fully completed, however bugs and glitches seem to be quite rare. However i WOULD recommend a controller, using the keyboard is a tad difficult for quite a few of the maps.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is so incredibly fun! As some of you know this is from a concept that was created in college by the guys, it was called nitronic rush. After what they have achieved from there to Distance is particularly amazing!  My first thoughts I had in my mind that this was early access (just released as early access on december the 10th). As soon as i got into playing the visuals are spot on, the gameplay is extremely fun and addicting and the overall concept is great. Yes, then i discovered the mechanics: Boosting, jumping, flying and wall jumping; crazy stuff like that! THE POTENTIAL I can't even begin to explain the potential this game has, at the moment it actually is decently polished but not many official levels and progression pointers and goals, i'd imagine that to be fun. But there is the community making levels and there is a powerful level editor, it's nice that it has that. There is the Adventure mode which is short at the moment (and there isn't a story to it really). Arcade mode which has various gamemodes in it to play your community levels and official levels.  So, do i reccomend this game? Yes, i do. If you'd like to support it at it's current state i'd definetley reccomend for you to purchase it. It also has multiplayer and a friendly community which is great! SIMILAR GAMES: Trackmania, LittleBigPlanet Karting.			",81,9,10,6,22,0,8

								Would I recommend Distance?WOULD. I. RECOMMEND. DISTANCE?In a word, yes.But let me tell you why.I should start with the fact that I've been playing Distance since the later stages of alpha. I've put almost two-hundred hours into the game and more into building the community, from starting a weekly event (Speedy Saturday!), doing weekly community track showcases (with over 600 tracks at the time of writing this, there's a lot of tracks to go through!), and doing a 24-hour charity livestream called Distathon to raise over $2,000 with the help of the amazing Distance community and the developers!Not only are the devs some of the coolest people, but the community is boss and just keeps growing.The game itself features tight controls, a solid learning curve, a sick soundtrack, intense level design and so much more. All wrapped up in a nice little burrito of tron-hotwheels-mashup goodness.One of the VERY few games that's able to keep me coming back, I believe if you're at all interested in a game that's the lovechild of tron and hotwheels, you'll enjoy this.:)			",513,92,9,22,27,3,19

								lol decided to update my review, because my previous one was not helpful :PDistance is a great game. It has all the stuff that will keep you coming back for more, and for it's current stage in development, pretty much bug-free. The game's mechanics are awesome - stuff that I've never seen in vehicle games before, such as your car getting parts sliced off wherever lasers pass through, and the ability to fly, flip, and drive upside down.The inclusion of 4 players splitscreen, AND online multiplayer really makes this gem of a game stand out.The best way to describe this game is probably TrackMania + Tron + Jet Car Stunts. In my opinion, the only thing it's lacking is a battle mode (i.e, weapons). I understand that a lot of fans of the original Nitronic Rush want Distance to be very similar, but that's no reason not to add a separate battle mode - why not have the best of both worlds?In all, definitely a ""must own"" in my books, and it's something that I'll always come back to for a quick 'fun' fix :)			",44,6,33,2,6,0,0

								Hands down, the BEST $20 I've ever spent on my Steam account, developer did an amazing job with this one! To me it clearly evokes the the style of Tron, but that's merely my opinion.

								Distance is an experimental survival racing game made by Refract, who previously released Nitronic Rush during their time at Digi Pen.  Nitronic Rush can be downloaded for free at http://nitronic-rush.com/.  If you are at all interested in Distance, play Nitronic Rush first, as they are very similar.In Distance, you control a kickass sci fi car with thrusters, wings and a giant rocket booster.  You race through digital, TRON Legacy styled cities filled with lasers, buzzsaws and angry computer viruses.  While the new art style is very pretty, some clarity is lost behind all the bloom and neon lines.  In Nitronic Rush, obstacles and hazards were always a very bright red, while in Distance they can and often will be a similar color to the rest of the track, making it somewhat harder to see them at a Distance (heh). In addition, the world seems more lifeless compared to the 70's TRON world of Nitronic Rush.  While this seems to be a deliberate choice on Refract's part, given that Story Mode seems to focus on an abandoned world, this doesn't change the fact that the levels are rather sterile and samey.  With the exception of one song, most of the soundtrack, while great, is also very similar which is an odd change after Rush's varied beats.    While the game is still in beta, it does have a slight lack of content when compared to Rush.  There are more Story levels, but fewer Challenge levels, and no Hardcore levels.  The overall level design is a bit more tame and safe than Rush's was.  There is both a track editor and a random track generator to make up for this, however, and many of the community tracks are incredible (and a good deal tougher than the rather easy official levels).There are a few other game modes besides the races.  Stunt has you doing mad tricks in an arena to score big points, Speed and Style is a mix of Stunt and Sprint, Reverse Tag is a game of keep away/king of the hill, and Soccer is, well, soccer.  Stunt is rather boring due to the lack of an announcer, another feature missing from Nitronic Rush.  In addition, several stunts possible in Rush are missing in DIstance.  Speed and Style is good fun, as you have to win the race AND pull of tricks to win.  Reverse Tag is a fun game of wits, though the official arenas are all either too big or too small.  I recommend the community level ""Pipe Plaza"" for this mode.  Soccer is a mess, the ball is nearly impossible to control and  the levels are a cluttered nightmare.  It might be good for some couch laughs with 4 players (Distance features Split Screen for all modes) but should be avoided in smaller groups.Now, despite these complaints, I still highly recommend this game.  It's the most fun I've had with a racing game in quite some time, and is beautifully creative.  Even if you don't like traditional racing games, give Distance (or Nitronic Rush) a shot.  They're very different from the competetion.To finish this review up, I'll make a list of little things that you probably don't care about-Default control scheme on controllers is flawed, thange LB to boost like it was in Rush-Bring back the announcer-Bring back wheelies and side wheelies-While you're at it, just port all of Nitronic Rush's levels into Distance			",189,22,2,18,10,1,9

								I started playing racing games during the glory days of Carmageddon and ""FZR2000"" ;) and i have remained unimpressed ever since NFS Underground.It's hard for a racing game to impress nowadays... Why ? well we kinda seen it all... haven't we ?I mean.. what could they possibly do to impress us ?Well Distance did it...The game features a fresh take on the trackmania recipe with pleasant Tron-ish graphics.The soundtrack is ok but considering the way the actual game plays ...perhaps something a bit more ""strong"" would have been better.You don't get to chose from X number of cars and have only one which is slightly customizable...a color here and a accent there. Strangely i never felt the need to change my car and i never felt like the game would benefit from a larger variety of vehicles.So what is this game all about ?Driving as fast as you can and avoiding all obstacles as swiftly and as elegantly as you can.The game features several game modes such as Sprint, Stunt, Speed and Style, Challenge etc...When it comes to multiplayer we have either split screen (up to 4 players, only one can use keyboard the rest have to use controllers, and in 2 player mode you can chose vertical or horizontal split screen) And then we have the online component for up to 6 players.The game includes a full and very complete level editor and steam workshop support (for which you can already download over 100 tracks). Obviously this can ad a ton of replay value, and if you fancy yourself a hot-shot designer maybe you will make the next ""epic track"".There is even a single player campaign which is used as a tutorial and introduction to this futuristic high tech world (full of sharp/pointy/blunt death-traps that are in your way!).During this campaign you will learn how to barrel roll, fly, hover and glide in zero gravity.The games main mechanic is the boost. There is no recharge time for it like in most games but you do need to be careful not to overheat or else you go BooM! There are some gates which will either partly or fully cool and regenerate your car for all the damage taken up to that point.Something i really liked was the way the HUD is done, it is mostly integrated into the game elements, which dose lots for the overall feel of the game. There are some who do not like this aspect because at times the HUD is not visible. In my opinion this is not a big deal because a game such as this should be played by.. ""feel"" if that makes any sens...Another design element i really appreciate is the way vibration is done for the 360 controller. This is used to GRADUALLY warn you about how overheated your car is. This means that you can keep your eyes on the track and off your rear bumper. When it comes to the ugly ""early access"" tag i would go as far as to say that Distance dose not really need it. The single player campaign is not complete and the mouse is not functional in all menus... but these are all the early access ""scars"" i could find in my time with the game.I can go on and on about Distance but i don't wanna bore you to much so let's wrap-it up.""The Good""-The Track Editor- is not exactly user friendly but its a very complete tool-The Graphics- although graphics are a rather subjective topic in my opinion-Gameplay- rock solid, pure gaming, no nonsense-HUD Design- this is the way a HUD should be done in modern games, yes it has some issues, but its a big step forward from the classic and outdated designs.""The Bad""-Only 6 players in online multiplayer...How Could You ?!""The Meh""-Soundtrack- I believe there are much better options for a game that plays like this...but again this is a subjective topic by nature.What else is there to say ? Drop the clutch, boost to max, juke the spikes and i'll see you at the finish line...if you get there ;)For a clearer view you can watch my first impressions video :

								What would it take to redefine a genre?I guess in the case of racing, Refract decided to try throwing in cars with boost jumps, parkour, wings, and tracks with deadly traps.And my god does it work in extraordinary ways.Distance is the successor to the cult hit Nitronic Rush, now with online support, a slick new art style and some intense, dark music to go along with the split-second adrenaline rush of dodging traps by the skin of your teeth. It has some superb, abstract track design reminiscent of any of the TrackMania titles, but adds in the insane speed of a Need for Speed or Burnout game combined with obstacles taken right out of a kart racer. It could also be safe to say it's the Tron: Legacy we never properly got and then some, cuz it's got the bells and whistles but is a much more enjoyable and entertaining experience. That's also a major disservice to this incredible beta to an incredible game.The Early Access version of Distance offers quite a lot for a small package, including the makings of an adventure mode that add in a Journey-esque dash of story... if Journey had lots of giant sawblades, lasers, and death-defying jumps in a cyberpunk setting, on top of a traditional Arcade mode that games seem to have lost touch with in recent years. And of course, there's the aforementioned multiplayer which throws in your traditional races as well as a briefly novel tag mode and a stunt mode that takes another queue from Burnout minus the exploding cars. Buy and large, the main reason to play the game is for the ""Survival"" or ""Speed and Style"" modes, where it's testing your reflexes and split-second maneuvering around traps and finding clever (and stylish) ways to beat a track in the quickest time possible. Mastering these stages is a delight and even just killing five minutes to feed a need for speed while jamming to some intense electronica that makes you feel like a badass when you nail those impossible jumps is an insatiable feeling that makes me always want to come back for more.It's just a shame the current version doesn't have a lot to offer when looking at the official offerings, but the game's taken a life of its' own with the community created maps. It's just a small shame that one of the problems the game suffers, and what goes into common community level design, is the confusion of good map design with unfair memorization challenges. It's these types of maps that make for way too many unofficial tracks that feel overbearing, sloppy, and infuriating when compared to the more official offerings that have good ebbs, flows, and difficulty curves in each track that were both challenging but also more than possible. However, that's not to say that there haven't been rising stars in the community mappers as there have certainly been tracks that rival even Refract's stages, which make slogging through the sloppy maps worth it when you come across that solid, tightly-designed gem. But as it stands though, the map-making scene isn't as vibrant as, say, most of Valve's games or Unreal Tournament, so the Workshop might feel barren, at least until the game picks up in popularity and creative level designers.That said, this game, frankly, deserves a lot more of that popularity, because it's just an absolutely fun game to play, with the bonus of being a great looker with a damn fine soundtrack. Refract might be one of the new Indie kids on the block, but they are certainly no amateurs at making a great racing game. Distance is worth your time, your money, and your commitment to beating your own and your friend's high scores. In this day and age of more realistic, simulated racing games, it's time we had a game like this to come along and remind us we're playing video games for the overwhelming, exciting, and expansive possibilities of the medium and not needing to be bound by realistic settings, physics, and speeds.So, can you survive the distance? You should jump behind the wheel and find out.			",444,92,6,38,27,4,38

								Right, so first of all this game is in Early Access so yes there is tweaking needed and a lot of other stuff however that will not change anything about this review.-------------------So I bought this game after seeing something on Youtube about it back in June 2015 and like most of the games I've got I thought It was an amazing concept, looked stunning and looked very well made so I purchased it.Throughout the course of this game's development it has went through some very good changes and the developers are constantly looking to add more.I recently contacted the company asking them if they would be open for some feedback and they were! It actually surprised me that they were, not many developers/companies these days want to deal with feedback. They have replied to me everytime I have responded and honestly I am glad I purchased this game to support their hardwork.I recommend this game to anyone, it has an amazing concept and look extremly good for what it is. I can't get enough of this game and to be quite honest I can't wait to see what they add in the future! They have already added some amazing things and I'm looking forward to many more!

								What a fun, unique little gem of a game!  A driving/platforming/flying/puzzle game in a beautiful (and at times dystopian), TRON-like world.The game is mostly about driving and jumping over or dodging road hazards, but with touches of flying. The puzzle element comes into play on rare occasions where it is not obvious where you are supposed to go.  You can use your set of driving/hopping/flying moves to find the level's exit portal.  You can also sometimes jump on the sides of walls and grip to them.  It can leave you not knowhing which way is up.  That is what the 3D compass display is for.The level aesthetics, atmosphere and music are all excellent.  It can be very trippy.  Not in a psychadelic way but more of a zooming through a chill, digital soundscape kind of way.The only negative I can think of is in terms of it's control configuration system.  The game works great with the Steam controller's trackpad for steering.  Turn the steering sensitivity all the way up so it does not dampen your trackpad input.The problem is the game wants to use only your keyboard or only your game controller.   While editing your profile you can not mix and match Xinput controls and keyboard controls.  And the game has a bunch of controls to assign.The game does respond to both Xinput and keyboard inputs.  But pressing something on the keyboard disables the right trigger until you move the analog stick (via the track pad in my case).  So it only listens to one at a time.  It is still early access so I hope the devs can make this more flexible.Control weirdness aside, I highly recommend!			",316,43,29,12,17,3,21

								You like the racing game ? especially the survival genre ? Here is my review of DistanceDistance is being developed by Refract Studio which also made Nitronic Rush ( a free game ) when they we're in DigiPen as Student, so Distance is a sequel of Nitronic Rush.Distance have in content - A short adventure mode who learn you the basics tricks of the game- A Arcade mode with others mode of racing, Like Sprint, Stunt and others.- A Level Editor where you can create your owns track and share it on the steam workshop- Like i said above you can download tracks from others user on the Steam Workshop, you have more than 1600 tracks on it, all i can say these track are really nice and some are hard but can be done by using what you learn in the short adventure mode.About the adventure mode which can be completed in 30-45 minutes, but this one have some decent tracks with decent music. I really liked it. the difficulty is not hard and you learn all the tricks you can use in others levels. My favorite adventure mode tracks is the Monolith one. When you completed this mode, you can go in Arcade mode than sprint, to re do them and get medals, and unlock 3 more levels ( depend of the medals you get )The game is using the Unity engine, which run pretty nice on lower end pc or laptop. If you plan to buy it, i suggest you for the moment, to use the Experimental Build which run better on low end pc.About the Level Editor, this one is really complete you can use the music you want on your tracks, and others cool feature :).I hope you liked my review, and then probably you will buy it. The game is still in Beta ( Early Access & soon in stable build ) but the developers always listen their community, even on twitter and steam forums.The game cost 20€ or 20$ depend of your country, but you won't be disappointed of Distance.

								Distance is one of the games that takes your breath away. I know that you can give hundreds of games that has graphics that are better than these, and you can suggest many other racing games that are much more exciting than this. But Distance just provides something much, much different. In that you are met with such exhilerating challenges, as if you are in a roller coaster. There are several times when I am truly surprised at the turn of events in every sector that was played. I mean, jumping roads, flying, boosters, zero gravity floating, spinning road spikes, blades in roads, dark skyscrapers, portals, and more. You don't get that in a normal racing game.You won't regret it, you wontOne of the most exciting games I've ever played, 100/10 would play again.			",6,3,0,0,3,0,0

								What would it take to redefine a genre?I guess in the case of racing, Refract decided to try throwing in cars with boost jumps, parkour, wings, and tracks with deadly traps.And my god does it work in extraordinary ways.Distance is the successor to the cult hit Nitronic Rush, now with online support, a slick new art style and some intense, dark music to go along with the split-second adrenaline rush of dodging traps by the skin of your teeth. It has some superb, abstract track design reminiscent of any of the TrackMania titles, but adds in the insane speed of a Need for Speed or Burnout game combined with obstacles taken right out of a kart racer. It could also be safe to say it's the Tron: Legacy we never properly got and then some, cuz it's got the bells and whistles but is a much more enjoyable and entertaining experience. That's also a major disservice to this incredible beta to an incredible game.The Early Access version of Distance offers quite a lot for a small package, including the makings of an adventure mode that add in a Journey-esque dash of story... if Journey had lots of giant sawblades, lasers, and death-defying jumps in a cyberpunk setting, on top of a traditional Arcade mode that games seem to have lost touch with in recent years. And of course, there's the aforementioned multiplayer which throws in your traditional races as well as a briefly novel tag mode and a stunt mode that takes another queue from Burnout minus the exploding cars. Buy and large, the main reason to play the game is for the ""Survival"" or ""Speed and Style"" modes, where it's testing your reflexes and split-second maneuvering around traps and finding clever (and stylish) ways to beat a track in the quickest time possible. Mastering these stages is a delight and even just killing five minutes to feed a need for speed while jamming to some intense electronica that makes you feel like a badass when you nail those impossible jumps is an insatiable feeling that makes me always want to come back for more.It's just a shame the current version doesn't have a lot to offer when looking at the official offerings, but the game's taken a life of its' own with the community created maps. It's just a small shame that one of the problems the game suffers, and what goes into common community level design, is the confusion of good map design with unfair memorization challenges. It's these types of maps that make for way too many unofficial tracks that feel overbearing, sloppy, and infuriating when compared to the more official offerings that have good ebbs, flows, and difficulty curves in each track that were both challenging but also more than possible. However, that's not to say that there haven't been rising stars in the community mappers as there have certainly been tracks that rival even Refract's stages, which make slogging through the sloppy maps worth it when you come across that solid, tightly-designed gem.

								I'm gonna go out on a limb here and suggest that, even though this game isn't even finished, with all of the fresh mechanics, sheer amount of levels, and raw epicness it already produces, this is definitely the best racing game I've ever played. Even better than Motorstorm.The first thing that struck out to me was, before I even realized how tight the jumping was, that I could even jump at all; I'm not used to that! Yet here I am now wishing that almost every arcade racer took advantage of this mechanic. Another thing I love is how Refract makes great use of Motorstorm-style boost mechanics rather than standard nitrous, where instead of running out of extra speed, you keep going and going until you overheat and blow up; sure, it's not realistic, but hey, it's much more fun and superb this way as it is.And finally, the sheer intensity and awe you generally feel as your vehicle strolls down the levels are a sight that I honestly cannot match with any other game within this genre, or any game ever for that matter. I mean, your car keeps going even when sliced in half by lasers! Not even Wipeout could match this.I doubt I said anything somebody hasn't already brought up, but it feels great being able to express how amazing this game is. Definitely worth full price.

								Well, this is toughie. On the one hand -- excellent initial idea, simple but very ""tasty"" visuals, catchy gameplay and absolutely gorgeous soundtrack. On the other -- there's definitely very little of in-house made content, and this is the most serious issue. When I played Distance, it reminded of Trackmania in a way, an old one, without all the bells and whistles -- a 2007 Nations, for example, and while the physics here are, well, rudimentary -- the feeling is pretty much the same. But while Trackmania was intended to play online, it still had heaps of content for single player mode. In case of Distance, I was finished with its Adventure Mode in less than an hour.Online mode is something else. Well, that if you'll be able to find public server. And if you'll be able to connect to it. Because there's no official servers or dedicated server software, people should host sessions from their own computers, and since pretty much everybody are behind a NAT these days, it makes a task of finding suitable server really difficult.Ports are okay at the very least -- as Linux gamer, I'm very pleased with how smooth and troubleless game runs on my not-so-fast-by-novadays-standarts-rig. As far as I know, Mac version runs pretty much the same.If eventually campaign will be like four or five hours long, then I guess my money were well spent. I'd like to believe that this is how things will turn up. For now, you'll have to dig deep into Steam Workshop, looking for decent maps.			",100,17,9,13,14,0,15

								Wow. What a ride. Not only is Distance a lot of fun to play, but it is quite an accomplishment for a piece of artwork as well. The soundtrack is killer, the visuals are both beautiful and stimulating, and the coding seems solid and gameplay is fun. It reminds me of trials, except with a different kind of skill focus. Not only are all of these aspects well done, but they are also fantastically blended together - they compliment each other. The visuals go to the beat of the music, and the feel of the tracks blend with the flow of the audio and visuals. It's great. Kind of a ""Audiosurf meets Spy Hunter meets Trials"".Two thumbs up.

Distance is one of those games that is just an absolute blast to play. You'll never find a dull moment while playing this game, unless of course you are exploring the ♥♥♥♥♥ier portion of the community made maps, which I even have fun doing occasionally. The fast-paced madness combined with the epic, hypnotic music makes Distance a game to truly love. I can say with confidence that this is one of my favorite games of 2014, and it deserves more recognition.

								Distance is a very fun futuristic stlyed racing game which i would highly recommend.The actual gameplay is exactly what you see in the trailers and features both single player and online multiplayer. The 'Adventure Mode' which is the campaign at the moment is quite short with only 11 maps which took me just under 2 hours to complete, but these maps were very good at introducing me too the game slowly and made the learning curve very small while still teaching me many new mechanics in each level. In addition to the Adventure mode there is Arcade Mode which allows you to replay levels over and over to get better times in both Official and Community maps.The community maps in this game are very exciting and just as good as the official maps. Many dedicated people frequently make and upload new maps to the steam workshop which is great as it keeps the game new and fresh. All these community maps are playable Online aswell as single player.The online mode is great, although there is usually only 2-3 servers up at a time with a maximum of 6 players you can easily set up your own through port-fowarding. With friends this game can become very competetive, even if you dont have any friends that buy this game with you the community is awesome, you meet new players everyday aswell as playing again with the ones you met the day before. Everyone is extremely supportive on those levels where you are the last to finish and everybody is spectating you but you just can't get past a bit, they say what you should try and even if you DNF you have the next map to beat them on.Overall it is a great game with or without friends even though it is currently in early access and i cant wait to see the future additional content to be realesed with the updates to come.TL:DRPros:- Fun- Great learning curve with the Adventure Mode guiding you through- High mechanical skill cap- Competetive- 5 different game modes   - Sprint (racing)   - Speed and Style (racing but you do flips to get more points)   - Challenge (racing or short very difficult tracks)   - Stunt (do flips and get points)   - Trackmogrify (random gen levels)- Supportive and nice community- loads of community levels uploadedCons:- Small player base leads to only 2-3 servers at a time (unless you host your own)- Is in Early Access			",89,16,9,1,6,1,4

								Distance is worth buying if you're looking for a racing game that involves more than driving down a basic track. It will only take you about an hour to drive through all of the tracks, but there is multiplayer locally and online, and you can retry tracks to see if you can get to the top of the leaderboards. The mechanics definitely make the game more hardcore than other racing games, but if you don't care about leaderboards, the game's difficulty goes way down if you don't continuously boost and ignore the shortcuts and other harder areas to drive through.Video of a near perfect run through the hardest level(Currently ranked 3rd)

								A fun singleplayer & multiplayer racing game.Has visually appealing levels, a good sountrack, and challenging obstacles. It's netcode is functional, but due to the nature of the stunt system some player's movements may appear exaggerated.The level editor allows for the same quality of levels as the official ones, and the community has a decent set of custom levels to play for free.If you like Nitronic Rush, then you probably will like this			",124,13,6,6,6,0,11

								This is a pretty fun racing game because of 1. The ability to fly, and 2. The challenging tracks, but most of my game time was on split screen mode, and tracks are limited unless you download more. It is fun for a while but has no customization, and the maps are very similar. I would reccomend buying it for 10$ like I did, only if you are looking for a fun split screen game, other than that I prefer more open world racing games:-)    8/10			",40,8,5,10,18,0,3

								A heavily Tron inspired, post apocalyptic descent into racing madness.The music pairs well with the increasing difficulty of the tracks (pun not originally intended) and half the time during gameplay I couldn't tell if using a power or two to save myself was intended or not.For instance, on more than one occasion during playing, I had flown off of the track, only to save myself by activating my car's flying powers and returning to it. Were it not for my adrenaline-rushed self preservation instincts kicking in, I might have tried to land on one of the many cyber buildings dotting the landscape- in fact, i ended up doing just this by accident a few times during gameplay.The campaign is still a work in progress, but I find that a short and sweet campaign for this game is the best ticket anyway. It doesn't explain much, and I'm still figuring out how I managed to ""kill"" the first boss, but I did find myself distracted several times throughout the first few levels, trying to read the signage and propaganda scattered across the map. Once again, it reminds me a lot of Tron, especially the internet levels, as it should.In the background, you can see what might be planet Earth, but the geography is bizarre. In the distance I see what I can only assume are inhabited continents, but beneath there's only a maelstrom of some kind, with an ominous symbol in the middle that looks suspiciously like the ""Alliance"" symbol you encounter repeatedly through the game. Further on in the horizon, pillars are visible. What could they mean? Is this all a computer simulation, or is this our horrible future?But if our eyes are real, how can mirrors be real?10/10, would go the Distance as many times as is automotively possible.

								I enjoy Distance, because I'm a guy who loves arcade-ish racing games in general. The question whether you'd like it is depending on your taste of games. It's a racing genre that needs more explanation.So here is my review with a comparison to the older, yet free game ""Nitronic Rush"".The control of the car is great and is heavily improved upon since Nitronic Rush, where you'd fling around carelessly by accident (though this was a lot of fun). Small turns in Distance are not as easy to make though. A controller is nice to use in case you want to aim for a nice time on a track.The story mode, despite being minimal, has an enjoyable exploration feeling; much like it's earlier version. Shame it's not finished yet, but it looks to be promising. Playing this with some friends by giving each other the controller or keyboard is a lot of fun too.This all is nothing I was worried about when it came to purchasing Distance. What worried me and still slightly does is the replayablity of the game. As of now Distance, does not have this so much. Nitronic Rush was free and for me the joy was kinda out of it when I completed the storyline. You've kind-of seen it all by the time you're done with it. Distance's multiplayer aspect improves on this a lot, so does the custom levels and level-editor. If all this to improve it makes the game worth the price tag of 19,99 euro's; I'm not so sure.Eventually after fully experiencing the Story Mode the game turns from survival exploration racing to precision racing. It's kind of the same thing as Trackmania actually. Although there's more control over your car and it's set in a whole different setting. If you're much into precision racing; I see you'll have a decent amount of replayability with this game. Yet if you're only in for the exploration, I think you're through the game rather quickly.Get this game if you like precision racing, otherwise wait for a 40% discount. 33% works if you're desperate to try it.:^)7.6*/10*grade improves as the game improves ",161,17,17,14,13,2,29

								Distance takes the racing game genre and instead of some derpy AI cars to annoy you throws you into a world of sawblades, grinders, lasers, zero-gravity and several ways to crash horribly with only yourself to blame.Jimp, flip, spin, fly and boost your way to victory with the thrusters and wings at your disposal on this strange car that can operate after being cut into a single wheel, or fall into the abyss below the track and crash for the millionth time.This game is one I will be sure to play for a very long time, trying to squeeze those extra milliseconds out of the turns or shaving off several whole seconds by finding a new shortcut to try and get higher on that global leaderboard.With several other gamemodes to keep you entertained you'll easily want to keep coming back to this title, especially with friends.In it's current state I'd rate it as a solid: 9.5/10It's not a 10 because of a few optimization issues here and there.

								So, Distance, this game is about you, a car, driving through a crazy and confusing world full of dangeround hazards, and amazing music. This game has a story mode, which has you racing through a few levels, 12 right now the devs are worink on adding more, it has a arcade mode, which I didn't play and it has community games, which are on story levels, or on custom made levels. The level creater is verry well made, for a racing game. This game also allows you to customize you racer, it allows for a few profiles, which I used for my IRL freinds when we did the split screen games. The thing I had the most fun with though is the split screen mode, which I played a rocket leaugh esk game in which you hit a ball into a goal, but the course is covvered in lazers, saw blades, and other werd traps. I give this game 10 dubstep lazers out of 10.			",124,11,0,8,8,0,1

								If you're into driving/racing games and want pure energetic fun or some difficulty (or even both). Then this is the game for you. Not only does this game of some very well made and design tracks, but it has a feature where if you type in a phrase it makes a track based off the phrase. The game has a split-screen and online multiplayer which games are starting to drop alot (On the split-screen side). The soundtrack is amazing for what is happening, game looks visually appealing. The controls are not stiff or loose and are very responsive giving you on the dime control over what is happening. So the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t crashes, getting chopped in half, or explosions are all 100% your fault unless some sadist on the workshop makes it otherwise. I also have not experienced very many bugs at all and when playing it forget that it is early access.*PROS*-Tracks are well made-Soundtrack is good-Graphics are appealling-Responsive controls-Splitscreen + Online Multiplayer-Track Generator-Car Customizer (Very Basic)-Level Editor (with workshop support)-good amount of options-Can add custom soundtrack playlist*CONS*-Levels with exetreme verticallity can be cheesed Sonic Adventure 2 Style by falling.-?

								Distance really is a phenomenal game. It's fast, it's flashy, it's gorgeous and it's as casual or hardcore as you like. Its main game mode, Sprint, is all about getting the best possible time to the end of a track, while dynamic obstacles are in your way, including lasers, buzz saws, etc. Community-wise, it is the follow-up to the outstanding Nitronic Rush, which you should try if you're not sure about Distance. (It's free.) Distance has a great community already, churning out several maps a week. That fixes all that I would have labeled damning about Nitronic Rush. Additional improvements are a better physics engine, updated graphics, customizable vehicle appearance, etc. Just an amazing game, and the multiplayer is very stable. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Distance feels like an early access for a $60 game. It's polished, it plays great, it's unique, it's a work of art to be honest. It already has a lot of content even in this stage. I spent almost 3 hours finishing the single player and trying to get silver on each of the tracks and there were quite a few, I can't remember exactly but in the 15-20 range, plenty of tracks and they are all unique.This doesn't even take into account that the game comes with a level editor and has a bustling community of users making tracks and thousands of users trying them out.Here is a video of me playing one of the earlier tracks and only crashing twice:

			Distance is survival racing. Fusing arcade racing action with exploration, your car must survive by jumping, rotating, and flying through a deadly and mysterious city.		

I played on my HTC Vive which was what really made this a must buy for me. There aren't very many good racing games for VR and so when I heard Distance added VR support, it went from my wishlist to my library that day.Later on the levels get hard but I didn't mind crashing a few times in order to figure out the tracks, and they all have different paths you can take and discover by replaying and exploring. Some levels encourage you to turn into a 'jet' and fly, and others take that ability away and force you to jump, wall ride, and barrel roll your way around obstacles. Check our the video, if you aren't convinced, come back after EA and hope they don't up the price too much. This is a steal at $20 in it's current state in my opinion.			",154,32,4,6,27,4,6

								Distance is a fast, challenging, and beautiful racing game built by former members of Team Nitronic (Creators of Nitronic Rush).  Distance is a more polished game in every respect, with excellent music, art style, sense of speed, great multiplayer, and steam workshop integration. It is a rare game that is exactly what you see in the trailer.The level editor deserves special praise for being the one of the most powerful and well-designed level editors I've ever used. There are others that are easier (Trackmania's block-based editor, for example) and there are a few that are more full-featured, but the Distance editor is basically all you could need. I have a few tracks on the Distance workshop and they were made completely in the editor.There are some minor bugs and missing features (mouse support on the main menu would be great!) but they honestly don't take too much from the experience. I used to have some problems with getting network games up but that hasn't been an issue recently.The guys at Refract are incredibly engaged with the fans (check their twitter) and have sent emails out pretty regularly since the first day of the Kickstarter; while it's generally good to be wary of titles on Early Access, Refract have already built an excellent game and you are definitely getting your money's worth at $20.

								I'm really satisfied with my purchase. This game is really fun. I've just been playing the Adventure mode for a hour and I gotta say they did it pretty well. The levels keep me satisfied and are challenging. Soundtracks are alright ALLTOUGH THEY SHOULD ADD A PRIVATE MUSIC PLAYER :DSo far it's in EARLY ACCESS so the Adventure Mode is like 1 hour long depends how you play and stuff. ",280,14,14,14,11,1,24

								Fun, fast-paced racing game with an awesome soundtrack and a very healthy content-creating community. Good polish for an early-access game, though futher optimization would be greatly appreciated. Online community has been both friendly and helpful in my experience. Attractive art direction and a great setting. Online isn't feature-rich at the moment, but it'll get you by. The difficulty might be a little high at the beginning, especially regarding jumping onto walls and ceilings as well as gravity shifts, but once you learn how to deal with it it becomes a joy.

								So, Distance, this game is about you, a car, driving through a crazy and confusing world full of dangeround hazards, and amazing music. This game has a story mode, which has you racing through a few levels, 12 right now the devs are worink on adding more, it has a arcade mode, which I didn't play and it has community games, which are on story levels, or on custom made levels. The level creater is verry well made, for a racing game. This game also allows you to customize you racer, it allows for a few profiles, which I used for my IRL freinds when we did the split screen games. The thing I had the most fun with though is the split screen mode, which I played a rocket leaugh esk game in which you hit a ball into a goal, but the course is covvered in lazers, saw blades, and other werd traps. I give this game 10 dubstep lazers out of 10.			",124,11,0,8,8,0,1

								If you're into driving/racing games and want pure energetic fun or some difficulty (or even both). Then this is the game for you. Not only does this game of some very well made and design tracks, but it has a feature where if you type in a phrase it makes a track based off the phrase. The game has a split-screen and online multiplayer which games are starting to drop alot (On the split-screen side). The soundtrack is amazing for what is happening, game looks visually appealing. The controls are not stiff or loose and are very responsive giving you on the dime control over what is happening. So the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t crashes, getting chopped in half, or explosions are all 100% your fault unless some sadist on the workshop makes it otherwise. I also have not experienced very many bugs at all and when playing it forget that it is early access.*PROS*-Tracks are well made-Soundtrack is good-Graphics are appealling-Responsive controls-Splitscreen + Online Multiplayer-Track Generator-Car Customizer (Very Basic)-Level Editor (with workshop support)-good amount of options-Can add custom soundtrack playlist*CONS*-Levels with exetreme verticallity can be cheesed Sonic Adventure 2 Style by falling.-?

								Distance really is a phenomenal game. It's fast, it's flashy, it's gorgeous and it's as casual or hardcore as you like. Its main game mode, Sprint, is all about getting the best possible time to the end of a track, while dynamic obstacles are in your way, including lasers, buzz saws, etc. Community-wise, it is the follow-up to the outstanding Nitronic Rush, which you should try if you're not sure about Distance. (It's free.) Distance has a great community already, churning out several maps a week. That fixes all that I would have labeled damning about Nitronic Rush. Additional improvements are a better physics engine, updated graphics, customizable vehicle appearance, etc. Just an amazing game, and the multiplayer is very stable. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is a review WITHOUT the multiplayer experieance, just single driving throuth the course experieance.Want to see flashy lights and fly with your own music? Distance is here for you.The story mode is not yet complete and adds no real depth to the game as the storyline is non-existant, however it serves as a perfect tutorial without much use of words.There DEFINATELY needs some customizations with the car, custom maps are marvelous but the same car makes it slightly off focus time to time.Maps, lets talk about maps, it's just MARVELOUS! MARVELOUS! I wrote that twice for emphasis. The community maps are all works of art as I wonder how on earth they managed to imagine everything.Blaring flashing lights and the twists, curves, confusion of which way is sky and which way is ground. You may think you're on the ground until you jump to know that you were on the celing.Feel the speed when you speed up, controls start to get difficult as you reach the max speed just blaring your booster down the lane, the subtle shake of the car and blurring experieance is a stress reliever for me!Gameplay is absolutely friendly, as dying is just to reset and get back on course. It sometimes actually helps to find the road where you are stuck on.I would love to use a VR for this game, it would be dizzy and some custom maps seem high on drugs but the feel like you're flying is something that is needed.I wouldn't recommend it for hardcore gamers as it doesn't have depth but if you want to ride and want to defy gravity with speed for an hour or two, I will definatly say it's worth the money.(Though it would be better if you could get at least a 15% sale or something $20+ seems a bit too heavy to be 100% casual.)

								Distance is one of the best ""betas"" I have ever seen, and I almost cringe at the fact that it is still called a ""beta."" The fundamentals of the game have already been so fleshed out, including a great multiplayer and single player expereince and gives you one of those feelings that you need to do something in tune with the music, as this games soundtrack, if you enjoy electronic/dubstep music, is astounding. This game offers a great expereince for those that just need a little game to fall in love with. The environments are also a great feature, with great futuristic aesthetics to them. Overall, pick this game up if you just want a little game that gives a great satisfaction whenever you do anything remotely awesome.Pros:- Fleshed out, despite the ""beta"" tag.- Great soundtrack.- Great singleplayer or multiplayer experience.- Great Steam Workshop compatibility, with some great maps out there already.Cons:- The singleplayer ""story"" could be a little longer, but the game distinctly tells you that it will probably change from the time of this release to the final one.

								As a 'Nitronic Rush' player there are lots of things I like about this game, but there are also a few points which I'd like to adress (note that this is a beta).Let's start with the good stuff:*Amazing style & graphics*Intense music*Great athmosphere*Smooth gameplay*Lots of different areas and modes to play in (race, challenge, stunt etc).*A multiplayer (both online and splitscreen, which Nitronic Rush didn't include, not in real time that is).*A level editor*Good gamepad supportAnd the less good things (along with thoughts):*I have an up to date and strong computer, yet this game sometimes has major framerate issues! Especially during the multiplayer (I'm not the first one complaining).*This game would benefit if it featured a 'drift' system. As it is now the breaks feel a bit off and stiff. I think drifting would make this game extra intense (maybe even awarding the player with points/small nitro bonuses for a good drift?)*The engine/nitro sounds were a bit soft and dissapointing, especially in comparison with Nitronic Rush, which felt much more faster.*In Nitronic Rush there were big spinning blades on which you could drift/slide. Why not make those without the teeth as a drifting platform in a few areas? (as an extra).Still this game is extremely cool and well made thus far, and don't forget it's still in it's beta state!

								Distance is what Aperture Science would have created if they had watched Tron Legacy. This game is absolutely gorgeous! I had to buy it the moment i played it in my friends PC. The visual, the gameplay, even the credits is a masterpiece! If i had to choose the top 3 racing games i've played this decade, i'm sure Distance would have made it second or even first position.Enough with the compliments, let's talk more about the game.Distance is a futuristic racing game like nothing else. You are in control of a car that can boost, jump and fly (yeah, it's a transform). The game has a storyline that feels a bit artistic. It has no narrative, just you, the stages and the musics (that i have to say, it fits just perfect with the game). Since it is still Early Access, it isn't complete yet, but i can already see it developing really good!The arcade mode seems to be really good, even better when played with a friend or in online mode. And now with custom tracks made by the community, i can't even describe how big is the potential of this game.BUT, it has it cons (for now, it might change in the future). In current stages, there is no bots in arcade mode. I feel like this is needed in every racing game, mainly in this game! I want to play the arcade mode when my friends aren't avaliable and online mode isn't quiet what i'm looking for everytime.The storyline NEEDS a narrative. Sometimes you feel a little lonely when traveling through the stages and the music is low. The storyline of this game shows potential and a narrative like the one in Portal games would fit just perfectly.If i would recommend this game to everyone in this planet? OF COURSE! This game needs more attention! I would easily pay 60 bucks for this game when it gets out of early access. It really looks like a AAA game.Plus, spin my car in the air and land it like a boss IS SO DAMN COOL! 10/10			",139,21,5,13,3,2,10

								Distance is everything I hoped for an more in a racing game. This game has brought the joy of racing back to me for the first time since Burnout 2-4, and it has a lot to do with the similar philosophy of expecting player to crash (that's part of the fun!) and letting them get right back to the challenge at hand as soon as possible.The adventure mode, even in its current limited form is a non-stop ride of thrills, stunning visuals, and creative expression through racing. The first time I opened my car's wings and took flight I sat slack-jawed for much of the rest of the level and only stopped to laugh with pure un-fettered joy.This game wants to challenge you, but it does not demand perfection. It wants to teach you, but it won't always hold your hand either. It wants to engage your curiousity and your creativity, in an activity that is so often highly regimented and finely tuned.The community levels (so far) make more of a return to the familiar 'hard for hardness sake' design and don't always have such well placed checkpoints, but with the mechanics present in the game and the tools available I expect to find plenty of maps like the developer's who balance out elements of free running in a car (carkour?) and the already present intense eye-bleeding gauntlet runs.

The community content for it is also extremely well done and extremely difficult but in the good way. Most of it is made by people who have the mentality of mastering the games mechanics so you'll have to do so also but once you do it is a game of pure bliss.			",251,6,0,14,4,0,2

								To people who may be looking for a demo, Nitronic Rush was a single player game made by the same team that plays very similarly (at least in terms of controls) and that was totally free, so even if it's not as polished (graphics are subjective, but I much prefer the updated version) it's worth a try. Also, the game has enough content (on it's own and with the level editor/workshop) already to justify a purchase and constant updates so a very good Alpha/Beta release. Also, the game tends to run very well on my PC, but I can't say much else in regards to performance. (Disclainer: I did back this on Kickstarter, so I may be a bit biased towards it)			",139,64,1,18,14,3,26

								This game was a total GOOD Surprise for me!You drive your ""futuristic car"" in a track that will have several obstacles, traps, route changes and many factors that will test your reflexes and quick decision making to reach the goal with the best time. To overcome this situations you will have different abilities that you can do with your machine like: Jumping, flying, Thruster down, etc. That´s it that is the core of the gameplay.What I didn´t mention is that the TRACKS are...AMAZING!Also, the graphics are very good with great futuristic NEON atmosphere that will pump your eyes while crazy drivingRegarding Content:With the stock game, as today (27/12/2016), you could start playing the adventure mode, Solo mode, online mode and download whatever track the community built in the workshop.Adventure Mode is not complete yet but you will have like 10 tracks with gradual difficulty that will teach you the basics of the gameplay.Solo Mode and Online Mode are modes to play different stock tracks (14) either offline or online...you could play ghosts of your friends too, so that could be the middle option of offline multiplayer jejje. In these modes you will have different ways to play like SPRINT, Speed and Style, etc. I´m not going into details but those are different ways to get score in the tracks. There is another mode that is really crazy, you could type a word or a phrase and the game will create a track based on that! hahahha amazing.The Workshop is another STRONG FEATURE here. The game has a very good community that is not only following the game but also providing quality content. The tracks are organized by Difficulty, the play modes and explained a little by the creators. The result is....A LARGE QUANTITY OF VERY GOOD TRACKS TO DOWNLOAD AND ENJOY.VR Review:Regarding VR FACTOR. The game is very well prepared for VR.You have the PoV from the cockpit and you can select a 3rd person cam that could be adjusted freely.You could adjust the VR SS directly from the game, the resolution, each of the effects, texture quality, etc.Besides all those factors...the game FEELS very smooth and fast.Regarding the speed on VR: this game is REALLY FAST. Still REDOUT is a faster game than this, but the reflexes and reactions that you will make here are unique, and you won´t find them in any other VR game.I´m explaining you this so you could think about your SICK factor. In my case at this point I could say I´m immune.If you can tolerate it, I REALLY RECOMMEND IT for VR. There is nothing like this in VR.If you tried it, and got sick, remember that you could still play the game without VR. So in the end you could still enjoy it and maybe try small VR sessions to train and improve your resistance. ;)The only complain that I could mention at this point regarding the game is that it still being developed, and the stock content like adventure is not yet complete. But really after the first time you enter the workshop and start downloading tracks...you will not care at all. 9/10TOTALLY RECOMMENDED.These kind of games are the good INDIE examples that bring hope to gamers and fresh new IDEAS to the scene.Here is a video to show gameplay with a friend of mine, playing 3 different tracks, so you could see the variety of them:

Early Access Review
								I'm going to start out this review by saying that I have a lot of faith in this game.Despite Early Access, Distance has shown a lot of promise and is alerady an absolute blast to play. There are other, better reviews that discuss game mechanics and what it has to offer, so I'm going to skip that and ask:Do any of you, like me, remember the show Acceleracers?Formed by Hotwheels, this was an animated series that was, in my opinion, one of the best to existance. Basically, the top racers from around the world are chosen to form a small group known as the Acceleracers. They use a portal to warp to other dimensions with prebuilt tracks that they can race on. Each of these dimensions had a different feel and driving technique needed to master it. If you got to the end portal before the one hour time limit and before anyone else, you gained an acceletron; a small card-like device that gives your car ""superpowers"", and is in line with the theme of the dimension that you gained it from.Anyway, the series was insane not because of the tension between the human racers, evil robot racecars that tried to kill them, a secret society formed by the main character's own dad, and the amazing plot, but because of the stunts that all the cars pulled off in the show. Vert, the main character, is known for his car's jets being able to give him a boost upward, effectively ""jumping"". Additionally, cars were souped up with things like nitrox (a glorified version of nitro) and things that allowed them to fly, shoot a grappling hook, etc. One of the most memorable things is when, in the final movie, was when Vert was directed by Tesla (the guy overseeing all the human drivers) to go through one final test. I'm not going to spoil it, but anyone who's seen it should know what I'm talking about. Anyway, it's a 1 on 1 race through every single one of the dimensions, and the thing is that Vert doesn't have any acceletrons. So, it's his pure memorization and skill that he needs to speedrun through the entire Accelerace before time runs out.This game captures this perfectly.Almost every game, I imagine myself as Vert driving, nimbly avoiding all obstacles, using boosters to jump, and maintaining a rediculous high speed while knowing that one slip up could destroy me and my car.Additionally, in the series, there were always memorable moments of cars getting wiped out, flying out into rocks, smashing themselves off the road while the other cars kept it cool and just drove like life depended on it (which it did). There was even one scene where a car was lasered in half, and cars flying off the edge of the narrow track into oblivion. Sound familiar?Anyway, it was not the look or feel of the game so much as the fact that I had finally discovered an accurate representation of Acceleracers I had always been looking for. Whoever knows the show will be amazed at how many moments you've thought, ""wow, just like Acceleracers"", I know I have.Not many will know what it is though, I'm sure of that. But anyone who does, this is the game you've been waiting for.			",85,4,2,1,8,0,8

This game is excellent!First of all, this game is still in beta so if I wont talk to much about the game.PROSThere are five different gamply modes: Sprint (used for story more), Stunt, Tag and Soccer just to name a few. There are several diffrent features to this game (I haven't tried all of them only a few) VR, Track Editor, Trackmogify (Random Track Generator) and online play. The controls are incredibly responsive both on the keyboard and the controller (Logitech F310). Gameplay-wise the modes are diverse enough to be different, but similar enough that they are easy to pick up and play. The graphics with high graphic settings look absolutely beautiful. BUT BE WARNED, if you don't play on a very, Very, VERY, powerful computer, frame rate may be pretty bad if you play on a core i3 laptop in comparison.CONSWell, there isn't really a CONBut if there was, then I would say...Price.$19.99 might be a bit overpriced for you, it's not bad at all because of all the features tht are in the game. It's a good time to mention that Distance is a spiritual sequel to Nitronic Rush, an older game from 2011 by the same folks that made this game. (NR is Free BTW)OVERALLThis game is great, I personaly find this game to be just as good as NR. Price may be a bit much but, I can forgive since it's an indie game and Refract Studios deserves the money to make sure this game will be better than the Very Very Good Nitronic Rush.

								Absolutely fantastic. I loved Nitronic Rush and Team Nitronic (now Refract Studios) have definitely lived up to, and gone way past the fun and excitement of it with Distance. I've been in since the beta, and so far I've loved every bit of it.While this game is in early access, I highly recommend it even if the game never updates again (which it will by the way, Refract are cool guys)First, the level editor: Steam Workshop support and a built in level editor is a game changer for any game, and this one especially. The editors advanced features reminds me of such things as Autodesk Maya, but can be simplified down to the Portal 2 in-game map creator. Tracks in the editor snap together and can be automatically resized. They act like splines and the track automatically is generated along them, so you do not have to worry about that at all. Everything is very easy yet advanced at the same time which will make some really brilliant levels (and has already infact).Multiplayer: This was the most requested feature from Nitronic Rush, and they've implemented it right down to the core of the game. It is done extremely well and I couldn't ask for anything more (well, maybe auto downloading of workshop levels to clients who dont have). It's really fun with mates or strangers on any of the modes: sprint, speed and style, challenge and reverse tag (shame they removed the football gamemode though).Atmosphere: The atmosphere of the game is clear from the start and I think it works really well. There's less of the really bright colours from Nitronic and the announcer is gone (for now at least). The world is dark and gloomy but mixed with flashing lights and exciting music makes for an interesting yet enjoyable experience. The soundtrack itself is incredible, Torcht and the team really have outdone themselves this time, it's much better than Nitronic Rush's music (and for the record, I loved Nitronic Rush's music).There are only a few things that I think should be worked. The first is optional realtime portals, since right now they work like a static 360* image wrapped around it - but don't get me wrong they look great and aren't noticeable at high speeds, of course this should be off by default and as an advanced graphics option like realtime reflections since they would require a beefy GPU. Another thing would be mod support for custom gamemode types. My biggest issue currently is no mouse support at all, not even for menus - but I'm sure it's planned (we are in Early Access right now, after all), but these are more like feature requests than actual issues - and I'm certain Refract has more up their sleeve for us, so we'll see.Conclusion: Get this game if you love any of these:A. Arcade racersB. Splitscreen gamesC. Sci-Fi gamesD. RacersE. Playing tag with your friendsF. Games with an amazing soundtrackG. Calm drivingH. Exciting drivingI. Polished gamesJ. Multiplayer racing with friendsK. Multiplayer racing with not friendsL. Nitronic RushM. Ex-DigiPen studentsN. Refract StudiosOkay I'll stop now, but seriously, get this game - you will not regret it.			",258,39,4,16,46,5,26

								*WILL BE UPDATED AT FULL RELEASE*Distance is simply one of the best games on Early Access. The sequel to Nitronic Rush is fast, intense, and a joy to play.The graphics in this game are glorious. The tron-like style is perfect for this type of game and the amount of color on the screen is a treat for your eyes. The cars look great, with the ability to edit the car's color and glow - making each unique to the certain player when playing online. The graphics are also optimized well, making it run on lower-end machines. Distance at it's core is a survival racing game. Throughout the levels, you can do things like jump, boost, twist and fly. The levels have a directed path, but with the ability to fly - it adds an extra element of exploration and freedom. The game as of now has a strong amount of game modes. Adventure is Distance's story mode, it's short and doesn't really have a clear story; the levels are well designed and are fun. It's more so of a tutorial the first few levels which is good for those who have no clue what they are doing. In these levels, there are ramps, lasers, twisting roads, sawblades, and other things there to kill and confuse you. It requires a solid amount of skill, the boost has the ability to overheat and flying requires boost to actually use. It's a nice balance that doesn't feel restrictive. The sense of speed is fantastic, speeding past 3 lasers then twisting, dodging a pole and then flying over the sawblades just making it towards the regeneration checkpoint is exhilarating. There are also a bunch of other game modes as well - Sprint (time trial), Speed and Style (Time + Tricks), Challenge (Mini Challenge Levels), and Stunt (Tricks); there is also a reverse tag mode that I have yet to play. The amount of game modes are fresh and give players more to play. Lastly, is the integration of Steam Workshop. The community have already made some fantastic levels, one highlight is the replica of Rainbow Road from Mario Kart. The amount of levels and the quality of those are only going to grow. It's a match made in heaven. The audio is solid. It's sharp and clear. Where the game's sound shine though is the music. It immerses you in the game and only boosts the intense nature of the game. The controls are extremely smooth and responsive. I personally use a gamepad. If you do choose to use a gamepad, try using the triggers for both boost and jump as things can get awkward sometimes. With the amount of developer-made levels, gamemodes, online play, and community levels - there is tons to do already. The best part is, the game is going to keep on growing. If you live fast, survival racing games, you must get your hands on this. At $22 (CDN), it's a steal.

			Views: 529		

			Distance: Early Impressions Distance video created on version: Beta 3297 Distance is a pretty nifty arcade racer... ""Early Impression"" are impressions on early access games available on Steam.		

Distance features high quality visuals and audio, with a great sound track. The game is essentially an arcade racer that focuses on avoiding obstacles and quick reflexes. It has a lot of very interesting ideas and mechanics, including flight (yeah, your car can fly), interesting play on gravity (drive on walls and ceiling), and some environmental hazards that are quite unique in how they can affect your performance.The game excels at giving the player the sensation of speed, but also keeps him/her on their toes as the tracks are always littered with piles of hazards. When you first jump into Distance, some parts of the game may get frustrating at first, and your first flight will probably end in tragedy. There is a learning curve, but if you can get over that hump, this game can feel incredibly satisfying as you learn to needle thread through obstacles, and flipping your car just at the right moment, you'll find that ""holy ♥♥♥♥"" moment more than once.My only real complaint is how the game handles gravity some times. As mentioned previously, you can flip your car to drive on ceilings and walls, but the game some times doesn't know what to do with the car if you don't jump or flip exactly as the game wants you to. Instead of making a landing that looked perfectly reasonable, you fly off into the nether, then your car blows up... I hope the developers can make some adjustments in the future and tweak the gravity to be more consistent and user friendly.Distance is in Early Access, but unlike many in the same program Distance feels very complete. It already features a full and robust options and graphics settings, level editor with over 150 user made maps available already, local and online multiplayer, and multiple ways to play the campaign maps. Distance has raised the bar of what gamers can expect from early access games, and this is a good thing.Overall Distance is a very enjoyable arcade racer that will have you pulling your hair out one minute, and in the next, your nose will be touching the screen with focus and determination. It's a hell of a ride. Pros:- Great visuals and audio- Fast and visceral gameplay- Challenging- Tons of interesting ideas- Feels extremely complete for an early access (Beta 3297)Cons:- Gravity feels wonky at times- Can be frustrating at first			",1483,525,23,180,133,13,163

								Amazing racing game with tron-like graphics. It is a very fast paced racing game, where a second can be the difference between literally life and death. Your car can be damaged-sliced in half, dented, and more. Graphically wise, it can be quite pretty with neon lights all over. When played with friends or online the gameplay is amazing,  the competition fierce, but even when you lag behind you will be cheered on by the willing and watching crowd. Adventure mode is a nice introduction to the game. It also has an amazing level editor that is easy to use, allowing you to create hundreds of maps-just look at the workshop to see some creations. Music is one of the things that truly fits this type of game, think techno-beat meets trons daft punk, makes you want to hit the nitro for even longer.			",157,26,0,15,22,1,30

Early Access Review
Early Access review, FEB 15.Great graphics, cool presentation (like music-bass pulsating colors), awesome !!! music. It's a pretty fast racing game; easy to learn, hard to master. Good reflexes are a must. 4/5 Official tracks are really good. From easy tutorial-like tracks to weird and fast paced ground-ceiling-wall-avoid-jump-through-hole. They look great, stuff pulsates colorful to the beaty music. They usually take about 2-4 min. so great for ""just another map"" feeling :D Graphis is awesome. Although some effects are pretty performance consuming (e.g. car reflections), even with a mediocre pc it still looks cool. Big screen/tv is a plus since all the effects can sometimes make orientation a bit hard, especially when playing split screen MP. Controls are fine (no mouse support though, but I don't mind). You can customize them and even put one action to 2 different buttons, but I think the default settings are just working good. Best played with controller in my opinion (worked with xbox 360 controller instantly). Sound is, as title says, fu**** awesome! Great beats, everything is responsive to the track (which works even in MP!), which really improves imersion (if you can say that for a SciFi racing game :D). Nothing to add here. Just turn up the bass + volume! (yes the music in the steam shop video is also in game music) Stuff like ""gold medals"" is not really necessary imho - but every player gets a profile and you can check your local player and global ranking for every track. Nice for local MP with your friends, as you can always check who's the best on which track if you'd like. Some customization is possible: you can change your cars colors, like primary, secondary, glow and sparcle color. Gets saved to the profile, so every player can make his own colored car. Design is still always the same, though.If you like racing games and are playing MP (and don't necessarily need weapons like Mario Cart), get this gem right now.If you play singe player only, maybe wait a bit for more content or a sale, as currently you can ""see and do everything"" in a couple of hours (unless you're the type who has to lead every ranked table there is :D).Did not use the map creator.Did play with controller only.Did not play online MP, just split screen.

Quick Impressions: Initially the game feels kind of slow even when you have that blur-thing happening. But the first few stages are tutorials getting you accustomed to the game. Even though the game never actually gets any faster, the obstacles thrown in front of you creates a very real feeling of speed. Looking back at my LP, it does seem slow, but when I was playing, it was hectic.There is a nice magnetic grip to the car. It's not way overpowered, it's tuned very nicely and helps with all of the crazy go-nuts car flipping to perpendicular roadways. I've already seen some speed runs and I'm excited to see what comes of it.There are already UGC for the levels!  http://steamcommunity.com/app/233610/workshop/ Which is NUTS!  Really cool that there is so much UGC on day one when the game launches.  Easily has to be some kind of record. I toyed around with the level editor at the end of my LP and I have no idea what I'm doing, but it seems fairly simple after you get the hotkeys situated in your head.Lastly, I want to mention that there is a very real kernel of a story present in Distance.  Which is kind of odd, because you usually don't expect stories in racing games.  But something is definitely up.All told this game is precision racing.Excellent job from the Nitronic Rush guys!

								Anyone who's played the free game titled Nitronic Rush will feel right at home with Distance.  In fact, Distance is being developed as the spiritual successor (sequal) to Nitronic Rush.  And what a fantastic sequal it is.  Here are my opinions on the game as a Kickstarter backer (beta).Pros:-Superb graphics/environment.  The theme of the levels is fantastic (almost Tron-esque), and the music goes with the environment very well.  Light will pulse along with the music, and the overfall feeling is just fabulous.-Excellent handling.  The cars handle beautifully, and really are easy to drive but hard to master.  Mechanics such as boosting (which has a heating system a la Motorstorm), jumping, and flying are all implemented very well.  The levels often utilize these too, creating for a unique driving expirience.-Challenge.  Distance is fun for just your average racer, but it has a suprising depth for speedrunners.-Level editor.  Have not used this much personally, but you can see by other people's fantastic creations that it works well.Cons:-Content.  The game's in beta, so I can't be too harsh here.  However, at the time of writing this you can complete the story in an hour or so.  -Level editor.  While very robust, it's not particularly easy to use.  Tutorials can be found on Youtube; they help.If you enjoy racing games, challenging games, or speedrunning games I strongly recommend picking this up.  I have been anxiously awaiting this game since it was announced and it's been anything but dissapointing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Distance is an Early Access game that is really, well, going the distance. This review was written as of 11/12/14. the game may have changed since then. As a spiritual successor to Nitronic Rush, one of my favourite racing/driving games, I imagine it will be great when it's finished. Heck, it's great right now.The story isn't done yet, but some of the elements I've seen in its current state are very promising. The level design in this is pretty good so far, but I feel most of the levels are tutorial-level of difficulty. It would be good to see the next levels added have a higher difficulty.I've tested this with an xbox controller, and keyboard/mouse. Both seem to do the job well, but I do hope they add mouse support for menus sometime soon.The graphics in this game look pretty amazing in their current state.The soundtrack in this game is great, and if it is going to be in any way similar to nitronic Rush, it can only get better.This game supports the workshop, so once more people good with game design get on board  in the community you can be sure there won't be a shortage of levels to play.While this is an early access game, I do feel that the developers have proven themselves to be very competent and not just in it for a money grab. They dd private betas beforehand, and have already developed Nitronic Rush. I'm looking forward to the final product. ",171,91,5,6,15,0,12

Early Access Review
								Distance is quite easily the best Early Access game I have played in the last two years.There is one simple reason behind this: IT WORKS!TLDR OR SEE MY VIDEO BELOW : Distance is a fast paced time trial racer, it has a few different modes available and is opened up to Single player, multiplayer and split screen LAN multiplayer.There are plenty of unique and interesting official maps to keep you busy, but if you set the best times on these there is the extensive community workshop with over 200+ tracks (from date of writing) available to download separately (or all at once).Compete against friends or the global community to try and dominate the leaderboards. ------ FULL REVIEW ------ Adventure Mode:The game sports an adventure mode where you race your car through the official maps in as quick a time as possible while avoiding all the crazy lasers, buzz saws and twisting and winding roads while preventing your car from overheating by quickly getting through the next checkpoint.Although there isn't a story per se the tracks are highly immersive and draw you into what can only be classified as a dystopian city scape. Throughout the adventure you seem to move from a potentially busy vibrant city into a dark lost society. If you put your imagination to it I am sure you can come up with some interesting scenarios as to what happened to this world!Arcade:Arcade mode is where it really gets interesting. There are a few modes to choose from:Sprint: Basically get to the end of the track as quickly as possible to get your name on the global scoreboards. Go through checkpoints to prevent the car from overheating. Reset if you screw up too badly and push yourself to the limit to gain the fastest time possible! (this mode counts towards global leaderboards).Stunt: Try to do as many flips, flights and wall rides as possible within the time limit to gain the greatest score. This is played in an arena mode with plenty of ramps and heights to get the maximum amount of flips in before that inevitable landing, just be sure to land upright or the subsequent landing may be more of an explosion!Reverse Tag: There is an orb which must be collected. Each player will compete to steal the orb from the other player. Whoever can keep the orb for the longest time will win. This is played in an arena style map which has plenty of cheeky little areas to try and trip your competitors up.Workshop:From the date of writing there are over 200 community created tracks to try out. There are different tracks designed for each individual mode. Each track varies in length and difficulty with some sprints taking less than a minute, to first time tries clocking in at over 10 minutes.One problem with the workshop currently is everyone must have downloaded the community maps themselves, they don't just download from the host. There is however a quick solution to this on the workshop with a ""subscribe to all mods"" tool which allows you to instantly subscribe to all the tracks available.Track Editor:The game ships with its own in game track editor which provides all the tools you need to create some really exciting / wacky tracks which you can then upload to the Steam workshop and let others race and rate. There is massive room for some truly exciting and unique track experiences.Leaderboards:The leaderboards are what help to make this game what it is. You can see times set by the top 1000 in the global community but also filter down to personal best times and friends. If like me you want to be at the top of your friends leaderboards you should definitely give this game a try!Controller:The front of Steam says the game has partial controller support although while using my Xbox controller it seemed to work 100% fine, I was able to re-bind keys however I liked, vibration function works no problems.If you prefer to use the keyboard then this is fine too, again it has 100% re-bind capabilities.---------  CONCLUSION ---------As mentioned at the start this is the best Early Access I have played in a long time. It works flawlessly without any crashes and very few if any bugs. One issue I have noticed is when watching another person finish a race it can get stuck playing the same loop, however this isn't game breaking and when they finish / the timer runs out the game will continue as usual.One small problem with the community maps is every person wanting to race online must have individually downloaded the maps. They don't download from the host. There is however a quick solution to this on the workshop with a ""subscribe to all mods"" tool which allows you to instantly subscribe to all the tracks available.The game is still in beta and already I would say 8.5/10 I can't give it more because the adventure mode is not yet finished and the issues with online downloading of maps. But it is well on its way to becoming a fantastic game which could give hours of fun and frustration!

								This is an oddball. I purchased this on a whim during the Christmas sale and was pleasantly surprised. This is a small Alpha version of a high octane Wipeouty influenced alternate dystopian reality racer. Whew. Honestly I have no idea what it is. It's basically an insanely fast racer where twitch reflexes reign supreme. The game itself is quickly easy to master and theres only one car that comes in a few different colors. The official track selection is rather small too but theres a massive amount of great user made tracks free for download on the Steam Workshop.To be honest the creators rarely ever update this game, and I honestly never see this coming out of early access but it's a cheap thrill to be had and an okay overall experience. I wouldn't pay over $10USD for it though. Buy it on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The best learning experience i've ever had in any game, was with distance. No only was i forced to go the distance, but i stood up and screamed so many times in excitement and pure adrenaline going holy ♥♥♥♥ did that just happen so that's what those lasers do, spinning saws, who would have thought it actually would cut me in half, wait. i can still keep driving? Alright, lets see if i can make it a uni wheeled car and find out the distance i can travel that way. This games ""campaign"", more like 12 mission tutorial, teaches you something new every mission, every song, every km/mi. It truly does take you the distance of learning what racing games should have been. But travel no further, because this one is it. The best part is the learning doesn't stop in the campaign, with the fully featured workshop and level editor you too can create your own maps, like a 50 second speed run when you constantly have to jump off walls, fly through space and of course, i know super cheesy, travel the distance. So look no further, and set up that steering wheel and paddle box, *Don't forget to set up correct controls in settings!"" Because this is the game that will take you to outter space and back. Something something it'll bring you the distance you desire. 12/10 Most fun i have ever had in a racing game. 2/10 wish the soundtrack was real, and no midi files on loop. Amazing work with them that way though, love that you pulled it off. :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Distance is a really good racing game. The car handles really well in both driving and flying mode, and gives you the chance to learn new techniques in order to improve your track times. The base game comes with a kinda limited amount of tracks, but thankfully the steam workshop contains many excellent new ones.If you like time trials and leaderboards, this game will have you constantly retrying the same track over and over till you set the best time you can, only for you to then realise that track is just a guideline through the course, making you have to learn a whole new route to get gud.

								The most satisfying driving experience I’ve ever had in a game. The movements and stunts are fluid and quick to respond to input. The levels are creative and atmospheric, and definitely one of the most fun driving games I’ve played in a long time. One of the first games I’ve gone back to beat previous time records on. An elaborate level editor that is sure to increase the games lifespan exponentially. Can’t wait for the adventure mode to be finished. As far as the actual game’s progress goes: the game is there, it just needs more levels which are in the works. Some graphic settings are unoptimized and effect frame rate greatly, including particle and lighting effects around large amounts of hazardous obstacles that have such effects on them.

								Lasers, buzz-saws and grinders, oh my! This game reminds me of Kinetica, a 2001 futuristic racer for the ps2 with an emphasis on deadly tracks and racer stunts. If you've played and loved Kinetica, or either of those two aspects appeal to you, this game will not disappoint. So far its an interesting little racing game that has a lot going for it in its early state. Overall, the racing mostly relies on quick reactions, a general understand of how fast you're moving, and boost/heat/flight energy management. The game is simple enough that its easy to learn the controls and get started, but a few tracks into single player and you'll realize just how much you have to master (especially if you want to play online or gold medal the arcade modes). It is currently a little light on dev created content, but the community is filling in the gaps for now. The single player campaign is about 40 min, and obviously incomplete, but it already has some interesting story telling methods and lore that its begging to set up. In short, I think this game is totally worth your money, especially if you want to help the devs bring this game to fruition.			",60,19,0,4,10,2,8

								It's fast, it's fun. Art and music remind me a lot of Tron, speed reminds me a lot of F-Zero. Definitely recommended for people who like speedy racing games.I do wish you could get more than one car model. It's sleek, and you can customize the colors, but there's only one.As more tracks and things are added, it can only get better. Definitely keep an eye on it if you like racing.

								Great successor to Nitronic Rush, visuals and soundtrack is superb, it has an easy-to-use level editor and it also has workshop support.This game has a fairly simple learning curve and both keyboard and controller are viable options.I would reccomend to those who are fans of fast paced futuristic racing games.

However, sometimes it's difficult to handle the challenges right away.

								An amazing game! Distance is oozing with style. Fantasic art, clever game mechanics - boost, jumps and even flying is incorporated enabling you to stunt in order to survive the visually incredible and thoughtful crafted maps with their changes of gravity and obstacles (including razors and lasers trying to cut you in bits at times). The gameplay is absolutely fluent and real fun using a controller, very responsive.There are different game modes;  Adventure (sort of campaign) and Arcade with sprint, speed & style, challenge and stunt, offering solo, split screen and online playOfc there is also a level editor and lots of custom maps already available.And not to forget the great soundtrack. Fits perfectly.A great way to test and train your reflexes. The first maps are easy and introduce you to the gameplay, and the later expert ones are pretty challenging, if you wanna get a good score and a gold medal. ;)Before I forget: I haven't encountered any bugs so far, so no worries about its early access state.

Stunning visuals amazing music, if you like the type of racing game with an futuristic-style or a TRON style this is your game.The game is also well optimized, it runs smoothFor 9.99 is worth the price.

								Imagine you have a boring normal car. Now you get to paint your car whatever colors you want. Might as well throw in a back booster and the ability to jump. Now add in some lasers, crushers and buzz saws and scatter them all around an alien world straight outta space. Track is gone? Oh well, might as well drive on the walls - maybe even pull off a sweet trick while you're at it. Falling towards your demise because you just totally failed that triple backflip? Well admire the beautiful scenery and pretty lights, then open up your WINGS and fly back up to try and survive just a little bit longer. Yes, that thing IS trying to kill you.			",42,11,6,4,4,0,0

								Sci-fi Arcade racing at its best since the golden age of gaming. Distance has a fantastic theme, bringing Tron-esque styles to twisting tracks, gravity swapping jumps and devastating obstacles that can literally leave you with a small portion of your car left to scrape over the finish line (or check point), regenerating it ready to go.The music, style, graphics and controls all feel very well polished and add a great atmosphere to the game and while the campaign is not massively in-depth, it is not yet finished and does give a decent challenge to new and veteran players alike.The level creator is a well-built and friendly tool that allows anyone to easily create their own levels to share and is one of the best level editors I have seen in a while.Overall, very fun alone or with friends, with different online modes to keep you entertained.Highly recommended even if you are not really a racing fan, definitely worth the price.

This game is overall good, not too many things that ruin it. Get it if you like games that are crazy, fun, and awesome.Time Posted: June 29th, 2016 9:44 PM			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Although still in development, this game is awesomeIf you liked Hotwheels' Acceleracers or anything like that as a kid, you'll love every second of this high-speed, frantic, very well made game.The graphics are on point, as well as the dynamic soundtrack. There is still only one car option, although customizable color-wise, but they'll eventually add more I suppose, as it was with Nitronic Rush.The levels are always fun to sprint and trick through, and the later ones WILL be challenging. No matter what your skill level with racing games is.You'll see that I've not played that many hours of the game on steam, but that's because I've already played a ♥♥♥♥-ton of it through unofficial means, and finally decided to show my support and gratitude to the developers.TL;DR: The game is awesome, has pretty good compatibility and is definitely underrated, GO PLAY IT! :^)			",68,4,0,7,4,0,1

								Played the campaign mode. In its current beta state it clocks in at under an hour, which is short. But nevermind that. It's just so much fun. Perfectly tuned, super easy to get into, kick ♥♥♥ music -- and then it started throwing more and more extreme mechanics at me, and every time the grin on my face got bigger. YEAH ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Best Game Ever.Pros- Graphics are amazing- Level design is outstanding- Soundtrack is amazing (don't like it? Add Your Own Music!)- Playable with both Keyboard and Mouse, but a controller is best- Amazing physics and easy to navigate menusCons- Still Early Access- Not to many updates (few and far between)- Multiplayer Lobbies are often non existant (but if you have some friends that also own the game, you can create a Private Match to play)- VERY STEEP learning curve It's truly a amazing game, but the levels are difficult (except for starter levels), the game is often Hectic, and it can be frustrating. This game is overall good, not too many things that ruin it. Get it if you like games that are crazy, fun, and awesome.Time Posted: June 29th, 2016 9:44 PM			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Although still in development, this game is awesomeIf you liked Hotwheels' Acceleracers or anything like that as a kid, you'll love every second of this high-speed, frantic, very well made game.The graphics are on point, as well as the dynamic soundtrack. There is still only one car option, although customizable color-wise, but they'll eventually add more I suppose, as it was with Nitronic Rush.The levels are always fun to sprint and trick through, and the later ones WILL be challenging. No matter what your skill level with racing games is.You'll see that I've not played that many hours of the game on steam, but that's because I've already played a ♥♥♥♥-ton of it through unofficial means, and finally decided to show my support and gratitude to the developers.TL;DR: The game is awesome, has pretty good compatibility and is definitely underrated, GO PLAY IT! :^)			",68,4,0,7,4,0,1

Refract have nailed the difficulty just right for a player like me. I am looking forward to coming back and playing the story mode. The developers are clearly committed to making this game awesome and updates have been regular. It's a super shiny and fun game, and well worth buying even at this stage.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Like many, I had played Nitronic Rush, a game developed by the creators of Distance as a college project. And, like many, I fell in love with the sense of speed and control, as well as the impressive attention to quality these unpaid students had shown. If you are not sure about purchasing Distance, I urge you to try Nitronic Rush first. Now on to the review, which will be in simple slices from this point on:Gameplay:+Great sense of speed+Wow factor very high+Ability to be stylish+Extremely hectic but fun and skill based multiplayer-Occasional Gravity quips, but mostly as solid as nitronic rushGraphics:+Stunning enviornments+Great in motion or a still screenshot+Stylized world portrays the mood of the adventure mode well. Speaking of which...Story:+A visual adventure with great portrayal  of mood+Still in beta, so improvements and overall increase in narrative are likely+Music conveys most of the messageMusic:+I love it+You want more explanation? Okay+Electronica, progressive house, and dubstep fused together.+Sound good?+You betLasting appeal:+Workshop support for hundreds of levels+Still in beta, expect more content!-As of now, lacking enough to keep you busy for more than a couple days. Will improve with time most likelyOverall, team Nitronic (Now known as Refract Studios) is raising the standard for the racing genre.Much like Sonic the Hedgehog gave the platformer genre a faster, fresher experience to the platformer genre, Distance is the new way to experience the high speed thrills of a racing game.The Distance Beta gets a whopping9/10 for Pre ReleaseAnd a predicted10/10 GoTY for 2015 racing enthusiasts.

It can be a bit daunting because the gameplay is centered around reflex in some areas but once you get into the zone and master driving it gets easier. The first person view is even crazier than the third person and personally I find it easier to control my car, from the first person view, even though having spacial awareness from this view is a bit difficult. All in all it's a awesome game. The music gets you pumped once it gets going. I feel like this game is a hell child born from a threesome Rocket League(with it's car jumping mechanics and boosts), Burnout(because it's the only game I can recall that's environment could really bone you over) and Tron.9/10 Would crash into lasers again.

								This game still misses a lot. It's more of the concept, than a finished game.But it's really fun. Pure arcade. This game gives you some kind of a supercar with player-friendly vehicle physics and some crazy tracks to drive. Your car can jump, drive on walls even fly. It can regenerate instantly when you're passing the green checkpoint even after being cut in half with a laser. And there are a lot of lasers, razor discs and other stuff, that wants to cut, smash or burn your car. And a lot of places to do some crazy stunts.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Trackmogrify gives you an infinite number of tracks so you're never gonna be bored with this.

								I´m recommending this game, even thinking the game looks abandoned, because I think the price versus the content that the game already have, worth it. I said abandoned because it has being passed more than 3 months since the last update. In my opinion, for an early access game, it is too much. But I don't follow the developers, maybe they are planning to release a big update in the near future. Anyway just keep in mind that this game does not receive updates too often.One more thing to consider before buy it is: when I said that the content worth, is mainly because of the modes that allows you to play with your friends. But I do not recommend for whose are just interested in Single Player mode, at current stage it is too short and incompleted, although it is fun and promising.Hope this help.			",184,38,14,8,15,0,15

								I find it crazy how such a good game is so below the radar. For only $20 you get a bunch of amazing tracks from the Workshop to sink your time into thanks to the great community this game has. It's a fun and thrilling experience with a great soundtrack and multiple game modes to choose from like Sprint, Stunt mode and the work in progress Adventure/story mode. The game looks stunning as well with it's sci-fi theme while at the same time not being too demanding on your computer. The only gripe I have is the fact that it has such a small playerbase so you'd have to hop on the weekends when they hold play sessions to find people online easier. Which is a shame since it's not the game's fault, just not really a well known title on steam : / On the good news, that doesn't affect people who just want to chill and survive the tracks/get the best times on their own. For a game that offers more content than a AAA title (thanks to the workshop/community content) it's certainly worth the price.			",96,9,3,7,13,2,11

								This game is best played with good headphones, in the dark and without stress. It just lets you in and you don't for a moment feel like driving, rather gliding along. The graphics are clean yet beautiful, the sound is perfectly balanced and everything... just works together. There isn't a thing I would like to add to this game other than a few more levels, but even being short it has great replay value to me. I can see myself playing it whenever I feel like being... chill.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The best learning experience i've ever had in any game, was with distance. No only was i forced to go the distance, but i stood up and screamed so many times in excitement and pure adrenaline going holy ♥♥♥♥ did that just happen so that's what those lasers do, spinning saws, who would have thought it actually would cut me in half, wait. i can still keep driving? Alright, lets see if i can make it a uni wheeled car and find out the distance i can travel that way. This games ""campaign"", more like 12 mission tutorial, teaches you something new every mission, every song, every km/mi. It truly does take you the distance of learning what racing games should have been. But travel no further, because this one is it. The best part is the learning doesn't stop in the campaign, with the fully featured workshop and level editor you too can create your own maps, like a 50 second speed run when you constantly have to jump off walls, fly through space and of course, i know super cheesy, travel the distance. So look no further, and set up that steering wheel and paddle box, *Don't forget to set up correct controls in settings!"" Because this is the game that will take you to outter space and back. Something something it'll bring you the distance you desire. 12/10 Most fun i have ever had in a racing game. 2/10 wish the soundtrack was real, and no midi files on loop. Amazing work with them that way though, love that you pulled it off. :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I've had an eye on this since I first found Nitronic Rush ages ago, and only finally broke down and bought it when I caught it in the Humble Store's sale for half off.It's absolutely wonderful, to say the least.The driving handles infinitely better than in Nitronic Rush, at least in my experience, remaining familiar enough that I grasped it without problem. The soundtrack is as brilliant as that of its predecessor, leaving me searching for a place to purchase or download it.There are many other things here that I could go on about, but I needn't.

								This is the best racing game ever. Period. Nothing else even comes close.There is a ton of community content, and more being created constantly, meaning that there is a basically unlimited number of levels to play. The game's community is super awesome, from Speedy Saturdays (a group multiplayer event that happens every Saturday), to the forums, to the subreddit. The workshop has tons of levels for all the game modes. The game has leaderboards, and people try to get the highest time on the global leaderboards, sometimes involving insanely hard skips through parts of the level.The game has Split Screen and Online multiplayer, both of which work extremely well. The split screen multiplayer has the option to split both horizontally or vertically when playing with only two players. The online multiplayer works extremely well, even with a super high (2-3 second) latency.The devs are quick to respond to reported bugs, and there is an experimental branch that is updated very frequently, containing the newest bug fixes and content.The game is very supporting of all types of controllers, from the Xbox 360 controller, to the keyboard, to joysticks. It is super easy to customize the controls to work exactly how you want them to. The game seems to detect and have default settings for all the controllers that I've thrown at it.I very much recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a fun racing game, to play by themselves or with friends. Distance is fun, competitive, fast-paced, and full of action. I don't believe that there is a better racing game in the world right now.Oh and also, ♥♥♥♥ grip.			",34,16,4,1,13,1,3

								Not 100% sure about the $20 price-tag. But I'm damn sure this is worth the sale price I got it for. I've only got 7.5 hours so far, but I'm going to enjoy this game for a long time. The community levels/support is probably what will keep this game fresh for me even longer than the SFRUSH series (back in muh day). The game is very polished as I would expect for something that's been ""out"" for 2 years. One complaint I have is the slightly lazy turning physics... at extremely low speeds the turning radius for the car is absurdly huge which makes recovering from a slide into a wall much more arduous and difficult than it needs to be. The only other whinging I can do is over lack of styling/car choices. It'd be nice to have more vehicle choices (preferably with limited tunable stats to suit play-style/track-specific setups).

								May be an early access game but it's already put together really well. Better than some games that are no longer early access but still have bugs. They warn you some of their areas of the game are still under development and to let them know if you find a bug. But so far so good - for me at least, including in those areas. There is no other game out there like this (as far as I know). It's original in what it does and the environments it offers. Plus I was blown away by the number of mods people have already put together for it! It just shows how much love is already out there for this game. But even without the mods, there is still so much to explore and try out with the game itself. Love the visuals, the colors, the handling of the car. I'll add more feedback later as I explore further and play more. But so far it was worth the price (I paid full price).			",73,24,8,5,4,0,1

								Fantastic level design, high speed tracks that are essentially puzzles, very fitting music, workshop support, being able to mess up so hard that you fly off the track and are able to explore the geometry and even possibly recover, physics based vehicle damage, and a very nice looking cel shading. The only flaw I have is that the Nightmare levels seem a bit out of place. The ending of Adventure mode stating that more levels coming is great. I love games that seemingly break your hardware, but don't really.Edit: After owning the game for over a month, the developer is constantly updating and improving the game. This is a great example of early access working.			",231,13,1,13,13,1,7

								Current Edit:  Having put a few hours into Distance, I can safely say my money was worth it, but for reasons many others may not benefit from, but hopefully a few may.   I suffer pretty severly from panic attacks (often leading to mild seizures) from time to time, mostly at night after dreaming about situations more ♥♥♥♥ed up than Im willing to describe.  I wake up sweating, my chest in a vice, diaphram contorted demonically, mind racing, heart about to explode...  I stumble out of bed, into my chair and manage to flick on my audio interface, boot up my computer and log in to steam.   Distance only takes a few moments to start and the music is soothing.  I always start with the first track, I forget the name... Broken Symmetry?  Regardless, the slow build up of piano, filter-modulated white/pink noise and easy curves wittle away at my stress.  Upon finding a sense of calm, meditative trance begins to set in.  The beat kicks up and I find myself no longer panicking, but positively charged, ready for challenge. My adrenaline flips polarity to positive and I am back to being ME.  No worries, no stress, no job, no lonliness.  Just pretty lights and sounds, a simple goal, and a sense of peace.  I have not tried any workshop tracks, but I would love to see something in the form of straightaway tracks like the first few, with little challenge and more empahsis on cinematic thrill.Initial Review-------Playing this game is what I imagine driving a Tesla might feel like.Sexiest sight/sound match in a racing game since Extreme GAdventure needs to be more.. erm, adventerous... I loved the build up intro but it was the same as arcade otherwise.  Maybe there could be some enemy responsible for the obstacles, cliche but it would be cool to have some depth. I would also love to see some sort of upgrade system or at least some aesthetic customization, it would make 20 dollars seem acceptable.  I got it on sale at 15 and it's still a stretch of money at this point in the development, that being said I do not regret the purchase at all.Will update.			",112,11,1,8,5,0,9

								I haven't taken the time to review that many games in the past, however, this game was too good to pass up giving attention.Its been awhile since arcade racers were in their prime. People are lost to the unrealistic stupid fun genre that is arcade racers, Distance by Refract Studios didn't only remind me of that same rediculous fun I used to have in arcades, but grew on it in so many wonderful ways.in 2011 the small indie studio released Nitronic Rush, a fun experiment using a physics engine built entirely by them in C++, and it was awesome. I got my friends to download it and they all loved it, it was such a refresher from the generic races that have been coming out in years past, the ammount of insanity involved is something I hadn't dealt with in a long time.Then came Distance, made by the same studio under the name Refract, and it gave me that same rush as the first game. The game has cars going at a rediculous speed, set in a world similar to that of Tron, with flying cars, stunts, an amazing multiplayer and one of the most challenging but entertaining single player's i've been offered in a long time.If you're on the edge about this game, just know you wont be dissapointed, Distance is one of the most refreshing experiences i've had in a long time, and im confident Refract Studios can only make it better.

								This game is such a great concept racer. The track maker is very well done and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. It is lacking on content however. As far as early access games go, Distance exceeds expectations. I fully recommend it for a fast paced and colorful experience			",178,31,4,18,12,3,12

Early Access Review
								So far through the early access the game is great. It has cool physics, looks fantastic and awesome music. It leaves me wanting for more of a story mode that is not avliable at the time of writing the review. (7/18/2016). The game also has a functioning multiplayer which works great and syncs very well with people online. The steam workshop for custom tracks is awesome as people have made tons of maps (wether they are good or not is up to you). The game has potential but it needs to be further expanded. The Devs seem to be here and enjoy what they are doing. So i would expect further updates.(Quick side note, it has virtual reality support so you can go first person in the car while you drive which is cool AF lol, like driving a futuristic car in a hotwheels crazy world. You can also drive in first person mode while not having any virtual reality equipment but i dont think it would be as cool) If you have ever seen the TV/Movie series ""Hot Wheels Highway 35"" and ""Hot Wheels The Acceleracers movies 1-4"" . It feels as if it were inspired by the movies as it has similar car design choice and level design. But that just may be a complete  coincidence. This is just a positive note from my side it makes the game feels nostalgic in a way because i watched the movies as a kid.			",150,13,9,15,5,2,12

								I just picked this game up on sale and have currently played for less than an hour. I jumped straight into the adventure mode. Wow. What a wild ride. The controls are tight, the game loods spectacular (especially at 21:9), and I was dodging, flying, flipping, and being restored while having a blast. There are some awesome concepts going on here and I am totally behind seeing this game at its final form. My only regret is not purchasing sooner and at full price.Also, I would like to give a shoutout to Instant Noodles because they have helped me out too.			",131,16,4,8,23,2,21

								As of this review, i have put 21 hours into the game, and plan on putting many, many more on it. It reminds me alot of Trackmania, with fast-paced racing involving a time trial system.Pros; Beautiful, Runs well on my 8gb of ram and radeon 6950, Music is really good. Physics add a fun element to multiplayer, The color pallete is gorgeous (reminds me so much of tron), Multiplayer has a variety of modes for your enjoyment, Steam Workshop maps :D, level editor, Car customization (colors, lights), ect. Cons: Campaign is unfinished (however, they spent most of their time improving the gameplay). Flight control with a controller is somewhat hard to get the hang of (keyboard controls are great). To be honest there isn't much else i can complain about. It's an extremely well made game, and I personally have not encountered any bugs or errors.I would rate 9/10, Distance overall is better than most fully released games,			",102,10,5,7,20,0,13

Early Access Review
								The futuristic racing game scene is dead as can be and me being an old fan of the genre (who loved titles like Wipeout and Extreme-G), my hopes were high for this one.  This is the only early access game I've ever purchased and in spite of that, it still manages to deliver an amazing experience.  I have no idea what the story is behind the game and if you're like me then you'd rather not know simply because the sci-fi wasteland environment the game provides is so immersive that so you'll end up creating your own story in your head.  The electronic soundtrack is exactly what you'd expect: gritty, pounding tech-house that totally puts you in the game.  As for the controls, I played with an XBox gamepad and it worked perfectly with that.  Complaints?  When you shift to drive on the ceiling, it can some times be rather 50/50 on whether or not it works.  Suggestions?  Well, assuming multiplayer is in the works, and the fact that there's already a booming custom map community, I would say let me customize my ride!  But enough of all that, the game is damn good.  So turn the lights out, the music up and get ready for one hell of a ride!			",166,19,2,22,2,2,16

								***OPEN BETA REVIEW***A fantatically designed game. The graphics are absolutely beautiful, and all the neon cityscapes that the game generates are honestly eye-boggling. The driving controls feel very smooth and easy to learn - the tough part is mastering it and beign able to maneuver the vehicle through some ridiculously hectic and action-packed tracks. Soundtrack is quite good, actually, very fitting, and all the lights actually pulse to the music with a certain setting turned on. You can even give the game a directory, and it will play any MP3 music files you have there instead of the EDM/dubstep norm. Very creative and awesome special effects and innovative ideas I've never seen brought into the racing videogame world until now, including a gamemode that randomly generates a track and environment based on a random phrase that you input. This product is very well-polished, ESPECIALLY for a beta. All it's really missing is content. I got this game on sale, but I am almost positive that it will be well-worth the $20-asking price on its full release.			",83,4,0,3,2,0,2

								Even though I've played for only half an hour I can see the potential on this game and I want to play more and bring friends on to this boat, BUT, there is only one thing bothering me... As an avid flight simulator player the flight controls are just so wrong that i keep crashing everywhere, the pitch and turning controls are all messed up, Im used to roll and pitch ""up"" to go to the sides (eg, i want to go right, i roll 90º right and then press the pitch up button wich will make me turn right) instead I go UP and that confuses my ace wannabe brain. I tried several  controls config with no success. If im configuring it wrong please tell me. if not I request to ""fix/add"" this feature to the flight controls.			",63,6,2,13,13,0,5

								One of the most entertaining things ive played in a very long time. the game is as challengeing as you want it to be. the level desingers are absolutely nuts making levels that are nearly imposible witout perfect execution or more forgiving levels for the more adventurous. levels desinged to mezmerize you and hipnotize you. Levels that look like the batman 1990s animated series. Levels that play out like a horror game even down to the jumspacares of that ♥♥♥♥ing hexagon. its an amazing game, a great creative tool and the music is quite nice too.

								This game is very interesting, none the less. Even if your taste is not in racing games, it is a good pass time if you're overwhelmed from playing that Multiplayer game you typically play when you wake up in the morning. God knows when I am annoyed after playing Rust or Counter Strike: Global Offensive that it's these games I like to turn to. Overall, Distance has very many wonderful mechanisms to it. Gravity being a very affected party of this game; you need to understand how the physics of this game works if you want to play it properly. Once you get the hang of everything, however, you start to receive a lot of enjoyment out of playing the maps that are preset in the game, and even custom ones made by the community. Not only does Distance have wonderful mechanics to it, but it also has a nice developmental structure to it, and what I mean by that is it includes its own level editor, and you can make maps, such as a Rainbow Road and a Mario Kart map I've already took the liberty of playing on. I can say that this game is very enjoyable as a ""I have spare time and I'm not doing too much,"" type of game. Almost like listening to music or watching Netflix while you're idling in your game server trying to get rid of that TF2 item you don't like.The only problem I have with this game is the Multiplayer. You have to set up your own server and typically invite people to your game, because there are not a lot of random public servers to play on. They are all typically private for friends or a group of people. If they had a matchmaking feature like Left 4 Dead 2 does, then that would make Multiplayer a bit more appealing in my eyes.Overall, I do enjoy this game, and hope that it's carried out in development further than what it is now.Wonderful potential here, just don't end up like a lot of other Early Access games that are, very unfortunately, ""In early access"" for two and a half years and never actually goes anywhere often. Yes, that was a shot at DayZ. Sorry!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Very creative and awesome special effects and innovative ideas I've never seen brought into the racing videogame world until now, including a gamemode that randomly generates a track and environment based on a random phrase that you input. This product is very well-polished, ESPECIALLY for a beta. All it's really missing is content. I got this game on sale, but I am almost positive that it will be well-worth the $20-asking price on its full release.			",83,4,0,3,2,0,2

								Distance is a really fun game and has you dodging and diving between objects to reach your final goel. the adventure mode has a great experiance that will push you and challenge you to start with, once you have mastered that, sadly there is not musch else to challenge you besides the workshop. This does not mean there is no more content because oh boy is there more content. there are random geniration maps so that is infinate fun and also challenge mode and user maps, so yeah there is a lot.BUT the game really leaves me craving more speed and more split secound decisions. i really feel that they should make the tracks a tiny bit wider and add more speed and faster handeling later on in the game. i love the game and i love the small challenges it offeres but at the moment after playing it for a little while i feel i have mastered it and i just really want more speed and variation.TLDRGame is fun with a lot of contentfun to get good at, can bore when masteredneeds more speed with better handeling (only add better handeling if more speed is added)limited variationshort tracksIm going to give this game a thumbs up, because i really enjoy it and its great fun to play, i just feel that it has the possibility to be a great deal better if it was made harder with longer tracks and more speed.

								I just picked this game up on sale and have currently played for less than an hour. I jumped straight into the adventure mode. Wow. What a wild ride. The controls are tight, the game loods spectacular (especially at 21:9), and I was dodging, flying, flipping, and being restored while having a blast. There are some awesome concepts going on here and I am totally behind seeing this game at its final form. My only regret is not purchasing sooner and at full price.Also, I would like to give a shoutout to Instant Noodles because they have helped me out too.			",131,16,4,8,23,2,21

Distancetl;dr: A good racing game, a bit shortThe full review: Distance is a futuristic survival racing game, in which you try to race to the end of each level without being obliterated by the ever so many threats. All in all, I believe the developers did quite a good job at delivering.However, it still feels a little too focussed on racing and not enough on survival, which I would like to have seen more.As for Early Access: The Adventure Mode is indeed a little on the short side (about 1 hour of playtime), but it was definitely fun and quite mysterious - as the game gives you very little narrative. Who are you? Why are you racing? What is the corruption?In general, if you like racing games like TrackMania, you will likely enjoy playing this game!			",172,24,2,13,19,1,19

								The game is really fun. It's basically about Racing through a track with a futuristic car that can not only drive, but fly. The game itself has amazing graphics and usually performs really well. I almost always have over 60FPS on my R9 290. It may run a little bit laggy on weak systems though.Also, for an early access game, this one works really well. It's not plagued by bugs. Sure, there may be some minor ones, but after all, the fact that lets you know for sure it's early access is the title screen that says ""BETA"".EDIT: Play this game on shrooms. I ♥♥♥♥ing dare you.

								Distance is a mysterious, neon styled racing game set in space, somewhere above earth a long time from now. The general goal is to reach the finish, go fast and avoid various hazards on your way. Your space car comes equipped with a nitro boost that refills when landing stunts or driving through checkpoints, a set of wings that also use your boost meter to fly and a killer suspension system that makes sharp turns and airborne maneuvering easy. The stunt game mode deviates from this general goal as you only rely on GOOD STUFF like doing as many ASTOUNDING stunts as possible in a set amount of time to get you GOIN' THE DISTANCE. Distance is still in early access but it's already perfectly playable, there just aren't many official levels yet. However, thanks to the level editor and Steam Workshop, you currently have 885 custom made levels at your disposal... plenty of gameplay. So far I've tried several of the higher rated ones and they were all great.There's also a neat Transmogrify game mode that creates a random map based on what you write. Try ""super long never ending ride"". Spoiler alert: it ends and it's not even that long but it's got a great, sinister atmosphere about it. Everything fits.The kicking soundtrack fits the game perfectly. There's also an option to import and listen to your own music while you play. There are a lot of options.That said, I have a few minor complaints. I think the beatbox sound mode would be better if there was no screen shake and just a bigger emphasis on the blinking lights. I also miss the over the top announcer from Distance's predecessor - Nitronic Rush. I understand that the game is a bit more serious, lonesome and mysterious this time around. In fact, I really dig the whole space neon-machine atmosphere but If they added the announcer as an off by default or at least stunt mode only audio option, that'd just make the game BETTER THAN SLICED BREAD.

								Distance feels like a game that should have been around for decades. If it had been a contemporary of WipEout it might have shared that game's halcyon techno and Designer's Republic aesthetic. Instead Distance soaks in retro cyberpunk, floating Brutalist monoliths with refracted Tron: Legacy trim, menacing the twisting ribbons of future-road that are the treacherous way through them. This is pure arcade thrills, Burnout-boosting down a glass and neon highway that flips upside down while you ceiling-ride past hell's own road works equipment through an impossible cyberpunk nightmare city to a pounding electronic soundtrack. Despite being in Early Access there's a healthy game here already, with multiple modes and tracks for days in this unique cyber-horror score-chaser.			",80,17,25,10,11,1,3

								I recomend this game 10/10Backer here (game was kickstarted). This is the spiritual successor to Nitronic Rush. The game is in beta right now and already super fun.Singleplayer and Multiplayer (online and local) are fully working, the level editor is fully integrated and there are already around 150 user created maps on the Steam workshop. The devs are very good at listening to feedback and fixing important bugs with small patches.More info on:http://survivethedistance.com/[1]http://survivethedistance.com/forums/[2]http://www.reddit.com/r/distance ",68,19,1,10,6,1,2

								A technical achievement, with innovative gameplay.  Unfortunately, even if they flesh out the `story mode`, there is little to do in this game other than proceed to the end of each track, each of which seems to be composed of cookie cutter components.  There are no deeper goals, no unlockables, no sense of progress, and no sense of reward.  There's no chaining combos, or learning new moves, or devious AIs, or special challenge levels, just an endless runner that happens to have wheels and loading screens every 3-7 minutes.Am I in love with the controls, the moveset, and the motif? Absolutely.  Can I spend hours browsing the workshop for more levels to add more content? Yes, but custom levels alone cannot expand the experience to the point that this game graduates from tech demo to actual title.  When every level feels like a repeat, and the only game mode is shallow, I can't recommend this as a full priced title.  Sure, the game is in early access, and things could change, but the developers seem pretty clear in their direction, happy with the trajectory and `Overwhelmingly Postivie` feedback so far, so adding depth to the game doesn't seem to be on their radar at all.  If I thought it would change, I would hold off on the negative review and see, but I find the possibility highly unlikely, so I'm going to go ahead and say it's not worth the full price, and it probably won't ever be.In short, the gameplay is amazing, there just isn't a game to go with it.

								This game is Trackmania combined with Need For Speed and TRON and just as good as that combination sounds! It's a unique and really fun racing game with beautiful visuals, tight controls, awesome stunts and level editing, atmospheric music. It's got the works.I'm a beta backer of this game, so I got it for 15 euro. This game right now ( with the -15% 16.99 sale ) is a bargain! If you've ever loved racing games, I don't see any reason to not get this.If you want to play the ""demo"" version of this game, go play it's prequel, Nitronic Rush. It's a little different, but mainly the same game.8.5/10 - Lowered the score simply because it's still early access, so it's lacking some optimization, options and more importantly ( to me ) the old narrator from Nitronic Rush and the music tracks. They have announced that they plan to add the narrator with the original voice actor as an option in the game in the future though, so there's that!			",73,6,4,8,8,1,12

								If Nitronic Rush was Narbacular Drop, then this is Portal... 2.Everything about Nitronic Rush has been given a staggering upgrade. The controls are dialed-in just right, the level layouts have very obviously been playtested extensively. I've played the game for less than two hours  and completed most of the currently standing content. Now this isn't a bad thing, I spent a huge amount of time playing Nitronic Rush, so that counts as experience. The new player will not be able to breeze through what's there anywhere near as quickly. And on top of that, the game is still in beta so there's clearly lots more planned. There are still a few minor things that need polish/explanation, mostly on the UI side of things. But the game underneath is absolutely incredible.Missing out on this game is doing yourself a disservice. Don't make that mistake.			",70,12,3,3,11,2,0

								May not be the racing game you've been looking for to put years of commitment into, but, at the same time, it is. Believe it when it says ""Survival Racing"". I can't wait to see more of this game. Great concept, amazing execution, loads of content thanks to the in game level creator, and plenty of overall content to keep you coming back somewhat consistently at the least. The best game I could compare it to would be San Francisco Rush 2049, Cruisin Exotica/USA, or even Hydro Thunder. It is absolutely amazing, even if you're not into racing games, this is one you could really sink time into.To play the game, all you need to do is play the tutorial and pay attention. To win, you need patience. There is no learning curve to this game; it is a cliff. You just have to throw yourself off the edge over and over again until you learn where the pull chord is, only to drift into lava or get grabbed by a passing airplanes turbine. Even so, it is fun in its own right. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								To start off, I'd like to point out that I do not like most racing games, and I'd also like to point out that Distance is not most racing games. Distance puts you in control of a vehicle that can fly with wings, has jets on all sides, can wall ride, jump, flip, and do anything in between. The controls feel fantastic, the music is amazing, the enviorments are immersive, huge and explorable. There is an adventure mode that acts like the tutorial and tells the story of the game (which is actually quite good, especially when you realize it's being told through a race track), however the real fun begins when you enter the challenge maps of the game. The developers respect player skill and are not afraid to give you a real challenge. Add in community levels and steam workshop, and you'll have replayability and new maps forever. I can't love this game enough, if you feel on the edge about it, I'd highly reccomend trying out Nitronic Rush. It is free and it is the predecessor to Distance. It functions relatively the same as Distance, and will give you a feel for what you can expect from Distance. However, keep in mind that Distance is much more polished, detailed and has a lot of improvements.			",128,19,1,14,9,0,4

								While I never played Nitronic Rush, I did play Rush 2049 back nearly 15 years ago (fairly sure both on the Dreamcast and N64) which I guess heavily inspired Nitronic Rush. Rush 2049 back in the day felt really enjoyable and worth playing a lot of.  Stunt Mode in Distance feels exactly how I remember stunt mode in Rush 2049 feeling (which to be fair it probably feels a lot smoother in this, but its been nearly 15 years). As for the race tracks defualtly in the game they feel challenging, easy to complete, but hard to master. Even though there is not a lot of courses built in yes, because they are challenging courses with a lot of parts to master I can see spending a lot of time enjoying playing the same tracks over just to get that little bit better each time.With that said, it is definitly early access, ""Story""/ ""Adventure"" mode right now is just a handfull of tracks that you complete with no AI drivers to compete against, no ghost to race against, heck it doesn't even tell you your time at the end when you complete a track it just goes straight into the next one.To sum up, its definitly not finished yet, it has about 11 longer tracks, 7ish short challenge tracks, and 7ish stun arenas, but currently 366 user created tracks. The courses are highly repeatable because they have a high challenge and learning curve, while user created tracks will be hit and miss, there is definitly a lot to try from.Would I recommend this game? While the tracks feel a bit empty without an option to race your ghost, I would definitly recommend this game, specially if you liked Rush 2049 or Nitronic Rush. This game is great to play by yourself and even better to play with friends. Obviously its a lot better with friends, but unlike games like Mario Party or Smash Brothers  that pretty much require friends to be enjoyable, it is still really good even if you have no one to play with.Now to download some user generated tracks to see how they feel.

								Normally I don't play racing games. It's not that I don't like them, I just find that there's not enough content. Now, I have no idea what Nitronic Rush had... Perhaps the colorscheme, or the feel of actual speed, or more likely the insane gravity defying mechanics ...but somehow I absolutely loved it. Naturally as the predecessor of that game, I'd expect just as much from Distance, And they delivered. not only is there a stronger sense of speed, they also enhanced the engine, allowing for some crazy gravity-defying roads and unique obstacles that launch you, explode you or just plain cut you in half and let you struggle to the next checkpoint. Now I'm not saying the game is perfect, there are a few tiny things that bug me. First of all, the colors don't seem as extravegant and intense as I remember them in the first game, also it get's anoying randomly exploding because you are riding along the wall to just barely pass by a sawblade. But as a fan of Nitronic Rush, I can't help but love Distance as well. 9.5/10			",196,34,2,18,38,2,27

Now that the students have made their own studio - Refract - they have made a more, polished version of the old game. Playing this game always gives a a rush of adrenaline, and a smile on my face, and with multiplayer, and worshop racetracks, what's not to love?!P.S. - One of the BEST Early Acess Steam games EVER.

It still really fun, I intentionally crash into lasers cause it is probably the best looking aesthetic in any game.Speaking of which, Distance also has an amazing art style and music. Get it now.

								AWESOME GAME.

At this time my review starts to be great but... the game lacks of more campaign levels, there's only one car model, no FPS view(Yeah it would add more difficulty but could be cool.), Sadly(or hopefully) no mobile version(Yeah for peoples who don't have a Portable Computer it would be cool), but apart of those missing things this game is a piece of fun, nothing to add about the funness and the difficulty of it.

 TL;DR I absolutely recommend this game if you like having your own music to listen while driving in a Psudo-Future track racing game. The game has  come quite a long way	, and it deserves all the praise it gets.This game is so much fun, especially with friends, I'll try to form review that's semi coherent, but this game blows my mind so it's a little difficult. Pros: The ability to put my favorite songs from the Outrun/Futuresynth genre, fly around and have great looking visuals is enough for my purchase.I'm happy with the seasonal updates, they add a cute side effect while driving. The game isn't that demanding either, especially for good GPU's like mine, R9 390, you can literally turn everything off, and have a simple looking game.The community builds these amazing levels, that are not only the single most difficult thing I've had to master as a gamer, but they encourage replayability. Think if Audiosurf had more freedom, and a more intense third-person-car-timed-race feel.I look forward to future updates, and will keep playing the game, because it hasn't lost it's replayability yet. Cons: Not many from what I've seen.If they had to improve on one thing, it'd have to be the controller navigation on the ending screen showing all the end scores and rating of the level.Maybe being able to include your steam music library and playlists, as I'd love not to create another folder for every album I download or buy, just to sort through all the music I have, which is over 2700 songs. It'd be nice to have a browser for desktop music, as the navigation to your music is dependent on left and right movements of the dpad or the arrow keys, having to find the right song is a tedious process, having to copy paste in the text from the Windows explorer top text bar, EX: C:\Users\*username*\Desktop\DistanceMusic.

								Distance is a high-octane reaction-based arcade racing game set in what I can only assume to be a computer program with a sick EDM (primarily techno) soundtrack to go with it. A spiritual successor to Nitronic Rush, you have only seconds to react to what's in front of you and sometimes not even that much time is given. While sometimes frustrating with no particular payoff other than beating your times, Distance is an exciting game with a cool setting and a great soundtrack. Gameplay: 8.5/10: Distance offers a variety of game modes including a short campaign, arcade sprint, stunt and style races, versus race, and split-screen up to four players. Each gameplay mode, outside of the multiplayer, is mildly lacking in replay value (unless you're a perfectionist and want to get to the top of the leaderboards which I personally could easily see myself attempting). When you enter the multiplayer it becomes an insane race for first, style points, or who can pull off the most wicked stunt. The last time I felt a game play this smooth and fun was Split/Second and that's what this game reminds me of... only if it were set in Tron.Graphics: 8/10: The setting is stunning and the tracks are intense to race on. Neon colours flash past you as you go from 0-250mph in just a few short seconds and the environment keeps up with the action you experience. However, upon closer inspection the environment isn't the most detailed setting, with speed of levels (no laps) and need for concentration aiding in the distractability from the environment itself. The car itself is physically stunning and fun to look at, particularly when you activate the thrusters or flight ability. When it explodes for the umpteenth time, you might be a little remorse at the fact that it constantly splits into the same fractal polygons and rains over the landscape below, but if you can get over that sort of thing you might just find yourself immersed in the reactive world around you, which brings us to our next point.Sound: 9/10: Arguably the star of the game is the notion that the environment reacts to the pumping techno beats and seems to simulate a synesthetic experience. The developers turn sound into visuals which vastly aid in drawing you in to the overall experience. I even found myself reacting and driving to the beat, which for some reason was always perfectly timed to the rest of the level, even if you were to crash with a digitally explosive sound. The soundtrack is genuinely something I find myself coming back to the game to enjoy over and over and over again. The car sounds beautiful and is perfectly matched to its sporty design. I keep returning to the game just to hear the music again and again. I love it that much!Last WordsDistance is a fun game for perfectionists but if you're into unlocks and specials outside of what you purchase, you'll want to look elsewhere. A visual and audible synesthetic experience that draws you in, Distance is the perfect spiritual successor to some of the most fast-paced and intense racing games on the market.8.5/10 - Give it a go, especially if you catch it on sale!

There is always a way: drive on the wall or ceiling, fly openly, jump across roads, zig-zag between traps. You name it! The graphic style combined with the subtle music, set the futuristic mood prefectly. I sense there will be a lot of hours I will spend on the game.PS: Could there be a separation between the resolutions based on the aspect ratio?

								Distance is what happens when a car is given Neo's powers from the matrix.The difference between the Matrix and Distance is that instead of watching something great, you're playing something great.+Excellent phyisics+Music that fantasticly captures the setting and style of the game+CARKOR (car parkor)+over 24 maps built in and BILLIONS more from the workshop+LEVEL CREATORWell worth the price and time. Distance is one of those games that will make you wonder why you didn't have it sooner.Update: IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS AND THERE ARE JUST AS MANY SINGLE PLAYER MISSIONS NOW AS THERE WERE WHEN THE GAME FIRST LAUNCHED.But hey look at these player created maps we picked this week.

								This game reminds me a lot of Tron Legacy and Wipeout HD, amazing sountracks but some bugs in this game are a turnoff.Pros:The graphics are neatSountracksLevel editorCons:Online multiplayer, at the beginning of each race, there is someone who flashes like a discoball and i cannot see where i driveCustom levels, some players are making their own circuit with hidden portals that can teleport them to the end of the track, they finish the races in 30 seconds while it takes 8 minutes for me.Really complicated controls with a xbox controller, i wouldn't like to know how it is with a keyboard.This game is too much hardware demanding, it needs to get optimised, playing at ultra on some workshop maps the game is running with 12fps or so.Overral, it's a really nice game, even if it's in beta. I would recommend it only to those who own a xbox 360 controller :D			",166,11,2,19,13,1,22

								This game does everything right. I usually don't play racing games (I have none on my steam account), but I decided to pick this one up. The atmosphere, the colour, the mystery, and the overall mind-bending aspects of this game make it my favourite game that I've gotten so far. At first glance, it will just seem like a colourful driving game, but seriously, I have found EVERYTHING that I've wanted in a racing game here, it's fast paced, challenging (but not too difficult once you get into it), and certain aspects like spinning around to jump on upside-down surfaces, or suddenly having the gravity turn off and learning to adjust your playstyle make it super addictiveThis game is also packed with lore, but it's never explicitly shoved in your face. The story mode seems to be about some kind of society that released... something, but that's all I've been able to figure out so far. I don't want to spoil anything either, but every detail of the adventure mode is packed with information about what happened. The adventure mode makes me feel like I'm delving into the past, trying to uncover what happened to this society. I've actually played the adventure mode three times now just because of how awesome it feels, it's so fun, and there are a lot of parts that feel so ominous, like I'm watching the end of the world but I don't entirely understand how it happened. The starting cut scene, that just shows the car starting, gives tons of information on the story, but you won't realize it unless you play it through again, and even the loading screens give you a glimpse into what is going onOverall I am thoroughly impressed with this game. Every aspect of it comes together to make a masterpiece. One thing I'd recommend is making sure you have the right hardware to be able to run it, because the game is just so freaking awesome and having any sort of lag would take away from the experience (you can change the visual settings and that does help, but again the game looks so amazing on full quality)10/10, I can't wait to see this game when it's completely finished, despite how polished it is already			",126,16,1,13,13,2,13

								This is such a great game, that there are a lot of words to describe it. It has very good levels both in the workshop and built in, the challenge part gives challenging levels to those that find the levels too easy. All in all I really recommend this game, only problem I see is the 6 player online limit at least for the most part, I feel to combat this it should be up to 10-15 since there are some people that with the current would need 2 servers for everyone to play. However, since this is early access I look forward to seeing how the game changes hopefully it stays at the same level or goes to greater lengths.			",129,55,11,28,12,1,5

								If you like tron, eye candy, fast paced arcade racing, a good car to look at, dropping acid and a chill mixtape, this IS the game for you. It's a beautiful enveloping experience with the music and racetracks they've put together. Escape into your monitor or span it along 3 monitors or ♥♥♥♥ even a large flatscreen, it's one hell of a ride. For me, each level/map/sector has its own unique feel and difficulty.If you play with a controller, it'll be a breeze, however if you're a keyboard user it'll take some getting use to. The controls aren't an instant WTF DO I DO. The game slowly introduces you to new tricks and tips for controlling your sexy little car. The physics glitch out at times for me, when I'm performing wall jumps my car will instantly flip around when I launch off the surface and it'll slide toward the gravitational pull of the map. If you're on a map with a portal and you go backward thru it, you'll get stuck in an infinite loop or sometimes spawn below the map (but you can blow yourself up and try again). The flying mechanics could use a bit of work as well. At times when I deploy the wings off a jump, the car will start rotating and gaining control of it can be tough if you’re on a keyboard. There is a lack of content for this game, but hell, the maps they've got are great and you can finish them in multiple ways with different paths. I've spent some time doing the time trial races and it's really addictive.The multiplayer functionality is good, however I haven't played it much but it is pretty fun (I'll update it as I play more online). There's usually a few (4-6) servers that have games loaded with their own maps. When racing online, there is a time limit, so if you're spectating a new dude you won't be sitting there for hours waiting for him/her to finish. All in all, I pretty sure I missed a few key aspects but nonetheless, it's a very fun game. The graphics are spectacular, the soundtrack is immersive it's a unique experience that I've lost myself in. I really hope the developers make more content for this game, it'd be a shame if they didn't because this software has potential.			",43,2,2,0,0,0,1

								Distance is a racing-game/platformer where you need to jump, evade, fly and rotate to survive:+ perfect driving handling+ all about shaving off seconds+ 4 player local split-screen+ online modes+ random track generation+ powerful level editor+ strong community extending life greatly+ atmospheric+ crazy good music+ music-synced visuals+ attempts story+ VR+ very polished- mediocre flying aspect- breaking/not-boosting is never the best tactic- no real curves due to skips- no collision online- no AIOverall it is an awesome and innovative game and if you accept the fact that it is not a classical racing game then you will love it.

								Though there's not much to the game at it's current state, this game is a really fun experimental survival racing experience. If you've never played nitronic rush before, I would highly recommend giving it a try because it shares a very simmilar playing style. this game features racing at 999999999 Km/h, Being cut into five peices and still being able to get to the next checkpoint, various gravity shifts, flying a car, super mega turbo jets of doom and last but not least, customizable car... colours. (I really hope they add in a actual custom cars thing though.) This game was a great experience for me. There's also a great active community supplying levels left and right. Is it worth 22 bucks? some people will say yes and some people will say -Eesh-. Like I said, there's not much to the game as of this review, it is still in a very early state of developpement but has the potential to grow.... SO much. UPDATE:After playing more, I've realized that there is some severe problems in terms of taxing a GPU. for example, on some levels I get sub 50 fps though I clearly should run that slow considering I have an overclocked Radeon 7970 that can run almost anything at 60 fps no problem. this game shouldn't be an exeption especially with it not that stunning graphics. IN SHORT: people with low-end graphics solutions should wait this out until there is some better graphics optimisations.			",40,3,5,3,4,0,0

								I give it ... Five Stars!If you're thinkin about getting it, get it! This is actually my first time posting a review of any kind, and that should say something.  I saw this game on the store page, bought it, and it was worth every penny.  This game is perfect for someone who is looking for a racing game but wants to step away from the traditional stick-shifter, and move in the direction of a sci-fi obstacle course where your pilot a highly advanced supercar equipped for land, air, and zero gravity travel!  It made me think of Sonic All-Stars and maybe the baby of Kario Kart and Portal or something.  I've never seen anything like it, very original gameplay and you can even make your own levels.  I just recently purchased the game and I've spent seven hours on it.  Refract did an amazing job and I wish them the best of luck! If I could make a request for the next update; pick up items for versus style gameplay, and a shuffle option for maps! That would be pretty radical.One last thing, the introduction video was very exciting and I actually saw a huge potential for storyline development.  I'm eager to see where it goes, I know you guys won't disappoint!P.s., It was awesome.Edit: I noticed the design for the car would actually be usable design for an all terrain sports car.  Just thought I would add that and cross my fingers that someone might comment regarding the car's design.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								So happy to have found this beautiful game. It has a level editor and a tutorial, and although it definitely takes some getting used to, will surely be taking a bunch of my time. The community levels already begin to show what can be done, the tracks are very adjustable, things like jumps from one track to another where one track is at 90 degrees (wall) or 180 degrees (cieling) relative to the other. Lots of decorations available too in the editor. Amazing value for the price, no bugs as far as I've seen, and works fine in three-screen surround. The nVidia 3D surround still seems to need some work, but already looks very cool.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Many games nowadays incorporate some ""drive-fast-and-you-don't-fall-off-the-ceiling"" mechanic, such as Grip or Distance.Although this mechanic originated around the time of the N64 and the original Playstation, Distance brought it back. This game will send you swirling though various tracks that loop, swoop, spin, and invert. You can stick to the track however it bends, but this won't achieve any record-setting lap times. To be the best, you must leave the track. You can jump onto walls and other obstacles around the world to find the quickest way to the finish line; you can even jump straight to the ceiling if it's not too high above you.That said, many workshop levels are simple roller coasters, requiring you to hold the boost without letting go. How boring, right? The best challenges this game can throw at you will have you jumping from rooftop to interstate overpass to rooftop, and will force you to dodge laser beams and sawblades the whole way. It's a bit like Meat Boy, if you're into that!			",56,5,5,3,9,0,1

Just download a bunch of levels from workshop and cycle through them all.

								So It took me a couple days just because once you hit the nightmare stuff it gets moderately frustrating. Best advice is keep calm and pay attention. As difficult as this gets in Distance its key. Theres a way I feel that a Hotas Dualstick controller system would do a lot better with this game than a Keyboard or Xbox 360 controller would. Thats the negatives so far.Positives are quite a few; Take Tron, a light touch of the Horror genre, and the Matrix Highways and the portals from Dystopia and you have Distance. The in game suspense gets quite affective at times. I put down the campaign a few times just to get my head clear from the in game 'stressors' but once I figured out what I was doing its quite fun. I enjoy racing games and this made my engine purr. Refract, I salute the skill put into this so far. Glad to be supporting you know, hopeful for your bright future. 10/10			",176,18,0,15,6,2,21

								I love this game, I really do, and have been waiting for this title to progress in development since I first heard it coming out. Everything about this game is amazing, its smooth, its fun, its arcady, and its insanely fun to play with your friends.That being said, the only thing I have against this game at its current stage in development is the online.There aren't many servers up, every time I've gone on to look for servers, there have only been 2. I'm sure this will change, but in the meantime, I'll be eagerly waiting, playing Insurgency.			",155,17,3,14,6,0,11

								So.. what is Distance?It is the result of combining techno-style lighting and (damn nice!) soundtrack with action-filled and absolutely epic gameplay, all packed into GORGEOUS graphics and futuristic atmosphere.You see that curvy road twisting around itself? A bit behind the others, are we? Well, how about we friggin FLY ABOVE AND BELOW THE DAMN TRACK TO GIVE OURSELVES SOME ADVANTAGE?!Oh, and while we're doing that, let's do a barrel roll!And honestly, if it wouldn't say so, I'd never have guessed this is Early Access!Pros! Brilliant Soundtrack Gorgeous Graphics Action-packed and fun gameplay Barrel Rolls! Jumping cars with wings and lights and... stuff Darude - SandstormCons The Level Editor is... complex. Very powerful indeed, but you have to get used to it. No actual Darude - Sandstorm.This game is fan-♥♥♥♥in-tastic!			",30,0,0,9,4,0,1

								Couldn't care less about Tron as I never experienced the golden side of it (Not to take away from those who do love it though), so that side does not contribute to my love of this game.Anyway, onto the review. I've only played for a short time but I can see this becoming one of my favourite racing games. The flight adds such strategy to overtaking, making you have to watch the road for obstacles, and the sky for rivals.You have to time jump, direct flight, dodge lasers, jump from road to road. Plus a great boost system of cool down by passing through gates instead of having to earn it on the go.Can't wait to play a local game with friends and watch the ensuing chaos			",387,112,12,27,71,6,25

								Up until recently one of the most original racing games I've ever played. If you like games like f-zero, track mania and Wipeout then you will probably also like this one.Distance primarly focuses on survival through stunting up, over and under things as you make your way through countless of haphazard areas full of razors and spiked steamrollers. At a certain moment the track starts to rotate horizontally and you even get to drive upside down, straight up and every other angle you can imagine. After a certain while you don't even really know what up and down is anymore, was it not for the arrow on the back of your car that indicates which way down actually is. I do however find myself never really looking at the thing as most community made tracks are so fast and require your full attention. After a while you will be constantly propelling yourself forward with the turbo, jump and angle your car 45 degrees with the thrusters and as soon as you land things might start popping up left and right trying to slice your car in half. You jump on the straight orientated road again and go through a portal which then suddenly leaves you hanging in mid air. The upbeat music has stopped and been replaced for the muffled sounds of you trying to maneuver your car in zero-g. There is also a story, which is something about you being inside of a computer-thingy which is infected by a virus. Which will become apparent in the storyline mode, but not so much right now. This game mainly thrives from the steam workshop integration as there are a lot of custom maps which can leave you playing this game for a long time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I would definitely recommend Distance to anyone who's looking for something different.First, some history: Distance was funded on Kickstarter in 2012. The team consists of many if the developers who worked on the game Nitronic Rush. Enough history.Distance doesn't truly fall into any one category, with its multitude of game modes, and openness to really just do whatever you want in any mode. With the level editor, you can create the race track of your dreams or make a playground for some high-octane parkour.And no matter what you decide to do in Distance, you'll be doing it to a bad-♥♥♥ soundtrack.Here's some videos from my channel:

								Ok, so I spent like 10$ on this game, and believe me, last game I've bought for more than 5$ was probably gta4 around 3 years ago. Why did I do that? Simply because I've fallen in love with its prequel, nitronic rush. You can check it out, i think it's 100% free to download.Imo, compared to NR, Distance still lacks these perfectly designed, not-so-trivial campaign levels. In return we get unlimited amount of tracks from the community, and some of them are really beautiful, some quite surprising, some surprisingly creative.Multiplayer works and it's pretty fun, haven't checked splitscreen yet (but it is there).Also, I can't really imagine playing this game without gamepad. My friend played on keyboard and, while he still had really good time with the game, he couldn't micro his movement while freefalling (or in 0G) that well.So, my recomendation: Download NR, try it for yourself if you like it, and then throw some money at these guys, because I think they really deserve it.

								I bought this game very early and was acutally quiet happy with it. The graphics were astonishing.there were a few intense and awesome maps and a creative Community so we could use  the workshop. I saw the latest update and started to play it again and saw all those changes. To ability to put in your own music, the boombox mode which turns your car and the world around you in a music synchronicing beatvisualizer, the option to customize the car a little bit , the little detail like the star screen on your car when you are staying at the same spot for a short time... i love all of these ! I realy love such details and i am very very happy that you can see that this game is still evolving, i swear, this is gonna be one hell of a game when it is finished.But the best thing about this new update is the Trackmogrify mode. You just type in some random words, number , sentences , whatever you want...and the game creates a racetrack. Type in stuff like ""rainbow road"" and fell free to have a nice journey on a colourful , rainbowcolored track... type in ""lightning storm"" to get yourself into an intense storm full of lightningstrikes. This mode got rid of a big problem Distance had. After a while you had yourself through all levels and there wasnt much to do. This new mode gives you an incredible, endless amount of new tracks you can generate in less than a few seconds and can be quiet funny. Now Distance isnt just a good game anymore. It turned into a very good game, full of potential. If the designers behind this gem are still updating it in the future and bring even more content out this game will be on my top games of all time, it has so much potential and i can see that the creators have some neat ideas and i am excited for the future.Graphic: 10/10 , very beatiful and uniqueGameplay : 8.5/10 , unique and awesome gameplay, but i feel like there is potential for more and different modes, the new Trackmogrify mode is a good start!Sound: 10/10 , nice futuristic sounds, clear and good quality Music: 9/10 , very fitting, has a electronic style and sums up the level you are playing but not much variety of soundtracks BUT you can bring your own music into the game now which is absolutly awesome. The game even responds to your music in very different ways , like visualizers.Variety: 8/10 , thanks to the new gamemode , the workshop and some implemented level you have a nice variety of different tracks, but i have the feeling the game could use some more ""Items"" to put into the world. New traps or stuff like that ;)Story: 4/10 , the game has a short adventure mode but its more like a longer tutorial. There are some interesting scenes , levels and more in it but there isnt realy a good or long story, but this game doesnt realy need one, because it isnt a game which is designed for an overwhelming story but for the pure amount of fun you can have whilst playing it.

								This is one of the best racing games out there! If you're new the the game or you're a Nitronic Rush veteran (Like me), you'll find this game enjoyable with a confortable difficulty curve. It carries a lot of mechanics from NR and improving them at the same time, plus it adds a few things to the NR formula that I'll let you discover. Accompanied by a great soudtrack from the guys for the previous game,. you'll have a great experience with this game!The game has a lot of eye candy, which can be a bad thing for some levels, reaching 45 FPS on the worst of days, for a game that should be smooth, it does breaks the experience a bit. But if your computer's up the the task, go ahead :D....Oh... and there's a level editor and multiplayer inside... if you're into that kind of stuff :3.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Full disclosure: I backed this game on kickstarter.Distance is basically what you'd get if you put Tron, a racing game, and a rave into a blender that made games.You can drive on the walls, ceilings, and basically anything else. Your car can fly!The controls feel really tight, and even when your car is damaged the physics kind of make it less annoying - having your car sliced in half and driving half a car to the next checkpoint is fairly entertaining.The game is, however, a bit short at the moment. Once you know what you're doing the story mode doesn't take very long, and neither do the other modes. There are generated levels and workshop levels, though, and there's supposed to be a story mode update at some point.Pros:- Cool car mechanics- Lots of modes- Everything glows. You can turn up the glowing if there's not enough glowing.- Replayability, level editor, random level generator- Still updating long after the kickstarter!Cons:- Really short story mode / modes in general			",193,56,11,16,14,0,23

								This game may be the absolute best racing game I have ever played. It's insanely intense and super hype. The music is most likely the best soundtrack I've personally heard from a game. It's surprisingly hard to get the hang of the controls and learn how to manuever your car around countless tracks full of insanity. The only suggestions i have for this game are to release a complete soundtrack after the release and to make it easier to access the steam workshop levels because when I first subscribed to a few of the community levels, it took me a minute to find them.

								This game does a lot of things right. If you like ""arcade"" style driving games that are very responsive (albeit not very realistic) like the Burnout series over say, something like Forza, you'll like this game. It's fast, it's responsive, you don't spend your entire time against the walls and it's generally pretty fun.Graphics are pretty smoothe and visually appealilng, although a bit too ""dark"" for my tastes.Overall, it's a solid driving game and the flying/jumping adds a really fun aspect to the game. But where this game loses the appeal for me is: it just doesn't make me want to play it. There aren't a lot in the way of goals, or trying to master the levels, or things like that. The levels are also uninspiring from each other, they're all pretty much the same thing.It's one of the best driving games I've ever not wanted to play... if that makes any sense.I'm still going to recommend it because they did one thing right that a lot of games don't, and that's the actual racing. It's solid. Maybe make up your own goals and you'll be fine.			",48,9,7,5,15,0,4

VR REVIEWI highly recommend this to anyone with a VR headset. I used an xbox controller as a gamepad, and played in the first person mode. As a small disclaimer, I do not find myself motion sick very easily, but I did not feel any motion sickness at all until I turned on a few settings. There are a few settings in this game that could cause sickness with artificial movement, however these can be turned off. There are a lot of competitive modes, and I do not feel at any disadvantage to others when playing, however, there is a 3rd person mode as well, and different scaling settings if you feel uncomfortable.PROS  Gameplay works very well in VR.  Great visuals and music.  The game isnt a normal racer, and does take a good amount of skills in order to complete many tracks (watch a few videos and you will understand.)  1st and 3rd person options, and both have scaleable units.  Options that may cause motion sickness can be disabled.  Information is displayed nice and clear in the car itself, although this becomes a little less readable in 3rd person.  Many small details that make the experience very enjoyable.CONS  A very small possible disadvantage due to wearing the headset.  Difficult to text chat while wearing the headset, no real support for typing in VR. This is more so a hardware limitation than a software limitation, and there are work arrounds. Text box is easily read while ingame, however.  Sudden crashes may throw people off since the camera stops instantly and you watch parts go flying. ",87,11,0,10,28,3,7

								Great game for what they have so far! Looking forward to future updates.I only have a poopy/old laptop to play on but even with on the lowest possible settings for graphics I still get probably 20-40 frames. This is kinda a silly request, seeing as how I’m sure that the game runs fine on more current computers, but it would be awesome to have even more settings to be able to turn off to increase frame rates. Besides frame rate, the only other concern I had is some issues with input lag but as far as I know, those are tied to the frame rate. ",138,57,0,11,6,2,9

								Really fun, good artstyle (reminds me of TRON), good music. Has a sort of ""WipEout"" vibe to it. It'll be interesting to see where this game goes when more is added to it, but as early access/beta/whatever games go, this is a solid one.Only slight annoyances are the flying controls and the WASD booster things, they just feel a bit wonky (you have to operate and think about too many things at once, also the camera points itself in unhelpful directions while this is happening) and interrupt the smooth speed of the ground segments.The Steam workshop functionality is well-integrated, meaning it's easy to play new community-created maps all the time, and even create your own. There's also online multiplayer which is pretty fun.EDIT: It seems as though the most popular online maps are ""parkour"" ones which involve awkward mid-air maneuvering and tricky jumps, as opposed to speedy racing. I can't say I like these parkour tracks very much - they usually involve repeatedly failing a certain segment before moving on to the next one and repeating that process until the end, but even so, the online is still fun, and the community maps can be quite creative.Overall if you like racing games, futuristic stuff and DnB, this is probably a game for you.

However, if you have some friends who are willing to take on the learning curve of this game, this game can be pretty great, especially with the Workshop support.Also, the fact that they added VR is fantastic. Playing it makes me want to vomit from motion sickness, but it's still pretty cool.			",286,32,3,26,31,2,13

								Brings back nostalgic memories of ""San Francisco Rush: Extreme Racing"" for me. Bought this game in the initial Early Access and playing it now I can definitely see refinements and improvements from the initial release. A very fun, fast paced, arcade style racer--peppered with ariel flight, crazy obstacles, and quick-reaction based scenarios. Lots of fun on the split-screen, online, or solo. Community tracks are very cool, and there is a vast amount to choose from!8.5/10			",459,120,29,29,39,4,25

								Absolutely fantastic game- good level editor, excellent, simple gameplay. Do you want to go fast? Do you want to do Parkour while in a flight capable digital car that goes about a thousand miles an hour while Daft Punk is blasting in the background? Have you ever played F-zero and thought: I wish this was taking place in Tron? That's more or less what this game is. It is very, very good.			",174,23,2,43,7,3,28

Early Access Review
								This game has been on my list for a while, and I finally bought it. Maybe you're like me and you just wanted a nifty racing game with bots. Unfortunately, there aren't any bots, and I haven't minded one bit, nor have I touched the multiplayer. The tracks are all beautiful. I've downloaded 75 workshop tracks and all but three of them were fun, some were absolute gems. The controls are doable, I use a gamepad with a custom sort of setup that works for me, you'll find one that works for you.It's almost a puzzle racer, because you have to figure out how to solve the particular sections of particular tracks. And when you do, doing it at super high speed is very fun. That's why you don't need bots; the survival/puzzle racing aspect of the game makes it engrossing enough to where you forget you're alone on the track. That coupled with the awesome soundtrack and the amazeballs neon/whatever tracks makes this a really addictive, fun game. So if you're like me and you're on the fence because of the lack of bots, go for it. Price-wise, I bought it on sale. I'll almost certainly get 20 hours out it though what with how many community maps there are, but I'll certainly get 10 satisfying my 1$=1hr rule. So on sale I heavily recommend it and at full price I still say give it a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
