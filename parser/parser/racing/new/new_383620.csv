												This game is very... meh. I have FSX, and that is highly recommended by me, but this is not. It is a terrible port from mobile, and the missions don't really make a lot of sense. Even though this game is less than $5, don't buy it, unless you have a seven year old. then you should consider buying it on your iPhone.			",0,0,1,0,2,0,0

												UPDATED REVIEW.With joysticks now supported I can give this a thumbs up.Its a fun little flight game. Not really a simulator. Plane Physics are no the best bur doing the missions are fun. The ground textures could use some work though. Id rather have a basic flat texture than pixelated satillite views.ORIGINAL REVIEWWhy no joystick Support?!?!   I really wanted to like this simplistic Flight Simulator. I play super sims like DCS FSX and ROF  this game would have been awesome to play on my laptop but i cant use my joystick!  I know its a mobile port but come on!  I wish i liked playing sims on mobile but i really dont.. its no fun without a joystick.. PLEASE fix this! This would be a great little sim.
