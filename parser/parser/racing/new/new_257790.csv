												Riptide GP 2 is an excellent jet ski racing game set in a future utopia so rich that mankind can afford to setup above ground water canals that go up hill. Its a fun, enjoyable, easy to play, tough to master sort of game with unlockables, upgrades and different watercraft to buy. There's a lot of content here and a healthy several hour campaign for a game where its longest races are a mere three minutes long.Kudos to the developers for making a game where water crafting is a serious sport with helmets rather than the bikini clad fun fest it could have been. Even going for the watercraft genre shows a lot of talent. There are admirable animations of tricks and riders, the water physics feel good, because you'll never have the exact same experience no matter how many times you play on the game's thirteen circuits.From the start of the game, you get four modes: the career, VR time trials, online multiplayer which is dead and split screen multiplayer for when you have real friends over. You are offered an optional tutorial, but the game is simple enough to understand. Use a keyboard or a 360 controller, sway your body, use your accelerator, turbo boost and perform tricks in the air to replenish your turbo meter.The turbo boost feels quick and speedy, but its a ramping acceleration rather than a giant boost. So your best bet is to wait until that meter is full before using it. Once you use it, the turbo keeps going until you're out.Under normal circumstances its best to use turbo in a straight away, but with Riptide GP's trick system, its best to use turbo going into low jump. Why low jumps? Because they're too low to perform tricks, but if you use your turbo, then you have just enough of a window to get a trick in. If you fail a trick, you wipe out, your body rag dolls on the water and sometimes your watercraft smacks into you. There's an easy respawn button, but it costs you time. Even if you fail the landing, you still get your turbo charged.Tricks are easy to pull off on any jump from a ramp or a big wave. When you're in the air pressing both analog sticks right, both analog sticks up, one analog stick left and the other right. While it does replenish your turbo meter, you need to diversify your tricks. Each time you use the same trick twice, you'll get less turbo from it. Grander tricks need more air time for you to finish, but give you far more boost for your effort.Riptide GP 2 is a game about leveling up as you earn money and experience for each event you compete in whether you win or lose. Leveling up grants you a skill point or two that you can use to unlock a new trick or ability. The abilities seem meager, things like gaining a bit more turbo from each trick and being able to perform tricks faster by a fraction of a second.With the cash you earn, you purchase upgrades for acceleration, top speed, handling and boost. You can also purchase better watercraft and that becomes a must, because other racers will have better vehicles and you'll be left in the dust or in this case, the spray. Another nice touch about the game is choosing your exact colors and being able to randomize those colors. While you are yourself in the game, having different colors makes it feel fresh every time you get bored of looking at the same color.There are a diverse array of event types that can change your strategy going in. There are typical races, eliminations, and hot lap challenges, but also free styles where you score points for tricks. Finishing in the top three will grant you one or more stars. Race events are unlocked by your total number of stars so you'll be replaying plenty of quick events.The career spans nine championships and dozens of events while the VR time trials are solo races. The time trials make good use of ghosts and keeping track of your friend's times. So there's always a reason to come back and shave a few seconds off your time while competing against a ghost.During the career, there seems to be two new courses introduced per championship, but the time trials has everything unlocked from the start. The tracks have a few different themes to tell them apart, but several courses look similar with different times of day and a variety of layouts. The two real themes seem to be rich racetrack and arctic racetrack. Some circuits are small and rely on a hairpin circle or a figure eight. If you ever find yourself going in reverse, the game reminds you of the respawn button.While the water physics are good at making ramps, the other game physics feel a kin to the arcade. Its impossible to leap over one section of track into another. There's no way to crash your watercraft, it just realigns you, but never seems to slow you down. The only way you can fall off is failing a trick. These little details keep you playing the game.After going through so many other racing games this feels like it stands out for a lot of reasons. Its fun, its on water and the trick system makes it far more engaging that other methods of gaining turbo. Riptide GP 2 manages to fit a lot of content into a small mobile file size. Its perhaps the largest, best looking game for around 250 MB of file size.			",1120,324,51,104,96,15,167

												I have a hard time recommending this game in its current state. First the things I like.  The games controls great using an xbox 360 controller.The game looks really good.  They didn't just port the mobile version, they upgraded the graphics and it shows.I have not been able to connect to a multiplayer game yet to make any comments about that.  The game just sits there saying waiting for other playersWhat I don't like. and hope they are able to fixFirst the sound.  I am a huge fan of hydro thunder.  And part of what makes that game so awesome is the whole background music and co-pilot talking to you type thing going on.  Sadly there is none of that in this game.  I actually really dislike the background music, it fails at making you feel like your on the edge of your seat like it does in hydro.  The sound effect used for wrecking your jet ski is just plain bad,  reminds me of broken glass.  seriously I just trashed a jet ski and the best sound they could come up with is the sound of dropped glass?I could learn to live with the whole music thing, after all I can turn it off and play my own tunes, which I would recommend doing.  However after 37 races I am losing interest in this game very quick.  I have gone from this is really cool to this is really annoying.  We all know this game is a port of the mobile version.  The mobile version had in app purchases.  Now to their credit they did remove that part of it.  For the record I hate playing games that are pay to win or we are gonna make you grind grind grind.  Well that's what it feels like to me, a giant grind.  Yes this game is nothing more than a grind when you get right down to it.  I am on the third series of races out of 9 all together.  Within each series you have multiple races.  Each series requires x amount of stars to open and each race within requires x amount to open.   I  started to notice after the first series that I just could not compete anymore.  I spend what little money I have on upgrades and bam all of the sudden I am coming in 2 and 3rd.  I have reached yet another point in the 3rd series where I simply can not compete cause my bike is not good enough.  So what do I have to do, gp back to the first series of races that I can actually come in first place now and start racing them over and over again until I earn enough money to be able to compete once again.  An average race only lasts a couple mins so it doesn't seem bad really.  But let me give you an example.  I need 60,000 to unlock all 4 upgrades to my bike.  I would buy a new bike but to get a comparable one in stats it would cost me 100,000.  If you win a race you can make approx 1100 to 2200 if i recall a race.  if come in second or even third you get paid squat.  You do gain extra founds every time you level up as well.  for example if you reach level 8 you get a 8,000 bonus.  a thousand per level if I remember right.  My problem with this all is the fact I have reached a dead end in the game.  I can't win any more races to collect stars to be able to continue in the game.  The only way I can accomplish that is to upgrade my bike so I don't keep getting smoked by an average of 4-6 seconds.  And the only way to upgrade my bike or buy a new one is to grind out races I have already won over and over again.Keep in mind I am only in the 3rd series, this may or may not get better.  I don't know and a may never find out because I am already burned out racing the same couple races over and over trying to earn money so I can upgrade my bike.I can't begin to tell you how many hundreds of hours I have sunk into to hydro thunder, from the original arcade to the dreamcast, even this company's redux of it.  This game was a no brainer for me to purchase.  Kind of regretting it right now.  This is not the next hydro.  However with a few tweaks this game could be awesome in its own right.

												This is a very fun arcade racing game, though only if you're interested in the single player or have friends who also play it, as the multiplayer community seems practically dead. I had a great time completing the single player campaign.  There is a real sense of speed here, and while the graphics are nothing to write home about, they are pleasant enough and run great on my Radeon HD4850.  It took me many tries to score 3 Stars in quite a few of the events, and some I had to come back to later after a few level ups and with a further upgraded hydrojet. The AI is decent, and I didn't notice any rubberbanding.  Crashing into other players or even the scenery only slows you down a little (or a lot if you actuall hit the scenery head-on), and the only way to wipe-out is to land back in the water in the middle of performing a ""Trick"".  In that case, you lose precious seconds while your hydro jet resets back on the track, and then has to accelerate back up to speed.The game worked perfectly with my 360 controller, but didn't recognize a Logitech Attack joystick, so perhaps only the 360 pad is supported.  There is keyboard support , but I didn't use it so can't comment much about how well it works.  It's worth noting that ""auto-acceleration"" can only be disabled when using the controller and is forced for the keyboard.  Mouse is only supported in the menus. The single player Campaign mode is made up of 9 ""Series"" of events .  The events in a series are played stand-alone - there is no ""comlete these X events one after another and then total up your score to get your placement"" type of tours in this game. The first ""Beginner's Luck"" Series contains only 4 events, but this increases all the way up to 12 events in final ""All Stars Cup"".  In each event you get 1, 2 or 3 Stars for placing in the third, second or first place respectively, and the total number of stars are used to unlock/qualify for latter events.  There are four types of events.  ""Race"" is self-explanatory.  In ""Elimination,"" every 15 seconds the racer in the last place is eliminated until only the winner is left.  ""Hot Lap"" has you race a single lap against time, and ""Free Style"" give you 60 seconds to score as many points as you can by performing Tricks.  The first 8 series all contain a mix of these four event types, while the final ""All Stars Cup"" only has Races.A core part of the game game is the character progression system.  As you place in the events, you earn experience points to level up your character, and money to purchase and upgrade hydrojets.  Every time you level up, you get 1-2 skill points to spend on either new Tricks or perks.  There are 9 hydro jets to purchase in addition to the one you start with, all with upgradable Acceleration, Top Speed, Handling and Boost attributes.  Each hydro jet has a different starting and maximum upgradable value for each attribute, and not even the most expensive hydro jet is the best at everything.  I personally prefer the  Lancer which is a Jack-of-all-trades - pretty good in every area but not the best in any.Tricks are crucial to doing performing well in all event types as they are used fill up your boost gauge, as well as scoring points during Free Style events.  Complex tricks giving greater boost and point rewards require more skill points to unlock, and the most difficult ones even have ""prerequisite"" tricks that your character must have first.  As mentioned before, Tricks can only be executed while the hydrojet is in the air, and landing back on the water before the trick is completed results in a temporary wipeout.  The more difficult the trick, the more airtime is required to execute it. Using the same trick multiple times in a single event results in diminishing returns, so it is recommended to have multiple tricks of each difficulty in your repertouire.Dissapointingly, Perks only come in two flavors - extending the boost time granted per trick, and allowing you to land a tiny bit earlier without wiping out while performing a trick (though you get less boost/point rewards if the trick isn't completely finished.)And unfortunately the progression system is a detriment to the Online mode.  Even if you do happen to find someone playing, the chances of them being a similar level as you are very slim, which leads to very one-sided races.  There is an ""Invite Friends"" option though which would work much better if you have Steam friends who you know are a good matchup for you.  I played a few online matches against a couple mis-matched opponents, and didn't notice any lag - the game ran the same as offline.There's a Split Screen option for 2-4 local players, but I couldn't try it because it seems to require each player to use a 360 controller and I only have the one.  I'll update the review if it turns out there's a way around this.The final mode is the ""VR Challenge"" which has you race against the ""ghosts"" of your Steam friends to try to beat their times.  Again, you need to have Steam friends who play this game and have a similarly built up character to yours.TL;DR get this game for the great single player arcade racing, unless you know you have some buddies to play with.

												Great game, very addictive and easily worth £4 or whatever currency you use.I bought this game for myself and 3 other friends over a week ago and we haven't stopped playing since.The graphics are fairly decent for a low price racer and there's a few nice touches with things going on in the background.The steering of the vehiches is very good and responsive. The choice of vehicles isn't a lot but theres still enough choice for different types of races.The career mode is challenging enough with race, elimination, hotlap and freestyle events.The online play is not busy at the moment but at least there is online play and also ""friend invite"" online play which works well.My favourite mode is the VR challenge, which is basically racing 2 or 3 laps of a selected track in the quickest time possible. Your best time is recorded as a ghost so you can race against yourself. But what makes it even better is that your steam friends best times are compared to your own so you can see their character on screen racing and your own which gives you incentive to beat yours and your friends best times, taking corners tighter, boosting at the right time etc. Also you can see the best times on steam on the global leaderboards so you can see yourself climbing the leaderboard each time you improve your race time. So what you waiting for? Go out and buy it and see for yourself. 9/10 rating overall. For the price? 10/10			",221,26,41,3,10,1,11

												If you enjoyed Waverace 64, you will love RIPTIDE GP2!The controls are super smooth and the career mode is  awesome with new hydro jets to unlock, sick stunts to master, and a variety of events to compete in. It feels like you are racing in a futuristic water park The courses are really well designed. Executing tricks will charge your turbo boost meter different amounts depending on the difficulty. Using turbo boost will rocket your jet into high speed thrill mode where you will need to have adept timing to take turns and hit jumps with precision. One of the keys is knowing which trick to pull at the right time.  The better your stunts, the faster you'll go. The waves are active and knowing when to slash through or glide on top of them is another of the many facets of timing and skill mechanics that make RP2 so enjoyable.The ghost feature allows you to race friends and yourself to improve times and climb the leaderboards. Plus, you can race up to 5 players in online multi-player. Throw in a lengthy career mode and kick azz music and you have one of the best racing games around that's easily worth the price tag.Thank you for bringing RIPTIDE GP2 to Steam as I don't own a ""mobile device.""

												This Jet Ski racing game is easy to play but difficult to master.  Anyone can pick it up and have fun playing it.  makes the local split screen awesome as a fun party game.  The music is great, some kinda trance music, but its very relaxing oddly for a racing game and fits with the atmosphere real well.  The waves are amazing, even the other racers sorta leave wakes or mess with the wave physics it seems.  The developer is active on the forums which is helpful, and the controls are fluid and great with a controller.  There is a thing called VR challenges, like Mirrors Edge and others games, if someone in your friends list on steam raced that challenge, you can race their ghost to beat their time.  Its fun playing against other friends ghosts.  There are online matches with a small community of players but like any game if looking for online races can always ask in the forums to add more friends to play online together.  The community seems very friendly for this game.Like ski games, there are jumps you can do tricks on and there are TONS of tricks.  For a race game this should be a must have since there are ten million car racers, but for being the only jet ski racer, its pretty AWESOME!Rating:   10/10  Value:  $19.99			",2651,1115,101,266,362,29,398

												First off, don't let the fact that this was originally a moble game turn you off.  In my opinion, if a game is good it can exist on any platform and still be a good game so it doesn't matter what platform it originally came out on.  With that in mind, lets review.If you were ever a fan of Jet Moto, Sled Storm, or any other arcade stunt/racing games you'll find yourself remembering the great times you had with those games within Riptide GP2.  What the game lacks in graphics it more than makes up for in fun.  While I say that keep in mind that although the graphics might not be up to par with the current generation of games they are still fairly decent.  Furthermore, the action is smooth and I've never experienced any slow ups or lag while playing.Physics wise the gameplay is loose.  Don't expect a realistic simulation of jet skis or water racing here.  Instead you'll find a more arcade style of gameplay physics which is, once again in my opinion here, a nice refreshing change from all the hyper-realistic gameplay that many other games try to convey.  Not that I don't enjoy some realism in my games, but sometimes its nice to just kick back and not worry about all of that.In terms of general gameplay expect to have a blast trying to get the best time while performing some crazy stunts.  The stunt system is fairly detailed and stunts are set by your level, which gives you a chance to make your character your own.  Other customizable features are the ability to choose the colors of your ride and your rider.  It's not super detailed, but enough to make it your own.  The courses in the game seem well laid out and there's a wide variety of racers to choose from which you buy and upgrade using money you earn while racing.There is selection of multiplayer options within the game which was somewhat unexpected.  First up is your standard online multiplayer.  I've raced others a handfull of times and the action is always smooth and fun.  Second is the race for time multiplayer in which your times on each course are sent out to your friends where upon they can race a ghost of your gameplay.  This is a nice option for those who may want to compete against others who may be on a different time scale than others.  Finally there is a multiplayer split screen option for up to four players.  Personally I have not tried this option yet and found it fairly unusual but nice within a PC game.Overall the game is a lot of fun if your not looking for realistic racing action.  There's at least as much content within the game as there was in any of the Jet Moto games and in my opinon is well worth the price of admission.  If your looking for some simple fun races with plenty of options to play with friends you've got to try Riptide GP2.			",200,48,1,38,24,4,28

												Boat racing? Vector Unit? Count me in!Vector Unit, the developer behind this game, are responsible for the very excellent XBLA game, Hydro Thunder Hurricane. If you're a boat racing fan, be sure to check that one out. It's on Windows 8 for PC and XBLA for Xbox 360, of course.This was a mobile game, and you can tell in some places, but it's a very, very good PC port. It has everything you need. Plenty of graphics options, automatic controller/keyboard support, all that stuff.The mobile stuff (optional auto-acceleration feature) is in there, but it's fine.The graphics have been enhanced from the mobile version, and they look really good. If you haven't played the original version, then you'll be in for a treat. The art is fantastic, as in every VU game.The music... It's beautiful! There are a couple of tracks I don't care for, but there are a few more I just absolutely adore.VU, I want a soundtrack to buy!It's kind of modern sounding. Not really dubstep, but close to it. I hate dubstep, though, so that's kind of odd. It's just really nice to listen to. For me, at least.There are 12 tracks, and they all have a unique theme. Pretty to look at, but you don't have much time for that in this game. It's extremely fast-paced. Stop for a second and you're going to lose.There are a few shortcuts/alternate routes on (some of?) the tracks, but they're not the main point of the game. If that's what you love about boat racing/Hydro Thunder, then you won't really find much here.But no, one of the main points of the game is to memorize and pull off cool stunts in the air to gain boost to go faster and beat your opponents. (In some cases, the clock is the opponent as well)There is a TON of customization for your boats. Basic stuff like paint, upgrades, etc, but still, quite a bit of customization. So if you're into that, then I can assure you, it's on full display here.The career mode is simple. You just play the various events, try to do your best, earn 1-3 stars per event, and use those stars to unlock further events to complete your career.There's a time trial mode, and if you are a big nut for that kind of thing (like myself) then this game will offer endless replay value for you. Gotta keep trying to shave off a hundredth of a second here, another hundredth of a second there, and so on...There's also split/screen multiplayer for up to 4 players! That's a fantastic feature that virtually no PC games have anymore. (I think) it only allows controllers in split/screen mode, though, so be prepared to gather up all your controllers, heh.The online multiplayer is fun. I hope a lot of people end up buying this game, because we need to have more consistently full (6 player) matches! 1v1 can be fun but that's not how I want to play online boat racing. :(Last, but not least, we have the controls...They're OK. I'm used to games like Hydro Thunder, Split/Second, Burnout, and so on. The controls in this game aren't quite as... tight? responsive? as you're probably used to. You just have to hold down a bit longer than most games to get a tight turn. The track design plays OK with this kind of control, though, so it's pretty much all good. The main thing is just you, yourself, getting used to the controls. After you do that, they're fine.Overall, I'd say 8.5/10. It's boat racing with a huge emphasis on tricks and boost, not too much else. Made originally for mobile devices, so it's not a very complex game with crazy twists and turns and huge variety, BUT it's still a very good game. Well made, fun to play for a while (especially if you like multiplayer or time trialing), and so on. The game has a nice style and charm to it, but I'm a huge boat racing fan so I may be biased. You'll have to try it for yourself.For $10 dollars ($7 during launch week) I consider it a steal, but that's just me.I can't wait to see Vector Unit's next game! :)			",240,33,21,9,17,2,22

												I loved the original Wave Race and have been looking for something to scratch that particular itch for a while now. Make no mistake, this is a budget game and I originally played it on my mobile. The transition onto PC has worked pretty well and the game definitely benefits from using a controller. The graphics, sounds and music are well implemented although I use SweetFX to further enhance the visuals.The core structure of the game is simple;  compete in various types of challenges to earn stars and unlock new events. Competing also earns currency and skill points. The former can be used to purchase and upgrade racing craft while the latter allows new tricks/stunts to be earned. When stunts are performed, a boost meter is filled allowing a considerable pick up in speed. This becomes essential for staying competitve in later stages.The hydro jets interact well with the dynamic water surface which ultimately leads to a fairly satisfying and enjoyable experience. The controls also respond in a consistent and fairly believeable way.On the down side, the races are a little short (2-3) laps and the courses fairly similar (mainly closed but some which are more open). I hope that this issue is addressed should Riptide 3 be made.If you can pick this up on sale, it's a firm recommendation if this type of game appeals to you.			",294,18,50,12,22,3,27

												What a nice surprise!!!Cruisin'my libray I stumbled upon this hidden gem of a game and I can safely say that ever since Wave Race 64, or arcade racers of the early 00s like Hydro Thunder, I hadn't played anything like this. Unlike those great gems of old, Riptide GP2 offers a deep career with both pilot and vehicle upgrades, you can also purchase new jet bikes and customize them. Music is just great, reminiscing of Wipeout or Motorhead, sounds, while basic, do their job. Graphics are up to modern standards with the reflections on the water being very realistic and bike handling at the very least obeys basic water physics. If you have played those classics I mentioned, then you know what this is about and there is no excuse for you to not have this, if you don't, hey, it's not that expensive, jump in, the waters are great.

												It's a PC port of a mobile game and most of the time I would say stay for away from them but this one is really good.Basically if you were a fan of the JET MOTO and HYDRO THUNDER games as a kid you will probably get a bit nostaligic when playing this, now i wouldnt say this game has the physics down like those games but its still a fun arcade style Water Jet styled racing game the tracks are fun the tricks are easy to do but you can still fail at them enough to make them not OP and the soundtrack is dubstep which normally I hate but it works for this game.As far as the graphics and look of the game goes its pretty good the water looks amazing a few of the jets looks weird but I think that was because of the color and not a graphics issue. The single player is fun and the only real downsde is there isn't much of a community to play the online races but thats no fault of the game just a lack of a community.All in all it's a fun racing game to play which unfortunately there is a serious lack of for PC games and at $5 it's a good price but it seems to go on sale frequently as well.8.5/10 ",354,54,29,31,21,4,30

												For the price of this game, I can't believe how good this is. I would've expected this to be at least a 15 dollar game. I'm so happy I got it. The game takes no time to load, it's fun to pick up and easy to play. plenty of cool tricks to be done, lot of different hydrojets to use, and plenty of different tracks to race on. Not only that, there's also freestyle matches, elimination races, and hotlap races to keep thing different and not boring. 9/10 Great game... now buy it...			",87,6,7,12,10,0,1

												Well this is not a new idea what the developers have created.but bringing it back and looking fresh and making it different from the rest of racers out there they get a  10 out of 10 for sure. I hope to see some new dlc and am pretty impressed that the game is small and makes the retry race ever so fast.as i'm writing this i have 2.5 hrs of game play on it. i'm sure i'll be reaching 30 ^_^hope this helps someone out there make the right chouce in buying a game. chow ^^			",1248,519,51,150,123,21,194

												I have never thought I could get so much fun out of a game that cost less than 10 bucks! This game was an intant classic for me and I still play it a lot. Get it and you won't regret it! Basically the objective of the game is to beat the other guys to the finnish line, and to get there quicker you will perform a combination of stunt combos (of your choosing from the many options) so that you get a speed boost on your bike/Jetski/Hoovercraft/pod. The more complex the stunt, the more speed boost it will get you, and this system will make both a racer and a stunt master out of you.I was surprised to see how well it runs on a Win 8.1 machine, especially because it was originally made for tablets, yet the PC version is well polished and the controls are smooth. I also find the concept to be VERY atractive, the racing style is super fun, and the bikes are very awesome. As you progress through the game, you will start to make lots of money which you will use to buy more bikes and to upgrade them to beastly set ups. I find that only three bikes were actually critical to have (Lanzer, Manta, and Scorpion) but that may be a personal thing. Still you will likely get all the bikes and upgrades since there seems to be nothing else to do with your money. For those of you that prefer console style controllers the game accepts XLinput Xbox 360 style controllers, though I wholly prefer the mouse and keyboard for this game, this of course is a personal preference. If you are into arcade games, then you really need to give this game a try!			",174,16,8,18,11,0,22

												""Riptide GP2"" is an ebullient, restaurant-style arcade racer. It offers those simple controls and that cheeky nonrealism, where the racers and their jetskis can collide with walls and merely stop in their tracks like titanium buoys. Players can pick up easily on the accelerator and steering, while taking in plenty of handsomely lit, futuristic environments and arena-size music. (It makes EDM the sound of tomorrow - today!) I also want to say, this is the first game I've played since ""Super Mario Sunshine"" that made me notice how spectacular its water effects are.It can be hard to anticipate a turn or a bumpy water surface, and coming in third place for the thirty-seventh time is frustrating. But the strategy offered by the stat-balancing customization system and the expandable stunt list is alleviating. I could recommend it just for its presentation value and accessibility, but the strategy in how you can enhance your racing machine is what puts ""Riptide GP2"" over the top.			",36,8,1,4,0,0,1

												I have mixed feelings about this game. I want to like it more than I do and that is mostly due to the nostalgia I have for Splashdown and Splashdown Rides Gone Wild from the PS2. Those games were just plain fun and they both looked and played awesome. I was hoping this game would fill that void but it doesn't. This game looks really nice but the gameplay itself is lacking in fun. Until you race many times and upgrade your first jet ski, you will really need to work hard to get even one of the three stars. The turning is just so sluggish that you are really struggling to find a good line. So until you upgrade, the ski handles like molasses.Next - the boost. There is no control to it - once you hit it, it all expends. You can't control it in bursts - it's all or nothing. That's just poor. The tricks are pretty neat but you seldom have the amount of air required to do really nice combos. I won't give up on it because it isn't terrible, it just isn't as fun as those PS2 games were and still are. And that's just a shame, with all the power available in a PC nowadays. Devs really need to remember how games still need the fun factor to be a hit.			",237,189,34,6,13,4,27

It's the exact same thing.  Keep racing for money to upgrade new jets.  If you like Moto GP or Hydro Thunder, or Jet Moto 2, then you'd probably appreciate this game.Then I find out Vector Unit made Hydro Thunder Hurricane on XBLA too and i LOVEEEE that game.

It doesn't have the zany ""Goofy Golf"" style of amusement that the themed tracks did on HTH, but the tricks used as boosts (which I initially thought I would hate) are loads of fun!  At first, I wasn't sure it was a game I'd stick with...something seemed off.  Then I purchased my first few upgrades on the starter vehicle, and I was hooked!  Upgrades make all the difference.Seriously.  Just buy it.  If you're a fan of HTH, F-Zero games, Wipeout, or even Pod Racer, I can't imagine you wouldn't have fun with this one.

												Riptide GP2 is a fun arcade racer.  With limited customization, limited controls, few tracks, and graphics from ten years ago.  It is not a great game, but it sure is a fun one!  Depending how you spend your credits on upgrades and new jet-ski things, you could find yourself grinding away to earn enough money for what you need to continue.  I would like to see a game like this with more customization, more upgrades (that actually make a noticeable difference), and more tracks (or user generated ones like TrackMania).  Some say this is just a port of the phone version of the game, and it kinda is.  But still, it's pretty fun!I recommend buying this on sale only.The multiplayer currently doesn't function (at least for me and my friends).  Check the forum to see if this has been fixed.

												Want Hydro Thunder on steam?Well, too bad. Microsoft hates you.Riptide GP2 is about as close as you can get for now. Think Hydro Thunder Hurricane meets Waverace meets all those SSX wannabe racers from the PS2.Stunt system is passable if overly simple, no doubt a restriction of having previously been a mobile game. Which also infects the game progression, from the simple 1-3 star rating system (original!) to the way certain events seem geared to making you have to come back to them later upgraded to pass them optimally (I assume to incentivise microtransaction boosts or something in the original game. Though there do not appear to be any microtransactions infesting this version, thankfully.). Control also leaves a little to be desired, as its designed originally to have auto-acceleration (though you can choose to manually accelerate in this version), it kind of reduces some of the nuance you get in games where you aren't expected to be going flat out constantly.Overall though, if you are looking for a cheap fun arcadey water-based racer, you can't go far wrong with this. My issues are honetly minor and easily looked past.Now if only the original Hydro Thunder, Hydro Thunder Hurrican and 4Wheel Thunder where on steam :'(			",773,172,45,94,44,6,86

												In 1996 Nintendo really nailed that feeling of racing on something that felt like water in Waverace64Roll forward almost 2 decades and this - doesn't do that.It's pretty obvious from the first handful of races that this is a racer with not a jot of original content - a phoned-in game in the worst sense.The water is just a visual effect, you just race as you would on land against (cheating) AI doing canned tricks (there's no skill to pulling-off/landing tricks, they take a preset time so you either land or crash depending on whether you had that much time or not) earning money to give yourself a SLIGHTLY better chance against AI which continues to cheat (use your boost - watch as they overtake you anyway!!)It's impossible to recommend a game which fails to do anything new and indeed does a lot of things less well than a game old enough to drink in most places ;0			",606,162,56,93,89,4,107

												Very addictive and fun. I have this game on both my computer and my iOS device. The physics in the game feel so real you almost feel the spray of the water as you jump off each wave. Single Player mode is fun, but as other comments might relate, there is almost no multiplayer community. However, the computer-based opponents are actually intelligent unlike many other racing games, and there is a split screen mode so you can play with your friends on the same machine. The fact that it is water-based instead of land-based has a surprising effect on the game and gives it a very different feel than most other games in general. NVIDIA Stereoscopic 3D works well, too, for those that are interested in testing out your 3D setup.			",14,3,6,0,9,0,5

												So, I have not played the game much, but from what I have played, seems like a pretty solid game.  Feels like F-Zero from back in the old days with a touch of the X=Games sport trick games.  Like Tony Hawk/Matt Hoffman games on a jetski. hahaThe controls feel pretty solid, especially with using the Xbox wireless controller.  Acceleration and breaking just feels more natural having variable pressure triggers.  The game itself seems pretty basic, like most racing games: enter race, the higher you score; the more points/money you get; use money to upgrade your vehicle, etc.  You also have the one added element, you have a XP based level, and as you up your level, you earn points to unlock tricks you can do when you hit a ramp.  The higher your level and more points you get, the better the tricks.  All around, for the price it's a pretty cool game; not necessarily for playing for hours on end, but awesome if you want something different to play while taking  a break from the regular lineup.

												Though I only have a 35 min in the game, I have it on my LG android device, and have never uninstalled from my phone. This release on steam however is a must have if you remember classics such as Jet Moto 1, 2, and 3 for PS1 and Hydro Thunder made by Midway. The controls are solid and the interface no longer feels like its ment for touch screen, The music fits perfectly with the water tracks and at least for makes me want to win. Graphics arent everything in my mind but if the game mechanics are solid with the added visuals then thats a potent combination for me this title has that.

Nice to look at!The Avatars, buildings, and background graphics though are not up to the standards of the latest games, but,Are rendered in a clear, sharp perhaps 18 bit standard.

												Riptide GP2 does not project a positive introduction.  The initial bike is slow and has terrible turning capability.  To make matters worse I found the rumble to be too subtle and though the water is aesthetically pleasing the surrounding graphics are not PC acceptable though the cheap price mitigates this complaint.   There is nothing fun about the game during this phase.Eventually through the acquisition of additional bikes, tricks and abilities the game hooks you and I found myself hooked, eagerly awaiting to participate in the next event.  A high compliment indeed.  Let it be noted that my first purchased bike was a mid range bike named as the ""Lancer"", essentially not exercising the option to purchase any of the slower bikes and this may be the reason why I did not experience the need to grind for cash as reported by other players on the game's forum.  The selection of the Lancer also is probably why the game hooked me as well given it's well balanced attributes and significant performance boost over the initially allocated bike.  A fun phase of the game to be sure.Ultimately you will elevate to the more powerful bikes and upgrades for these bikes will just about maximize the bike's attributes (acceleration, power, handling and boost) and this is where the game falls apart as Riptide GP2 is a mobile port housing tracks which are CRIMINALLY too small for the higher end bikes.  It is at this point in the game which should be the most fun but Riptide GP2 winds up as a literal fish out of water as you find yourself constantly crashing and performing tricks into walls.  Some may argue the need to know the track and boost accordingly but the game became significantly arduous.   The developer Vector Unit has a good lineage with water racing games (XBLA Hydro Thunder) and should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for not putting the effort into extending the size the tracks for the PC platform.  A hall of shame inductee for sure because during the advanced stages, Riptide GP2 should be glorious and instead outed itself as nothing more than a huge washout.			",2426,1048,114,292,316,28,430

Riptide GP2WARNING: THIS GAME IS A MOBILE PORT, and a good one!Pros:+ Good amount of tracks.+ Nice amount of Jet Skis (and they are well designed).+ Upgradable and customizable Jet skis (Only ski and rider colors are customizable).+ Nice Graphics(considering it's a mobile port).+ Cool trick system, with a good variety of tricks to pull off.+ Good arcade handling.+ Fun career mode, with a decent length. (took me 6hrs to get all the stars)+ Good variety of race modes+ Male and female rider option.+ Good water physics.+ Good AI.+ Works great with the xbox360 controller.+ Cheap.+ Has Steam Cards.Cons:- The difficulty and grind in the beginning can make beginners give up on the game (I almost did.)- ""Meh"" Sound design and Soundtrack.- The ""use all at once"" boost system.- A few grinding.- No difficulty setting (And the game is quite hard).- No option to customise races in Single Player (amount of laps, AI, and difficulty)- Sometimes the water glitches and can make you lose a second or two.- Trick races can be frustrating.- Dead Multiplayer.- MP achievements.- The only way to fall off the Ski is by failing a trick (even huge head-on crashes won't make you fall).	The game was ported from mobile but IMO It does not affect its quality.It's a good indie racing game, that reminds me of the classic water racing games of the 90's, and I can recommend it if you can get it with a nice discount.

												TLDR:  Simple, fun, and just the right amount of challenge... Pros:- Controls are good and dead easy to use. Yes, they are!- Water is pretty realistic and bouncy.- Achievement system is realistic and achievable in 10 hours (to complete the game)- Earning money, XP and new hydro jets do not require much grinding, they progress naturally.- Simple hydro-jet upgrades.Cons:- Multiplayer yet to be updated.- It is perhaps a little bit too simple, especially if you demand more complexity from a racing game.- Maps are simple, short and repetitive. I didn't find this much of a problem though since most racing games are pretty repetitive to me anyway. There is enough variety here to make you play differently (e.g. the icy tunnels are much trickier to boost through).- Music is alright, though apparently is an iffy rip off of some stock-soundtrack (source: TB's review)- Is looked down upon for being a mobile port (yet I personally feel this is irrelevant)Result:This game is great for anyone who wants some fun hydro-jet racing to pass the time or complete achievements, without having to grind for money or upgrades. Even better to play with friends, though up to 10 hours worth of entertainment if you do it solo.However I wouldn't recommend this game if you already like other racing games because the chances are you will find complaint with the lack of maps, detail, challenges and engine customization.

This game's fast paced with good graphics, a variety of stunts that have to be unlocked, and plenty of fun maps with a good but small assortment music.  Don't discredit this game for being a port from phones, it's a good game.  The only let down is that you may not be able to unlock the multiplayer achievements without some friends to play with.

												Follow my curation : http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9273374-exorioGot Riptide GP1 on Android, and I like it. Although it's not perfect by any means, but it's a fun game to play. When I saw Riptide GP2 I was considering to buy it on Android as well, but sadly the IAP turns me off.Then I saw this on the holiday auction, and seems it's safe from any IAP/DLC or some sort like its Android counterpart. Glad I won the auction, and even though I had it for free, this game is worth every pennies of its full price.Update after couple of hours playing and went through the career :Online play is empty, and none of my friends own this. But it has splitscreen for local multiplayer and that is kinda nice.Comparing this to Riptide GP1, there're tons of improvements. Controls feel much more snappier, RPG elements (buy skills and upgrades). The stunt moves are very vast and fun to use.Must buy even on its full price!			",299,33,12,22,15,2,27

Riptide GP2 has that classic old school feel to water racing games, while being able to unlock achievements, gain money to purchase new jetskis and upgrades, change your paint and character suit colors.

												This game is a fair upgrade from the previous version -- specifically the water physics is significantly better.  More watercraft to choose from, 13 tracks, and some nice graphical effects.  Water splashes on the camera.  Loads of acrobatic tricks to unlock.  Post times and challenge your friends to beat your mark -- you can even watch their ghosts as you make your run.I'll recommend it for kids and people looking for a casual racer, but not for someone who is a hardcore racing fan or anyone bothered by shoddy physics.[ONLINE MULTIPLAYER PROBLEMS]I tried and failed on numerous occasions to get the on-line multiplayer to work.  There's no loading screen or menu, it just launches you into a game with seven random guys and then sits there trying to make all the pings match up.  I have yet to be able to actually race anyone else, so if you're looking for multiplayer racing, skip.[MENUS]The options menu leaves a lot to be desired.  There are no resolution options; their ""resolution"" area actually changes the fidelity -- not the resoltion.  My advice is to ALT+TAB out of the game -- which will make it a window -- and then size it as you see fit.  Also, I wish it had some sort of plot where it was you versus the other racers; the others are just names on computers.[PHYSICS]The water in this game is great.  When an opponent flies by you, he leaves a wake -- forcing you to make corrections or hit the wall.  However, while more beautiful and realistic than the first GP, the remainder of the physics leave a lot to be desired.[AUDIO]The audio is a mixed bag.  When you're in caves, the sound changes and you can hear the other riders better.  It's neat when you're so far out in front that all you can hear is yourself.  With that said, the guys over at Vector Unit need to google ""cavitation"" and ""doppler effect"".[MISC]Unlike the first game, there's no running the courses in reverse.  There's a reason why you can't run them in reverse, but I won't spoil that.  It's worth mentioning, though.  Finally, your riders are very stiff in their animations -- as if they were statues.  They could use some more animation.All-in-all, it's a quality racing title and a ton of fun.  Feel free to friend me and see if you can beat my times.			",55,22,1,10,28,4,14

												Great little arcade racer! Nothing new under the hood but just fun to play. Level up, earn skillpoints to unlock new cool tricks, earn money to buy hydrojets, upgrade them and customize the look of your hydrojet and rider. You have races, time attacks, elimination and freestyle events to compete in. Witch each trick you perform, you earn boost. The complexer the trick, the more boost you earn. With boost you can speed up your hydrojet for a short period of time and/or perform other tricks.  In each level you can earn 3 stars. With these stars you unlock new events. There's also multiplayer but at the time of writing there aren't that many players around. But that may change since the game just came out on Steam. The AI is however still great to race against and the career mode is de core part of the game.  The games runs really smooth and fast. The loading times are barely noticeable. Don't expect mind blowing graphics but the game still looks pretty good, especially the water and the waves. It also has nice catchy soundtrack. Well worth the money in my opinion.

												If you like games like ""Jet Moto"", ""Wave Race"" and ""Hydro Thunder"" then there's a good chance you'll like this game too.This is my first time reviewing a game on Steam and I've been buying and playing Steam games for almost a decade now.I don't think this game is on the same level as the three I mentioned above, but it's really fun and if you've been looking for a game to scratch that JetSki/Hydro Racer itch then this game will scratch that itch!It's difficulty is pretty balanced, not too hard, but not too easy either.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it's kinda hard to maneuver the turns in the beginning, but after a few races I realized that if I pay attention to the waves of the water, I can actually maneuver better, not to mention that there will inevitably be better upgrades and rides after I level up a few times.I also noticed that it has a Split Screen Mode, Online Mode and other options in case you don't want to stick with the career mode all the time.Online Mode had no one online sadly, but I'm sure splitscreen can rectify that if you invite your friends over to play!Like I said, I only just started playing this game and for the price, it's AMAZING!  It could easily be a $15 game!So if you want a solid fun hydro-racer, try this out, you'll not be disappointed!			",1278,532,41,109,91,5,111

												WOW, first impressions for ~6 hours.  IF you like arcade sytle racers, Nail'd, Pure, Need for Speed, F-Zero, Jet Moto type of racers then this is a game you want.-Great price, didn't expect such quality.-Good vatiations with a few dozen tracks.-Great graphics, including water interaction.-Good upgrade system.-Good music.-Only criticism is maybe a mode that is less arcade with more braking rather than full throttle most of the time. I'm sure with more upgrades to speed it will not allow full-throttle racing on turns. Wish you could use your Turbo in small doses than force to use it ALL at once so need long straight paths if did a good trick to get a longer boost. I do like how the settings allow auto-throttle so no need to hold down R2 until your hand hurts lol, just hard to break hard. Also more alternate paths or shortcuts to have to discover would be a plus too.  9.5/10 for the price.			",313,64,48,19,11,3,23

												Fun, mildy challenging racing game. Mechanics are great, looks great, but it can be annoying sometimes. The amount of money you earn is more or less on par with how much you have to spend on upgrades in order to win races, so that's not a problem, like with many other similar games. I personally got kind of impatient to get a new vehicle, so I ground out a lot of credits on a lower level race in order to do so, but if I had waited, the amount of money I earned in the next tier would have made it far easier and faster, so getting new jets isn't too hard either, but it can be a little difficult to decide whether to keep upgrading your current one or to buy a new one. I enjoy this game a lot, and am a bit less than halfway through. Easiely worth $10, even though I haven't even tried any of the multiplayer functions yet.			",63,2,6,6,4,1,4

												Looking for an arcade game that can play on your older non-gaming laptop which is both fun and great to play in bursts?Well, you've found the right game that will fit those needs!I myself snagged 4 copies of this game to share with friends because hey, what's more fun than playing with several buddies together? The game is simple but very fun. You can upgrade your ride and purchase, with in-game-currency (not in-app-purchases) which is relatively easy to get and there are the classic multiplayer options: split-screen and online. There is also a VR mode, which I haven't tried. Whatever it is.Graphics are pretty good too, considering this game, as far as I remember started out on Smartphones before coming to Steam. Whether you have friends to play with or like playing solo for some short bursts of fun, Riptide GP2 has all you need without the extra storage space most games require you to have to play.

												As you probably already know Riptide GP2 is a port of a mobile game.  I have tried the mobile version of this in my occasional hunting for a phone game worth playing that always ends in a solid ""mobile games just aren't for me"" verdict.  That was the same when trying this.  The whole time on my phone I thought man if only I had a controller this would be pretty sweet.  Well what do ya know, it is.  Some of the Hydro Thunder team actually worked on this game as well.  Now that has been a fairly sporadic series at best.  There were three games if I recall corectly.  A N64 one, an arcade one that I blew WAY too much money on as a kid, and the Xbox Live Arcade Summer of Arcade title ""Hydro Thunder Hurricane"".  I can honestly say that Riptide is best described as a tamed down version of Hydro Thunder on jetskis.  There you go.  Review over.  Just kidding.The soundtrack was a dubstep mix on my iTunes in the background, because the stock soundtrack is decent, but it's pretty samey pretty quick.  The skis themselves have an almost formula 1 sound to them that's pretty cool and especially shines when one of the AI rubber bands right past you to take the win at the last second.So yeah about that, the worst and I meen Godforsaken sin evil worst thing is this games INSANE rubber banding.  I almost gave up in the beginning it's so bad.  I could not win a race.  Why?  Because I was doing stunts to earn boost and going flat out the whole time like that games tool tip screens tell you to do.  Why does that make you lose?  Because like many games with rubber banding it just doesn't matter how fast you go.  In this game, short of a lucky crash on the AI's end, you will never win by more than a second or so.  I very quickly found myself doing enough stunts on the first lap to fill my boost meter, then steering out around every subsequent jump, then purging my boost all as the finish line is coming up.  Once I started doing this I won every single race the first try.  Well almost...  There are three types of events.  Race, which is your standard race.  And once you learn to game the AI at its own thing these become almost trivial.There's also freestyle events, which sucks and is sucky and the games trick system isn't bad but the freestyle events somehow many to still just be boring.  Mainly due to the fact that you never find jumps big enough for actual combos.  You just bust out your moves and work through them so you aren't punished for repeating tricks.  This is not challenging at all.  What is, is leveling your character up enough to actually purchase the tricks that earn enough points to even have a hope of anything beyond 3rd place in the freestyle events.  Sound like leftover mobile game with in app purchases grinding to you?Next we have the elimination events.  Now these are by FAR the most interresting events.  Though they left me frustrated quite a few times by the earlier mentioned overly-rubber-bandy-AI.  They are interresting though because the Race mode strategy of hang back and dump boost at the final stretch just doesn't work.  Ever.  You will actually have to consistently fill your boost bar and use it every time you find yourself in the rear of the pack with the 5 second warning of an elimination flashing on your screen.  This keeps these events feeling far far more edge of your seat than the other two.  The only issue I had was that more often then not I still just felt cheated into a 2nd or 3rd place finish due to the AI absolutely FLYING by me at the last second while I was boosting... All the while they are on a Ski that according to the stats page in your garage should never be passing you in a dead straightaway.So all in all, why did I still sink 4 hours into this game?  It's addicting.  Cough, mobile hooks?  I wanted one of the bad A final skis as soon as I saw them.  The problem was, once I got one, the game was literally boring immidiately.  I had the final Ski less than halfway through the game's championship events.  Granted I had done a bit of backtracking, reracing old events because you 100% half to in order to upgrade your ride enough to win the events to unlock further ones.  I can only assume that the mobile version will allow you to skip this buy purchasing the upgrades with real money.  So yeah, I just don't know.  Is it worth it?  Well if you pay the full price of $7... Eh, I really don't think so.  I got this in a sale for $1 and felt satisfied.  At that point you have to ask if its worth your time.  I personally REALLY love the Hydro Thunder games and have a weird gamer fetish for driving anything on some nice pretty water.  The completionist in me hates that I will never finish this.  But the realist in me says.. ""Yeah, that was 4 hours well spent.  I enjoyed that for the most part.""  So  this is pretty inconclusive, but I hope that my insight here helps you work out for yourself if this port is still worth a look.			",287,65,32,25,29,3,42

												   There is something addicting to this game. You just feel the need to be the very best, so you race and race and race until you have aquired three stars on that pesky level.   Anyway, good graphics, can't say there is a story or anything (you just race and race and race). Something I find odd: sometimes the game (I think) doesn't detect what I press on the controller (Xbox 360 wireless).   Good game, I recommend this game 10/10.			",45,1,5,2,3,0,3

												Do you like Hydro Thunder?  Hydro Thunder is one of the greatest racing games of all time, let's be honest.  It would take a lot for a game to reach its heights.  Riptide GP2 comes close to being as great as that game.Where Riptide GP2 is most like Hydro Thunder is in its controls, game play, and fun factor.  This game is a blast!!!  Oh, and speaking of controls.  I've seen some early reviews of this game stating it doesn't allow you to control acceleration, and instead auto-accelerates like the tablet version.  This isn't the case.  It offers you both types of control, so you can manually control your speed if you wish.The graphics are great for this game and I'm glad they upgraded them on PC!  This isn't a lazy port of the tablet version.  It all runs buttery smooth and your eyes will be very happy.  However, the graphics aren't as inventive or as diverse as Hydro Thunder; both in tracks and vehicle types.   This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it keeps it from Hydro Thunder greatness.My only gripe about the game is it feels a bit grindy.  It takes a lot of races to unlock tracks and exceptional new vehicles.  Still, this is a minor nitpick.  (Oh, and I shouldn't forget a slightly related nitpick that really makes me clench my fists in anger.  On the Steam page they mention Riptide GP2 comes from the creators of Hydro Thunder Hurricane on Xbox360 and Windows 8.  For someone who refuses to upgrade to the POS Win8, and doesn't want to purchase any games off of XBox live, I'm left, like other Win7 users, out in the cold when it comes to the cool sequel to the beloved Hydro Thunder.  Yeah, rub it in my face.)  Microsoft made a BS move.  But I digress.Got this for half price on a Steam sale, but must say that even at full price, $9.99, this game is well worth it!

												I got this in a nine game bundle for 5 dollars, this may offset my judgement of the game. Judge accordingly.I played the demo on my tablet forever ago but I didn't buy it. I wasn't too keen on it. But here it's a completely different story. There's fast quick fun to be had in this game, and it offers you many opportunities to gain credits as well as level up and learn skills. It's pretty much akin to games that are fast like f zero but the stages are smaller and controls are rightfully more difficult because of water. If you played games like asphalt 8 on the smartphone, you'll see the smoothness in comparison to progression. It won't take long to level and purchase cars, and that makes it very accessible to use. Everyone is saying it's grindy, but it's really not. If you played gran tourismo or even the earlier mentioned asphalt 8. You'll know this game is NOTHING in the fashion of grinding. Play some missions, perfect your time, get credits learn tricks. If you grind too much, you'll have most of the gear before chapter 3 probably. So quite literally it's still a smartphone game but it's on a less intrusive platform. In my opinion, that, paired with the fact that it's not a car racing game makes it fun to play and a great way to kill time with quick races and beautiful graphics. For ten dollars, not so much unless you really like it, but this is steam. You really should try for a deal.			",593,159,18,80,29,5,66

Can go all shiny like.Can change gender of rider and customize paint jobs for jetskis and riders;Very good music;// All a mix of dubstep/electronica. Can perform many interesting stunts;//There are like 20 different muscle spams that can be performed, even a rockstar finisher.How the player uses boost actually matters;// can use boosts to get out of corners, ram others, or boost to arrange better jumps to get more.has local and abroad multiplayer;// split screen for up to 4 players, play internet strangers, or compare scores via VR mode.is a very well done port that incorporates PC controls;// menus are easy to navigate. not perfect but still an A- for effort and execution.}Cons{Can become trapped on ramps;//rare but very annoying.braking is practically useless;//max handling skill and keep right triggler depressed ftw.The variety of vehicles is limited; // by that I mean there are 3 ultimate vehicles and the rests are just stepping stones.//best ones I've found are Lancer, Manta, Scorpion, play anything else for personal challenge.No soundtrack released or ability to easily yank from game files;Upgrade system for vehicles has too much of an impact on difficulty;// They truly do make a HUGE difference in vehicle performance.Can't change game's resolution;Always start in last place.//Artificial way of making difficulty. Deeply annoying in hot lap races where timer starts immediately.}			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

So  this is pretty inconclusive, but I hope that my insight here helps you work out for yourself if this port is still worth a look.			",287,65,32,25,29,3,42

												Fun arcadey racer to play. It is a nice twist to have it on water instead of on the road. Beautiful graphics. Reminds me of Trials Fusion a little, but on water. Has split screen and online multi-player. Looks great on triple monitor too. I look forward to new games by this publisher.			",132,13,16,10,13,1,5

												I have never been more pleasantly suprised by the depth of a game (for its price) than with Riptide GP2. The career system is LONG and it actually makes you work to unlock and beat the different cups. I believe there are 8 or 9 of them. Also, the music in this game is phenomenal and really sets the mood for the type of game it is. Loud EDM-inspired music that works perfectly in the races. 9/10 score.			",41,2,2,2,2,0,0

												Pros{I found the game Fun; // and I'm a pain in the butt to please.Variety of stages, all of which are beautiful.//the track intros would make  good screen savers.Graphics are around PS3 quality;// It actually has graphics options so YAY! Can go all shiny like.Can change gender of rider and customize paint jobs for jetskis and riders;Very good music;// All a mix of dubstep/electronica. Can perform many interesting stunts;//There are like 20 different muscle spams that can be performed, even a rockstar finisher.How the player uses boost actually matters;// can use boosts to get out of corners, ram others, or boost to arrange better jumps to get more.has local and abroad multiplayer;// split screen for up to 4 players, play internet strangers, or compare scores via VR mode.is a very well done port that incorporates PC controls;// menus are easy to navigate. not perfect but still an A- for effort and execution.}Cons{Can become trapped on ramps;//rare but very annoying.braking is practically useless;//max handling skill and keep right triggler depressed ftw.The variety of vehicles is limited; // by that I mean there are 3 ultimate vehicles and the rests are just stepping stones.//best ones I've found are Lancer, Manta, Scorpion, play anything else for personal challenge.No soundtrack released or ability to easily yank from game files;Upgrade system for vehicles has too much of an impact on difficulty;// They truly do make a HUGE difference in vehicle performance.Can't change game's resolution;Always start in last place.//Artificial way of making difficulty. Deeply annoying in hot lap races where timer starts immediately.}			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great electronic music, awesome graphisms and realism, terrific water effects. If you're looking for a race game both original and giving you adrenaline, then this game will suit you.The only bad points are you cannot edit keys which is pretty annoying and the lack of more maps which results in a more boring game. The main objective would basically be to upgrade the engine again and again until you win a 3 star race. Well, that disappointed me. I just play for fun, not for competition.However, if you are looking for something relaxing, than opt for it. I still recommend it because it's good overall.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played this on tablet and went - meh. Got it in a bundle so figured I'd give it a go. When played on TV I went - woah! It is a whole different game and should have been made for the console but it is a nice port that rocks on big picture with XBox controllers. Split screen races are so much fun and hilarious with the crazy stunts. Those criticizing this as a lazy mobile port have probably only tried playing it with a keyboard and mouse.Only gripe would be that the local multiplayer matches lack any depth (excuse the pun). Don't get me wrong, it is awesome to have up to 4 players, but there are no options to change the number of laps, choose your player or anything. Races last one lap then switch to the next track. After a while it gets repetitive and it is a shame as this mode has awesome potential. A freestyle vs mode would be good too.			",244,75,19,7,13,5,24

												WOW, first impressions for ~6 hours.  IF you like arcade sytle racers, Nail'd, Pure, Need for Speed, F-Zero, Jet Moto type of racers then this is a game you want.-Great price, didn't expect such quality.-Good vatiations with a few dozen tracks.-Great graphics, including water interaction.-Good upgrade system.-Good music.-Only criticism is maybe a mode that is less arcade with more braking rather than full throttle most of the time. I'm sure with more upgrades to speed it will not allow full-throttle racing on turns. Wish you could use your Turbo in small doses than force to use it ALL at once so need long straight paths if did a good trick to get a longer boost. I do like how the settings allow auto-throttle so no need to hold down R2 until your hand hurts lol, just hard to break hard. Also more alternate paths or shortcuts to have to discover would be a plus too.  9.5/10 for the price.			",313,64,48,19,11,3,23

												For good and bad, the water physics is a lot more like real water in this game than it was in Hydro Thunder Hurricane.  HTH's water felt like jelly.  Also, keep in mind, a boat handles waves better than a jetski.  You could kinda cushion your boat against waves when turning in HTH, whereas in this game, you are punished more for driving across them.  If you're used to HTH, you will not be ""in the groove"" for the first couple races.  However, it doesn't take very long to get used to.  The challenge makes the game feel more rewarding.  This feels like a water racing game trying to be more like Forza than WaveRace - if that makes any sense.  I feel like this is what Gran Turismo would be like if it was the future and the Nurburgring was covered in water.  Those are the kind of games that the steering difficulty remind me of.  At first, I didn't like that, but it's starting to grow on me.  Also, this game is in 60fps, whereas Hydro Thunder on the xbox360 maxed at 30fps.  That's a great thing for a racing game.They're both great games, but different experiences.   This game is totally worth it, though.  Hopefully this review shed some light.			",91,7,2,13,10,0,13

												BUY IF: - you have a room mate, you don't want to learn thousands of tracks and movesDON'T BUY IF: - you want a challenge, you expect different playing styles, you expect a storyGet this game on a sale. It's not worth almost 10 €! The graphics are lousy, the steering knows only two modi (none, full - thank you, touch screen-port) and there are not enough circuits. After three cups, you'll find it repetitive already. The graphics: Wave Race 64 had a rider that moved according to waves. In Riptide GP2, the rider sits like a buddhist monk, no matter what. I can ignore the lousy stands and understand that all venues have the same blueish water but I won't accept the 90esque textures on any main object (jet ski, rider). The surroundings actually look nice. The controls cannot be remapped! Luckily the stunt system is simple and sound (if you combine two moves, the commands will be the same as for the single stunts). The career mode seems to get easier after the second to last cup. It's a fun game because of the split screen-mode. You'll have finished the career mode in 5 hours. After one hour you'll have seen EVERY avaivable track. The races are way too short and you can't set how many laps you want to do. A FREE DLC could make this a decent game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Waverace 64 is one of my two all-time favorite games. I don't even know how many hundreds of hours I have poured into it over the years, along with its Gamecube sequel, Blue Storm. So, don't take it lightly when I say that Riptide GP2 is an absolute joy to play, and to look at (I could do without some of the Dubstep-ish music, but on the whole it is pretty nice as well). Despite the absence of the 'buoy/slalom' features of Waverace- it feels like the completely worthy spiritual successor to my treasured Waverace.

The harder your tricks are the more boost you get. Works great as strategic element.+ hydrojets with different strengths/weakness available+ a race takes 3 minutes at maximum, so you get a lot of playtime in one session.+ brings back memories to good old wave-racer times~multiplayer : to bad it doesn't have a lobby - it's already problematic to get into a game, so online mp might die out pretty soon~sound : trancy music and the lack of water-sounds are improveableTo Sum up: If you are looking for a well made arcarde racer - this might be one of the best games out there!

With the price and amount of content you can't really go wrong. It is cheap to pick up on sale and at it's original price. I recommend to pick this up, you won't be dissapointed with this game.Also I hope you have a controller as I can't imagine the difficulty playing with a keyboard. You use the two joysticks to do tricks when you go off a ramp, better tricks can earn you more points and more boost.Graphics are great, of course nothing amazing.Music get's a little repetive.Controls are excellent.There's really no cons except for like I said the music can get a wee bit repetive.I would give it a 8/10, but  definitely worth every penny if you like arcade racers.

												I own this game for android and I got it for free or paid about or at $1 dollar on that system. I own for it windows 8 in the marketplace because I had free cash from them and it was cheap. I own it for the pc because yet again I got it for peanuts. Bundlestars has this and a bunch of other games on sale for $ 3.40 right now. Its a good bundle. So I do like the game for what it is. The game looks good. Now I watched Total Biscuts WTF is riptide and while he has a point that the game doesnt look great. I will say that it looks good enough. It gets the job done. Is it Hydro Thunder perfect? No. However that game is locked into the windows 8 marketplace so we have this. Also their are not a ton of games out on the pc market that are good on the water racing games. The only good one I can think of is Aquadelic GT on steam besides this one. However this game is not perfect. The courses I wish were longer  and more varied looking. The upgrade system is in my opinion deliberately slow and takes a long time to get a faster jet then it should. The AI is overly fast and that is annoying. I wish for the pc crowd it had more tuning options for the AI. The graphics while good could be a lot better looking. The water effects are good. The splitscreen and multiplayer online is a good feature however I have not tried those out.  So the retail price on this is $7 dollars. I think thats rather steep for what the game offers. Aquadelic GT is cheaper $5 dollars and looks just as good and has more things to do besides just the few meager offerings this game has. In the GT side you can fly a plane or rescue people on with your boat or look for gold in a sail boat.  This game has 3 different type races. So if this game ever goes on sale I would say buy it because its fun and easy to pick up and play. So good game. Should be priced a little lower. Overall I enjoy this game and if it goes on sale pick it up and enjoy.			",299,147,32,35,36,9,44

												    I came to this game when looking for Hydro Thunder (or HT Hurricane) PC version. Some websites allow free downloads, and I'm like ""free virus with every purchase (Viruses are around every corner and you know it)!"" I decided to search it on Steam, because it's very reliable. First and only result was this game. The pictures and the video suggested that this is the closest I could get to HTH, even with some of the same developers, as mentioned in the trailer. $5 is cheap for a video game, which suggests that the quality of the game itself is cheap, and I was partly right. I really liked the water physics and that realistic feel to it, no longer being an arcade game. My praise and concerns are as follows:1. This does NOT support controllers.    My biggest highlight. Even though it says, ""full controller support,"" it isn't. I can't even configure my controls, or use a controller other than an XBOX controller. I primarily use an old Logitech Dual Action controller, in which it has numbered buttons. This is a MAJOR flaw that must be patched. Then again, this is what you get when you pay only $5.2. That grinding feel.    I've noticed the feel of an RPG towards the game. I like the option of having to buy and upgrade jet skis, rather than having to play from skill. It boils down to rerunning races over and over again. Since I'm an RPG fanatic, grinding is my thing. Then again, I don't have much experience in the game, so I could be wrong with anything.3. The tricks.    I like the concept that you could unlock and perform tricks. Things that would need improving on would be implementing more reality. Once I almost finished a trick, but landed on the water, costing me the race. In reality, a real jet ski racer would land the trick, even with half a second of the trick to finish when landed. Then again, you don't see racetracks like that or ramps like that in reality.			",17,0,0,2,6,0,3

												Worth to try Indie water racing game with extreme arcade speeds and incredible tricks, a lot of fun to play its campaign, even more fun to play it online. Unfortunatelly, online mostly all the time is empty.It doesn't lower the fun of this game dou. You can fully customize your waterscooter with custom colours layout as same as your personal character. This game also has nice upgrading system and simple level up function which obviously rises your level everytime you complete a course and gives an deserved amount of in-game money depending on how good you were.There is also scooters in-game shop which is integrated into the upgrading system (no real money purchases are made in this game), so you can upgrade not only speed/handling/boost/acceleration but also get more and more powerful waterscooters from time to time, even if I was completely fine for like 3-4 first Grandprix with the very first scooter after I maxed it out, dou it will get harder and harder to win first place in further progress. It all depends from your skills. It does have 4 in-game modes (I doesn't count Online and or Time Run where you compete against friends ghosts):Trick Moves, Time Run, Elimination and a Regular Races. In general in many points it doesn't fades out from 99.9% other arcade racing games, except it is based on water and the water physics are simulated pretty damn well, but of course it does get boring after some time you will spend playing it, but the good side of it is that it has cards/achievements, a nice highscore system, is enjoyable and you will want to come back to continue the progress. I would recommend this to every player who likes arcade racing games and or just want to play something easy at the time. Verdict:★★★★✩ 4/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very cool game for WaveRace fans or fans of water racing games. I enjoyed WaveRace back in the day. As soon as I saw the video I knew it was a buy. The game itself does not play like a cheap game. It has REALLY solid graphics for a bargain game. 60 races and online play! The only knock I have is I don't have a clue how to pull off skills I've bought with points. I can pull off the basic stuff pretty easily. (Superman dat hoooo lol!!!!)			",94,13,3,8,7,2,2

												A good little game for a small price, reminds me the good old Waverace 64.Pros :- the price- nice, colorfull graphics- several jets to buy, upgrade and customize- you can choose the gender of your pilot- not too difficult, not too easy- new stunts to unlock with a level progressionCons :- dubstep stuck in your head- only a few races that become repetitive- your upgrades matter more than your skill- no vertical control of the jet- too short			",283,30,14,47,16,3,17

												Whilst the 'driving' is well implemented, the 'campaign' is rather poor due to the fact that you have to repeatedly do the same races over and over again to get money to upgrade or buy new vehicles so you can compete in later races.  I know that this is the way of these sorts of games, but this one is really mean with the cash!  Round and round, over and over.  It gets rather boring.  Also, I have not been able to play online as there is no one else playing this game!  I'd give it a 5/10.			",60,8,0,2,15,0,18

												At first, this game seemed pretty alright. The water racing and the tracks reminded me a lot of Hydro Thunder from my Nintendo 64 days. But, after that wore off, it realized it was kind of shallow and lacking in any sort of big fun factor. Here are a list of complaints I have about the game;- Is clearly a mobile port with little to no upgrades- Controls are pretty meh, even for a racing game about driving on water (which I expected to be less tight than a road racer)- Lacks any large fun factor, like high speed or something of the sort.Those are really my main complaints. Don't get me wrong; This actually seems to be a competent mobile game. However, as a PC game, it really isn't anything special or big. Also, nobody plays online. It's pretty cheap so if you wanna try it feel free to, but I would just reccomend trying Hydro Thunder Hurricane on Windows store if you're looking for a nice water racer on PC.			",84,13,13,2,5,0,3

												Basically a port which is done well, with PC-grade visuals, responsive controls (more responsive than the watercraft). Physics are pretty arcade but fits the theme well.The only thing to gripe is the lack of online live multiplayer, but I guess it might be asking for too much...EDIT: Apologies. It does have live multiplayer. I missed that blatantly and I didn't have a chance to test it.			",67,14,5,24,82,1,65

												After looking at the reviews, I was expecting a cross between Nintendo's 'Wave Race' and Midway's 'Hydro Thunder'. What I got feels like a cheap mobile phone game, with absolutely nothing orginal or exciting in it. I've never felt so bored or underwhelmed playing a new game for the first time. I only paid £1 for it, so it's fine, but I still wouldn't recomend it.			",21,1,14,0,1,1,7

												A visually appealing jet ski racer fiddled with poor mechanics / design choices.- Controls, there is barely any user input, there are 4 things you do in this game...steer, turn, boost and do tricks. (Analog sticks, A button, and left trigger)  Most of your gamepad / keyboard is untouched.- Progression System is Flawed, after you get past the first two circuits you will realize that the AI are starting to go much faster than you. You basically have to ""grind"" previously completed tracks to earn money for upgrades just to be able to compete which is tedius. Later on you will max out your first bike, and then realize you need to save up 100k+ for a better bike....(which is simply a time wasting grind)- Only supports 720p resolution, it will go fullscreen, but the game could have looked much better at full HD.- Mobile Port+ A great variety of good looking and visually unique tracks to play on.+ Easy to play / learn for all ages+ Motorcross trick system is pretty fun to use, and cool to watch.+ A lot of content / circuits to play through. (even if it requires a ton of grinding to get through)Overall it's a pretty decent game if you can pick it up for a low price, but I wouldn't reccomend it. ",2897,1025,99,264,346,21,391
