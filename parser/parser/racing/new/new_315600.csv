												Worth a look as look as long as you're ready to accept mid-2000's arcade racer physics. This is no sim. You'll rarely need brakes, there's no damage affecting performance, wall-riding and AI-shepherding is a thing, etc etc. Think NFS Hot Pursuit 2 as a budget title. Once you're over that, the game is quite fun, with a variety of unique gameplay modes and challenges, and a ton of unlockables to keep you coming back for a while.Best control option: Gamepad.

												This is a surprisingly decent racing game, as long as you're okay with it feeling a little dated.What it lacks in realism or modern visual fidelity it makes up for with a level of variety that harkens back to the days of Bizarre Creations racing games like Project Gotham and Blur. They just don't make games like this anymore. Racing games take themselves so seriously, now. So does Ford Racing 3, but you also get to race in a variety of exotic locales that sometimes borderline on being cartoon-ish caricatures. Golden Buddha statues and giant Tiki mask tunnels await you. These are not boring circuit or street races (but those are available, too.)There's also a ton of different event types that move beyond just racing and time trials. Again, it's a lot like Project Gotham in that respect: drive through cones, collect points tokens, practice your drafting abilities and way, way more. There's a lot to do in this game, and a lot of cars to do it with. Trucks, coupes, sport and muscle cars, even concept cars and Model-Ts. Just don't expect Forza. Don't even expect Need for Speed, really. But if you're in the mood for a racing game, this will serve you well enough. It's just not a revolution.			",443,83,23,36,20,4,52

 Ford Racing 3 This game is a classic, many of you might have got this in a cereal box back in the days.  remember that we used to get games in cereal boxes!? I got to be honest, I like that this game have lots of stuff to collect, cars, tracks, trophies, you name it.I even love the retro style, it reminds me of  Need For Speed: Porsche Unleased  and I really loved that game! but for a game released for the Playstation 2 its really bad..you can't crash, you just bounce on the walls or whatever you hit and that makes the game lose some overall score, I love the rush I get then there is a risk and there really is no risk.... Its simple, you win or lose, be faster or push the opponents into the walls, may be too simple, but don't get me wrong, with all these flaws I still like the game, because I relax then playing, I enjoy the beautiful tracks, not just a simple racing track, but a forest, a snowy mountain, I just love it, get it on sale, then its worth it. 5/10  ",150,52,5,18,34,5,26

The two main game modes; competition and challenge, force you through a mix of all of Ford vehicles (which is actually a lot more variety than expected.)  Although limited on graphics there are still nice environments from china, snow and rocky mountains all which have their own proper feel.			",1138,455,88,126,164,17,223

												This really brings me back to the old days. I remember getting this on the ps2. I remember how angry i got when the save data on the ps2 got corrupted. This has aged and the graphics show that but this is your classic old school arcade racer. Its like a low budget nfs game but it plays out pretty well and in the end it gives me that same awesome feeling that i did when i was like 7-8 years old. Crazy how things change in a decade. its worth a shot espeically for a single pound, £1 is a steal. The tracks are simple but are in interesting settings and there is a clear difference between them. granted ive not got a lot of time in it yet its its still doing well.

												This is a fairly average arcade racing game from the PS2 era. The physics aren't great and the graphics have dated (you will need to manually alter the screen resolution from the game's folder in order to stop it stretching things from 4:3 to 16:9), but this game has a few tricks up its sleeve. It has a wide variety of unique game modes and is one of few PC games that supports split-screen multiplayer. The car selection is also great, with a mix of rare classics and unique concepts from Ford's history. Some of these cars (like the Ford GT70 Concept) are literally in no other video games, so if you're a fan of Ford this will definitely get your inner car-nerd excited. Admittedly the performance of these vehicles is not accurate. They're split into classes which supposedly feature similar vehicles, and the vehicles within these are balanced to be competitive with each other. But in the Off-Road class you get a mix of pickup trucks and rally cars, including the formidable Ford RS200 from Group B rallying and the original Ford F-Series from 1948. In reality, these vehicles wouldn't even be close to the same league, but here they can both bring the fight to each other.But the game does have a really nice race and unlocks structure which I really haven't seen enough of in recent games. And at the low price of £4, there's really no reason to not get it if you like these cars.			",72,5,5,3,12,0,16

												I had this game on the PS2 when I was a child. It was difficult at first because I hadn't developed strong driving skills in video games. Despite that, I still enjoyed the game, though I didn't finish the game completely because I couldn't do some of the harder races. Fast forward into today, when I became a better driver, such as playing Gran Turismo, Need for Speed, and Test Drive Unlimited 2 and getting my driver's licence, I still enjoy this game, and only got it for 99 cents. Sure, the game is 10 years old, but one of the best classic games I ever experienced.Overall: If you're a Ford fan, then this game should be fun. There are plenty of cars to race from and from different classes, such as the Model T, Mustangs, F-series trucks, and the supercar Ford GT. There are also a large number of tracks with different terrain and layouts. The game also offers a campain mode as well as a challenge mode. Rating: 9 out of 10.     Though it is fun with plentiful of cars, most of the game is really easy (despite the ""hard"" difficulty) and the crash physics are a bit unrealistic. The graphics are alright, but it's to be expected from an old game.			",12,4,4,1,1,0,3

												As a successor of the famous Ford Racing 2, Ford Racing 3 adds a few more racing modes and a lot of more cars, yet the fun stays the same.Released in 2004, Ford Racing 3 still keeps the same amount of fun in 2016 compared to back when I first got to play it.The number of cars, compared to recent racing games, seemingly is little -- but remember that this game contains some cars you will find in Ford Racing 3 only!The variety of racing tracks goes from idyllic over original to unrealistic, but still fun. One can choose between different locations, and then can choose between the racing tracks, original or reverse.The soundtracks... well, you can disable them and turn on your own music with e.g. Spotify (or whatever you prefer). They surely are not the best on the world, but for 2004 they surely were considered 'good' or 'okay'.The number of racing modes is considerably high -- but there are not any special modes such as Drag or Drift. Just driving, maybe with Boost, maybe with obstacles.Considering that the game is already more than 10 years old, which is obvious for those graphics, I think it is still worth buying it, if you are a Ford-Fan and/or like racing arcardes!Furthermore it is a great reminder of the times you may have spent with playing Ford Racing 2 from a CD you got from a cereal. :)tl;dr: Old game, worth the money because of cars only available in this game.

The screen will be stretched on most modern monitor resolutions but there is a commonly used widescreen fix/.exe that makes the graphics look sharper and better if you search it.

												Looking for a fun, cheap racing game and don't really care about the graphics? Just buy this game.This game was part of your childwood and you still haven't bought it?!?   Insert overused spongebob meme here  Yes, there are many racing games out there that you could buy, but why buy this one?Pros So much fun; Nostalgic experience Many different Cars and Tracks; Good variety of challanges; You can play with/vs your friends They don't give you all Cars and Tracks on the start, you have to earn them by winning challanges/races, wich is a positive thing because you feel rewarded by playing the game.Cons Dated graphics (remember that the game came out in 2004); The game menu doesn't allow you to change the quality of the graphics nor the resolution, so you will need to check the community guides for more information about how to change them; The physics are quite cringy; Good luck getting used to the controls on your keyboard :^) .I TOTALLY recommend you getting this game if it is in discount, you can get it for so little.Keep in mind that Ford Racing 3 isn't a simulator game, more of an arcade one, so just play it and buy it if you want to make your spare time fun or if you want to go back to the old days aboard the Nostalgia Train.Also, if you buy this game and enjoy it, I suggest that you try out Ford Racing 2.

												One Christmas many years ago, my mother got me and my brother a Playstation 2, along with 10 games. The first one we played was an older game about 6 drivers racing in a variety of Ford vehicles in many different parts of the world. And 8 years later, I see that there is a Steam version of it. To this I say.... good game, Steam!I am not sure if this is just nostalgia talking or what, but I cann recommend this game to ANYONE!It looks rather nice in my opinion, there are many things to do, and (if you can find out how, like I did) you change mod this game to the MAX! (I may make some tutorials later :3Many people find it bad because of its ""bumper car-like playstyle."" Even though it has that funny appeal, this game still has that difficulty and funness that every racer to that. And with all that on the table, this game gets the ""Penny Stamp Of Approval""!

												TL;DR: old graphics, old game, but still as fun as some modern day racing games. My suggestion: buy it during the promotions, you won't regret the 99 cents you spent on it.This is *the* game for Ford enthusiasts. For starters, I've had this game for PS2 for a long time now. When I became more connected to Steam and I saw it here, I thought to myself ""I just have to get my hands on it!"". Then I saw all the people here complaining about this or that detail. So is this game imperfect? Yes. But since when do games have to be perfect? The truth is, I had a lot of fun play this game when I was a kid, and I still equally enjoy it now that I have it on Steam. Sure, comparing it to modern day Need For Speed's or the latest ""The Crew"" game, this one doesn't even stand a chance. But for a game almost 10 years old, it's excellent. The cars, their sounds, the tracks, the tricks, the different race types, the lady's voiceover. It's old. But it truly is gold.Pros:- A lot of cars, a lot of tracks, a lot of trophies -- this means a lot of playtime- Different race types makes this game everything but non-repetitive- Old Fords and new Fords (by new, I mean 2005-new) can be found, meaning a game where certain cars can only be found- The lady's voiceover!Cons:- Your profile can only have 3 letters- Gameplay music can be a bit ugh- Graphics are, of course, outdated by today's standardsOverall, I'd give this game a 8/10. It's old, but it's gold baby!			",659,170,50,100,85,15,101

												Really solid arcade racing game. Graphics are a little dated but not too bad, even 11 years after release. Really broad selection of cars and fictional tracks, with a solid single player mode. Physics engine is not very realistic, but is easy to master with arrow keys for controlling.  For $5 or less, it's a bargain.			",52,6,16,8,12,0,2

												I was questioning whether or not I should had spent $0.74 on this game, as it is very old and didn't look very deep in its gameplay. However, I decided to put my csgo skin money into this game, and was surprised. This game has solid driving controls and is not very hard to play. It is very much an arcade racer. It has much more content than I anticipated, containing 26 tracks and 49 cars to unlock. It features 5 game modes.-Quick Play: As you'd expect, just hop into a car, track, and racetype of your choice and have at it. Nothing more.-Ford Competition: The bread and butter of this game. Features many different cups in different areas of tracks and cars; whether its classic street racing or off road battling. Here you will unlock different cars and tracks to use in quick play and Ford Collection.-Ford Challenges: I have yet to touch this mode, but from what i understand it features challenges such as staying on racing lines. This mode will unlock vehicles such as the classic Thunderbirds.-Ford Collection: Where you can view all of your unlocked goodies and take them out for a spin.-Multiplayer: No one plays it, so it doesn't matter.Overall, this is a great classic game and a bargain at 74 cents. 8.5/10 Will probably 100%#Ford4Life			",89,9,5,9,4,1,1

												I could not recommend this game more.I have many 100s of hours game time on the original Xbox version of Ford Racing 3 and this is an excellent PC port, once you've configured a controller but I'll get back to that later, and one of only two games I've 100% completed, the other being Simpsons Hit and Run, 5 times.If you are reading this review then I assure you that you will be able to run this game completely lag and glitch free. NB: This is not an official guarantee, the developers/publishers of this game and the writer of this review are not liable for any losses of money or temper incurred through the purchase of this video game. (Although my computer is 8 years old and it runs seamlessly.)The graphics and controls are very smooth for a game originally released in 2005; I will say that the reduced number of polygons is evident and that the quality of this port is a fraction worse than the original. The physics are, unsurprisingly, not up to the standard of a modern day AAA title, but this can be used to your advantage. (Primarily the use of other racers rather than the brake pedal.)The best thing about Ford Racing 3 is its variety. •There are 5 game modes available: quick race (get racing only 3 clicks after launching the game), competition, challenge (exactly what it says on the tin), collection (allowing you to choose any car, track etc. you want) and multiplayer (which I am yet to see anyone else on).•There are 11 race types from the more common: standard race, elimination, boost, time attack, duel and racing line, to the more obscure (and often more challenging): driving skills, overtake, drafting, relay and seconds out (<--- can be incredibly frustrating)•There are 26 tracks that take you through a wide range of scenarios including: oval circuits, Hawaiian beaches, oil refineries, seaside towns, motorways and snow; all raceable in reverse.•There are 55 iconic Ford vehicles from the Model T to the Ford GT, but the 68’ Mustang is, in my opinion, the best in the game and it’s unlocked from the start which is a bonus.All of which you will have to unlock and master to 100% the game. The game has a good, if limited, soundtrack which suits the game well. Ford Racing 3 features a well developed levelling system that allows you to unlock: race types, tracks, vehicles and even liveries, by completely competitions and challanges. The game is also compatible with a controller which I highly recommend using, for any racing game. If you dont have controller then the game still plays well with the keyboard. If you do have a controller make sure you calibrate it correctly, this takes some trial and error but is worth the effort.For 79p in the Exploration Sale this game was a bargain, and maybe it's just nostalgia but I'd buy this game at full price in an instant. I guess there's only one way for you to find out.Finally I'd like to say a huge thank you for porting this game. My only criticism is that this has not been done with more titles. (Might I suggest 'Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge', I dropped mine down the back of a radiator years ago, I was on the last mission!!!!!)			",98,16,10,7,3,0,4

												You may look at the price of this game and think to yourself:""With that low-budget price tag it HAS to be absolut ♥♥♥♥♥, right?""You can take that opinion and ram it down a trashcan, because for 4,99€ you get alot of stuff that modern day racing games wouldn't think about putting in their game!Controls work great, only tried with keyboard yet though.Every single car handles differently....every...single...ONE, wich is the way it should be.I highly recomend this game to anyone that likes to play games....yeah, it's that much fun.There are alot of fun to be had in Ford Racing 3, and you are missing out by continuing to read this ;-)//Mr.Muppio

												First off, my gameplay time is irrevelant hence the fact it runs best for me through the executable in the root directory bypassing steam.With a price tag less than a coffee, i wasn't expecting much. The reviews were positive prior to my purchase, however, I attributed that to nostalgia.  But this game pleasantly surprised me in all aspects. The controls are tight, yet floaty. The car and track selection are superb, and the progression feels perfect.  For one such as I, i greatly appreciate  how forgiving it is. With very little penatly for collisions and mistakes, it allows you to enjoy the game whatever your skill level (up to the point where i am writing this review at least) It is very beautiful for a game from 2004, and is available natively in 1080p which was awesome. And it has the Galaxie 500!!!			",202,3,6,10,7,1,9

												Ford Racing 3 is one of those games that i can recommend because you can get it for cheap on sale (0.49 cents) and because of nostalgia. Otherwise, don't bother. The game isn't terrible, but isn't good either. But at least the developers know it. The main objective of this game is to win a series of tournaments and challenges to unlock more content. That's it. There's at least a good amount of vehicles to unlock and i enjoyed some of the tracks (but some off-road ones are terrible). The physics are acceptable, the graphics dated (but not bad for it's age) and the music gets the job done. The controller support is also poor. But it's worth it's price on sale, and your time if you want some nostalgia.			",267,164,6,30,13,4,38

												TL;DR: Is fun. looks ok, Supports 1080p with stretched visuals. Supports 360 contoller. Meh sound, good for 99p.I had Ford Racing 2 around the time it came out, and remembered it being quite fun at the time. I thought I'd buy this to pass the time whilst Theif downloads. At 280mb, FR3 only took a few minutes. This is basically an arcade racer before Arcade Racers became showy, boombastic, DUB filled, EA-Sign-In-Please Racers, and it is all the better for it. Essentially you just race races to unlock cars, and do special challenge races to unlock other cars.At its core, the racing physics are pretty good for an Arcade Racer; there is a good balance between grip and powersliding fun, and the cars go far faster than in real life, All in all the driving works well and is the reason why it kept me entertained as well as it did. It supports the 360 controller in that you can bind the triggers to acellerate and brake.The graphics are probably equivalent to late Xbox, early 360 graphics, and almost look cartoony. At the end of the day they get the job done well enough, and support all resolutions that Windows allows, but only supports 4:3 so at 16:9 the game looks stretched. Have a look at http://forums.overclockers.co.uk/showpost.php?p=27281114&postcount=1243 for some better screenshots than the steam page.The sound is passable.Overal, I was going to spend the 99p on a coffee at work on Monday, so, did I get more enjoyment than I would from a coffee? Yes, absolutely. ",142,20,12,14,17,0,27

Its a fun game if you are looking for a break of all those simulations out there like Assetto Corsa or Project Cars. This is definately a good game to pick up. You get classic, modern and vintage pickups and cars. As you see by the giant thumbs up, this is definately a game to buy IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT. I feel like 5 dollars is over priced for this game.

												FR3 is an arcade racing game with some famous Ford vehicles on variety of closed tracks, with variations and time of day to make the tracks look more varied than reality. There are the typical racing modes, regular race, elimination, but a few special modes like boost where you have to time the use of nitro boost carefully to pass. The graphics are pretty low but then, this game is old, and the frame rate is good. The cars do skid somewhat but in a rather arcadish manner, with no tuning possible. There are two sets of missions. First is the Ford Cups. You start with fairly classic cars, classic Mustang, Mustang II, 46 Ford, Ford Galaxie, etc. As you win the cup, you unlock additional cars, additional cups, and additional liveries for the cars. The idea is to win all events and be declared the ultimate Ford Racing Champion. Obviously the later events gets really tricky, as cars get faster and harder to control. And there are many classes of vehicles, from offroaders to trucks, from coupes to moderns, from sedans to super-sport (like the GT and Mustang GT). Once you collected enough vehicles, you can do the vehicle specific challenges, which are even harder. The race types are somewhat inventive, as they go beyond the typical race. Regular Race: race 3 laps and who's the winner at the end?Elimination: race 3 laps, last two places eliminated per lap until last lap as it's down to sudden deathDuel: race ONE other car on first lap, 2 on second lap, and 3 on third lap. Beat them all. Driving skill: race through the gates (don't hit them) to buy more time and finish the lap before time runs outOvertake: overtake X cars before your time runs out (overtake adds time on the clock, hitting them takes time off the clock)Racing line: stay on the racing line to earn boost for overtakeBoost: two boosts for each lap, use them wiselyDrafting: stay behind the other vehicle for X seconds to eliminate them, eliminate the goal amount and you winRelay: Race one lap, draft your buddy to ""pass"", then you race that car for another lap... repeat for third lap. Seconds out: hit the required number of symbols AND finish within time limit to win. Symbols may give or take away time depending on whether you hit green or red symbols. Time Attack: finish lap within time limits. You have 3 attempts. The handling model is definitely arcadish, but not ""on rails"" as you'd expect. You do slide around corners, and skidding is measured (or drifting). Burnout is also measured. Sliding along walls is not recommended, but handbrake slides are possible for tight corners. And obviously all the vehicles will handle somewhat differently (but not THAT differently... Would you believe a .46 Ford can keep up with a '63 Mustang? )  AI cheats somewhat, but not excessively. It will punish you for your mistakes though.  And as races get longer, you will make mistakes. And on harder levels, the times get shorter, the first car gets a boosted takeoff, and so on.  The game starts to get frustrating about mid-point, when you realize the AI cheats to stay close to you unless you build up a large lead through truly flawless driving, and that's just on the easy races. And this is obviously not always possible. By the end, when you hit the ""hard"" races, is when you realize that the AI makes impossible turns and you'll NEVER catch up. There is no cockpit view, only bumper, third-person close, and third-person far. I recommend third-person far as you need to see the road ahead . The races do get a bit dreary as each cup is composed of multiple events and it's just using different cars. As you unlock more cars, you can try different cars but again, same courses over and over, so many laps, it gets repetitive, even with all the alternate racing modes. And when you get to the hard races, where AI makes impossible speeds with you having no chance to catch up, is when you feel like throwing out this game. Given its low price point, give it a try, but it's not a deep game, and you should only play it in short stretches unless you get horribly bored. This is basically a 1998 game (similar to NFS High Stakes, with a few extra modes)  The multiplayer ability along with ""design your own race"" (which is really ""remix our races, tracks, and vehicles"") adds some replayability, and it is possible to play this game at high res, but this is an old game, and it's severely out of date. Go play NFS: Most Wanted (the original) for a lot more thrills, IMHO.			",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

												I absolutely love this game. I used to play Ford Racing 2 all the time on the PS2. I am more into computer gaming now, but i was looking up a racing game and had happened to stumble upon this one. While I was thinking of it, it brought back so many memories. It was only $.99, which is a great deal, but had mixed reviews. I still knew i had to get it anyway. REMEMBER: This game is from 2005, so its graphics are not the best. But the gameplay and style of it are very fun. Only one thing to keep in mind: You CANNOT change the resolution of this game. But those downsides are definitely not enough to ruin my love for this game.			",88,7,12,4,32,7,1

												What can I say, if you like old school games then you may like this, a great classic with no compatability problems (for me on Win10) the graphics kind of give me a headache but it's great if you have a low-end PC and just want something to play, it has a pretty low resolution that won't look good on large monitors that cannot be changed.

												Pure freaking classic.This game has almost twelve years and still doesn't fail to bring unrestrained joy of play. Okay, the physics are a strange combination of arcade high-speed turns and little to no braking and sim generally tough-to-make turns, but it's rewarding in its own way when you perfect every single one of that many cars. The models aren't perfect and as highly-detailed as modern racing fans would expect them to be, but they still are impressively similar to the original things - as the game title suggests, Ford fans won't be disappointed. The variety of cars is a strong pro of the game - ranging from 1923 Ford Model T seen so rarely in games to concept models like Indigo - once you dive into the world of the game, you won't feel the urge to leave it too quickly. The sentimental value is superior - FR3 hasn't aged at all. It was fun, is fun, and will be fun, and that's all that matters here. It's not a game that pretends to be the best racer in history. All it aspires to do is to bring joy to players.Also, it costs freaking HALF AN EURO on sale. You WON'T get ANYTHING better in that price. I bought it for the sheer power of childhood memories I have with FR series (FR2 in particular) and I don't and won't regret it.			",116,20,12,9,7,0,18

												Totally generic, dull race game. It's perfectly playable - bug free and smooth - but it's mind numbingly dull. The engine noises are pretty dire and the music is so bad it really needs to be disabled completely. Despite many competition 'rounds' there are only a handful of tracks that are just re-used by racing them backwards or with a slightly different route. The night tracks are strange because none of the cars appear to have headlights - consequently it's just dark and feels wrong. 'Bare bones' and 'generic' are how I would describe the experience. Not recommended unless you've played every other race game on steam and curiosity gets the better of you.			",8,0,0,1,0,0,0

												What is the most cancerous game YOU have ever played?! Definetely not this game! Made in 2004 with graphics straight outta 1896, with a total budget of $0.82 made by Bob Loblaw (You know the guy who made Bad Rats, Takedown: Red Sabre, and the holocaust) made this in his mothers dirty, smelly, disgusting basement.Obviously sponsered by Chevrolet, this game has year 2020 physics in it. The sound in this beautiful game is devine. Although, this game has a lot of Dodge cars, I feel like more Fords should have been used in this game. This game is SO GOOD IN FACT, that i want to drink bleach with rat poison and windex mixed into the bleach and drink it like water on a hot, steamy, summer day.next game on my list is Schlinder's List!

												This game is just horrible.I'd bought it because it was on sale, with hopes it'd be as great as the first Ford Racing, but once I got to playing this heap of garbage, I was utterly disappointed. I can say I shouldn't have been surprised though by this game's low sale price, but still, I'd expect a higher quality standard from a game released in 2004.The graphics are garbage; the windows are opaque, the reflections non-existant, the detail low with no option to increase graphic quality. The gameplay is awful; the car slips and slides everywhere, there is zero penalty for hitting a wall, and the computer controlled opponents can be spun out by tapping them. The career mode is boring versus where you actually got to do a championship with each car in FR1 to unlock its' black version with enhanced peformance.To sum it up, don't buy this. Either buy a racing game that's worth your time or try the first game.			",47,7,5,3,2,1,3

												On the pro side:The game has voiceover - even in the menus. And there seem to be a wide variety of cars (that you have to unlock). Also you're able to remap the controls except that some keys are offlimit.On the con side:You can't change the screen resolution and despite the 2005 date, the game looks more akin to need for speed 2 from the 90s.The sound quality is really poorAnd there aren't even any sound effects for the surface you drive on - alphalt, dirt or grass - no sound. Not even when you collide with an indestructible hedge. At least it doesn't slow you down when you hit something I suppose. Controls by the way are not very believable. Way too much grip for old muscles - as if esp is turned on at all time, in the 60s.Did I mention the menus? Voice acted, but ripped directly from console. You can't even use the keyboard to type your driver name or use the mouse.And you need hit enter some 10 times after you finished a race before you're back to playingOverall the game isn't worth the 1,24€ asking price. I don't think it was when it was new either.			",1280,529,93,186,187,22,306

												NO I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME!!!! AQUIRE HOLY WATER BEFORE PLAYING! This game absolutly sucks in resolution and in playing. Even if you are a ford fan like me this game is not what it was on console for ps2. This should be free to play because the graphics suck and the fact that it is an arcade game that requires nothing to run. If you hacked this you could run this on IOS or android at the same settings.			",45,1,8,3,4,0,4

												The only good thing about the three Ford Racing games is the music; some heavy  metal music really adds to the atmosphere, but the actual racing experience is way too dated.  With poor drift abilities, poor vehicle damage, poor vehicle handling.  their is  additional content such as the ability to upgrade your  cars components , which you hgave to earn by winning races.  The  AI  is pretty dumb and, oh yeah,   the graphics  will tell you this game  was released 10 years ago.   This game is amongst  the worst driving/racing game  I've played in a long time.  If you are determined to buy it, I'd advise you to wait till the   sales.  I'm sure all three will  be  on  sale soon?  In the Steam sales you can get far superior  Need for Speed titles for the same price you're paying for these games, and Crash Time 2 and 3, which are  on sale frequently   are even less  and are  beautiful games compared to this monstosity.  FlatOut 2 is only  25% more and has so much more going for it, with gorgoeous graphics, fully destructible environments and cars, upgradable  vehicles and  some interesting modes included. One other positive (apart from the music), especially if you are into  retro cars; you can race the very first  Ford car  (Ford Model T)I really don't know why Valve are adding such mediocre games to their library.

												This is a nice racing game from the Ps2. It has a nice variety of tracks, cars, and challenges to do. This game has controller support and I always use my controller and I recommend you use it too, it makes playing the game a lot easier at some parts and a lot harder at others. You basically have to unlock everything in the single player so that adds to the ammount of time you can play this game without getting bored. This game was initially released in March of 2004 so don't expect Forza 5 graphics. Overall this game is an 8/10.			",142,37,16,14,8,3,11

												Man do i miss this game! this game is very fun for you guys that like racing games, it has a lot of car selections and all of them are fords! i'm a ford fan on my own and this game has a lot of fords that was rarely shown like the ford indigo, the ford mustang mach 3 concept, the ford GT70 concept, the Ford GT90 concept (wich is my favorite) , and many more! if you want to know what is this game like, well......... think of Gran Turismo 4 with a huge selctions of cars and all of them are fords, and the graphics are slightly decreased. and suprisingly this game has more reality on the driving/ car control       ( yep you need brakes in this game) and one thing that gran turismo 4 doesn't have is car suspension simulation ( wich is already available on gran turismo 5 and 6) if you open your PS2 again or you tube as you can see that the car suspension is very stiff in all of the cars but in this game the car suspensions are perfect! the cons are:Steam should have updated the game so we can use newer fords like ford fiesta 2013, ford raptor, ford GT 2006, and moreThe gameplay is too easy (for me)no car damage ( visual or entirely)arcade car contact but i fully recommended this game to be played 7/10it brings back many memories too.......

												It's actually not a half bad racer, The handling isn't quite as crisp as modern games and the graphics are obviously not as good as a modern game but yeah I like it. It's a good little arcade racer definetly get it on offer though. I wouldn't pay over a dollar or two!

												Although I played it little it was enjoyable while it lasted. I only had one crash but that is exceptional considering it is a game from 2005 being played on my Windows 8 laptop. Controls are a bit confusing but that may just be because I play very very little racing games. Almost worth the $4.99 price tag but I would wait until it is on sale to buy it. I managed to catch it on sale for $0.49 around Halloween so there's an example for you. 5/10 would Ford Race again.			",164,33,6,19,4,2,11

They jump from side to side, bump around like rubber cars, drift as much as if road was ice.And from some odd reasons, AI doesn't have those problems, they perform Vturns without even releasing the gas pedal (jaw-dropping sight).

												A fun, straight to the point racing game! Graphics are nice and tracks are interesting and diverse. Cons: The physics are kinda broken sometimes and there is no sound when bumping other cars.

												I'm going to keep this short and sweet. This is basically a first impressions review.The graphics are okay, keep in mind this game is from 2005. The physics are also pretty decent, comparable to modern arcade racers if I'm honest. The sound is... Meh, it's not going to be the best with the game being from 2005 and all but it's not bad either and I think it's pretty obvious that this game isn't very demanding.It's probably not something you'll spend long sessions with though. Again, first impressions here but it does feel like it'll be a game that you play, complete and then don't touch for a while. That being said it looks like it has quite a lot of levels so it could last you a bit.The bad points:Steam lanches the game.exe rather than the launcher- Launching it with steam will run it in a low resolution (like 800x600 or something like that). You'll want to go into the config file and run a .exe and click run game on that launcher. I'd recommend making one of those config exe files the shortcut for this game as steam seems to launch it in the lower resolution even if you changed it in the actual game launcher.Limited graphical settings. It's  just a matter of low, medium or high in the game launcher (which steam DOESN'T launch)The AI seems easy and there seems to be a sort of invisible wall traveling ahead of you so the AI can't get too far ahead of you. The AI also seems to keep up with your pace but they don't attempt to pass you unless you actually try to do something to let them pass.Overall: A pretty decent game from what I've played so far. It has it's flaws (one of which is down to steam) and it's age shows but if you're looking for an old, arcade racer to kill some time then this would be a good pick. ",337,58,50,40,46,2,44

												This game is really old, and consequences are noticable from the first minute you start the game. Graphics are like PS2 game(because it is a PS2 game :D), fixed on 640x480, and also there is some kind of input lag that is meant to be smoothing of steering to prevent car flying around on little keyboard presses. The whole game is PS2 game with keyboard controls strapped onto it. Mouse does nothing.Allright, enough of bad things. In everything else, this is great racing game. Physics work really fine, and even bots are sometimes likely to try to push you off the road. 8 rogue mustangs out of 10.			",107,18,4,3,8,1,8

												I used to play this game when I was a kid and it's exactly how I remember it. It's a fairly fun little game and it doesn't cost much only about 5 bucks unless it's on sale for less. Though do keep in mind you aren't buying some ultrarealistic racing simulator but it's still a hell of a lot of fun and some of these challenges can actually be a little difficult (or I just suck). The only real complaint I have is that some times after races the game will stop working and close which can be kind of frustrating. Still, its a fun game and I would definitely recommend getting it especially when it's on sale.			",103,10,8,14,9,1,3

												When I was 5, I played this game. I had no idea what I was doing. I would come last place, and it was OK, because I had no idea what that meant.Fast forward to when this review was written, I found the game to be quite interesting. I never noticed that this game ran in 60 FPS, especially since it was a PS2 game. I never knew this game's graphics were going to age this well. I didn't even know all the cars, I was just fascinated with any car that was a sports car.Now, this is a personal pet peeve of mine, but I highly dislike the soundtrack. By saying this, I would be nitpicking, but it's something you don't really expect on this game.However, this game is definitely worth buying if it's on discount. A true classic and suprisingly held up to today's standards, though more dated than modern. A must-buy if the discount brings it below 50%.Graphics: 8 [Dated]Gameplay: 8Audio: 6Overall: 7.5 [Must Buy if Discounted]			",31,3,3,1,1,0,3

												If you're willing to use buttons for the brake/throttle and accept the dated graphics and 480p fixed resolution, and love cars, it's a fun game. There are many different cars you can drive.			",22,3,18,1,15,0,2
