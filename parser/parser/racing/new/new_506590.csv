												Thought the game was suspiciously shallow, then realized it was due to being nothing more than an asset flip.  Should not be for sale.			",466,194,15,21,27,5,35

												I just wish people wouldn't do this asset flip stuff. Rest in peace originality.There's actually potential for a decent game here, if the gamemodes were a bit more varied rather than all the same thing, and the assets didn't cost $29.50 it could actually be a calming, fun flight sim. But alas, every gamemode is the same and the game was designed by somebody else...			",91,15,0,4,5,0,2

												Yes this game is an asset flip, so what should I do to play? Pay $29.50 on https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/55700 or pay $1,79 for this? Tell me where is the problem?The principle you're right, that's why I would like to make refund but not only; the game is incomplete that was a reason of the cheap price, have a more potential to be the best fly simulator, but without a multiplayer, statistics, story line, more music, more achievements, more mission and other, it's just a copy of incomplete idea from the original developer (It's not stolen and reverted). So if you are confused as me meanwhile stay away and wait for news updating, but If you want to play a casual race fly game with gorgeous world that make you in a trip, take it!

												So much potential for a calming exploring trip being wasted because of some simple stuff...I'm not even sure if it's even worth addressing the pros/cons....Pros:- Good music- Nice colours (exactly as you see on the screenshots)- Many planes to choose- Nicely Optimized?Cons: (Here we go)- The plane movement is 50% cancer, 49% chlamydia- Fixed(Unchangeable) move keys- A few bugs not allowing you to continue playing- Camera is complete AIDS. Destroys the whole experience and gets irritating when trying to make a flip because you lose control of where the plane goes(It would be waaaayyyy better if it was locked on plane's movement)- Collecting gas as fast as possible becomes the only purpose- There are stuff like introduction maps that are just other maps with more cancer and nothing to tell you the objective(not that it's hard to figure it out)- Only 25k meters through cancer-land to unlock the second ship(if i remember correctly)I really tried to like this game but i just can't. It would be sooooooooooooo much more playable if the moving keys weren't unchangeable and the camera was locked! If the devs aren't ever willing to do that then you should buy this cancer for only 1.99 now!			",100,30,4,6,11,5,9

												WAY too simplistic for my taste. Sorta reminds me of The Polynomialthe music sucks and is on a endless loopthe menus are ♥♥♥♥ed up, scrolling is sooo slow and the entire interface is weirdBest thing is the graphicsThe price is very low, and it should be. But even then i say skip this, there are far better arcade games out there			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You basically fly a plane, searching for orbs that replenish your fuel.The very few orbs that you can find on the map are so well hidden and far away from each other that, even if you are able to spot one of them, you will most likely use all of your fuel trying to get there.The music can be pretty boring after a short while, along with the game modes which HAD to include the search for those orbs.The only thing that's actually pretty good is the color choice.Not recommended.TLDR; Nice colors, awful game. Definitely not worth any amount of money.			",81,15,2,11,7,0,4

												I only ended up with this game because it was apparently part of a bundle that included other games I actually wanted.  I have no interest in supporting asset flippers and people who take the work of others and pose it as their own, particularly those trying to gain profit from it.I don't even like that I had to run the game for at least 5 minutes before it would allow me to post a review.Steam needs better curation than just random people voting on Greenlight.

												Boy, do I feel duped into buying this game. From what I gathered from the trailer, I thought this was to be a simple and relaxing game with calming visuals and a cheery soundtrack. I assumed the game had a variety of game modes. Whilst the visuals and soundtrack delivers, the gameplay overall feels shallow. There is only one game mode (how far can you get your plane to go before crashing or running out of fuel) and that has brought me no relaxation. I should've known better, realized that this was asset flipped, and not wasted my money on this game.			",6,4,1,0,3,0,0

												This game has the potential to be a good game , but it has few key features that are missing and are holding it back from being the game you would want to play.lets start with the pros: 1. the art in the game is unique and very nice to look at 2. the controlls are fairly easy and make sense (i play on the keyboard)3. one piece of music in the game is enjoyable (for the first couple of minutes)cons : 1. as it is now the game is VERY repetitive : you would change game modes and levels and it is always the same 2. the only piece of music in the game repeats it self in a loop and becomes very annoying and monotonic.3. there is one and only objective in the game and it is to capture orbs in order to maintain your fuel level (it gets boring after couple of minutes)4. does not have gamepad compatibility (xbox 360 controller)With all that said i feel that this game has potential to be a good game because it has the unique are style and it is easy to playWhat i would want to see from this game in the future:1. more levels and would expect someting new for each level (so it would be interesting to play).2. more pieces of music to make game experience more compeling.3. more game mode with different objectives.4. gamepad compatibility in conclusion :I give this game the thumbs up for the art but i would say wait with this game and buy it when it has more features .

												For $1.79 it is a very enjoyable game and is VERY aesthetically pleasing. It is an ""endless runner"" but the maps are not procedurally generated as far as I know so you can learn routes to make it further each time. The controls are inverted since you are playing as a plane which can be both annoying and difficult but it doesn't make the game less enjoyable if that is an issue.  I have a video with gameplay of ""Sky Valley"" if you want to see what it's like before buying it.

			Sky valley is an ""endless runner"" type game with absolutely stunning visuals. The game is run on Unity engine and is a great time killer and is fairly priced.		

All in all I do like this game but for $1.79 you are getting $1.79 worth of content and there isn't much but it has plane unlockables and different maps and game modes so if you are looking for a cheap time killer this is a great game.			",300,53,5,40,52,3,25

												I would like to play this with my extreme 3d pro joystick, but the controls for roll is not advanced enough to alow me to change them to the horizontal axis (axis 0) but instead wants my usual yaw control as my roll control and vise versa. Othervise a good casual game with funky tunes. Just what it says on the tin.			",74,3,4,3,11,0,7

												EDIT: Apparently, it's a premade asset, with a few additions from the developer. You're getting a premade asset with some mods, for 90% off the original price. At face value though? I can still say it's an okay game.Does exactly what it describes. Fun, simple time waster that looks nice and of course runs well. Controls are easy to pick up and the levels can at times be difficult, but not frustratingly so. I'd recommend it for $2.Also trading cards :^)			",187,39,2,18,20,0,18
