												For those that already own the full MXGP game. This is only a ""compact"" version of the full game. There is no career mode, no 250f, no custom riders, and all of the bugs present in the full game are in this one, as well.			",73,0,7,2,8,0,5

												For the price you get all the aspects of the full game without the custom riders. you still get all the tracks and pro riders its well put together, but on the hardest difficulty after a few hours is still not that hard which for me is a bad thing nut still really fun to get a good flow and throw some sick scubbies			",79,7,6,2,7,1,7

												I bought this game on the premis that people were actually playing it, Then I bought it and went online to see that there were 0 servers and 0 players online. I just spent $10 on a game with 3 modes that do the same thing and no multiplayer...Dont do what I did... Unless you want to play online with me, then im down.			",63,5,6,5,4,0,2

												MXGP Compact ist, ähnlich wie MotoGP Compact, eine rein abgespeckte Version von MXGP. Dabei muss ich aber betonen, dass diese Compactversion von der Technik und vom Gameplay her deutlich über der von MotoGP liegt. Hier kann der Preis von 10€ eher noch hingenommen werden. Dennoch würde ich jedem empfehlen, frisch den vollen Titel zu holen. Sollte dieser euch nämlich nicht gefallen, dann könnt ihr immer einen Refund anfordern. Seit es Steamrefund gibt, sind diese Compact-Titel teilweise sinnlos geworden, aber wer nur mehr wenige Rubel in den Taschen hat und ein Cross-Spiel für zwischendurch benötigt, kann es gerne im Sale ergattern.

												The compact version of mxgp is great in the sense that you get all the tracks and all the pro riders, however custom riders are missing but , however the game as a whole is good but the lack of in air bike control, pre determined scrubs and stiff riding lets the game down. But the bike physx on the ground with the leaning function make riding more realistic then say reflex. The jumps are two small or the bikes are too fast i cant decide which but scaling is a problem as i find myself over jumping everything and nose diving into the ground. The next game needs a serious overhall in the controls department but graphicall its solid with bike models being rendered very well.Overall the game is worth getting especially on sale , but be warned the multiplayer is a little broken .6.5/10			",32,1,2,0,1,0,7

												Check the demo, shows more than any reviews!After Reflex this one has so much better physics, really love it. Not an absolute sim but controlling the racer needs attention, turning, leaning, breaking really have an influence on how you progress. I like how you can slide into corners and how your bike's tires get the grip when you accelerate in the right moment. No doubt this is one of Milestone's better products!Just finished a championship on medium difficulity; one 3-lap race on each track. Took 1hrs and 48 minutes. I guess my next championship will be 2-race, 4-5 laps each, hard difficulity. Than that's it for me - a good but simple game, great deal for the money. To be honest I was not interested on the other version's career mode, I just wanted some quick races, that's all. I you are really into motocross, get that one. (same title, without 'compact' in it)			",177,12,39,6,16,0,21

												Due to the mixed review of the compact version of MXGP, I was sure if I'd enjoy it as much as the full version, but you get your moneys worth! It's only $10 for the compact game, not a terrible price it could be worse folks. People said bugs were present in this version but were patched in the full version of MXGP but personally I had no problems with the game. The compact version doesn't offer a custom rider ability :( which that does kind of suck but sheesh it doesn't take away too much from gameplay and what not. And sadly the biggest con of this version is no career mode (getting factory offers for race team, etc) but for $10 you can't expect TOO much from it. For someone who wants to try it out or someone who doesn't like motocross too much I recommend this version but for anyone else I recommend the full version but all in all the compact game is still really fun and personally I enjoy this one and think its a good buy.

												This game is what it is, and a lot of fun. It's a compact version of the game and looks great. Don't let the ""madbrah"" reviews   keep you from having fun with this game. Not only am I enjoying it, i'm recommending it to my friends and may in fact buy it for them. There was a download issue the ""first"" night, but they fixed it in a matter of hours. They were on top of the issue, and it works wonderfully. Again, great game for $10. No, it's not the full game, that's why is says COMPACT...come on guys. Give this a fair shake and leave your butt hurt at the door.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
