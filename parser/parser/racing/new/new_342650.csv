Fermi's twisty turny path...Fermi's path is another in the ever expanding genre of ""reaction test"" games. I like to call them youtube fodder, they're great when you scale up the difficulty and are able to produce reality bending feats of skill for the video replays, but in general they play to a pretty limited audience. The question is - is this one going to be specifically any better than say Super Hexagon (one of the biggest names in this area) or the more brutal Velocibox?The problem of good graphics.The game -looks- pretty, with graphics running at a smooth clip, with a smooth palette of colours and vivid backgrounds, there's an almost ephemeral quality to proceedings as you glide along the ""rail"" towards your goal, avoiding various obstacles, both static and mobile, and you've the ability to rotate in ninety degree increments along the rail, as well as jump and shoot certain types of obstacle to remove them. Herein lies both the biggest twist in Fermi's path, and the major step towards originality in this area, and the problems which in turn, prevent it from escaping the shadow of games like Velocibox and Super Hexagon.When you twist and turn, oh the colours, they pretty... don't look at the light! (I can't help it, it's so beaaautiful...)The problem with Fermi's Path, and note, it's something that is subjective, but it's the kind of problem that will be a problem, for anyone who intends to play at speed, is that due to the nature of the game (rotating around a central rail) and the graphical nature of the game, with lots of different colours and effects going on, considering this is intended as a reaction game, there's too much visual information, and at times the rail will obscure the obstacles and route coming up by virtue of the fact the route will be on the *opposite side of the rail* or off by ninety degrees. At low speeds this is quite easy to cope with, but as the game ramps up into twitch territory, this quickly dips into unforgivable sin territory.Playing a twitch game where you do not have perfect information about what's coming up in the not too dim and distant is the cardinal sin of the twitch game world. In ""The path mode"" you have the ability to memorise the route by rote, but in randomly generated levels, no such luck.Good looking, but ultimately lacking...As a diversion from the more hardcore twitch games, it certainly fills a hole. It has great graphics, and as a way to unwind from the tougher games or even as a way to ""warm up"" before a session of Velocibox, I could definitely see it serving a role. However, as a twitch game in it's own right, there's several issues that simply mean that compared to the likes of Super Hexagon and Velocibox, well, there's simply better options on the table. This is good, but there is better.Verdict : Wishlist it, worth considering if you're a big fan of twitch games and need a more sedate option to unwind with ",1647,571,92,264,280,18,320

												this game is.... not that great.it's not terrible, but it's far from good as well.------------------------------------first of, let's talk about the positive stuffyou're a ball that follows a straight path, and you go to the end while avoiding various ennemiesthe end.the concept is simple and effective!it's challenging and completing the levels feels like an accomplishement, which is great!now you might be wondering:""but then, why are you saying it's only okay?""well here's why.while the concept is simple and the game is challenging, it feels incredibely repetitive, all the levels look the same because of how simple it is, and I usualy get bored of it pretty quickly because of that.then, there's the fact that the ""ball"" you control blocks your view when it's in the air, and this can be pretty annoying at timesoh yeah,  and the ennemies can shoot at you, and you know, that doesn't sound that bad, and it's not, because you can shoot as well.the problem is that it's really hard to actualy see the bullets,there's also the music, which, in most of the levels I've played so far, doesn't sound like anything when you get a high combo. (because FYI, the music gets more layers as your combo gets higher)the game also as power ups, which is good, except that they're never explained to you, so you're just picking them up hoping the game will show you what it does at some point.finaly, the game as a level editor, and it could've been made so much easier than it currently is, it just looks so daunting and difficult to use right now.there's also the fact that you can only use the musics in the game (and they can't change that because they would have to drop the workshop integration due to the copyright issues that could come out of this), but as I've said, they're just a bunch of mess after a while.so all in all, if you've been eyeballing this game for a while and every gameplay videos you've seen from this game look awesome, buy it, but wait until it's on sale, because I don't think this is worth more than 5 bucks as it currently stands.if you didn't know about this game before, I'd say pass, there are better games like this one out there.Final Rating: 5/10			",318,126,5,18,46,4,35

												Fermis' Path is small little fun arcadey racer game set in the world of the subatomic particles.

Up until to a point that is...The gameplay at first is very enjoyable and relaxing as you blast through beautiful sub atomic environments while collecting smaller particles then you and avoiding other particles that may cause a violent reaction.You're movement is restricted to jumping and side stepping to the other sides of the quantum string(?) in which you are bound to along with the other particles.Most of the particles are merely there as an obstacle rather then being violent towards you and so you can just jump or side step from harm's way.Some of them though seem to find pleasure in taking a more radical approach to end you and either come speeding towards you or shoot at you with neutrons or whatever.Fortunately though you have this ability as well and you may dispatch these particles while dodging the attacks they shoot.The visuals and the music really help to set the mood for the game.In the background there is a lot of weird quantum things floating around giving an eerie yet relaxing feeling.The music also helps as it mildly futuristic in tone, even though I can't really nail down the genre for it, but I still find it to be fitting for the game.Though the relaxing feeling for the game does change into frustration when you reach the tenth level or so.Because at this point the games difficulty, just spikes up and doesn't seem to come down.So do bear that in mind.So if you were put of by the relaxing tones and thinking that this is just a filthy casual game, then fret not because there is a lot of challenge and replayability in the game as you try to perfect you're score and finding the secrets in the levels themselves.  There is also an level editor which I didn't really took a look at, but if you like making you're own levels then that's a nice bonus.Do take look of some gameplay if you are interested in the video up above and below.

												Runners usually please me, especially the science-themed ones like 'Boson X' or 'The Collider', but I don't recommend this game for it is unfairly hard and generally dull, plus it has blurry textures and lags on weaker machines. It's very difficult to assess right distances for your movement on that monotonous pathway you travel, there are no landmarks to judge it. Sometimes when the path bends you can't even see the upcoming obstacles, so you'll have to memorize the pre-made levels by heart. I shall hunt for achievements a bit, but I curse the devs already, Im so bored..Бегунки обычно доставляют мне удовольствие, особенно научно-тематические типа ""Бозона Хэ"" и ""Сталкивателя"", но эту игру я не рекомендую, так как она несправедливо тяжела и в общем скучна, а также имеет мыльные текстуры и тормозит на слабых машинах. Очень трудно оценивать расстояния на равномерной дорожке, по которой мы путешествуем, нет никаких отметок, чтобы по ним рассчитать. Иногда при повороте дорожки просто не видно набегающих препятствий, поэтому придется учить наизусть все заготовленные уровни. Я поборюсь за достижения немного, но уже проклинаю разрабов, как же мне скучно...			",1420,573,53,157,157,19,229

												Good game to load up for a casual play. It hits the spot if you don't have the time for a full-on game in your library.The mechanic is fun. Graphics are good (although higher res would've made the experience perfect).I got it in a sale btw.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A small past time game . not bad to get if cheap . but one thing is annoying . we r travelling on a pipe and to see the other side to get the idea that we have any ooportunity or path there is not very good . we have to actually turn to see what is there .. and that is risky when we r at the end and we have to fail just because we can not see what path we should take ! anyway it is just u have to guide ur ball to finish .. i will give it recomended but get it on sale ..
