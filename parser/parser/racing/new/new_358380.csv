												What we got here is a mario kart clone with good variety though the racing itself feels a bit generic and without as much depth as the original due to the lack of drifting mechanics from what I can tell (the game has a handbrake button that does a 90 degree left turn for you by itself or a right 90 one turn if you got right pressed down as you use it) and the power ups are standard fare but overall it's still playable and it has local co-op if you and another friend want to have some nostalgia tinged fun racing around the flat but varied tracks.You can race as a Pelican... that's an underrepresented critter in gaming I find.

												My story is probably the same as most of you who happened to have come across this game + pack. I used to play this game on split screen mode with my two cousins from way down south when we were there on family visits and have many fond memories from playing this along with clasics such as jazz jackrabbit micro machines and you name it.Let it be clear that this game is not some remake or updated version it's the original that is emulated on dosbox so no flashy updates or enhanced mouse support this game will continue exactly where you left it all those years ago. Me and a buddy who also played this game back in the days did a few cups against each other on split screen mode and in between the insanity during the race i managed to make a few pics.Here's us at the start/finish line. I play as the panda (low) and he as the shark (top):

A handy thing to keep in mind with old games is that this game will not be full screen depending on which screen size you use. aged 2D games such as wacky wheels and many others from the DOS era were never meant to be stretched out as much on the modern screen sizes you see with computers today and while there are some ways to tamper with these sizes the black edges will always be a little visible and might not make the image any better the bigger it gets. In the worst case scenario  you could always score an old computer screen from somewhere and knock yourself out.All in all i'm very satisfied with this game and the good state it still remains in after all this time and i definitely recommend getting it for those who are in a nostalgic mood. I hope to have helped you guys out there a bit with my review but if there's anything you need to know about this game feel free to ask it's what i'm here for.All the best!(s.i.e)			",173,41,1,15,22,2,18

												Its time to put on your 90s nostalgia goggles and travel back to a time when the kart racing genre was fresh and new. Wacky Wheels is a kart racer with eight anthropomorphic characters, and its one expansion pack which makes for six championship cups, thirty circuits across twenty-five tracks and a dozen more miscellaneous tracks.To this version's credit, its a 90s DOS game that's playable on Steam out-of-the box when other games fail to run even when they include DOSBox. The game scores big points for having native 360 controller support as well. Beyond working as it should, that's where the compliments end and the reality of a twenty year-old game sets in.I assume this is a kids game with how generic it is and the eight animal drivers. You have a pelican, tiger, raccoon, elephant, moose, camel, panda and the coolest of them all, a shark. The game never does much with its animal theme. The drivers make appropriate sounds several times and have honking horns each time they're near. Without stats to tell me there's a difference in driver abilities, they all feel the same. The elephant feels just as speedy as the raccoon. Perhaps the differences are too subtle to notice.There's a lot of mediocre content in the Wacky Wheels, you have single and two player split screen championships with five races each, a two player shoot out, a single player wacky duck shoot out and comm-bat play over a modem or serial cable. The menu seems to trigger when there's a button held rather than a button pressed. So I can hold the button and watch as it skips through the menu. At the bottom of the main menu is ordering information to purchase the game that you already own. Its typical for games of the era, because piracy was so widespread. Why buy a game when someone has a copy? Why would I give someone a copy of something I paid money for?The single player championships offer time trials and a special kids mode where the game accelerates for you and you just steer. Its like watching tar dry from how dull it is. The other modes drive 50+ mph while the kids mode drives as a safe 30 mph. That's when I noticed that when you finish a race, you're forced to wait for the top four drivers to come in. On kids mode, this is a long wait, from half a minute to a full minute depending on how far ahead you were.In a championship, you will only proceed if you've finished in the top three. If you fail, then you'll have to use a continue. There is a save feature if you need to bail from the game and that's a nice feature to have. To add replay value you can enter your name in for time trials and championship results.There are three levels of difficulty: amateur, pro and championship class. Then you select between 6 and 12 horsepower to determine the speed. Its like selecting one level of difficulty before selecting another. On 6 horsepower its easy enough to get in the lead on the second lap and maintain it for two agonizing, dull minutes until the race ends. You also have a choice of how many laps. Even the minimum six laps feels long by the end even if races last two to four minutes long.Oh but then if you try out championship class, it turns into a real struggle, because on the third lap of each race, everyone else can just appear beside you. Its amazing to see being in first place and then four racers in a single perfect line will speed past you. To make things even more incredible, I can see that let's say the shark driver is in fourth place and then he will poof and be in first place without driving to first place. I can gain the lead, over-and-over again, but by the final lap its a single line of six cars that passes by. Its a questionable level of false difficulty.Even when you're racing through speedways, lakes, deserts, boardwalks and along side lava, nothing seems to mix the game up. It feels the same from track to track and a painful monotony sets in quick. Each track feels either heavily inspired by or flat out copied from another certain kart racer including the themes, layouts and shortcuts.The tracks are all in the same contained area so the only way to make a race longer is to add more hairpin turns on and that's what they do on more than half the tracks. These hairpin turns are never an issue with the slower 6 horsepower, but on the 12, that's when the game has real challenge. There are a pair of sharp turn buttons, but pressing them is too sharp and jarring of a turn to ever use effective. Plus they would be easier to use if they were mapped to the shoulders, but alas there's no way to change it.In terms of weapons, there are only five that you collect by running into them on the track. There are bombs to drop, oil cans to spill and make someone spin out, a pair of red bouncing balls that bounce off the edges, but when you launch them, they go sideways rather than forward. You also have a token triple fireball. All generic, vanilla weapons that would have been acceptable back then. Any weapon that is collected on the track is gone forever. If you have a weapon, then the pickups become obstacles that you will bounce off of.Then there's the primary weapon which is hedgehogs. These hedgehogs are living out their normal life on the track and you see them on toilets, doing sniper practice and dancing. Then you run down the hedgehogs and they become your ammunition. One hedgehog gives you four ammunition so you've collected its entire family out of whatever hole it was in. When you attack, they launch forward, its just as simple as that. A hedgehog would make the perfect weapon since its covered with spikes, but then who is willing to touch one to throw it. Maybe the go-karts have launchers.What makes the eight drivers so special that they're in a race and these hedgehogs are lesser creatures? That's like having a brawler where you pick up spider monkeys and attack people with them.It also seems like the player is the only driver that can get and use weapons and that always ensures that you have the advantage. The only time that I thought another driver was able to use a weapon was during the hardest difficulty, the championship class, I'd spin out for no reason. I assume that's someone behind me shooting me with a hedgehog (read that line again), but I never see the hedgehog or what hit me. So maybe I was just spinning out because I took a turn too sharp?I was unable to play the two player modes, but there is a duck shoot for single players where you can test your aim on the battlefield by shooting helpless ducks. Two shots will make a duck explode and you get a point.Playing in single player, there's a large vacant area of the screen dedicated to the sky. There's nothing in the sky and that's perhaps why other games of the era used half the screen as a giant map. Wacky Wheels does have a mini map, but its ineffective since the drivers on the map are one pixel big so I can never see at a glance where I am versus where everyone else is. Plus the drivers on the mini map have a color that blends in with the green map.Like all racing games, the main road lets you go at top speed while dirt, grass and side paths will make you go considerably slower. Lava and deep blue water will plunge you in where your racer becomes a periscope. When you've taken the plunge, its up to you to get back onto land. There is no floating lion with a fishing pole that will save you. Tracks like the boardwalk and lava castle are covered with borders which make cutting corners tough because you'll hit a wall and stop. The rough terrain and water traps are far more forgiving.With the game out of the way, now its time for the music. Wacky Wheels has a great 90s PC soundtrack. Its amazing how good it is compared to the rest of the game.Nostalgia aside, this is a game that has a lot more flaws than I remember. With so many choices for modern gamers, its tough to recommend this unless you have a 486 computer that limits your choices of racing games. Then its top notch!			",1121,324,51,104,96,15,167

												With the success of Super Mario Kart on the SNES, many other companies wanted a piece of the cartoony cart racing pie. Wacky Wheels is one of those, and among PC-gamers, it's one of the more famous ones.Before I get going with the review, I should point out that I had this game as a kid. I also had an SNES with Super Mario Kart. I did not play this game much.Graphics and soundWacky Wheels is a DOS game from 1994, and it looks the part. The sprites are big and colourful, but not very detailed, nor well animated. Still, it's not a bad looking game, all things considered. The different characters display a good amount of personality in their sprites, and this is really the strong point of the games looks.The sound is simple. There's nothing wrong with it, but apart from the main menu music, I'm struggling to remember anything about what the game sounded like, and that means that the sound design did its job, but not much more.GameplayWacky Wheels is an arcadey kart racer, and it has a lot in common with Super Mario Kart. You drive around a series of tracks, with the goal of getting to the finish line before anyone else. Like other kart racers, there are power-ups scattered along the track. You can always tell what it is that you're about to pick up, be it bombs, fireballs, oil patches or hedgehogs. Actually, the hedgehogs are what sets this game apart from its contemporary competitors. When you don't have any other weapon (all are single-use), using the fire button fires a hedgehog in a straight line, and if it hits an opponent, it makes them spin out. The hedgehogs are weaker than the other weapons, though as you can carry a lot of them, they become the main offense power. And you keep them between levels.There are some simple terrain hazards, like water, sand, and things placed in the track that forces you to be on your guard when you race, though these are generally not all that hard to avoid.The track design is a bit repetitive. While the game has 42 different tracks, they end up feeling quite similar after a little while, and none of them are particularly memorable. Much like any good Kart racer, this game offers a 2-player mode, and this is where it's at its best. Split screen racing can be good fun, if you can find someone else to play with. Racing against the AI is a passable experience, but the AI feels very rigid in how it acts (much like other kart racers from the era).But there's one big elephant in the room. The framerate. This has nothing to do with sloppy dosbox settings (which is often the case with DOS games on steam), the game really ran this poorly back in the days. It's supposed to run like this. And this sadly kills most of the fun, as the game feels sluggish and unresponsive. Final thoughtsWacky Wheels is a cart racer that tried to go up against Super Mario Kart back in the days. If you did not have SNES with Super Mario Kart, it was not a terrible game to spend your time with, in particular if you could invite a friend over to play with you. These days I don't see much of a reason to play it though, outside of nostalgia, the game feels sluggish and unresponsive, and there are better kart racing games out there.

(If you do have such ties, why are you reading this review?) It's not a very bad game per se, but it's just too technologically outdated for the somewhat oversaturated market of cart racing games to stay relevant....

												Quite a fun little DOS game. I have never played this before, so no nostalgia for me. You can pick up items and shoot them.  Plays and feels like the original mario kart. The original mario kart is better though in terms of graphics, gamplay and design. This game originally got released in 1994, 2 years after the original Super Mario Kart, and is therefore a copy. Default controls: Alt Gr to driveCtrl to fireArrow keys, or number pad to steer.Overall a thumbs up.			",390,91,23,35,36,2,58

												Wacky Wheels was a racing game from 3D Realms, the same company that brought us the Duke Nukem franchise. The first thing that would come to mind that this game is very similar to Super Mario Kart in many ways except the racers are all zoo animals. There are various enviroments and hazards in each race track to create a challenge along with bombs and hedgehog(whom each one does something strange on the track) that can be used as traps or projectile weapons. The game unfornately suffers from difficulty in both the tracks and hazards. There's various tracks with very sharp turns and I kept ramming myself into barriers or hazards. Due to the landscapes being flat it's hard to notice if I am on the track or about to collide against something without realizing it. The most annoying issue is that the kart you drive in can take damage if you keep ramming into hazards or walls. When that happens the racer flies out of the kart and crashes into the screen leaving a crack to create a fourth wall humor. And then you are force to start the race all over again. With enough practice I probably could get better at this game, but there's tons of better racing games out there. Wacky Wheels just never got the same popularity as Mario Kart did.

												I am sorry but this is not kind of game for me. I am sure it was amazing in its time but now I cant force myself to play it.Most of time I had difficulty to see where the track goes. Everything looks the same. There is no clear path to follow as colors are so bright one some tracks.I didnt know where am I supposed to go so I just tried to follow where everybody else goes.After few races all I feel is how my eyes hurt and I played only for couple minutes.Recoomend to play this only if you played it as a kid and you feel nostalgic.UPDATE: Checking other people videos I see game graphics looks different when I play. I tried different settings but with no help.If someone can tell me what I am doing wrong.... This is how it looks when I play:http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5cj2w3_wacky-wheels-pc-gameplay-hd_videogames ",593,202,50,94,80,8,149
