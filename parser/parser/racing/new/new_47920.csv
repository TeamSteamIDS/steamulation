												Excellent game.However.EA's policy on 3 installs stops you playing it.If you have to reinstall this game more than 3 times,  you cannot continue to play without getting support from EA. They give you a new cd key that only works on Origin.Your steam copy dies.---Edit---IF you remember to un register the game before uninstalling or wiping the Hdd, you reclaim a use.  But is that really on your mind when your new pc parts arrive for a new build?Easy to do if you are doing a clean install due to a corrupt Windows?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is by far one of the best Need For Speeds ever made if you are the kind of guy who likes simulated driving and realism. Great camera and great graphics. This game is not as good as it could be from the start though. You have to patch the game up a bit before it really is the best of the best. If you go to a website called nogripracing.com and sign up, you can download all the mods for this game. What I recomend you do, and this will be confusing to most of you your first time, but download and install the unofficial patch from no grip racing, then install PTMu which will give very realistic handling and car manuverability. At that point this game becomes an absolute masterpiece. I cannot stress enough how much fun this game really is. If you enjoy tuning and testing cars out, and then getting to race them, then I don't see a reason as to why you wouldn't love this game. You don't even need to play career mode, just buy a car and mess around with it. Too bad this game isn't as popular as it desserves to be and I'm afraid for that reason that EA won't make another ""Shift""... Please EA, this game is already very good, just make a refresh with better graphics and the PTMu time mod integrated and you'll have an extremely realisting yet very fun and challenging experience. Btw you should at least be using an xbox controller to play this game if not an actual wheel, that will give you much better control.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Forza 5 is the racer I really want to play but this game is scratching that itch for me at the moment on PC. The handling is very sensitive and each car takes some getting used to but is eventually very satisfying to drive. A good range of difficulty settings and driver assists which you can switch off means you can give yourself a fair challenge and feel satisfied when you drive well. The helmet camera and head physics were my favourite feature from the first Shift game and they return in Shift 2 to make the sensation of racing at speed only just in control of your car, really engaging. Unfortunately the immersion for me goes no further as there is no support for the Microsoft Xbox 360 Wireless Racing Wheel which is my wheel of choice on PC, although in fairness plenty of Logitech wheels are supported. This limitation plus the distinctly floaty nature of the cars' handling causes me to play this game as more of an arcade racer than I do a game like Forza 4, but it is still enjoyable when played with the right expectation. The trusty 360 gamepad is supported and works very well for racing as you would expect. The menus are mostly easy to navigate with the 360 pad but all the on-screen button prompts are for the keyboard. It took me a while to work out how to save settings with the controller (press start) but after some trial and error I can deal with the menus well enough.Shift 2 has a wide selection of real cars and tracks plus a smattering of fictional courses, some of which return from the first game. Full car customisation is provided allowing you to upgrade the performance and customise the appearance of the vehicles quite dramatically. Cars are given an overall performance rating and using this are separated into categories A, B, C, D just as in the original Shift game and familiar to players of other racing sims such as Forza Motosport.The game looks pretty good in 1080p and on my machine (i5, 7850, 8GB RAM) with all presets set to High runs at 50-70 frames per second on the whole, though on certain corners of certain tracks framerate drops into the high 30s. I would like to tweak my settings a bit more to achieve a minimum of 60 but the game offers no benchmark mode so checking the effect of a graphics setting takes a long time - many changes even require you to restart the game. It is also disappointing that the low resolution cutscenes were clearly pre-rendered with consoles in mind which makes the unskippable cinematics during the career mode look very out-dated - cinematics should be used to flatter a game, but in the case of Shift 2 it's a relief to get past them and into the game which itself looks very attractive.The Autolog and Online play require an EA Origin account (though the game does not require the Origin client). Unlike some players on the community hub I had no trouble at all activating the game or fighting with any DRM. The game installed and played easily from Steam just like any other game. Steam Overlay popped up showing me the product key when I first launched the game but I dismissed that as I have never had to type it in yet. I have tried to get an online match on two occassions and both times I was the only player online and had to create a lobby. Hopefully the sale weekend will get some new players lobbying up but I would not recommend this title if you are looking for multiplayer racing. It does provide a satisfying single player experience for players who enjoy racing against AI and testing themselves on simulations of the best cars and circuits in motorsport.To my mind this game was a good buy at the recent sale price of £4.99 but I would hesitate to recommend it at the current full price of £19.99. It is true there are not a lot of other games of this type available on the PC which have the same degree of polish as Shift 2 Unleashed, but there are definitely better experiences out there on Steam for your hard-earned £20.

												I played this game using the unofficial community patch by nogripracing, so I have no experience with the Vanilla version. Also I didn't delve deep into the tuning options and online.As of this writing I clocked in around 37 hours and I am confident to say I really love this game. I played through the first SHIFT and it was my first ever racing game that made the cockpit view comfortable to play with. SHIFT 2 refined the experience with their new Helmet Cam -- The camera is attached to the driver's helmet and it mimics the head movement and shakiness when driving, gives you tunnel vision, and it blurs your vision when you hit a wall. A lot of people say the camera is disorienting, but personally I don't really think so. I was not once disorientated, confused or the effects got in the way of the gameplay. SHIFT 2 is arguably the only racing game that lets you truly be the driver, rather than be the car itself. You feel how scary speed is when driving at 200 miles per hour, underestimate the car, and the car will severely punish you. This what made this game so great for me.Now for the negatives. The menu system is stylish, but atrocious. The key assignments for the buttons are all over the place. I am playing using the 360 controller and the game can't reassign the button icons to match the controller's.Earning money is way too easy. Want to buy that certain car? Grind in Quick Race once your driver level is high. Select the Dakota Oval track, set it to one lap and no opponents, and bam, $20,000 per 35 seconds.Visual customization is basic and practically useless.The slightest bump and the slightest touch to the dirt will send your car spinning. To be fair, I haven't rammed a car or drove off-road in real life before, but these annoyances can ruin the entire race because the AI suddenly bumped into you or you get sucked to the dirt like a black hole.Some of the DLCs are way too easy and one DLC broke the game's pace. The Speedhunter pack gives you the drag racing career, quarter mile career and access to some highly tuned cars. The problem is the cars are free to acquire. I won the drag race and quarter mile career without breaking a sweat because I had free access to the stupidly fast Nissan GT-R. Some of these cars can be used to your default career and I breezed past some of the events.My narrator-guy-person-thing is annoying. I loved the British guy in SHIFT 1 and while the new guy is alright, he's too, uh... Not... I dunno. He's not British-ey and kawaii enough.I hate drifting. I hate drifting in SHIFT 1, and I hate drifting in SHIFT 2.The title of the game is stupid. Really? SHIFT 2 Unleashed? What's next? SHIFT 3 Insurrection? SHIFT 4 Reloaded?Overall I love this game. The negatives are there and noticeable, but the core gameplay, the cars, the races, the tracks, the sights and sounds, are all great.			",171,26,5,23,8,0,12

												i have played all NFS games ever, well, almost all of them. and i have played my share of other racing games, i will put it simple and useful, lets go through the features;Gameplay (+)---------------lots of cars, lots of tracks, realistic drivingi have played Grid 1 and 2, this game is more realistic tan the two.i have not played Assetto Corsa, Project Cars (is not released yet) or Grid AS, but driving in this game is realistic and enjoyable.I thave set the Traction Control and Stablitiy Control nad Best Line to ""off"", Handling Mode to Elite, Steering and Braking Assist to ""off"", Anti-Lock Brakes and Damage to ""on"", and i cant ask for a more REAL, challenging driving experience.Old cars are harder to control and newer cars (meaning newer technology) are easier to control.very enjoyable experience. im playing with a XBOX 360 Controller for PC, and the vibration adds to the feel of driving alot.no, you cant handbrake in the tight corners like other NFS titles, you have to learn how to control your car.so a new track means hours of trying and learning with those ""elite"" settings.this game has a real, working car tuning options, so for instance reducing or increasing the pressure of tires really change the way your car behave in corners.<<THIS GAME IS NOT ABOUT HOW FAST YOU CAN DRIVE, ITS ABOUT HOW GOOD YOU CAN DRIVE.>>i have only seen this real tuning settings in one game, and that was VW GT.this game consists of a very nice replay system, after your race you can watch your driving. intense stuff!AI (+)---------------your competitors learn from your driving and your behaviour, so if you tripped them out of the track they will do the same to you if they catch up to you.Graphics (+)---------------for a 2011 game, it looks amazing.it sure looks better than Grid 2 and Grid AS.there is a real damage to your car and your (track) environment. you can crash your car, break your windshield, bust one wheel out and still drive if the damage did not destroy your engine. but you wont get too far!my pc (FX8350 and GTX780) can not maintain a solid 60 fps on everything maxed. you can watch a video of mine, displaying the game's amazing graphics  here.Vehicles (+)---------------you have access to lots of vehicles (around 160).these consist of Supersport cars, street cars, customized old cars, performance cars etc.you have a wide selection of car customization, tunings, visuals, decals, vinyls, engines, gearboxes etc.Races (+)---------------missed drifting and drag race from NFS Underground?they are back in this game! more realistic and a lot harder though!you need to learn to tune your cars to get to that millie second which makes you the winner.Game Performance (-)---------------Crashes, low FPS issues and freezes are common.Sound (-/+)---------------music mostly is horrible, repetetive and boring (depressive?) but the sound effects and car sounds are realistic and great.overall (+)---------------this is a great game. replayablitiy is high due to difficult challenges and there is a still alive multiplayer and competition going on.9/10Recommended!

												I've played NFS: HS (Road Challenge), PU (P 2000), HP 2, MW '05, MW '10 and this - a true NFS fan, that is.Pros:- Physics, realistic loss of traction at high speeds (aye, I've also driven a real car at high speed and lost traction, so I would know).- Lots of interesting game modes.- Lots of interesting tracks, specifically I like how this game doesn't do cheap stuff like track mirroring or obnoxious night time ice skating to bump up difficulty. I also like how some tracks have several variants with common bits.- No catch-up! You actually get what you deserve as far as I can tell. Difficulty is dynamically adjusted in the beginning of each race according to your performance but never mid-race as it used to be.- Graphics are stunning, camera options are good and make a lot of sense (e.g. two different in-cockpit cams with different settings).- Background graphics because no flux were given :D- Lots of settings for the car*- No DLC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, existing cars are all good enough to beat the events, your friends and even clock some serious records.Cons:- Loads of CTDs and sound bugs. For me the source of CTD persists over the CTD, e.g. if I was playing track A with settings XYZ and it crashes, it's gonna crash with track A and XYZ no matter how many times I restart the game. Then again, it fixes itself if I play A with settings XCV or if I play track B.- ...loooong intro videos, yet to look into disabling them. This would be tolerable if for not so many CTDs.- General handling settings. I play with KB and like many people have mentioned, there's a lot of input lag. This, however, is not a true con, because you can always disable the ""stabilising"" setting:=> Edit DampeningEnabled=""1"" string to ""0"" in vehicleset_pc_custom_[controller name here].xmlAlso the default settings for tuning are very very loose and unresponsive at times, do not forget to edit.- While settings are plenty (see pros), the poor default settings force you to make your own. There are a lot of settings there and the explanations for each setting are decent at best - a bit of a learning curve to get them right and you'll need to tap into actual tuning guides for real world cars to get the most out of your ride.- Lamborghini Murcielago LP640 is a Limited Edition only car by default. There are guides to unlock LE cars and events, though, but it's a bit of a nuisance and you'll need to edit the master .exe to achieve this.TL;DR: To get everything out of this game lots of fiddling with game files, game settings and car settings is involved. For this reason I'm going to give 9/10. Otherwise a brilliant, brilliant game.EDIT: This edit is two years after the original review.Changes from my perspective:- The game no longer CTDs...that often. I have reinstalled the game on the same platform but new install of Windows 7, so not much should have changed.- Bought a racing wheel, yay!A wheel definitely helps with some of the rear-wheel drives since it's easier to control the amount of turning than it is with a keyboard. Especially the McLaren F1 and BMW M1 became really pleasant to drive.Settings are still plenty and wide, most of the suspension settings and angles I've learnt to work with but the exact nature of some settings is a mystery to me. I understand them from a literate background but sometimes the car isn't terribly responsive.For most parts I still do agree with my review, though, so if the game is on sale it's a good buy. It's still the best simulator from the NFS series, for whatever that counts.			",4,0,1,3,2,0,2

												I've read through the reviews - laughing. So many reviews about the game crashing 24/7 or whatsoever. I can't even recall that it has crashed. I've played both Shift and Shift 2 on my Xbox360 before I got this on pc. Both were great. Looking back at previous Need for Speed games, these two were big improvements. Doesn't feel like Need for Speed, but it's still awesome. I am quite pleased, BUT two things I can think of now that really bothers me are the Al behavior and those childish cutscenes.The Al are challenging, but in a bad way. I play on hard difficulty because I like a challenge. However, the Al opponents keep hitting and crashing into me, even each other. Looks like they're really trying hard to push you of the track instead of finishing the race. These cutscenes just makes me feel bad. They talk about racing and how it is in real life. It's a long speech which you cannot skip.Despite those childish cutscenes and deathwish Al opponents, the game is amazing.- Runs smooth 24/7 with optimal graphics (Not crashing at all).- Lots of tracks- A much bigger selection of cars than earlier games. You can have as many as you want and in addition several of the exact same car. Even cars from previous decades can be driven.- Drifting is completely different from NFS Carbon where it doesn't feel realistic at all.- Just driving at all is exciting. Often I just drive without opponents in cars I love.- It is nice to see they use many of the same cars they've used before.I am happy that they actually made Need for Speed that can be called somewhat realistic. Playing Hot Pursuit made me feel bad, watching the trailer for the newest Need for Speed doesn't make me feel any better. I am very pleased with this game. This is a game for everyone who either loves racing or simply enjoys driving.			",25,0,3,6,0,0,0

Note: 7/10First of all, I think this game deserves better reviewing notes.Is it an excellent driving simulator? No, it is not. But it isn't arcade.Does this version present problems (like invisible vinyls, loss of captures...)? Yes, it does.Can you spend time driving classic tuned cars, drifting with them, competing in real circuits with GT cars and have fun during more hours than with many other game' campaigns? Of course yes.Between old kings Undergrounds and Shift saga there is 'awesome' sh*t!Better this than Burnout-police-tuning experiments...			",143,27,13,12,7,1,9

												This has all the makings of an excellent game - slick presentation, interesting tracks and cars, and a GT-like progression through the various tiers of racing.  Unfortunately it has a huge problem with car handling due to input lag.  You press the accelerator or turn the wheel and the game reacts half a second later.  This is a known and widely recognised issue (google it) and there is no fix as it appears to a be a fundamental game engine problem.The slower cars, you can drive around this, but on the faster cars its very noticable / annoying and the handling become batsh!t crazy.  I'm a good sim racer with excellent reactions but this problem is not fun so with great regret I am now uninstalling.			",226,16,19,26,25,1,31

												This game is my favorite racing game and I always use it to get my through my Forza-thirst whenever a new Forza game comes out (I don't have an Xbox).I think this racing game is really really great. However, I can't recommend it to anyone because of a long list of bugs and problems to look out for.First, this game ships with broken Physx so your tutorial race probably will crash the game immediately. There's a workaround for this, but this shouldn't happen in the first place.Next, even though the multiplayer is dead, sometimes a track will crash on loading as it contacts EA's servers. The workaround is to play with your internet disabled, but that shouldn't happen either. And finally, if you do everything you should, this game will crash anyways. Quite a bit. Fortunately, it's typically before the race starts, but sometimes it will in the middle of the race anyways.In the end, I think this is a really good racing game, but is so buggy for something from a major publisher and major franchise that I can't recommend it. However, if you can overlook these flaws, this is a really fun and cheaply-priced Forza-like racing game. When it plays, it's fantastic. But it WILL crash on you and you WILL need to do silly workarounds to get it to stop crashing most of the time. ",212,36,9,12,17,5,28

												Need for Speed all who grew up with that franchise know what that means. Fast cars, nice roads/tracks and lots and lots of action. Even the cops need a rest and so the Shift2 train leaves for arcade and simulation city...  but is it a real simulation then? Back in the day and compared to Race07, GTR2 and other real racing sims of that time Shift2 is no hardcore sim neither is it today.    Compared to Project CARS, Shift2 is more arcade sim racer than hardcore sim. So if you want a real racing sim you better switch to Assetto Corsa or Project CARS. For me Shift is a very good game if you can get used to the sim/arcade controls with that touch of simulation We have  static weather (mid-day, dusk and night) and for today´s standard kinda rusty graphics. Driving through the night however is still impressive as your and your opponents headlights the only light source on the track so when you drive in the middle field you can see nice lighting effects on the cars infront of you and see the packs headlights in the rearview mirror. The sound is superb imho.  The ricer Turbo sounds amazing when it kicks in, exhaust backfire sounds are awesome! For car lovers yeah that´s the kinda sound we wanna hear. The Career mode has lots of different races which will be unlocked when you level up your driver level. The higher your driver level the more upgrades, vinyls and stuff will be available to turn your standard car in a roaring racing car. AI  behavior seems legit to me but you have to upgrade your car otherwise you´re not leading the pack! Shift2 also includes official GT3 and GT1 races which were the reason I bought it. These races will put all your skills to the test. Multiplayer is still available but you should have friends around to fill the mostly empty lobby. If you like racing games this is definitely worth a buy.			",213,32,18,8,6,0,19

												I have really wanted to like this game since it came out and I bought it on console for the first time. I played it some, and had a good time but it always felt strange to me. Eventually, I traded it I and bought it on PC, and I figured out what was wrong. Shift 2 is a pretty solid game overall, it's got good visuals, a lot of cars, some good customization... But it's plagued by its gameplay. For some reason, this game has baked in control lag. I've tried tons of different methods of fixing it, to no avail. It literally makes the game unplayable, that's a shame because I liked this game. Maybe they fixed it at some point, who knows. I feel like it would be too late at this point anyway.

												I don't know what universe the developers of this game come from but it's certainly not this one. The cars in this game do not behave like any on this earthly realm. Delight as opponent cars suddenly become weightless if approached from behind. Ohhh as they fly off into the sky. Gasp as your car spins out of control for no apparent reason on a flying straight.The whole game is depicted as a simulation racer, and some people will tell you that it is. I don't like those people. This game, like GRID is an arcade racer dressed up as a sim. Set your expectations accordingly and you will have a lot of fun with it. Physics quirks and all.The sound design is excellent, cars are super loud and sound like they are exploding continuously as you engine break. The sense of speed is also very good if you use the bumper cam but is lost somewhat when using the cockpit view, there is also a helmet cam which is completely disorientating and weird and is only a novelty. The game is also very pleasant to look at.Overall I give it CARSFLYINGEVERYWHEREOHGOD/10.			",768,128,63,67,65,2,134

												Ive played this game before but thought ill buy it for myself, since its on sale :). first of all i would highly recommend getting a steering wheel for this game as it really dont feel like it was made for a controller. Second i had a few bugs with this game that i had to fix manually, besides those problems it is a really good game. it does take some time to get used to aswell im using the the Logitech Driving Force Gt Wheel & it works great without having to do any setup with this game unless you want to swap from automatic to manual. if you want a even more realistic game i would highly recommend Assetto Corsa and even no thats in early access i still think that is a better all round racing experience and is very polished even now in its early stages. all in all i would recommend this game its a good, fun driving game with a nice amount of tuning and as a nice selection of cars & tracks Nürburgring is my favorite which Assetto corsa does not have....yet.

												I just want to make this as clear and understandable as possible So there is this game GTR 2 witch is FIA racing simulator - and there are many of these games, but GTR 2 stands out from all of them... till this game came out... you see... I've been playing simulators for a long time (with wheel) and when I got my hands on this game... it was on spot, perfect driving experience from the first minute as I started the try-out laps with Nissan GTR... I had no complaints about handling, or physics... just watch some actual, real racing championship events, and how intense it really is, and feels as a spectator all alone, when you watch the race from cockpit... this game has no comparison to any other... and trying to copy this game - well Forza and Gran Turismo won't do it... but they know, that this game is the real deal, when it comes to experiencing real racing adrenalin rush - my first thought was ""damn... I am moving"" I was so gripped by the sound, the feel, the ""helmet cam"", that I forgot about track, and next thought was ""ow a corner - trajectory, apex, brake, follow-trough, and accelerate"" and it did so well at the first time hands-on, that there was no need for assistants - in this game, everything is so seriously over-thought that it blew my mind - I really felt like playing GTR 2 but with that adrenalin rush and confusion and body movement that game physics provide as you are driving... you can't get that in GTR 2, Forza and Gran Turismo... When developers made this game they thought - ""This is REAL racing"" ""Racing Simulator"" - do some of these players here even understand how serious that is? to actually be able to drive with high-tech FIA racing car....? .... forget the car.... do some of people can imagine how advanced your level of self-control has to be in your mind alone, to be able to compete in that sport...And when some over-rated company (EA) takes their budget and allows some under-rated racing simulator company (SlightlyMadStudios) to take charge on this project, just to bring all missing pieces - for EA it is physics and driving experience - and for SlightlyMadStudios it is flashy graphics... it just blows off so much that you just can't approach this game as you are used to approach the Gran Turismo or Forza.... it takes huge amount of patience and dedication to be able to just drive quick and fast...( I just got lucky because I am GTR 2 racer, and my driving is not moveable at all from some twitches and flashy graphics - this is GTR based physics game witch is realistic as it can get and complain, I was hands down used to controls from the first corner ) to be able to know when to overtake... you have to read the track every time differently because opponent makes the track a different piece every time... you need to practice driving in the group... you have to start, to re-think how racing actually is meant... in Forza and Gran Turismo - it's meant like ""overtake me, if you are moving faster then me, but please, my dear friend"" but RACING is a competition and the first competition you have to overcome, is yourself... you have to find out what kind of racer you are, and if you want to get to the finish line, then the most aggressive move you can pull off is ""the nose-dive"" - and if you think that in this game AI will give up the 1st place easily, you are fooling yourself because just like in real life you have to EARN IT and THEN you can TAKE IT... not the other way around, like it is in Forza and Gran Turismo.... and I wont say that Forza and Gran Turismo is a bad games... but to this game, Forza and Gran Turismo is just another test-drive game in the market.... if you want some real thrill then pick this game up... You have to approach this game seriously, otherwise you'll be another mad-man on the comment section... don't mind that I am writing like a mad game-fan - I am not.... I am just cabined furniture designer who likes to play games a bit in my free-time..... but I am just tired how this game is being treated...you have to be serious, otherwise you get much different opinion then it's meant... this is FIA Racing Simulator - and for the last words... Just watch the real-life race...			",15,2,6,5,2,0,0

												To me, this game is basically the first NFS Shift but with a voice over that I have to mute and lots of random crashes for no apparent reason. Some tracks work, some crash before it even gets past the loading screen. I've played around with the graphics and I have no idea what is going on.If it weren't for the crashes I would recommend this game, otherwise it's pretty pointless buying a game you can only half play. You're better off getting the first one.			",96,13,4,19,2,0,6

												I can't say enough good things about Shift 2 for the PC. It's literally one of the choppiest games with some of the worst aliasing I've ever seen on the consoles. I considered it one of the worst games I owned when I bought the PS3 version but the power of the PC made this game a completely different experience.  60fps instead of 30 with the ability to remove all of the hideous aliasing that exists on the console version turns this into one of the more exciting race games to date. It's not pure sim but it is very sim like and works incedibly with a good wheel. Graphics are just a tad dated but the locales, feeling of speed and handling make it really great. 9 out of 10 on PC (1 out of 10 on consoles).			",107,3,31,5,2,0,0

												This ""Need for speed"" game has the worst Physics of any racing game i have played.The sound is rubish and very anoying, all you hear alot of the time is the exhaust pipe rattling and distorted engine sounds and the sounds from other cars when in cockpit view are far to loud and overpower yours. (I got a Sound Blaster Z, so its not my PC's fault)On the dark tracks the dash is unreadable most of the time because the lighting is crap.The difficulty curve is ridiculousy high, tune your car so you can actually drive a fun ride and the AI are unbeatable on some tracks. the only way to win is to tune your car as slow as you can because then the AI are exponentially easier.It's a shame because Shift 1 is pretty good but this one is a total waste of money.

												Honestly the best Semi-Sim racing game I have played. This is a game that does have a learning curve, and a definite amount of patience. The drifting in this game is splendid, as you can beat the entire series if you can put enough time and effort into a car's tuning (Beat the series with the old Alfa). Tons of fun, would reccomend to anyone. The only flaw I have with this game is that you have to disconnect to your WiFi to play the game, as most of the tracks you want to drive on, Ebisu for example, are broken because of Autolog.

												Shift 2 is actually quite good - basically the same like Shift but with a different level system and with tracks with night time.Sadly, the Steam version is buggy. I've experienced several sound bugs such as a silent Pagani Zonda F and as soon as I reached the Works races, crashes appear more frequently.It seems like that these problems only occur in the Steam version. That's pretty much why I downvote this game. If it's true, I'd rather suggest you getting a key for Origin.Otherwise it's a pretty good game.			",87,13,5,3,6,1,4

												Ok i gotta have my part. For those who compare this game to forza or gran turismo have to stop its not the same nobody seems to remember any of the need for speed games at all, shift 2 compared to the rest of nfs copies is by far the best in physics sound and gameplay. tho i do miss the open world. the worst race type nfs has made was pro street this is by far way better as for the people that whinge about the input delays play around with your dam sensativity in ya advanced options default is the worst set up it effects both control and wheel.The game itself is fantastic in sound and the added in body roll physics once again people that are having issues gettin a car to get around a track fast and cornering right learn how to do a setup on ya can itself... If you get the right setup both for control and car the game is a fantastic sim. games like gran turismo and forza on console are just horrible with the fact it feels there is no suspension at all until you get into cornering as i have been a fan on gran turismo since the beginning.(finished all GT sims since GT1 on PS1) That is one other thing this game does not lack with the bouncing and cornering it just takes a bit of tweeking.stop crying bout this game its based on the old nfs's and in my opinion it is by far the best racing game nfs has tweek it a bit and compared to most sim race games it is great sound 10/10 graphics 8/10cars 10/10    after DL the all cars modphysics 8/10 after tweeking controls and car settings			",25,1,4,4,4,0,4

												Whether you're a casual automotive enthusiast or a die-hard gearhead, you need to experience Shift 2 Unleashed yourself. Despite the ever-changing universe of the Racing Simulation genre, the now-""dated"" Shift 2 Unleashed still manages to hold its own. Fantastic graphics and detail on even the smallest design flourishes of the automobile are flanked by locations rendered in breathtaking accuracy. I actually tone down the graphics detail so that my computer can run it more smoothly, and it still never fails to impress. The smooth curves of a European exotic or the broadshouldered sheetmetal of American muscle are simply beautiful. From the stellar vehicle physics to the oh-so-cool Helmet View (simulating head toss, automatic look-to-the-apex, and G-Force vision blur) this game offers a great outlet to do exactly what racing games were always meant to do: access cars you could never afford on tracks you could never master, and another reason to Take It Off The Street in real life. Regardless if you're an import tuner, exotic obsesser, or a Yankee Hot Rodder like myself, there's something for everyone in this game. So before dropping a stack of cash on the newest Forza title, this humble yesteryear runnerup is worth a look. Smoke 'em if you got 'em.			",21,3,3,2,2,0,0

												So I bought this game off of literally a flip of a coin. That coin flip was easily one of the best I've ever made. As of this writing I've only put in 2 hours yet I cannot recommend this game enough. Being a huge fan of sim games, but not the biggest car nut I was able to set up the difficulty exactly as I wanted it, and needed it. No HUD (I always try to get rid of this whenever I can in a  game) with Medium AI, but I cannot do without on a racing sim is the guide lines which is my lifeline in a game like this, so it really really really aided me to be able to have it enabled despite going through the game without any HUD whatsoever. The handling of the cars feels extremely realistic to my nooby racing sim hands, and the sounds made by the cars have forced me to change my underwear 4 times already. I cannot stress enough how ♥♥♥♥ING SEXY these cars sound, It's like angels screaming death metal at me through the voice of sirens, I love it so much. In the end. This game is so worth it.

Even faster than all class A supercars? LOL What did you done. This game shouldn't be called as a racing sim in any way.Still recommending the game as there aren't many car racing games on pc nowadays. 7/10EDIT: After some other testing, it appears that lambo reventon is one of the fastest cars in the game, but not the fastest.

												One of the worst racing games to play with the steering wheel. I can't manage my DFGT to work properly with this game. Can't be accurate with the car, it feels floaty somehow, never experienced something like this in any other game. It's impossible to pass the corner like you want, because the car behaves completely different than you want. So if you're going to use the wheel to play this game - just don't. The game is better using the xbox controller, you could be more accurate, you have more control over the car. But still it's one of the worst racing games out there. Better play some other game instead.The game is pretty old but the performance is bad. You can't skip the damn intro and those annoying cut scenes.There's autolog which should allow you to see your friends results and records, but sadly it doesn't work. You probably need to create EA account for this.Afterall it's EA, you can't expect a good game from them, they ruin everything.			",698,388,38,103,107,5,116

												I'd like to give this a sideways thumb because it's honestly a great game, one of the closest games to Forza or Gran Turismo you'll get on PC but it's plagued with technical issues thanks to the passing of time. Some such issues are related to Autolog, which I believe has been long since abandoned which now crashes the game for players, such as myself and requires players to either block certain ports through their firewall or to turn off their internet - just to prevent these problems from happening. Other issues also include the three installs and you're dead situation, where you can only activate the game three times before the key going away, although you can unactivate it, most people either won't remember or won't get the chance ie if their computer dies. Absolutely hate 3rd-party DRMs, developers need to stop and take CD Projekt Red's practices into consideration.Moving away from technical problems.The game is brilliant. The amount and quality of content in this game is superb. This game has a massive selection of variety when it comes to cars and tracks. 160 cars is a lot for a racing game and sure you can compare it to games such as Forza 4 at 600 or Gran Turismo (I don't actually know the amount for GT6, I remember GT5 being around 1200) but it doesn't really matter. The car choice in this game focuses on cars that matter in their perspective, which is generally the well known cars such as the Corvette ZR1, Lamborghini Gallardo or Porsche 911 GT3. It doesn't really have any ""trash"" filler cars as such, apart from the Legends DLC, free on PC, which introduced things like the Mini and the Alfa Romeo Giulia Sprint GTA, which I don't mind, most of the cars are an enthralling experience to drive due to excellent sound design and well made cockpits. There's a view mode that allows the player to not just drive in first person but there's a helmet overlay that feels realistic and the camera moves when approaching a corner. Dials and screens inside cars all light up and work, like the Caterham has a working, although I wouldn't say incredibly realistic Water Temperature monitor which adds to the immersion. Not just this, but full car customization is also put into play. You have full control over tuning and modifying parts for your car. Want to engine swap a Nissan Silvia S15 and take out the SR20DET with a Skyline engine. Sure. It's freedom over car design is a definite plus.Gameplay consists of a mainly realistic racing experience, not the simulator experience of Assetto Corsa, which puts me off a little bit nor the overly arcade experiences found in your other modern Need for Speed titles since Undercover. It's always intense and if you're like me and turn off every assist, turn up the difficulty, you'll be in for an extraordinary time. Graphically it's top of the line, 2011 graphics. Yes I'm saying this looks (on MAX settings, which mind you, on my R9 280X only reaches 45-50 FPS on some tracks, strangely) better than most of the games that came out in 2011. The reflections, bloom FX, which I find disorientating at times, textures, etc are just really good. Campaign is good. Not much to say, it's sort of like an RPG, you level up and with that you get cash, liveries and rims. You do different events for XP and cash, that's pretty much it. And then you can challenge famous drivers and take their highly modified cars. And finally Tracks. There's a lot of Tracks and variations in NFS Shift 2. Renowned tracks like Silverstone, Brands Hatch, Suzuka Circuit and many others feature in Shift 2 with night variations and different weather variations. Brilliant. Different terrains on different tracks heavily impact your car and it's traction. If you manage to drift offroad and into sand, you're done for. Nothing is holding you back from doing a barrel roll right into the wall. And this has happened to me, most notably in the lighter cars I drive, like the Lotus Elise and the Caterham. With that they come with their own realistic sound effects which again helps boost immersion.So all in all - it's great. Despite the technical problems it's had, I consider it one hell of a racing game. I find racing in this way more intense than the likes of Gran Turismo.Pros- Variety of quality content.- Truly immersive.- Car Customization a definite plus.Cons- Technical problems related to DRM- DRMRating: 8/10, despite technically issues.

A developer that made the infamous Project Cars made this. The handling of the car is so bad. There is so much lag input that I barely can play this. Also, the camera for the third-person view super ♥♥♥♥ed up. It shakes even when the car is not at high speed. The camera is too loose for my liking. In the end, I ragequitted on this game for having barely playable controls.			",83,3,10,2,8,0,3

You cant drift with a wheel not the g27 atleast, You spin out so fast its not even funny (using pro settings and all assist off) people might say its becaus of my settings being too hard but not really this is a universal complaint amongst more hardcore drifters! well what if you dont want to drift? does this game maybe suit you? if you use a controller and automatic yes! if either of those questions was no i would NOT reccomend this game to you it automaticly switches around with the force feedback and gearing settings (from manual to automatic on some race but then if you pressed countinue to next race its fixed after that but might come bk later) one race my force feedback could be gone completly and ive got automatic (even tho my settings say 100% and manual) next i could have a crippling forcefeedback problem making my wheel change from 40 degree left to 40 degree right as hard as it can! i might have manual but i cant drive with that			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you played the console version, well then you were stuck with what EA gave you (i know i had PS3 version). However, the PC version can be modded and as such can turn this game from what some say a crappy arcade to a compelte SIM as SMS intended it to be. Althought he game plays fantastic on a pad, and is easy to drive which in some cases is more fun than tedious simulation, with a few mods and wheel it can pose an amazing challenge. I have uploaded videos from two races and have made a mod available to download @ nogripracing (check the forums sub section for SHIFT). Download, extract, inject and enjoy racing once more!Check out my videos to see how the game is with the mods I am running. NOTE: I took SEVERAL tries to get the clean video, there were a many crash, flip, bump, oversteer, understeer, you name it happend.I recommned this game no matter what, especially if you want a simulation, just install the mods I mention :)			",82,8,23,7,5,0,1

												You can have lots of fun playing Shift 2 if you have an adaquate computer and a good steering wheel.  Even then you will probably have to turn most of the stability aids on, in order to not be driving on ice.  With my computer you need something better than a G27 for this game to be drivable.  A Thrustmaster T500 will do, but it will probably break after a few months.   Be prepared to do quite a bit of tweeking to get this game to remotely resemble real driving.  There is a patch to fix some of this that has been released by gamers, but it cannot be applied to the Steam version.  So maybe the bargain bin at Frys or equivalant would be the best place to buy this game.  The good thing about this games is it is fun, you can drift through turns at 150mph and not wreck.  In fact you will have to learn to do this because the cars are continuously loosing grip.  It looks pretty good too for it's age.  You can easily customize you cars apperance and performance.This game has no multiplayer ability.The worst thing about this game is the AI.  It is horrendous.  I frequently have wished that I had the programmer tied up in my basement so that I could slowly beat them to death with a chain.Really, it is that bad.  This was programmed by the same people who still don't seem to be able to do a competent AI in Project Cars.  So be prepared for opponents that you beat the entire race, have a huge lead on, and then magically appear at the last turn driving faster than is possible to beat you  (rubber-banding).Also be prepared to be smashed into becasue the AI is not actually intelligent.  These other cars will do little if anything to avoid crashing into you, and will at times actively seek to crash into you.  It doesn't matter at all if you drive like a gentleman youself.  You may not think this is a big deal, but if you spend a half hour in an endurance race, and have a chance of winning then some nimrod bumps you off the track, and in Shift2 you are the one who gets the penalty and you lose.  This will happen over and over, and you too will wish the programmers were tied up in your basement.			",12,0,3,0,0,0,6

												NOTE: I bought this on Steam but play through Origin. It seems to have mitigated most of the driver/crashing issues that come from launching on Steam.Shift 2 is actually one of my favorite racing games. I leave most of my racing sims on XBOX, but often return to play this. The engine sounds, as well as the 'impression of high speeds' make this a winner for me. Graphically, it is beautiful for its time. Lastly, one of the really cool effects is the 'inside-the-helmet' view. If you've ever raced a car, you know that you look into the turn, rather than just straight ahead (which is the perspective for most, if not all, racers) and this aforemetioned view does that perfectly.

												I got this game in hopes that it would be something of a Forza for PC. The car selection looked good, the track selection was not terrible but sadly, this is not really a product I can recommend, especially for those looking for a more serious, mature and functional experience.  1.) The intro video's are too loud, To the point where I had to go in the config files of the game to remove them so that they would not blow out my headphones every time I start the game. Minor annoyance but still worth noting.  2.) Very unstable. This game will crash when loading tracks, it will crash in the middle of races and there is very little that one can do about it. I had to actually reinstall the game entirely (verifying steam install did not help) to make a certain track even load without crashing.  3.) Really poor controls for the gamepad. This one took me by surprise, I would have thought that a game like Need for speed would be extremely controller friendly but sadly that is not the case. The cars feel floaty and unresponsive. There also seems to be some input lag that I can't really explain, it's a common issue that many complain about and for good reason (especially after enjoying the fantastic controls in F1 2013 and GTR2 on gamepad specifically).  4.) Unskippable intro videos to different race types during career. This is where the maturity falls through. When you select new race types, you are greeted with one of two (or three) ""edgy"" racing guys telling you how extreme they are and how much they love speed (and whatever else) while they describe the basics of the race type. I would not make a big deal of this but it is unskippable and their ""personalities"" are grating and immature at best. It's almost embarassing to watch.  5.) Rather silly race structure. Like other NFS games, you can't do a qualifying lap, you just start the race in whatever grid position that the game randomly puts you in. This is frustrating because you are usually faster than the AI (more about the AI next) and not having any means to compete for a grid position takes away control that you should really have.  6.) The AI is pretty awful. When you play a game like F1 2013 (or any other semi-realistic racing game), you will find that the AI is usually pretty conservative about risks, they won't crash into you too much and they won't try run you off the road. In this game however, the AI is really not out to win as much as it is out to make sure they crash into you and with the handling and physics the way it is, almost every collision (no matter how minor) will result in you spinning off the track or into a wall. This may not seem like a huge deal, you may say ""get good"" but you will understand once you see just how needlessly aggressive they are.  I don't often like to trash games and write negative reviews, I usually try to find the silver lining in any product that I purchase and while there are moments that I really do enjoy this game, it's overall quality leaves a lot to be desired and I will certainly not buy another NFS game in the future.

												Well its a jekyl and hyde affair really with what could of been the best racing game ever, but ruined a bit by a couple of flaws.What it gets right is the track realism, the variety of cars, the custom options, the career mode and there is plenty of challenge in there for all. You can customise your cars setup, tune it, and the realism of the cockpits and sounds seem to represent the real life cars. V6s, V8s V12s and turbos all sound different.Unfortunately the things it gets wrong is the cars handling is a bit unresponsive with gamepads as there is some sort of controller input lag on this setup, but ive heard this isnt the case if using wheels.The other annoying thing is the Computer cars AI is excessively aggressive at times, where they will deliberately swerve off their racing line to shunt you off the road when you attempting to overtake. The collision physics is all wrong and biased here too in favour of the computer cars, whereby a tiny contact will send your car shooting off like a rocket whilst the computer car barely gets affected.Shame really, because is could of all been amazing but its let down by some flaws. Overall would give a 7/10, but it could of been a 9 or 10 if the other issues were fixed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

THEN when i went to try and put some wheels on i got so lost and confused with the buttons that i swiched back to the keyboard in attempt to install some wheels onto my car turns out the install button is a random numlock key that wont work on my keyboard..

												Some people are sayin' that the controls take some ""getting used to"" and that as soon as you get passed the floaty feel the game is great. Another review says the game is ""a great blend between arcade and simulation"". I can't believe I listened for a single instance. Right out of the box I had to get into the controller xml file just to fix the steering WHICH WAS STILL BAD AFTER THE FIX! That's unacceptable for a racing game. The cars handle like crap and so does the driver AI, they might as well replace the drivers with lock on missiles because screw it, the other drivers are going to hit you just as well as any guided missile a game dev could throw at you.I want to honestly know where the developers got their idea of how a vehicle controls, have they ever driven a vehicle? Do you guys know how a car actually behaves on the track or do you just drive your little Prius to work and used that as your basis for understanding? Controller dead zones shouldn't be set as high as they are either. I shouldn't have to tap the stick continually full tilt just to go around a corner, I should be able to just angle the stick and cruise around it. I doubt they even bothered to tamper with the controls, they were probably too pressed for time by EA and just said ""Screw it, we'll still get a paycheck"".I feel cheated out of my money and if I could get my money back I would but due to the Steam user agreement that I agreed to I can't. I hope the $3.99 I payed during the sale was worth laughing to the bank over. Afterall, it's all about the money, right?			",178,30,15,20,23,0,19

												+ Good-looking (if slightly older) title+ Good selection of cars, if not as exhaustive as Forza and GT.+ Fun career mode- Cheesy VO work by a racer in the career mode, with no option to turn him off.- Unskippable cutscenes instead of a tutorial.- Handling is customizable, but bad on every setting.I just stopped playing this game before writing this review, and unfortunately I can't recommend it due to the steering. It's unresponsive and clunky. What I mean by that is this: you'll be in the middle of a big spoon curve, or coming out of a tight turn, and you wanna stay on that good line by evening out your steering at a spot that sets you up to get where you're looking to be on the track. But the game gets in your way. No matter how lightly you tap the thumbstick, your car will steer heavily in that direction.

												Poor stability. Poor image quality options. Horrendous music. Terrible input lag. Poor Xbox 360 quality textures.The helmet cam is nifty for about three turns, but then becomes super-annoying as you look to the next turn, then the in-game head turns, then you have to shift your gaze back to compensate. What should be ""look, back"" now becomes ""look, shift, back, back"" thanks to the helmet cam getting in the way.The cars have a great feel to them. The tracks are fun to run. You can entirely disable the HUD as is proper.Overall, it is a competent racer. Unfortunately it is also a pretty poor console port of a game that was pretty obviously rushed to market before it's more interesting ideas were fully baked. You'll be far better served looking to Forza 5 or Gran Turismo 6 for your racing needs.On the plus side, there are enough interesting ideas here that I am now curious as to how Slightly Mad's Project CARS will turn out.

			Views: 24,225		

			This issue needs to be fixed. I recorded this with a 60fps camera and counted 12 frames delay. Thats equivalent to ~200 ms of lag, which is terrible. And in the game it feels a lot worse.		

 I cannot explain why is this happening, because game works perfetcly, and first Shift don't have this kind of problems.But, for now it's absolutelly NOT playable.			",168,44,7,45,20,3,37

												What a terrible racing game.. Forces you to place in cockpit mode and forces the camera to move which makes it a bit disorientating for some all of which i can deal with.. The real kicker is when you go to mod your car.. After plugging in my x box controller and finding i had no option to relable any action keys i was guessing what my controller buttons did THEN after finally finding some paint i wanted to select for my car (after several tries) it then told me i wasnt a high enough level to paint my own vehicle in a standard colour.. THEN when i went to try and put some wheels on i got so lost and confused with the buttons that i swiched back to the keyboard in attempt to install some wheels onto my car turns out the install button is a random numlock key that wont work on my keyboard.. From their previous games they had the formula to make it nice and easy but they decided to rework it and make some horrible awkward mechanics.. What a fail..			",106,9,2,14,16,0,6

												Terrible gameplay from the sequal to my (so far) favorite racing game that i have played. Shift 2 has good aspects about it including good customizability and beutiful graphics however it has more downsides. Car choices are not significantly different from shift 1 maybe even worse and the RPM gauge is very slow frame wise. The handling of the cars in this game is terrible, especially coming from an original from shift 1. In conclusion and summary JUST BUY SHIFT 1 THIS ONE ISNT NEARLY AS GOOD.			",122,5,3,19,3,0,14

												+ Good-looking (if slightly older) title+ Good selection of cars, if not as exhaustive as Forza and GT.+ Fun career mode- Cheesy VO work by a racer in the career mode, with no option to turn him off.- Unskippable cutscenes instead of a tutorial.- Handling is customizable, but bad on every setting.I just stopped playing this game before writing this review, and unfortunately I can't recommend it due to the steering. It's unresponsive and clunky. What I mean by that is this: you'll be in the middle of a big spoon curve, or coming out of a tight turn, and you wanna stay on that good line by evening out your steering at a spot that sets you up to get where you're looking to be on the track. But the game gets in your way. No matter how lightly you tap the thumbstick, your car will steer heavily in that direction. This results in out-of-control fishtails if you're aggressive in trying to correct the issue, or a trip into the grass/gravel/wall if you try to let it even itself out. There's very rarely any middle ground, and when I did nail it, it felt like luck, like the binary steering system just so happened to have a ""notch"" that put me where I was trying to go.

												This game is another example of why EA is a terrible game company. They care about nothing more then making their money and cheating out their customers every chance they can get. The game crashes constantly to the point it is un-playable. I sometimes get ""lucky"" enough to play one race before the game crashes on me, other times it will crash before you even get to the main menu. EA has been informed of this thousands of times and have only replied that they have dropped support for this game. Basically they are saying go cry somewhere else we got our money and you can suck it! I bought this game in hopes it would work for me but like so many others who have purchased it i can't get very far without crashing. Don't waste your time or money on this turd of a game.... I know i will never again be purchasing an EA title for me or my children and I will encourage everyone I know to do that same.			",83,3,8,8,17,0,4

												This game, at it's heart, is an amazing racing game.  Lots of cars, generic yet fairly extensive car upgrades, great looking tracks and vehicles, etc.  But unfortunately this game is one of the buggiest games I've bought in a very long time.  Dampening is enabled by default on all controllers, so controls suck real bad unless you edit some config files.  Max graphics settings are missing in the UI, so when I set reflections on ""max"" it says ""_LOW_"" instead, while the rest say ""_HIGH_"".  Using AA of any kind instantly crashes me when I try to join tracks.  And all AA is shader based.  Forcing msaa or ssaa through gfx card options will get you nowhere (except quickly back to desktop after a crash)  You have to uninstall physX and reinstall an old version, just to keep it from crashing constantly.  Spark animation sources never dissapear sometimes, leaving a random continuous shower of sparkles cascading onto the tracks.  Car information doesn't reflect the vehicle at all after certain car upgrades.  Leaves keyboard icons up in UI when using a controller instead of showing you which controller buttons actually manipulate the UI,  ... I'm getting kind of bored writing all these.  And I could very easily keep going.  Do not get this game unless you're prepared to mod the hell out of it and deal with many bugs and crashes.			",106,7,14,19,30,3,28

They cheat in every way, not really well coded, well EA plague i guess, like all negative aspects of this game.Graphics and sound is great though, for me the best NFS title ( - with Shitf 1) since NFS Prosche Unleashed.

This game is impossible to make driveable with the wheel - really wish the refund scheme existed back when I bought it cos it would have gone back.  It is soooo bad that I won't consider buying another EA driving game again.  I could not even drive in a straight line!  The ONLY reason I racked up 4 or 5 hrs is because I tried and tried to get the thing to work as I hated to think I'd done my dough on a dud.			",20,0,9,1,7,0,1

												It would be a great game but unfortunately Shift 2 is riddled with crashes. I'm lucky I can even race while my friend's crashes immediately. If you have an AMD card you MAY be able to play this game. But chances are you'll be unable to play what you want and you will have to play around the crashes, avoiding courses, races and car types. It's sad that this is what NFS has to offer for PC.			",124,15,9,18,23,1,12

												This is a really nice game, it has a very good gameplay, a nice car selection and interesting tunning, allowing you to modify freely various aspects from your car, i am having a really nice time with this, it's way better than Grid 1 and 2, mostly because i don't enjoy the driving style in Grid(It's too much arcade).The only downside i have with this game is the bad optimization for PC, sometimes it randomly crashes, but is not often, on my 8 hours of gameplay it crashed 2 times.

												So, me and my friend bought this game while it was on sale for five bucks, thought It'd be a fun track-racing game, and the reccomendations seemed like it.HOWEVER, Driving is like flinging a bucket of crap around, the engine sounds are horrificly bad and the menu and interface are a pain to work with and look at.This is a definite no for me, and I advice you do NOT buy this game if you are looking for something fun to play with your buddies. Ontop of that, you cannot even skip the cutscenes they give at you, together with the way-too-loud game and different levels of noise for the cutscenes/game itself. 3/10.Atleast the graphics weren't /the worst/.

												This game, at it's heart, is an amazing racing game.  Lots of cars, generic yet fairly extensive car upgrades, great looking tracks and vehicles, etc.  But unfortunately this game is one of the buggiest games I've bought in a very long time.  Dampening is enabled by default on all controllers, so controls suck real bad unless you edit some config files.  Max graphics settings are missing in the UI, so when I set reflections on ""max"" it says ""_LOW_"" instead, while the rest say ""_HIGH_"".  Using AA of any kind instantly crashes me when I try to join tracks.  And all AA is shader based.  Forcing msaa or ssaa through gfx card options will get you nowhere (except quickly back to desktop after a crash)  You have to uninstall physX and reinstall an old version, just to keep it from crashing constantly.  Spark animation sources never dissapear sometimes, leaving a random continuous shower of sparkles cascading onto the tracks.  Car information doesn't reflect the vehicle at all after certain car upgrades.  Leaves keyboard icons up in UI when using a controller instead of showing you which controller buttons actually manipulate the UI,  ... I'm getting kind of bored writing all these.  And I could very easily keep going.  Do not get this game unless you're prepared to mod the hell out of it and deal with many bugs and crashes.			",106,7,14,19,30,3,28

												I wouldnt call it a racing sim but its damn close to one, the cockpit view in this game is probably my all time favorite.You can see your feet moving the pedals, your guy actually using the stick shift and the paddles on the wheel. Graphic wise its AMAZING. The car damage and the visuals on the cars, track and audience are just beautiful. Sound wise it's alright. You can barely hear the car sometimes because the turbo masked it. Every single car that you buy already has a turbo installed in it. What also bugs me is that they also added cars from the 40s and 50s that have ♥♥♥♥ing turbo in it. WTF. Alright another thing that is very important in this game is handling. The car feels like its floating/sliding and can be annoying. In 3rd person the car is literally drifting. Those are the 2 things that really need to be fixed if their is ever going to be a 3rd Shift. Overall: I would buy it and I recommend this game to the casual racer maybe a hardcore racer if they have a wheel7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

[Pros and cons summarised at end]As a huge racing fan, buying almost every game that releases I have to say that SHIFT 2 is among the best of them across the board.Unfortunately, it's Steam page is marred by reviews that start with 'excellent game' before proceeding to not recommend due to the DRM policies and performance issues in the Steam client (This was the last game Electronic Arts released on Steam before Origin came along). I, running a mid-range PC on an i5 and a R9 270 with 12GB RAM, have not noticed these issues so far, the main one being crashes to desktop, rendering unplayable unless placed in Origin (Which can supposedly be achieved with a copy/paste of the CD Key you receive). The second issue people see with this is its DRM policy, the game can only be installed on 5 PC's/across 5 system resets before it can be activated no more. If you are someone who intends to reset or purchase a new PC an additional 4 times whilst playing this game, this could be an issue, mind you EA Support is surprisingly good, last time I had issues installing a game they fixed it and gave me a limited edition upgrade on two occasions, but of course they will migrate you to Origin. When (and if according to these reviews) you get into the game, it is superb. The visuals still hold up incredibly well and the soundtrack within the menus and loading screens is great - composed with the assistance of award-winning composers, one of whom is now doing the Game of Thrones' soundtrack. The gameplay is immensely intense; you know if you hit the driver in front or brake slightly too late it could all be over in a savage first person crash. At most times this game is more of a survival horror than a racing game, it doesn't feature a rewind feature like most sim-racers of the time and instead of casing you as the car, you are actually cast as the driver, something racing games have never really tapped into. This is achieved by the amazing 'helmet cam', taking you not only into 1st person but direct from the driver’s vision. The cockpit blurs under high intensity, the camera shake is perfect and the tilt as you approach a corner really adds the dynamics and intensity, this is also aided by 'motivational' comms messages at the start of races and Vaughn Gittin Jr. who teaches you the basics and introduces you to events, his spotlight of which is drifting, which I have to say is pretty uncontrollable, the general consensus is that the drift events in the career are near impossible. The career overall is very good, you start low end in 'Modern D', D class vehicles such as hatchbacks and work your way up to the FIA GT1 World championship, along the way you are given tasters of what's in store such as time trials or 'hot laps' in Bugatti's and Lambo's which occur about 20% through the game alongside difficult and exhilarating championships and invitationals which can earn you McLaren's and exclusive Team Need for Speed/Speedhunters tuned beasts. Overall the career isn’t the longest and you can probably have it done in under 40 hours, but despite this you still won't have anywhere near enough to buy all the cars which you can still work for through quick events, online and seasonal events.  The cars in this game are very detailed and each have fully rendered interiors *cough* Gran Turismo 5 *cough*, all of them, par a few which are already done up, offer livery choices, including the ability to fully create your own with 100's of stickers which can be placed anywhere on the car, rim options and incredibly open and detailed handling tuning, alongside performance upgrades and body kits for every vehicle. The vehicle range is very varied, especially taking into account that PC players receive the classic Legends and Speedhunters DLC's for free with additional cars and career events. Cars range from classic & retro to hatchback, sport, super, hyper, muscle and open-wheel alongside their respective race versions and tunes from all across the world.Tracks are also very detailed, but you hardly have the time to look at them when your hitting 200mph and there’s a corner 70yds away - the selection is quite large with almost all the major and quite a few minor tracks from around the world present alongside a few fictional ones too. Pros:Car customisationRacing intensity and sense of speed is off the chartsVehicle selectionFree DLC packs for PCTrack rangeVisuals still hold up very wellSoundtrackCareer ProgressionCons:Pro's only apply if you get the game and it worksEA's DRM policyDrift eventsCan get frustratingOverall I would 100% recommend this game, unless you plan on restoring your PC an additional 4 times. Drift events are completely avoidable in the career progression.			",47,2,8,0,3,0,0

Crashy McqueenBack in the days when Shift 1 was out i had it for my Xbox and i really enjoyed it as a racing game back in the day. Later on after i moved to PC gaming and found the Shift 2 for PC i jumped right at it and i was quite pleased for the overal game itself. The game however also comes with the dark and cold truth that it just isint compatible with modern hardware and the game keeps crashing and acting quite weird for most of the part. Graphics: Even when everything is maxed out the game seems to lack a lot in quality (jagged edges and odd visuals) Sound: The audio for this is all over the place. Sometimes audio is too loud or quiet so you have to change it constantly Crashing: The game doesent seem to support Windows 10 wich causes constant crashing.Good Game but too many bugs.

												Really liked this game when I played it on console with friends, I still really enjoy it. Has a really good feel to it, just feels so awesome!Some issues with having this work though! After completion of the first inital career you will probably find that then trying to load any tracks in quick race or level 2 or higher in career your game will just crash.I've researched quite a lot about it and some people reinstall phyx and drivers and it works, others tone down graphics and that worked but for me I had to block the access to SHIFTU2.exe in my firewall. Was the only way I could finally get it to stop crashing! Bummer if you're considering this for online, but I heard there are a bunch of issues with that also but there is a patch fix for it. Google is your best friend.Hope this helps someone. Good game, I reccomend to buy but bit risky if you can't get it to work! Not worth £20 though is only £6 on amazon, get in sale all good :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I started playing Shift 2: Unleashed today. More like ♥♥♥♥ 2: Unstable. This is by far the worst performing NFS title so far. Frame rates can be perfectly smooth (60 FPS) in one race only to fluctuate between 30-60 (NVIDIA v-sync on) in another.It's also pretty messed up that you can't tell whether this game looks better or worse than the first Shift game and there's no music during races. What? At least make that an option. It's like they didn't even bother with this game. So far I'm relatively unimpressed.			",33,3,6,2,3,0,0

												Fabulous racing game. I like the fact that they're producing arcade NFS games now and the more realistic Shift games. I love them both equally, when done right, that is. Ever wanted to play Forza Motorsport or Gran Turismo on the PC ? I'm sorry, you can't, but this one comes pretty close. There isn't a whole lot to tell really, it's sort of a sim. It looks great, it plays great (drifting can be a real challenge though) and above all, it is fun. There is so much stuff to do. But I do wish they will fix the interface for buying vehicles in future titles. At the moment it's kind of a mess. I'm missing all kinds of info.

												Game has no form of support for late model components. I have an AMD FX8350 32gb ripjaw ram, solid state drive with 2 way SLI'd GTX 980's and no matter the graphics configuration or the elimination of SLI i cant get past 40-50FPs. And for me a smooth picture is fairly imortant in a high speed game. I generaly shoot for 90-140fps. Sure i could roll back the Physx drivers everytime i want to play (wich only adds 10-15 depending on the track) then re-update them when i want to play anything else but that kinda adds more work then i look for in a click and play game. Ontop of that the constant crashing is fairly annoying. Seems certain tracks cause a game crash every single time. and again no support. At this point the only reason im even keeping it is since it was gifted. However dont waist your money. With the Forza series making its way to pc, just as soon as they fix the hardware utilization issue it will solve all the needs for this class of racing sim. Dont want to wait, try The Crew, its mor arcade but outside the random server issues it is just as entertaining.			",17,1,5,1,3,0,0

There's a LOT of bugs in the game including things like the game crashing frequently, invisible vinyls and menu issues, not to mention when in career during events, you'll be forced into random races that aren't even part of a tournament, making the completion of a career event take longer than it should. Now we get to the actual gameplay. The voice-over is really cheesy and can get really annoying at times, the vehicles spin out like no tomorrow from simply tapping a wall, another car, or even when from a light bump from behind. Despite the decent graphics and vehicle design, as well as the variety of different tracks available to race on, all the issues with the game pull it down.			",23,3,2,0,5,0,1

												I enjoy racing games and play them almost exclusively. This is the first game I've played that I can't recommend. The game looks great and has some top notch progression but the driving is so flawed the game gets nearly unplayable. At first I thought the input lag was the game trying to force you to drift since the game does have a lot of drift elements to it. And that might be the case but for any race outside of drifting the slow input ruins everything. You have to turn well before you're on the turn and you'll have a hard time correcting if you don't judge correctly. The lag issue is a game killer for me. I'll stick with Race 07 and the other games I have. And for those who read other reviews where people talk about learning the lag and getting through it. Yeah you can do it but I don't want to waste the first 10 hours of game play trying to figure out a flaw in the game.			",9,2,10,1,7,0,1

												The sequel of the masterpiece NFS Shift done right but not perfectOveral (8/10)First of all, this game is racing simulator (you don't say!) so the real time action is needed like handling, brake and throttle to enjoy driving experience as real as possible, Shift 2 is fail to realize that aspect, lag input, a little unaccurate handling like its successor NFS Shift. For what i experience, NFS Shift handling is more good than this one from this aspect. But it doesn't mean it's not fun at all! Really good environment and cars detail, good racing experience and AI, amazing soundtrack make NFS Shift 2 enjoyable. Graphics (8/10)A bit annoying particles and dust on the screen, like no realistic at all, particles is not real time, the cars is like hovering in the dark place with no light source. If you look closely the reflection on the car is not reflected real time on some objects, on certain tracks and conditions. But still this game has a really good environment and cars detail. The graphics overal is top notch!Gameplay (7/10)Like others and its successor, what do you expect from racing simulator games? my personal opinion, Shift 2 Unleashed deliver a good racing experience and AI, not too easy to beat, although theres bad handling and lag input, it is still fun and enjoyable.

												First off, don't be fooled by my low amount of hours here on Steam with this game, I have done 2 playthough's when I owned it on the Xbox360.This is a really good racing game that sits between not a full on arcade racer, but also not a full on sim racer. For me, it is a good balance between the two. I absolutely loved the first Shift and eagerly awaited this sequel. IMO, it did a good job of expanding and improving the many greats about the first one, while still managing to up the ante and introduce some new things. One of the biggest improvements individuals will notice after playing the first one is the way you upgrade the performance of the vehicles. If you've played Forza 3/4, then this type is oh so familiar to you. There is now a much wider range of performance options instead of the tried and true Tier 1, 2, 3 formats. In this you are granted with pretty much any aspect of the car you could think of upgrading and giving them all to you off the bat, the strategy is finding that sweet spot balance of parts to give you the edge, without going over the performance rank (A, B, C, D etc.), which is what races are locked to, or going over your budget.The physics are neither the best, nor as detailed as games like Forza or GT, but the damage and handling models are pretty stellar IMO. As I said previously this is not a full blown Simulation racer. This game is pretty deep as far as modern racers go these days so that’s good and I expect the average person to get a good solid 30+ hours out of just the single player career alone.The AI in this game is quite comical sometimes and makes for some random comical relief. I normally play all my racing games in the highest of difficulty and even on ""Hard"" you will sometimes not too uncommonly see an AI opponent going full throttle in a straightaway and not even brake for the oncoming turn, leaving him careening off the track and slamming into the wall at high speeds leaving an explosion of parts and glass flying everywhere, or slamming into you or another AI opponents read end at full throttle, causing them (or you) to make like a space shuttle into the barricade. Sometime's I think they program to AI to do such nonsense to show off the physics engine haha!However, this is nowhere near a perfect racer by any means and comes with its laundry list of faults that is for sure. Some of the most annoying are: The randomly crazy handling, grazing another driver often leaves you defying the laws of physics, by careening you off the map or putting you into an uncontrollable spin even tapping an opponent in the right spot at relatively slow speeds and at times wired input lag. This also happens just grazing a wall or similar object, which will leaving you scratching your head at how just barely scraping the wall at 40 MPH, sends you into a uncontrollable 1080 degree(3 rotations) spin...Aside from that, the drifting in this game is absolute ♥♥♥♥, no thanks to some of the issues mentioned above and thankfully you can just skip that portion of the game entirely, other than the tutorial you are forced to do. Shift 2 still suffers from the dumbed down money system where after a few levels you have more money then you know what to do with and can max out every car you buy with ease, this kills some of the ""I worked for this"" feeling, or struggling to get that next little upgrade to give you more of an edge. Shift 2 no longer has that ""Obviously best car in the class"" problem that was in the first Shift where there was that one car that was leaps and bounds better than the rest of the cars in that class as far as performance went. With the addition of a horde of new cars, quantity of cars and classes and the Performance Index system, there is now a whole new level of strategy in picking and choosing the best cars and parts to suit your gameplay, while still staying in the Performance Index rating.In the end this is a decent console port with everything else being truly satisfying. Good deep racing scene with multiple disciplines, sometimes seemingly endless amounts of races, character leveling system, good customization esp. for performance parts and The graphics which I know most put a lot of emphasis on are decent, not as good as say Grid 2 etc., but still good eye candy in Ultra settings. 8/10			",82,4,11,24,13,0,11

												I enjoy racing games and play them almost exclusively. This is the first game I've played that I can't recommend. The game looks great and has some top notch progression but the driving is so flawed the game gets nearly unplayable. At first I thought the input lag was the game trying to force you to drift since the game does have a lot of drift elements to it. And that might be the case but for any race outside of drifting the slow input ruins everything. You have to turn well before you're on the turn and you'll have a hard time correcting if you don't judge correctly. The lag issue is a game killer for me. I'll stick with Race 07 and the other games I have. And for those who read other reviews where people talk about learning the lag and getting through it. Yeah you can do it but I don't want to waste the first 10 hours of game play trying to figure out a flaw in the game.			",9,2,10,1,7,0,1

												This game is bad, really bad. I've played a lot of different racing simulators and this is one of the worst.Some of the problems I've had:     -  The UI is terrible and confusing.     -  The controls are non-responsive and feels like jelly     -  The AA doesn't work, meaning that you will always have jagged cars     -  You will lose control of your car a alot, and for no apparent reason     -  There's no traction, it's almost like you're driving on sand, constantly     -  The game assumes that you're an idiot, and there is no way to skip the parts where they tell you that you need to use the gas to accelerate the car. This doesn't happen just once but for every single new type of race you'll try.     -  There's an extreamly tedious and obnoxious guy who tells you how awsome he is and then explains to you what a muscle car is, like if you never seen one before. And you can't skip this either.     -  Because this is published by EA you'll get all that stuff to, bugs, annoying online system, tutorials that never end, PEGI 3, etc.Does it seem like I'm exaggerating? Well I don't. If you do not trust me, go ahead and spend your 20 euro on this junk.Take my advice and spend your hard earned money on something that actually will give you entertainment, and not more problems.

												I wouldn't recommend this even if it was cheap (and I did get it cheap).  the force feedback is a joke, and the handling is terrible.  I've tried many times over the years to try to play this and the first shift, but I just can't wrap my head around the physics they use.  I'm more accustomed to Forza, Race 07 - pretty much any of the simbin titles and the formula 1 & Dirt series from codemasters.   In addition, the Fanatec CSR wheel is not supported natively and the menus can be a total nightmare to navigate with just the keyboard because it doesn't support the controller in the menus (press I or U to go through each option screen and J or K for advanced... Seriously!?). No running a steam box connected to the TV sans keyboard or mouse with this game.			",101,66,30,11,5,2,14

												I played Shift 1 and instantly fell in love with the game - I couldn't wait to get shift two... especially when the price dropped :)! I would say out of all racing games there are and even compared to Grid : Autosport, I have to give the cake to Need For Speed Shift 2 on this one. Just an absolutely beautiful racing game. Very enjoyable to drive, drift, turn, race, crash, and cutting off other drivers to take the lead. The visuals are stunning. Seriously, what else do you want from an automotive game? This is 2014, we're all expecting decent graphics by now.The game play more importantly is what makes this game stand out from other racers. Sure this isn't the classic NFS where you run from police, but this NFS is more simulation based and can make your heart skip when taking a turn. There are suggestive arrows on the track to tell you how fast to take a turn, however they are suggestions may I remind my reader. They change accordingly to your speed but I feel once you get the hang of how a car handles you don't quite need to rely on them heavily. The tracks are a perfect length and I haven't run into any races that I've dreaded (meaning those races that you have to race for 10-15 minutes at a time). Tracks are also nice, challenging, fun, and some turns just really get you into the game. I've never been a gamer to turn my controller for racing (or any games for that matter) and this was the first game where I felt that displacing my controller may do something (it doesn't but that's how immersed I can get playing). The small drift and loss of wheel control when taking major turns is impeccable. If you do over do a turn and end up hitting the wall, your screen goes hazy and gray to simulate impact. This I do not find annoying but rather amusing and realistic. Damage to your car is also pretty spot on. RATING : 8.3/10Gameplay B+ Story / Campaign A Visuals / User Interface B+ Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B- Overall  B+This game get's a solid 8.3/10. Why the extra .3 over my solid rating of 8? The game modes, the UI, just how it was all put together just makes it so nice.			",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

In addition, Ai seems to always have a lighter car - even when they are ""identical"".Oh, yeah. You can't skip the intro that lasts ~15 sec for every single race. Even when you had to restart said race due to Ai slamming you into a wall.Would not recommend for anyone that must use a keyboard.Only good thing are the graphics, and those get stale.

												I had been playing for 7-8 hours, was level 13 when my game crashed during a loading screen.When I came back, I had to redo the initial tutorial races, and then the menu finally showed. Now, I still have my money and cars, but my career has effectively been reset BUT my levels haven't. And so it is now impossible to unlock what was previously unlocked and I can only do the first 8-9 races. I tried levelling up once, but it still unlocked absolutely nothing. This is a known glitch, it seems to have been around for years as I've seen lots of complaint about it online. Worst is, there is apparently NO FIX unless you somehow have a backup of your game save to before the incident. I have stupid Windows 8 that apparently turns off backuping by default so I'm boned there. P.S as a reference, it is this exact glitch :

												I must admit to being rather disappointed by this game when i first bought it, so left it gathering dust for quite a while afterwards. However, after enjoying the original NFS: Shift for the umpteenth time i decided to give this another try... and i'm glad i did.In many ways this is more of the same, only with a new, rather cluttered layout and inferior graphics (sadly). There are more cars (a LOT more) to choose from, more circuits, more events... and i'm pleased to say the engine sounds are every bit as good as they were in the original. But one of the changes didn't agree with me. I really don't like the default helmet cam view, and i can see it being off-putting to a number of people, so changing it back to the same cockpit view as used in the first NFS: Shift game was essential. The other major change is one that initially i didn't like, but now i'm finding it great...Upgrading your car is no longer as simple as it was in Shift. Now as your car is upgraded, it's performance rating increases, and as it increases it is possible that it is no longer eligible for the class that you are still racing in. I'll use my current car as an example. The Audi R8 is a Class C car with a performance rating of 920. If that rating reaches 1000 or more, it becomes a Class B car, and can no longer be used in Class C events. This means you have to be careful when choosing your upgrades, do you go for top speed, acceleration, or handling... or only a slight improvement in all 3? This means you have to think about your upgrades carefully. Thankfully you can sell all upgrades (and purchased cars) back for the same price you bought them, so if the upgrades you've chosen aren't working out for you, get rid of them and try experimenting with different ones. This means it's no longer as simple as just slapping on every single upgrade for your car as soon as you can afford them... chances are you can afford far more upgrades than you can actually fit while remaining in your racing category. This also has the benefit of being able to keep your favourite Class C car, but giving it the performance to genuinely compete in Class B, maybe even Class A, races.The pure racing arcade game is no longer quite as mindless as the first Shift game... and i personally think that makes this a great game that is well worth buying.

												This is a tough game to properlly review, so please take the thumbs up with a grain of salt at the moment. On its own, the game has a host of unique features and problems as compared to its competitors (especially of those on the consoles.) Then compared to the original Shift game, it also made some improvements but cut where it shouldn't have.But let's start with the basics. This is a simulator racing game. Or at least, that is what it is classified as. If you are wanting an open world experience with pursuits, save yourself the heartache and look at just about any other Need for Speed title because this game has none of that. This is a game that tries to create professional races with opponents that are about evenly matched with you as possible.So how does it do to that? Well, again, it comes in with a mixed bag. No, I can't honestly say that this is the most accurate game possible, but it isn't going to let you off with bad driving. In true Need for Speed fashion, the car list feels rather small and this time around we have a lot of repeating cars. Customization is a bit hit or miss as while we finally have engine swapping with the more specific engine parts to upgrade (not to the point of realism though,) there is still a linear upgrade in body kits and the vinyl designing seems to be even worse. At the very least, all cars can be upgraded with Works. Thankfully, tuning can be either simplified or extremely technical while also allow saving different settings for a given car for each track. Yep, you can have a special setting for the short, technical track and a different one for those at higher speeds and the game will automatically switch out based off the track and layout.The gameplay is where the game begins to shine over others though. Traffic is actually a thing as smashing your way through opponents is a bad idea over trying to (almost) safely weave through them. Night racing is absolutely wonderful and I have yet to find another racing game that tops it as while well lit tracks don't bring much issue, unlit tracks like the Nürburgring become a lot more difficult (and almost scary) to drive with not always being able to see around the corner. AI can also be fairly aggressive but not to the point of cheating or actually being unsportsman. If you play with the camera on dask or on helmet, the race feels more intense as it bobbles around like you are in the car itself, making even a quick run around a track by yourself in a low end car feel more intense than others with AI drivers with high end vehicles.The helmet cam is also a new feature to this game (that will probably leave due to things like the occulus rift.) The camera will look into the turn like a professional driver. While it takes some getting use to at first, it is well executed and does end up becoming quite helpful especially in larger vehicles but probably not needed for triple monitors.All of that said, Shift 2 is a fairly good place for people to try and break into the simulator genre. The game has a level system based on what you do and mini-achievments per race, meaning that just because you have a hard time winning doesn't mean you can't progress to the end. While different from the previous Shift title, it still does the job well at letting new players still get a chance to eventually move on but without being a hinderance to veterans of the genre.Now, how about against the original Shift? Well, more improvements and new issues. Yes, night time racing is a wonderful feature, helmet camera is appreciated, and the improved graphics are wonderful. But they have removed the unnamed crew chief who started the race for you with a real world professional driver. And yes, you will know that the new person helping you is a professional driver. And yes, it becomes a nusiance. No, Shift 2's new guy doesn't have an annoying voice but that it feels like he is lecturing you for every single race instead of seeming like you are part of the same team. We go from a grassroot driver becoming a legend to a grassroot driver who is forever in the shadow of his teacher. And then they brought in the rest of the real world drivers. Yep, every boss race is you against a real world racer betting their car against you. No weakness and they are not that interesting especially when almost all of them are driving a car sponsored by EA. I get that they might be trying to create buzz for the drivers, but this isn't a good way to get me excited for them.Allow me to wrap this up. Wanting a typical Need for Speed game? I recommend Hot Pursuit by Criterion. Want a super realistic simulator? Might be worth your time. Just want a fun yet fairly challenging racing game? This is probably up your alley. Looking for the proper sequel to Shift? Prepare for disappointments and be pleasantly surprised at certain points.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Shift 2: Unleashed is as good as Need for Speed: Shift was bad. Bold statement as Shift 1 was widely praised for splitting the franchise and moving into the racing sim genre, breaking away from Need for Speed’s arcade roots. But it wasn’t quite there. Shift 1 was a prototype for the formula, testing what worked and what didn’t. What definitely didn’t work were the physics and handling. Floaty, unresponsive and still clinging to the series traits. An EA inclusion more than Slightly Mad Studios, as the UK developers were definitely capable of more precise and realistic handling based on their earlier GTR games. However, the cockpit view was an absolute blessing and Shift 2: Unleashed drastically improves the handling to match the visually stunning cockpit view.GameplayShift 2’s cockpit view is the best and most visceral experience I’ve ever seen in a racing game. Not only is it highly accurate and detailed, the cockpit also features amazing effects. Wing mirrors shake at high speeds, vision is blurred at those speeds, the dashboard is reflected on the windscreen, shifting, handbrake and pedal actions are all intricately animated, dirt flicks on to the windscreen, rubber and gravel ‘marbles’ hit the undercarriage and wheel arches and high speed crashes cause violent shaking, temporary loss of vision and heavy breathing from the driver. Also the option to have a helmet camera further emphasises the impact as well as the precision as the head sways towards the corner direction for added realism. The third person camera offers the chance to view the detailed cars from behind but it doesn’t offer the connection the player has with the car as the camera is a bit too floaty, I like that word, making it hard to aim for the apexes. Luckily, the improvements in handling have made it much easier to point a car at an apex. Turning off all assists, except ABS and Automatic (c’mon now), produces the most rewarding driving experience in a racing game. Throttle control is vital as well as judging the braking zone and corner angle all to get the best exit creating intense racing. Immersion can be broken however by the slightly over-aggressive AI drivers who have no problem PIT manoeuvring you off the track or blocking you on straights. A little more Jenson and little less Pastor would’ve made a less frustrating battle for 1st. This is tied to the fact that Unleashed doesn’t have a rewind feature made popular by Codemasters and now prominent in the Forza series. Thank God though, as racing intensifies in the latter stages making it a white knuckle ride to the finish line without a safety net.Career progression is improved above and beyond Shift 1’s silly star system as well as the XP rewards being based on good driving rather than awarding careless racing. Videos by real-life racers and drifters such as Vaughn Gittin Jr. introduce each racing category and you are provided the opportunity to learn and hone the skills before heading out on track. Need for Speed fans are also given extra cash and cars for their dedication to the franchise, which helps save up cash to buy their dream cars. Unlike Shift 1, to race a car in Hot Lap mode, you have to buy the car in career mode. Perhaps unfair, but it gives a real incentive to finish gold in every race and manage the cash in order to afford the cars you really want. Helpfully, cars can be sold for the price bought making it easy to sell the lower-powered sports cars necessary for a category in order to save for a hypercar. The car list is smaller than GT5 or Forza 4, but it ignores the unnecessary hatchbacks and endless Nissans of the GT series. The cars here are focussed racing machines and monstrous production cars all with beautifully detailed interiors and exteriors with moving airbrakes and wings. Not included are any Ferraris but the Porsche selection more than makes up for it. The diverse variety of tracks features all the greats such as Suzaka, Silverstone and Spa as well as an interpretation of the Monaco GP circuit. TechnicalThe sounds are loud. My headphone volume was at 50% most of the time and sometimes lower at night. The cars sound great though and the noticeable differences in sound from the cockpit view to behind the exhaust demonstrate the attention to detail that Slightly Mad paid. The graphics are impressive not just the cars but also the track surroundings, including helicopters and planes flying over whilst racing. Night racing is also a welcome addition with tactics having to alter and slight apprehensiveness when approaching blind bends. The ability to turn off HUD whilst in-game is also a brilliant addition as you can have the lap times and positions when you need them and turn them off to not obscure the view without breaking the flow of the race.  The framerate could be improved though as modding was the only way to uncap the 30fps limit.VerdictTurn off assists. Stick it in cockpit view and go RACE.90%			",140,9,5,4,2,0,2

												I played most NFS games from the PSX area to nowadays. I actually thought this would be like NFS: Pro Street (a sort of Gran Turismo-like NFS if you haven't played it) but according to the dev, it was the most sim-like NFS.I'll start by saying that the game feels overall empty: Nearly never music (I could live with that), poor amount of cars (I could forgive that), but a very horrible driving sensation.For a game that is labeled as a realstic game, I was both shocked and dead laughing when a message asking me to plug a controller poped when I was trying to play the drift mode with my steering wheel. Like, really? A sim car that ask you to unplug a steering wheel to plug a gamepad?Now it's not as if the normal races where better. You feel like your car behave like nothing you've ever driven: the steering lack of precision and is the most ""floaty""steering I've ever seen in a racing game, not like the overall behaviour of the car was salvaging anything as every car seems to understeer as if you were driving a 18 tons truck, to the exception of when the game actually decides that it's time to make you feel like you oversteer. There's really not a single positive thing I can say about that game. Even at €1.00 I think it would be a waste.			",194,15,6,32,9,0,20

												Beforehand, I played this game for about 40 hours before buying the steam version on a sale. SHIFT 2 is not an accurate racing sim by any means, but it gets pretty close, and offers a ton of turn on-off features to make the driving easier or more difficult on you. Of special note are the brake and steering assist - which always get me all mixed up in because I can´t tell what I do and what the computer does, and sometimes the assist does some really awkward stuff. So I turned that stuff off very quick. I´ve played on keyboard extensively, it has this weird steering delay worked in and it obviously can´t tell the difference between `steer right a bit´ and `steer right´. This makes controlling high performance cars impossible, and on high driving difficulties the only cars I got to steer somewhat decently was low performance stuff with a heavy focus on steering. You just cannot handle the oversteer (and wheelspin)virtually any car throws at you with a keyboard. The keyboard also starts out with really weird key settings and I recommend changing them to something more sensible ASAP (menuing also uses weird as hell keys)So I bought an XBOX 360 controller. And the controls suddenly worked like a charm. Seriously, if you´re going to play this game, having at least a controller is a must. Something that´s very important to mention, I think, is that SHIFT 2 is horrendously unstable. I get random crashes, and the game simply always crashes to desktop on certain races, and tracks. It´s appalling, and in my opinion enough reason to not buy this game at all. Which is a waste, it´s a fun game if it doesn´t crash to desktop more often than your mother.			",34,0,2,5,1,0,5

												As far as I'm concerned, this is a very poorly done console port. The keyboard keys are bound to impossible keys, in game mechanics aren't optimized to PC, and the AI is poorly done, not to mention the fact that the game crashes often on high graphics.Before diving into issues, i want to dive into a major issue with this game: The long, unskippable in-game movies that can't decide which volume they want to be. For starters there's the intro movie, that gets incredibly loud, and is only skippable after all the logo's displayed. These don't read into your personal volume preferences though, and are extremely loud, which is especially annoying when you play with a headset. Then, there's introduction videos that introduce you into a certain ""event"". These can be cool, but you need to be able to skip them. If you're hyped up for a race beforehand, a 2 minute long movie can only get you out of that hype. The fact that you actually have to delete the movies out of your data map, is a ridiculous thing in it's own. Now that that's out of the way, on to my major flaws with this game.My first issue with this game is the horrible standard controls that the game asks you to use. This would be with the arrow keys, and the insert / delete button to shift gears. And yes, you use the up arrow for throttle. A controller of sorts makes the game easier to handle, even though this also isn't perfect. You can control in-game fully with a controller, but as soon as you enter any menu, including the pause menu, you are forced to use the keyboard. Especially when in-game this is a very poor point, given that you have to sit ready with your controller already in your hand, before pressing either the enter or escape button on your keyboard.My second problem lays in the fact that a lot of the in game mechanics aren't optomized for pc. Left and right scrolling through the main menu goes with the arrow keys, while sub menu's always go with either U and I, or J and K, depending on what you want to do. The customization mechanic is sensitive beyond believe, and isn't, like most of the game, controllable with a controller, making it virtually impossible to line stickers up. Most of the engine / steering upgrades are standard, and it is clear that EA has it's favorite cars that are being favored. Some of the works cars (which are supposed to be the maxed out performance cars) are so horrible, that it's impossible to control on a circuit. Finally, the poor AI. I find myself having to reset the track about 15 to 20 times, especially at the beginning,  to be even able to race in a fair matter. More often then wished, i find way too many cars bumping in on me, and spinning me out of control, making it impossible to even have a fair chance at winning. When I instead try to do the same, the cars seem to be magnetized to the track, and are unable to even get off. It's like bumping into an almost static object, sending you spinning, or even flipping out of control, but AI driven cars are completely fine. The most that the AI will do for you, is try and steer about half a meter clear from you, so that you can try and clear a corner. But more often then not, they still bump into your back and send you spinning. That being said, I don't think the game is entirely just bad things. There are some positives, the cars generally look awesome, and there is some fun to be had in multiplayer, or attempting to break the AI in a race. If you are successful, it's definitely worth the effort, and you could get some laughs out of that. I wouldn't say the game is worth the full 20 euro's that are currently charged, but wait until it's on sale sometime. 5 Euro's is about what the game is worth, in my opinion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The second and probably last Shift game to come by Slightly Mad Studios.It is very similar to Shift but also very different.Graphics/PerformanceThe graphics on Shift where great for a 2009 game and the same follows for Shift 2. They are similar but slightly better compared to Shift especially on the vinyle quallity. The surroundings on the track are not the greatest but it is hard to notice when you are gunning it down the track at 180 MPH. The car detail is very nice and the paints look very pretty. For me at least the game runs fine but every once in a while when starting a race it gets ♥♥♥♥ing slow for a few moments and goes back to normal. Other than that it performs great on my PC. I'd give it a 9/10 on graphics/performance for a game from 2011.GameplayWell for one the gameplay is totally different from Shift. They took the realisim up a notch on the way cars feel and handle compared to Shift. Drifting has also been made way different compared to Shift and is actually quite hard for most people. Overall the game is probably 2 times as hard as Shift was. The customizing like in Shift sucks just the same with no paintable wheels and hardly any vinyles to apply thus making it impossible to make your own liveries. This makes me feel forced to use the pre made liveries that look bad IMHO which leads me to just paint my cars metallic blue and be done with it. The vinyling system was definatly improved since Shift but they removed a great number of vinyles and made 90% of them only one colour. The AI can be annoying at times especially on small, tight tracks as they will push you out of their way in a hairpin making it almost impossible to win. I'd give gameplay a 8/10 only because of the crappy vinyling system.OverallOverall this game is fun and challenging making it very entertaining for me. Nothing beats blasting around the Nordschleife in a 1986 Toyota Corolla AE86 with over 800 HP. If you like racing simulators, buy it. If you like cars, buy it. If you like drifitng, buy it.

												Its good but its god awful at the same time. I want to enjoy but theres so much wrong with it, and just like every other EA game it has a couple fatal flaws in it that just RUIN the gameplay. The NEGATIVES are that the steering has this huge input delay that becomes more relevant the more you play, as you will try to steer only to not steer hard enough or way to hard and just send yourself swerving off the track. The game is also really hard, that and im bad at it, on top of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls. The ai just seems like if you aren't in first place at the very beginning, you wont be able to pass the ai in first. Not to mention all the other racers can just ram you ar send you off the track and wreck your car and send you to last place like your a ♥♥♥♥ing ragdoll. Then when you try to ram them you might as well be trying to move mountains. Oh and i should mention another thing...THIS PART IS IMPORTANT IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING THIS GAME. I had frequent problems of it crashing because of...well i never even found out what but i tried fixing it for 2 hours and the damn thing still occaisionally crashes, which just turns me off of this game especially after all the other things i mentioned.BUT WAIT. THERE ARE SOME POSITIVES.Ok so i know ive beaten on this game quite a bit but there are SOME positives. Compared to shift 1, this game has alot more cars and makes the car list from the first one look pretty dismal. The cars and customization are also pretty cool and cool to drive (well...apart from the steering as i mentioned earlier) and the sounds and graphics are also pretty awesome. But i find when i crank my graphics to the max the game crashes (weird) Idk if this is because im using amd radeon r9 270 and this game is made on all that nvidia bull ♥♥♥♥.besides it being fustrating AF to play, some of it is pretty cool, but i cant exactly recommend it because alot of people would feel as though their money was wasted. But if its really cheap or comes in a racing pack (which is how i aquired it) then its not SO bad. But if you want to play a shift game maybe you should play shift 1 instead(?) or at least first because this one definetly takes some getting used to. CONCLUSIONWell i know i ratted on this game alot but its partly because im frustrated. Its honestly not THAT bad, like there are worse racing games you could play (that you could buy on steam) I guess its worth a play, at a cheap price, i only ""dont recommend"" this game simply because of what i mentioned above and because some people might not be able to get past its plaws, which i can understand because were all different, but at the same time others probably can. If i had to rate this game it'd get 6/10 or so.if you managed to read this far or all of my review then thank you, and also congratulations, thats a pretty wordy and boring review. i just hope it helped out			",113,4,6,2,8,0,3

												Honestly the game is fun for maybe 15 minutes at a time. After that you remember that it is another EA floater that someone forgot to flush down the toilet.PROSGreat visuals (tracks, cars, and even cockpit interiors all look good)Very customizable cars with advanced tuning features brought back from some older NFS titlesVehicle damage is great and somewhat realistic (but sadly no total carnage from a serious crash)CONSThe ""pep talks"" from Vaughn Gittin before and after the races make me want to jam a sharp instrument into each of my ears. I appreciate that he's a drift champion, but listening to his drole, useless commentary over and over makes me wish he was never born.There is a significant and noticable delay in the handling for all the controllers and wheels that I tested with this game. You basically have to turn early to compensate for this painful delay or you will end up in a wall on every corner.The interface, like so many other EA titles, is a Frankenstein's monster patchwork glued together from console versions. As a result, the menu navigations are nonsensical and tedious. As an example of this: you cannot adjust controls and sensitivities during a paused race; instead you must exit the race, go all the way back to the first menu, change the controls, then start the race over again.The EA autolog is forced down your throat and completely useless. It slows down load times and will often cause the game to hang indefinitely during a track load if you do not block it with a firewall.The AI, if you can even call it that, will often mistake the race track for a demolition derby. They will slam into you when you slow for corners, clip your tail and spin you out, and all sorts of other shennanigans unrelated to racing and with no fear of disqualification. Likewise, you can slam into them and generally wreak havoc without any fear of disqualification, so go nuts! My favorite is when two AI side-swipe each other in the first corner and then slow to a stop as they both try to turn into one another.The intro sequence for each race always seems to have frame stutter and audio clipping regardless of video detail settings. But then the races go by without any frame issues on high details. ",12,2,2,2,1,0,0

												Believe me when I say that I'm giving out this warning with a heavy heart: Stay away from this game.The TAGES DRM is absolutely unbearable and WILL make your game unplayable after a handful of reinstalls.Besides that, though, the game was excellent when it came out. One of the finest simcade racers of its era, and it's the precursor to the incredible Project CARS (by the same devs and a massively enhanced version of the same engine).Thing is, today you have Project CARS, which severely outclasses this in basically every single aspect. That fact along with this game's offensive, almost unbelievably bad DRM means this is better left as a historical milestone towards the creation of Project CARS and little else.			",62,3,9,8,2,0,5

												The controlling and handling is very poor. I know its similar to F1 games. But once you get the right speed momentum. You then have to slow down again at a sharp tight corner turn. And if you aimed at top speed. Your most likely to race off the track. This is a Need For Speed game! The game should at least have a handbrake implemented so you can drift around corners like how Need For Speed Shift first game had and Prostreet. This one is just not balanced!			",80,60,8,7,13,1,7

												After all this time.. I've given up.. Between the graphic glitches, bad animation like shifting a manual with teleporting arm that reset every shift, to having to repair the game every month to even keep it stable... Sound is.. Good on some cars, generic on others. Graphics, minor glitches here and there... Grass on Nordshliefe is really buggy for me, as well as the text/markings on the track which floats about half a meter of the track. Dunno exactly when it crashes.. But it does. Menus glitch up after a while.. Low/some sounds seem to cut of for me when I set Audi setting to low. AI think GT3 races are American Demilition derbies.  Drag racing seems to have a bug where you can't change views or even look around after the first run. Controls are just bad. But It has the Nurburgring and Enna Pergusa etc. so I've played those fanatically. But enough is enough. It's mostly a waste of space unless you are REALLY bored. ",65,1,3,11,4,0,2

												Shift 2 Unleashed was a solid racing game and the first one I've played to completion on career mode of 100%.  While I would recommend this game, I do so with some caveats, which I will list in the cons.  The most important point people need to know is that controls have to be customized heavily, I used an Xbox 360 controller for windows and the stock settings were awful, however I followed some guides online and tweaked a couple ini files and was good to go.  Here is the guide that was helpful for me setting up controls: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2270539Pros: - Lots of races- Good variety of cars- Most cars look great and have great interiors- AI makes mistakes on occasion, even knocking themselves out of the race- AI will bump into you more if you start driving dirty- Difficulty Levels and driving assists really let you tailor this into either a sim racer or arcade, I like it closer to sim but not all the way there and played with no damage, driving assist line, medium AI, elite handling mode and all driving assists turned off.Cons:- Crashes (not the kind you'd expect, in my 75+ hours I've probably had about 30 crashes to desktop, sometimes losing progress, particularly maddening on endurance races).- Ignored/Lost progress bug.  I noticed this when doing the last drag races, often times the race results screen would show up twice and I would lose all my progress and have to repeat the series, very annoying but after 3 tries on each of the last standing mile races I was able to get through.- Challenges like the modern A invitational can be difficult because you are provided with a car and not able to tune it for the track (makes for a frustrating experience at times).- ""Cut the track"" bugs.  Perhaps I'm misinformed but on a few tracks if you go too wide on a turn (understeer) into the grass and then come back to the same turn it would say ""you've cut the track!"".  I call BS on that, I thought cutting the track was when you took a shortcut through a turn on the inside grass, not the outside.  This was infuriating on one particular track where following the ideal race line would put you into this situation on purpose, even with just two wheels off.- Other general bugs, none of the ""videos"" unlocked even though I completed the career stuff for them.- Not enough levels, Max level in game is 20, after that you keep earning experience but it goes nowhere.  I hit level 20 by 45% career completion.  Why build levels in at all when they end that soon?All in all, this was a fun experience and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a racer that helps bridge the gap between simulation and arcade.  8 / 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												6/10Do I recommend this game? Yes & No. If you want awesome semi simulation racing on single player, with loads of customization, and the option to sell cars for the full cost; then this is a game that can give you that.Do you want to play online with friends, have online 24 hour races, and show of your rides online? Then you cannot. Yes this game has multiplayer but steam simply does not work online. If you are lucky enough to play online the Origin player cars will fly around like tornadoes through the air.

Ive been contacting ea for 2 weeks and still getting the run around with drivers and uninstall and reainstall then they made me download thier client and said that would fix the problem.  Still doesnt work been doing countless steps to fix from them its doing the exact same thing.  I believe that a game should work on a pc expecially nowadays.  I tried to get refund from steam they said no because i went 20 min over my 2 hour time limit while trying to fix and because i bought this game a while back but never installed it.  I say no to this and ea's support system and steams supports system need work big time.   So yeah ea you are proving me wrong everyday.			",210,12,5,11,8,2,11

This game basically can be incredibly boring and annoying to those people who are not really enthusiastic about cars.

I want a husband that makes six figures, and offers five of them to me, so I can take care of my needs. A man who does not speak too much, just opens his wallet. I want the good life, because I deserve a good life, because I am a woman of privilege. When I grow up, I want to be a man who does nothing all day but mule over the shortcomings of society.

												Lack of flashbacks is fairly irritating, especially since the AI is way to agressive and knocks you off the track every chance they get which is extra fun at the end of a 3 lap race on the Nurbergring.  Some cars have glassy handling making them completely undrivable, this wouldnt be so bad if some of the challenges didn't require you to use these cars.  I enjoyed the first NFS:Shift more than this one.The announcer is unnecessarily irritating.  Also, I dont need to see a unskippable cutscene of the car im driving before every race.There is a bug that even after closing the game Steam continues to think the game is still active.  I have to force close Steam before I can launch another game.  I've racked up 200+ hours of time while this game has not actually been active.The only thing good about this game is driving the Pagani Zonda R around the Nurbergring. However, it takes way too long to earn the money to buy it.I will be more than happy to permanently retire this game when Project CARS comes out.			",137,16,12,7,16,0,30

												I recommend AGAINST getting this game. Force feedback is numb, and the upgrade system only includes go-fast bits instead of handling goodies (unless I just didn't earn enough levels to unlock them in my brief time with the game). All of the handling and braking seems to be handled with settings that are not unlocked when you first get started. There is no tire selection. There is a nitrous button. This game has elements of a good racing game, but misses hugely in too many places, numb feedback probably being the worst of it all, as it makes driving difficult.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After purchasing this game when it was on sale and considered other need for speed games are controller optimized, I got hold of an Xbox controller too for some asda car park style racing fun. Having spent over 4 hours to at least attempt to be half decent in any series of races (wouldn't even dream of calling drift racing) I failed miserably. Alas i did not give up and leave the game alone, I purchased a proper racing wheel, shifter and pedals only to find that it didn't not work well with a new wheel setup. Playing something like asseto corsa to this, this horrendous piece of excrement, they simply should have spent money on something worth while like sacking all of the useless idiots they employed to create this. Also kudos to steam for not refunding anyone after 2 hours of play, really...bravo! As always why do we need some racing driver from the states claiming he knows racing because he can 'drift'. Could have had more fun playing call of duty with a racing wheel than this, shouldn't have bothered.

												Let me just start by saying that I am in no means one of those sheep that praise EA in all they do and will pay them hundreds maybe even thousands of $s, £s or €s on on-disc DLC and pointless crap for Origin, thankfully the pointless DLC for this game comes with the game, so no need to worry about it there. Though I can guarantee that you most likely won't give a ♥♥♥♥ about a DLC that gives you a load of crappy, boring-looking cars that aren't half as good as the ones you can create yourself.Honestly, this is a game that CAN be enjoyable, even though the bads outweigh the goods, for example:BADS:1. The main menu isn't even compatible with a controller2. The custom livery mechanic is so poorly done, there's only 300 decals with 250 of them being sponsors, you can't even put numbers on your car. You can't line up your stickers, the resolution of said stickers is poor, and when you edit a sticker, your cursor wont move until you come out of the customization and back in.3. If you don't want to use a controller, the default keys are horrible e.g. Insert and Delete being your gear shifting...4. If you ever get bored and just want to ♥♥♥♥ around with an AI, it's difficult to get them off the track unless you literally butt♥♥♥♥ them at 250mph while they're coming to a stop due to EA's amazing magnetizing to the racing line.5. The AI will just about avoid you if you come to a complete stop, they won't give a single ♥♥♥♥ about you going at a high speed, it's okay for them to bump into you because they're magnetic to the road.6. Unskippable intros to different style races, and don't forget that you MUST see the big ""EA we're the best at taking your money"" logo at the beginning.7. Most of the cars you can spend over 300k on to turn into a ""works"" car, some will actually be so bad that they stall between each gear, you cannot fix this and won't see it happen until you enter a test or track...which doing so will reduce the value of the car so you won't even get your full amount of money back.8. The main menu car lot won't show all the cars you can buy in the game, you have to go into the career mode and look into the specific style events, like for muscle and classic cars.9. If your PC is like mine, then the game will simply refuse to run if you're running in maxed out, it'll just crash when you enter a race, by no means is this a fault with my PC, I've ran much more demanding things than a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (now last gen) console port.GOODS:1. Decent selection of cars2. Tuning actually does stuff in this game, HALLELUJAH3. It looks pretty nice for a console port4. The soundtrack is pretty decent (despite the fact the songs don't change until after you do a race).5. It had night time races...So if you managed or could be bothered to get this far:So overall, if you're thinking ""Why the ♥♥♥♥ did you buy the game if you think it's so damn bad?!"" it's because I actually enjoyed the first NFS Shift game, it was pretty nice and kinda cool to ♥♥♥♥ around on, and I suppose it's my fault for not looking into it before buying it. However, despite how ♥♥♥♥ I think it is, it has something about it that keeps me playing it, but only with friends. It's by far not the best racing sim out there, but it's not quite arcade. Do I think it's worth the full price? ♥♥♥♥ NO. Yet, if you manage to see it on discount and it's a game you want, I say go for it if you like racing games that don't give you the feeling of driving a real car, or if you just like a decent challenge because of EA's infamous false-difficulty AI.I'm kinda 50/50 on this game...Damn console ports.Above all else; If you DO get this game, just don't turn the Comaro into a works car...unless you feel like brainwashing yourself with stalling gear change sounds and torturing yourself with a slippy as ♥♥♥♥ car.

												This successor for NFS Shift (1) keeps on the sim feel, while having forgiving gameplay. I like the physics in the corners, with the weight shifting when you hit the brakes/gas. Fun for a while, but here are some issues that kept me from enjoying the game:I have issues with the AI at the start of the race, ramming into me as I late brake to cut ahead. Hitting/tapping your brakes by accident while midair will send your car flying out of control when you come down.A major gripe I have with the game is that they dangle certain cars in front of your face, you upgrade them to use in the next teir (D -> C) and yet you can't use them (i.e. can't use the Nissan 200sx in C races). I want to use this ""Silvia"" to race against those WRX, Evo, and Focus (lol) but some reason even with upgrades, the only Nissans I can use are the 350z (why not the 370z?) or the G35 Coupe (my beloved RWD VQ35DE).

												I like so much about this game over even the best driving games that I've played before, but the controls just completely ruin it for me.  I've applied every tweak, every fix I can but every FR and MR car cannot be driven on the limit (at least not with my 360 pad) because as soon as you try and counter oversteer the car veers off.  If you catch that, it switches in the other direction.  Just trying to keep the car on the tarmac alone is difficult let alone maintaining the perfect line through corners.  Races are best won by upgrading your car to the point that it doesn't slide and you can coast it around on 3/4 throttle.It could have been so great with some further testing and refining, but as the developer openly acknowledges they had to release it in it's current state.

												I would not recommend this game without the ""polished tyre mod"" (PTMu v1.79) which fixes the terrible slidey physics into something more like a simulation. Other than that Shift 2 is a nice simcade; challenging AI, great selection of tracks, cars, and customization options, good car sounds, and a lengthy career mode. The worst thing about this game and pretty much my only major complaint is the UI, almost impossible to navigate with the mouse&keyboard, so I have to use my shifter d-pad to get around the menus because using the mouse is really glitchy and unresponsive and slow			",114,22,11,29,34,1,25

												Very excited to play this game.. Starts my first race and I am greeted with: Low FPS, *VERY* bad unplayable input lag and the game looking ugly.. completely off and I'm playing with keyboard, not some third-party PS3 Controller Drivers. My specs are as follows: GPU: R9 270X OC GIGABYTE CPU: AMD ATHLON QUAD CORE 750K @3.4 GHZ Obviously this is WAY above the recommended specs for a smooth 1080p60fps or higher experiense. I search around the internet and it looks like more people has this issue and well now ill have to spend the rest of my night searching around for fixes and eventually hopefully getting it fixed.

												I had high expectations for this game.A notorious series for it's fun, unrealistic racing games moving into more simulated racing experience? It sounds like it could have potential to me, but then I bought it and I, a fan of racing games of this genre, hated it.Don't get me wrong, the graphics are top-notch and the scenario of the game is also brilliant; something that many games of the same genre lack and need overall in my opinion, but the game itself - physically - irritated me.There is an imput lag within the hame, and whilst it is only small, overall, it affects a racing game moreso than most. The time that it took for the responses to take action ruined the whole experience, as I was unable to make corners in time or brake at the exact right distance from the corner, whereas in other games it would have been alright. A higher powered PC than mine might be able to handle it, however, the problem seems to affect a large amount of the audience that play the game.The physics also annoy me. They are so light, it is almost like someone has attatched a group of helium baloons to the cars as so they float. This would be okay, I guess if not for the juiced-up, ROID RAGING, AI drivers, of whose sole purpose is to shove you off the track. Some may see this a being ""Fun"" and ""Well Programmed"", however, I can see that the opposite cars are meant to follow a ceirtain track and do not adjust that as so to avoid you down straights and corners, making them hit you if you go inside of the corner fairly - I'm not talking about rusing into the corner as so the others hit you, but coming into the corner in line with another racer, of whom shoves you out of line for no absolute reason other than for them trying to follow a direct path through the corner, of which is interrupted. Bad coding is the reason for this, I would presume.Finally, the last thing that annoys me is the modes. They would be fine in any other game, but in this game speciffically, they do not work. Drifting is the equivalent of spinning out until a path is found, of which you repeat for a while before the game notices and gives you an amount of points equivalent to a small amount of drift, as the mechanics of picking up on drifts are basically broken beyond belief. The races, coupled with bad AI and physics are unbearible and the drag events... well, they were ok, actually, you dont turn, just drive in a straight line. If only there were more than three of them.Overall, this game is bad in my opinion, but strangely infatuating to return to, even though you know you will have a bad time. Why I have been on it for 17.5 hours is beyond me. I would not get this If I were looking for a racing game at all. I would instead resort to the internet looking for sim racers. I found a good Free to Play one recently called SimRaceWay, of which is worth a look, it is much better than this game to many a regard.			",128,27,32,6,10,0,3

I went through the online forums and Steam support, and tried for hours to fix the game to no avail.  I enjoyed it up until it started crashing, but I do not reccomend buying this game, since not being able to start races defeats the purpose of this particular game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If the handling wasn't so laggy, I could ignore the narrator. But when you get to faster cars, it's just impossible to drive smoothly.

												shift 2 is trying too hard to be a racing sim when the need for speed series is focused on arcade racers instead so the driving model is not right it's too ""knife edge"" when the car spins out too easily and feels like the cars are lighter than a feather and on a laptop keyboard the controls are not responsive enough but the game has a lot of good tracks, cars and tuning capabilities.

												A well done racing game by NFS. Finally less arcade more sim (with the right mods instlled!) and with a twist of ""action moments"". I'm really enjoying this title so far and will do for quite a while actually! Recommended on the fly!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is at first somewhat frustrating when trying to drive and tune your own dream car, however once you get used to the more realistic handling, that challenge in itself is quite fun.  If you follow the planned career path you might not realize what I mean, but as soon as I unlocked the RX-7 and took it for a spin, I found I couldn't handle it; after hours of playing around and tuning different cars, I came back to it, and was able to drive it nearly perfectly.  Give the game a chance, and you'll have some fun with it.  If you're a perfectionist who likes to tune cars to match your driving style, you'll love this game.			",251,22,9,16,13,0,12

												Sometimes Shift 2 Unleashed tries a little too hard regarding realism. Due to that I never took place in a real race seat it's just a small and maybe unimportant feeling that I have about it.I played a lot of NFS Games, some of them were quite funny and challenging, some as Carbon, Most Wanted 2012 and Nitro were more like a stop-doing-that-thing kinda game. Shift 2 Unleashed is absolutly a YES in the NFS series - IF you like to have a challenge. Keep in mind that it is a simulator-near game, with options to make it easier for you. The career mode is well designed and - for me - well balanced. The amount of cars is great, the money and experience system is also great. You will face a whole load of upgrades and tuning possibilities depending on the installed upgrades. There is even a function to tune your car for a specific track - which is damn great. In case you enjoy good and less-arcade racing games, Shift 2 Unleashed is a DO.			",340,78,18,55,52,7,63

												Having played this previously on XBox 360, I was looking forward to this being my racing game of choice on my return to PC gaming. Whilst the graphics are nicer, everything else about this game seems so far to be inferior to the XBox version.First of all the game refused to run via Steam, and I had to create a shortcut for the desktop and run it as administrator. OK, fair enough, that's just PC gaming.But the real problems started once I began racing, where I found the controls (using the same 360 controller I had used on the console) to be sluggish and unresponsive, almost as if there was a delay. I've been playing the Next Car Game recently, and there the controls were snappy enough.Where the cars in the 360 version felt like they were a part of you, in the PC version they feel remote and unconnected. Even worse, in the chase view the car appears to vibrate at times, almost like it's doing a belly dance! WTF? I needed to use the chase view because in the first person views the delay or stodginess of the controls meant that I didn't have any real idea of how the car was responding. At least in chase view the car bears some relation to the road.I tried setting up the responsiveness in the options menu, but even with the sensitivity at 100% there wasn't enough response until the stick was fully extended, and then there was often too much. This made it almost impossible to hold the racing line, and the car veered crazily all over the place.I'm not a newbie to racing games, but this game made me feel like a novice!This was a real disappointment to me, and I could not in all honesty recommend the game.

 ITASHA IS LOVE, ITASHA IS LIFE I can make Itasha mod !! *_______*I've been a fan of Gran Turismo since the first one, but sadly it didn't come to PC, and also don't let you to make skin mods! I have GT6 on PS3 but I already left it, cause I really don't like playing game on console. Such a hassle.. The graphic is realistic enough and fast enough to run on Potato powered PC like mine. I use Steam version instead of Origin version, and it runs really fine, no problem, no crash, no lag.And if you are wondering, my Shift 2 U are modded (Removing cutscene, and car reskin), so even it's modded, it still runs fine.My PC are Core i3 3.10GHz, 8GB DDR3, Nvidia GT730 1GB GDDR5, Windows 10 64bit. EDIT : If you are mad with Activation Limit DRM, you can just revoke the activation using Activation.exe on game folder (Not that hard lol), They say Origin version don't have DRM, you can get the CD Key and redeem on Origin.

I can't play it.The keyboard controls even with a mod take a full second to respond to commands, The cars have no turning, even the sensitive and tuned ones. I tried adapting my controls, but I plain flat don't own any controlers and this game is unplayable. I had been salavating over this one for a long time too. I came into it with a happy mind, ready to be treated to a good game only to get cars that don't turn.I don't get money very often in my name, so when I choose to invest in a game, it really breaks my heart when it turns out to be unplayable. Maybe I'll change my mind if I ever get a controller.			",209,45,2,33,27,1,29

												The game is notorious for its difficulty, but I call it a steep learning curve, and games like this tend to be addictive after you start to get the hang of it. Shift 2 is certainly one of the best racing games I have ever played, the thrill of speed it creates is just so intense that it pushes you on your seat, and the satisfaction you receive after you get used to the game physics and start to win races is downright rewarding.  What's more, the graphics is crystal sharp and clean, it's simply beautiful to look at.However it does suffer from the poor implementation of EA features causing the game to crash very often when you play online. So buy it, be patient, play offline, and you should be fine.Oh and...♥♥♥♥ drifting.			",128,46,3,46,18,0,18

												Quite a lot of fun once you mute all the voices in the game. Feels like a Gran Turismo experience.			",146,9,11,13,7,0,7

												This is more realistic than I've come to expect from the Need for Speed franchise, and that's a good thing. My only gripe are the annoy, unskippable videos that seem to play every time you click through a menu. Fortunately they can be turned off... by deleting them.			",163,24,3,5,7,0,27

												if Gran Turismo is the best simulation style Racing game for PS3, and Forza is the same for Xbox 360, this game has to be the equivalent for PC. i could also try to argue for GRID, but without the car customization and upgrades, it falls short. if you are looking to buy a racing game, buy this one,  trust me. it may seem difficult, or frustrating at first, but if you can enjoy this game enough to stick with it, you'll be able to ace any racing game you play after this one.

												Oooh, oooh it's an updated revuew.....I liked this game when it came out, my pc was not quite so keen as it had difficulty doing all the sums and mathsy bs that it needed to do in time to make it go fast enough to be reaally cool.Now I don't know about you, but I'm not taking any whining from my machine, after all, isn't that how skynet started? So.. having had it removed and 'dealt with' I now have the necessary horsepower to make this game run like I'm sure it's meant to and OMG! ZOMG! and ZOMFG! it's awesome.The sound is fantastically well done, the sensation of speed is good enough to cause self-soiling and the hardest bits are bloody difficult. The tracks you race on aren't the usual predictable ones and also include the insanity of the nordschliefe for if you think Dignitas is for lightweights. Big load of cars to choose froom and upgrade and onlyTwo minor faults1) You can't get out of your car to go and batter the tw@ that has just ruined your chances in a race 2) If you use an X-Box contrtoller it's way too twitchy unless you invest a few minutes fannying round getting the advanced settings correctly set up.Basically, if you don't think this game is grrrrrreat then you are a queg			",278,30,42,5,20,2,16

												I'm going to say this plainly, to start this off. I 'HATE' this game.Why? I can't play it.The keyboard controls even with a mod take a full second to respond to commands, The cars have no turning, even the sensitive and tuned ones. I tried adapting my controls, but I plain flat don't own any controlers and this game is unplayable. I had been salavating over this one for a long time too. I came into it with a happy mind, ready to be treated to a good game only to get cars that don't turn.I don't get money very often in my name, so when I choose to invest in a game, it really breaks my heart when it turns out to be unplayable. Maybe I'll change my mind if I ever get a controller.			",209,45,2,33,27,1,29

												Fantastic game, love all the NFS games, but this one for whatever reason will not quit stopping in the middle of gameplay right before it enters a race...			",21,1,5,8,2,0,2
