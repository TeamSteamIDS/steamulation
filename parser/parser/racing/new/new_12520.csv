												I LOVED this game when it first came out. That said, I loved ALL of SCS's trucking games throughout the 18WoS series. The game has decent control, great economy and company management and brilliant truck ownership detail. Before I get ahead of myself, however, here's a real list of pros and cons to this game:=PROS=- Decent graphics: This game may be old, and it does show it's age, but the graphics still look alright, if a little dull at times.- Good control: This game is no ETS2, but it definitely feels right. Its a bit slick at times, but you have to remember you are driving a heavy truck.- Company management: Manage everything from the trucks, to the drivers, right down to the contracts and companies.- Truck AND trailer management: ETS2 fans will like this... You can BUY TRAILERS. Just a little bit of extra management and a bit of extra content to buy.=CONS=- AGE: This game shows it's age... alot. The sound is low quality, the graphics are dull as stated before... it's an old game.- Bugs: This game has its share of bugs and issues. I personally have problems with the fov not setting properly. I have to manually set it for it to look right.- Fatigue: The game's fatigue system is realistic to the game time, but the distances to game time are not realistic. I woke up at the edge of a city, and by the time I got to the other side, I had to sleep again. I suggest turning fatigue off in the config files.- Scenery: This game also shows it's age in scenery. It's a bit dull and repeatitive.I enjoyed the game, and I still go back and play it occasionally. I would reccomend the game to anyone who likes other 18wos games, or trucking games in general.

												A classic truck driving game, especially fun if you're a fan of other truck simulator games such as ETS and ETS2 by the same developers!While obviously not as polished as it's more recent cousins, it most certainly has it's charm and can still live up to an enjoyable driving simulator, especially for the cracking price this gem usually is at sales.Naturally I recommend this game because of it's nice scenary, mission variety, controller support and just how well built it is. I haven't had a single crash with this game.If you have a gaming wheel like I do with my Logitech Driving Force GT then you'll be happy to know you can also use them with this game. So what are you waiting for? Get trucking!			",1095,265,59,122,171,5,161

												18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul is a Trucking Simulator. You start off with a truck, which you will use to pick up and drop off delivery jobs you choose to accept. From refueling your rig, to stopping at weigh stations and getting some sleep, 18 Wheels of Steel is a pretty decent sim. Even on Easy mode, you need to be careful of how you drive and make sure to obey traffic laws, such as turn signals and stop lights. I started playing it thinking I would put in the bare minimum just to get a taste for the game so I could write about it, but found it to be mildly addictive. I have yet to complete my first haul, but I am confident I will get there soon. 18 Wheels of Steel does not have a playable tutorial, so you will learn on the fly. From what I understand of the game, the rigs you drive are based on real life trucks, so there is an element of realism the makers have brought into the game to give you an immersive experience. There are dozens of cities across North America, each with their own unique layout, making some of the deliveries an interesting challenge. All in all I thought it was a pretty fun game. If you like Simulators, this isn't a bad one.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

18 Wheels of Steel: American Long HaulSCS is well known for their titles of the 18 Wheels Of Steel series. This game alone was a big role in my childhood. This game I have spent days and hours on in my youth everytime I had the time. Please ignore my steam playing time, I've played over 100+ Hours in the past before I had steam, and the game was gifted to me.Also Note: 18 Wheels of Steel: Haulin' isn't on the steam page, although it's exactly the same, but this is more of a expansion going into parts of Mexico.What Do You Do?Well, like all my other reviews that are from SCS, they are all the same. You get trucks, drive, and deliver cargo from point A to point B.What's The Different Between These Games, Compared to American Truck Simulator?See, there isn't much any difference. All these games that SCS made is based upon for people who love to drive trucks. The Mapsize alone covers the whole entire united stated unlike American Truck Simulator. The game is also dated to today's standards. This game itself is a classic, and always will be. The graphics are rather 'meh' at least when I play it now, unlike before the graphics were amazing when it got released years ago!How Much Is It Worth To Get?Imagine 18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul as the downgraded version of American Truck Simulator. Like I mentioned already, this game is further more a downgrade, and if you have graphical issues, or don't have a powerful enough PC, this game alone will be a great alternative.My Final VerdictIf you have the PC specs to run AAA games, you would be best to get American Truck Simulator. This game alone isn't bad, but I would highly reccomend it if you get it if it's your last resort. It has everything that's included but less detailed. You can have Double-Trailers Something ATS nor ETS2 has. You have your standard Day/Night Cycle, plus Weather. There's plenty of trucks to pick from, surprisingly more of a selection to what ATS is.For a classic, and this game being played the heck out of in my youth I would highly recommend this as alot of memories have been kept iwhile playing this. You also don't need a powerful gaming rig. Heck, my fathers old Windows XP played this game well. For a final rating, I would give this game simply a 9.2/10. ",196,10,24,7,31,0,11

												The 18 Wheels of Steel series has come a long way since its humble beginnings back in 2002. Tagged as Hard Truck: 18 Wheels of Steel (which was a sequel to Hard Truck 2: King of the Road), it was the first that used the Wheels of Steel tag name as the game play differs completely from racing trucks delivering goods. Since then, there were another four instalments where, besides the graphical enhancements, many changes were made like Mexico being left out then arrived back, sleep timer comes and goes and so on. It seems that every game after the first, developers ValuSoft couldn’t make up their minds what to leave out or to use. Well, the sixth game in the series, 18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul, it seems ValuSoft finally made up their minds and just chuck everything in from all the previous series thus making this game the ‘final copy’. And it certainly shows as this simulator will be the closest you ever get other than driving the real thing.So my real purpose for playing this game is for the love of driving. America / Canada and bits of Mexico has a diverse range of landscapes to discover and thankfully, the game’s visual aspects is quite decent. Nothing ground breaking however still pleasant to look at. In addition to the pretty decent physics, you have a good feel driving around with a massive haul trailing behind. For instance, delivering glass was pretty easy going however when I delivered those oversize tubes through the Rocky Mountains (i.e. from Calgary to Vancouver), with snow smashing on my windscreen, it got my adrenaline running as I need to be very careful dodging traffic as well as ensuring my truck doesn’t tip over. And because you can play your own music using the truck’s radio player, it’s a great experience to have (yet the music needs to be on .ogg format).So whilst the game’s intent is to build an empire, I felt it failed in that respect as there’s no competition at all. You can sit back, relax and listen to your radio channel whilst having the cash rolling in. Granted, the beginning is quite rough as you need to do some real repetitive jobs (X – Beyond the Frontier anyone?) however once you have the money to buy another truck, trailer and hire additional helpers, the game’s difficulty level gets a lot easier. However, if you, like me, like to drive the open world and seeing vast landscapes, you will enjoy this game as America is a pretty country to see. With its majestic mountain ranges, endless deserts, Great Plains and of course, bustling cities, developers Valusoft chose the correct country to display all of this. However, because it also plays on as a business simulation, it missed the mark.Full review:http://www.gamespot.com/18-wheels-of-steel-american-long-haul/user-reviews/2200-12653156/8 / 10			",729,433,34,169,129,5,185

												Bought within a set a long time ago and decided to play it again, so price isn't a factor in this. Also, I do not normally play driving games (racing or otherwise) and have not played Euro Truck Simulator 2 (newer by the same developer).Pros:- Surprisingly good traffic AI (although not very realistic), they normally slow down for ya, but had a guy run me off the road after a weigh station.- Surprising depth and possible re-playability.- Decent graphics for a 7 year old game.Cons:- Poor key bindings (did not have a steering wheel)- Repetitive (as can be expected I guess)- Difficulty entering cities from highways- Bad camera anglesTo elaborate, I enjoyed my few hours of playing. My time was spent making a delivery from Dallas to El Paso (something), El Paso to Albuquerque (Coal), Albuquerque to Dallas (Explosives). I found the West and East legs to be easy and tedious, with the north and south legs to be more difficult. I noticed that there's a way to buy many trucks and trailers as well as have contracts created for companies. I did not investigate the business side of the game, but do know it's there for another play time.I used a key pad which had most of the keys bound to and found that the bindings were not terrible, but limiting. I could not use the number pad to answer radio calls and had no idea what each of the codes meant.All in all, my biggest gripe was the limited access road to high way connections. When heading south on I35 from I40, I had to go through Dallas and come back around in order to reach my destination. This was the most annoying of the destinations, but I had a similar problem in El Paso and Albuquerque. tl;dr: In summary, I would recommend this to someone who is a fan of the genre, otherwise I wouldn't. 4/10 ",95,11,3,14,60,0,33

												If, like me, you are too impatient to wait for American Truck Simulator to be finished then this game is the best when it comes to driving trucks across the United States from coast to coast. It is by no means a perfect game but it is one of the best in the 18 Wheels of Steel series. The series includes seven games, but only three of them are on Steam. Most fans prefer the previous ""18 Wheels of Steel: Haulin'"", but I think that's only because the modding community was more active for that one. Unless you absolutely need replicas of popular trucks then I think it's okay to do without them. Other than that, both games are nearly identical to each other. The only major difference is that American Long Haul has more cities to explore. Not only is the mainland United States traversible (not Hawaii and Alaska), but you can also visit parts of Canada and Mexico. I think that alone makes American Long Haul worth playing over any other trucking simulator.Like I said, the map is huge; covers all of the country with most major cities being represented. The ony downside to this is that there is no route advisor. A world map and a mini-map on the screen are the only tools that can help you get get around. It's kind of annoying at first having to go back and forth to the map to familiarize yourself with the roads. But then I started liking the challenge because it reminds me of the old days before GPS was available and drivers actually had to use road maps.One thing I really like about this game and which I think is sorely needed today is the CB radio feature. During your travels you can hear other drivers on the radio asking for weather and traffic reports and you can actually respond to them with a response menu by pressing the ""v"" key. It doesn't appear to do anything at first except give you a warm feeling inside, but apparently it helps your reputation grow and opens up more drivers for hire later on.There's no option for using internet radio like you can in other SCS games, but you can import your own music. In that case you must convert your MP3s to the OGG format and there are websites you can use for doing that without downloading anything. I imported a few radio stations from GTA and they sound very nice and natural in this game.My biggest gripe would have to be the steering. There is a mod somewhere that lets you steer with a mouse, but I prefer using a keyboard for steering. It works for me in other driving games, and until I actually buy a steering wheel that is what I'm going to use. Unfortunately, in this game, the wheel auto-centers itself too quickly so you're having to constantly jam on the ""a"" and ""d"" keys when making a sharp turn. It's not a total inconvenience, but it takes some time to get used to. If it bothers you that much then I would suggest a controller.Hard to believe that SCS made this game so many years ago and there's actually more ground to cover than in any of their recent games. American Truck Simulator was released with only two states and Euro Truck Simulator 2 is being finished by modders. But they have stuck with the same formula over the years and, aside from graphics, their games have remained the same.American Long Haul is not much different from ETS 2 or American Truck Simulator. You're still a truck driver managing your own company; you take jobs and deliver loads; you hire drivers to work for you; when you get tired you pull off the side of the road and sleep; when you need gas you go to the filling station; police give you a hard time; and when you get money you can buy more trucks. And really, what else do you need? Why not just skip the DLC fest and play this game instead?			",393,112,9,82,137,8,130

												This game runs perfectly on Windows 10 still. The fact is, it's an old game from SCS published around 2007 as one of 18 Wheels of Steel series. SCS is also the author of the overwhelmingly postive Euro Track Simulator 2. Theme of this game is logistics, you buy a tow track, transporting stuffs like evacuator, to destination anywhere you want from job list.However since this game is pretty old, it has poor sorta suck 3D support IMO (Prism3d engine? Not even heard of that), plus AI is dull to hell. When you meet cops, just cut out the engine and wait there. After a while you can continue, or just save & reload (a little bit tricky). I coulnd't find anywhere like this amidst countries I've been to.A simulator of real life circumstances/experience should provide acceptable graphics for targets at least, but this game is not that case. If you enjoy truck driving, buy it without regret but don't expect too much. It can't offer you endlessly fun in game, but only driving, what, you mean you want to enjoy the landscape? You will feel sorry about that again. For kids in new era, don't expect them whiling hours in 18WOS ALH.I suggest you all buying ETS2 since it has massive imporvements of graphics, less bugs like falling from ground or suddenly out of screen, and more intelligent elements regarding AI, and so on. If you insist on buying this for whatever reason, do it during sales.			",1017,359,35,129,134,6,191

												I don't have much to say about this game, other than that its systems are very good - starting off may be a little hard but after 4-6 jobs you start hiring more workers and  get more experienced - buying new cabs for you and your workers and new trailers for your company, doing contracts, etc. The scenery isn't the best but the game is old. The time it takes to get somewhere my be a little long, but it isn't anything too long. Some people say it is the exact distance in real life - but I am not sure to this rumor. Driving may be boring sometimes, but somehow you get over it for either unexplainable reasons, or watching the scenery and cars, or talking to yourself, or you look at your map, or just stopping at rest stops and seeing civilization can get over that boringness... Somehow... One thing I partly dislike about the game, is traffic. Yeah, the traffic is low and you can get somewhere quickly, but I don't enjoy how there are not too much medium or high traffic occasions - Sometimes, the cars infront slow down to a speed causing all the cars to slow down aswell, slowing down the whole process for a while until the front cars speed up. I think how long you stay in the traffic and when/how it happens is just fine, I am just kind of mad at acctidents: Very rarley does an acctident happen, and when it does, all traffic is held up because of the cars in the acctident turning on their blinkers, not letting any cars or trucks pass them. This goes on and on and on and probably never ends, just sitting there, I've never had the patience to wait. To resolve this issue you have to advance time so all the cars would disappear... I just dislike how nothing happens. I see ambulances, fire trucks and police cruisers around the city and interstates. If there is a crash, I would have liked to notify truckers, which might (somehow) notify emergency services, and they may come responding to resolve the issue. But don't get your hopes up for any updates, SCS Software is NOT coming back to a game this old. With all the Euro Truck Simulator, Extreme Trucker, and the all new American Truck Simulator (as of this writing it is very new), there is no point coming back to this game. Overall, the game deserves an 8/10 for its organzation, system on building up your trucking empire and other aspects I may or may not have mentioned. For more information about  the game or other games made by the company - visit SCS Software Forums.EDIT:I also forgot to tell you that you should be saving at least every in game day or every 30 real life minutes due to a ""Prism3D.exe"" error. Basically - after playing around 30 minutes - 1 hour, the game crashes showing a file saying ""Prism3D.exe"" error. I have seen negative reviews just because of this problem. I warn you to keep saving or you might just not like the game because of one technical error.			",10,0,3,0,5,0,1

												This game is an excellent precursor to the euro truck simulator series as well as the upcoming American Truck Simulator from SCS. It has few minor issues that may deter many gamers from giving this classic title its due. The cities are not fleshed out. They are essentially hubs to drop cargo and get new assignments. The Fines for stopping too far over the line at red lights seems rediculously high, and the braking distance for a bobtailed tractor is a little far, but oh well. The meat of this game is spent driving miles and miles of bland landscapes sharing the road with what appears to be all students on their first day of drivers education classes.Having said all that, however, I still enjoyed playing this game and finding out by trial and error what we were supposed to be doing, other than delivering and picking up cargo. If you enjoy simulation games, this may peak your interest. If you are more of the Need for Speed type, pass this by.			",10,0,1,3,12,0,3

												This was what i used to play back when i was about maybe 7 and i wasnt allowed on the internet. I played this game day after day until the disk somehow broke into peices while in the cd drive and i havent played it for 4 years since. Then i realized this was on steam for a price of 9.99. Then i bought it so much nostalgia.  So on to the reviewThis game was made back in 07 and its impresive with how good it looks even for being 7 years old.  There getting old but they still look good,Pros.-Graphics look nice for a game made back in 07-Good game to run on older pc's that cant run euro truck simulator 2 (or 1) -Affordible-Many trucks to buy in game (with ingame cash not dlc) -Single delivery mode (You have infinate money and you can choose any truck you want)-Pretty decent Ai traffic (But not very realistic though)-Capable of modding (No workshop support but online you can download trucks and other things and simply drop it in your mods folder in the 18 wheels of steel directoryDocuments>18 wos american long haul> ModsCons.-Hard to enter cities from highways (Or interstates)-Annoying controls-Minor glitches barely noticible thoughSo heres my ratingGraphics: 9/10 These graphics are good for a 07 game.Gameplay: 9/10 (Gets repetive but who would of guessed)Music: 7/10 Music was ok but in game theres a radio in your truck that you can add your own music to (Google it)overal. 8.5/10Bottom line.

												          One of the first games to tap into the anti-authoritarian aspects of the Citizen's Band (CB) radio craze, ""18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul"" is basically a movie-length car chase and a pleasantly insipid slice of late-'70's Americana. The tissue-thin plot has good ole boy pals running a load of fosters cross-country on a tight deadline while trying to avoid an assortment of less-than-bright cops. The player jumps into the part of ""the trucker"", a heart-throb for all white-trash trailer dwelling women, to a tee. SCS Software does an impeccable job of bringing to life the role of the backwards southern lifestyle. The soundtrack was an instant classic, combining folk, bluegrass and country, and leaving the player with an urge to recite the lyrics for days after.  As you can tell by my gamer handle screen name, I love this game. I do regard this video game as an all time favorite, VGA material? Certainly not. But who cares. A must play for all serious game players.2/10			",346,41,3,30,32,1,52

												An old predecessor to American Truck Simulator. If you want to drive a truck in american surroundings, go for ATS instead.It was well made game with wheel support, good physics, trucking jobs, traffic rules etc. Nowadays it is slow motion game (driving 55 mph looks like driving 15 mph) with old graphic and control. Good for collecting old games from our childhood, not good for playing theese times.			",731,158,61,90,308,8,201

What is this game?If you're a redneck and love doing the deed with your own offspring, then this game is for you. Jokes aside, 18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul is a truck simulator and not a very good one. There are many 18 Wheels of Steel games in the series, but so far this is the only one I've played, so experiences may be compared to the likes of Euro Truck Simulator 1 & 2.What's the gameplay like?Honestly... Very lackluster. The controls are absolutely diabolical and feel like you're driving a bathtub on wheels around the road. Finding out where you are going is also a pain too, as there is near-enough, no GPS in the game compared to the other sims. However, the game is quite old, so you can't fault it for its graphics that have aged very terribly and also the graphical glitches that come with playing the game. How big is the map compared to other games?This feels more like Euro Truck Simulator 1, compared to 2 in terms of size. However, you do get the entirety of the USA to explore as well as parts of Canada and Mexico. Locations also feel bland honestly and driving from area to area in the same vicinity as before can feel taxing on the brain. Any other points you would like to make?I have a few things I'd like to say.1. There are cops in this game. Which was weird so essentially you could get 'pulled over' for running a light, although saying that, the police in this game don't even move an inch from when they sound their sirens. If you stay further away from the cops than what's needed, you can easily not get fined at all on your journey.2. You can do single journeys. This is great in a sense as you can literally choose where you start and where you end and you can do a delivery like that. Euro Truck Simulator 2 needs to implement a system like this honestly. 3. There is a lack of music. Besides the menu music, there is no music in-game whatsoever. Even the in-game radio only has the menu music listed as an .ogg file. Weird.Conclusion?This game is pretty bad honestly. I recommend picking up the later truck simulator games like ETS 2 and American Truck Simulator instead. If not, just try picking up the first Euro Truck game instead. That's pretty good. 3/10			",55,6,9,12,6,2,3

												A game that makes full use of the 900 degree rotation on a logitech G25/27! This game is all about running your own trucking company - you can pick your cargo, destination, truck, other drivers etc. Build a company with a fleet of trucks and drivers to dominate the haulage across America. There is something quite soothing about driving in this game - it removes pressure from driving that you normally experience in most driving games. It is replaced with different kinds of pressure - such as juggling sleep, not damaging precious cargo and even avoiding speeding fines).It is reccommended you do use a wheel for this but not essential. Would imagine that anything else apart from a wheel would take away from this fantastic sim! There are even communities that have virtual companies you can work for!			",54,7,9,3,3,0,7

												This may have been a good game when it first came out, but it isn't really all the great of a game now.  SCS software improved slightly with Euro Truck Simulator. Controls are difficult, truck takes forever to slow down.  Fatigue happens way too fast.  Driving distances are ok, though.  Graphics are definitely outdated.  Dashboards and the trucks are very decent, but a bit squarish in shape.Do yourself a favor and buy Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator.

												Upon release, virtually every aspect of 18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul recieved unprecedented praise. Flexibility of approach, depth of gameplay, a uniquely fascinating world and the rare gall to bring literary inspiration to a medium oft dismissed as ""low art"". Everything that was said was, and remains, true; you'll find few aspects of  18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul that fall short of its monolithic critical reception. And yet, as if I need heap further praises upon this exquisite, immortal behemoth; the game is greater than the sum of its parts.  18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul finds countless methods of meaningfully intertwining gameplay, presentation and narrative. Its true, emergent magic blooms herein; where all three facets strengthen one another. Every mechanic, no matter how innocuous, refers to, is given frightening new relevance in the light of, the game's themata. Tragic character has been breathed into each and every one of its objects, its powers,			",535,59,37,39,58,7,75

												Although i really enjoy this game. I do think that PTTM still remains the best in the series. The reason for that is the fact that after spending around an hour of work getting to my destination, the game decides the fustrate me by greeting me with a Prism3D.exe error, Half an hour later, it happens again, i reinstalled the game and it continued to crash. This causes the game to quit to the desktop at any random given time. This is very fustrating of course. That's 1 hour of my life i will never get back. However, other than the frequent crashes and the poor draw distance, This game is very good, the game has lots of potential and i think it could be improved. So right now i can't reccomend this game untill it gets fixed.  Happy (Sort of) Trucking!			",161,33,11,19,23,1,9

												I have to say that I am a bit disappointed. I didn't realize that this game was actually made in 2007 so that is entirely my fault. The reason I am putting that I would not recomend this game is because I purchased it at 9.99 and it's only worth about 1.99 for today's standards, if that. We have better options and a company that wants to put something like this on the market should actually continue to make new versions to keep up with the standards. This is all based on Today's standards vs. Today's price, year 2014.So the actual review is that the graphix are low end on high settings, not worth the price. The game lacks good control configuration though has limited keyboard/joypad binding. The actual controls are horrid - no smooth driving wheel rotation to keep on the winding roads(compairing to current standards of games that sell for 9.99 keep in mind). I like the idea of police on the side of roads, but the don't actually pull you over and a ticket is way high for the lack of any kind of justice system. Two thousand dollars for a red light run is too much for a first offense even if you are guilty.I personally think that you could spend your money on their more current games and get a better value. I would just take this off the market and make a new one if I were SCS. They do have better games.			",59,23,1,19,48,0,24

												I'm really torn to say if I recommend this game or not, It's a good game, but at the same time there are games much like it that are better. Years ago I loved playing this game, but Euro Truck Simulator 2 basically ruined this game for me... If you want a alturnitive to ETS2 this is a okay one (much better than extream truckers IMO too). but if your looking for a really good truck sim, jump to Euro Truck Simulator 2 instead.Also the people making Euro truck simulator 2 are making a America version too, so that should be fun. ;)PS I just realized ETS2 and This are made by the same Developer.Anyway I'm going to go with No, wait for the America Truck simulator (my name for it :P) or get Euro Truck simulator, it's better than this game, even though this game isn't really bad. Plus youre atleast helping the same Developers. :)			",38,5,7,1,33,0,10

												Right off the bat I'm going to say this game isn't worth $10. I managed to pick it up and at an insanely low price of $3, which it then, becomes good value. It models most of North America, albiet smaller. Driving from Florida to Vancouver will still take you the better part of 6-10 hours, so small is an overstatement. You can drive a decent selection of big rigs, and the game's compatible with most gamepads and wheels. Get contracts, haul countless types of cargo and drive across country in the snow, rain and of course sunny weather. Everything works on the truck, indicators, fuel, cops will even fine you for infractions. Talk to other trucks via radio about the weather, traffic reports or whatever else is relevant. Though it's not particularly pretty it does a great job at mimicing the lifestyle of a trucker... though, who the hell wants to be a trucker. 6 / 10			",271,69,31,22,45,3,23

												This is the best game ever. The 1 metre draw distance really allows you to suck in the beauty of the gorgeous textures that burn your retinas. The pop-in is great because it gives you a nice shock when a car pops into existance and you crash into it, adds a layer of tension that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The legal system is charmingly weird, as carnage will net you a fine of about $4.50 but running a red light, well, be expected to pay about $8000. The cabins were expertly designed, it's almost as if the game designers were real truck drivers. The driving mechanics are spot on, never have i felt more like i am driving an office chair with three broken wheels. The choice of drivers is a bit unrealistic most truck drivers don't make me feel anyone near as hot as those vague outlines did. All in all i think this game has perfectly captured what it is like to be a truck driver in America and how thrilling every day must be. Buy it for someone you don't like.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TLDR: Fun for a few hours, car AI sucks, cops are unfair, driving is okay, hauls take too long, slow to make money, some very fun opportunites to jump your truck.Its fun, but i wouldn't recommend it. The driving mechanics are okay, its annoying that there is no completely player controlled shifting mode. Turn signals don't do ♥♥♥♥, but emergency lights will make anyone near you slam on their brakes, which can be alot of fun on a boring long haul. There is a decent amount of road in this game, enough that long hauls take a very long time. It is too easy to damage the trailer, and it is also WAY too easy to run red lights. Effective braking can be accomplished by using the pedal brakes (S), the jake brake (B), and the parking brake (Space). Cars will honk at you for waiting patiently behind other cars at red lights. Cars will also make sudden turns in the wrong lanes that will ♥♥♥♥ you up. Cars will also turn right into your trailer without realizing that it is there until too late. Cops are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and can ticket you without even chasing you. If you pass by a cop on your side of the divided highway, they will ticket you, if you pass a cop on the other side of the road, they will pursue you, It is surprisingly easy to outrun the cops, but if you don't have some speed built up before you start the chase, you are screwed. Also, it helps to have some heavy traffic when in a police chase, the cops aren't the best at avoiding crashes. The sleeping mechanic in this game is annoying, without checking your driving logs you really have no idea when you are getting sleepy. There are also some glitchy spots where you can fall out of the map, as well as some AWESOME jump opportunities. It would take a very long time to make decent money by delivering cargo, so instead i found an alternative method. Buy CHEAP used trucks, i think trucks under $50,000 are ideal, then fix them up and sell them. This way allows you to make money very easily.  Don't buy expensive trucks and try to do this, the profit dissapears quickly as the price increases.			",40,0,4,3,7,0,3

												Runs at some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ resolution like 640x480, graphics are ♥♥♥♥ing godawful, crashes a healthy amount, boring, stupid premise, tedious gameplay where you get pulled over for speeding, KB+M controls don't lend themselves to anything having to do with Serious Driving. Other than that though, I was expecting to literally be given a dilation and curettage abortion through my scrotum of every organ involved with my urito-genital tract upon hitting ""PLAY,"" and that didn't happen, so I would consider this game a pleasant surprise despite its flaws.

												After years and years.... coming back to it made me feel like a kid again, that used to drive miles and miles... and never got tired of trucks along U.S. roads.The map is just enourmous, deliveries can take hours, which makes it more fun while listening to some music, the game may look old and the gameplay can feel a little like driving a vehicle with bald tyres, but that doesn't matter because if you are that type of person who enjoys landscapes, long ""hauls"" this game is a good fit.My only cons is that its a bit annoying to stop the truck and you must follow every road procedure or else your wanted bar will increase more and more(it'll decrease when you play it cool), also plan very well the deliveries you don't want to run out of fuel right?P.S: If you think you'll do repetitive deliveries like in ETS, you're wrong you can choose any delivery destination and any company to grab any type of trailer :310/10 Because nostalgia			",44,2,14,3,4,0,0

												Nice trucking game.In short:Visually nice, truck drives were nice. Random accidents on the road, heavy traffic during daytime.. and then rain.. yup that´s how it goes sometimes. Remarks:As said and recommended by others: turn cops and fatigue off makes it more relaxing to play.Recommend:Yes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												reccomend with a caution.Probably the best American truck driving game I have played, but it is an aging game engine. Graphics are okay, but somewhat dated. The textures are colorful, but flat looking.Cons------It took some work to get my gamepad where the truck is drivable.Fatigue seems to come on you to soon, but if you can reach the side of the road, and have a sleeper. You can sleep there.Camera angles make backing up in third person harder than it could be,roads are kind of bland.Resting system could have been better as far as what you do to rest.Pros-----If you run a red light. It is not an automatic penalty. If you can drive clean; your wanted level diminishes as loa=ng as you do not see the police parked on the side of the road.Many cargos to haul.Decent AI traffic. Not as smart as you would like, but decent enough.Short green lights.Based in America, and you can drive cross country.Inexpensive game to purchase.SCS is working on a new American Truck Simulator, and it will be far ans away better than this older game, but we do not know the system requirments yet.I give the game a mild recommendation. Accept the game for what it is, and not what you think it should have been, and you wiull be happy. Euro Truck Simulator 2 is far more advanced, and polished, but sometimes you just want to us the American road rules. ",39,2,10,4,24,2,9
