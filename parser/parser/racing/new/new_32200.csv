												Contrary to what was mentioned in another review and despite the lack of info on the store page, this game has no offline mode. It is an online-only DRM game. There is bot and LAN support, but you must still create an account with Black Jacket (email required) and log into their servers in order to play. If your internet connection is down, or if Black Jacket's servers are down, the game will not run at all. Further, Black Jacket has no publicly-viewable privacy policy that I could find, so be mindful of what they do with your personal data.It's good that there is at least bot support, because you will have a very difficult time finding anyone online to play with outside of special events. Unfortunately, the bot AI is very simplistic and rarely uses any sort of team tactics like passing and coordination, so you won't get much enjoyment at all if you're planning on playing solo.The core gameplay is fun - basically soccer with tanks. If you do have a group of friends to play with, you may get some enjoyment out of it, but I wouldn't recommend the game to anyone else.			",2108,726,60,251,157,20,289

												Wha is good on a Multiplayer game?The challenge of Player VS Player, correct?And what if you don't have friends to play with?Oh well, there must be a story mode, or at least a flat setting to set you up for action, right?So... what might go wrong here?Well Metal Drift firstly needs to register to play.I bought the game guys.... hello?????Why did you had to force us to register to play.Gee bad move, whatever.After the whole proccess I logged in to find what?Almost empty servers and.... no story mode.So If I wont convince a firend of mine to buy the game, I can not actually play it, right?Well guess what, this is a NO from me.It is a very VERY rare thing putting a thumbs down on a game.But I can't play it.No seriously... if I had some friends playign with me I could give it a shot and recommend it on discount.But now what can i do?!By the way, graphics are not something special... gameplay is average, can't tell if it is boring or not though, SINCE I CAN NOT PLAY ALONE....It's a no for me and I am really sorry.I know that fanboys will come and rate this down but I don't really care.Really, think about it.Spending money on a game you can not enjoy, how would YOU feel?

												very simplistic vehicular combat game - drive your (slightly customized loadout capable) hovertank, take the ball from the center of the map to enemy gate. the only thing stopping you is opposition tanks which are unfortunately also armed.visual style is simplistic yet somehow incredibly fitting. controls and loadouts are easy to pick up but surprisingly difficult to master.essentially it's a multiplayer-only game but a local game is available with bots as both teammates and opponents. bots do provide a comfortably wide range of challenge possibilities with the scaling bot difficulty.as long as you are not looking for anything more in this game than it is, it actually does work quite well.

												Metal Drift is a fun game for the very few hours you will playing it.It is a third person combat car game where you need to kill the opponent and take the ball in middle to score with it.Don't expect to play this over the net since there is never any servers running and if there is it is only 1 other person.I would highly recommend getting the 4-pack twice and play with 7 irl friends that is where this game gets fun.If on sale I would highly recommend buying it to try it out other than that there is far better games out there.

												Hey everyone. I bought this game quite some time ago now and enjoyed playing it over LAN at home with friends and against bots. I'd like to tell you what changes were made in the last update to this game, but I can't because the devs decided we now have to create an online account with password in order to play at all. It would've been nice to give people the option to continue playing over LAN without forcing players online with strangers. I enjoy playing multiplayer online sometimes, but there are plenty of times that I just don't want to. I enjoyed things the way they were. If you know nothing about the game, it's basically like the old Car Wars arena play from Steve Jackson Games, but these vehicles hover. I enjoyed the game a lot for what it's worth, but if you want to play you need to get used to the idea that an online account is required. I can't review any of the changes since the last major update that added the account requirement with no option to bypass. As it is, if you like cars and weapons in an arena, this is okay... but wait for it to go on sale. I do recommend the game overall with the notable provisions stated above. My kids didn't really like playing it very much. They'd rather play a lot of other games instead of this. I have deleted the game from my system, but if my kids ever change their minds about playing... maybe I'll make an account for it. Maybe. Sometimes I just want to play over LAN with people I know, but the devs excluded that option. Too bad.			",135,27,5,27,19,0,17

												Edit: As of the last year or so, Blackjacket has more or less abandoned this game, which is a shame.  Multiplayer is difficult to find if not nonexistent.  While you can still technically play it with bots for a lot of people it isn't as fun.  I will leave my review as stands because despite the tragedy of it being abandoned I still adore this game, and really wish that it can either be picked back up or that another game developer makes a similar style game.  This is a warning to anybody expecting to try and buy the game now; if you are looking for multiplayer, you will be disappointed.Metal Drift is honestly a jewel amidst broken glass; a diamond in the rough.  There are too few games of its caliber out in the general PC world anymore, and most are either too expensive, too limited in what they can provide, or too broken to even be worth playing, usually any number of the three mixed together.The general synopsis: Metal Drift is what I like to call Soccer with Tanks and Lasers.  You're given two teams; one blue, Athalon, and one red, Triax; and a ball in the center of the map.  Players grab the ball and try to take it to the enemy's base to goal...only it's not that simple.  Players can die and explode into bits and pieces, some players can be sneaky and use power-ups to one-side you.  As you play the game, you level up your skills and unlock different weapons and skills; from the starter auto-repair and basic blaster, to the all-powerful shock cannon and teleportation ability, there is a guarantee that there will be a specific ability and weapon combo that will fit your playstyle.Now, the pros and cons:Pros:+ Great narration/voice actor for narrating+ Awesome gameplay+ Great level variety+ Good graphics without the cost of a high pc; my craptop could run this smoothly at 4 years old.Cons:- AI has a tendency to gang up on you if you're closer than the bot with the ball- A very tiny playerbase...save for private communities there isn't much in the way of a playerbase.This game NEEDS to be more popular.  It is amazing, fun, and engrossing.  The fact that it looks like a really good game that easily trumps any full-price game of its caliber currently on the market, and costs much less as well, should make it a very popular title.  It's sad that nobody plays this besides the few private groups out there, and there needs to be more players.  I DEFINITELY, beyond a doubt, recommend this game to any passersby, just because of how fun it is.-Kerian			",139,24,1,20,13,2,34

Small community is the only issue.  so much fun to pilot these hover tanks and scoring goals is a thrilling accomplishment. even as a single player game, playing against bots that are customizable to suit your skill level, i have a lot of fun levelling up and unlocking new weapons and upgrades. makes me feel like im playing football in a tank. would have been an awesome sport. a friend got this for me as part of a four pack.

I've never seen anything of the sort before. No weapon and no upgrade gives you a definitive advantage. In fact, it's like Formula One: all vehicles are equal, and only your personal skills in driving define if you win or lose.Physics is intuitive, tanks are easy to control, and graphics is fine. My vision of indie games has changed forever.Give it a try, too, and maybe it will be your favourite as well.			",77,8,2,22,8,0,5

												The fast-paced, arena action of Metal Drift will easily satisfy your craving for a quick action game, and the multiplayer is phenomenal.  The graphics are nice and the framerate is steady.  The controls take some getting used to, but are actually quite good.  There's absolutely no story whatsoever in Metal Drift, but the announcer during games is actually more entertaining than you'd think.With 5 arenas, and a leveling system that allows players to unlock new weapons and tank upgrades, Metal Drift is an absolutely excellent first-person tank soccer sim.

												It's a mediocre sports game that only plays online... and there's nobody online to play it with.Hang around all day and you won't find a full server.

												This is an excellent game... by far the most rewarding in my collection. The controls are quite difficult to master, but I wouldn't have them any other way. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys an adrenalin rush, is capable of working as a team, and enjoys FPS games.Some others have complained of the levelling system; I think it's actually beneficial. Ensuring that noobs have to use easy-to-use weapons (e.g. being able to spray) and helpful abilities (like heal) means they're less likely to drag down their teams as they learn. It also gives a sense of satisfaction and purpose to the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Metal Drift is a seemingly still in beta game that could grow into something great if they would begin heading in a direction they haven't even started in yet. It's could be a mobile game on a high end phone to kill 15 minutes of time. There is bot/LAN modes that can be accessed only after logging into the games servers (with a username and password). After gettind used to the idea that you are piloting a tank and not a light cycle from Tron, you find yourself armed with a pea shooter cannon and confronting a rocket launching opposing team. When they say drift tank, they mean driffffffft until about an hour in when you master controls. The announcer was probably only in studio for roughly 10 minutes to VO some very repetitive commentary and some end of match plugs for the personal websites of the game's contributors.In all, try the demo. If you like it read the updates to see if you'll be getting anything more than the same.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I enjoy playing around on this with the bots from time to time. It's a challenge to stay alive, but the overall mechanics are really fun. There are some glitches with the hyperspace power-up, but aside from that, I dont really have any problems with it.It would be nice if this game had some more arena's to play in, some more hover ships, and maybe even the ablity to customize each ship, however one desires, with TONS of customization options. It wouldn't be so bad to include some more weapons either, not sure what though.I have never tried the multiplayer on it though, I DON'T know why, but I just haven't. Although, this would definately be more fun with actual human interaction. Hell, I think this game is ""Let's Play"" ready, and I'm very willing to create some ""Let's Play"" vids in this game. ^_^ I'm working on one right now, but it's a test video, because I'm testing out this capture program, and trying to understand how to do all of this stuff (i'm new to that kind of thing).Would DEFINATELY reccomend this game to eveyone who loves arena shooters, racing games, racing shooters, and anyone who loves to have a good time. I think even Rocket Leaguers would enjoy this title.			",87,4,1,4,6,0,0

												This game is AMAZING, it is fun for hours, honestly this is one of my favorate games. The gameplay is very simple to understand, work with your team to take the ball that spawns into the middle to the opposing teams goal, which is right next to their spawn point. This involves boosting, shooting, and dying a lot. Eat weapon is balanced, and has their own strengths and weaknesses, and so do the upgrades you unlock through gameplay experiance. Overall this game is extremely fun and exciting. However, what is most sad, is that this is an indie online only game, which almost condemns failure because of lack of player base. So there is almost always no one online. Like others I suggest you enjoy the game by buying the 4 pack and organising with your friends. I give the game 9/10			",137,27,5,22,14,2,13

												Amazing game! I have been playing off and on for almost 10 years now. I was part of the original yahoo group project for this game long before it ever hit steam. I have well over 200 hours in this game. Its rather sad there are not more players and the bots can be some what brain dead but the game is good and there are still players around from time to time. Its a good game for a good price.Well balanced and well polished for the small dev group that put it together. The account system came about a year or two after it launched on steam and  was ment to be a way of keeping track of your stats and level not a DRM.Too all the cry babies about having to singing up for account, suck it up cupcake.

												I could see this game being fun at a lan party or something but it has some issues it has to work out.First, When I loaded my first match, a lot of the textures did not load in for the map, so I could not see the walls and it made it very difficult to play.  I tried switching to lower graphics settings and that seemed to fix the problem.Second, about half of the time when trying to load a server, the game will flatout crash.  I'm not sure what's causing that but it seems inconsistent.  For example, I'll create a game and it will work just fine.  Then I'll create a game with the exact same settings, and the game will crash and require a restart.Third, I've played a bunch of matches, in which I have killed and scored plenty of times.  When I check on my  stats online, it says I have no kills, no goals scored etc.  Which is weird because it shows my level, which increases from playing matches, and its up to date with my current level.Fourth, Maybe you don't care about achievements, but because of the third reason I gave, it seems as though a lot of the achievements are failing to register.

												Metal Drift is an interesting concept that basically amounts to Capture the Flag, With Tanks. Even playing by myself most of the time it was a fun little game. Especially since many of the weapons force you to lead your target or otherwise calculate where they will be when your projectile arrives.The Bot AI wasn't anything real special however tending to have the habit or just zerging you constantly if you had the ball rather than doing any special manuvers or such. Though...it is still surprisingly effective.			",139,16,0,20,38,2,46

												Metal Drift may be small, but it's incredibly tight. It's like someone took Battlezone's agile hover tanks and stuck them in Hyperblade's extreme sports setting, giving you a variety of weapon and equipment options while they were at it. I'm always pleased when I can pick up a competive game and immediatelly excel above other entry-level players, though Metal Drift's tiny community means that you're always going to run into one of the few veterans, who will inevitably demonstrate why more people don't stick with weird little games like this. I encourage you to overcome the inherent butthurt in playing aginst such individuals and engage in a unique and thrilling multiplayer experience.			",332,6,5,16,2,1,15
