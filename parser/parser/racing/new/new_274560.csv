												Pretty much the only modern game even trying to replicate the execellence of Tyrian or Raptor. A recent patch (28 April 2015) addressed the early game slog by having the player start with a second weapon slot so there is at least a semblance of customization at the beginning.pros:-multiple weapons-actual hp bar so the game plays more like a shooter than a mouse avoider-online co-op multiplayercons:-waits way too long to actually unlock the 5 weapon slots and a good selection of weapons (it gets good, but still)-Tyrian is 10x better, if you haven't already played Tyrian so many times that you just can't play it any more go get it insteadVerdict:If you long for a Tyrian or Raptor styled game and have played out the old classics, get this.

												This game is a must for people who like shooters with an army-style. The style of the game is there are two types of targets: Ground and Air, which can give extra challenge if you're not careful with the situation. There is a shop to spend your scrap collected through the levels for weapons, levels to unlock perks and weapon slots, and even a versus mode. For those who want simplicity or simplicity with a little more on a shooter, this game should be in your collection.Pros:-You don't die in one hit. You have two things: Shield that regenerates and protects your health, and health.-Shop to buy new weapons and equip-Perks(buffs) that you get when you level up.Cons:-A bit tough at the beginning on killing enemies, but at least it walks you through on situations.

												Revolution Ace was an interesting attempt to build a shmup in the Unreal Engine, which was not at all designed for the purpose.  The resulting game isn't a disaster, but neither is it a compelling success.The appeal of shmup games typically comes from hectic action; your weapons are typically devastating, killing the weakest foes in one hit, and your fire rate is intense.  Challenge in a shmup typically comes not from any deficiency of your avatar, but the sheer numbers of enemies it sends at you, the intensity of their fire, and the speed at which they move.Revolution Ace departs radically from that standard shmup formula.  You and the majority of your foes move slowly, even sluggishly.  Your weapons are uncharacteristically weak, requiring a good second or so of concentrated fire to take down most normal opponents, who are comparatively few in number.  Instead of a hyperkinetic frenzy of ducking and weaving through enemy fire while opponents explode in dramatic fireballs all around you, Revolution Ace feels more like a slow, stubborn push through the enemy forces, hoping to make it through to the final boss before your armor is depleted.The addition of true 3D modeling, switchable air/ground fire and recharging shield to the genre are interesting, but don't really make up for the loss of the speed and destructiveness that is the hallmark of this style of gameplay.

 The RundownRevolution Ace is definitely NOT one of the best shooters in its genre. It has frame rate problems, the bullets blend in with the background, and generally it's a bit of a mess. But somehow when I was playing it, something made me look past all that and I really did have a good time. It has an upgrade system that definitely helps with the sense of progression, a fun but challenging boss at the end of each stage, and a neat system of air bullets vs ground bullets, forcing you to pick between whether you're shooting in the background or in the foreground. But by far the best part of the game is the multiplayer. It takes all the problems I mentioned and kinda blurs them out of your mind, because, at least for me, I was more focused on playing a game with my friend and the issues became less glaring. There's also a cool multiplayer versus mode, which I've never seen implimented into a top-down shooter before. It works pretty well.As a whole, Revolution Ace was like a fat guy sitting in front of you at a playoff game. It's annoying at first, sure, but if you can look past the problems, you have a great game in front of you. It's a fun experience, and you should definitely consider picking it up if you have some friends to play it with. Pros Upgrades system Interactive environments Interesting air vs ground mechanics Great multiplayerCons Frame rate issues Bullets tend to blend in with the background Lasts maybe a bit longer than it needs to ",168,45,3,18,11,1,13

Builds on the foundation of the old and classic with fresh novelty // Recommended for those of inventive mind and quick reflexes~Full Disclosure: This game was reviewed with a key given by the developers~+ Missed enemies that return for a second pass are highlighted, indicating a drop in value; this is a useful feature that encourages target prioritization, although this feature (strangely) seemed to make few appearances after the first level+ User interface, while not aesthetically sensational, is functional and unobtrusive+ A combination of unlockable perks, a straightforward leveling system, and myriad upgrade components available for purchase make for a refreshing level of customization+ Gameplay and ship customization does much to reward forward-planning and a tactical mind-set+ Boasts an attention to detail uncommon for the genre, such as ripple effects when firing into bodies of water, or trees being felled when strafed by machine gun fire+ Though few people seem to be taking advantage of it at the moment, the multiplayer is excellent; in particular, the 'Battle Chains' option is absolutely ingenious, and incredibly addicting (this mode lets the player run through a stage, then challenge a friend to the same stage, at which point their progress will be compared to yours and a return challenge issued, building to potentially better and better matches)+ The combination of air/ground combat is a breath of fresh air for the genre, and adds immensely to the challenge+ Agreeably lengthy campaign for an arcade shooter - not too long, not too short+ Healthy variety of enemy units that introduce new patterns and weaponry, building on top of those from previous stages, keeping the game fresh throughout+ Between ship modules and unlockable perks, the number of combinations at your disposal for tackling enemy units is staggering+ Visuals are par-for-the-course; they are a bit lacking by today's standards, but they are far from disappointing- There are occasional, and seemingly random drops in frame-rate (although they are, admittedly, very minor drops, and more casual players are unlikely to be offset by it)- Music, while not inherently terrible, suffers from a lack of variety; none of the scores really stand out, and they quickly fade into the background during gameplay (sound effects, also, were somewhat uninspired)- No aesthetic customization options; this wouldn't normally count against the game but, as there is otherwise an overwhelming emphasis on ship customization, this ended up standing out as a mild disappointment- While there is a plot, it's poorly presented, and it's clear that there was minimal effort put into it, whatsoever; there may as well have not been one includedLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit ",195,26,1,22,22,0,22

												An OK upstart of a game, but...1. Difficulty is all over the place. Even on easy it gets unenjoyable - fast.2. The game tries to be a lot like ""Raptor: The Call of Shadows"", a true classic. Tries, and fails miserably. You do get a shop for changing loadouts, you do get a smartypants shop owner, you do get a plane with shields, you do get the top-down scrolling... and not much else.3. Weapons are ridiculously underpowered, requiring a lot of stay-on-target time.4. The game still requires polishing, even without the balance issues. Music lags constantly in all the menus, sound design is mediocre at best, and it all requires an old version of nVidia PhysX just to run (builldings falling into pieces? planes dropping out of the sky? we could do without it at no gaming experience lost).All in all, a disappointment. Even if you see it at a bragain price somewhere, bear in mind that it might be not worth your time. Pick Jets'n'Guns instead if you really are a SHMUP fan.			",197,33,1,29,6,0,20

												Revolution Ace is a shoot 'em up game that takes inspiration from the classics.My favorite thing about it so far is the fact that there is room for customization, maybe not right at the beginning but with the inclusion of perks I'm free to make my jet fighter thing the way I want to! I get to play in my own unique way and so does every other player.  The UI and soundtrack are good for what they are and I didn't run into any flaws minor or major, and the levels are interesting enough to keep me playing, though not distracting me from the gameplay. The enemies all have something that is unique about them and all have different patterns, because of this the screen can become a cluster of enemies and bullets if you're not fast enough at clearing them out, so watch the shield regen.Speaking of shield, missed enemies do come back so sometimes if you missed an enemy or two you won't have the opportunity to regenerate your shield in an area that otherwise would've been clear, so if this happens you'll be left in a situation where you're being attacked without shields, which adds to the intensity to the gameplay.My only gripe with the game is that the bosses are too easy and too predictable, at least in the few first stages.I recommend this game and shout-outs to senpai studios for giving me a free key for this game.

												As a kid, I enjoyed playing games like Tiger Heli on the NES. This top-down, side scrolling gem brings us back to those days, but with a modern twist. Not only are the graphics decent for a 2D top-down, but you can collect scrap which is then used to purchase upgrades for your ship, making you a true Ace of the skies. Fight against entire air forces in campaign mode, play with friends in a co-op game, or choose skirmishes and dogfight it out with both air and ground targets, Revolution Ace also allows you to pit your skills against other players, in side-by-side, split screen fashion. A great buy at a relatively low price, with progressively difficult settings to give you a challenge, This is a pretty good gem I would recommend.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												So, I was gifted a copy of this from the developers publicist in exchange for a fair and honest review.I've put about an hour into it so far, which given the nature of the game seems like a reasonable amount of time to draw some conclusions. I will update this review if I reach different conclusions later.Anyway, this game seems fairly accessible at first. It is a pretty basic shmup that also later on features some lite bullet hell aspects. The actual movement of your ship is a little slow, and at first, your weapons arent very powerful either. However, as you gain credits via finishing missions and generally blowing stuff up, you can buy upgrades to your weaponry and shields that make this a bit more effective and a bit easier EXCEPT the games difficulty scales more quickly than you can upgrade, and so this actually becomes a pretty challenging game after the first couple missions. I'm level 7 right now and have wrapped up something like 8 or 10 missions so far. At this point, I'm dying pretty quickly even after my upgrades (which you can swap out between missions as well btw) and even though powerups are readily available. Still, I havent reached the point of frustration yet, as I feel the right combo of upgrades is really all it takes to get past the levels despite the fact that they seem scaled beyond your present capabilities as you progress.As you level up, you also occasionally earn perks, which are basically permanent upgrades to your ship. There is actually a wide variety to choose from, so you will need to choose wisely here. The graphics are pretty much on par with what you expect. They arent mind blowing, but they do look nice and fairly well represent the genre and the era the game hearkens back to. Speaking of....the music is also well in line with this. It gets a bit repetitive but still remains listenable throughout.All told, I would normally give this about a 5.5 out of 10. However, the game is presently featured for under 30 cents, and it has trading cards as well, the value of which pretty much are equal to the cost of the game. So...despite the 5.5 out of 10, it's still pretty much a must own if you make use of the marketplace...and lets be real...for 30 cents or so, you will end up owning this at some point anyway.

												Revolution Ace is a top down Shmup in where you fight enemies from both the air and the ground simultaneously. There are two keys that fires your weapons. One is to aim your projectiles in front of you and the other to fire at the ground below you. It can be confusing to tell on what plane an enemy is on and I would often times find myself shooting over an enemy. After a bit of practice and knowledge of the enemy it becomes a non-issue. Before getting to the gameplay you may want to tweak around with the graphic settings but be warned, turning on CSAA anti-aliasing will immediately crash the game for some reason. There are four modes in this title. Campaign provides a story and unlocks more levels for the other modes, Skirmish is to replay any mission you want and even some exclusive ones and versus has you and another player going through the same mission competing for score while introducing some new power-ups that hinders your opponent.The last mode is called BattleChain that works similarly to versus though you play alone and later send the ghost data of your playthrough to the person you challenge. Campaign mode is where you'll want to start as it does it's best to introduce you to the mechanics of this game. The story of Revolution Ace has an interesting beginning in which the nations of the world built machines to fight their wars instead of wasting any human lives and the robots eventually stop fighting each other to launch a devastating attack against humanity. It has a very interesting premise but goes nowhere as they went for the “funny redneck” vaguely explains what you are doing on each mission route. No one expects a story from a Shmup though it did feel rather disappointing to start off with one and promptly forget about it. Throughout every mission you will be facing a horde of hostile robots in your cheap cobbled together jet in a last ditch attempt to retaliate against the enemy. It starts off as a suicide mission though after many successes you start gathering scrap that allows you to build much better equipment on your craft.The more enemies you destroy the more scrap you collect once successfully completing a mission. You get much more scrap if you kill an enemy before it leaves the screen. If it leaves and comes back for a second barrage it will be worth far less. Scrap will be the most important thing in this game since Revolution Ace features RPG like progression in where newer unlocked weapons you can buy in the armory are better in every way compared to your meager starting equipment. You also level up by gaining experience and unlike scraps you still get experience even if you fail the mission. Leveling up sometimes means that you get to choose from one of many perks that increase damage for a certain weapon type, allows your shields to recharge faster and one that increases your overall health to name a few. Sometimes instead of being able to choose from perks while leveling up you will instead have new equipment available to buy in the Armory. You will be needing all the help you can get as this game is brutal and I barely managed to beat it even while playing through the entire game with someone else.This would be a good time to mention the online multiplayer. It is great and I couldn't notice any lag or hiccups during 6 or so hours of playtime on two very poor internet connections. I wish more shumps would include online play as most have the option for two players but many of us can't take advantage of it. Funny that a 2 dollar game should include it and it's a feature I must applaud. This is one of the most graphically impressive shmups on the market as it runs on Unreal Engine 3 and features cool effects such as the water rippling when shot at as well as fancy explosions. It is a very nice looking game but there is nothing interesting to look at as most of the game is either in a bland desert, the sky or over water. Enemy designs are decent though this is where the game suffers the most due to the RPG system of this game. From start to finish the enemies felt very bullet spongy making the combat feel unsatisfying and utterly devoid of any flow as you spend way too much time on a single enemy while there are dozens more coming for you.That makes it feel like a game designed around grinding instead of skill. It is possible to beat the game without any grinding, however bullet spongy enemies make it tedious task. Leveling up also unlocks weapon slots for your ship allowing you to place a few more guns on the side of it to shoot horizontally. You unlock the left weapon slot first and it takes quite a while to unlock the one on the right side making it feel like very artificial progression. We are the last hope to destroy the robot menace and the mechanic won't install another gun on your preferred side of the ship because we are not level 18? The RPG features of this game aren't subjectively bad as those that like the feeling of becoming more powerful and being able to take on more difficult tasks are sure to enjoy it but for those of us that prefer Shmups to have everything we need to stand a chance from the get go and skill being the determining factor in whether we are victorious or a pile of debris on the floor.Weapons variants range from bullets, lasers and explosives. Each unlocked weapon has different effects even if they are the same variant so make sure to carefully read the description as some weapons can't be shoot at ground enemies. Fighting ground enemies is kind of clunky as you have some type of auto lock feature while shooting at the ground so you may fire at the wrong target from time to time. It is very cool seeing a buggy riding around down in a desert shooting up at you and those add some strategy to game as you decide whether to fight the enemies in front of you or the ones below you. The projectiles on screen are shot by the dozens and is near bullet hell levels of crazy. Unlike Bullet Hells your ship's hitbox is pretty huge here and you can take quite a bit of punishment before meeting your demise. You have both a shield and hull health to protect you from exploding. It doesn't matter much if the shield takes damage as not firing your weapons will recharge its energy back, hull health on the other hand you do not want to take any damage to . The only way to heal hull health is via a semi-rare powerup that enemies drop and if your shields are completely down that means things have gone really wrong.Shields can also be bought and replaced with different types such as ones that take more damage but recharge slower. The whole not shooting to recharge your shields gimmick is rather weird and will more often than not cause you to get overwhelmed as more enemies enter the fray. It makes for some rather intense moments where you have a split second to decide if you stop firing and try to hold out until some of your shield is recharged or to hold your ground and risk it all. These moments would be a lot more fun if the enemies weren't so bullet spongy and you could go out in a blaze of glory though there is no denying it will still have you on the edge of your seat. One complaint I have regarding projectiles is that some enemies shoot dark brown projectiles that are really hard to see in most cases. There is also this weird gimmick in where your ship randomly rises higher to the sky or lower in certain set points of the level. Bosses are giant enemies be they fortresses or battleships that will do everything it can to shoot you down. It is rather cool seeing them get desperate as their health is low and launching an all-out barrage of projectiles. In the end of the day this is a content packed shmup with online coop, some levels in Skrimish mode that randomly generate the game and many handmade missions to blast your way through. It is by no means a game that will take the world by storm but for its low price this is a game that any fan of the Shmups should at least take a look at.			",1866,546,60,204,165,17,226

												A truly fantastic nostalgia trip back to the world of jet fighter games.Had a brill run through on this game, got to Campaign +2 in about 10 hours, then went ahead and started challenging people. If anyone has played the SNES game Super Strike Gunner, then this game is for you, it feels exactly the same as SSG did when I played it all those years ago.There are some very nice ideas in this game, the verses and battle modes where you can compete against players are very fun indeed, along with the customizing of your aircraft, perk system, leveling system and NG+, it does give the game some replay-ability, although when you reach later levels (20+), I found the game just turned into level-grinding to get those extra perk levels. There are some arguably minor bad points I got from this however, the main one being how short the game actually is. While I personally don't mind a nice casual game to pass the time, a little more content and a more challenging difficulty would have helped a bit, (you can easily go straight to the highest difficulty setting and ace the game).Another point I would like to mention is how easy the achievements are to get, while some may see this as a good thing, some hunters might not enjoy the lack of challenge in acquiring the full set of achievements, again though I think this is more about personal preference than anything.Overall I was very happy with the game, even at full price I would have still bought this when it came under my radar, so 96% off was a total bargain for me. Putting the minor issues aside, I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a nice casual game of this genre without a doubt, especially if you enjoyed SSG and the like all those years ago.In conclusion, my personal rating for Revolution Ace is :8.5/10 ",369,84,12,51,35,2,58

												Later on, mankind uses AI driven machines to wage war, yet this invert releases when the machines turn on their masters. To fight this risk, your top of the line pilot takes to the sky in an old travel to counter. The machines are summoning the land, sea and air so your battle won't be straightforward. At first I felt that Change Expert didn't much issue with a story as the elucidation for why you are controlling an old stream against bleeding edge foes is simply revealed several levels into the beguilement. It doesn't have any kind of effect nonetheless, as no reason is relied upon to partake in some old school, level shooting movement. Disregarding the Shocking Engine controlled visuals, Change Master seems like it was detached straight from a nineties arcade machine. Unmistakably time has been spent on making the ground look fascinating with effects like trees affecting in the wind and mountains that climb up into the screen however the general effect is somewhat frustrating. It could just be my own slants, however the sensible style visuals essentially look a touch too much troubling for an over the top style entertainment like Bombshell Expert. I can't accuse the contrasting qualities in any case, as the delight takes you transversely over unsettled areas, mountains and oceans, with a couple levels shrouded in haze or solicited in snow. There are irrefutably minutes where the diversion benefits look and there is emphatically no nonattendance of enemies to shoot at, yet there is nothing that really isolates the visuals from the pack. Change Master is a genuinely coordinate shooter, yet there are a few novel things that make it worth a minute look. Firstly, enemies attack from both the air and ground and you use two separate fire gets to attract them. Weaving through shots while shooting on the right plane can be questionable at in any case, yet it soon ends up being second nature. Completing levels compensate you with experience centers and shrapnel. Experience centers are tallied up to fabricate the level of your fly, which prompts to prizes, for instance, more weapon spaces, new weapons and a liven of your choice. The preferences keep running from better covering to speedier slugs or strong laser and there are lacking levels to pick each one of them so you have to pick carefully. The shrapnel is your cash and is used to purchase the programmed rifles, rockets and bar firearms and moreover shields and exceptional strikes that make your specialty so significant. There are more than 20 weapons to peruse and the position on your fly matters which makes it diverting to mix and match to see what the results are. The campaign mode felt to some degree longer than what you generally find in the class and upon fulfillment you can start a harder, New+ playthrough. There are similarly three inconvenience settings to give everyone a sensible shot at beating the entertainment. Enemies attack in substantial numbers and on Run of the mill or higher, the ones that you miss returns for another go, however the way that you have a shield and protective layer meter makes things stunningly less requesting. Shooters with one hit executes can perplex, so Uprising Master is a conventional introduction to the class that won't drive off newcomers. If you understand blazed on the fight mode or feel like you need some extra experience and shrapnel you can explore different avenues regarding the Engagement mode. In Struggle you find the opportunity to pick a level from any of the ones that you have viably opened to practice or farm experience and shrapnel. Fundamentally more fun is the Versus mode where you play one beside the other with another player and can mess up their entertainment by sending enemies to their side of the screen. The Battle Chains mode works the same as Versus however rather than playing against some individual dynamically you challenge their recordings. If you complete the test you can send it back to the principal player who then need to fight with all the extra tumult that you brought on in the midst of your playthrough. The test increment quickly and this mode can end up being exceptionally addictive, however finding diverse players is not that basic right at this point. I had a lot of fun with Change Master however this may be a result of me playing shooters since the start of the arcades. More up and coming players might be less thoughtful about the dull visuals and rather non particular sound. The controls regardless, are responsive and the preoccupation most likely packs a test, however isolated from the versus modes it doesn't by and large rise up out of the pack. I really favored the thought so in a perfect world LGG can make a turn off, which genuinely increment the era values. (All overviews are recuperated from the Internet and channeled through a movement of equal word gadgets three times both for unreasonableness and to extra time. In my religion, this is known as Art(TM), in any case you can call it ""Threewording"") ",324,44,31,27,29,2,48

												This game is just.... awesome!Bear with me now and let me explain. First of all the trailers on the store page dont do justice to the game at all. I bought this one by just looking at price. Turns out it's as good or in some areas even better than Jets'n'Guns which is my favorite shooter. Did not expect this at all from such a simple looking shooter. A bit about the mechanics: game has a leveling system and scrap (money) you get from doing missions, multiplayer battle challenges etc. With these goodies you buy new gear and in the spirit of Jets'n'Guns it is pretty much mandatory to test things out and find the best setups. Skirmish missions can be done if you wish to grind for some extra scrap. Configurations do matter as the Campaign start becoming harder bit by bit but the real test are the awesome battle chains where you or someone lays out a challenge to others in form of a level completion replay. Others will try to beat your score and you will see in a replay how they did it. Fun starts when someone rips the score so high you really have to think how will i beat this. You might need to re-think your setup to beat the score. (Your opponent see how many times you tried to beat his score so dont humiliate yourself too much by trying a strategy that just doesnt work)  Eventually the score will climb very high as the same challenge is bounced back and forth until either side just gives up.  Multiplayer system is very good - though be warned that it is quite confusing to use at first.  Check forums.Game also sports a interesting notification system where you get a message to your steam notifications bar that someone has beaten your score and it's your turn to try to beat the opponents score. In order to not just praise the game there is a bit of criticism too: Lack of feedback everywhere is annoying. menus are unresponsive for some time too yet not greyed out. In missions hitting targets does not yield much of reaction. i'd also like to see a bit more animation frames on certain enemies for a more flowing visual game experience. And just what are those really tiny white walkers that fire missiles at you? No big things but give a rough feeling to the game.			",775,311,45,87,97,7,148

												Pretty much the only modern game even trying to replicate the execellence of Tyrian or Raptor. A recent patch (28 April 2015) addressed the early game slog by having the player start with a second weapon slot so there is at least a semblance of customization at the beginning.pros:-multiple weapons-actual hp bar so the game plays more like a shooter than a mouse avoider-online co-op multiplayercons:-waits way too long to actually unlock the 5 weapon slots and a good selection of weapons (it gets good, but still)-Tyrian is 10x better, if you haven't already played Tyrian so many times that you just can't play it any more go get it insteadVerdict:If you long for a Tyrian or Raptor styled game and have played out the old classics, get this.

												This game is a very nice shoot'em up ! It's easy to pick up, and yet hard to master, but very enjoyable if you like old-school shoot'em up.The difficulty is fairly balanced, and you can improve your weapons (by buying some more at the armory) so you can keep up with the waves of ennemies coming at you !If you're skilled enough you can finish the campaign quickly, but then you can try the skirmish mode or increase the difficulty to find more challenge.All in all, it's very fun if you've got a few minutes to spare, or an hour to grind.You can also try a well-thought multiplayer that allows you to send challenges to people around the world, and they can try to beat your score.Pros +- Easy to pick-up- Interesting concept of both ennemies on the ground and in air- Old school- Customization of your arsenal- Several tactics and playstyles depending on what wepaons and perks you choose- Interesting delayed multiplayer challenges- Controller support- Skill-based- CheapCons -- Old school- Graphics (not bad, but not so appealing)- Repetitive			",243,26,1,20,20,0,27

												+ Retro, top down, arcade shooter+ Mouse or keyboard gives you differing play style+ Good weapon selection, actively makes you feel more powerful+ Sound is decent with explosions and gunfire+ You get rewards for partial level completion+ Multiplayer options+ Devs are addressing issues and making improvements~ Enemies use the same attack patterns~ Graphics are somewhat low-fi~ Some bullet hell mixed in- Sudden ramps in difficulty- Random mouse lag in the menu screenFull disclosure, was given a key to review the game. While top-downs were never my fave genre I'd sling a  few quid into an arcade at the local chippy while waiting for my order and this game takes me right back. The retro graphics could use a polish but then it does capture the feel of arcades of the 2000's well. The mechanics and weapons are fun to try and every time you fly you progress.Conclusion: 7/10. As a work in progress it's worth a budget price.			",683,272,20,84,61,7,96

												January 12, 2017This is a basic Shoot 'Em Up, I played through the entire campaign in Co-op with a friend. We also did a couple of random missions for more cash and xp to upgrade our ships. We bought this game on sale for CDN$ 0.25.THE GOOD:-The weapons are pretty diverse and all work differently, from homing rockets to sweeping beams.-The perks system allows you to customize ur ship even more, with bonus damage to bullet guns and stuff like regenerating shield on plasma weapon kills.-I didnt have any performance issues.-The enemies had a lot of variety.-Both ground and air targets make for a more interesting gameplay.-Easy co-op joining with the steam friend list.THE UGLY:-The random missions are... random. From bosses spawning off screen to insanely hard levels.-Not enough unique bosses and most of them just dont move and throw bunch of ♥♥♥♥ at you with turrets.-After each campaign mission the 2nd player has to manually rejoin the lobby of the host.-The game has a ""Game Launcher"" that serves no purpose at all.-No color customization can make it hard to recognize which ship you are.TLDR: We had fun with our time with this little game, it was fun for a 25 cent game.Considering the price: 7/10			",327,74,7,49,33,4,68

If this type of game interest you, then this is hands down the best nineteen cents you can spend on Steam. It is easy to control, easy to learn, and easy to play, yet it is still very fun.

												A fresh modern american styled shmup with online co-op. Online Co-op! More shmups need to be on steam and they also need to have online co-op.Very good upgrades and weapons customization. Your ship has slots in which you can stick weapons wherever you want. Look at the community hub for screenshots of the shop. You can place weapons on the wings to shoot sideways. You have ""scrap"" (money for shop), experience points for leveling up your rank (which opens more weapon slots), and perks.The levels move slow and it may seem like a walk in the park towards the beginning, but don't let that fool you since you can find yourself easily overwhelmed all of a sudden. It's not a ""bullet hell game"" since there aren't 1000 bullets on the screen, but that doesn't mean you won't run into a bullet infested screen. This is definitely apparent in the later levels. The level of challenge is perfect with this one. It's not too easy and it's not too hard to make you stop playing altogether.Besides it having campaign co-op, you can split-screen battle a friend to see who ends up with the higher score. There are a few power-ups specific that appear in this mode which will affect the other player. It can either be positive or negative so that you don't just grab every one you see.You have one life to beat a level, but you have two lifebars. One of them recharges when you stop shooting and once the other one is depleted, you die. Very neat feature.Bottom line: If you're into shumps, this one needs to be in your library.

												In the future, humanity uses AI driven machines to wage war, but this backfires when the machines turn on their masters. To combat this threat, your elite pilot takes to the sky in an old jet to retaliate. The machines are dominating the land, sea and air so your battle will not be easy.At first I thought that Revolution Ace didn’t even bother with a story as the explanation for why you are piloting an old jet against futuristic foes is only revealed a few levels into the game. It doesn’t matter though, as no excuse is needed to engage in some old school, horizontal shooting action. Despite the Unreal Engine powered visuals, Revolution Ace looks like it was ripped straight out of a nineties arcade machine. It is clear that time has been spent on making the ground look interesting with effects like trees swaying in the wind and mountains that rise up into the screen but the overall effect is a bit underwhelming. It could just be my personal preferences, but the realistic style visuals just look a tad too drab for an over the top style game like Revolution Ace.I can’t fault the diversity though, as the game takes you across jungles, mountains and oceans, with some levels shrouded in mist or covered in snow. There are definitely moments where the game does look good and there is certainly no lack of enemies to shoot at, but there is nothing that really sets the visuals apart from the pack.Revolution Ace is a pretty straightforward shooter, but there are a couple of unique things that make it worth a second look. Firstly, enemies attack from both the air and ground and you use two separate fire buttons to engage them. Weaving through bullets while shooting on the correct plane can be tricky at first, but it soon becomes second nature. Completing levels reward you with experience points and shrapnel. Experience points are tallied up to increase the level of your jet, which leads to rewards such as more weapon slots, new weapons and a perk of your choice. The perks range from better armor to faster bullets or strong laser and there are not enough levels to choose all of them so you have to pick carefully. The shrapnel is your currency and is used to purchase the machine guns, missiles and beam cannons as well as shields and special attacks that make your craft so formidable. There are more than 20 weapons to choose from and the placement on your jet matters which makes it fun to mix and match to see what the results are.The campaign mode felt a bit longer than what you usually find in the genre and upon completion you can start a tougher, New+ playthrough. There are also three difficulty settings to give everyone a fair chance at beating the game. Enemies attack in droves and on Normal or higher, the ones that you miss comes back for another go, but the fact that you have a shield and armor meter makes things considerably easier. Shooters with one hit kills can be frustrating, so Revolution Ace is a nice introduction to the genre that won’t scare away newcomers.If you tire of the campaign mode or feel like you need some extra experience and shrapnel you can try out the Skirmish mode. In Skirmish you get to pick a level from any of the ones that you have already unlocked to practice or farm experience and shrapnel. Much more fun is the Versus mode where you play side by side with another player and can mess up their game by sending enemies to their side of the screen. The Battle Chains mode works the same as Versus but instead of playing against someone in real-time you challenge their recordings. If you complete the challenge you can send it back to the original player who then have to contend with all the added mayhem that you caused during your playthrough. The challenge ramps up quickly and this mode can become quite addictive, but finding other players is not that easy at the moment.I had a lot of fun with Revolution Ace but this may be due to me playing shooters since the early days of the arcades. Newer players might be less forgiving about the bland visuals and rather generic audio. The controls however, are responsive and the game certainly packs a challenge, but apart from the versus modes it doesn’t really stand out from the pack. I really liked the concept so hopefully LGG can create a sequel, which really ramps up the production values.			",217,62,8,24,14,3,18

Thanks to my good friend, LockeProposal of the highly insightful Curator Page named LockeProposal’s Big Day Out, I was able to take a look into this-aptly labeled-bullet hell title. At first glance, Revolution Ace is simplistic yet charming, with simple graphics and exciting gameplay even on the lowest of difficulties. After completing the first level, however, I knew I was in for a wild ride similar to that of Tyrian (as you will see this title being compared to all over the internet, and for good reason.) I do have a few offline hours in this game, so please do not be evaded by my lack of logged time.Here are some things that really caught my eye when starting up and throughout:Graphics - I’m not really a stickler when it comes to graphics, so some of the simpler textures in this game didn’t bother me; I actually enjoyed how the game presents itself, as it is pretty much all you would need from a game of this caliber. Besides, why bump everything into the graphics when the only thing you will be looking out for is enemy fire? All joking aside, the graphics in this title actually surprised me, looking into how the defeated enemies scar the landscape and at the intriguing water physics. I understand some individuals are only interested in games that present themselves with AAA graphics, but that mindset should really be looked past with this title.Controls - From the beginning, you are presented with two modes of fire: air-vs-air and air-vs-ground. These two modes of fire can be accessed separately by clicking LMB or RMB, respectively, but can be remapped if needed. Movement remains standard in Revolution Ace, with your classic WASD keys or Arrow keys representing the various direction. I know I cannot speak for everyone with this, but the craft in this title controls quite nicely as dodging enemy fire while utilizing quick reflexes becomes more important as you progress. You will learn what MMB is used for later. I don’t want to spoil the fun.Gameplay - There’s a reason it’s called bullet hell. Revolution Ace is a side-scrolling (for lack of better terms) shooter with the objective of scoring enough points to ultimately better your ship and-subsequently-bring more pain to the bombarding enemy forces. As stated previously, the ship controls nicely from my perspective and the gunplay is fantastic. What I found of particular interest (described in the next segment) was the customization, which allows you to upgrade specific components of your ship to fit the scheme of play you want. For instance, do you want to stick to the classic missiles and guns on your ship and use the basic shield? or would you prefer utilizing an automated laser turret mounted on your craft with a chain-gun mounted on front and heat-seeking missiles primarily for enemy aircrafts?Upgrade/Customization System - Here’s where the game really shines. Remember the mention of only starting with a basic gun, missiles, and shield? As you progress through the campaign, both Experience and Scrap Points-which acts as a currency-are gained. Starting at an early level, ship upgrades-such as improving damage by 10% as your ship drops below 25% hull-can be chosen to better customize your level of play; be warned that once you select a ‘Perk’ you cannot reselect, though you gain more as you progress. Along with these permanent upgrades, you also unlock Slots on your ship, which allow for even more guns and other attachments-such as the aforementioned automated laser turret. From where I am in the game, this system of upgrades and customization has really impressed me, as I have been intrigued enough to switch my style of play so that I can buy different weapons. What also sets this system apart from others is that each gun, though different, is necessarily better than another so it really just depends on how you use each one. Did I mention there are things known as Super Weapons that can be used when clicking MMB and are cooldown based? Those are also really fun.TL:DR - There may be things I left out, but I have not been able to play the various game modes as of recent, which-by concept-are very intriguing. Though I did not mention it in the base review, I did enjoy the fact that there are no Achievements in the game pertaining to beating the Campaign at multiple difficulty settings, which allows the player to go at their own pace. At this stage, I’d highly recommend Revolution Ace for its fast-paced, over-the-top gameplay. Just remember: you will get hit. A lot. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews?

			My review of ""Revolution Ace"", an arcade jet fighter game developed and published by Laser Guided Games. ------------------------------- Like on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/EnjoyTheGaming...		

Game: Revolution AceGenre: Arcade Jet FighterDeveloper: Laser Guided Games Publisher: Laser Guided Games Copy supplied by developerRevolution Ace is an arcade jet fighter game developed and published by Laser Guided Games.GRAPHICSThe game, developed with Unreal Engine 3, looks just fine: there is a good amount of particle effects, enemy variety and high-quality textures, but, as with many of these games, the background gets really repetitive really fast. Still, the performance is quite good, with solid 60fps even with multiple explosions on the screen.GAMEPLAYYou control a customizable ship, and your objective is to get to the end of each map and defeat the boss. There are two types of attack: one to destroy flying vehicles and bombs, the other to destroy land vehicles and enemy bases. You can also acquire powerups and new weapons (as well as ship upgrades)through the shop using the money and XP that you gain at the end of each level.If you like this genre, you will love this game: it is formulaic but fun. If you never liked this type of games when they were popular in the arcades, I find it hard that you will enjoy it now.CHALLENGEThe game is very challenging on every difficulty setting, and it can get really frustrating the more you play it: sometimes dodging enemy fire seems impossible, and some of the boss fights will require more luck than actual skills.SOUNDThe sound effects are very good and each weapon and ship has its unique sounds. The soundtrack fits the game and, while it is forgettable, it does give you enough strength to keep going.REPLAYABILITYEven though there is small amount of Steam achievements (only 19), multiple difficulty settings, online leaderboards, local and online multiplayer will keep you coming back to this game more than once.While it lacks in a story and the gameplay is very formulaic, there is much to enjoy in this game and you will spend mutliple hours trying to improve your ship and get higher scores. I highly recommend this game to fans of the genre and to those looking for a challenge. If you are new to the genre, I recommend waiting for it to go on sale.Story: n/a

												The general idea and systems are great. The scrap system with unlocking weapons slots is works well. The regularly upgrading item shop will keep you changing out and trying new equipment each level. The sheild system is one of the best Ive seen in this type of game. It also sports a cool perk system which allows you to further customize the experience. While the technical and paper design is fairly strong, where the game falls short is the execution. The UI is challenging and you will more than likely accidentaly purchase a weapon twice or salvage something you want before fully understanding  the shop/equip menu. The art is quite bad overall with uninspiring visual designs in enemies, VFX and environment. There are a few really good boss encounters and some of the enemy patterns keep the gameplay feeling somewhat unique throughout.  The majority of the regular enemies and the bulk of levels are fairly bland and the pacing feels flat. There are very few highs and lows which makes the game start to feel boring too quickly.  Ground enemies shoot up at you and its very unclear when you will get hit so it can feel cheap at certain points. Overall: Good design + Mediocre gameplay execution + Bellow par visuals.  I will give this a very soft thumbs up, but I only reccomend this game to hardcore vertical shooter fans that have a lot of free time on their hands.			",796,214,20,87,46,3,99

												This game isn't the prettiest of 'em all. In fact it's more like ""Brienne of Tarth"" of shoot 'em ups. But if you can look past the poor visuals - some qualities await you. The qualities being:Solid, fast paced gameplay.Great progression system, including ship upgrades, leveling up and some sort of skill tree (being depicted as a simple list, though).Surprising and interesting visual effects that get the job done pretty well, despite being of mediocre quality.All in all, a fun shmup worth playing. It's now for €0.19 which is hilarious. I'm not sure I'd be completely happy if I got it at full price, but any reasonable discount should justify the purchase.			",136,23,4,15,5,0,11

												The general idea and systems are great. The scrap system with unlocking weapons slots is works well. The regularly upgrading item shop will keep you changing out and trying new equipment each level. The sheild system is one of the best Ive seen in this type of game. It also sports a cool perk system which allows you to further customize the experience. While the technical and paper design is fairly strong, where the game falls short is the execution. The UI is challenging and you will more than likely accidentaly purchase a weapon twice or salvage something you want before fully understanding  the shop/equip menu. The art is quite bad overall with uninspiring visual designs in enemies, VFX and environment. There are a few really good boss encounters and some of the enemy patterns keep the gameplay feeling somewhat unique throughout.  The majority of the regular enemies and the bulk of levels are fairly bland and the pacing feels flat. There are very few highs and lows which makes the game start to feel boring too quickly.  Ground enemies shoot up at you and its very unclear when you will get hit so it can feel cheap at certain points. Overall: Good design + Mediocre gameplay execution + Bellow par visuals.  I will give this a very soft thumbs up, but I only reccomend this game to hardcore vertical shooter fans that have a lot of free time on their hands.			",796,214,20,87,46,3,99

												Great game.The graphics is simple, typical side-scrolling shooting game. But there're some good points here,1. It's not that flashy and crowded (e.g. too much lighting, flashing bomb, etc.). I personally like this.2. I dont know about many other game like this nowadays, but in this game, when a ground unit shoot the missile,artillery, bomb, it actually getting bigger when it's closing in, not like some games who have ground+air units, yet the projectile still looks the same no matter they shoot from different angle/height/distance.Gameplay,1. Leveling system. Few games of this genre have this system, and with this, we can get the perks system and open some weapons slot2. The perks system (some call it mastery, passive, etc.) works well in this game.3. Customized arsenal (YES, I LIKE IT A LOT). Remember in some games like this, when you accidentally took 1 single weapon powerup, and your current maximum level weapon got replaced by lvl 1 new weapon? We dont have it in this game. We set the weapon right from the start at the armory. We can choose what we want in our plane, and we have 6 (AFAIK, could be more) weapon slots.Finally, the support from the developerTHEY ARE AMAZING!!!The response is quick,and the explanation is simple (the solution worked immediately).

												This is very interesting game which for some weird reason looks horrible on the store screenshots. Actually it has nice graphics with recognizable enemies and enviromental effects(like water ripples. It looks especially fun after nuclear strike. Yeah, this kind of game takes attention to detail) which makes experience organic and skill-based without some weird unexpectancies ruining the ride. Bosses are kinda fun: those are simple enough in terms of mechanic, but as I said - no unexpectancies: new enemies require adaptation, but learning ways to counter them is fun enough. Levels show interesting ways of indicating change of pace - zooming in or changing direction of flight. Leveling system is grindy sometimes but it provides good boost in case of hard level as loosing it makes XP accumulate regardless.It is also notable this game has enormous amount of additional gameplay capabilities: versus mode and stuff which should make it really good investment for prolonged amount of fun. Especially, considering current price.			",136,46,1,19,50,0,21

												It's 19 cents.It's an old school shooter with purchased upgrades. (in game purchases, not micro-transactions)It's fairly difficult, but not stupid hard.Nice graphics.I'd reccomend it, but I really wish someone could make a decent modern SHMUP that ""feels"" like the old school games as far as the intensity of action and level design.It's still a nice little shoot 'em up that will give you a little bit of Raiden or DonPachi style action.Edit: After spending more time with this game and beating the campaign, I can say it's a definite reccomend!There is a lot of extra stuff tossed in, like randomly generated skirmishes, a level up and perk system, and tons of weapons to try out and equip.

Revolution Ace is a really well done throwback to shoot-em-ups from the good old days of gaming, clearly inspired by games like the Raptor and 1940 series. It has everything that you could want in a modernized aircraft shooter, all of the aspects you know and love from back in the day with hints of more modern features such as customizable weapons, upgrades, a perks system and some cool multiplayer and challenger features brought to you by the ""Battle Chains"" mode. The lengthy singleplayer campaign is also a very welcome addition. Graphically, Revolution Ace isn't anything ground-breaking, but it's still pleasant to look at and is sufficient for the gameplay it re-introduces. The game is only really flawed by what feels like some overall polish and optimization issues here and there, FPS drops tend to happen somewhat often during later levels in the campaign, this can be helped by lowering the graphical options in the settings menu (though it shouldn't be necessary as my machine is capable of running games like Portal 2 with maxed out graphical settings). The user interface isn't fantastic either, it feels somewhat rushed and amateurish compared to the game itself, but the gameplay more or less makes up for some small graphical issues.Overall, this is a game I would happily recommend to anybody who enjoys some casual Shoot-Em-Up action. It's not a groundbreaking game, but it succeeds at what it sets out to do. Revolution Ace is worth it's price and is guaranteed to keep you entertained for hours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Disclaimer: I was given a Steam key for this game and did not pay for it.I don't really play bullet-hell or top-down shooters very often, but this one has been fun so far. The progression of upgrades and weapons is nicely paced, and there's enough variety to keep things interesting (new weapons/armor, perks, leveling up, etc). Boss battles are challenging but fair, even on easy difficulties. My only real complaint is that there's a very, very tiny delay (think mouse smoothing or something like that) between moving the mouse and the ship moving on screen. This looks to be a feature, but it took me some getting used to. Other than that, the controls are intuitive and responsive. Every time I died it was earned.The graphics are much nicer than the screenshots make them out to be. The music and sound effects fit in nicely with the action and don't become annoying at any point that I've reached yet. I haven't made it very far into the game, but I'm interested to see what else it has to offer. The price is right on point for something like this.If you like bullet-hell or top-down scrolly-shooters, then pick this one up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Cool take on a bullet hell shooter. But the lack of in game temporary picks ups makes the usually visceral experience provided by the genre absent.  Levelling up and being able to customise are good additions though. Having two seperate fire buttons for ground and sky enemies would have surely looked better on paper than it feels in game. Would prefer all guns blazing and coming into contact with the first enemy they hit vertically on the screen. As someone who accidentally flips through text based tutorials I did not figure out that there were ground and sky buttons until around the 3 or 4th game. Fire originating from ground enemies is hard to judge as it is in a 3d space when the view is 2.5d or potentially isometric.Well worth a look if you are into the genre but it is kind of a mixed bag.

												This is an inept Raptor: Call of the Shadows clone released 20 years after the fact. I could deal with the flash game graphics (static objects that pan and rotate whee) and Fischer Price: My First Soundtrack if the gameplay wasn't so hopeless. Popcorn enemies are bullet sponges, your weapons are varied but mostly feel impotent, and your gigantic hitbox extends generously past the visual border of your plane. Still, it's largely challengeless because the cheap hits are offset by a huge health bar and recharging shield. It's actually easier to beat many levels without shooting at all. Crazy.I only paid 25 cents or something, but it would have been better spent on a gumball. I'm mostly just irked that I wasted my time.			",306,76,8,29,26,3,41

												Revolution Ace is an Indie Shoot'em Up reminiscent of other, older, games like Tyrian or Raptor. The game is made in the Unreal Engine so it has some quite nice features, one of which would be actual game depth as opposed to a ""drawn"" background. Graphically speaking it isn't the top, but it isn't the worst. Some projectiles look nice, while then you have others which look like a brown Big Bullet Bills which could've and should've been handled differently. The music is mediocre, but it could get boring after playing it for a while. Some of the things that disturbed me the most was the lag/skipping of the music in the Main Menu, which didn't happen in-game but as well the fact it takes so long to unlock weapon slots and for some Achievements did not unlock. Some ground units seemingly just passed through impassable terrain making it a lot more confusing and for some reason some of the air units look like containers, furthermore confusing me about which projectiles to use because of the way they all look alike. Sometimes the combat feels clunky and slow, while the enemies just rush past you(most of the time you won't clear the waves, even when the enemies return). Shields will also regenerate only when you aren't shooting, but the whole point of the game is to shoot and destroy enemies, so that might need a rework. I also noticed the first two bosses were easier than normal enemies. Overall this game has high potential but it need some polishing, or so I believe. One of the most fun things is the upgrades the game offers for your Aircraft. I'd suggest buying it on sale, probably.>I'd give it a 4/10>Pros: High customization, destroyable terrain(buildings), nice depth perception, some parts of the graphics are nice, solid UI, multiplayer and several game modes, has cards and achievements(though the achievements didn't unlock for me)>Cons: Buggy, confusing enemy patterns, feels somewhat clunky and slow while enemies are too fast(most of the shots will miss because of that), first bosses weren't that challenging(I don't know about the rest)Copy supplied by developer.

-Quick Review-Revolution Ace is a throwback to old Arcade Bullet Hell game play that many experienced on the classic NES console. Revolution Ace lets you chose your own difficulty, and offers a great deal more entertaining game play; without the controller throwing and raging that I experienced with the classic Bullet Hell games.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: There isn't much to say about the story in this game... as you play through the game occasionally some text pops up speculating on why you're shooting down all these enemy planes.Game Play: You have two ""shooting"" buttons, one for flying vehicles and one for ground vehicles/buildings. The rest of the controls are simply movement controls, up, down, left, and right. As you progress through the game you get ""Scrap"" from your various missions that can be use to purchase upgrades for your aircraft in the Armory. There are plenty of upgrades to chose from; bullet weapons, laser weapons, rocket weapons, shields, and super weapons.Achievements: There are 19 achievements within the game, all of which are quite obtainable, the last 3 achievement do need a few tricks or repeatedly playing through certain levels to meet the required objectives.I earned close to 50% of the achievements on my first play through. It's also worth noting that all the achievements are able to be earned by yourself. So this is a nice easy ""100% Achievement"" game.Price Revolution Ace is priced at $4.99 that's a fair priced for how much time you can spend playing the game. I put in 7 hours before I had all the achievements (05/19/15), and if you really enjoy playing these types of games, it's definitely a good genre to add to your steam library.Conclusion: I can't remember the last time I played Bullet Hell game, but this one was definitely a winner, I recommend this game to anyone who misses playing old classic Bullet Hell games, however with less difficulty. Unless you like difficulty, in that case you can simply play Revolution Ace on a harder difficulty.			",141,13,3,13,8,0,23

												Take the standard top down shooter formula and add the ability to attack ground units ala xevious, an upgrade system of UN Squadron plus the unreal engine and you get an very enjoyable, simple yet satisfying sh'mup. I definitely recommend this game to anybody who enjoys the the genera or those feeling nostalgic yet still want the ability to increase difficulty. One criticism I have is the lack of a timer beyond determining your bonus at the end of the stage. In most Sh'mups its often  taken for granted how much it pushes you to improve, even in a campaign setting.			",111,14,0,14,10,0,5

												Revolution Ace is an astonishingly enjoyable arcade shoot-em-up.The graphics is at full HD 1920 x 1080p and there is eye candy in abundance with a huge array of effects and transitions.Playing with an X-box 360 controller is fully supported and the game play is fluid and accessible.  There are four difficulty settings to cater for players of varying skill levels.The menu system is well laid out and easy to use.The sound tracks are great metal riffs providing a good audio adrenaline pulse.  Game sounds are well sampled and well synchronized with what is observed on screen.Stages have beautifully textured terrain and plenty of variety.  There are a good assortment of units to destroy including air units, ground vehicles and turrets.  Buildings and terrain take damage too.  Floating collectible bonus spawns on destruction of certain units or buildings.This game is well polished and has a good replay value.Rating  9.5 / 10			",355,35,40,87,58,1,118

												This game,  is a pretty fun shooter, enemies attack from both the air and ground and the completing levels rewards you with experience points and shrapnel. Experience points are tallied up to increase the level of your jet, which leads to rewards such as more slots and new weapons and a perk of your choice. The perks range from better armor to faster bullets or strong laser. The shrapnel is your currency and is used to purchase the machine guns, missiles and beam cannons as well as shields and special attacks that make your craft so strong. There are more than 20 weapons to choose from and the placement on your jet matters which makes it fun. ",39,9,2,9,2,1,5

												When I was little, I used to play those aircraft shooter games at the arcade machines. Those can be fun, just moving the joystick, rapidly tapping on the 1, 2 or 3 buttons, destroying everything and picking up everything. Then when you die, you just insert more coins and continue the game. One simple playthrough. No headaches.Some may like it that way, but some might find it boring. How about this: an aircraft shooter game that you can play in the comfort of your home, with elements of customization; change weapons, upgrade armors. Gives you all the more reason to pick up drops than just aiming for the highest position on the highscore board.That is what Revolution Ace is. It is an arcade aircraft shooter. But it isn't just any aircraft shooter. It is 30% shoot anything that moves, 30% strategy and deciding what weapons to use for which mission, and 30% grinding for experience, levels, and the currency to upgrade stuff. The other 10%? Oh, that's reserved for the multiplayer capability.So if you like all the elements that make out the 100% of this game, get it, but only if you're a fan of aircraft shooters. It's not the top notch game in the market, but it's not all that bad either. I can definitely recommend this.Hikumi gives this game, a 5 out of 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game for almost 3 hours now and I think its time to write a review and move on. I think I payed 0.24 cents for this which is a steal. If you can find it for 0.50 it is still worth it. It is not a game which you play for hours in a row but it is something which you come back for to do a few missions. You can upgrade your plane with different weapons and you can unlock perks by leveling up. It's more then just flying around and shoot everything there is also a little bit of ""RPG"" things going on with the perks and weapon upgrades which you unlock by leveling up. I can say, I could play this game even more but hey, it was 0.24 cents and I have other games I could play. So time to move on, but not because the game has become boring. I could go in the game right now and be stuck for 30+45 minutes in it playing missions and unlocking things.Gameplay Video:

												Many dubious elements make this game to be far from correct:User interface is not very good: very little text font and not very well situated armor, shield and combo panels. Shop could have separate windows for air, ground, shield and superweapons, and show you precisely how the weapon works in another window. Instead of this, you have the not very handsome shopkeeper looking at you.Inicial firepower is ridiculous. Enemies gather on screen even on later stages.Has two separate buttons for air and ground shotting. This is the worst idea ever! At minimum firepower it becomes frustrating: you shoot at the ground, air enemies get you; you shot at the air, ground enemies overflow you with bullets. There are even some bosses which can only be hit by ground weapons, which have usually the less damage.Game probably expects you to grind money for weapons.Enemies and scenaries seem to repeat themselves instead of being separated by theme or appearance. The result is monotonous levels, all of them very alike.Bullet patterns from enemies and bosses do not seem to be very polished. There are moments where you will simply take damage whatever you do.Enemy waves do not seem to have a lot of thought behind them. They seem random and sometimes they stay on screen until they are destroyed, whith at early levels can create an extremely tough situation.Sometimes the game zooms in and you have less space to dodge bullets with no apparent reason. Also, when the screen turns ninety degrees it doesn't look very dinamic or game-like.Your ship is not very pretty.Story is just some scattered paragraphs.Yes, this game is cheap. But mainly it lacks some more mind work on its gameplay.			",340,121,9,34,30,7,31

												A very good classic shooter.  The graphics won't blow you away, and the sound is OK, not great, but all that doesn't matter when the gameplay shines.The mechanics are simple.  One fire button attacks air targets, the other attacks ground targets.  Don't fire to charge shields.  If you miss an enemy they will be back a second time with a yellow border.It is the combination of all of these factors in the escalating mission design that makes this a top shelf shooter.  Plus, you can send enemies at other people in multiplayer.8/10			",36,5,1,4,0,0,8

												I have been gaming, one way or another, for over 30 years. My favourite genre is twin stick shoot-em-up`s. Having watched some video of this game in action, I decided to take the plunge, was it worth it?My God, yes it was. This game contains everything I love about the genre. Masses of different enemies, many many weapons to unlock and equip, colurdul, detailed levels, and so much more.....  I think the Devs were trying to recreate the shooters from the old school, and they succeeded, and them some. The love and attention that has gone into this game shines through, and it makes playing the game even more pleasurable.One of the best features is the multi-player aspect, of sorts. If you get a good score on a level, you can decide to upload that level to the online leaderboards. It then becomes a challenge, and anyone who sees it, can have a go at beating your time/score. If they manage to do this, they can the re-upload the challenge, and send it back to you. I have been having a challenge with another guy for about 10 days now. It is so satisfying to beat their score, and send the challenge back to them.In closing, if you are in ANY WAY interested in this type of game, you really cannot go wrong. For the price, you are getting a game that is going to take you a fair while to actually complete, and then you have bonus levels, and the afore mentioned multi-player challenge system.I whole heartedly recommend this game.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Revolution Ace"" is a great indie shoot 'em up similar to the classic ""Raptor: Call of the Shadows"". You fit your ship with a number of weapons to battle hordes of air and ground targets. Collect scraps to upgrade your weapons and gain experience to level up and learn perks for additional bonuses.Its core gameplay is by no means unique, but ""Revolution Ace"" executes the concept well. The variety of weapons, specials and armor allow for different playstyles. The different game modes allow single player, two player co-op, versus and online battles. The difficulty can be adjusted to suit both hardcore gamers and newbies to the genre.The graphics are fairly good, with interesting explosion and water effects. The music generally suits the mood. Not much in terms of story, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing for a shoot 'em up.Overall, I would recommend it to any player looking for a well made shoot 'em up game.			",45,14,0,9,3,0,3

												Revolution Ace is an Old School bullet hell inspired game, but with a couple modern twists.The core gameplay itself is basically the same, lots of enemies and lots of bullets, and you gotta shoot them all down.And at the end of the level there is a lovely boss battle awaiting your arrival.If you are a fan of bullet hell shooters, this is a sure go for you.Especially since this game possesses a few extra things to it.Like ground targets, a level up system, bizarre water physics, a nice co-op mode, a versus mode, an ""offline"" versus mode(basically like a highscore system, where you challenge your friends to beat it) and Hank your trusty engineer.If your not a fan and got some spare cash, you might just give it a try, it is a nice and fun time killer.But the main campaign does drag itself a bit, possibly due to the leveling mechanic.The game can also double as a nice bonding experience with a brother of friend due to some stages an insane mode being quite challenging, thus possibly requiring the aid of a partner to best them.All in all it's a solid game, but it haves some issues, but it stays true to the genre besides it's added components.I'd recommend it, but don't expect a masterpiece.

												A lot of fun, if you're playing by yourself or with friends.  For the price, you're getting a good game.  However, as expected, for the price, you're getting a lot of issues as well.  The online functions of the game need a lot of work as the connection issues it has can kick you out mid game, kick you from the party after the mission, or make simply joining the party a living hell.  The game also crashes rather unexpectedly for no apparant reason.  During certain missions, if you're not host, enemies may be entirely invisible.  Also as you hit higher levels it becomes a grind fest to get the scrap and experience to keep steadily progressing.  Nor do you get a reward for every level up which is a relatively minor complaint.  The most glaring problems are the multiplayer and I think with work it will be great.  If you get this game, don't expect to be playing it with friends.  It is a great time waster to play by yourself however.  The weapons don't feel imbalanced and the enemies don't really feel cheap or overpowered.			",117,12,0,23,7,0,17

												I just played another shoot-em-up right before this and what a difference the two games have. I honestly base shoot-em-up games mainly on the in game graphics.The gameplay's graphics were designed to be somewhat realistic, but the game suffers from this imo. It's not the good-looking kind of realistic, which annoyed me when I played the game since I couldn't clearly see the enemy's projectiles. In a game where I am supposed to dodge and shoot everyone up, not being able to clearly see (so you can dodge the projectile) defeats the purpose of the game. I ended up not giving the game much of a chance after the first few minutes of gameplay since I kept getting frustrated with the graphics. I did not want to attempt even harder levels where there are more enemies than the first level with these graphics. Overall, the game might have potential to be played. However, I couldn't bear with the graphics to keep trying. I suggest this for players that don't mind the graphics and just enjoy shoot-em-up in general. 5/10.			",52,13,0,4,0,0,1

												When you have a game priced around a dollar or two make no mistake that it would be a budget title, but just because it wasn’t charging you an arm or a leg it doesn’t mean it had to be bad. What we have here is quite the contrary indeed.While the use of Unreal engine on a shoot them up might have been a weird choice, the action in itself is slick and fanciful, there wasn’t a moment where I felt put off by the graphics. The implementation of a physics system meant you can see you enemies explode in a multitude of ways as well, with debris causing ripples across the sea or scraps rolling down the hill.That said, the game did suffer from some pacing problems with awkward windows where nothing spawned screen for ages, ruining your combo. The boss designs also suffered from a lack of creativity too, with a few so mundane that made the battle felt underwhelming.The most noteworthy feature is the lengthy campaign, which has 18 stages in total spanning 4 to 8 minutes each. If that wasn’t enough to justify purchase, there are also procedurally generated challenges made with seeds, along with two multi-player modes. So if you aren’t completely sold upon first glance, you can always count on replay value instead.All that aside, you can definitely do a lot worse with 2 bucks on Steam, so there’s no reason not to give this title a try.

												I enjoy this game, I've always been a fan of shooter games like this. I started out on easy, it felt like a medium difficulty. By the Canyon Complex stage it felt more like hard/advanced. I agree with a reviewer who mentioned the weapons seem under powered, it really shouldn't take that long to shoot a tiny rocket out of the sky. Overall I enjoy the game, it would probably be a lot more fun with a friend by my side, lighting up the sky.Edit: While its on sale, I suggest buying a few copies to give to your friends so you can play co-op because there doesn't seem to be anyone playing. It's worth the 19 cents, I bought a few copies.			",258,65,4,11,40,2,19

												In this 2D shooter, you're tasked with saving the-- ah screw it. There is a storyline but I don't care about it and neither should you. Basically you're destroying enemies, collecting cash, upgrading your arsenal, and repeating until boredom sets in. One of the other reviews on this page compares it to Tyrian...or was it Tyrian 2000? It might have been Raptor: Call of Shadows for all I can remember. Anyway, this isn't a difficult game to process. The challenge is in finding the weapons that suit your style of play. Everything else is fundamentals (dodge bullets). There are a large number of stages, but most of them play out the same way. There are numerous enemies, each with their own pattern and method of attack. Through any number of combinations, their aim is to destroy you. While campaign levels are structured in a manner similar to classic overhead shooters of the 80s, there are an assortment of random levels where anything can happen. All in all, this shooter doesn't give off a hand-crafted and thoroughly polished vibe. It's not like the average game by Cave* which has 5 stages that are  meticulous in their design and execution. This game has a lot of stages, and the common theme is ""We have tanks, ships, and turrets, let's cram them wherever.""Couple this lazy level-design with poor mechanics (the hit-box is too big), bullets that can blend in with the scenery, and the result is something that I should hate.But I dont.What? Yeah I know, I'm a guy with a Cave avatar, I should be a bit more particular about the shmups that I enjoy. But I have to admit that I like this game.To me at least, the most compelling aspect for some games is experimentation. One of my favorite games of all time is Guardian Heroes, and most of the time I just play Versus mode. GH is a fighter/beatemup with a hugely unbalanced cast of characters. When I throw them all into the arena, the results can be interesting. Additional variables such as the experience level (which affects stats) further change how things play out. A lot of that game is spent just playing with ideas. It's a fun game on its own, but the creative aspects give it a lot of dimension.Revolution Ace has this same characteristic in not just its weapon system, but also in the random stages. Numerous enemies and boss combinations can appear, which can result in a number of unique situations. Furthermore, by progressing through the campaign, the difficulty can be increased (through a +1, +2, etc system). Sometimes the results are really unfortunate. I recall one level where the boss appeared, but then the field did a 90 degree turn. So instead of the boss being in front of me, he was to the side, and I didn't really have the weapons to reach him at that angle. The Battle Chain mode is interesting. This is an indirect-competitive mode. What you do is play through a stage, upload your score, and then another player can opt to challenge that score. Now what makes this mode interesting is that all of the combos and power-ups you grab, can have an affect on the opposition. Larger combos can spawn more enemies, power-ups can add more dangers, etc. If the opposing player succeeds in beating your score, then you can challenge the new hi-score, and so on, and so on. You can even save your replays locally, and play against yourself. It's a really neat idea, but to get the most out of it requires strong weapons**. Getting strong weapons requires some grinding.The grinding aspect is most likely going to turn away some players. There are some compelling aspects to Revolution Ace, but they require an investment of time. Usually with 2D shooters we're given a game that takes 30 minutes to ""complete"" but a great many hours to beat without continuing, dying, and/or getting the highest possible score. With this game however, the campaign is much longer, there are numerous optional stages, and most of the hours are spent leveling up and affording the best gear. For some gamers the grind is compelling in itself, but for others, they'll want to get the kind of experience that can't be measured in raw numbers. That's not to mention that on its own, Revolution Ace is a poor 2D shooter. It has a lot of flaws that would sink other games, and yet I think it's fascinating. But that's just me.*I hope I don't get tired of mentioning Cave by the time Mushihime-sama comes out.**And players too, can't forget them.			",914,265,35,107,34,4,37

												Ill keep this one shortThis is a nice game resembling a lot of the aspects of a very old (and quite awesome) game like Raptor.The online features give it some replayability and overall you can have some decent fun playing the campaign or modes in between games, also very reasonable price.While overall the game concept is ok and one can have fun with the game, i cannot completely recommend it due to some of the performance holes this game has. Particularly with co op or any splitscreen mode, the game fails to render properly and completely breaks the fps on high end machines. Also it can get jammed or it can freeze upon exit. Those issues should be addressed to be able to recomend this			",104,9,0,5,0,0,0

												Grinding in a Shoot-em-up? Yep, and not the fun kind either.For starters Revolution Ace is very unfriendly to new players. I've played for 2 hours and my weapons were just as useless as when i started despite numerous ""upgrades"".Also if you like playing this kind of game with a mouse, forget it; the sensitivity is way too low even on its maximum setting. There are a lot of dopey design decisions, chiefly:Power-up's having a delay between their appearance and their availability.Enemy ship types which are impossible to destroy on their first pass without you taking more damage than them.In-game power-up's which don't last long enough to be of any use.Super-weapons which are either ineffective or take so long to recharge that you only get to use them once per level. Ship and weapon upgrades that don't appear to make your foes any easier to kill or your ship any harder to damage.Level-up 'perks' which are so ineffective that one questions their inclusion in the game. There is an auto shield-recharge but by the time the game has realised that you're not shooting anymore, the screen has filled up again.And occasionally the game crashes on exit and prevents you returning to desktop. What's good about it? Some of the music is cool and I like the 3-dimensional landscape. Overall Revolution Ace is more frustrating than is really necessary. With so many excellent shooters available, there really is no room for this title; at least not for money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay wow this is an unexpectedly good game. Bought it randomly for $0.25 (ironically like inserting a single quarter into an old timey arcade machine).First of all my background: I played ~300 hours of Raptor Call of the Shadows when I was growing up (shareware version from a magazine, then I bought the full version that Apogee mailed to me on floppies).If you loved Raptor you'll love this.If you saw screenshots of Raptor without understanding it, or prefer Japanese-style bullet hell shooters, or side scrollers, you might not like this.The tactical combat is almost exactly like Raptor, right down to most enemies shooting yellow orbs at you (and the ""wave"" gun and auto-targetting laser). You will take damage, that's unavoidable, so shield/armor management is an important part of each level (just like Raptor). You can equip multiple weapons with vastly different weapon patterns. Target priority and order is very important, as is deciding between air and ground. Lots of neat enemies and some fun levels with your plane flying higher/lower or the view rotating.First some complaints I read, but didn't experience. Not sure if the dev just fixed them over time or if the original issue was wrong. Either way:- Grinding - There was grinding in Raptor. If you don't think so you didn't play Elite difficulty, where you had to farm the lower difficulties for money and upgrades. Even before the final Outer Regions waves you'd farm the earlier levels that dropped shields to have more than the max. So redoing some missions or a bit of skirmish here shouldn't be unfamiliar or unfun.- Performance - Ran fine for me. I didn't have an fps counter on, so maybe the framerate dropped, but projectiles were still dodge-able and there was no visible stutter. When playing the graphics actually look better than the screenshots.- Slowness - For the screen/view size the plane is almost exactly as fast as Raptor. Again, expectations.- Anemic Weapons - Depending on your loadout you might have to stay on a target for a bit. There are few one shots here. No surprises considering how long even late-game Raptor took to kill some enemies. This means you need to get used to how many shots it takes to kill an enemy, and not waste more than that.- Hitboxes - Your plane/ship seems accurately represented, and I've dodged shots by what felt like pixels. Sometimes enemies have deceiving hitboxes in regards to their shape, but that's pretty rare.- PhysX - Someone mentioned needing older Nvidia drivers for this game. I ran it fine with the latest drivers at the time.So basically a lot of the complaints can be explained as: that's how Raptor did it.If I DID have a complaint with the game it's that incoming enemies don't have shadows, which makes it a bit hard to be pre-firing at the right area. The backgrounds can similarly be a bit distracting/overwhelming at times. And the weapon and equipment could use better ordering or sorting in the shop. Not anything game breaking though.But that is balanced but a dozen pros, a few of which I'll list here:- Random Levels - I would have killed for this feature as a kid. You can choose a seed and get a random level complete with a boss. So fun and so replayable, and really adds enjoyment to any ""grinding"" aspect. In addition the campaign is 20 levels, plus another 4 unique plus 8 types of random for skirmish.- Shield Recharge - Shields have a recharge delay and rate which kicks in once you start shooting. Managing this is a lot of fun and adds a new dynamic.- Enemies Return - If you don't kill an enemy they come back later (and reward less scrap on death). So levels quickly spiral if you miss kills.- Ground and Air - Very fun switching between the two, and it's a bit more seamless than Raptor where you'd have to swap active weapons. Here you just hold ""Shift"" to fire any available ground weapons.- Builds - With perks and such varied weapons you get a lot of choice to each playthrough. You could focus on Plasma, or maybe go for rebounding missiles, or rapid firing machine guns.- Modes - Some really unique and imaginative modes outside the main campaign, such as competitive ""Battle Chains"". Great amount of content for such an inexpensive game.In summary the best way to describe this game is an underrated gem and spiritual successor to Raptor. I'm sad for the dev that it didn't get more initial praise and seems to be misunderstood by the majority of the community.Well I'm happy to say as a hardcore Raptor player this hits the EXACT right spot.(And if your time is worth anything at all, in the time you read this review you earned well over the price of the game			",192,29,5,24,16,3,31

												Fun Arcade Style scrolling Fighter Plane Game. Best Played with a Friend. You can customize your fighter between levels with the points you earn. You also unlock weapon slots as you level up. Played with a friend pretty much 3 hours straight the first night and nearly unlocked all of the weapon slots. That really opens you up to tweaking your build to what works for you. The way it was designed you just about have to switch to some skirmish games between some of the campaign levels. You will find you just need a bit more points to unlock some things, so you can make it through the next campaign level. You have to complete a level to actually earn points to buy things, but you get to keep your experience. The game play is fairly fast paced compared to a classic like 1942.			",155,12,0,14,6,0,35

												It has a really slow and grindy start, at least it feels like a grind because you only start with machine guns and missiles. Missiles have the lowest DPS and are the worst possible choice, imo. However, the real fun starts once you level up and unlock weapon slots and get more scrap (currency for weapons and subsystems). The game really shines at this point and the pace quickens. Placing weapons on my fighter was also fun, there's a certain level of planning to it. Depending on which slot you place a weapon, it will fire from that slot location.I was kindly decieved by my quick glances at the screenshots. I thought this was a 2D game but, in-fact, it's completely in 3D. Even the background is 3D! There's also a physics engine so pieces of buildings and enemy aircraft litter the ground. The water also reacts to your weapons which can be a distraction at first but you learn to ignore it.Bosses are fun but sometimes too easy if you have strong anti-air capability. Ground bosses are more dangerous. Some bosses spawn units and there doesn't appear to be any limit to them. This can lead to unit spam and missile spam which will almost always certainly kill you.Pros: Upgrade & Perk System allows for customization. Beautiful artwork. Nice sound effects. Easy to die, makes dodging actually worth it. Gamepad support.Cons: Early game is a crawl. No apparent limit to boss minions. Some ground enemies take too long to destroy. Shield siphon regens 50% of shield every 60 seconds. (This makes Burly Shields overpowered and Speedy Shields useless!)Neutral: The mechanic needs a shower.Overall, I had great fun with this game. You get what you pay for and I recommend it. 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I tried to give this game a good rating, but instead, I found frustration.I'll be honest, the game pwned me within the first levels till I worked my way out of those weapons and made the perfect combo for my style, however, something that is unforgivable in this case, is low framerates on a bullet hell game. Hell, I loved the water physics that was promised, but at the first level you play at night, from the middle of the map and onward, the frames drop real low at a point I no longer have control of my ship nor can predict the projectile paths like I did in every previous levels, so yeah, the game disappoints me, it has potential but maybe it should focus on performance a bit more, in order to give the players a smooth gameplay.

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Spaceship bullethell game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere are many resolution sizes.You can play on fullscreen or windowed mode.You are able to change the Music Volume with a slidebar.You are able to change the Sound Volume with a Slidebar.You are able to change the mouse sensitivty.You are able to change your controls and xbox controller Controlls.You can play this online Co-op or Versus mode. (game is dead however)You are able to play Local Co-op.You are able to play Local Versus mode.No Tutorial.There is a difficulty settings.You are able to play on a xbox controller.About the game.You are a spaceship destroying other enemies in your sight and reach the end of the level. You have to avoid enemy bullets and ships and get scrap by killing enemy units. You can use these scrap to buy new items in the armory. Whenever you are not shooting, your shields will regenerate back. You are able to kill enemies on the land and in the sky. If you have missed an enemy, then there is a chance that it will return with a yellow highlight but in the results of less money.  If you are levelling up and you are high enough, then you will unlock a perk at your choice.Music is okay.Game could be repetitive.Graphics is okay.You are able to level up.No Tutorial.Other things.Some of the bullets could be hard to see becaues of the background scenery.Grindy-------------------I Give this game a 6/10 ",462,169,6,45,48,1,62

												So many great ideas here completely undermined by awful art design. Your shots feel powerless and disappear into the background, it's hard to tell when you're actually causing damage to the enemies, and even harder to tell when enemies are considered ""on the ground"" (requiring a different shot) or not.If this game was re-released with a few competent art people doing a graphics overhaul, it might be one of the greatest shmups of the decade, but as it currently is, it's all potential with very little delivery, no matter how hard one tries to like it for the innovations it brings to the table.

Yes, I'm Looking For Some Computer Games? Something Like Solitaire? Maybe Pong? Do You Have Pong? - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]Steam is home to an abundance of all sorts of games. Almost everything conceivable can be found there, from the latest big budget title to the most niche girls with cat ears hentai clicker game.While some titles can slip through the cracks, Steam's major sales can always bring some interesting things to the surface for pretty cheap. The Steam bargain bin is kinda like a box of chocolates though. There's good, there's bad, and the doctors say if I have any more they'll take my foot. And sometimes, there's stuff like Revolution Ace.Does your dad like to play the computey games? Maybe your grandpa? Do they talk about all the Japs they killed in The War? Are modern games too hard for them? Have them play this. They'll love it.Revolution Ace is an old-school shoot-em-up, in the same vein as classics like Raptor or Tyrian. Or like Xevious, you probably know what Xevious is. Space Invaders. Pew-pew? The games they used to play on big ♥♥♥♥ing stove-♥♥♥ things. Not a hard concept to visualize.You steer a ship around an auto-scrolling level and shoot incoming enemies. Sometimes you get power-ups, sometimes you don't. The communists would love to promise you power-ups guaranteed for everyone, but they're full of ♥♥♥♥. Commie ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Revolution Ace is a decent shoot-em-up for a semi-modern take on MS-DOS classics, though somewhat slower paced than most.Not particularly original, as most of it is a revisiting of elements from older classic shooters, shooters that are freeware you can literally just download for free somewhere. But people love retro, that's totally cool. Most indie games are just rehashed retro games anyway, right? They got the jumping, the shooting, and all the stuff you used to play on your old Nintendo computer game system. Same thing, right? Just like grandpa used to play. Only he played in real life, and killed real people. Ha ha, good old gramps.Touting full 3D environments and all the marvels of modern graphics, complete with Unreal Engine power and real water physics simulation, Revolution Ace looks great. They put all those fancy words in the game description, just like a real AAA game. It definitely looks more modern and recent than any older shooter, which is really just common sense. It's not playing on a ♥♥♥♥ing calculator display. Of course it's going to look better. But there in comes the biggest gripe I had with the game.None of it is necessary, none of it improves the core gameplay, and at times it actually detracts from the experience. You don't need to put a pound of sprinkles on a cracker with some whipped cream on it. They won't all fit, and you won't even be able to see the cracker. And who the ♥♥♥♥ would put whipped cream on a cracker in the first place? There's no reason for that. There's no excuse. It really feels like their priorities were a little backwards.Bullets are near indistinguishable from the background on certain maps, the Call of Duty color palette melding together into a mess of movement that's almost dizzying at times. Sometimes entire enemies, or your own ship even, will get lost amid all the action on screen. There's just too much going on, everywhere, all the time. I don't mind the fancy backgrounds, but something to make the things you should actually be keeping your eye on more pronounced from the environment would've been really helpful. A more stylized approach probably would've went over a lot better.Revolution Ace's odd graphical quirks don't stop at its overly obnoxious backgrounds though. There's multilevel enemy placement, with certain enemies in the air, and certain ones on the ground. Different buttons will be your ground attack and air attack, so you need to make sure you know what you're aiming at. Which is kind of a ♥♥♥♥♥ when you can't differentiate what is what.Do you know the difference between a boat and a ship? Now imagine that same boat and ship, the exact same size, with almost no way to differentiate 3D space. That way, if you're fighting over a very plain ocean backdrop, they can still confuse you. Gotta make sure you're frustrated somehow. It's something you get used to, but a graphical oversight nonetheless.The game's graphical issues reach their height of absolute exasperation in the multiplayer modes, which shrinks everything down for split-screen action. There's just too much happening on screen and not enough room to display it all, especially when the backgrounds make seeing interactable objects as hard as it already does.I was able to work past the odd graphical design choices, but even then it's not a particularly great shoot-em-up. The slower pace is alright at first, but levels become a complete slog as you progress. The bizarre RPG elements don't quite fit. Upgrading and customizing your ship, I'm down with. Raptor had that, Tyrian had that. But the sluggish leveling and upgrading system in Revolution Ace almost requires you to go back and play older levels purely to grind for experience to unlock more weapon slots.Enemies can take a surprising amount of bullets for a shoot-em-up, so you're gonna be stuck letting waves of enemies fly right past you because it's impossible to take them down without sitting directly in their line of fire for a few precious seconds. After the early levels, the enjoyment factor drops significantly. There's a substantial hurdle before the game becomes enjoyable again, and even then it requires a ton of grinding in a game that really didn't need this kind of system in the first place.It's really not a bad game, just a significantly flawed game. It definitely tries its best, but ultimately falls flat and generally feels a little uninspired and dull. The multiplayer mode is a fun little twist, but suffers from the rest of the game's faults and can't really pull the rest of the experience up. Plus it's a game I bought for a nickel on Steam, the servers aren't exactly lit.I can't help but feel like they really just screwed themselves over with the biggest market that would actually pay for that game, and that's old people. There's too many bright colors and that hurts their eyes, they can't play this. They're gonna drop this faster than folks drop at the retirement center. They're gonna go back to playing cards and staring wistfully out windows at autumn trees shedding their leaves, taking in the subtle symbolic nature of death and renewal. And how much they hate the kids these days.Our view will pan to the lone leaf fluttering in the breeze, shaking loose and blowing away while they blissfully slip into a sleep they'll never wake from. They're dead. The caretaker will discover them in the morning when they go to sweep the dust off of them, and they will say ""Oh well"".That's how I feel about this game. Oh well.Oh well.

Trading cards you get from this game actually cost more than the game itself, so when you sell it on the market, the game earns you money instead.As a side note, those friends who own this game are usually cheapskate profit masters like myself.Pros:>Gives you three trading cards ($0.36 in my currency)>Very cheap ($0.20 in my currency)>profitable ($0.07 after taxes)>cards can be easily obtained by IdleMaster (don't worry, you will not get banned)>makes you look like a hardcore game collector so you get nice badges and look cool.Cons:I actually don't know, never played the game.

												It has an interesting premise, but the game ends up feeling either unfair or slow. The enemy design is extremly generic, and most of the upgrades make little to no difference in the game : a shoot'em up should already provide you with enough upgrades to go on in a single stage, not obbly you to loot for them in other levels. Anyways, games like Steredeen reproduce this concept way better than this one.			",94,43,2,1,1,0,0

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			",539,108,26,84,46,10,56

												TL:DR - This game is a horrible, horrible shooter.Enemies are bland and forgettable, do far too little damage, and take far too much damage to be killed to keep gameplay streamlined. Enemies that go off-screen coming back is a neat feature, but it's not implemented very well.Speaking of streamlining, the game interrepts the action to give you tutorial pop-ups during the gameplay. In a shooter, this is a sin.The music is bland, generic and does not fit the tempo of the action. There is no feeling that you're actually fighting a boss when you come to one.Bosses are laughable by the way.This game is bad.			",398,106,7,71,38,3,70

												I think this game would've been great if some of it's flaws were addressed.Enemy bullets are sometimes difficult to see, let alone hard to dodge when the game is spaming enemies, and you having a somewhat big hitbox. Recharging your shields can also be a pain since in order to recharge it, you must not fire your weapons while avoiding enemy fire, or you can do what I do: use the shield recharge super weapon.Some of the level ups are disappointing, once you fill out the experience bar at the end of a stage, you may gain a new weapon slot, more items at the shop, a new perk, or worst... NOTHING AT ALL! Which makes you think, ""What's the point of that level up?""Maybe this game is worth playing with a friend, but it's trial and error, and feels like a grind if you're playing alone.

												For the entire review, head to https://bryanrumsey.wordpress.com/2015/07/01/review-revolution-ace/""Revolution Ace attempts to breathe life into a stagnant genre and, for the most part, it does. A quick check on its Steam page shows almost 400 reviews with a “Mostly Positive” rating. However, this genre resurrection is paid at a high price as most of the systems that made the genre popular in the first place have been sacrificed in favor of grinding and a generic power fantasy mechanic. There is obviously a market for this type of gameplay but I don’t see much intersection with the fanbase of the older style of sidescrolling shooters.""			",598,118,13,70,19,3,71

												It's an ""Okay"" game. If you're a fan of bullet hell games this one is worth checking out. It also *CURRENTLY* comes with a free copy of LGG's new game, Polarity. (enter email in launcher)You can tell after playing it for about 0.5 seconds that this is heavily inspired by Raptor: Call of the Shadows, and it tries to be a more modern reimagining of that classic (and still amazing) game. However, there were a number of things about it I didn't like, like the grind-festy nature of the game: where in Raptor you could only buy equipment between missions that would only last to the end of your current run, in Revolution Ace you gain levels and unlock perks and new equipment which can then be 'bought'.What this turns the game into though is a boring slog of levels that are entirely too easy for my ship, and levels that I can't beat until I farm more levels and get ever better equipment for my ship.Also, the physics/terrain was a cool idea, but I find it behaves strange in some situations.... for example detonating a megabomb over water often causes jello-like splashing effects that persist unrealistically until the screen scrolls past it. I've also noticed some huge FPS drops in a game which should be relatively light to run, in areas where really not much is going on (poorly optimized?). Random 10FPS stutters that don't visibly seem to be connected to any happenings on the screen can make it a rather troublesome bullet hell game.Still, if you're a fan of the genre you will probably get some enjoyment			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Come take a trip back in time where the top down shooter was king, and jumping the pilot seat to take on waves upon waves of enemies as you try to fly your way through the campaign. Revolution Ace, by Laser Guided Games, takes you exactly there.Graphically this game looks crisp but also feels like a lot of free assets went into the game, I might be totally wrong but some of what I found in the game looked very generic. Speaking of generic, the actual plane that you'll be flying is actually probably one of the weakest assets in the game.I love the background music, it definitely fits in with the arcade theme feel that this game is going for. I do really wish that there was a little bit more sound outside of the background music, this actually makes the game feel a bit weird.My biggest issue with the game has to be the random crashes. I'm not sure what causes this to happen but there's definitely something odd going on when you're in the middle of the level and the whole game shuts down.Another issue that I see with this game is the armory/money system. I'm not a fan of the pricing in the game, and the whole store just doesn't feel all that right. Now that being said I was using a gamepad, as this is the type of game that I feel SCREAMS gamepad, but perhaps I might be wrong.This is a valiant attempt at making a top down shooter that has challenging gameplay, interesting levels, and some cool power-ups, but there's just something missing from this game that makes me want to keep coming back. I just think that this game has this unfinished feel to it, and maybe there's a lot yet to come, but as of right now this is a game that unless you are a DIE-HARD top down shooter, have to have every top down shooter known to man, type of person, this is a game better off left alone. This game gets a 5.6 out of 10.			",137,98,1,33,5,2,28

												If you like run-of-the-mill top-down shooters, this is your game. It's infused with this annoying NOISY MACHO EDGE and it's really not very fun. The graphics are nice, though. The active gameplay screen feels a little off, on the other hand -- something like too much mobility or something, I can't put my finger on it. but again, the actual graphics are nice.The upgrade/progression elements are very slapdash, poorly explained and poorly executed. It seems like they were just thrown on top of a Raptor clone.			",313,100,8,49,27,1,43

												First I idled for cards for 6,3 hours so my actual playtime is 11-ish hours. Got it incredibly cheap. Actually the four pack was on sale so I gifted two copies of the game to friends, got one for myself and one spare. So, this is a shoot'em up game, obviously, but it's the first one where I had to shoot both air and ground enemies. Really addictive. You earn cash and xp, unlock new weapons, can play local co-op, online or a campaign. When you beat the latter you unlock a +1 difficulty which has more enemies and they are also shoot more bullets than normal ones. If you are good enough to beat +1 you unlock +2 difficulty which is the max? Online mode is interesting. When you make a 5x, 10x, 15x, etc. combo some enemies spawn to your opponent's side. Some of the achievements are hard but somehow I got them all. The music is not irritating nor distracting so for me it was ok-ish. Has trading cards as well if you care about them. Cheap game with good quality. Even paying full price is worth it. I am glad I bought it and highly recommend it if you're into shoot'em up games.			",651,285,14,45,69,10,88

												A pretty cool game. Simple, fun, easy to pick up. Similar to Raptor from the 1990s. You certainly get your money's worth. Hell, Raptor costed more back in the day.Controls are good. Sound FX is great. Gameplay can be seen below:

												For its price is a good game...but it needed just a little bit more work and the game would be perfect.I like the idea of upgrades and leveling, music is great, but.....visuals are so-so, but.....gameplay is not fluid for this kind of game. It feels, somehow, unnatural for this type of game.Idea is great, but realization....not quite.			",633,181,20,104,58,6,120

												I tried to write a review of this game where I typed in all the flaws the game has. Maybe it was too long or something but steam didn't accept the review. The game is like Raptor Call of the Shadows, except that it so much worse... somehow it's still entertaining, I guess it's because of lack of games like this. I still have to recommended it. If you havent played Raptor or Tyrian, get them instead.			",115,24,1,23,16,0,30

												Interesting game! The game is very nice, but the game does not recognise my mouse when I am in the menu, but I can use keyboard cotrols, so that is cool. The game does work with my mouse when I am in the game, so that is nice as well. The game originally put the resultion too high, so the game did not want to start, and if you are having the same problem, then just press the ""F11"" button on your keyboard, and the game will work in window mode, then you can set your resultion in the game options, then you can also play in full screen. Though there are some errors, what I mentioned above, the gameplay is actually very nice, so I recommend! Cool Game!			",109,22,17,5,21,4,9

												Well, it was nice for a few rounds, but became very frustrating. It all depends on your weapon of choice: if you take 2 quad homing missiles and for the rest twin machine guns, you'll tear through the enemies without caring too much about getting hit. This playstyle is too easy, so no fun. On the other hand, if you pick beam weapons, you'll be ♥♥♥♥ed. The ones with the strong beams which can aim at air and ground are strong, but bugged. They are likely to shoot at air though you are constantly holding down the ground attack botton.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Why do I dislike an Unreal-Engine-crafted game I bought for 11ct as a product out of the ""Hyperspace pack""? Simply because ""Revolution Ace"" doesn't feel like being worth that little sum. I know it's unfair, but there are some other titles from the genre I have enjoyed more. If I made a list here, there would be more positive aspects than negatives, but two of them overweight. I don't really enjoy to dislike such a game, as I have been looking for good bullet-hell-shooters for a long time, so I will point out the things I like at first. There's the soundtrack, which is surprisingly epic. Orchestral synthesizer, combined with catchy melodies match perfectly the game's atmosphere. As music is an important element of the game, Laser guided games deserve my thumb up for their OST. The gameplay is pretty standart for such a game, but as advertised, the upgrade system is pretty attractive. Thumb up for that! Phantastic working physics, destructible buildings, there you go!Local two player... I guess there's no need to explain any further, thumbs up to you!A few things I neither like nor dislike would be...The story. Sure, it's good they made one but it's nothing special, pretty average to be honest.The gameplay, as said before, Revolution Ace has neither innovative nor complex abilities, there's HUD, two primary and a secondary weapon(s), one special ability, shields, powerups and stuff. I have seen all of that once or twice before but without those this wouldn't be a game. And now for the part which is important for my review: The things I dislike. There are three, two of which are directly related to each other. I will start right with the other one.Ground troopers. (...) Oh seriously, they are SO DAMN ANNOYING! The aiming is absolute garbage, ground unites are close to impossible to be hit. Maybe it's my fault, but because of the decrease of gaming experience I want you to take that thumb down, right between your eyes.So now you will finally be able to read the reason for my dislike:

For usage of Unreal technology the graphics are a shame. They prove us that they used Unreal Engine to power the animations but the result is ugly as hell. I am especially disappointed of the effects. Even on high graphics, the quality is pitiable. Two thumbs down for that, there's no way I could do else.

Directly belonging to this: Lags. Seems untrustworthy, I know, but I do really think that a GTX630 (M) should be able to take over this. It couldn't. While I had around 20 FPS on high quality, on low resolution settings this often framedropped horribly. Not a desirable condition at all, but in a game that requires close reaction, that is even worse. I can't explain why exactly that always happens, but until it's not fixed, this is absolutely horrible to play. I also give you two thumbs down for that, sorry, it has to be.
Developers: I don't want to blame you. Wait, in fact, I do indeed. The thing is that not the bad graphics make this game bad, but it's your advertising. If you hadn't highly praised your engine, I maybe wouldn't complain. I wouldn't even consider the graphics being bad, as this isn't even necessary for a game to be good. But for unreal standarts what you did is unacceptable. And the performance issues mess with the fun the players should develop even more. If I am a single case, I am sorry, but this is still my opinion.			",66,20,1,1,5,0,6

												Played as much as I could before getting disoriented as I'm not used to play these types of games, only when I was a kid, but there was less dynamic and more static movement.Played this game with mouse only, and in my opinion it had the feeling of being a bit stiff, tried to turn up and down on my dpi but alas, didn't change the stiffness.As stated earlier I played these sort of games when I was a kid, and I ate it raw, it's nice to see someone pick it up and mix it up with a little shop and dynamics, such as using your super-weapon bomb on a water level makes the waters turn insane :)The shop is quite limited and the developers made a minor flaw in it, you can sell your stock weapons.... You can be left with nothing, which isn't a good sign for areal combat :)Overall this game was enjoyable until they introduced an aerial type that shot zigzag, I had no clue on how to get onto them :I And in the end my eyes hurt from playing this...But I believe that someone out there will see this game as his favorite, also a shout-out to the developer for giving me the heads up on this game~7/10 Don't think I will return, but I think this game has potential to become something bigger than it is :)			",730,217,26,101,67,10,102

Misses the MarkThis game, as if you couldn't tell, tries to follow in the footsteps of such bullet hell shooters as  Raptor and Tyrian. It fails.Now while the game does try earnestly there are just some decisions that seem to have doomed the game to banality. As with Tyrian and Raptor, you can earn money to buy upgrades and weaponry; unlike Tyrian and Raptor, the addition of a leveling system pretty much means it becomes more about grinding than it does skill.Then there are the graphics: in games such as this it is extremely important for the player to be able to see what they are shooting, what they are hitting and what is shooting at them. This game kinda falls flat in that department. A more vibrant palette would have done this game a world of good.All in all , this game might have been better if it had just been polished a little more. As it is, I cannot recommend it. Better you play one of the better games it is trying to imitate.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Does something strange to keyboard. I tested this before having to write this review, so it is something that should be looked into. Hopefully just a bug and not something malicious. After having it open for a while, the keyboard buffer starts sending a random key and there is nothing you can do to stop it except reboot. Even exiting the game won't stop the effect.  Just be aware of that. The game is ho-hum for the genre, I am just trying to earn the card drops at this point.  If you are trying to earn them too, make sure you are not doing anything important while it idles, or perhaps leave the computer on without doing anything else.  You will see what I mean after about 30 minutes of it sitting there.			",218,98,14,28,23,2,33

												Well that sucks...  I bought two copies of this game just to play it with my roommate for a while and the multiplayer won't work. I've played games like terraria and stuff where servers are tricky. But this was not the case... the multiplayer just doesn't work. Also this game was made by a highschooler.			",145,13,6,5,9,0,6

												Does something strange to keyboard. I tested this before having to write this review, so it is something that should be looked into. Hopefully just a bug and not something malicious. After having it open for a while, the keyboard buffer starts sending a random key and there is nothing you can do to stop it except reboot. Even exiting the game won't stop the effect.  Just be aware of that. The game is ho-hum for the genre, I am just trying to earn the card drops at this point.  If you are trying to earn them too, make sure you are not doing anything important while it idles, or perhaps leave the computer on without doing anything else.  You will see what I mean after about 30 minutes of it sitting there.			",218,98,14,28,23,2,33

												More than just a solid top down arcade shooter.Its essentially Raptor on steroids which was a fantastic game back in the day.Revolution Ace has done all that Raptor has done so well and more. The slight RPG elements are a nice touch. The new weapons and abilities are all cool. The whole Ground vs Air target mechanic is nice gives it some depth. The guns having different facings depending on the slot you put them is also really cool. The levels look nice especially the water thanks to the Unreal Engine used. The game can be challenging and there's plenty of levels and a difficulty setting and just overall a great selection of variety and options to choose from.There's even coop.A game so good it pains me that I got it for 19 cents. it was a steal.

												You know I usually can find nearly at least one good thing about a game but here I cannot. Revolution Ace is a Vertical shooter in the vein of Raiden,Aleste and Star Solider...Too Bad the game play isn't even a speck towards those awesome shooters...let me explain why ""Revolution Ace"" sucks. First off,  The weapons you have are super weak and too expensive. Personally at first I thought it was neat to be able to experiment with what works for the player and purchase weapons to wreck havoc on enemies. However here is the fatal flaw with this is once you purchase and item and it happens to suck,you can sell it and get next to nothing back for that weapon and you better hope you have more funds because if you sold your old weapon to get the new one that you thought would work....You're screwed to the point were you will have to delete your game and start ALL over again. The weapons absolutely suck and This is bull*#$*! I had to restart 3 times to get anywhere and the more I play the game,the more I hate it because the balance between enemy and player are too great, the enemy is simply too strong!   Who thought the enemy movement games development was a good idea? Their TOO ERRATIC! What makes a vertical/horizontal shooter fun is the set enemy patterns so that the player can memorize and use a manuever to ensure survival and keep going. You can't do that here. All the enemies comes from all sides and pummel you with bullets and given the weak ♥♥♥ weapons and the prices given, Your defeat happens far too often (Some will say it's because I suck but I've beaten Raiden and Raiden 2 on hard with 7 credits!). You may not see the end of the game unless you pick the right weapons and upgrade carefully. If this was a game disc I'd probably snap it in half by now... I suppose I should talk about the little this game has going for it.  Music is good and some stuff you may hum to or tap your foot at. Nothing special but still kinda nice. 2nd is the game looks pretty good with nice scenery,nothing looks out of place and it is satisfying when you can blow up a ground unit or structure.  This game uses the Unreal engine so this would explain the good graphics (good,not great) Water effects are ♥♥♥♥♥in! Sadly...that's all the positives I could find. Controls blow and they are hard to set up and if you are using a PS2 controller the menu is nearly impossible to navigate due to the speed of the cursor.. Have fun trying to select ""Campaign""!     I really wanted to like this game. I wish the developer would do his homework on what makes a shooter awesome but RA falls flat due to unfair balance, Weapons too weak and expensive (no way to grind to get more cash or ""Scrap"" to buy weapons), stupid enemy patterns that no one can get around.....It frustrates me because I LOVE SHMUPS and this has the potentional to be a sleeper/underdog classic but it's a wasted oppurtunity. Stay away from this!!! you'll thank me later!			",143,6,3,14,9,0,5

												The description says, ""as you take down more and more of the AI’s fighter’s you’ll unlock new technologies"" but what it means is, ""you will have to fail the same levels over and over until you gather enough experience to unlock new technologies."" Maybe they designed it that way and maybe it would even be fun if the levels were better, but they're frustrating to play.One of the problems is that there are two spaces enemies can occupy - the ground and the sky. When the forces on the ground shoot missiles towards the sky, the graphics are so bad that you can't tell exactly when the missiles will reach the right height to hit you and when they're only half way there.It's also a shame that after spending so long developing this game, the designers didn't even bother to check their spelling and grammar. It's full of errors that make me them look like illiterate children.			",451,241,12,71,64,5,67

												For $.19 until 7/13 you cannot go wrong.  The way the game handles multiplayer vs. is very interesting in that you are each playing on your own boards and the things you are doing are impacting the enemies experience in a negative way a la Puzzle Fighter or something.  Pretty sweet mechanic!  If you are in to the classic 1943 style top down bullet hell shooters you will love this one.  It has the required snappy controls that make sure you feel responsible for messing up, and the included progression and inventory/loadout mechanic adds depth similar to what you enjoyed in choosing your loadouts in Gradius.I don't see why you wouldn't throw down the change on this if you are a lover of games, period. But, even for the full $4.99 I think you can have a great experienece solo, which is extended when you add in a friend. GL HF!			",194,76,2,42,17,2,44

												Starts off well, but totally unbalanced and relies on heavy grinding after a few levels.Enemies are way to strong to kill, too fast you can get tehm before they fly off screen and come back. Standard weapons are useless and you are swarmed before you know it. Knowing the attack patterns means nothing as your guns are too weak to do anything about it.  So you are left with being forced to grin the same level over and over again to level up to get strong enough to pass that stage.  Maybe multi player is better, it seems made for more thn one player, single player sucks ♥♥♥ it feels like a troll game.Waste of 15 pennies.			",464,147,9,48,66,7,61

												My friend bought this for me about a year ago. I tried to install it on my other laptop it said something about my graphic card. My new laptop still the same thing about 4 months ago. Installed it now and it works........So my friend bought this for me because we play touhou and wanted to play a bullet hell game together. More like I wanted to show off my touhou skills. I get into the game expecting it to have good music. It's alright but the same song is in every level I played. The bullets are way too tiny and the color yellow.... why yellow. I can't see it and I can see the tiny snow bullets Cirno throws at you. The background might change in the next few rounds. The only huge problem for me is the option to change the keys. I can't change my keys any button I click it won't change to it. So i try to get out of it. It change the key to mouse 1. So the game play it's alright but the ship flys faster than Sakuya and if you have a controller plug in your ship will fly to the left 100% of the time..... I don't know if you can hold down the shift or control key to shoot but I had to spam my control key a lot which gets me out of the game. I don't find this game fun. There is no patterns to the bullets :(			",63,11,0,10,3,0,1

tl;dr: A good raptor clone featuring a lot of customization and different game types, with a huge replay value and it's not hard to 100%.  Also, it's cheap. A great game, certainly underrated. As some have already mentioned, there are some similarities between this game and Raptor: Call of shadows. This game may look the same, but it doesn't FEEL the same at all. Like Raptor, this game has a lot of enemies (both in air/ground), encourage a lot of customization (regular weapons, special weapons/nukes and shields) and the core gameplay feels similar.But that's where the similarities end. Some of the enemies may behave a lot like the ones in raptor, but most of them don't. Some of them are really unique and original, and need different loadouts and strategies to defeat. Ground bosses, for example, can't be hit by air only weapons, so you have to set your loadout to fight them. And that leads to the second point: Customization. In this game you have A LOT of weapons to buy and equip. To do that you'll need to purchase them and equip it in your ship, to a maximum of 6 weapon slots that open when you level up. When you level up you can also unlock new weapons to buy.  But the customization do not stop at regular weapons, you can also equip different shields and special weapons to set your loadout in a unique combination. For example, you could equip a bulky shield (high armor, low recharge rate) and the shield booster superweapon (recharge 50% of the shield) to have a huge shield and to be able to recharge it fast. Also talking about customization, you get perks to choose when you level up. Those can add damage to specific weapon types (plasma, beam, missile...), armor, damage to buildings and more.One downside that many have mentioned is that in the beggining your ship feel really underpowered, and I have to agree with that. But when you gain levels, weapons, slots and perks, that gets better.The game also have a lot of different game modes: Campaign (around 20 missions if I recall correctly), Skirmish (free play the missions and other stages), versus (2 people play side by side, whoever dies first lose) and battle chains (pseudo multiplayer with score attack).If you clear the campaign. there is the +1 and +2 campaign, that are way harder, so it have a lot of replay value.For the completionists, it's not hard to get every achievement. Even the ones that require versus and battle chains can be unlocked by replaying your own battle chains, so you don't really need multiplayer to 100%.If that's not enough reason, this game is absolutely cheap. I mean, REALLY cheap. And even get on sale sometimes.			",111,24,3,8,2,2,4

												This is not a bad shmup by any means. However, there's one critical issue that is holding me back from recommending it: energy.In my opinion, a good shmup NEEDS to have energy. You must be the last hope for humanity, maybe witnessing your allies die in the opening cut-scene. The music needs to be pumping through your blood non-stop. Basically, the feel of the game MUST be energizing and insanely epic. This game just sort of says, ""Fight the bad guys if you want to... it's really not that big of a deal. The war isn't that important anyways. And I wouldn't even say 'war' since it's pretty much just a small 5-minute conflict between some American soldiers and a crazed Jihadist somewhere in Afghanistan."" What I mean by this is that there really isn't anything driving you to PILOT YOUR CRAFT THROUGH THE SWARMS OF ENEMIES, ANNIHILATING THE ENTIRE ARMY SINGLEHANDEDLY, SINCE YOU ARE HUMANITY'S LAST HOPE. It's just... boring.There are a bunch of cool game-modes (most of them multiplayer in some way) that I REALLY dig, but the lack of energy prevents me from enjoying the game. Tacking on some cool game-modes doesn't make the game exciting when it's in reality, pretty bland.The moral of the story is that you should just pass this one up. There are so many better shmups in the world, many of them right here on Steam. Crimzon Clover, the Tale of Alltynex, and, of course, the legendary Ikaruga. Those all have an insane amount of energy- play those first, and then you'll understand what I'm talking about here.There are definitely some good parts to this game that I have never seen before (and, consequently, highly respect the developers for) like the graphics and game-modes, but Revolution Ace just isn't worth your time. I went into this expecting a niche shmup that would satisfy my shmup-craving soul, but it isn't quite that. Shmup fans, look elsewhere (seriously, get those shmups I mentioned above NOW if you haven't already). If you aren't a shmup fan... don't let this be your first voyage into the amazing genre.

												I rate the game Revolution Ace 4/5.This game is extremely similar to the old Apogee game, Raptor: Call of the Shadows but is not implemented quite as well in some ways but it is much less expensive. The music and sound is mediocre and the graphics look pretty drab. The plot is insipid and uninventive. Cooperative (and uncooperative) multiplayer modes with another computer can be set up through steam but the process is unintuitive and a little bit tricky. Once you get it working however, the multiplayer modes work very reliably. The game's pace (and perceived rate of motion) is quite slow for the type of arcade-style action shooter game that it is. However, everything else about this game is very well done. The game has 4 difficulty levels and offers a more challenging version of itself to play after you beat the main campaign. Individual levels can be replayed easily. Playing any mode allows you to earn more monies for upgrading your airplane too and the upgrade and leveling system is well designed. The game also has a random mode which can give you a random fight above any terrain type you want. For just 5 dollars (without it even being on a special steam sale) this game is quite extensive and replayable.			",171,24,2,6,7,0,17

												Starts off well, but totally unbalanced and relies on heavy grinding after a few levels.Enemies are way to strong to kill, too fast you can get tehm before they fly off screen and come back. Standard weapons are useless and you are swarmed before you know it. Knowing the attack patterns means nothing as your guns are too weak to do anything about it.  So you are left with being forced to grin the same level over and over again to level up to get strong enough to pass that stage.  Maybe multi player is better, it seems made for more thn one player, single player sucks ♥♥♥ it feels like a troll game.Waste of 15 pennies.			",464,147,9,48,66,7,61

The game feels like a cheap copy of Raptor and does most of the things wrong.+ Game looks okay+ Didnt crash in the few hours it took me to beat it- Weapons dont have any punch to them, until you get the first powerful front firing beam weapon- Hard to tell if stuff is going to hit you when fired from ground enemies- There is 2 buttons to fire, one for air and one for ground targets, only one can be done at a time- Your ships hitbox is bigger than your shipTLDR: Get Raptor: Call of the Shadows and Tyrian 2000 if you want good games to play.

I'd recommend it for a buy at the 19 cent price point but I certainly wouldn't at the normal $5 price point, so this is a non-recommendation altogether.			",148,43,3,33,22,1,47

												Revolution Ace is a classic shooter game like the arcade games from the old gaming machines, just with better graphics.It's a typical arcade game where you play as a jet pilot and you just have to destroy all the other targets on the screen, in air and on ground. The storyline of the game is, hhhmmm, just don't care about the story, it's not worth to read the text in the campaign mod...While playing the game you can earn scraps and you can use them to upgrade your jet. You can buy different items for your jet and different weapons, including plasma and laser weapons. And you will need to update your jet, if you want to have a chance to complete the harder levels. To do so, there are 4 different gaming mods. You can play a campaign or you can do the skirmish where you can choose a level you want to play. If you want to play against other players, there's a versus and a battle chains mod.But even with some cons, this game is fun to play. Especially the hunt for all achievements is fun and the developers made it just in a right difficulty level to get them all.Summary:+fun for arcade lovers+upgrades for jet+perks for level update+multiple weapons+versus and multiplayer mod+soundtrack+low price+steam cards & achievements+nice badge-storyline-drag'n'drop bug in the shop-aiming issues with targets on the ground-not enough online player			",29,2,2,0,1,0,2

												I just paid 79 cents for this and 2 other games in the Hyperspace pack, and I'd pay 79 cents just for this.  I haven't even tried the other games yet, and I don't understand why people are complaining about this one.  This game is really fun; there's almost no learning curve, you can play it on a potato and if you were a gamer in the 80s and early 90s, this will bring you back there.  ""It's a ripoff of Raptor"" blah blah blah shut up.  Do you really think Raptor was the first of it's kind?  Guess what?  It wasn't.  Not even close.  Anyway, Revolution Ace is a lot of fun.  It isn't perfect, but it's basically 27 cents right now if you include the other 3 games, so why not try it?  Those of you spending mommy and daddy's money shouldn't be worried about how much it costs anyway.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Revolution Ace is a PC Shoot Em' Up that, as far as I can tell, tries to reconcile the differences between old school western shmups, where the right equipment saves the day, and new style shmups where location is everything, and hits are incredibly hard to come back from. It also tries to modernize itself with a league of features, some good, some bad. To give a quick, and concise conclusion to this review? I would PERSONALLY rate RA as a ""Maybe/When Cheap"" where you're paying cheap for the game itself. I got it for 20 cents, and my friend and I enjoyed ourselves. But for the majority of that time, we were enjoying each other's company in Co-op and not the game itself. Unfortunately, since Steam has only yes or no as an option, and I feel Yes is too strong an affirmation for this game, I'm picking no. Now I'll explain the Pros and Cons:Pros:- The game has functional co-op for the most part, and while I'm sure the Devs might argue otherwise, I feel it was built with co-op as a main intention. I believe enemy HP is cut down somewhat in single player and the ship number is based on difficulty and not whether or not it's SP or MP. Also, the way the gameplay works, it has encouraged teamwork between the two of us beyond ""both of you shoot at it until it dies.""- The game's versus ideas are great. The idea of being able to do offline challenge modes that escalate between you and your opponent, while done before, seems competently done. Direct versus is fun as you watch your partner do better or worse than you in certain areas, constantly trying to outdo one another's score and take advantage of competitive-only upgrades and modifications to equipment. Kudos to the dev for making their random levels work with this system as well by supplying the same seed to both clients.- The game DOES fill a niche that we haven't seen met recently. At the heart of it is a game that wants to be ""Raptor: Call of the Shadows"" if it were made today, with technological and game design advances. However, it can and DOES need improvement, the sort a Revolution Ace 2 would hopefully present.Cons:- The perk system hurts the game because you cannot respec them, either grind ridiculous hard to have all of them or start over with another profile. It also directly gates off better weapon variety, weapon slots on your ship, and eventually, objectively superior weaponry/equipment.- Weapons (and WEAPON SLOTS) being locked off by leveling means you don't actually do as much damage as you need to until you hit those high levels. And even then, it often doesn't feel like enough unless you've properly specced yourself. Another casualty of this is the feel of these weapons. They have generic sounds and since they don't tear through ships HALF as well as Raptor's or Tyrian's do? They not only feel weak, but are confirmed so. Complicate this with a A2G and A2A system where you specifically have to choose between the two (EVEN IF YOU HAVE WEAPONS THAT CAN DO BOTH, UNLIKE RAPTOR!) and the game makes you dance to its tune more than it needs to.- A regenerating shield system that attempts to harp Raptor but falls flat because it requires you to stop firing, a bad idea for the following reason. It would've been better to just make it regenerate if you avoid being hit for a while to let you choose between staying in the fray and keeping it from getting out of hand or waiting for half to full regeneration in relative safety.- Enemies come back again. Depending on the difficulty they can come back once, twice or thrice, or infinite times. You WILL have moments that feel less old school American shmup like Tyrian 2000 and more Japanese Bullet-Hell Shmup like Crimzon Clover, without the tiny hitbox grace that the latter trades off for dying on hit. Being overwhelmed is not only a very real possibility, it's a very real likelihood if you're not doing so well.-Some enemies are incredibly annoying to deal with. Later levels involve enemies that quickly fly across the screen spamming bullets. I can only imagine the nightmare of Nightmare Mode, where you're trying to hit them knowing they'd stick around indefinitely if you didn't.-Very inconsistent artstyle means you'll be facing enemies that look hobbled together from a variety of artists...because the credits demonstrate they WERE. This also means garbage like white bullets hidden by clouds and bright blue bullets that nearly match the background sky.-A pointless storyline. Yes, shmups are usually games that don't need a plot, but the random blurbs you get every few levels hint at a mastermind and/or cause between the malfunctioning war machines...but doesn't at all elaborate, instead constantly presenting WHODUNIT? possibilities. Having no plot at all is actually BETTER than that.-Their amazing water effects sounds great until you drop a super bomb on it and it goes through the grounds. They wanted to make that a special note? I'll make it a special one here.Overall it's a game that I feel is playable, outside of a few bosses who apparently don't have synced up attacks in co-op. But it's a game you'll play through and occasionally pick up again for co-op purposes, not a game you'll keep coming back for more. Hence why I'd rate it as a Maybe, but since there's no Maybe and the cons outweigh the pros, a No is a must.			",204,2,4,8,2,1,8

												Fast-paced throwback to the classic game Raptor. If you are a fan of shmups you'll definitely get enjoyment from this game. There are a large number of weapons and weapon types and even a skill-tree of sorts, so it pays to stick with one or two weapon types. I went with missiles and bullets and had some pretty kick-♥♥♥ heatseekers by the end of the game.On the downside, there are graphics problems. The game seemed to chug for me at high settings despite exceeding the recommended specs, and a bad frame-rate in a game like this equals death. So I had to knock the detail down, but no biggie.Recommended.			",94,1,1,2,7,0,11

												Crashes a lot. But its a good looking (because of the phyiscs engine) and has a lot of potential. If you are into shoot em ups, play this game. The only thing I dislike is the crashing, but hey, I picked up this game for .19 cents. Can't really complain.			",88,13,0,11,8,0,5
