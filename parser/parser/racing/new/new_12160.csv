												Midnight Club 2, good ol' racing game from the PS2 era and what is considered to be by some fans, including myself, as one of the best Midnight Club games in the series. I'll try to make this detailed without it being too lenthy, so let's get this started.If you enjoy racing games on the PC, this is one of those games you should definitely try out, especially since it's normally only $10. Mind you, the game is almost 11 years old as of this review, so comparing it to modern-day racing games and reviewing based on that would be silly, right? For it's time, it's a very fun-filled and possibly addictive game with fast cars and racers who are willing to give you a run for your money, or the occasional cops super speeding to prevent you from winning the race. Three cities, Los Angeles, Paris, and Tokyo, and racers on the streets every night waiting for a challenger to follow them to the start of the race, Career Mode is worthwhile once you get the rivals' cars and break top speeds with them. As you progress, you'll have more access to cars to run around in Cruise in Arcade Mode. The physics are very loose, and to a certain degree, exaggerated, but that only adds to the fun of driving around the streets, dodging traffic cars and clearing checkpoints. There's several other things you can do while playing the game, but I'll talk about that another time. Besides, who doesn't like going at their top speed, hitting the nitrous, and hitting local pedestrians that walk around for you to hit them while racing, or cruising? Don't worry, they all live anyway, even if they don't ever move again. Also, the soundtrack is pretty damn good, and it seems that every racer has their own songs that you'll race in with them, and then listen to later after you beat them. Being an old game, I wasn't expecting the graphics to be as clean as they are. They must've re-added some nice quality textures at some point in the recent years, because it looks very clean for an aged game like this!Even though the game is very enjoyable to Midnight Club fans, it can be at times annoying difficult, or give you one of those ""WTH"" moments for anyone. Probably because I still haven't gotten my MC2 Driver's License yet (I might have made that up), I've played this game on the consoles for years, and still tend to find certain parts of the game to be a pain at times, learning the controls on the PC only adds to it. For anyone who plays this game, those moments could be from heavy traffic, hitting poles that stops your car completely and, if you're lucky, send your car's back end up in the air, getting tipped over from cutting certain corners or oversteering with the wrong car at certain terrain, and let's not forget the occasional driver who doesn't use their blinkers before switching lanes. For newer players, you may have to learn the whole track before you can increase your chance of winning certain races, because sometimes checkpoint arrangements can offer too much freedom to where you miss a shorter route or have no clue where to go, or you miss it because you were a few inches away from the checkpoint radius. Oh, almost forgot about the multiplayer! It's...... dead, understandably. Overall, the game would have to take some getting used to, but it can be very joyful while you do it, especially if you're a racing gamer who just loves driving around in fast cars. And for that reason, I recommend this to those who are into these kind of games! Like I said earlier though, it's an old game, from 2003, so if I see any of you badmouth it and say it's not as good as Need for Speed: Rivals or Most Wanted (either one), I'll take out one of my earned cars from MC2 and run you over with it!Sincerely,Totally Not a Die Hard Midnight Club Fan K9_Rage			",31,3,14,4,1,2,0

												I will be the first to confirm that this runs on Windows 8.1; I will also confirm that will support custom resolutions. I would assume that this game would support 1080p and 4k as it seems to grab video resolutions via your GPU driver. This game, however, seems to be designed to run at 640x480, as some HUD elements such as the arrow, are centered to that arrangement.This game has aged rather well, even if the cutscenes haven't. I can't say much more other than I wrote this to confirm compatibility with Windows 8.1, but I would recommend you buy it, especially if you find it at $2.49 USD.http://puu.sh/ip5tt.png is an example of the incorrectly centered HUD elements.

												This arcade style, city-navigation, character driven, jumptastic racing game is the only game I have with mouse steering and I miss it in every other driving game. And a lot of tight streets in the cities of this game require the detailed and quick steering a keyboard can never offer. Maybe the people who are buying hardcore driving simulations already have a wheel but certainly mouse steering should be standard in any game looking to appeal to a broad audience. Because the controls in Midnight Club 2 are simply superb, the game mechanics and driving feel are perfectly balanced for fun and a challenge. To start off you might be just holding down the gas the whole way, but eventually with extremely power cars and navigating the city, the driving does feel like actually racing through a living city, just one designed for lots of jumps and high speed cornering. Some cars you will use the brake, others the handbrake instead, but getting around fast is genuinely enjoyable. And with each car having its own style, you get to chose how you'd like to play. The cars get better as the game progresses, making it part of the game to drive a few different cars or seeing how far your favorite car can get you. Once you finish the story, you can start over with all the cars unlocked. You get three cities that each have unique neighborhoods with nice feel to them, but more importantly, huge jumps and long curves and straights for racing. The traffic can get in the way a lot of the time, but you can avoid them by going through the jumps or hidden sections of town that cut around underground, making learning the map sometimes a necessary frustration, and sometimes a ton of fun.

												A great arcade-style racer. The game becomes delightfully (and sometimes frustratingly) challenging once you reach Paris and Tokyo. As a helpful tip, it is not always necessary to use the vehicle you've recently won to defeat the next racer. This aspect of the game is especially useful when doing Tokyo races and facing the World Champion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												EDIT: Check out https://github.com/LRFLEW/OpenMC2TL;DR: This might be one of the best Arcade Racers out there. However, the PC port is quite broken. If you play this version, use a 360 Controller, use a keyboard for the menus, make sure to remap the controls to something that makes sense, use driver settings to force AA/AF/VSync if you want them, and be prepared for the occasional crash. If you don't want to deal with these issues, then try to find a copy of the PS2 version.Midnight Club 2 is the second and (in my opinion) best game in the Midnight Club series. The Midnight Club series has often been compared to the Grand Theft Auto series as they share the same publisher. However, these are two very different game series. Midnight Club is much more focused on being a racing game, whereas Grand Theft Auto is a much more open ended game with a lot more than just racing. This often makes the Midnight Club games a much better racing experience, as all of the development time has been put into making the racing as best as it can be.The racing itself is very tight and controlled. There's never any time where you feel like the game isn't responding to your input. The game has you race at very fast speeds, but your turns feel tight and drifting is powerful and fun. Through the early game, you unlock different abilities that slowly increases what you can do in the races. Each of these abilities is simple to understand and is well balanced. All of the abilities, along with the games great control, makes for interesting and varied gameplay.It's important to mention the unlocks system in this game. Some games use a shop system that allows you to buy and upgrade cars you like. Midnight Club 2, however, uses a linear unlock system where you unlock new cars by winning races and you don't upgrade cars. This is a different system from other racing games, even other games in its own series, but I think it helps to focus the game. Instead of trying to win races to unlock money to get better cars, you win races for the races themselves. Some people may not like that, but it's one of the reasons I think this game is great.The races themselves are open checkpoint style. That means that while you're required to go through all the checkpoints in order, the game allows you to take any path you want between them. This means that finding the right path and shortcuts to take is just as important as driving fast. There are even a handful of races that allow you to hit the checkpoints in any order you want, opening up the game and letting you experiment on what route gives you the best chance to win. This makes it so that when you have to restart a race because you lost, you don't necessarily feel like you are stuck. With maps that allow for a lot of shortcut opportunities and varied routes, there is always another, possibly better route you can try.There are three relatively large maps in this game, each one modeled after a different city. Los Angeles is probably the most varied in terms of road types, ranging from small, windy paths to city blocks to high-speed highways to construction sites with lots of ramps to jump off of. Paris has a lot of shortcuts that makes finding your path a lot of fun, along with the catacomb system and numerous large jumps that makes the city feel very open. Tokyo is a bit more mundane than the other cities, but since you get there late in the game when races go well over realistic speeds, you will be happy for the larger roads that makes it easier to dodge traffic and other racers. Each city feels unique, with different environment textures and building making them visually distinct and varied layouts making them play differently.The characters in this game fall flat. Many of them are stereotypes from all over the world added in an attempt to make the game feel more worldly. However, this backfires in many places, with the characters often feeling more like caricatures than actual people. However, they really only play a small role in the game, with only short introductory scenes before each race and the occasional and ignorable quip during the races. Luckily, there is no player character, so there's no single annoying character that carries you through the game.This game is very difficult, but isn't unfair. This is because the game has a very slow and approachable learning curve. If you've never played a racing game before, this game starts easy enough to get you into it. If you're already a good racer, than you can fairly easily blow through the first easy races and start getting to the more challenging races. If you're really good, then you might need some patience to through the easier races, but trust me, there is a challenge waiting for you in this game. The last few races are brutally difficult and require many, many attempts to beat, but the difficulty smoothly increases, so you never hit any real difficulty spike.Midnight Club 2 is, in my opinion, the best in the series. Midnight Club: Street Racing (the first in the series) didn't really know what it was doing, having much slower races and no abilities like the slipstream turbo to make the gameplay more varied. Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition suffered in a lot of weird ways. The lackluster upgrade system, a poor sense of progression, and an unnecessary amount of motion blur makes it much less fun to play than its predecessor. Midnight Club: Los Angeles (the forth in the series) is one of the better racing games out there, but suffers from a fairly broken upgrade system that lets you get the best vehicle in the game by the time your half way though, leaving the rest of the game to just be a grind. Midnight Club 2 is also the only game to get a PC port, so none of the other games in the series is available on Steam anyways.Speaking of PC ports, this game certainly has some trouble on the platform. First of all, this game needs to be played with a controller. The keyboard controls do not provide the control needed, and the mouse controls are just too awkward to use. However, the controller support in this game is kind of broken. I've had success with the Wireless 360 Controller, so I recommend using that. Some controllers (the PS4 controller for example) causes an odd bug where the menus think that the center of the joystick is the top-left corner, causing the menu selection to uncontrollably scroll. I can't say for every controller out there if this happens or not, so be careful before buying. In addition, the default controller mappings are quite broken, but you can manually remap the controls. Note, however, that it doesn't support ""analog buttons"", so you can't use the 360 controller's triggers as buttons. Additionally, it lacks many graphical settings, like AntiAliasing, Anisotropic Filtering, and VSync, so you will need to turn them on from your driver if you want them. The game also has a number of smaller issues that may not be worth naming, but can impact your playing experience (some of which is dependent on your resolution). If you want to play this game, but don't want to deal with this port's issues, then I'd recommend playing the PS2 version. There’s also an Original Xbox port, but there’s no compatibility for the 360.In the end, I’d recommend this game. It’s one of the best Arcade Racers I’ve ever played, and is even the game that got me into the genre. I do highly recommend you pick it up, but do be weary of the quality of this port.

												Midnight Club 2 is an older PS2 game, meaning it will hardly look pretty by today's standards, but it has a kinda solid career mode, and the free roam is just kind of fun. Having to unlock everything can be a bit of a chore though, and I found that the best way to experienbce this game is by using the cheat code 'rimbuk' (without the quotation marks) which unlocks everything, unlimited Nitrous and MISSILES in free roam. It's kind of a laugh to mess around with. However, I thinkyou should wait for a sale, £6 is a bit much.(Also it does Support WIndows 7/8)			",125,11,35,5,12,2,9

												One of Rockstar's little gems.As a big fan of Midnight Club 3, I was glad to see the previous title on steam. When i first played it, I misjudged the great potential this game has, maybe because it wasn't as easy as MC3, but thanks to the Evolve community I gave this game a second try and, wow, what a trip that was.Midnight Club 2 isn't your average racing game, it has custom tracks (playable online), power-ups, difficulty, police chases, non-linear paths and even cheats, the soundtrack is amazing, I just wish I could listen to the entire soundtrack everywhere (you can only listen to certain tracks depending on which city you are in). It also has deafening intros and movies so beware headphone owners, it's better to adjust the volume from Windows.The career works this way: there are ""bosses"" that you have to defeat, sometimes thrice because of unexpected events, before you can get your hands on their cars. Unfortunately, there aren't many bosses in this game, so the career as a result is pretty short.The online is where the fun is at, you can play with other 7 players on every track there is on the game plus those created by players, if you want to play online only, I suggest you to put the following cheat: 'rimbuk', it unlocks all the cars.The conclusion is: whether you are here to buy it for the story mode or for the online, expect fun gameplay and amazing vehicles.<The game works on Win7 and 10 but you can't play it in multiplayer, because Gamespy has closed. You can, however, play on LAN parties sometimes hosted on Evolve or Tunngle.>			",822,207,24,118,74,7,110

												Midnight Club 2 is a terrific racing game. There's just something exhilirating about the mayhem of racing through crowded streets, occasionally crashing, trying to get back up to speed. There's just something awesome and unique about each of the characters' personalities, their reactions before and after racing, and their sharp insults during the race.I used to play this game when I was a lot younger. I have bought this game for the nostalgia. This game does not disappoint!10/10 Rockstar! Thank you so much for an awesome racing game!Additional Notes: This game works perfectly well on Windows 8. This game runs very smoothly in comparison to many other games.Also, the GameSpy servers are dead. However, the Midnight Club 2 servers have been transferred to ""GameShare"" thus online gameplay is now possible.

												Great story line through fun maps based on real cities. Gets very challenging towards the end. Car controls aren't the most realistic, but after some practice they feel great.Bikes seem a bit of an afterthought and in many situations feel overpowered (Perhaps realistic?)There is a huge amount of content here with many cut scenes. if you can get past the rough models and textures (by todays standards) and detatch yourself from the realistic car machanics of more modern games this is a real hidden gem.I love this game, but I have been playing it since it came out all those years ago on PS2.

												THIS GAME WORKS PERFECTLY ON WINDOWS 7.Don't know what the steam alert was for, good thing I looked through the community reviews though.Midnight Club 2, where to start with...I've had this game on PS2, so that's old. Yeah, old, but frankly it's a jewel.In terms of challenge, MC2 is quite a hard game. The ""story"" mode, featuring characters who incarnate clichees from the whole world, inside the street racing universe, will get you to face opponents in the middle of the traffic, following absolutely insane tracks. MC2 doesn't work with straight roads, instead you have to follow checkpoints which actually makes the track. Some races are even ""freeways"", which means you can pass the points in any order (and those will need more training to get out of them victorious, particularly near the end). Now one thing I loved was that every car has its own handling. You will feel a difference between each car you drive, that it be in speed, acceleration, handling, drift or even weight (I insist on this one, since sometimes the AIs can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. I'm looking at you, Haley.) But the feeling of reward once you beat a racer has for only simbling the feeling when you beat a boss in Dark Souls. The police might also come during certain races, but other than just trying to get in your way while ordering you to pull over with a distinctive accent depending on which city you race, they don't do too much.In terms of fun, MC2 has everything you need. Speed down the streets of Paris, Los Angeles and Tokyo at up to 402 km/h, driving from busy main streets to the catacombs of Paris, jumping over the Seine or drifting near the castle of the emperor; those things you can do, either in races or in cruising mode. Because yes, there is a freeroaming mode in which you can just drive freely wherever you want, traffic or not. You can even create races by placing checkpoints and play them with AIs! If it wasn't that fun enough, there's even a mode wherein you can activate items. You know, those Mario kart-ish things where you gain power-ups like machinegun, rockets and whatnot. Or you can just type savethekids in the cheat section to gain a machinegun on the light button as well as rockets on the honk command - unless they changed the codes on PC, I have no idea about that.In terms of optimization, I've seen some complaints but for me, the game runs perfectly. However, I would strongly recommend a pad to play it. I had no problem playing with a xbox360 gamepad, and each control can be binded by the game menu (whatever some reviews said, this worked perfectly for me.)So yeah. MC2 is a must have for anyone who's fond of racing game. So go ahead and keep racing, shrimp!			",148,4,8,14,8,0,4

												In a lot of ways, it's an incredible game. It got out in 2003, same year as NFS: Underground and 2 Fast 2 Furious movie came to light, ergo the highest point of the street racing hype. MC2 and Underground were the first succesful big ones to ride that tide.In my social circles, at the end it all came down to ""which one of the two translates 'dat Fast and Furious feel' better"". And this question is a bit trickier than it seems at first. While Underground got that slick visuals and style, bullet proof design (advanced tuning + short but intense races), not to mention being succesful reboot of the huge NFS name, Midnight Club 2 offered much more intricate approach to, well, racing. Which lead to constant creation of different ""oh, ♥♥♥♥"" moments and accidents. In my opinion, a lot of them added a bit more of the Fast and Furious franchise ferocity than an endless raw of drag racing showdowns from Underground.Basically, every race in MC2 is a checkpoint rush. A twist - it all happens in a sandbox level. So your route from point to point doesn't matter while you've hit all of them and finished first. Throughout the game, this simple concept is being fumbled with constantly, presenting you each time a race with a slightly different freedom degree - from a ""there's the only straightforward route you can take to win"" to ""here's a bunch of checkpoints on your map, clear them all as fast as you can, using any route or technique AND in any possible order"". Dence traffic and AI racers (who also pick different routes) make sure that every race has some degree of chaos, typically. In general, that's it. And you'd be surprised how much fun it can deliver.As I see it, there are two major additional points. First, semi-scripted events. Now and then, something happens: say, a truck blocks a way right after that checkpoint. It does that every time in the same way, but what do YOU do with that is, again, up to you. Evade? Drive under it? Make a U-turn and pick a neighbour street? Whatever, just finish first. That and some smart, tight level design (shortcuts, jump ramps etc.) and AI competitors together keep game's chaotic nature fit. No matter how good you know the map and that specific route, every time there's a chance something of the above will intervene, screw everything up and make you rethink your tactics. Such things also spawn those bright, memorable moments, like a car flying just over another car while jumping from the ramp - or crashing into each other and making a huge traffic mess.Second, game has bikes and, subsequently, bikes-only and mixed ""bikes-cars"" races. They present a noticeable shift in gameplay mechanics, although it's more of an intermission for the main cars-only play. Still, bikes have their moments.Sadly, openworld brings the most of MC2's cons, too. Naturally, it's just not that good-looking with all the resource hunger of the big spaces, especially placed near Underground (which is exactly the same age but looks way better). Also, more open space needs more complicated AI, therefore it will glitch, sometimes a lot. There are other problems (e.g. different vehicles are too similar to control, some arcade flicks like two wheels riding feel unnecessary and underbaked), but they are minor compaired to visuals and AI.Still, in my opinion Midnight Club 2 is a decent game, that brought a lot of hours of fun to me more than 10 years ago. It's core gameplay is solid even now. And while its looks have aged not nearly as well, I absolutely advise to give it a chance. Doubt not, ""she's still got it"".P.S. And yes, it works with Windows 7 just fine.			",278,81,9,19,13,1,28

												Midnight Club 2 Is an awesome game, It is an old one, but still awesome. If you are into racing or just messing around, this game is for you, It has a good campaign mode which is very challenging. It DOES work on my Windows 7 so dont worry. A major downside is that GameSpy servers shut down, which means you can only do LAN or hamachi ;(. It also has many glitches to explore and fun minigames in arcade mode. There are even cheat codes in the options section where you can, well, do cheats! The code: rimbuk unlocks everything. If you dont mind that its a bit dated (2003), and the graphics, then it's worth it			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Midnight Club 2 is definitely one of the better of the early-2000s arcade racing games. I originally played it on the PS2, and I must say it has aged well.The graphics, to begin with, are definitely not bad. They're nothing to write home about of course, but the texturing is pretty nice, and the only thing that really stands out as being old is the rather blocky look of some of the buildings.The controls for the cars & bikes are pretty good. It actually takes a bit of skill to deal with bikes [you will initially find yourself crashinf very easily]. And each of the cars available to unlock will have it's own quirks that you can use to your advantage, once you figure them out. One thing that stands out in this game is that you can actually flip your car in any direction [when it's in the air], and many arcade racers of this era had you stuck horizontal to the ground.One of the areas this game is, maybe not bad, but definitely odd, is with the AI. Oftentimes the public traffic seems almost scripted in the way that a massive truck happens to come out of an intersection just as you turn the corner and slam right into it. Or it might just be coincidental. This seems pretty neat at first, but it soon gets a bit tiring as you know it's going to be coming, so you can plan it away in advance.Also, the opponent AI is strange. They seem very apt to crash and swerve into traffic at when they go at high speeds [altough it's worth noting you can set the difficulty of the game manually, see the game guides and forums for details on this]. And in the ""free roam"" races, I find that regardless of which route you take, the opponents do worse if you're following them. Which makes me think that they're unaffected by traffic if you're not there to make it render. A bit of  ahandicap for you as the player, but I guess it just adds a challenge.Also, if you're going to use a controller, you may have a hard time navigating the menus. If you're using an xbone|360 controller, hold DPAD L+D, and use X to select items. You'll know what this means when you get to it. Alternatively, look into xinput to keyboard mapping software.So to summarize that, this is definitely one of the better ""old arcade racing"" games, but it's obviously got its problems. If you're only interested in newer stuff, then avoid it, but if you don't mind it being slightly dated, then go for it. You'll have fun.			",171,91,5,6,15,0,12

												First of all, let me start off by saying my ""Yes"" for the recommendation is more like a ""HELL YES!"".  I remember picking this gem up from my local game store some 12 years ago and it is today one of my favorite games of all time and  my favorite racing game ever.  You don't need 4K graphics and insane shaders to make a game amazing.  You need it to be like this ♥♥♥♥ right here.  If you like racing games but have never played this one or you don't like it, stop playing racing games, shut the ♥♥♥♥ up, and go get a job at Walmart making $11.50 an hour and pray every year you work there for the rest of your life you get promoted to manager to make $13.00 an hour.  This is an insanely great game, even though it doesn't have actual car brands who gives a ♥♥♥♥?  Obviously not the other people who like this game (which out weighs the people who don't in the reviews by, let's just say a lot).			",91,3,2,5,8,0,1

												If you like street racing in real-life modern day cities like Los Angeles, Paris, Tokyo, then you'll enjoy this classic installment of Midnight Club II. Not that many players online(pretty much dead), but don't let that stop you from enjoying hours of high speed street racing and hot pursuits chases againts cops(that is, only when play street races). You'll enjoy this game more if you have the ""MODern Editiion"" mod on it. Cars transforms into their actual real life selfs with their actual names, Cars are twice as fast, adds 4 unqiue vinyls, rims, colors, and a great custom hud. So, like i said before earlier, if you like racing in real life cities, then buy Midnight Club II in my opinion. Still a good classic :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game just never gets old, It has always been with me since I was so little..The Soundtrack is spectacular in my opinion, it keeps your adrenaline running making the game so intense when racing. It has *almost* everything you would want in a racing game with the exception of customization(sadly ;c other than color change) which are: >Free Roam!>Amazing music(I mentioned earlier) If you don't like it at first, wait till you get to Paris and Tokyo c;> Characters that make you want to leave them in the dust because of their lines or encourage you to try harder to become the world champ. >The Car models are based off of real-life vehicles and Rockstar did such an amazing job with them that I seem to like some of the designs of them on here than in real-life. c;>WARNING: This game will not be friendly with you, its difficulty will make you rage at times and never have I raged at a game except this one. So frustrating. At the moment I'm playing it on howhardcanitbe 9 and that is the hardest difficulty and holy, its tough. Fun Fact:""Because of this game, My father never plays video games anymore."">Addicting! I still play this game to this day and it never does get old, which is why I nominate this game as The ""Test of Time"" Award.>It does have Controller/Steering Wheel support! You might just have to fight a bit with the menu, but it works great!>Good visuals for its time, remember this game is nearly 14 years old! If you want a little touch to it, you can use SweetFX and it makes the lights stand out and the coloring of the game match with its surroundings making it close to the PS2 graphics.>You love messing around with cheats? Well, this one has some great ones such as Rocket launchers and machine guns fired from the hood of your ride!>I highly recommend this game to any racing fans or just about anyone! Now, what are you waiting for? Come on and Buy it already!10/10 In my opinion  /  9.5/10 since the only thing this game was missing was customization!			",69,7,9,3,3,0,1

I've almost completed the game and its fun!However then you have to consider the fact that it will bite you. Trust me when I say this it will get you frustrated, but still dosnt change the fact that this is a good game.Also this game DOES NOT SUPPORT CONTROLLERS.Its a bumer I know but still its something that shouldnt make you avoid the game entirely. I recomend this game if your skilled at driving and if you can stand up against all the bumps there are in the game. Enjoy! :)Update: ONE MORE THING.. Steering wheels really does work. :DHowever sadly theres a few downs such as fighting the menu, but my friend did use the steering wheel! So just wanted to point that out... Have fun racers!

												EDIT: Now that Steam has public 'reviews' for games, I figured I shoud rewrite this for public information.Midnight Club 2 is a fun, flashy arcade racing game released in 2003. What you're looking at here is wild speed boosted racer with TONS of replay value w/ plenty of 23 cars to choose from, races, courses, game modes, in three cities (Los Angeles, Paris and Tokyo), which also applies to the (pretty dead) online mode which also increases the amount of replay value with custom races. It's insanely easy to pick up and play with no kind of learning.Story Mode / Carrer Mode in this game isn't exactly 'story' based, nor connected to anything, you rather just beat challenge by challenge in order to progress with better cars and move to other cities. The further you get, the more cars you have unlocked and ready to use in any game mode. Racing in this game is a very arcade like experience, 'wonky' steering, air physics, and etc. Races are checkpoint powered (which is obvious) which can go from head to head racing to beat the clock racing. Sometimes their'll also be races where you're able to choose your own path to get to one checkpoint and back to the start. The map design also helps. In LA to Tokyo, you have cities that are filled with hidden paths, shortcuts, and alt paths to help you race to victory. The sound in this game is very basic, but it's what'd you expect in a racing game. There's a very nice and memorable soundtrack collection in this game (as long as you have love for Electronic and Rap / Hip Hop) that differs from all three Cities. LA with Hip Hop / Rap and Electronic / House, Paris with House / Techno (that's a genre guise), and Tokyo with Trance / Hard Dance and some ambient tracks. (Please correct me if I'm wrong about the genres!)The enviroment and graphical capabilities isn't much compared to now, but it was something very nice in 2003. The frame rate isn't hard locked (I don't recall it being hard locked at least), shiny cars, detailed enviroments, and so on.What makes me so happy about this game though, is the evolution of Midnight Club. Midnight Club: Street Racing was a pretty damn mediocre racing game but was addicting to play, though it was just missing tons of features and was very slow. What I really love is that Angel Studios (which is now Rockstar San Diego) completely upgraded the code of the original game which managed to turn into this, and I love the direction they went, and how much the production value of the game went up compared to the last they had.You should also check out the latest Midnight Club game if you own an Xbox 360 or PS3, Midnight Club: Los Angeles. (which I wish was on PC....I hope they make another on the PC platform!)Now, as I said in the original review:Buy it. It's fun, original, and it's worth what you're paying even for a 2003 video game.			",131,6,12,12,3,0,5

												Compatibility: I ran the game for a very short time on Windows 10, with a 6600k and R9 280 and it started and ran without problems. No crashes or glitches. I only played through getting Moses' car, however.I purchased this while on sale for $3.49 simply for the nostalgia. I played 3: DUB Edition and DUB Edition Remix before playing this one, both on the PlayStation 2, and while the later games are better graphically, have licensed vehicles, and more customisation, this game is definitely more of a challenge. If you want a classic fun racer that will all but have you ripping your hair out due to difficulty, this definitely a great buy on sale. Maybe I just suck at this game, but many other racers I've played are a cakewalk compared to this one. Either way, this is great. Amazing pickup on sale.If Rockstar would take break from adding to GTA 5, and maybe give us another Midnight Club and even a Red Dead Redemption sequel that both made it to PC, I would buy both in a heartbeat.

												This game will punish you from start to finish. This game won't help you win. This game will always give the worst scenario for you to race. This game is based on ""David vs. Goliath"", where you always will be the weak part of the grid. And this game will let you know how's the sensation of running in vacuum-cleaner speeds.We didn't had the DUB Edition, which is a SHAME. But you don't have faster options anywhere else on PC neither. Just get this and go race.			",71,6,28,3,2,0,2

												This game is my favourite game series ever. Midnight Club II still stands the test of timeThis game was great when it came out and it still is, it has great car replicas, well designed cities, well thought out character personalities and a great racing engine. MCII still has online multiplayer which works quite well with the spywatch severs patch and current-gen console controllers are compatible with the game. The game is also able to run with Windows 8 or Windows 10. This is a game worth buying full price for as I did, but it does go on sale for about $2.49. It's also easy to play the game for hours on end with it's amazing game mechanics, beautiful soundtrack and it's spectacular city designs. 11/10 childhood game of the decade turned young adult game of the decade.

												this is one of those hidden gems of a racing game you found as a kid when the ps2 was dominating, you picked it up and said ""huh this looks fun"" so you convinced your parents to buy this game for you. you played it and while playing you thought ""holy crap this is hard"" but you pushed through because the game was really fun, you fought against many people to go up against dice, and try your ♥♥♥ off to beat his final race, and when you do, you go ""hell yeah i finally beat him!"" only to realize that their are more maps, i wont spoil them, but they are amazing. This game is my favorite racing game of all time, right next to burnout. seriously this game is only 10 dollars now, pick it up if you are a hardcore racing fan not afraid to break a few controllers.

												Okay game, streeet racing version of Midtown Madness, just sayin that 3 was better. Bring that one over with the Remix Edition to the PC. I'm tired of playing the Xbox version. Midnight Club L.A. was fine, but 3 was the peak. Though 3 was my first game I played in the series, 2 is still alright now that I've played it. Random (aka unordered, pick which you want first) checkpoint races ruin the series throughout, though.Also, it works fine on my Windows 7, don't let the warning fool you. I also got it for free from joining the Rockstar group a while back, doesn't work to join now, though. So, I didn't put any money at risk, so see if you want it after watching a few videos.Three-point-fahv outta fahv.			",572,113,10,45,27,4,37

												This one is a VERY classic racing game! And great too!Different than MC:3 and MC:LA, you can't customize your car, but your progress don't depend on the tuning of the car and yes in the habilities of the player. But this is cool because the player and the racers cars isn't too much different than the traffic like you can see in those 2 mencioned games, giving a balanced graphicThis game gets harder and harder when you advance levels, specially when you try to beat Savo (What made many people stop playing this game)So, if you want a good racing game with a very high challenge at a low price, pick this one :D8,5/10			",63,2,6,5,4,0,1

The game was originally released in 2003, so if your computer can't run it nowadays, you should cry.With this game's old age, you can also expect the following lack of features to this game:Fullscreen Only (No window mode or borderless fullscreen option available)Wonky controller support (modern Xinput devices operate awkward upon initial launch, may have to adjust controls yourself)Online play is dead (unless you obtain a modified client)Other than that, it's just as I remember it, like on the PS2 so long ago...Although I think the AI in this version can sometimes get a little... stupid.For a game that came out in 2003, if you fondly remember this title, the $10 asking price is perfect. Otherwise, wait for the game to go on sale for $5 or less. ",224,49,9,33,18,2,14

												This is the PC port of the old PS2 classic Midnight Club II.  I absolutely adored the first midnight club.... probably more than any of the rest, due to pure nostalgia.  This game, despite the warning of not working with Windows 7 or above, has no issues running on my Win7 x64 system.I just wish Need For SPeed Underground 2 would pop up on Steam, then the racing classics would be complete, imo.  Midnight Club 3 included.Recommended for a shot of classic, yet fun racing- 128-bit system era			",149,8,8,13,10,0,6

												It is an ok game, but lacks very much. If you want to play some older racing games on PC, I highly recommend need for speed underground 2 or need for speed most wanted (2005). This game uses arrow keys as controls and has an awkward feel to the controls. Graphics are okay for a game of its time, gameplay is ok, but can lack at times. It is an okay game, not good, but not really bad. If you really want to play this game, it's neccessary that you play it with an xbox 360 usb gamepad.			",111,9,9,6,12,1,3

It's an old racing game where you can tune your cars and street race much like NFS: Underground series but with abit worse in graphics. No real cars. If you got the money and like these types of games, then do buy it. However if you want a racing game nowdays you can end up with something alot better me thinks. Not a bad game per say, can't really recommend it tho (Even if i got it for free, again, Thanks & Sorry the same time Rockstar!)			",228,42,16,26,55,1,50

												Midnight Club 2 definately shows it's age, and was Rockstar's second attempt at breaking into the racing genre. Naturally this market was dominated at the time by Need for Speed and Gran Turismo so it had to offer something unique to the table.Unfortunately it doesn't really do anything particularly unique. It doesnt have car customization, a track editor or anything to make it stand out. Its graphics also look dated for the time, considering Need for Speed Most Wanted came out 2 years later and looked infinitely better.It also features a lack luster stereotypical soundtrack. Something you'd expect to see straight out of a Fast and Furious movie. This was something the Need for Speed games didn't do, and for the most part had interesting and better sounding music.There are better racing games then this, far better. It comes off as flimsy and impotent, especially today.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Maybe it was just me, but even getting this game for free I wasn't that impressed by it. There's a lot of racing to be done in this game, but the controls feel a little too...arcade-y for me to enjoy, and there's no real sense of speed at all. Graphically, the game is sub-par even given the time it came out, the audio leaves something to be desired, and the AI? They're almost perfect to a fault. I thought maybe it was some form of rubber band mechanics that existed, but they just drive really well. There is absolutely zero room for error, unless you can take them out.Overall, I've played much better racing games, and this one should be left to die.			",106,25,1,18,12,0,6

												This game is horrible due to one single reason and that is the controls.The game is practically unplayable with keyboard. You can try to play this game, but it is horribly frustrating because the cars oversteer horribly, controls are imprecise and neither of these can't be adjusted. The only possible solution might be console controller for PC, but most of us PC gamer's don't own that usually useless device and therefore this game is unplayable to majority. I am sometimes maybe even too persistent and kept playingwith keyboard as long as I could but the AI drivers in this game are very good and that combined with horrible controls means that sooner or later the game becomes impossible to proceed any further.The gameplay itself was relatively identical to the Midtown Mandess series and was ok, but due to the utterly outdated graphics I don't believe that I would have enjoyed the game even if the controls had worked.Grade: 0/10 due to being unplayable at least without controller and even if the controls had worked I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.EDIT1. Why this review has received so many thumbs down from audience? It is a fact and not an opinion that this game is unplayable with keyboard. So, next time someone gives this review thumbs down, please leave a comment. If you don't know how to leave comment, follow this short tutorial: Click the big red thumb down button that I gave to this game. This brings you to new window (unless you are already in the whole view full review mode) where there is a field below this review into which you can write your comment.EDIT2: Finally someone (in this case user named Ƨcotch) commented this review and according to him the demo of this game was playable with keyboard. There isn't a demo availalbe on steam (at least at the time I was writing this on 15.1.2014) but here is a link for the demo on Rockstars' website http://www.rockstargames.com/midnightclub2/downloads.htmlAnyways I find it odd that someone could find the handling accpetable. Below are some quesses for possible explanation:A) In the demo the keyboard controls are not broken. (I didn't play the demo so I don't know)B) The cars in demo are so slow that they are possible handle to at least some degree. (I remember that the handling was really bad but the game was not totally unplayable in the beginnning of the game because cars were slower as well as AI drivers. Situation changed as the campaing progressed)C) The game works with some keyboards and is totally broken on others.The truth can be any combination of these or maybe something else. Anyways below are some links that I read long ago when I last time played this game. I tried every tip that they contained to fix keyboard handling but they didn't help at all. I had forgotten that some comments in the linked threads claimed that the game actually was playable with keyboard to them, so case C may have some truth in it.http://www.rage3d.com/board/showthread.php?t=33760759http://www.rage3d.com/board/showthread.php?t=33699952Anyways, my thanks for Ƨcotch for commenting this review which allowed me to know the possible reason why this review is getting so much negative votes. If someone else has other explanations, please comment.			",39,0,4,3,9,0,5

												I honestly don't know if I should recommend this game. It really depends of what you prefer.The lack of car customization disappointed me. I really like costumizing my own car, and it's always the special feature to me for racing games. But it doesn't have it because the cars are already modified so you can race the bosses.The game itself is ok. You have to earn the cars on career mode, not only to drive them there, but on the arcade mode. If you're a person who likes challanges, this is a cool thing. But if you want the immidiate thing on arcade mode, this kinda sucks for you.If you have your driving settings for keyboard, the steering is pretty immediate. It's very different if you're used to drifting (you can also drift if you press the spacebar while steering).But that is all there is to it, to me.I own Midnight Club 3 Dub Edition Remix and it's FAR better, there's no comparison. It's KIND OF like Portal and Portal 2. The second is far more developed and has much better quality and gameplay (not to mention the soundtracks on MC3). Except I wouldn't not recomend Portal.So here you go folks, I recommend acquiring this only if it's ever free on sale. I got it on sale for 2,75 and I'm super disapointed.But of course, if you have your own strong reasons, buy it.			",68,5,5,9,3,2,4

												Whoever reccomends this game is whacked.However If you are looking for an dated arcade/coin-operated feeling racer then this game might be for you. Racing in this game consists of getting from one checkpoint to the next... and that's it.Bad things:Had to hold down and right arrow keys to navigate the menu at the start of the game to stop it from scrolling wildly.Music is repetitive/annoying, Raps are weak, stupid and repetitive.(Sounds like they were made by drake)NO customization, A car can be one of four colors (e.g.White, Silver, Black, Blue)Winning is based on knowledge of the racing layout/map instead of actual skill.Difficulty spike after the third race.Nitrous feels more like strapping rockets to your car.Graphics look look like they are from some cheap arcade game.There is a ""Race Editor"" thing but they don't even tell you how to use it.Cool features:The abilty to go under semi-trailersIn-air weight shiftingHaving to dodge helicopter spotlights while racing(But you really don't even have to try.)Burnout(which is a boost at the start of the race but also looks cool)Reactive commentary by the racers(They could of toned it down a little though)Some objects are destructible.Motorbikes which can do some cool tricks.This game was released at the same time as Need for Speed: Underground it has no excuse.Rockstar just got GTA and tried to make a racing game out of it and the only reason why people have this game is because Rockstar was giving it away free a while ago.

												don't buy it, its a very old game, i never played any of the series but if your like me and never played it and bought it in 2016 then don't.  Online multiplayer is broken (not working/disfunctional) , control is very bad and screenshots here is misleading because they are all cinematic screenshots and not the actual game screenshots. i really prefer Blur racing game compared to this one but hey this game is 2003 ! its old so yeah.

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, ""If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately."" Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 3 thousand26four, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very large sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			",69,5,1,10,3,0,0

												Got this one for free during the Rockstar Max Payne 3 promo.Despite the warning on the store page, the game runs just fine right out of the box on Windows 7. Getting a 360 to work with the game, on the other hand, is not so simple -- the game doesn't recognize the triggers on the controller.The game itself is fairly similar to Need For Speed: Underground aesthetically, with Burnout-style open world racing instead of NFS's closed tracks. Looks dated obviously, but does support 1080p widescreen and can run with uncapped framerates, so it runs pretty smoothly at 144Hz.			",277,92,13,45,33,1,65

												""Doesn't work in Windows Vista or 7"" my ♥♥♥. The bug has since been fixed, and yet they're still reporting this falsely (A fix is even Google-able, something that a smart person would do much akin to the sound bugs in Max Payne.) *Ahem* I had played this a long, long time ago on my PS2, borrowed from a good friend of mine in high school. It was the best racing game I had ever played; not even Midnight Club 3 came close to the fun I had with this one. Play it if you love racing, or play it if you just like outdriving the competition. The campaign was the most enjoyable part of the whole thing. A controller is recommended but a keyboard is fine too.			",479,162,4,58,14,1,32

												This was a classic racing game that I played on the good ol PLaystation 2 back when it first came out. I enjoyed it then and I'm happy to see it on Steam. Start out with racing local street racers and win your way up to the main opponents and become the greatest racer. Oh and when and if you get this game, here's a tip: USE A GAMING PAD (for me I use an XBox 360 controller). Playing on the keyboard makes the steering very toughy and jerky, making for not-so smooth turns. And here's a free gift to you:Cheat Code:rimbuk - unlocks ALL cars and cities in ARCADE MODE ONLY. Also with this cheat activated, the horn button fires a bazooka and the button that flashes your lights fires a machine gun			",20,4,3,5,7,1,2

												Really fun if you like street racing games or a good challenge as this game can provide both. For a game released in 2003 it still stands pretty well today and even has a whole modding communtiy to back it up to keep the game interesting. I find this game to be really replayable as I keep coming back to play the through the game over and over again. Although it may be somewhat short, I find it just adds to the replayability of the game. The racing itself gets pretty fast paced when you get out of the first hub world with features like the burnout, nitrous and wheelies (for bikes) to keep you getting back up to speed pretty quickly. The open-world combined with open checkpoint style races allow for the player to go their own route through the races (or at least to the next checkpoint) or just follow the AI. Because of this, however, most races might require multiple tries to be able to learn the race beforehand and know where you're actually going and to take the optimal route to win. Trying to do these for the first time can sometime prove difficult as the races get longer and checkpoints are spread further out, which is where some of the difficulty comes in. Also that you have to use your current vehicle to beat people who are using vehicles of (most of the time) better performance. This isn't necessarily a complaint from me as the feeling from finally finishing first after many tries is amazing, knowing you can finally move on through the career. My only complaint is the bloody traffic; the most annoying/frustrating part about this game. I don't know if I just have really bad luck or something but it seems everytime a traffic car 'swerves' out of the way it always ends up swerving right into me as I see everyone pass me in that instant. Also when random long busses like to go across intersections right when you happen to be crossing perpendicular to them. But besides that, I absolutely love this game.*ProbablyJustANostalgiaFanaticReview*			",22,6,6,0,4,0,0
