												I do not recommend this game for anyone over the age of 8. There is little to no challenge even on the highest difficulty, the voices are dreadfully squeaky and annoying and the music is barely tolerable.

												This is an evolution of the human race. Only in my dreams have I witnessed slimy gumballs sloshing around in different gamemodes! Don't even get me started on the only server! It's the best server you can imagine, based in the czech republic. If I went on this review would be at least 4 pages long. BUY THIS NOW!!!UPDATE: The game really is just a mediocre flash game that you have to pay for. Has frame rate drops, buy this for your friend, not yourself. You're not missing anything. Pros:Kinda fun at timesCons:Too easyBroken Multiplayer (I started my own server and couldn't even join)Framerate dropsJust noUPDATE # DOS: I recently made a steam group for this game, join if you want!!

												Probably the worst game I've bought. I was glad to have gotten it for only $0.50 on sale. Right now I can run crysis 2 on high with DX11 on at full fps but this game lags like a benchmark running on a potato. I'm not the only person to complain about this. Perhaps if you fix it, it might be worth your time.			",256,37,10,25,17,3,29

												Gumboy Tournament is a inexpensive game to seep your time into for a few minutes each day or if you've nothing else to do/play. In this game, you are a racing gumball(I know, right?) and you go through many levels and different kinds of races(which are basically just the same 9-10 levels repeated over and over again, slowly becoming more challenging) to earn trophies. Basically, you use your mouse to move and fire your gumball in different directions. The AI is pathetic, so most all of the races are easy, and you'll beat each in roughly 1-3, depending on how far you are. The graphics are livable, but they're not that great and make the game look flat. The game does have multiplayer, although I have not personally tried it out since no one has made a server in a good few years, but I imagine that it would have the same gameplay as the singleplayer.In short, this is a relatively fun, casual game to spend your free time on when you've only got a minute or so and you've run out of dragons to kill. The multiplayer however has been dead for several years now though, so only play for singleplayer or with friends. $3 is too expensive for this game, seeing as of how you can easily buy this game on sale for $.29. Rating: 6/10: the game is fun for the price I paid, but is mostly uninspired.			",72,5,1,7,5,0,21

												Being trained as a professional Flying Fox at the ""Military University of Foxes and Kitsunes"" and having 150 confirmed potion victims i can honestly say that this game is one hell of a game.It is hard, even for me, to roll that constant through the world like those marble like creatures. Trust me, that actually was part of our basic training, they are just too pro for me.Although it is offered at steam our Scientist team lead by very talented Doges (it is hard to find good quality Fox personal nowadays) has found out that you can actually get the 1.8 release of  Gumboy at CNET download legaly FOR FREE.(source: Gumboytournament.com)It is said that their Headquarter is in the Szech Republic and that their only connection to the glorious Fox connection (and no, we do not own Fox TV) does not work for anybody and that the named server probably is almost down. But thanks for everything there is a Campset orderable for free to set up your own Military Base (server).The commentator of the Game is none other than the famous superstar Squeeky Mc Squeek, also known for one of the voice actors from the Chipmunks Series and many many other quality internet videos.Rumours say, that you can gather the all mighty power of his voice by inhaling Helium. And no: That is not how we Foxes sound.One of our researchers has also made a small visit to the culture of the GumboysIt appears that they like to race against each other who gets the fasted amount of Diamonds and can sell those for 50,100 and 200 Fox$ers to our intergalactic Organisation.When they  shall not do so, they try to steal the Flagg of their other Nation and bring it to their own Flag.Apparently they do not like each other and have always to show which is the best Nation.The Gumboys got named one of the most fabulous Creatures 2006 by the russian dancing men organisation ""Gametunnel"".We blame the capitalist pig!

												Gumboy Tournament is the multiplayer version of Gumboy: Crazy Adventures. You're a gumboy, which is basically a ball that can stick to surfaces, also the gumboy is able to jump.Your goal in the game is to collect more diamonds than your opponent does. You can play vs bots, local vs a friend or online. Mind you though, there probably won't be any player online to play.Gumboy Tournament is a neat party game, especially for kids but you probably get bored with it pretty quickly. The game is cheap (normal price: 2 bucks, in a steam deal it could be 0,30 cents) which is the right price for the game but in my opinion it's not enough to recommend this game.

Product received for free
												So I have a tale to tell about my experience procuring Gumboy Tournament.It was a warm summer night, and I was walking to my local Toys R Us to check out the games . I hoped to find some hidden gems, but what I found was like discovering a brand new Ninjustu (I'm a ninja of the Hidden Leaf Village). As I enter the store, and quickly concentrate my chakra to my feet to zoom across the aisles to the game section, and see a new game ""Gumboy Tournament"" sitting on the shelf. There is only one copy left, and I see some granny about to take it, talking about how her grandson would like it. I swiftly throw my kunai at her, and then dash up and chop her in 2 with my katana. At last, this game will be my sweet salvation. I take it to the cash register, and hastily give the cashier (who happened to be a pretty female around my age) the game. She attempts to scan it, when all of a sudden, an army of grannies start charging at us as fast as the can, their walkers squeaking across the floor, as they try to get the game for their grand kids. I start doing my tiger hand signs, preparing my self for the Fireball jutsu. As I build up my chakra, I say "" I  will not let you assault m'lady in this manner ."" I cast my fireball jutsu, and burn all the vermin (to the unknowing eye, it would look like I just took out a lighter and a can of Axe™ spray, but this is just what non-believers see). I turn back to the cashier, and she gives me the now purchased game. She looks at me longingly and says ""Wanna go on a date soon?"" I look back at her, tip my fedora, and reply ""No thanks, m'lady, you aren't my type.""OVERALL REVIEW: It was alright...			",92,10,1,15,13,1,3

												Holy mother, this game is absolutely pointless and pathetic. The conrols are irritating, the music and voices are annoying, and you can beat it in less than half an hour. I only bought it because it was sale for 29 cents, and its not even worth that. Even if you think that you can ""appreciate"" an indie puzzle game like this one, you definitely should not buy this unless it's for a younger sibling or as a joke gift to a friend.

												Lame. You play as a sticky ball that rolls along the edge of things and tries to beat other sticky balls to the objectives. It sounds lame because it is. It has local co-op, which I didn't try, but I'm sure that would still be lame. But do check out the video for this game in its Community Hub, which is hilarious.			",808,284,34,136,92,14,202
