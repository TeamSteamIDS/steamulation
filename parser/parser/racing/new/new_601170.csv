												82 Minutes into the game so far, and I have to say that while I'm enjoying the game, the AI is incredibly slow. Once you get out in front, there's no chance of the AI catching up. They definitely need to be more aggressive. It took me all of one race to get used to the way that the truck handled, with the back end swinging out to drift around corners. I'll admit that I hit a few walls in the process, but it was fairly easy to recover.I think there's a heck of a lot of potential in this game. I just hope the devs are willing to put the time into it!Edit: Also, on one race, one of the AI trucks flipped over and didn't recover. it stayed in the middle of the track for the remainder of the race with it's engine revving. Maybe some AI recovery would be an idea to implement so they can get back into the race?			",23,5,12,3,9,0,1

												So far i have played the game for just under 2 hours , it has potential to be a great truck rallycross game and the devs are i believe going to add more content and updates with the help of feedback for the game from the steam community.The few tracks i have raced on at the moment could be better i felt they where a bit boring need some big jumps :-)Also the A.I seemed a bit slow at times.Looking forward to see how the game now develops and what updates the devs do.Its a great arcade truck rallycross game lets see if the devs place more time in the game to help reach its full potential. See some gameplay below

												This is a totally unfinished and broken game. Do not buy this game, it's not worth any amount of money!			",51,7,7,4,9,1,1

												Game is in Early Access/beta state, but it is not marked so, so let's pretend it is in final state. Trucks are nice with almost actual graphics but without damage model, tracks are boring with 10 years old graphics, competitors are completely useless (they are not racing at all!), you can upgrade your truck multiple times with the same upgrade package and so on, and so on.Wait for later patches if there will be any. The game in current state is not worth even this low price tag. I am sorry.			",559,101,126,133,93,3,159

												Game looks good at start with minor issues till you try to drive. With joystick or keyboard I was unable to drive forward or anything. What a disapointment as I was looking forward to trying this. ;-(			",89,26,4,4,18,1,5
