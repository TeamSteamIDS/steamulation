												This game looks good and has good sfx and soundtrack but lack of actual gameplay. Just 3 different forms of obstacle racing. Also easily causes vr motion sickness.			",61,9,0,5,6,1,4

												This is a review for gameplay on the HTC Vive:Wonderful.  Vertigo inducing in a good way (the way I imagine you'd feel flying around on the back of a dragon).  If flight simulators don't give you motion sickness you will be fine, but if you are sensitive to rolling and pitching, then you might have issues.  I feel fine, and my daughter did as well.The ambient graphics are good, and I love looking back while in flight to see the sun on the dragon's wings.The controls are not obvious, but once you get them down, the levels become very difficult, but obtainable.The primary reason for buying this game though is not the levels, but just the amazing feeling of being on the back of a dragon.  God I love VR ;)			",139,40,10,6,41,4,4

												There's potential here. The core feel of riding a dragon is pretty good.However, this game needs instructions, extra content, polish, and some way to combat motion sickness before I can say it's worth the full ten dollar asking price.I think this would have been much better suited to early access, since it's essentially a proof of concept...EDIT: You guys gonna update your game, or what?
