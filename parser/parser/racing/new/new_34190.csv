THIS VERSION OR TRANSFORMED-VERSION: WHICH TO BUY?Firstly, let me say if you are only interested in a SINGLE-PLAYER experience, then get this game and rather than TRANSFORMED.  This game is arguably superior in at least one aspect: it has context-sensitive race announcer!  If you are torn between THIS VERSION or TRANSFORMED, start with this one--it's a great game and you will not be disappointed.  I have played Transformed on two other platforms so I can stand by this review.  That being said, if you want multiplayer, get Transformed.FULL REVIEWSonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing is a brilliant kart racer and nearly as good as any MARIO KART racer.  It's the only Kart Racer that I keep coming back to (e.g., I have purchased this game on three different platforms).  This game is bug-free (as of 11-1-2014) and runs beautifully on my gaming laptop.  Pros+ Creative, fun, and colorful course designs (the underwater ancient ruins is a particular fav of mine)+ Addictive and catchy music+ Stellar character models and animation+ Unique and varied voice acting+ Infinite replayability and variety+ Seamless controller support+ Several difficulty settings to maintain challenge over-time+ Local multiplayerCons- No online multiplayer supportIf you are  a fan of Kart Racers, than this game is a must-buy!Please hit the like button if you found this review at all helpful.  Thanks :D			",145,86,9,17,24,0,10

												Can't decide if you want this game, or Transformed? I'll make it easy. Buy them both. Wait till they're on sale and get them both. Why? Because both this and Transformed are excellent games.Ok, so now that we got that outa the way, here's why I recommend this game. I actually started off playing Transformed first when I first got into PC gaming. I absolutely love Transformed which is why I was kinda scared to buy this installment. I had looked up video footage and it didn't appear to be worth my while. Well I had some extra Steam money and had nothing else to spend it on so I finally just bought this game. As many have complained about there is no online multiplayer. Boo hoo......I don't care. I buy games for their single player experiences. What I've always liked about Transformed is that it is a REAL racing game, unlike Mario Kart which feels like dodge ball on wheels. Sonic and Sega All Star Racing is no exception. Even though it is not as fast as Transformed, it is still a balls to the wall racing game. The A.I. DOES NOT rubberband on you like Mario Kart does and the weapons slow you down, but not so bad that your chances of winning are ruined by a few unlucky hits. If I had one complaint about the game, it would be the weapons. They're kinda boring (like Mario Kart) but that's to be expected because this was Sega's first crack at a kart racer. However to me the racing is important, and the drift and stunt boosting are still here though it's not as elaborate as Tranformed is. I love the tranforming dynamic in Transformed, but I don't miss it in this game. What I'm trying to say is that this is an excellent kart racer than stands on it's own and I still like it 10 times better than any recent release of Mario Kart. It still does everything right, and the best reason buying this game as well as Transformed is that all of the tracks are different from the second installment. I bought this game because I wanted more Sonic All Star Racing after I completed Transformed.Lastly this game is not coded as well as Transformed is so don't be surprised if the game drops a few frames here and there. You won't see the drops in your frame rate counter, but you'll notice the slight stutters. They are not even close to game breaking, but just know that there's nothing wrong with your computer.

												While Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed has a lot to offer, I felt that this instalment had a little more.  It seemed like there were more tracks than in Transformed, which wasted tons of space by making mirror versions of the already existing ones.  And because this earlier version had more tracks, you'd get different looks at more than one SEGA franchise, instead of Transformed having only one track for every series except Sonic The Hedgehog.  I also preferred the active announcer in this title over the one in Transformed.  This one actively says what's going on in the race, and does it with excitement and gusto, whereas the one in Transformed just uninterestingly states short phrases, item names, and achievements.  Sure, the graphics and the racing itself may be better in Transformed, but I think its predecessor did a better job at the content and the experience as a whole.			",87,4,3,7,3,2,4

												If there is one thing that I really like about this game is how easy it is to pick up and play the game without having a prior knowledge of how racing kart games work. You get lots of characters in game and different tracks and racers that you can earn when you do better in the game. I'm surprised that in this game, the House of the Dead Curien Mansion made it as a playable track. As you may know House of the Dead is a mature rated game :) The controls are great and the fun factor is in there. I believe they even came out with this game in the arcade as well. While we know a famous plumber won't make their PC gaming debut anytime soon it's a safe bet that this is the best racer on the PC hands down if your looking for a fun arcade style racer to play. You won't be dissapointed and the fun factor will be there. Be sure to get it on a sale if you can because websites that are authorized to sell Steam games discount it often.

												A lot better than some people would give it credit for, and a pleasant change from all the driving simulations out there at the moment. If you don't know already this game was the start of something bigger... in the form of Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed. Currently both games are also included in the Sonic Hits Collection for €27,99.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game can be seen as Sega's Mario Kart and it is to a certain extent. However, It does seem to have it's own style in the choice of characters and power-ups like the All-Star. If you like Mario Kart, take this game for a ride (pun intended) too.			",418,71,12,36,20,3,48

												A very under-rated Sonic game! It has some things that it lacks from Transformed, like Online MP and obviously transformations, but I think this game is still worth picking up! I just think things like the music is better here. You can buy multiple music tracks for one racing track which is great.Worth picking up if it's like 5€ or something. It has pretty good singleplayer, but if you are mainly going to play multiplayer, then transformed is going to be better for you.			",772,146,31,93,83,11,95

Cheap as dirtIf you like Transformed, I also recommend this for the added stages and characters.It seems to run on the same engine with only minor differences in gameplay. Characters don't level and only have one cart each, and you have to watch for cues as to what drift level you're on. Other than that, it's -by and large- the same.			",386,74,8,49,22,3,43

												I have to say this game is pretty awesome for many reasons. It combines all the SEGA games together into one game where your favourite characters race against each other! A huge number of tracks from different worlds with cool environments. Also , This game has enough game modes to keep you playing for a long time! I'd recommend this game to people who have played games from the SEGA company back then to bring all your memories/favourite characters into one action racing game! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sonic SEGA All-Stars Racing is a pretty good 'Mario Kart clone' and it probably would be the best kart game on Steam if not for Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, which is better and way more fun but comes at a higher price.Since this game does not come with multiplayer support this game is only recommended for players who just feel like playing a game like this single player.

												Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing is a wierd one. At the time I didn't have enough cash for transformed so i got this instead. To start with I was extremely impressed. I played a couple of missions, looked at the character roster and tracks. It seemed great, and it was until I came across an almost game-breaking glitch. Warning, if you have intel hd graphics. When using my intel graphics card, I noticed something very strange. There are a select few stages that don't start and crash the game, and  since the first stage in the chao cup is unplayable due to this glitch, the entire grand prix is unplayable. I believe you can fix this problem by verifying the game cache or doing some stuff in the graphics settings, but Sega really shouldn't have made people have to do this. I enjoyed the game without my intel graphics card, but due to these problems, this could easily be written off as a crappy port. Sega has done this a few too many times now and it's beginning to get annoying. So if you don't have intel, i fully recommend, but if you do, there will be some settings involved to get the game to work.			",253,19,6,22,15,0,25

												A surprisingly great racing game featuring Sega characters.When I first saw this game, I thought it was Sega's poor attempt at a Mario Kart rip-off. Boy, was I wrong! This game is a blast to play! The visuals are nice, the soundtrack is fantastic, the selection of characters is good, and the tracks are well designed.GraphicsThis game debuted sometime in 2010. Even so, with its crisp HD textures, soft particles, motion blur, shadows, and good models, the visuals hold up even to today's standards. No complaints here.AudioThe sound effects are nothing special, but get the job done. Where the audio really shines is in its soundtracks. Man, they are fantastic! Most (if not all) of them are ripped or remixed from past Sega games, but they all sound great. I like listening to the Billy Hatcher soundtracks, and I especially love the Samba de Amigo tracks!CharactersThere's the Sonic staples: Sonic, Amy, Knuckles, Tails, Eggman, and Big, but there's also Billy Hatcher, Aiai, Jet Set Radio people, and more. Sega did an outstanding job at really offering a diversified ensemble of characters to choose from.TracksJust like with the characters, the race tracks include vistas from Sonic, Billy Hatcher, Jet Set Radio, Samba de Amigo, and more. Being a big Billy Hatcher fan myself, I was overjoyed to be able to race through Dino Mountain and Blizzard Castle (I'm still waiting for a Billy Hatcher sequel, Sega!).KartsThe kart selection, compared to games like Mario Kart, is underwhelming. You do not win or unlock new vehicles (though you do win/unlock an in-game currency and new stages); you have only one vehicle per character. This is not bad, as each character has a vehicle that handles differently from the last, but it would still have been nice to select from different kart variants. Oh well.PerformanceFor a game that debuted so many years ago, it is surprising just how poorly optimized it is. At times I encountered random stuttering and frame drops. It plays almost as smooth as butter on low settings, but hiccups here and there on anything else.VerdictThis is an outstanding racing game that offers crisp visuals, a fantastic sound track, a great selection of characters and tracks, and includes wonderful gamepad support and smooth controls. There is an overwhelming amount of replay value here, what with grand prix, missions, multiplayer, single races, challenges, and more. Perhaps the only negative is the lack of wireless multiplayer (it's local only). It would have been a blast to race with others around the world! Final thoughts: this is a great racing game.

While the gameplay isn't very deep, the amount of content this game provides more than worth the price.

												EDIT - Allright. Gotta be fair. So long as you set your speakers in Control Panel to stereo ONLY (NOT quad or 5.1), the game runs. You will get past the splash screen. Now that the game does run OK, I gotta say it's a blast to play. Every blue moon or so there is a bit of slowdown but it doesn't last long and mostly the game runs well and fast, even at 1920x1200. There are a ton of tracks and racers and if you want some old-school carting fun, this game fills the bill. I haven't tried Transformed yet but this one is a blast, especially if you can get it on sale for about $3. It isn't hard to do well but that doesn't detract from the fun. It makes me smile so that's OK in my book.			",237,189,34,6,13,4,27

												It's great, BUT... Well, if you have an Xbox360, get that version instead of the PC version. It has two more playable racers and actual online play. If not, but you have a PS3, get that version instead of the PC version, it at least has online play.In general, is easily the best kart-style racing game around on a non-Nintendo system, it's really good... But the PC version has two major faults. While it runs ok, it's a half-♥♥♥♥♥ port in most other respects. Still shows keyboard keys when using a gamepad, you can't actually type where it asks for text input.Second, Sega actually stated that PC games would just pirate the game anyway, and used that as an excuse to remove all online features including online multiplayer and any access to the DLC content (no, it makes no sense to me either)... so you're getting a lot less game on PC than on Console.

												When Sonic racing games started getting good! Sonic R and Sonic Drift were just terrible! The Sonic Riders series was a step in the right direction, but didn't sell to well. Then you have this, Sonic and & SEGA All-Stars Racing. Lemme just say, the fact they had to put Sonic in the title makes me feel like SEGA was trying to money ♥♥♥♥♥ this game. I get that Sonic is popular and all but c'mon now. Anyway let's move on.I really do recommend this game, but sadly not for the PC.What is wrong with the PC version:-No Controller Support-No Online Play-Split Screen only-Somewhat poor optimizationI know SEGA isn't known for making good PC ports, but sheesh this is pretty bad! Now, I'm not saying the keyboard controls are bad on this game infact they're pretty easy to use. Most racing games, however are MUCH EASIER with a controller! I know. I know. There are ways to use a controller on certain PC games, but for me it's kinda a bad thing. I may just be stupid and can't find the option for a controller, but I doubt there is one. If you are wondering, the sequel Sonic and & All-Stars Racing Transformed DOES have controller support which a good thing.I also know what your thinking: How can you trust me with this Review if I barley played the game?Simple answer: I've played the hell out of this game on the consoles!The Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and even the Wii got online features and exclusive characters! (PS3 didn't get any exclusive characters.) The Xbox 360 version got Banjo & Kazooie and the Wii got the Mii Characters! The PC version (and the PS3 version) didn't get any kind of cool characters which is pretty disappointing.I really do recommend this game, but I think it was a lot better back when I played it on my Xbox 360. If you can't get it on your console, the PC version is still ok. The game is a great game overall though!It has memorable race tracks from different SEGA games, almost all the SEGA characters you know and love are playable characters (except Nights and a few others), kickass soundtrack, great gameplay, fun modes, fun challenges, great multiplayer, and many more!

												Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing is a combat 'cart' style racer that has you racing as Sonic, his friends and plenty of others from Sega's franchises. There are 24 tracks to race around in 5 grand prix of 4 races each. On top of that there is a mission mode that has a variety of 64 challenges. There is NO ONLINE MULTIPLAYER, but there is split screen multiplayer The game is fun, but it feels inferior yet similar to the follow up, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed. On top of that, a lot of the tracks are wide and vacant with no sort of precision needed to navigate them. Each track is inspired by what feel like six games. Sonic, Samba de Amigo, Jet Set Radio, Billy Hatcher, House of the Dead, and Super Monkey Ball. Out of 24 tracks, there aren't that many memorable ones. Mostly because every track is just feels like a road. Most tracks have jumps, some have giant loops and the Super Monkey Ball tracks have plenty of 90 degree turns.The gameplay is simple, you steer your vehicle and pull a trigger to accelerate. When you go into turns, you can drift by holding the other trigger and navigating your way through. If you drift long enough, you'll get a boost coming out of the drift. The longer you hold the drift, the bigger the boost. Its a great, easy to use system, but the tracks are always so wide that you can drift in a straight away to get boosts. There are purple arrows that will automatically boost you, but they're pretty rare. If that wasn't enough, you can pull the drift trigger when flying through the air to do a trick and get a boost when you land. Other than for a boost, there's no practical use for tricks. Each trick feels like it takes too long to be effective. Plus, with all of the drift boosts, the trick boosts are overshadowed.Like all combat games, you'll drive through weapon jars that will give you a random weapon from a wide variety. There is a boxing glove that stuns an enemy. A homing missile that locks onto whomever you target. A simple bubble shield to protect you. Giant rolling bombs that explode and do a radius effect. A star that you can lock onto an enemy and their view will be upside-down. Traffic cones that you can put down as obstacles. Standard boosts and many more items. Even after 4 hours of playing, I still have no idea what some of the weapons do. There is even an All-Star that is specific to each character. It is a good way to get to the head of the pack while decimating other drivers along the way.The combat doesn't feel like it wins most races. Skilled players will always find themselves at the front. Although tougher courses with hairpin turns can be balanced by weapons. Very rarely will a last place player get an item that brings them to the front of the pack.The game has several drivers, mostly from Sonic games and Dreamcast games, each with their own stats. To balance the drivers, they all have an equal total of stat points. The stars are put into speed, acceleration, handling and turbo-boost. You'll need to put strategies into each driver accordingly. Dr. Eggman has maximum boost and speed, but little handling and acceleration, so you really need to drift to get your boost or you'll be last in line.  Each driver has their own vehicle. Some drive cars, and others like Alex Kidd and Shadow drive motorcycles. Dr. Eggman drives a monster trucks and so on. Tails drive a plane. He doesn't fly it, he drives it. That feels like a let down, but Tails has always had a plane. Every mission and Grand Prix that you complete gets you these 'miles' which you use to unlock new drivers. After unlocking all the drivers, you can unlock the tracks for time trials even though they're already in the grand prix.The 64 missions are very quick, but fun to play. Most of them are around a minute. The game assigns you a driver. It offers a nice variety. Things like collecting rings, or killing enemies to boss battles against other drivers and straight up races. As you do each mission, you are graded. If you get an A grade at the end and accomplish the mission, you'll unlock the next mission or so. Its a nice system. I'm happy the developer put in the missions, but each mission feels quick. In fact the tracks themselves feel quick, short and small. Each lap is about a minute, which is the right amount of time to not get bored of a track before its over. The follow up Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed featured tracks that would drastically change between laps. This game doesn't. Its the same three laps. While that might be the status quo for every racing game, they could have done more.Frame rate drops seemed to be quiet common in each race. Nothing game breaking, just a few times each race. Even when I lowered graphics settings and my PC is well over the recommended PC specifications. Yet with Racing Transformed, I don't have these problems. It is odd, but I'll chalk it up to this game being 3 years older than the other.Another low point is the announcer. He's quite predominant and eventually I grew tired of him 5 hours in. He's always there. Not to mention the music. There needed to be more variety for me. Each track should have its own theme. Some of the music got old fast. A lot of the tracks also shared the same environmental feel to them. They weren't the same layout, but the same environment, like three tracks in a casino. I suppose 3 tracks of the same theme is forgivable when there are 24 tracks. I'd rather have more tracks with less environments than less tracks.In all, its a fun game. However, I simply can't recommend it compared to the later version. Yet I can always tell people go buy Sonic 1, 2 & 3. Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing is a great starting point for any combat racer, yet the follow up is just so much better. Dynamically changing levels, you pilot boats and fly planes instead of simply racing land vehicles. If you only have $10 and will never ever be able to get the $20 needed to buy Sonic & All-Stars Racing, then please buy this game. It fills a car combat niche that Steam is sorely lacking.

												There's something about pre-2012 SEGA PC ports that bugs the hell out of me, and I can't quite put my finger on it. Either way, Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing is a somewhat decent port of a really good arcade racer. It has native gamepad support which is becoming more common these days, and is better played this way. The tracks in this game are designed well, and are considerably easier to chew on than those longer tracks found in Transformed. It may take a little getting used to the Outrun 2 based drifting, but once you get the hang of it, you'll have a decent kart racer with familiar faces in your hands.			",242,41,14,33,16,4,22

												It's not a bad game but the PC version has to be the worst port of the game because of lack of DLC, and online play.

CHECK, cool soundtrack (especially the Jet Set Radio ones) ? CHECK, Realism ? NO WAY ! Somewhere between Need for speed and trackmania with cartoon graphics and weapons is where I'd place this game. Plenty of playability thanks to the 64 missions in the mission mode, but also the kind of game you can pick up play for a few minutes and then put down again, or alternatively it's also perfect for spending a few hours with.

												It's like Sega's version of Mario Kart.There's quite a lot of races and missions to get through and many unlockables but the racing gets a bit repetitive.Controls are mostly ok.  I found the drifting mechanic awkward to use - you basically hold a button to drift yet you can still continue in almost a straight line.  Drift is used to charge up boosts so you end up drifting most of the way around a circuit even sometimes on relatively straight sections.Visuals and audio are great, with good Sega music including classics from older games and colourful, very varied and well animated playable characters.As far as arcade racing goes, this fits the stereotype perfectly - there's even a commentator announcing what's happening as you race.  So if arcade racing is your thing (which Sega have a history in), give this a go.			",1161,450,68,160,175,13,271

												This is an unfortunately sloppy port of what is normally a good game. When I originally tried to play this game, I... well, couldn't. Despite greatly exceeding the minimum system requirements needed to run the game, every single race was plagued by massive stuttering. Sometimes I would wonder if the game itself had frozen, because it would suddenly stop for more than a full second in the middle of race for no reason whatsoever. It made the game totally unplayable on every single level, and there was nothing I could do to fix it. Reading up online, I was not alone in having this issue, and the game's developers apparently made a statement that it was a ""shader caching"" bug effecting certain graphics cards (primarily the AMD Radeon brand) and it was somehow impossible to fix.A couple months ago, I rebuilt my entire PC, and a friend provided me with a hand-me-down graphics card that, when it debuted in 2012, originally cost $450. Not exactly top-brass in 2016, but more than capable to get the job done. It's also an AMD Radeon card, but for whatever reason, the stuttering bug I originally experienced when I first bought the game was not present on my brand new, rebuilt system. Instead, I was greeted with errors rendering environment shadows, missing effects, flickering particles, and occasionally corrupted textures. The game runs fine otherwise -- a solid, unflinching 60fps. But the rest of the visual presentation leaves a little bit to be desired.If you are one of the lucky few who can run this game properly, good for you. Unfortunately, across two completely different computers, I've never been able to get it to look and play quite right. It's also missing online multiplayer and, just like the console versions, sometimes you can't execute tricks when jumping off of ramps for arbitrary reasons.I loved this game on my Xbox 360, but this port is a straight up mess. You might get lucky with it, but buy it at your own risk. Otherwise, I'd suggest you play its sequel instead (Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed).			",443,83,23,36,20,4,52

												While it's not as good as it's Transforming Sibling, it's still a very good Kart Racing Game & deserves just as much attention.  I just wish that the PC version didn't suffer from severe FPS stutter & slowdown that makes it nearly unplayable.PROS-Wide Variety of Content-Up to 4-Player Split Screen-Full Controller Support (X-Input)-Lots of UnlockablesCONS-No Online Support-Too Much Motion Blur (Can be turned off)-FPS Stutters & FreezesContentThe game has a variety of features & has a very good amount of content for it's purchase price.  The Single Player has the standard Grand Prix, Time Trials, & Challenges that will cater to a wide variety of difficulties.  I myself like to start out at the bottom ranks & work my way up rather than start out on the highest difficulty right away.  There's also multiplayer split screen for those who have local friends to play with.  If you're looking for an online experience you should probably check out Sega All-Star Racing TRANSFORMED.PERFORMANCE ISSUESThere is a big performance issue I seem to be having on several of my systems.  A big FPS stutter that won't seem to go away.  I've tried the D3D9.dll fix along with several others but none of which seemed to do anything.  It's a real shame cause I wasn't having this problem when I first started playing.  Either that or I just didn't notice it as much as I am currently.  I'm going to try and find more fixes if there are any available.  In the meantime, be wary when buying this game.MULTIPLAYERI have yet to try the multiplayer modes.OVERALLEarly into the game & I think it's easily a recommendable title if you don't experience the problems I seem to be having.  The stutter can get really bad & make the game nigh unplayable.  It's still got everything you'd want in a Kart Racing game & probably a few things extra.  If you're on the fence about buying it you could always wait for a sale like I did but with the severe performance issues you might be better off skipping this one altogether especially since there is a better Sonic Kart Racing game in the newer Transformed.

												Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing is a Mario Kart game with Sega characters. There's nothing wrong with that, but it is very noticable. At the time of its release, it was good (I've never played it, but I've seen reviews) but now its generic, especially with the Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, which overshadows this game by a long shot. Like I said, it's not bad at all, but you might as well get Transformed, or a Mario Kart, if you don't like Sega characters. It was good for the time. And if you really like racing games I would recommend, also if you want more maps in the All-Stars games (Transformed).The items are mostly ripped right from Mario Kart, but maybe act a tiny bit different or just looks different. Here I'll show you below: (Format: Sega racing = Mario Kart)Punching Glove = Green ShellHoming Mistle = Red ShellMine = Banana PeelRainbow = BlooperHorn (actually origional before Mario Kart 8) = Super HornAll-Star = Bullet Bill (Not exactly, but some are)Shoe = MushroomMy rating 6/10, not because it's bad, it's because there are a few better options, but if you want the game, go ahead and buy it. (If a decent price.) One last thing, even though I don't recommend it that much, I still like it.			",60,12,4,4,5,1,3

												Failry-optimized port, however, the removal of literally all online play features leaves a lot to be desired. Also, since the game only recognizes xinput-enabled controllers, local multiplayer is unplayable for me without tedious modifications to my setup. While the lack of online play isn't really excusable, there's no steam achievement integreation either, despite the fact that the game has its own ingame achievements. They might as well have linked these to steam, at least.The game itself is fun and enjoyable, and it definitely fares very well against similar mascot racers such as the Mario Kart series, but this version is just not as good as the console versions due to cut features. I'm kinda glad I got it cheaper on sale to be honest.			",103,19,2,8,5,0,3

												This game is fun, but it feels almost like a demo/mini version of Racing Transformed. Now, I'm not saying that it doesn't have its merits, but after playing just a few minutes you can get the whole point of the game. That's not a bad point, being easy to pick up is something that's a little bit refreshing in the ever-increasing difficulty of being able to just friggin' PLAY a game. So, it gets points for that. One thing I can say about Sonic Team is that I haven't really encountered any bugs in any of the games I've played over the past year (after buying the big fat Sonic bundle that Steam has.) What does this mean? Mostly that they make games that work. I'm not happy to say that this is something a game developer should be applauded for, but it has actually reached that point. So - no major issues, great job, Sega. I mean, this really goes for all Sega games I've played in the past year. Whether Sonic racing is a direct response in competition to the competition's go-kart plumbers ""Lets-a-go'ing"" throughout sluggish tracks (and I love Nintendo, too, mind you) or not, it stands on its own as a very fast and zany enough racing game with a few characters to unlock and some cups to achieve. It's fun, but you can probably finish most of the game (Based off of only about a half hour of playing it, and trust me, this is enough to base a review on for as easy as it is to pick up) within about 10 hours. As a party game it stands much higher because it's so easy to pick up. If you have a buddy with an xbox controller, hook it up, and play the crap out of it - though given the scale of most computer monitors, this could be a bit difficult. For the money, I would get it as part of the Hits Collection, because singularly the game is somewhat pricey for what it is, particularly in comparison to Transformed, but you will get your fun out of it. 6/10 - Better than mediocre, but somewhat dated by the time you play Transformed. Outside of being a really GREAT party game, you won't find a lot of incentive to keep playing it. Does have great ""fanboy"" or ""fangirl"" appeal, though.			",2906,1132,96,353,353,29,474

												So here we go! Sonic and Sega all stars racing (or SSSR for short) is a Mario Kart clone, but actually, funner. Why? BECAUSE THERE ARE NO BLUE SHELLS! HALLELUJAH! But really, this is a fun game! When you start, you can test drive with Sonic and get used to the controls and items. I played Transformed, which was fun, but had issues like having rare items TOO rare, the AI getting to BS levels of hard, and the items not being very SEGA themed. I like this game more because from what I played as of 1/2/2017, those issues aren't there. The controls feel fantastic. Fun fact: Mario was going to be in this game as a Wii exclusive, but was removed because of the Olympic crossovers. Really, why can't we have a real crossover, why Olympics? But this game has flaws still. After all, what game does not have flaws? The character lineup is kinda lame. They have those LEGO like guys from that one genesis game, but no Tojam and Earl. (They were cut). And most insulting to me, Cream is not in this game! WHAT! They have Big the Cat (aka Meme the Cat)! Seriously SEGA! But then again, they have not fixed this issue in transformed, even if transformed has AGES. Nothing a 3rd game can't fix. You can get this game dirt cheap on steam, but some copies of the XBOX360 version have Banjo and Kazooie in the game, and labeled, so take a pick!			",37,1,5,2,2,1,7

												Now, I like this game quite a lot. As far as kart racers go, it's quite exceptional, and for me it outdoes Mario Kart in a few key areas, but......Oooo-WOW, this port is bad.I seriously cannot grasp how Sega left it in the state it is in for as long as they have. I figured that once I upgraded from my old Pentium 4, the absolutely ATROCIOUS stuttering would stop or at least be lessened, but NOPE. Here I have a custom built rig that can handle the game's graphically superior sequel, Sonic and All Stars Racing: Transformed, without a single hitch, and yet here whenever I try to run this game it stops, literally, STOPS for a full SECOND whenever a racer gets hit with a powerup, for example. It doesn't seem to run all that well whenever a lot of racers are onscreen at once, either.Bottom line is, DO NOT BUY THIS PORT. If you have some other console the game was released on, buy that version instead. Even the Wii version is a better choice than this, as graphically inferior though it may be, and even if it does run at 30fps or below, it's still at least decently playable in comparison.

												I actually struggled trying to make this game work until recently. It somewhat works except I still have a couple of issues with it. Unless I was able to run it via windowed mode, the game would cause my graphics card to stop responding and recover twice until it refused while playing on fullscreen. I was able to run through most stages fine but for some reason, turbine loop managed to freeze my display everytime to the point where I had to open task manager and close it before it gave me a blue error screen. Unless your PC is running on Windows 8 or 8.1 and you have decent specs, you would get through it fine. But if you updated from 8 to 10, its likely you would not be able to run through the game perfectly without having any issues with your graphics card.Update: Changed .NET to manual and it works fine.

												Now that Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is out, you have no reason to purchase this game. It's a decent kart game, but the levels are repetitive and the game lacks any kind of polish. Transformed actually runs better on most set ups than this. Do yourself a favor and get the sequel.

												I love this game... on the PS3. The PC version is awful, here's why. First before I bought the game I had a VAC Ban. I never played the game but I didn't know what that meant, it said something like I can't play online which I don't care that much. But, I played it and it crashed before every race and I can run Sonic Generations at 30fps with almost no problems and I can't run this racing game. Since I have a VAC ban I can't get a refund, It's only $2.49 right now but still.			",11,0,0,1,1,0,0

												I immediately regret buying this game for $10.My wife and I have put over 60 hours into the sequel, All-Star Racing Transformed. And even though the sequel has glitches, this game... everything is just terrible and generic. The announcer's voice is something out of America's Funniest Home Videos and yet less interesting. The controls are kludgey. The experience system is poor compared to the sequel. Everything feels fuzzy and hard to see... like you're playing it on a Dreamcast over composite video on a piece of junk television from the 80's.After playing the sequel first and just ""wishing for more levels"" I thought this would at least be close. No... apparently they got really good with that sequel because this version sucks.And they get absolutely zero respect from me for automatically crashing on launch if your audio driver is set to anything above 48 KHz. (Welcome to the future.)I am so glad I tried the sequel first. If I had tried this one first, I would have been so disappointed I never would have given the sequel a chance. Buy that one. Buy it now.			",282,100,8,28,36,4,42

												It's Sonic Kart. Like Mario Kart, only the items are useless and unintuitive, and it doesn't even feel fast and thrilling at all. So where's the appeal in this game? Racing games are either about the items or speed, and this has neither, even as Sonic. Also, I love how the XBox360 Windows controller constantly disconnects from it for no reason even with a brand new USB hub attached.			",1,1,2,0,1,0,0

												I cannot recommend this game enough!  I find it a really fantastic kart racing game, and it's good to have a quality title in this genre for the PC.The graphics are really nice and perform very well!  I often play it on my budget Intel Core i5 notebook with nVidia 635m graphics in 1080p on my television.  Levels are interesting and fun to race and just look at.Perhaps overlooked, but one of the best features is the announcer.  The voice actor sounds very authentic like a real sports guy, and while family safe his comments are pretty humorous!  I can't believe they didn't use him again in the follow up Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed!I wish they had more of the more mature rated Sega characters in here from my 80s childhood.  I would have loved to see the Shinobi, Altered Beast, and Golden Axe themed karts!I'm not sure why this game scored lower on Metacritic compared to Mario Kart Wii.  I've logged about 10+ hours playing that on a friends Wii, and I don't see where that game excels over S&SASR.Anyway, I thoroughly enjoy this game and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a soild kart racing game for PC.

												I first played this on the Nintendo Wii and thoroughly enjoyed this game. Personally I'm not much of a racing game kind of person except this game is the exception. Whilst this game is somewhat old it still has that classic charm of being a racing game that doesn't get boring. I purchased this along with some other games in a Sonic Pack on Humble Bundle. Sonic & Sega All Stars Racing combines a great set of music, racing levels and characters. If you're a big Sonic fan than I highly recommend this game as this is an amazingly fun game to play and the controls aren't that complicated to understand. The game brings back a sense of nostalgia and is a great game that up to 8 people can play :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sonic And Sega All-Stars Racing is a racing game that features some of the characters from Sega games. It was developed by Sumo Digital, who also made Outrun 2, and released in 2010. You can also call it kart racing, since it has all those weapons and powerups, but eh. You can. One things for sure: it's drift and boost based. It was also released on other consoles and iOS.As usual, game supports either keyboard or XBox360 controller. It will still show keboard layout no matter what. Also, Steam/PC version is pretty barebones. For some reason, Sega decided that it shouldn't support any online feature. No Steam achievement. There is no Internet multiplayer, only local one. So most of you will be racing only against AI. There are no exclusive characters, like X360 version had Banjo-Kazookie. And there are no DLC, meaning that there is no Metal Sonic or Shenmue hero in forklift.So, what you will get is racing game. Imagine colorful characters of Sonic and heroes of games like Billy Hatcher, AiAi or the ever grinning B. D. Joe. There are around twenty of them, with eight unlocked by default. And then you got the awesome varied tracks, which may have drifty like Casino Park from Sonic, have 90-degree turns and be riddled with obstacles like Monkey Ball tracks, or just be spooky Curien Mansion. Which is censored or alternative name for House of The Dead. Now, pour in weapons and add in drifting mechanic. And then add modes like Grand Prix, Missions, Time Attack. And add in Shopping where you can unlock characters, stages and music tracks for Sega Miles that you get for successfully completing races.Characters vary in venichles that they drive. Outside of the usual stats differences, their vehicles can be sorted into few categories. First, there are usual cars, that can be divided into light and heavy ones. Then you got flying vehicles, like Tails Tornado, that aren't affected by terrain, like snow. And then you will get bikes, which are fast and you can get boost easily by performing ground trick, of pressing up and then down. Seriously, bikes are probably the best, not even sure if it's so balanced. And yes, once again, stats change, vehicles have different acceleration and handling, and, for example, some may stay in air after jump long enough to perform multiple tricks while other are too heavy to stay in air for long.At least, thankfully, all the various tracks will catter to different vehicle types. Some are more straight, some will reward handling. To little geniuses who wonder why Sonic has car: game itself has info in Sonic's profile that he drives a car to give other a sporting chance. The end.And yes, tricks. This game heavily uses drifting mechanics and rewards you for drifting with boost. Drifting is very controllable there, you can take any turns with it or can even try to drift on straight road with some success. Though, you may want to release gas button for sharp turns. You can build up to three level of boost, that will activate after you release the drift button. I recommend you to release it as soon as you see three levels of boost and then drift again immeditly, there are some turns where you can do it twice!You also will be rewarded with boost for doing tricks. First, at the start of race, during countdown, you have to start the gas somewhere between ""3"" and ""2"". Depends on each character. There are air tricks that anybody can do, you just have to press drift button while in air. But make sure to finish air trick before landing, otherwise you will lose all boost that was built up. Bikes, as said, also got ground trick where you just press up and down around.Boosting will also knock obstacles down, like balls, giant casino chips and zzzzzzoooooombies.The game also got power-ups that are randomly chosen when you pick it up. It got a fairly standard package of them. Speeding up, bombs, rockets, rainbow that only colors screen for real players, but hits AI characters. You can also shoot boxing gloves and rockets back. Actually, you can knock off the incoming rockets by using weapon of your own, usually by shooting it back. What kind of powerps you get also depends on what place you are in. As for stopping players that managed to get really far in the first place, it got usual ""screw you"" shooting star. The futher you are in the back, the more likely you will get good ones, getting triple rockets, or nuke rocket that you can detonate any time after launch.Oh, and they got all-star moves. If you are really lacking behind you may get All-Star weapon. Announcer will not be afraid to tell it to everybody either. It's really a jolly power-up, as it will not only boost you to allow you to possibly get into the top, but it gives a character-specific spin. Akira from Virtua Fighter will hit his Outrun-like car with dashing elbow. Alex Kidd will ride on his helicopter, being able to shoot little shiny missiles. And Opa-Opa from Fantasy Zone will even lets you choose one of the three power-ups to use in this case. It shows off a great characters, variety and each one will play a short theme song.You also got around 64 challenges to beat. What should I say, they are varied, changing between more standard ones and more of wacky. In one challenge you have to beat all Jet Set Radio Future tracks. In another you will beat up a huge zombie boss. Jolly.And yes, you can also unlock music tracks. You can then choose to play any one of them in tracks, making it more varied than having same song in all Billy Hatcher tracks. Pretty much all of music is taken from previous games. The only unique ones in the game are main theme ""So much more"" and some other tracks used for menues, that sounds quite what you expect to hear from 90s racing games.And since AI is the only opponent you will most likely get, he should be mentioned. You can disable ""catch-up"" in options, but I would not recommend you to do this. AI just isn't strong enough to figure out how to stop you if you will be far in the lead. It actually manages to drag itself down, as the last players will keep doing All Star move that will hit main pack but will usually fail to reach the top. So, really, let this option be, it doesn't rubberband strong enough to screw you up without reason. you can still stay in the lead, it's just that single mistake will get you back into main pack of racers.Ai isn't that hard either. I was actually surprised that I managed to beat all the Advanced Grand Prix. And I was expecting it to be brutal at it's best. But I guess they tried to kept it fair.AI also playes pretty well, althrough there are some constant thing about it. Some characters are better than others. Some drag behind.For sure, most of the time you will be seeing Shadow The Hedgehog on his bike on top. And you will learn to hate him, as he keeps popping up on top and getting on second place in Grand Prix, where you will even want to pay extra attention to drag him down too, so you will have more breathing air in total scoring. Bonanza Bros also somehow manage to stay on top.And then you got characters like Big and Eggman who keep staying in the last places and spam their All-Stars move. Which will make Eggman, for example, start spamming rockets around, but will fail to reach you. And you will be hearing announcer talking about them alot. Oh. AND AIAI GOT BANANAS, BETTER WATCH OUT!And then you got Amigo, who will somehow be on both sides: Staying on top and getting All-Star move going where he gets on top anyway. At least his conga all-star is fun, making others dance behind.SEGA All-Stars Racing is pretty fun racing. Easy to pick up and play, addictive. One of the best ""kart-racing"", especially on PC where it just doesn't have so much competition. The only shame is that it doesn't support any online features. It also has some exclusive content that you will not get in All-Stars Racing Transformed. At least from what I heard. Tracks are unique for sure.			",759,212,16,82,60,1,131

They made some mistakes in that one like change'n the boost/slide feature for one.  It's kind of like a old school Mario Kart game but with Sonic / Sega characters.

It's simple, but focused, and it does what it sets out to do and does it well.I'd recommend this and it's sequel, Transformed, which is a throwback to Diddy Kong Racing.

												Sega's attempt to capitalize on the popularity of Mario Kart could lead someone to become very cynical towards sonic's take on the racing genre. But this game is suprisingly fun with some great controls. Sega All Stars Racing does nothing innovative but playing as your favorite sonic characters can be charming. All in all the games largest issue is it's limited scope. Many racers have no themed courses and there are so many missed oppurtunities for music tracks.It probably wont hold your interest for a long time, but it has a lot of potential. If you're a massive sega fan you'll be able to find hours of enjoyment completing all the hidden challenges and unlocking the few extras the game offers.			",387,95,9,67,29,5,24

												The best description I can give is that ""it's like Mario Kart, without actually being Mario Kart."" In some ways it is vastly superior to the (IMO stale and repetitive) Mario Kart series, with far more interesting/fun racecourse designs - some of which reflect the games they come from remarkably well - and AI that doesn't cheat like a mother. On the flipside, the power-ups are comparatively bland, and the tracks only feature a handful of aesthetic themes (eight different ""themes"" on 3 tracks each). The character roster contains a lot of obscure figures, many of whom I know nothing about myself. Still though, trying out all the different characters is great fun.It'll give you your kart-racing fix for sure, and is a good stand-in for Mario Kart on the PC. Just watch out for a very rare bug that might abruptly shove you through the floor...			",129,27,4,5,14,3,8

												Purchased to have the original alongside Transformed.Transformed is better in all regards. I expected as much, it being the newer title, but there are some issues I am already having with this one. Issues I feel make this game annoying as ♥♥♥♥.I liked the idea of this one not having the ""Transforming"" action of the next title, but I am having a hard time enjoying the game.  Several levels are buggy, and lag a ridiculous amount.  I had to stop and check my system, because I assumed it was a big update or something, causing the HDD speed to suffer.  No, it is the game.I don't know if that is just my rig, if something is weird right now, I dont know.  But I find it annoying, and it does not affect all levels.  The Billy Hatcher race has the worst of the first four tracks, really makes it hard to win a race.I tried adjusting the config, but it doesnt seem to matter what I put in, as it does not save it apparently.  Similar to issues I had with the Sonic Adventure games, and rather annoying to find big name products with so little bug support.If the game runs fine, it is a decent title to play. Not nearly as good as Transformed, but it is obvious what things were changed, and why.If you are considering a purchase, I would say go with Transformed.			",480,150,19,94,19,4,38

												Alright! Sonic and Sega All Stars Racing! I loved this game for Xbox 360! Getting it for my PC would make it look better right?!Suprisingly, no... But you know that isn't really my biggest complaint. The actual complaint I really have is the lack of custom control schemes. When I play games I use WASD set ups if I have to use a keyboard. Being stuck on arrows is bad enough.. especially since my right hand would do better for using other controls. But the fact that It doesn't support a controller for some reason, or at least my brand new out of the box Logitec F315. I had to go download Joytokey just so I can actually play the game with a bit of comfort. I am displeased about the lack of customizable control schemes.. but in a whole I still love the game.

Transformed has much more interesting mechanics, while this game had much more content from the start, a much more interesting announcer, and a more manageable unlock system. That being said, I consider Transformed to be better. If you want my advice, start with Transformed and then move on to this game.

												Even though Sonic and Sega Racing Transformed was a better game I have to say this game's pretty good on it's own right to. I mean It doesn't really help that it isn't technically a Sonic game,but just a Sega crossover game with sonic's name in the title to attract people,but I guess it worked because back when this game came in 2010 everyone was talking about it. So what is there to say? The graphics are pretty nice for my standards at least. Music and voice clips are reused from the franchise's games which I'll admit is pretty lazy,but Sega games have pretty good music so I'll let it pass. Track design is also pretty great having very unique twists and turns to them. Items on the other hand are pretty bad, with most of them being pretty uninspired and basic and they don't really hurt your position that much unless you're having a bad day really. This means that another aspect is focused on which is drifting which lets you charge a boost up to 3 times and I'll say the system works well for what it is. There's also some problems with this PC port like not having Online Multiplayer (Like c'mon really?) and some people say it doesn't have controller suport,but I'm playing  just fine with my Xbox controller. Overall Sonic All Stars Racing is a pretty great racing game,but I would also reccomend Transformed since it's such a great improvement.			",64,11,6,1,5,0,6

												I accidentally bought this after having tried Transformed. I prefer the latter, but my kids like this one better; it doesn't make them try to fly.  Both games include the ""catch up"" feature that gives more boosts and All-Star moves to players doing significantly worse than the computer; my five-year-old in particular loves going all-star.Beyond that, it's a typical kart racing game, with weapons, drifting, obstacles, characters from other games, and a nice variety of tracks.  Casual fun for the whole family, with a few Missions and Challenges (achievements) for the completionist.The split-screen mode supports up to four players, which would be perfect for our family if we had that many controllers.  (Like other Steam games, it seems to assume XBox 360 controllers, which means my PS-compatible controller doesn't really count.)  The Missions are only available in single-player mode, but most of the extra characters and tracks seem to be unlockable with ""Sega Miles"" that are racked up by simply playing nearly anything.

												A very solid kart racing title with a whole lot of nostalgia from the Sonic universe. Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing has a wealth of characters to choose from and each of their vehicles behave differently enough to make switching characters often an exciting prospect. Unfortunately, despite the large number of characters, most of them (notably all the ones from outside the Sonic universe) are completely uninteresting displaying Sega's continued reliance on Sonic for unique content. There are a reasonable number of tracks and they are full of challenges and obstacles which keep you on your toes even on the easiest (and therefore slowest) of difficulties. There is nothing particularly innovative in Sonic All-Stars Racing, in this regard it fails to match the interesting game modes introduced by Codemasters's F1 Race Stars. However, overall it is a much better game than that. Ultimately it fails to match the best of the genre, including the Mario Kart series and Crash Team Racing. But it is certainly up there with good kart racing titles such as Diddy Kong Racing and therefore is certainly worth a buy for a PC gamer interested in the genre. 8/10.			",114,10,19,26,9,0,20

												Honestly this game is just like mariocart but, with Sonic the hedghog and other Sega charecters.  The only issue I have playing this game is that it laggs from time to time using the most highest quality.  So pleas use this game on a computer console and not a laptop.  this is a very fun racing game and recommed you to play this game.			",66,4,2,5,1,0,0

												I definitly recomend this game. If your a fan of Sonic and old calssic games and racing. then this is for you!. All tracks are good they even brought back music that we all love. Memorable characters like Shadow billy Banaza bros and more.  But the thing is if you like to play by yourself or locally then i recommend this game. If you like to play online i recommend  sonic transformed. i rate 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a Mario Kart clone, in a good way. Most reminiscent of Mario Kart 64, as it's not too complicated or gimmicky. Easy to undersand items and a drift boost are your only concerns. It's simple, but focused, and it does what it sets out to do and does it well.I'd recommend this and it's sequel, Transformed, which is a throwback to Diddy Kong Racing. Kart games are fun, and these are two of the best available on PC. Snag 'em- especially if they go on sale.			",74,7,13,8,1,0,3

												Got this on a Sega Sale weekend and it has been the best find of the whole sale.  Works great, even on Windows 10, has good graphics (for a kid's racing game) and fun characters.  Controls are easy but fun.  Great for just picking up and having a good time.  Both my four year old and my seven year old really enjoy it.  It is great family game time.It is obviously a direct competitor to Nintendo's Mario Racing titles, but honestly the Sega one is better with better game play, fewer gimmicks and better graphics and controls.  We own the Wii and Wii U with all the Maria Racing titles and now that we have this, we will never play those again.  Sega totally improved on the formula here.  Nothing ground breaking, just a more solid, more fun family facing game.Multiplayer is local only.  That's too bad.  But local multiplayer is 2-4 players and works great.  Works perfectly with the Steam Controller.Sunshine Tour theme song really gets stuck in your head.  Love it.			",470,620,10,110,55,5,75

												Even though Sonic and Sega Racing Transformed was a better game I have to say this game's pretty good on it's own right to. I mean It doesn't really help that it isn't technically a Sonic game,but just a Sega crossover game with sonic's name in the title to attract people,but I guess it worked because back when this game came in 2010 everyone was talking about it. So what is there to say? The graphics are pretty nice for my standards at least. Music and voice clips are reused from the franchise's games which I'll admit is pretty lazy,but Sega games have pretty good music so I'll let it pass. Track design is also pretty great having very unique twists and turns to them. Items on the other hand are pretty bad, with most of them being pretty uninspired and basic and they don't really hurt your position that much unless you're having a bad day really. This means that another aspect is focused on which is drifting which lets you charge a boost up to 3 times and I'll say the system works well for what it is. There's also some problems with this PC port like not having Online Multiplayer (Like c'mon really?) and some people say it doesn't have controller suport,but I'm playing  just fine with my Xbox controller. Overall Sonic All Stars Racing is a pretty great racing game,but I would also reccomend Transformed since it's such a great improvement.			",64,11,6,1,5,0,6

												This is a kart racing game that while not as good as the Nintendo ones, it's still pretty good. It plays as you'd expect, with a drifting mechanic that rewards with boosting and with items that you can use against your opponents. There's 20 racers (8 from the Sonic universe) with enough differences between them, some more noticeable than others. There's 8 locations (3 from the Sonic universe) with 3 tracks each, totaling 24. The tracks are colorful and designed for drifting and boosting, although some are trickier than others. The soundtrack is ripped from the original games, but i only found it okay. The commentator is kind of annoying, but you can turn it off. However, there isn't much content here. The gran prix is just 6 series of 4 races in all of the 24 circuits. Mission mode is the most interesting one, featuring a mix of racing, battles, drifting challenges, and other things. Time trial is just that, driving through the stages to beat your best time. And there's some in-game achievements. The game is also easy, and i recommend you to play on expert. The steam version however lacks achievements, leaderboards, steam cloud, multiplayer (there's only split-screen) and trading cards. The game is good, don't get me wrong, but today it feels like it's a big prologue for it's much improved sequel, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed. It's like a preparation for that game. For cheap, i can recommend it, but don't expect much depth like it's sequel.			",267,164,6,30,13,4,38

 Sonic & Sega All-Star Racing Review! So I'll keep this short. If you enjoyed Mario Kart and like the cartoon style graphics and love racing games then this is a game for you. I havent played much but I do enjoy it for the most part. I can definitely see where it can get boring fast especially if you dont have friends to play with. It is similar to Mario Kart in a lot of ways like how you can drift and the whole look and feel to the game. The missions are fun and can pass the time as you want to get a AAA rating on them to unlock stuff. There are only so many Grand Prix races and I feel like once I complete those at 1st place, I wont want to do the missions but that is just me! Overall this game is an enjoyable racer that will keep you entertained for a bit. Its worth a try but dont buy it at full price.  Check me out on Youtube, Facebook & Twitch https://www.facebook.com/J0RENDI/?fref=tshttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9vV1Iy3lsZPryiRTmG6hOAhttps://www.twitch.tv/jorendi ",56,13,1,2,6,0,4

												While I prefer some of the track designs here to those in Transformed, baffling PC porting decisions make this not worth getting for most people. The big one is the lack of an online multiplayer mode, which today is pretty essential for a multiplayer focused game. The second is strange performance issues on certain stages that should really not have them. More powerful PCs should be able to get past that though. Regardless, in most ways this game has been replaced by Transformed. If you really want it, make sure you have a friend nearby for local multiplayer, as single player content is really lacking as well.			",70,20,4,16,17,0,7

												This Game is Great! I didn't have enough money for transformed so I got this one. At first glance great! but for some reason if I play it I go on grand prix and the first level no problem it's fine but then the second one is glitchy bugging out freezing it wasn't enough to stop me coming first but quit annoying I would probaly suggest just getting it for a consol but it is a good game when I think of all the glitches now I'm having ssecond thoughts but I'm a hardcore sonic fan and no sonic game is horrible (cough) (whispers sonic 06)			",76,9,2,4,6,0,0

												I remember when I was like 7 and this just got released and I begged my grandma to get me it after I got my Xbox 360 with 4GB of storage. I got this and played the h*ll out of it, and it was amazing, I raced with my favorite SEGA characters. I played this and MLB 2k11 for like 1000 hours in 2011, and I enjoyed it. I found this on Steam for 10$ so I'll write a review on this.Pros:It's very funAlot of SEGA characters make atleast an apperence You can replay this for alot of timeMultiple Lisences (saves)Doesn't take a beast to run itCons:It wasn't made for HD compleatly (if you have beast PC you can upgrade on config)Has horrible Keyboard controls, if you don't have some external controller, it sucksIf you don't know what drifting is, and how to do it you'll be screwed in non-beginner mode (learned in 2011)Overall: 7.5/10 It has some great gameplay, and if you can avoid the cons it's great.

												It is a damn crime how underrated this game is.   I had more fun with this than any other Kart racing game I've ever played.   I personally feel that it's better than Mario Kart, but didn't sell well because people aren't as familiar with Sega characters as they are with Nintendo's stable.   The tracks are huge and exciting and well laid-out, the racers are varied, the powerups are great, the drifting/boost mechanic is a blast, and there is a huge amount of stuff to unlock with the money you earn from racing, from new racers to new racetracks to new music!

												This is the best kart-racing game I've ever played. I know that sounds like a big statement considering greats like Mario Kart 64 are around, but this really is top of the crop. Transformed is great as well, but this game has more charm and more content. The levels are absolutely fantastic in this game, and most of them feel drastically different from one-another. It also must be said that the in-game announcer REALLY brings a lot of personality to the game. The graphics are still pretty top-notch. It doesn't look brand new, but playing in 4K, it's still a beautiful game that beats the hell out of something like Mario Kart 8. The replay value is off the charts, and it takes quite a while to unlock all that this game has to offer. It's a shame that this game will probably never reach Mario-Kart levels of popularity, because it truly is superior in just about every aspect. Do yourself a favor and BUY THIS GAME, regardless of the cost. It's beyond worth it.PROS-Great, colorful graphics and stages-Charming music with lots of great tracks-Nice selection of characters-Precise controls and challenging gameplay-In-game announcer is fantasticCONS-Difficulty can feel slightly cheap if you aren't experienced-Not much else!

												This Sega version of a Mario-Kart game is basically that, a clone, but a nice one. The games has many characters, courses and cups, good sega music and generic but well enough gameplay. The port is not great, and sometimes the game will present bugs if you do things like restarting, or with certain characters. Don't expect an amazing, but is definitely a  good option if you one to try one sub-genre that is not so easy to find in pc.			",1865,710,79,230,238,18,346
