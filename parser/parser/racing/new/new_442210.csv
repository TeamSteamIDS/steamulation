Early Access Review
Giant alien worm thing chasing you? Check. Hundreds of vehicles to use in your escape? Check. Loads of stuff to keep you interested? Eh. Switchcars is a vehicular rogue-like that feels a bit like a not-so-endless runner game. You begin as early as the 1950s (by default you start in the 80s), your goal is to drive your way to the 2050s while running away from what is best described as a giant, green killer whale. After three hours of playing what are generally five minute runs, I’m nowhere near beating the game but I’m also nowhere near giving up. Switchcars is pretty simple, because of this, you’re either going to like the game or hate it.Full Disclosure: A review copy was provided by the developer.The idea of being a tiny little human running away from a giant alien is a daunting one. Thankfully, Switchcars gives you just enough help to make this task possible, even if it is incredibly difficult. For the most part, you won’t even find yourself dead at the hands of the alien, you’ll find yourself splattered on one end of a high speed train or car. That’s what Switchcars really comes down to, switching between different vehicles. You can store up to three vehicles (that includes whatever you’re using) so providing you’re able to keep three good vehicles on you and you don’t crash too often then it’s actually quite easy to stay far enough ahead of the alien to reach safe zones (placed at the end of each one of ten stages a run consists of) with ease. Sadly that only happens in an ideal world, one filled with vehicles that are all super awesome.The game currently has one thousand vehicles in it spread out across the years, many of them with names. Ranging from tractors to racing cars, paragliders to jets and canoes to submarines. Of course, not all of these vehicles are as fast as a race car, or as armoured as a tank and so you’ll often have to make do with something slower or weaker. These are the really challenging parts of the game, the parts where you’ll need to quickly switch between vehicles in order to keep going and stay ahead of the alien. Every vehicle has a fuel and health bar and some vehicles also have abilities. Fuel is obviously drained by simply using the vehicle but there are refuelling points along the way, as well as repair points. The health bar of a vehicle is drained by, you guessed it, damaging the vehicle which happens when you crash into something or drive into lava, that kind of thing. For the most part, a vehicle’s ability is just a horn (or siren for emergency vehicles), it’s the more specialised vehicles that have the ‘cool’ abilities, like fighter jets with missile launchers or submarines with the ability to go underwater. Offensive abilities can be used to blow up obstacles in your path and even kill the alien chasing you (not sure what effect that has on a run since I haven’t pulled this off yet.)Speaking of paths, Switchcars has nine different lanes for you to drive, fly, or swim through. Six of these lanes are ground lanes, ranging from grassland to water canals to train tracks and the other three are for airborne vehicles. Airborne vehicles can travel along ground lanes too but generally there’s more traffic, and therefore more to crash into, down there. There are a hell of a lot of different lane types and most of the vehicles are only suited to one or two different types of lane so you’ll need to change up your vehicle roster accordingly when you enter a new area with new lanes. Now, though it does sound like it’s all about the vehicles, you’re actually able to get around on foot rather well thanks to a grappling hook. It’s pretty effective at pulling you towards stationary objects and speeding you up but it’s most effective when you pull yourself towards something going incredibly fast, such as a race car. Not only will you be able to catch up to a vehicle you otherwise wouldn’t have been able to, it’ll also pull you through the level a helluva lot quicker than you would have been going, even if you were in the vehicle you’re after. Before I move on to the negatives, I’ll quickly mention powerups, of which there are forty in the game. The powerups are dotted throughout the levels and range from machine gun turret attachments to helium balloons that’ll let you fly even the largest of cars. As long as the powerups don’t conflict, i.e. you can’t use two ability powerups, you can use as many of them as you want and there doesn’t seem to be a limit to how many you can carry. Although I have been enjoying the game thus far, it certainly has its negatives, one more important than the rest. You basically see all the game has to offer in the first two minutes of gameplay. Sure, the addictive nature of the game has been enough to keep me playing for just over three hours but in its current state will I go back and play more? Probably not. There are basic unlocks, like new lanes and later starting years, but there’s nothing that changes what is already a very simple game. There’s just not enough here to keep the game interesting for more than a couple of hours. You can see from some of the forum discussions that the lack of complexity means some people just don’t enjoy the game full stop. That may be the case for you as well, all I can say to that end is that I have enjoyed it but I do understand why others have not. It’s worth remembering that Switchcars has only just released in Early Access, so there’s every chance that it’ll be improved to a point where there is enough complexity to keep it interesting for longer but this review is about the game’s current state, not what it may become.I do have a couple of other issues with the game. The first, and hopefully soon to be fixed (this’ll be updated accordingly) is the complete lack of resolution support, Switchcars only runs in 1280x800 (16:10) which means anyone with a higher resolution monitor will have big black bars at the top and bottom of the screen as well as the game being slightly stretched out. The second technical issue I have is the complete lack of options, you have a control configuration menu, a fullscreen toggle, a music toggle and a camera shake option. That’s it. Taking the resolution support issue into consideration, the least I would have expected is a music and sound effect slider rather than just a toggle for music. Lastly, I did come across a few parts in a number of runs where there are no vehicles and nothing that you can use to pull yourself along with the grappling hook. This can be avoided by keeping a couple of backup vehicles of course but those may well run out of fuel or breakdown, especially as some terrain types damage vehicles (or the player if you’re on foot). I didn’t have this happen to me too many times but, as some people have said in the forums, these parts really slow the game down and I found myself losing the run either during these sections or shortly after.Verdict Switchcars may be too simplistic for some but for others it’ll be an entertaining and addictive experience, perhaps not for long enough to warrant a full price purchase though. If you think the game, even with its lack of complexity, is something you’ll enjoy then go for it, if not hold off for a sale or wait for it to get further along the development process to see if anything changes.Lone Ranger Reviews.El K.

 What is Switchcars? A simple but unique running game jammed packed with insane amount of vehicles (Cars, Boats, Planes, Helicopters, etc.) and they do not last forever, forcing you to make that crucial decision, ""Do I keep this car and continue on for a refuel platform or do I swap my superfast car for a moped as a replacement to keep going?"". Luckly you get three slots to bank your vehicles and some of the vehicles themselves have abilities, and if thats not enough there is also power ups which you can pick up and use, by using the power ups it will upgrade the current vehicle.Switchcars will be throwing you through many different terrains to traverse over, giving vehicles advantages and disadvantages.While running for your life you have been given a small timer, to give you a headstart to run as far as you can before the overly sized alien belly flops into your screen towards you. As you are making your way, dodging pass hazards and changing lanes for the safe zone, tension builds as you suddenly end up being chased by the overly sized alien, trying your best to get away from it at exhilarating speed, it always manage to get closer, destroying your vehicles and hindering you, until you are dead. The game just gets your blood pumping with a big fat smile to go with it. Now you do have a goal and it is to reach year 2055, as you get near to your goal more and more aliens will show up but what could be waiting for you in 2055? Well that is for you to find out. My Experience This game has a lot of unlockables which is great, it adds lots of content for a small game and many possiblity to the outcome of your escape or death which is more than other simple running games I have seen.I had tons of fun playing it but I did find the controls confusing at first, getting my button presses muddle up since you have to be in human form in order to take cars into the slot of your choice. Now I don't know whether its because of the graphic or simply because I am going blind but going at super sonic speed in this game just messed up my eyes, it was really hard to see but I was having so much fun I didn't let it ruin my fun.

								804 days ago I attended a Game Dev Gathering in Belgrade. Met a lot of nice people who were interested in games, particularly in making ones by themselves. One event was the star of that day. One dude brought a demo of a game he was working on for some time. The game was called Switchcars. I was actually the first one there to give the game a go, later there were bunch of people around that laptop constantly exchanging places around controls and cheering how the game is awesome. Real inspirational stuff. :) Just had a very interesting 2 hour session with the game and I can say that it hasn't lost any of it's charm but that it is even enhanced in that department. And since it's still in development we can only expect that this game will just get better and better. It's a unique game with very addictive gameplay. One of those titles that you can play in small sessions but also lose yourself in for hours. Lots of ""small touches of love"" that just warm up your gaming heart while you play.My wholeheartedly recommendations for this game, and I wish great sales numbers to the developer, he surely earned it with his hard work and unswayed commitment to this wonderful project!

								The game is already very fun in its 1st iteration on Early Access. The game is very playible with a high replayabilty. One minute I am scanning vehicles to see what would be the oddest thing to ride in, then suddenly the timer runs out and game get very frantic and tense. At this moment I realise putting the train wheels on the botton of my Go Kart was the worst idea ever.Crazy number of vehicle options and abilities to discover. I really enjoyed the soundscape and art style and look forward to seeing the game develop further.Opinions gathered from a quick hour play via stream earlier.			",1440,478,39,148,128,8,142

Early Access Review
								Steam recommended this game on release day so I checked out the videos and it looked interesting.  Over the course of the next week I watched a few let's plays which looked better and better, and saw how active the dev is with answering questions - you can see the guy's passion for this game, and he alludes to some really cool future features.Realizing this is early access, I am having a TON of fun with this game.  After splattering my head a number of times during the first hour, I find the game is pretty easy to learn.  Once you understand the controls it's a matter of experimenting with the mechanics to optimize your game play, but I feel like mastering this game still takes long enough to keep you coming back.The first few games I played I either died immediately (either splattering my head on a car/bus/plane/house, or jumping out of a car and getting run over on a racetrack) but after ~5 hours of playing I can regularly get to stage 7/8.  The unlocking system is really cool as the more challenging terrains only unlock once you get past a certain stage - the first time I was in the space stage it was pretty nuts, and the alien world where you can spawn 4 aliens if you don't have a car are hilarious.Even death can be funny as most games don't last more than 10 minutes, which I think makes this a rogue-like for people who don't normally like perma death.  You also have a graphical tally of all the cars you've used that run which is really fun to watch for some reason.  Each car you enter gets entered into a database which for completionists like me is great - with over 1000 cars I'm at 400 so far and loving it!One of the best things about this game though, is of course the cars!  You can store 3 cars to be swapped between at any time, and can always ditch a saved car for a new one.  The variety is staggering, and the small details in the pixel art is amazing (drive through a muddy level and your vehicle will get mud on it, that will slowly clean off as your drive away).  One of my early games I drove through a battlefield and got 3 different tanks, which I used to get stage 7, swapping when running out of fuel and blasting everything out of my way, including killing 6 or so aliens - very satisfying!  When not in a car, you have the ability to run around on foot with a permanent grappling hook which you can use to catapult yourself forward dodging the object as you approach, drag yourself closer to a vehicle to hop into it (several initial runs will be lost when learning how to enter the car as you as speeding towards it).  Most of the time you'll only be in the ""on foot"" stage for a split second as the swap cars.Scattered throughout the levels are powerups which range from cosmetic to amazing.  Repair all/ refuel all are fairly common (and highly useful), but there is something very satisfying with turning a battleship armed with rockets into an offroad vehicle, arm a sports car with a tank's cannon.  Because each object has a mass of their own, the lighter vehicles smash into pieces when hitting a heavy object/vehicle, but the big heavy vehicles can plow through almost anything.  The battleship mentioned above eventually was given nitrous (replacing the rockets - doh!) and smashed through EVERYTHING it ran into.  One of my first wow moments was finding and entering a stationary WW2 cannon, storing it for use when aliens showed up and swapping to it to blast them to pieces, eventually adding a fuel engine powerup so I can drive it.To sum it up, this game is very very promising for early access.  There are some quirks to work out, but the game ran bug-free for me and was highly enjoyable.  Also if you don't always have time for longer gaming sessions, this is a great game to load up for a few runs.  Very excited to see what new updates have in store! ",27,6,0,7,3,0,4

Early Access Review
I'm really on the fence with Switchcars. This review may very well change to a negative as more time passes. On one hand its got some really fresh ideas, great artwork, great pacing and feel - but on the other hand its debatably fun (and definately only in very short play sessions). I keep coming back, hoping to get that 'aha' moment where I'm utterly hooked, but that isn't quite happening yet.Essentially, you are near-endlessly running from a giant green worm. There is no storyline, which might help in this case. You have a countdown timer until the worm shows up. Until then, you are literally just moving left to right by the fastest means possible. You can keep three vehicles in your 'inventory' to seemlessly switch between. There are powerups/upgrades, but nothing feels too permanent because vehicles come and go out of your inventory fast. The running mechanic consists of switching lanes depending on the terrain type/vehical type combination, and any obstacles such as incoming traffic/buildings/clouds/etc.Overall it has the simplicity of a mobile game (and I don't mean that in a flattering way). The running mechanic is paper thin which is why it gets tiring after playing for more than a run or two. I don't think there are any meta-game unlockables, which would also be beneficial.Pros:+Nice artwork. Attention to details is great in this one - run through mud? It shows up on your car (same with slime from the worm). Lots of things like that.+Great great cinematic quality. It really feels like you are in a movie.+Fresh idea.+Controller support is good.+Music is appropriate.Cons:-Not really that fun.-Running mechanic gets tiring quickly.-Yeah there are a million cars and a million tracks, but really who cares. Yes they can feel different, but the spectrum is only so big. Fast cars are generally delicate, and slow cars are more tank-ish. Vehicles also vary by terrain (ie. water versus air, etc.).-While the big worm can be killed, its generally the end of the run when it shows up (or at least your seconds are numbered).The price is cheap, but I am very leary to recommend this game - its definately fresh, but also it is debatable how much fun you will get out of it. From talking on the forums, very few people really get alot of mileage out of it so far.			",561,161,5,75,79,8,72

Early Access Review
This review may be read in full below or you can view the review with glorious formatting and pictures in the Early Evaluation originally posted on Vox Ludicus - Living life a quarter mile at a time[voxludicus.com] A couple days ago, the people over at the Humble Bundle finally dropped their monthly bundle. There were a few standout games that caught my eye but i will be honest, Switchcars was not one of those games. However, once I decided to load up this ‘vehicular rogue-like’ game, I was pleasantly surprised. It was like finding that elusive piece of pizza that had been sitting at the back of the fridge for days, sure I was hesitant to try it at first, but after going for it, I was glad I did.‘Switchcars’ was developed by Slobodan Stevic, originally a 3d artist who worked on several games in the industry including, but not limited to, Space Engineers and Infinity: Battlescape. This experience is immediately evident as Switchcars boasts some impressive graphical details. The pixel art is distinct and colorful and your vehicle can get coated in mud and slime. The alien worm antagonist stands out vividly, with its bright green exterior and its hulking frame. One nitpick would be that the resolution seems to be currently locked at 1200×800, and as a result this leads to black bars on the screen when using a high resolution monitor.What is the goal of Switchcars? It is simple, you need to travel from the 1950s to the 2050s whilst at the same time trying to avoid becoming dinner for a tenacious and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off Alien worm. To achieve this, you have to constantly switch between vehicles. The game also features 9 different lanes. This may seem straightforward until you realize that the terrain also changes at set intervals during each stage. That car that you just had? Yeah it is in the river now. That is a nice train you have there, shame you are now on the road. This leads to some  intense and nail biting moments where you have to think on your feet and also have a contingency plan in place. You are able to save vehicles in 3 different slots but each vehicle can get damaged and depending on the vehicle type, will need fuel. There are 40 different power ups scattered across the 10 stages, some of these can upgrade your cars to get special abilities, like a helium balloon that allows you to take your car into the air, or a nifty turret that will destroy anything that was unlucky enough to be in your path.The game isn’t limited to just vehicular play. You can also roam around on foot and traverse the area with the help of a special grappling hook, although you have utilize this tool attentively or you may find yourself as road kill for the oncoming traffic. It was at these moments that I feel like a 2-bit Rico Rodriguez, grappling from car-to-car, furiously trying to get to the ‘safe zones’ at the end of each stage.The game has a variety of different vehicles to fool around with. Currently there are 1,047 different vehicles you can utilize in your bid to escape the aforementioned hungry alien worm. There are also 101 different types of terrains, this leads to the need for constant micro-managing of your 3 slots as you need to ensure that you have the different types of vehicle, be it a plane or a bike or even a train, to survive the game’s ever changing terrain. I have yet to master these tools and ascend to stage 10,but unlike Sisyphus, the rock shall one day stay atop the mountain and I will reach stage 10!It must also be noted that the game does have a few problems. Apart from the resolution issue, there is also no way to turn down the game’s sound. Only an option to turn on or off. Although I am sure the developer is aware and working on this. The game can also get quite repetitive once you have mastered the initial mechanics. This can get frustrating for players looking for more depth in the game. However, as the game is still in early access, the developer still has time to address these issues. Currently it is very fun is bite-sized chunks.Overall, just like in the game, there is still a long road for the developer to traverse. So far, the charm and fun that can be had from these short ‘runs’ through the game have been well worth my time. This game has only been released in early access on steam so I am sure there will be future updates that address some of the issues and improve upon the game play. So far it has been a fun and chaotic romp through the game’s stages. One day I shall reach the space craft in 2050!			",178,36,3,24,20,2,24

								Switchcars is a game in which you are given a certain amount of time to make it to the next safe zone, to try to get to your ultimate goal of reaching the year 2055, by using a variety of vehicles, which can include boats, planes, cars, helicopters, bikes, and more. However, vehicles either break down or run out of fuel very quickly, forcing you to find more vehicles to use in the many different terrains that you cross, in which some have dozens upon dozens of vehicles to use, and others have maybe 4 or 5. When the time runs out, an alien (or aliens) will appear and try to kill you. There are terrains that limit the alien's abilities, but for the most part, the alien(s) will be able to destroy any vehicle you have, forcing you to scramble towards the next safe zone on foot. You can also die if you are on foot and either have a vehicle hit you or if you use your grappling hook and hit the object you were grappling to too hard.Pros:-Easy to learn how to play/easy to play-Nice graphics-Fun-Many, many vehicles to use-The more you play, the more years you unlock (the later in time you start in, the easier it will be)-Many different terrains-Challenging-Upgrades that you can use to make your vehicles awesome-Technology gets better over timeCons:-No settings to adjust how loud/quiet the audio (the only audio setting is the option to turn music on/off)-No way of keeping any of your vehicles for more than about 15 seconds at the most, which kind of defeats the purpose of upgrading your cars-Way too easy to kill yourself by grappling into something too hard-Gets pretty repetitive after a while-Having alien lands attracting aliens even before the time runs out is way too hard. Many times I've been in the 2040's or higher and suddenly I'll have 2-3 aliens chasing me. One time I even had 4 aliens chasing me in stage 1. Once there's 3 aliens, the game becomes pretty much impossible because of the fact that you need to constantly change cars, but any vehicle that you try to get in becomes almost instantly destroyed and if you try to just run to the safe zone you'll get hit so many times that you die in about 5 seconds.

								Switchcars is the game that every infinite runner style game should strive for. The game looks initially simple, with a grapple hook player running on a field with the ability to instantly enter any vehicle and switch between 3 at a whim to take advantage of the different terrains on the map. The game randomly generates the course of terrain types and it's up to you to grab the most efficient vehicle for the track ahead. However, you slowly begin to peel back layers in the game that you weren't expecting. The game's timer doesn't simply end the game if you fail to reach it, it unleashes a chaotic worm beast that tries to kill you. If you grapple onto an object, it'll sling you towards it at breakneck speed (quite literally) and you must dodge or enter the object you grappled on to. Ambulances heal you while you drive, every vehicle uses fuel differently, there's powerups to change the vehicle's fuel source and terrain specility or add weapons. Sporting a rogue-lite system of unlocking new vehicles and tracks as you play, I highly recommend this game to any fan of rogue-lite games and those who enjoy the ""perfect run"" style games.

								Recently obtaining this game in a bundle, and playing it for a few hours the other night, I can definitely say I am impressed.  The game does a some things really well, for instance, the pace of the game is fast and suspenseful, there are a myriad of vehicles, and the idea is fresh and unique.  I find myself getting excited being chased around by a gigantic mutant fish who just wants to thrash all over my nice firetruck while i'm trying my hardest to escape and find a faster more suitable vehicle to escape in.  If there is one word I could use to describe this game it would be refreshing. Keep that in mind, but the game isn't perfect, it just needs a bit of polish.  Sometimes you wander through patches without any vehicles or items to grapple to, so you just flounder around while getting trounced by aforementioned irradiated slug.  Just running in a game based on speed feels arduous if you are mid-game, as you progress, you really dread those types of situations.Going to keep it short, but, I really enjoy this game, it has a lot of replay as no two runs are the same.  You can really feel the love and the time commitment of the devs.  I thoroughly enjoyed Switchcars, I feel that it has a lot of promise, and I would recommend it to my friends.

								A fitting and great soundtrack, awesome artstyle and the varied gameplay make this something you'll want to pick up. It can be frustrating at times but you always feel like you're progressing, and then you make it to the safe zones, heart racing. After one day of owning this game I can easily say it is one of my new favorites and I hope to see amazing things from it in the future!9.25/10			",198,32,3,18,32,2,21

								Switchcars is the kind of game that if I'd seen in the store, I would have given it a pass and moved on to something else. I was however lucky enough to try this game out purely because of my subscription to the Humble Bundle Monthly. I decided since the game was sat in my Steam library to give it a shot. I jumped straight into a game, and after being prompted to use the grapple hook, I flew straight into an oncoming vehicle which annilhilated me. As my blood and guts rested on the road, I decided to have another attempt and hit ""retry"". This time I ignored the prompt to use the grapple hook and managed to jump into a car and start driving... The feeling of not needing to change directions and only go to the right was oddly pleasing. But then I realised the challenge of trying to keep ahead of the time limit before some obese alien worm decided to attempt to squash me into a pulp. I also realised that to achieve this, I had to engage with the changing environment and locate and switch to the vehicle best suited for the environment. This is a game you'll pick up and be able to jump straight into, but also a game which involves some skill at being able to make quick decisions and assess... Do I change my helicopter for that boat with the mounted machine gun? Or do I keep flying away and escape the evil psychotic worm that refuses to be my friend?It's also a game where you will make poor decisions and learn from them. Don't accidently waste nitrous on your bicycle and smash it into a lorry... Will you spend thousands of hours playing this game and never leave your room for days? Very unlikely...Will you enjoy spending 15-20 minutes at a time in an entertaining and satisfying manner? YES.I'd say that even if I had purchased this game independently, I would have felt that it was a good investment. 9/10 - Would grapple into an oncoming vehicle again. Wouldn't waste nitrous on my bicycle.			",74,8,1,4,4,0,4

								I'm enjoying  Switchcars  a lot. I got it as part of Humble Bundle Monthly, and I looked at it and thought it was just going to be more bogus indie dev support. But, I find myself coming back to this game after every update, because I'm excited to see what's next. So here's the basic rundown of the game as of  Early Access Update 8.  Description of gameplay  Switchcars  is something along the lines of an endless runner games, like  Canabalt  and  Vector,  but with cars. Lots of cars. And boats. And planes. And really any form of transportation, along with hostile aliens trying to stop you. Also, instead of obstacles you have to jump over or slide under, you have different lanes that require ther own category of vehicles (i.e. boats need to be in water, cars need to be on roads, planes are best flying in the sky), along with obstacles that lie in your path that you need to avoid. You can pick up any car or vehicle you find on the road and store it as one of 3 vehicles you can choose, meaning keeping different vehicles for varying terrains is advantageous, or keeping multiples of the same vehicle so you don't have to stop and pick a new one when you run out of gas and can't refuel. Most vehicles have a unique ability that you can take advantage of {i.e. tow trucks have hooks to pull themselves forward faster, police vehicles have sirens that can stop or slow down other vehicles, and military vehicles have gun and cannons to destroy objects in their path). You can collect and hold up to three powerups, with a huge variety of effects, like vehicle alteration powerups such as installing electric motors, wings, or cannons on your vehicle; instant powerups, such as refuels and cool downs for abilities; and cosmetic powerups, such as car washes and paint jobs. All this leads to gameplay that requires fast-paced navigation and decision making to ensure that you keep going at the best rate possible.  Value and Replay Value  This is a game that just keeps going. There is a viable ending, but the journey and the fun of it has been so intense that I can't help but want to start over, and just keep trying. And, as I mentioned earlier, they're still releasing updates, meaning new reasons on a near-weekly basis to come back and try the game again. Right now, at it's current pricetag, you're getting a game with a lot of potential. There are bugs, which is expected of any Early Access game, but they get fixed often. There's also something left to be desired once you play the game for the while, but it's almost guaranteed to be added in the future, whatever it may be. The developer is listening to the community, and is adding in little details based on the communities interest all the time. It's a good thing they've got going for them, and I don't think they're going to mess it up.  The Essential Details   Positives    Fresh experience  Gameplay is consistent  While being consistent, there's a lot of variety  Developer is actively changing/creating the game  Decent price  Negatives    Number of bugs, though typically unnoticeable  Small development team (takes more time for bugs to be fixed)  Still ""incomplete"" (playing often may be boring) Conclusion  Switchcars  is a very fun game that is still changing and growing, and so far in the best ways. It has a low price tag and a fair amount of content. Overall,  Switchcars  gets my rating of  8/10 . It's not perfect, and still has a lot to do before it realy breaks the mold, but it's an enjoyable experience that I can't help but come back to again and again.			",221,66,0,20,16,4,16

								I'd never even remotely heard of Switchcars before it suddenly showed up in a Humble Monthly Bundle. Freshly released, it offered a fast-paced car-stealing, time-whale-escaping adventure that looked to me like some kind of bizarre mashup between an endless runner and Excite Bike. I didn't used to be a huge fan of roguelikes, but games like Switchcars really helped to change my opinion.Fast paced. Remarkably polished. Time Whales. Need I say more?			",846,214,29,101,88,15,98

								Interesting mechanic; simple but pretty fun. Wouldn't recommend more than 3-5 runs in a sitting. It's always really fun finding new powerups, lanes, and vehicles. Things like stealth bombers and tanks are really uncommon, but if you take care of them and baby them and feed them powerups they can stay with you a whole run and make you nigh unstoppable. As long as you don't crash them into a house or something. People who you see here complaining about cars coming and going too quickly for powerups to be useful are... *cough* bad *cough* at the game. Sorry.Overall I'd say it's fun and reasonably priced. Don't expect to play long sessions on it though.			",682,118,26,87,69,5,127

								My initial quick thoughts: Seems like a fun game- the whole idea being you're escaping an entity that is chasing you through time, so you have to keep running and driving vehicles as far as you can before they run out of gas, and you get caught. Pros:Game has day one support for controllers! (I'm using Valve's Controller- which is bomb by the way :) )- using the controller (did NOT test keyboard) controls feel pretty responsive and well thought out for controllers at least.Game starts with a quick tutorial- seriously- more games should do this and do it well. Tutorial shows you everything you need to do to succeed. LOTS of vehicles with different speeds and abilities (i.e. Policecar with lights)Lots of different terrain, and the vehicles have been made to have strengths and weaknesses depending on the terrain (it's pretty cool), eg. my snowmobile doesn't work very well on grass :) lolPowerups which can do things like nitrous, repair your vehicle, etc...Ability to store Vehicles in your inventory and swap them out- that was a nifty idea, allows for strategies as one becomes more adept in the game. Cons- only a fewNo option for native resolution- game only runs at 600x 800 currentlyIt's roguelike, which could be a pro or a con, depending on your tastes. I'm personally not the biggest fan, so when you die, you have to start from the beginning year, although as items and abilities become unlocked, they stay unlocked.			",1349,684,44,159,150,12,196

								Considering how fun the game is (in it's current state) and the fact that it was just released on Early Access two days ago... I have nothing but anticipation for the next thing they add into the game. More vehicles? More artwork? More game modes?The possibilities are limitless with a game so fresh.One thing that irks me is that there doesn't really seem to be any effect on the vehicles/environment over ""time"" in the game. I started out in 1950 and ran into a modern sedan! Other than breaking immersion (yes in a 2d pixelated game about running from a worm through time) it didn't really seem to matter that much as most of the entertainment value lies in the game it's self.All in all I'd give this game an 8/10 as of its current state.~March 6, 2016.

								Switchcars is a mixed bag for me, offering a fun and arcade type experience while honestly having nothing stand out. Before I start this review I must say I did get this game in a bundle for a very cheap price, but what I will say is that it is not worth the 9$ price tag on the store page. Let's get on with the review...GRAPHICSAs you can see from the screenshots on the store page, this game has pixelated graphics and well while it doesn't totally look like some nostalgic atmoshperic experience (and it isn't), the game won't want to make you gorge your eyes out. The vehicles in the game though look like a template with some different colors. I must say though the alien really surprised me when I first saw it, in a good way. This hunkering beast made me feel rushed and slightly scared to be honest.SCORE 7/10GAMEPLAYThe greatest aspect of this game. You start of the game at 1950 and try to get to the year 2055 while traveling in cars, boats, planes, and motorcycles. You travel in time by moving forward and advancing the years. Don't worry if you die though it only sets you back a few years when you start again. Sadly this gameplay gets quite repetitive and you wont be playing this game for that long of a time, but a very good experience it is.SCORE 9/10REPLAY VALUEAs stated above this game is quite repetitive and you will spend on average anywhere from 2-6 hours playing this game, but you might get addicted somehow or you might just hate it. Overall though it's quite a good value for an Early Acess game, with barely any bugs. Honestly feels like a full indie game.SCORE 8/10STORYNot much of one. In the year 2055 alien worms attack, and you somehow go back in time. Now you have to run away back to 2055 to escape these aliens and be safe forever.SCORE N/AVERDICTIn the end, Switchcars is a very great indie arcade game, that brings out something new to the runner genre. By the way this game is still in Early Acess, so new updates of bug fixes and new vehicles will come. For 9$ though, it offers quite little replay value and content, and the graphics aren't that prominent if that is what you came for with this indie game.TL;DR+Nice runner action+New and fun concept+Alien looks kinda cool+Wide array of vehicles~2-6 Hours of gameplay-Visuals don't stand out-Low replay value -Graphics in general look weak SCORE 8/10 ",232,31,0,33,33,0,11

								Pretty fun for a few rounds. pretty challenging. Another 8 bit game, basically a sideways runner, avoid obstacles, go as fast as you can. But you can switch vehicles depending on terrain and stuff. After a time limit you have an alien worm monster after you. My kids thought that was the most hilarious thing in the world the way it bounces around. The idea is to go through time warps until 2055. I think I got to 2023 or 2013 or something. Definitely difficult and very fast paced. My laptop said I had FPS issues.			",630,244,17,60,52,12,65

								Very fun game once you get used to the controls. The mechanics require mastering but didn’t take me long at all. The game’s difficult in a way that it intensely and constantly challenges your reflexes and concentration levels all at once. With perma-death being a thing, one wrong move and you die which ends the run entirely. I personally think it's a really well thought out idea and formula that makes the game really addictive. Would love to see the full release.			",145,15,4,6,17,2,13

								A few days ago I came into some money. Like any responsible person I spent that money on steam. I bought 3 games, two of which I returned, the third I've been playing every day since i bought it.Switchcars is the third game. It drew me in with it's art style and 'gimmick'. Said gimmick is switching vehicles at breakneck speed to adapt to your current terrain which changes every few seconds or so. Your goal is to travel from 1950 to 2055. Simple no? You'll be going much faster than 88 miles per hour though. The game gives you over 1000 vehicles to achieve this goal. Ranging from a rocket so fast that I just crashed it into an asteroid to...a shopping cart with no engine.Said shopping cart can be given an engine though through 1 of 41 powerups you find on your journey. Things like drills and rocket thrusters can adorn your vehicle as you hurtle forward through time. Of course you can't get to 2055 in one tricked out shopping cart. You have three vehicle slots which you can store vehicles in for a rainy day. A good variety of vehicles is necessary. Sure three supersonic planes sounds good and fast but they don't have that much fuel and are about as useful as...well a shopping cart when that fuel runs. Three solar powered race cars might be smarter but they wont be very good in an underground cave...full of lava. The three slots add a lot of on the spot thinking to the game which helps make the experiance engaging.I do have a few gripes. It is very easy to feel cheated when your last car brakes down on a rocky field where nothing drives and a space worm is doing a full body tapdance on you. It can also be easy to lose track of what you've driven before which makes completion a bit trickier. However the dev is very active in the forums addressing suggestions and problems quickly and politely.I personally reccomend Switchcars for one of those games you play for an hour or so every day. I would say to atleast wait for one major update to fix some of the bigger problems like resouloution and audio control but other than that I liked it. So go on, its a bit of fun for a relatively cheap price.			",157,16,9,24,32,0,10

								Trailer and the tutorial kinda show the whole game. Still very fun. If you love driving/racing games and roguelites this game is for you. I hope that being in EA and still in Alpha indicates that much more content would be added (as for 50 minutes of play there was enough variety between runs). 9$ seems kinda fair to me if you're into roguelites and the current state is stable (I did not encounter any bugs).

			We check out a quick runner game called Switchers. We dodge in and out of vehicles as we attempt to outrun some sort of inter dimensional fish of doom. It's pretty sick.		

This game is fun. It's super fast paced and includes giant green space carp worms? Anyway, it's definitely worth checking out.The player starts out as some dude just running around and, as quickly as possible, you'll jack a nearby vehicle to start moving right. The really interesting mechanic is how the map changes as you move. If you move far enough you'll pass through time rifts. These bring you to a new map with a different theme and different vehicles. Different terrain effects vehicles and the real skill is in knowing how to switch between vehicles smoothly.There's also the grappling hook. Quite frankly, that thing has it out for me. I've been killed more time by high speed collisions due to grappling hook accidents (I'm looking at you hot air balloon) than anything else. With a higher degee of skill however (or maybe just some skill), it can be a powerful tool to move you forward much quicker when you're on foot.If you take too long between safe points, giant green carp with teeth descend from the sky to wreak havoc upon your tiny, unprepared body. You just have to hope that yuou can evade the beast long enough to get to the next safe zone.The controls are very tight and each type of vehicle has its strengths and flaws. The graphics are good anough that each type of vehicle is distinctive while not being too distracting. Overall, it is definitely a great game to play when you have a couple minutes to spare. I'd say that it's worth the usual price tag, but would be an absolute steal on sale.			",136,67,0,23,37,1,28

It never mattered what type of vehicle it was as long as I could feel the fresh breeze against my face and the tranquility of driving along a deserted highway. Unfortunately for the protagonist in Altfuture's Switchcars, he does not have time to observe the scenery. Every second counts in the race to 2055 and he has to use whatever vehicle he can get his hands on to reach it. Does the simple, but hard to master gameplay help this game set a new record or does it slow down enough to miss the finish line?Driving against the flow of time and the creatures that look a lot like langoliers is unique for a genre usually trapped in a dungeon setting. The visuals, however, are the same retro Super Nintendo graphics that have been trending as of late. This is a considerable negative most of the time, but the developer has taken the time to give each biosphere the right amount of detail to make them really stand out. Most of the vehicles found in the game also have a defining look which I thought would be hard to pull off in such a limited, pixelated style. Upgrades also change  the look of the car with new tires, frame attachments and paint jobs. It fits strangely enough and allows everything to stand out amidst the total chaos of constantly switching from vehicle to vehicle at top speeds (against incoming traffic).The main focus of this game is combat though, more specifically the fight to stay out of combat. The only way to do so is by rushing through the ten stages during each run and reach the safe zone using your grappling hook while on foot and avoid incoming clutter such as houses and incoming vehicles. You have a wide range to use that each have a strength or weakness to traits such as speed and armor/ resistance or terrain (treads work better in desert, trains on tracks). With nine lanes (six ground mixed with land and sea, three air) and an ever changing biosphere, using the right vehicle is always a concern, so thankfully you can have a reserve of three to constantly switch to on the fly. This is where the mastery comes into play and while it can be more luck based than skill, identifying and utilizing specific upgrades to compensate for weakness can be enough to overcome this factor. Once the clock reaches zero, the giant whale-like worms enter the picture and will not stop trying to squish you until you manage to get to the next stage. Time is always counting down, so keep driving to the right and adapt to the environment.Unfortunately, this one trick pony can get extremely repetitive quickly and grind more on the nerves of the player than the gears of the vehicles. It can be very addicting in the beginning, but after a couple of hours this addictive high slowly wears off and the fight to reach the end starts to feel like a grind. More vehicles unlock, starting dates get closer to 2055, more lanes open up, but it is still the same game from the very beginning. There is no real complexity or improvement. Others might never run off the high created from the start, but in the end the game never evolves or offers anything other than what is introduced initially. Some other issues are still relevant with the game, but it is important to mention a lot of general bugs were already dealt with. What remains are some resolution errors that create a black screen display while in full screen and start up issues. Crashes do occur as well, but not as frequent before. Screen tearing can happen (most likely due to the speed of which environments are passing by). Frame rate drops did pop up in place of the screen tearing as well. Just something to keep in mind. The game is in no way a negative experience and presents a unique idea into a overused genre. Endless runners and rogue likes are too numerous to address properly and generally fall flat on entry. What some of these other games tend to do, however, is evolve over the course of the playtime in order to overcome the challenges. This adventure is trapped on the same rail from start to finish. It is a shame to say this when the game has such a quirky premise, but at the current point this game just is not worth a recommendation. Hopefully there might be some more variation added in the future, but until then this one trick pony is better off staying in the stables.Pros- Very clever premise- Detailed pixelated visuals with a catchy soundtrack- Can become very addicting...Cons- ...but loses it's initial flare quickly- Gameplay never evolves and seen what it offers in first couple of minutes- Crashes, black screens, start up errors			",1053,373,41,140,152,8,159

								I love the concept, and it's certainly a more in-depth and strategic breed of endless runner than anything else I can think of. The cool parts are everything that you see in the trailer, and it's as fun as it looks. The parts that frustrate me are getting stuck with a long string of crappy vehicles or only a single usable lane, how many vehicles look similar but are night and day in performance, powerups that do such productive things as turning your vehicle into a mutant railcar when there aren't any rails for miles in either direction, and the game currently hangs if you're playing in windowed mode and move the cursor outside the window.It's also incredibly easy to kill yourself with the all-important grapple hook intended to get extra momentum or snag onto vehicles. In fact I've lost every single game so far to a grapple suicide incident. Most other things including the time monsters will do gradual damage to your health, but if you forget to let go of the grapple button before catching up to the tree you're hooked on your friggin' neck just snaps like a twig. That seems like it shouldn't really be a thing.I like it though! Just some weird kinks here and there.			",611,127,18,38,40,4,51

								Game concept and play is really nice and interesting.However, before you buy this game, keep in mind that this game is early access n still in development.It's 8-dollar but I don't think it's worth it.After you reach the year 2055, there is really nothing to do.Of course hav endless mode, but soon you will be bored with simple play.It needs more contents that can be done with various vehicles.

								Hmm not sure what to say.  I think of the reasons I dont like this game and they seem weak to be honest.  But here goes:No mouse control on the menu which surprised me as I do not remember the last game I tried that did not have this.  Not a big issue.Graphics on a large screen is a bit too blocky (I know its pixel) I have played lots of Pixel type games and not sure these just did not look right.I love the idea and I had fun changing vehicles etc it just did not feel like I knew what I was doing, why I was doing it etc.Like I said my negatives seem weak.  But for the cost and what it is.  i feel its expensive even at 50%.These are my thoughts and some of you will understand and agree and some wont.  Its your choice.Someone else said that is a £1 mobile game.  I agree and that after an hour you be bored.  Again I agree.			",172,33,6,22,51,5,58

My little time spent in this game was used to switch from car to car making it as far as possible. At its core is a $1 mobile game with low resolution. Ir'd be a shame for anyone to spend $8 on this. Theres a lot of cars, planes, ect. But is it any fun? No. Its not. the most hours you can spend in this is probably one. One measly hour.			",296,50,5,37,25,2,34

After the first minutes Gameplay I was so amazed about the Framespeed & the possibilities that I became addictive. :PThis game has NO CONS! It is still in Development and is fun from start till you click Exit.The Game will show some Emotions in you, which you havnt noticed till now.Chill, Panic, Impression, Rage, but you will start the game again....

Interesting Concept ! Fun Game !I really enjoy the game which is for me a mix between fast-paced , strategy and action.Don't ever try to stop in this game or you will die. Try to take control of cars , bikes , airplanes and more.You have nearly ""unlimited"" possibilities to go forward and finish the game (which has a career mode)Or you can simply enjoy free ride.More Modes are definetly going to be added (maybe you as a player can suggest an idea to the developper :) , as this game is still in Early Acess)In conclusion : I really like this game even if I haven't played for so long.It's definetly not a game to play for hours.But it's a like a mini-game.You play for 10min or so and then you move on.Other Examples :Download another game , play this fun game to shorten the waitYou have to wait for the pizza , play this fun game (or speak with someone )You have only 10min or less , play this game You are tired , but still want to play for 10min , then play this gameThanks for reading :)			",185,45,6,8,18,2,14

								Figured I will leave a review for this game.Pros- A lot of fun, very easy to play, very tough to get good at dodging the aliens- Author was being serious when he said two gameplays are never the same. I love the randomly generated biomes and the random mixes that can happen, although sometimes it's quite frustrating to not have an appropriate vehicle for the biome, it is a lot of fun to try and beat the clock with what you have.- Really unique concept. I have never played a game that is in the same genre as this one. It's fast paced, brutal difficulty, and the art style is beautiful.Cons- Issues with fullscreen mode and windowed mode. Sometimes game forgets that you want to play in window mode and it loads up fullscreen thus messing up the window sizes of all other open applications- Progression is a bit confusing. Game seems to add +2 years to the starting year every time you have a semi-successful run (more than 20 years skipped)			",201,31,3,20,21,2,16

The vehicles in the game play really different, and the feeling of changing from car to car, ugrading or changing them as you go, is a fantastic.I brought Switchcars to a game night with my freinds and they all had a blast. The discovery of the ins and outs of the games is satisfying and the game conistently provides a challenge as well as rewarding you for skill.Pro Tip: if you can, go into the game unspoiled. The first time you find a new vehicle or get body slammed by a giant space worm is surprising and a fun experience.			",182,34,7,23,20,3,32

								This is such a bizarre yet lovable game. The basic premise is that time is falling apart or something and these giant alien slugs are after your for unexplained reasons. How do you escape? By hijacking every vehicle you come across in a mad dash for 2055, where supposedly all will be well again!PROS1. Unique concept2. High quality music and sound effects3. It's only in Early Access, and it could definitely grow to be an even better game4. Brimming with sheer, unbridled joy at the hilarious inanity of it allCONS1. Tutorial really doesn't describe much. You're just given the keys to the car and told to go2. Some of the powerups seemed really useless3. Still a bit buggy, but again, it's in Early Access as I write this review, so it'll likely improve4. Even though levels are proceduraly generated, there isn't that much in-game variability, so replay value is fairly low. This makes makes any cost above five bucks for this game seem a little priceyOverall, a fun game that's perfect for killing those small blocks of time you weren't sure what to do with anyway. With a few more refinements, and maybe a few more bizarre alien creatures to flee, this game could really be awesome. If you have a few bucks and some time to kill, this game is a great option.8/10 Explosions			",29,17,0,0,1,0,0

Interesting Concept ! Fun Game !I really enjoy the game which is for me a mix between fast-paced , strategy and action.Don't ever try to stop in this game or you will die. Try to take control of cars , bikes , airplanes and more.You have nearly ""unlimited"" possibilities to go forward and finish the game (which has a career mode)Or you can simply enjoy free ride.More Modes are definetly going to be added (maybe you as a player can suggest an idea to the developper :) , as this game is still in Early Acess)In conclusion : I really like this game even if I haven't played for so long.It's definetly not a game to play for hours.But it's a like a mini-game.You play for 10min or so and then you move on.Other Examples :Download another game , play this fun game to shorten the waitYou have to wait for the pizza , play this fun game (or speak with someone )You have only 10min or less , play this game You are tired , but still want to play for 10min , then play this gameThanks for reading :)			",185,45,6,8,18,2,14

								Figured I will leave a review for this game.Pros- A lot of fun, very easy to play, very tough to get good at dodging the aliens- Author was being serious when he said two gameplays are never the same. I love the randomly generated biomes and the random mixes that can happen, although sometimes it's quite frustrating to not have an appropriate vehicle for the biome, it is a lot of fun to try and beat the clock with what you have.- Really unique concept. I have never played a game that is in the same genre as this one. It's fast paced, brutal difficulty, and the art style is beautiful.Cons- Issues with fullscreen mode and windowed mode. Sometimes game forgets that you want to play in window mode and it loads up fullscreen thus messing up the window sizes of all other open applications- Progression is a bit confusing. Game seems to add +2 years to the starting year every time you have a semi-successful run (more than 20 years skipped)			",201,31,3,20,21,2,16

								I've never seen a game like switchcars before. The vehicles in the game play really different, and the feeling of changing from car to car, ugrading or changing them as you go, is a fantastic.I brought Switchcars to a game night with my freinds and they all had a blast. The discovery of the ins and outs of the games is satisfying and the game conistently provides a challenge as well as rewarding you for skill.Pro Tip: if you can, go into the game unspoiled. The first time you find a new vehicle or get body slammed by a giant space worm is surprising and a fun experience.			",182,34,7,23,20,3,32

								A little expensive for what it is. HOWEVER it is an excellent game that is totally worth it on sale and I find myself wanting to play it in those little moments of spare time. A very fun game developed by a single individual (for the most part) who either loves or detests fish.			",30,0,1,6,7,1,13

								It's like a driving away from graboids simulator, except the graboids wear pants!It's a bit expensive for what it is. Maybe $5 would be a better price point. Once they start adding in some more stuff (e.g. achievements and more content), it'll be worth a higher price.The game development seems to be progressing quite nicely.			",308,111,7,67,36,6,50

								When I played this Game the very first time I start to think: What the... is wrong with this Developers Head? He is a genius. I play Games since more as 25 years and no I see a title which looks similiar to much games from my childhood. After the first minutes Gameplay I was so amazed about the Framespeed & the possibilities that I became addictive. :PThis game has NO CONS! It is still in Development and is fun from start till you click Exit.The Game will show some Emotions in you, which you havnt noticed till now.Chill, Panic, Impression, Rage, but you will start the game again.... I know it.Facit: Buy it or regret it! Its worth every coin! ",116,4,0,14,12,0,9

								Great little game to jump in and out of whenever you need a quick unwind. The art is nice and clean, the gameplay is a simple concept executed well. I've only got a couple hours on it and have already unlocked Hardcore (and the later stages don't seem so different) so perhaps the difficulty is a bit on the lower side but still quite enjoyable. Only real issue is the lack of options to change audio levels or tweak things like graphics and whatnot.			",239,26,7,32,16,0,60

Early Access Review
								For Switchcars, the main question a future game buyer may ask is ""Can I wait?"" Obviously, it's not because the game is unpolished and far from good standards, or because there is unreleased content that was promised by the developer which wasn't delivered. Essentially, what you the buyer needs to know is whether or not you can live with two types of gameplay as of the moment of writing, or wait for a better chance down the line where the game may (or may not) have more to offer for you. The gameplay concept is a basic one at first glance, but there is meat to it. Just don't expect massive lists of controls; you enter vehicles, you exit vehicles, you install and use powerups, and move. That's about it. The reason why this works so well is because there isn't a single run you will make that feels the same as a previous one. The vehicle variety is enough to distinguish countless eras and classes of vehicles, the powerups add plenty of possible variations to said vehicle variety. Want to see if you can move a gun turret? That's possible. Do you think a train would work better with a rocket thruster? Have at it. Finding these combinations of vehicles and powerups is a part of what makes this game fun, the rest being made of the adrenaline which comes from running away from aliens with a limited time frame. Needless to say, this game isn't without its issues. The main one is that while there are two types of game modes, there aren't fleshed out yet; the Run and Hardcore modes are only different in difficulty and session length, and the Free Run mode still lacks the flexibility of a proper sandbox mode. This means that if you play the game for long periods of time, you may get bored easily if you are looking for mode variety and not things to do within said modes. And if you dislike grid-based games, you are not going to like this one, because the grid-based movement is key to how the game is played. But as I said before, no one knows what will be done to this game in terms of future additions. Things like Steam Achievements have been teased, so they are a plausible possibility, and other things like resolution support are available, albeit in Beta format. For me, this game never gets boring because of the powerups and the vehicle variety which is currently offered. But if you love to have countless game modes and hunt for achivements, the game doesn't quite offer that just yet. If you love fresh concepts and pixel game hommages, give this one a go, certainly... But be prepared to fight some mean green aliens!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Windows 10 kinda ruined it...I downloaded the app pre-10 and had it for a while. I LOVED THE GAME very much. Unlike other Steam games, which I stopped playing after a while, I kept coming back to Switchcars time and again. However, since I upgraded to Windows 10, it got really laggy. I don't know if it's my PC or if it's the game, because I got Windows 10 after the most recent update. Bets are it's my PC. Aside from my PC being laggy, this game is SOLID. Music is great and, having played the game several times, doesn't get annoying. Glitches are far and few between, the controls are easy to remember, yet complicated enough to give  you a challenge, and the level design and sheer amount of vehicles are just fantastic. Windows 10/10 would drive baby aliens again.			",5,1,0,0,7,0,2

								Hard to say exactly why I find this to be so much fun, unless ""Using a rocket propelled laser blasting armored ice cream cart to run away from a giant alien fish"" works. Or maybe a solar powered teleporting racecar on tank treads. Or a steam train on skis with a rocket launcher. Or a non-giant alien fish. Or maybe a cow. Or all of them.Also, you can put nearly any powerup on nearly any vehicle, regardless of if it's a good or bad idea.Hot air balloons and tanks do not mix. ",200,40,0,55,21,1,47

								This is a great early access title. It is fully playable in its current form. I'm sure there are bugs somewhere in the game, but I did not run into anything that caused a crash or that seemed to be out of place during my playthroughs.Switchcars is a side-scrolling, vehicle ""running"", rouge-like game. It succeeds in drawing you back in when you fail (as these types of games should) even as it seems absolutely bent on frustrating your every effort to reach the end.At 8.99 it is a bargain already and if you have any interest in the game or enjoy the genre, I would suggest not hesitating to pick it up. I was able to reach the end at just under 8 hours. I have no idea if that is ""fast"" or ""slow"" for others. Regardless it is not a bad dollar per hour exchange. Despite the time spent, I have only unlocked a little over half of the avaialble vehicles - so if you are a completionist, there's loads to find.As development continues I'll be checking in to see what new challenges and content await.

								Swichcars is fun arcade game based on the absurd premise that spacetime has just given up. It's a really enjoyable fast-paced game. Defnitly fits in the endless runner genre but It's so much more. The well thought out design and depth will keep you coming back. The best part is the develpers endless attention to detail. As of this writing, the develper is still regularly pushing updates in order to help refine the small details. Highly recomend!			",13,1,0,3,11,0,4
