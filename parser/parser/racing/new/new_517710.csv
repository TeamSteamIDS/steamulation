												Absolute blast! Best Wipeout successor! However a shame that I don't have a 360 or ds4 controller. I tried it on m/kb and my Steam Controller but this game MUST be played on a classic controller with 2 analog sticks, it's crucial to get the most control out of it for pitching and strafing which you will need to do. A lot.			",59,12,2,3,7,0,3

												I deleted my original review and put a few more hours into the game to see if some of my original crits could me remedied through practice. After a few more hours into it I can safely say my problems aren't me not knowing the tracks well enough or the car I chose, it's the game. Pros- Art direction is good with a really polished look. - The better track designs are well designed*- The music works. Some cuts are good others are totally forgettable but it could be worse so this is a ""pro."" - Good sense of speedCons- AI is absolutely terrible. At first I thought i didn't know the tracks well enough to compete and hit the walls too many times to catch up. But after spending some time in the Pure Time Trails and getting in the top ten in the leaderboards in a couple or tracks and the top 50 in others, I saw first hand that racing against the computer is broken. If you lose first place during a race or last man standing, forget about it. You simply can't catch up. I tried different loadouts in the car, different tactics during the race. No go. I absolutely could not catch any car ahead of me after I lost first, second or third place.- No racing game is good when it favors hitting the walls instead of tactical driving to get the best times, which is exactly what RedOut does. That's exactly how I broke into the top ten on the leaderboards. I was trying to race with precision initially, breaking and taking turns trying not to hit the walls. The game actually punishes you for this as you have to break the car down so much to the extent that you simply can't compete. The cars simply drift too much for it to matter and you almost have to come to a dead stop at times. The times posted trying to achieve perfect laps will never be very high and in some cases you simply can't get the gold medal for events. Once I started hitting walls I noticed that I maintained more speed going into turns as opposed to breaking into a clean turn and boosting afterward. Totally backwards and not how a racing game should play unless it's something like Twisted Metal.- The cars drift a bit too much making them a chore to control. Even with mag/grip upgrades my car would drift too much even when turn early AND strafing. It's not as bad as Formula Fusion where the controls are so bad you'll be lucky to finish a race let alone win it. But for this to be a WipeOut/F-Zero clone, how do you screw up the controls even early in the game?RedOut is trying very hard to be a F-Zero with WipeOut art direction. But anyone that's played WipeOut and/or F-Zero and gotten good at them knows the controls are very tight. RedOut's controls simply aren't that good. To ask the gamer to navigate rollercoaster tracks at high speed with cars that drift too much even after upgraded, AI that cheats to the extent that you can't catch them  and hitting the walls is a way to win is just sad. What's worse is that with some practice I was able to compensate for the floatiness of the cars. But the suspect AI and sloppy wall hitting tactics ultimately killed it for me. I regret this purchase as I was looking for something on Steam that could compare to WipeOut or F-Zero. RedOut isn't it. Don't let the pretty graphics fool you. You'd be better off emulating  WipeOut Pulse or F-Zero GX. Both are better games. RedOut is a bad imitation in a very pretty wig.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Anti-Gravity Racing is BackAnti-Gravity (AG) racing has been a niche racing subtype that was once made popular by the legendary F-Zero, WipeOut, Rollcage, and POD series. Dominated by kart racers and racing sims, AG racing is making a comeback in full force with Redout. Known for its combat racing and high-octane, high-speed aesthetic, Redout’s take on the nostalgic genre will appease many fans waiting for such a release, while welcoming all those that may be new to the racing subgenre. Also, VR support is optional, and a photosensitivity warning is presented upon launch, so take care.GameplayCareerCareer is the traditional career-style progression system where you win to earn experience, level up and purchase upgrades. You first start by choosing one of six sponsoring teams and a ship. Beginning with a Class I ship, a slew of various races and race types are presented for you to undertake. These races each have certain goals, and how well you perform dictates the resulting experience and money awarded. Contracts are interspersed throughout the campaign which task you to fulfill certain objectives for a particular reward. Overall, there will end up being 75+ events to race with 23 (excluding the starting) ships to purchase. If you happen to only be interested in single-player modes, there is definitely a sufficient amount of content to keep you busy.  Quick RaceThere are 10 different race types you can setup, including Time Attack, Speed, Survival, Instagib, Race, Pure Race, Arena Race, Last Man Standing, Score, and Boss. The major differences between these modes lie within the restrictions regarding health, damage, powerups, speed, enemy performance, and time. Speed, for instance, provides additional turbos encouraging you to stay above a target speed in order to get bonus time reductions whereas Last Man Standing eliminates the pilot in the last position every lap. There is a mode to highlight every style and preference of play, ranging from solo handling performance to group defense performance.OnlineAuto-join, manually search, or host a race with 12 pilot multiplayer support. All Quick Race options/game types are available for selection. Local coop/split-screen doesn't seem to be supported yet.Ship CompositionEach ship has 6 different stats to take into consideration when selecting a starting racer, including: acceleration, max speed, grip, structure, energy pool and recharge speed. Other than the physical and mechanical properties altering handling behavior, two important characteristics of each ship that must be maintained in-race are the health and energy meters. Grinding the sidewalls and track floors will reduce health while utilizing turbo and powerups will reduce energy. Keeping a harmonic balance between the two meters will ensure the highest turbo speeds and survival.Careful utilization and mastery of the powerups will help you take over any competitor. Some of the unique items at your disposal include additional turbo, shields, self-repair drones, energy disablers/drainers, slipstream enhancers, and more. Also, these powerups are not in-race pickups. They are equip-able modifications that either passively affect the ship, or must be actively utilized in-race. These powerups can also be upgraded even further, and only two powerups may be equipped at any time (one active, one passive).Ship HandlingRedout's handling is best described as floaty (in a good way). This doesn't mean that it's unresponsive, insensitive, or overcompensated. Just that there is a realistic sense of feedback and control; realistic as in something expected of a futuristic anti-gravity racing ship. As mentioned by the developers above, the handling was based upon physics derived from quad-copter controllers and real magnetic forces.Advanced handling features include strafing (which is completely different from drifting by the way), pitching, and turbo boosts. Strafing is extremely important to keep your over-zealous self from bumping into every wall while pitching helps prevent blackouts, redouts and nose/tail grinding when a track decides to go loopy. An important feature that the developers wanted to incorporate is the fact that there should always be a way to confront a corner without braking. It may take precise steering, strafing, and boosting, but must definitely be possible. I found the complexity of a successful no-brake turn in Redout much greater than a kart racer’s turn (drift/handbrake), but much simpler than a rally racer’s hairpin turn (Scandinavian flick technique).

 PresentationArt DesignRedout employs a very futuristic aesthetic & diverse world - 20 tracks are available for racing, taken place around 4 locations (Cairo, Alaska, Abruzzo, and Volcano) that must be unlocked in Career mode before free use. The 4 locations each have a unique biome: desert, arctic, jungle, and lava respectively, and Redout’s variation of these biomes ensure that each track feels very different. Another important aspect regarding Redout’s art design has to deal with its sense of speed. The game utilizes heavy vibrations, passing landscapes, high-speed collisions, and extraneous sounds to improve immersion and create a high octane, adrenaline rushing experience.Screen Resolution & Full-Screen SettingsCurrently, there is no method to change your screen resolution or windowed/full-screen settings in-game. In fact, you can't even tell what resolution/full-screen setting the game has set you up at. This ended up giving other players issues with external software/GPU technology (FreeSync, VSR, etc.). Fortunately, for now, an unofficial guide has been created to inform users how to manually edit an .ini file to alter these settings (Guide Here) with successful results.VerdictThere is an unfortunate lack of tributes to the racing legends that were once popular near the turn of the century, especially on Steam. Becoming more and more niche by the year, Redout breathes life into the dying combat racing genre. Furthermore, it lives up to the pent up expectations that many AG fans, including myself, have longed to express. This makes it extremely easy for me to recommend Redout to all of the AG and realistic combat racing junkies out there. Setting aside a Millennial's nostalgia for a moment, I want to address Redout's mainstream appeal. I'm sure that there will be a large portion of gamers that are not too familiar with AG racing, and wonder if Redout will be worth it. The only thing I can say to this group, is that Redout is one of the most unique racing experiences on the market, especially one that is released recently – I can’t stress that enough. If you're only familiar with this decade's kart racing games, or racing sims/rally racers, just understand that AG racing has a different feeling and difficulty to it. When I first played F-Zero GX and Star Wars Episode I: Racer back in the day, I couldn't believe how sensitive the vehicles were and how difficult it was to survive and succeed. I'm sure many newcomers will feel the same way at first, but as eye-opening as F-Zero GX was to me, I believe Redout could be the same to you (in a good way). I welcome any and all newcomers to the AG racing genre with Redout. Its relatively simplistic controls and combat system, along with adaptive AI, makes this AG racer very friendly to beginners.

												Got to the last event in the career mode.  Couldn't blink for 30 minutes for fear of crashing and burning and my eyeballs were aching.  Totally worth it.Some other cool moments came up too somewhere in the middle of the game where you finally get the driving mechanics and you're drifting consecutively through two or three zig-zags without missing a beat.  What a great feeling of control when you're just nailing turn after turn.  Ship designs are to die for, and the whole aesthetic is simply amazing.  F-zero style graphics with Wipeout design choices and gameplay to do both proud.			",157,20,1,16,6,0,19

												F-Zero GX is my favorite game of all time. I have kept a GameCube set up and ready to go since GX's release just so I can play it. In fact, it's the only GameCube game I have ever owned. My GameCube exists only to play F-Zero GX. And every night before bed, after donning my GameCube in its protective cover, I kneel over my pillow and pray that Nintendo will make a faithful PC port so that I can cease taking the Xanax I need to ease the ever-present anxiety that my GameCube will one day stop working, thereby rendering F-Zero GX a mere relic of history.With that out of the way, let me say that Redout is not F-Zero GX. It is far more like Wipeout XL than it is like F-Zero. Unfortunately, this means that it is not the game it could be. Every way in which this game deviates from being more like F-Zero GX in favor of being more like Wipeout XL is a way in which it fails to live up to its potential. That is because Wipeout XL is exclusively worse than F-Zero GX. This game begs for tighter steering and more precise strafing. It pleads for modular vehicles and tuning options that introduce sacrifice rather than serve merely as strictly beneficial upgrades. It demands best-time ghost saves that can be raced against.Those things being said, this is truly the best futuristic racer I have played since F-Zero GX. It is fast feeling. Really, really fast feeling. Ironically, this is rare in the world of racing games. Although in terms of mechanics this game is more Wipeout XL than F-Zero, in terms of quality it is far more like the later.---------------------EDIT: I almost forgot: The most annoying feature of this game is that F-Zero's control scheme isn't an option. Would it really be so hard to offer a control scheme with R and L strafing and the button for boost on the controller's face? Would it? Unfortunately, I have not mastered the the ""4-fingered shoulder grip,"" so boosing means having to sacrifice my ability to left strafe for the duration of the boost. Super frustrating (not really that bad, but still... it's the principle). Just let the user define their own inputs!			",121,54,1,8,5,1,11

												Where to start?...First and foremost, this game NEEDS to have a Demo. This genre will have the most critical and skeptical players of nearly any game genre out there. I'm sure, me saying I think it's amazing is overshadowed by the experience we all had with F-Zero, Wipeout, and many of the other gems this genre holds, as well as many experiences with clones and wanna-be games... But, here we go…Also, if you've made it this far, there will be no Too Long; Didn't Read skip phrase here. This review will be long, but I will give as many examples and comparisons as I can. With that all out of the way, let us get started.This game, as I see it, relates to several other gems of the genre, as well as some outside of the genre, and is overall a great Anti-Gravity racing game. I would compare it to F-Zero, as well as Wipeout, as many others have, I'm sure. However, I would definitely compare it to the N64 Star Wars Pod Racing to some extent, as well as Hydro Thunder (Both the N64 original, as well as the XBLA sequel). This game would also be comparable to any of the great Racing Sims out there (Gran Turismo, Forza, Assetto Corsa, Dirt Rally, Etc… Whichever you like best.)Redout takes most of the greatest aspects of all of these games and puts it alongside a great sensory pleasure of fantastic, stylized graphics; an amazing soundtrack (Which we ALSO need to be able to buy) and tight, responsive controls.From F-Zero, it simply brings the Speed, as well as the difficulty. In terms of speed, the first class of craft you can pilot reach roughly between 800-1100 KM/H, Which is comparable to F-Zero, and is naturally the slowest class in the game. This wouldn't be so staggering if the fastest vehicle in class 1 only filled up the 'Speed' stat only 1/5th-1/4th of the way (Depending on upgrades). The majority of Class 3 and up Crafts have near max 'Speed', as well as near max 'Acceleration', which, though I'm far from acquiring, I would assume is beyond insane.From Wipeout, there are the power-ups, however done a little differently. Instead of picking them up mid race, you equip them to your craft, which is an interesting decision, but it fits very well within the game.From the Star Wars Pod Racing, it takes a somewhat similar overall feel. Craft collisions are a huge part here. You either race to wreck, or race to avoid, and either is very manageable, so long as your reactions are quick enough. There is also a simple Boost mechanic, limited by a constantly recharging energy pool, which also fuels your power-ups.From Hydro Thunder, there is not just the visually stylized Craft. Unique, varied choices not only in looks, but they all legitimately feel different. Some have similar stats, but they all handle very differently from each other.From the Racing Sims, it brings a level of realism. This game is Challenging. It handles like a twin-stick-shooter, but it's a racing game. You HAVE to use both analog sticks simultaneously (And I would definitely say a controller is a must) as well as have at least a basic understanding of how to take corners or you will fall behind very fast. This game's idea of failure isn't when you die, you must restart, but more so watching your opponents lap you when you get too cocky on one of the harder tracks. This game handles very well for an Anti-Gravity Racer, and though it is unique, it is what I suspect will set the new standard for what this genre should aim for.The only downside I have for this game would be the requirements for it. I meet minimum requirements, and still, the game runs very poorly. I will say, however, this game easily is the game I will build my next PC around. It is playable on the lowest settings for me, but it is quite obvious this game, brought to its full potential, is quite the benchmark and indeed, beautiful.I would definitely argue this game will be what defines the Anti-Gravity Racing Genre for the next generation. The tracks are technical, the FOV and sense of speed is beyond anything else on the market, the controls are tight and responsive, and there is plenty of content to keep you playing, as well as Online Multiplayer. In terms of a Racing game: 10/10. Overall, stacking up against any other game: 9/10. Easily a staple in my library, personally. One that I will come back to quite consistently. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												[UPDATE] The rubber banding I experienced at first is only a problem in the beginning, it seems. After some ship upgrades I have been able to beat opponents by more than ten seconds. Still enjoying the handling and feel of everything, although I wish the career had a little more character - some rival portraits would have gone a long way, for instance. Still, the game so far is pretty much what I hoped for, and I hear there's even a proper time trial mode on the way. I will add my final thoughts when I've progressed far into the campaign and played some multiplayer.[First impressions] - game is extremely pretty; an explosion of colors and sexy futuristic shapes. The controls are tight and demanding. Really does feel like a cross between Wipeout and F-Zero. I'm a little worried about the AI though, it seems to have a lot of rubber banding.

												Possibly the greatest futuristic racing game of all time; Redout is an absolutely essential purchase for anyone who’s grown up playing classics like F-Zero, Wipeout and Extreme-G.  This game does so many things right on so many levels it’s astounding, from the stunning visuals & sound design to the intelligent and ruthless AI.Make no mistake about it, Redout is FAST. Certainly its most divisive element, then, is just how floaty the vehicle handling is relative to both the windy-ness of the tracks and their relative visual similarity in each location.  This is a blessing in disguise, however, because Redout mandates track memorization and precise driving lines in a way I’ve rarely seen in similar racers.  The learning curve is steep, but taking the time to race the tracks over and over to learn their intricacies is absolutely addictive.The track design itself is brilliant, constantly temping players with wide straightaways to boost faster and faster through before throwing them into harrowing hairpins, loops and corkscrews.  Later courses completely throw reality out the window, serving up some of the wildest tracks seen this side of F-Zero GX, with massive jumps and only the smallest of margins for error. Redout’s single player campaign was for me worth the price of admission alone- over 100 career mode events cover a wide variety of game modes like time trials, tournament races, survival events and more.  It’s sure to take quite a few hours to finish off and does a great job of introducing the player to the game’s mechanics in the slower speed classes before letting them loose with the faster class 3 & 4 ships and the most difficult circuits. Redout’s multiplayer component currently consists of online racing, with local split-screen sadly not included at time of writing.  The online multiplayer works flawlessly and I’ve had a blast in online races, though it’s worth noting that during most hours of the day the online community seems quite dry (certainly not a fault of the game itself).  The game also includes online time-trial leaderboards, which is sure to create fun competition amongst the community.I only have a single true criticism of Redout which involves the game’s collision physics.  Colliding with fellow racers at high speeds has a frequent tendency to send your vehicle into a violent spin, occasionally resulting in your craft facing completely backwards.  It’s a mildly frustrating occurrence, especially online when only the smallest of missteps can be the difference between first place and missing the podium.  It certainly adds impetus and a certain amount of realism in needing to avoid crashes with other racers, but at the same time is a bit unforgiving and could welcome tweaking in a future update.I honestly cannot recommend Redout enough.  I’ve waited literally over a decade for a racer of this magnitude to be released and am absolutely blown away by what 34BigThings has been able to accomplish, from a small independent studio no less.  Hope to see you all on the racetrack!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

+ The sense of speed is absolutely insane! You go ridiculously fast in this game 500mph+ and there's boost!+ The gameplay is incredibly fun if you are a fan of fast-paced arcade racers. You fly a hovercraft with some sort of jet engine on the back while competiting in a large variety of races.+ Very unique and interesting controls. You actually have to use both analog sticks to successfully get around sharp corners. The right analog stick controls the pitch and shift of the craft. You sometimes have to lift the nose of the ship up so it doesn't grind against the floor of the track during sections that sharply rise up like a loopty loop. + Visually the game looks absolutely gorgeous. Every stage is uniquely themed with a lot of eye candy, fantastic lighting, and very detailed environments.+ Fantastic stage design with a large degree of verticality, it's almost like being on a roller coaster at times as the track turns from side to side, sometimes even going upside down or even flying as you go off massive jumps+ Great progression system. You warn cash after each race which you can use to buy upgrades, new ships, power-ups, etc. There are also special contracts that will reward you for doing specific challenges.+ Very challenging+ Great soundtrack~ This isn't neccessarily a downside, but the game can be frustratingly difficult to new players or people who are not good at racing games. There is no difficulty settings, so you have to improve as a player if you want to get far.			",2897,1025,99,264,346,21,391

												At first I wasn't completely sold on Redout the strandard modes were nice and the races fun at times but it lacked a spark.That all changed when I played the Boss race mode though. If anybody remember's and liked that old Hot Wheels movie (Hot Wheels World Race Highway 35) your in for a big surprise. The moment I played the boss mode it was like a wave of nostalgia washed over me it was like I was racing in the very races of that movie. The jumps, the teleports, the amazing tracks, the items all came together to create this nostalgic masterpiece. This game is without a doubt the BEST arcade racer of 2016!I've only just gotten to the level two cars and the difference between level 1 and 2 is CRAZY.  The amount of speed the level 2 cars have over level 1 is shocking to say the least. I'm having a hard time imagining what the level 3 car is going to handle like never mind the level 4 cars! PROS:-The adrenaline rush is intense with pulse pounding speed.-Amazing Graphics/Art style-Stunning race tracks with loops, jumps, teleports, etc. -Great stylized hover cars they each handle differently-Lots of game modes-Beautiful soundtrack (Still waiting for that ost guys)CONS:-Needs more tracks: What they have is gorgeous but there's only 4 areas; lava, desert, artic, jungle. We could use some underwater or space themed ones.-More cars: Again there's nothing wrong with what they have but more variety is always nice.-Multiplayer is a bit of a ghost town a times but since i never bother with multiplayer your milage may vary.Suggestions:-Could use a radio where we can play our own music while driving. Helps set the mood a bitI give the game a 9/10! Amazing detail and love were thrown into the making of this game.For those who don't know what hotwheels movie i was talking about:

												This review is from a VR perspective.It's not perfect. That said, I love this game. The feeling of speed is REAL! The first time you jump into the game, you'll feel your face melting off, and each time you get a new class of ship, that ""first time"" facemelting feeling comes back. As you can imagine, motion sickness CAN be a problem, but there are ways to get around this. Use the ""back bumper"" camera view to reduce your FOV. Also, adjust your Vive lense distance (the black plastic rings on the size) to be as far out as possible. Suggestions to developers:* PLEASE do not mount the loading screen to the display. The loading screen should be floating in 3D space like the rest of your menus.. just seeing this screen makes me crazy dizzy.* Disable the track ""flyover"" camera in VR. That section before you start a race and it's flying through the track, upsidedown, backwards, sideways? Yeah that's REALLY hard to deal with in VR and gives me a huge headache. If you don't want to disable it, please at least remove any lateral movement from it.tl;dr game is good get it, VR or no			",147,19,6,7,13,1,1

												This is the UE4 revolution at its most apparent. In nearly every way this is a perfect game--easy to play, difficult to master, beautiful levels, a constant rush of excitement and real speed. To address some other reviews, the AI is a challenging system, not an unfair one (I am a Wipeout fan prior to this and get gold medals approximately 2/3rds of the time). The instant adrenaline games, the true pick-up-and-play games have been neglected for too long. Finally we are able to start putting the fun back into gaming and it starts with Redout.Edit: After 10 hours I've nearly finished the career mode, that's pretty fantastic for a WipEout clone. I need more games like this.			",131,10,5,4,7,0,11

												At Last. A game that feels like Wipeout 2097. They have nailed the control scheme, the atmosphere, the tracks and even have done quite well with the soundtrack to. The speed is addictive. If you spent hours playing Wipeout 2097 back in the day, then this is what you have been waiting for.In VR it works well but as always, start with the lowest graphical settings to go for that killer frame rate then up it slowly to what your system can handle without any jarring. Personally I tried it on the lowest settings on my 3 year old PC and only the Oculus DK2 but it ran really well with no issues (make sure to up the max frame rate option in game). As a bonus i felt no sickness or nausea but so far VR has not added too much to the experience but it was nice to get some depth perception that may have helped at little in control. But of course you are not really looking around just facing forward to handle the speed. I found it better to play with the camera view showing just the nose of the craft to give you a point of reference in the VR space and look out for the loops though as I instinctively kept looking up so dont strain your neck with the adrenaline :) It also appears that your progress in VR mode will be separate from your progress in non-VR mode.

												This is definetly the F-Zero replacement I was loking for! Fun and chalanging to people who are experienced with games like this.Disclaimer:Just to clarify yes it is laking in F-Zero like lore and such and some may think it is because the deves didnt p[ut efort or annything but after talking to the about the game they did mention that the game was in development to long and neded to be shiped once complete so extra stuff i am sure was droped. But reguarding the feel of the raching it is very F-Zero and shows allot of potential in a sequal or sister game that could have a more F-zero like lore.			",130,18,3,15,11,1,25

Redout is the Wipeout successor you've (probably) been waiting for. I say 'probably', because there might be one or two things you find off-putting. Let's start with the elephant in the room: the difficulty. A hurdle that many people feel too high to overcome when starting out. Now the first four races have rubber-banding, but after those four events there's none of that anymore. The devs have already stated that they're adjusting this ""welcome gift"" to make it easier for players to get into the game.   Unlike Wipeout, Redout doesn't feature pick ups based on rng. Instead you choose one active and one passive power up before the race. This gives the game a bit of a strategic approach to races, since you can choose the tools that suit you best(you're able to boost by default.) And choosing the right powerups for your purpose has a significant impact on the outcome. It's able to change the result from ""wtf I don't even make bronze"" into ""You can't lock up the darkness"" mode. So I cannot recommend enough to experiment with powerups everytime you feel stuck.  Another thing that might seem off-putting is the weight of the ship. Particularly in relation to bumping into other ships. Getting a bump from a boosting ship from behind, might give you a spin that turns you 180° in the other direction. This is especially annoying since it breaks the flow of the game. A grave injustice to AG racing across all boards. However, the devs stated that they're working on that, so this point might very well be moot in the near future. One thing I personally find a bit weird is the upgrade system. There's only one upgrade per stat and per ship(four in total.) Meaning that after one click, you're done with upgrading it. In most cases, you buy all the upgrades the very moment you buy your ship, making the upgrade system a bit arbitrary for a feature. I feel like upgrade tiers (I-V for example) would've done the feature more justice. The way it feels now, is that there's an upgrade system, just so the game can advertise with an upgrade system. As a feature itself, it's fairly underwhelming. Now for the good things though, and here it gets pretty straightforward actually. Speed, handling, visuals, music, AI, content/race type variety, and especially track design(the volcano tracks are some of the most amazing tracks I've seen in a game, AG racing or not), they're all top notch.Racing at high speed through a sandstorm against the well made AI feels as great as you want it to feel. If there's ever been a love child between the feeling behind Star Wars' pod-racing and general AG racing, then this is it.In terms of race type variety Redout comes with the following:   Regular races Tournaments Pure events (no powerups) Time Trial Speed (time trial with a speed threshold. Every second you match or are above the target time is reduced from your lap time.) Score (gain points for position, boosts and perfect laps.) Last Man Standing (last place gets eliminated each round) Arena Race (no respawns, last one alive or first place wins) Instagib (increased damage and no respawn) Survival (race until you explode. Pass checkpoints for score but beware of the mines on the race track.) Boss (multiple tracks tacked together by teleporters. Yes, it's as neat as it sounds!) Redout isn't a Wipeout clone, and does not want to be. The ship handling is fairly different, there's no airbrake but rather floaty strafing/drifting and the speed starts out much higher than in Wipeout. Redout is aiming to make its entry as a top grade AG racer, and as far as I'm concerned, the devs succeeded. With Wipeout off the grid since Sony closed its studio, 34Bigthings are in a position to corner the AG racing market with a new genre staple. And if this is any indication of what they're capable of, then I can only hope that Redout isn't a one time endeavor for them.			",81,19,2,15,7,1,12

												I remember playing F-Zero GX on the gamecube years ago. It was a great, extremely-fast paced racer that had numerous tracks, a great soundtrack, and lots of replayability. Unfortunately, Nintendo seems to have left F-Zero on the shelf in an undisclosed basement and we have not seen much hyperspeed hovercar racers in a long time, let alone on the PC platform.Suddenly, I heard about this game 1 DAY before it launched, claiming to be a ""tribute"" to games like F-Zero. Having played it for several hours, I can say it's a solid tribute, though not without a few cracks.Let me get my criticisms out of the way first:  The difficulty of this game is all over the place. Most of the time, I had no issues getting gold  or platinum  on my first attempts. Sometimes, the events were challenging, but still doable. However, there are a few events that are ridiculously hard, especially the first pure race that you are allowed to do. I don't mind a hard challenge, but you shouldn't kick a newbie's teeth in when...  There is no tutorial to explain some of the mechanics. I know the loading screen tips told me to pitch up to avoid scraping on the ground, which would lower my speed, but I don't know why I should avoid blackouts or redouts or if there is some trick to improve my pure racing performance. I also didn't know I could upgrade my vehicle until I saw someone's gameplay video. Basically, a little hand holding for new players would be much appreciated.  The AI seems a little finicky. Some tracks, it manages to perform well to be really difficult to pass (hence the issue with pure races), but on other tracks, it slows down heavily at certain bends that makes it way too easy to stay in front.However, despite these issues, I'm willing to overlook it as the rest of the game is really well designed.  The game has a really cool sci-fi look, almost like a simulation.  The controls are great and feel similar to F-Zero (with a few tricks of its own).  The SPEED is aaaaaaaaaAAAAAaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaawesome!  Really great track designs, with some having really cool moments.  Excellent dynamic soundtrack.I hope the developers can continue to work on this game, as I would love to see it just tweaked a bit more to become even better. It's not perfect, but it's probably the closest we'll get to an F-Zero game on the PC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Description:It is basically the aesthetics and verticality of Wipeout mixed with the strafe from the first F-Zero and the speed from I don't know a game that feels even remotely this fast. If you like any futuristic racing game you should definitely buy this.Three upsides:Feels incredibly fastDoesn't hold your handVery vertical track designThree downsides:More or less requires a controller because you want a second stick to be able to have analogue controls for pitch, yaw, strafe and accelerate. It supports keyboard/mouse controls, just saying that you will be considerably better off with a gamepad.Vertical bends are often poorly telegraphedA few events combine multiple tracks into one via teleport gates. You can not see the next part of the track until you get teleported, which often leads to you grinding the wall of a bend the first time around. It's tough to learn what is coming because those events tend to have extremely long lap times (three minutes and more). ",166,30,3,14,11,2,9

												Put F-Zero, Megarace, Wipeout and five tabs of acid in a blender and you have Redout. The music, the atmosphere, the vehicles and the speed are all very well done and I played for 3 hours straight before I had to stop to lower my pulse. This is what a futuristic racing game should be. This is going to be a hit.			",479,96,36,70,68,1,58

Graphics are colorful and up to par with modern games.The soundtrack suits the game. You like speed and racing?Try this. It's one hell of a blast..  Playing this on a 5820k @ 4.5 Ghz with a 980ti on a 1440p 144hz monitor. And well..I'm not maxing out at 144hz,so it's quite taxing on full details.			",61,23,6,5,22,1,12

												This is one of the best racing games I played in the last few years, although it has somewhat little content, you always want to improve your record time and keep getting better.+ nice graphics+ good performance+ tuning is simple and makes an actual difference+ good music+ really good track design+ challenging gamemodes and KI+ the sensation for speed is awsome+ frustration kept to a minimum, I never felt demotivated while playing, even when I get messed up by the KI drivers / drive really bado content is not really huge, replayability makes up for ito some more statistics would be nice- I never found any online games (can't really blame the game, though)- the interface is a little messy- inconsistent difficulty (sometimes I give my best and end up last, sometimes I drive sloppy af and get first place)In my opinion it is worth the price, at least when you are into these kind of games (F-Zero, WipeOut, etc.).If not, wait for a sale, pick it up and try it, it does it's thing really well.

												You like racing games like F-Zero, Whipeout etc. ?Get it.You like going fast?Get it.You like active online gaming?Nah.This game is great. The start might be rough since you have to steer and shift the ships at the same time but once you get used to it, you´ll enjoy it.The music might be repetitive if you have to repeat courses several times (You just want the gold medal) but still, the music´s real good. (In case you don´t like it you can still use your own music.)Graphics looks real good, even on Medium settings. I would compare it to the F-Zero GX graphics since they´re kinda similar.Last but not least is the online gameplay which I couldn´t play once since this game has a daily playerbase of ~10 people. Try to ignore it, play the Carrer and enjoy it. It´s not all about online gameplay :)tl;drIt´s hella lot of fun. Grab it if you can.			",87,12,7,8,4,0,4

												""Race faster than ever"". I think the devs have the right to claim that their game is indeed the fastest AG racing game.The graphics are blocky"" (it's a new type of graphics used in many games I just don't know the term) but they're very well made. The tracks are awesome. The music is better than the usual soundtrack such games include. The controls (gamepad) are very good and actually there are three different types of controls you can choose from which is awesome because you can find what fits you more.During the race you won't be able to pickup a weapon but there's an energy bar that you can use to either boost your speed or to use the ""add-on"" you've chosen before the race. There are also the usual boost ""places"".In the career mode you earn money which you use to upgrade your ship, to buy the next class ships, to buy add-ons and upgrade them. By choosing the right add-ons and upgrating them, I think the difficulty curve is just right.I didn't find anything bad in this game really. In the first place I wanted it to include weapons, which I still think would be a nice addition but this is not something bad about the game. Redout is great even without the Wipeout weapons.Race faster than ever!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												THIS. GAME. IS. AMAZING. it seems easy from videos, and some  of the class 1 races are at first but thats not even the start. first, the right analog stick function: IF YOU DONT FEEL FULLY IMMERSED WHEN YOU HAVE TO TILT BOTH DAMN STICKS TO MAKE A TURN AT 500+ MPH, ♥♥♥♥ YOU DUDE.that ♥♥♥♥ had my eyes so stuck to the screen to make sure i hit every turn perfectly!! its so good!!! it makes the challenge feel real. and you truly feel a difference in ships anti gravity grip settings and speed and acceleration. they truly feel like hover CARS!! sure you my hit the walls alot but if you work and focus, you can  be a very driver redout driver. its not hard. but it really does requires a true racers focus. they did PERFECTLY. It feels like hover forza lolsecond; the AI. OOOOOOO THE ♥♥♥♥ WEEEEEE. those AIs are some feisty sum♥♥♥♥♥s, but they make your heart race like now other.. seriously, i did a race five times back to  back and the last time i was in  GT Lunace up against a Hussar and the dude made my ♥♥♥♥in hands shake. BUT I ♥♥♥♥ING BEAT HIM  AFTER 5 TIMES!!!!! AND THE FEELING WAS LIKE WINNING THE DAMN LOTTO!!! and  that was just one of the HARDER class 1 races i thinkthird: NO RACE NAV: now tbh, i was kinda disgruntled with this but  then i l began to appreciate it because i start realizing the nav is all in the track. you just have to put on your racers docus and PAY ATTENTION. dont be afraid to break in turns, just make sure you lean with everytihng you got and use boost to come out.

A great Wipeout-inspired racing title with optional VR modes!I gotta say, ""I love this game so much right now.""  Redout is providing me some of the most beautiful visuals I could ask for from a racing game, and its controls are pretty simplified and user-friendly.  The UI is both easy to read and easy to navigate. (Some players may find the power-ups menu slightly confusing, but it's really not bad.)  The sense of speed with this game is impressive.  The time attack mode is challenging and worth your time, but yes, there's a mode with AI racers.  I've played a little of the multiplayer and it's leaps and bounds better than the AI in single-player, so much so that I never stand a chance at winning.Vive support is still limited but no longer buggy!I bought this game for $26.24 during the Black Friday sale after eyeing it for about a month as a potential VR racing game.  Unfortunately, this was not yet a good racing game for the HTC Vive when I bought it... at least not for me!  I managed to get into the first race in SteamVR mode, but it wasn't rendering the UI at all before or after the race.  At the time, the game wouldn't even work right with Steam's overlay.  That said, it's fixed with the 1.1.0 patch, and VR is finally working well enough to enjoy it.  The game doesn't look quite as finely polished in VR, and it's a heck of a lot harder to play in VR, but it works well after the patch, and I bought the game primarily for the VR experience initially.  I'm a little disappointed with the cockpit model, but there's a no cockpit, no ship camera mode that works very well if you can get past the motion sickness aspect of it.  The game does not support the Vive controllers but for some reason supports Razer Chroma... a funny choice, that was.  Anyway, an Xbox 360 controller works well for this game.Razer Chroma lighting support is cool!Redout is the first game I've seen to incorporate Razer lighting effects.  It's a cool feature, but it doesn't seem to follow the game's music's pace very well.  When the music is fast-paced, the lights are a steady, somewhat slow speed, so it's not quite as awesome as it could be.  The keyboard controls are also not the optimal way to play the game.  You'll want to play this game with dual joysticks.  That said, Redout inspired me (partially) to get my Razer products, and the Chroma keyboard effects are magnificent.  If you're thinking about such a purchase, it's worth every penny.Tading cards and tradable game items!Yeah, almost everything has trading cards nowadays, but Redout has in-game usable items which can be traded on the Steam marketplace.  This is actually a rare thing even though Team Fortress 2 has been doing it for a long time.  If you get Redout, be sure to recoup some of the cost by selling the in-game items, because right now, those items have value.Overall, this game is well worth the $26 I spent on it, and the VR features are a nice bonus, even if I never really want to use them.  You will have to have a powerful rig to truly enjoy its spectacular visuals in VR, but it'll run fairly well on a modest gaming rig without VR.  Tuning the graphical options is fairly easy and can result in nicer performance for low end rigs and VR purposes.			",571,115,13,72,58,7,60

												As a huge Wipeout and F-Zero fan, this game definitely satisfies me. The controls feel great, the tracks and visuals otherwise are lovely, and it provides a decent challenge.For VR nerds: Having been playing with a Vive, it's a little disappointing that there's no cockpit view yet, but the developers have stated that it's a work in progress (no ETA provided though). It still makes for a great experience, though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""To Infinity and Beyond""I hope you're wearing your time travelling pants because this review starts in the past.Come back with me, if you will, to a time when movie-goers were watching a young Angelina Jolie in ""Hackers"", party-goers were dancing the Macarena and school-goers were all busy playing with their Pogs.As Coolio would tell you, the year we're talking about is the Gangsters Paradise that was 1995.""Houston We Have A Problem""Whilst the world was rooting for Ross and Rachel to get together and OJ Simpson to get what he deserved, I had my own problems.I'd said goodbye to Windows 3.1 and embraced the revolution that was Windows 95 but I was still being tempted away from PC gaming by something called a PlayStation.It was shiny and new and I really, really wanted one...The problem was that I'd already spent all my money on Pogs so just like Apollo 13, I had a problem.""I'm Broke but I'm Happy""Thankfully 1995 saw the birth of another shiny new thing called EBay.It was a sign, fate wanted me to sell my earthly possessions and buy the new console.... and who am I to argue with fate.So it was with a Braveheart that I said goodbye to my Pog collection and hello my shiny new PlayStation. Having taken the plunge into the world of the PS1 (although we just called it a PS back then)  I took Alanis Morissettes advice, put ""one hand in my pocket"" and bought a game called Wipeout.The Quick and The DeadWipeout was a anti gravity racer which saw you flying your.... erm.... (I don't know what it was... a ship? a hover-car? a pod-racer?.... ) Anyway you flew your ""thing"" around several different tracks at crazily fast speeds whilst trying not to bounce off the walls.You'd zoom over speed boosts, pick up weapons and try to blast your opponents out of the way.You had to be alert too because whilst you were trying to line up a shot on the racer in front, you can be sure that the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on your tail was trying to do exactly the same thing to you.It was an adrenaline fuelled rush and a huge amount of fun.You are not AloneIn the years that followed Wipeout spawned a sequel and there were other similar titles, POD, F-Zero, Rollcage etc. but it's still that first Wipeout title which springs to my mind when I hear the words ""Anti-Grav Racer"" and I've been hearing those words again recently in reference to a new game developed by 34BigThings. That game is Redout.You Oughta KnowRedout is, as you might have guessed from my pre-amble, an anti-grav racer and at the risk of spoiling the rest of this review, it's a very good one.If you've played Wipeout or any of the other antrigrav games out there then you'll know what to expect with Redout.First you'll select an AG ship.Want to drift stylishly around the bends or grip tightly to the track?Are you looking for something with a high top speed or maybe faster acceleration?There are several options available to suit your flying style.So unlike OJ Simpsons gloves, you'll have no problem finding the right fit.Lets GrooveNext you can choose to either fly a quick race (which does exactly what it says on the tin)  or you can play through the career mode.The career campaign will take you through over 100 events as you fly for your chosen racing team (there are six to choose from).Winning these events will reward you not only with medals but more importantly with experience and money which you can use to upgrade you ship.You can earn even more money and XP by taking and completing contracts, these come with certain requirements like complete track X using ship type Y, etc. and can be quite lucrative.The Usual SuspectsThe upgrade system is what you would expect from this type of game, with options to increase your acceleration, handling, top speed etc. Anything that can help you in a race is a good thing, the tracks can be quite tricky, Redout is by no means an easy game to master.Along with a host of mechanical ship upgrades there are also passive and active upgrade slots on your craft, you'll unlock various abilities as you play which you can switch around before each race to give you an additional edge.The events themselves are broken down into seven different categories, from score based endurance tests and arena challenges to traditional races, all of which take place on the 25+ tracks Redout offers.The tracks are well designed with plenty of variation from desert plains to frozen ice sheets, all offering their own unique challenges. As I said earlier, Redout is not an easy game.Don't Stop (Wiggle Wiggle)Your first time around any new track will likely see you bouncing off the ground and scraping around the bends, this doesn't just slow you down but can also damage and destroy your ship.Seeing your health bar drop down into the red as you scrape around the last bend of a race really adds to the tension, especially if you're in with a shot of actually winning.But if like R. Kelly, you ""don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind"", you can always upgrade your ship with better endurance to your ""dogems racing style"" or invest in some repair drones to keep you ""on track"".Beautiful in My EyesRedout is a good looking game with some spectacular lighting effects thanks to the Unreal 4 engine, however you're unlikely to really appreciate these graphical niceties as you tear around the tracks. It's a well optimised game which starts out fast and quickly moves onto eye-bleedingly-fast as you progress.FantasyThere is a background story to Redout, something to do with a post apocalyptic Earth, melted icecaps and humans that live on the moon who come back to the nest for a little AG racing fun.It's as flimsy as an OJ Alibi, It doesn't really matter and it doesn't get in the way, this is a racing game, your real story is ""win the race"" and that's enough motivation for me.Toy StoryFor those of you lucky enough to have access to a VR headset to strap on your face, Redout also works perfectly well in VR mode.I've played it on the Rift and whilst the game is already blisteringly fast on a monitor, the experience feels even faster in virtual reality and also brings the additional bonus of real life vomiting if you turn your head to the left or right whilst racing.In all seriousness, VR does add a lot to the immersion and whilst I'm lucky enough to have the option to play in VR, I still prefer to play Redout as an ""Old school"" monitor based racer,  but those less inclined to motion sickness who want to get some use out of their Rift or Vive whilst playing a ""real"" game and not a dressed up tech demo could do a lot worse than Redout in VR mode.Crimson TideRedout is an insanely fast anti-grav experience with impressive visuals and solid controls, if you're looking for a challenging arcade racer and are willing to put the time in to learn the twists and turns of each track then there's really only one contemporary option and that's Redout!Like the review and want to see more?

												At the time of this review, I'm about 25% into career mode.     So far, this game is on par with Wipeout and it kicks things up a couple notches in terms of speed and crazy tracks. Handling is a bit more like F-Zero, and can take a good deal of practice to get used to. I'm having a lot of fun playing this one and feel that its worth the price. Pros:- In-depth Career mode. 4 race classes, ship upgrades.Current Best Speed is 1,410mph. Yes, you read that right: MPH. You'll see those speeds on Class 2.- Passive and Active ""Weapon"" perks which are also upgradeable- Trippy looking race tracks with jumps and boost pads. - Fitting OST- Cool looking ships, some unique designs.Cons:- FPS drops on some tracks, usually near portals.- AI is a bit strange, tough some races and easy others, unpredictable driving patterns. - Has a higher learning curve then some games, but you do earn money if you lose. - Older computers will not be able to run this. I'm running it on low settings with 60% resolution.Things that would make this game epic:- Track Builder. So many games lack this feature, and i think having the ability to create, share and race yours and tracks others have created could be epic. - Custom OST - Allow us to race to our own music if we choose to.At its current state i would give this game a 7.5/10. Let the positive history of all the reviewers before me speak for themselves. I'd love to see what else devs include for the game in the future.			",101,87,17,28,3,0,6

												Sorta rhymes with Wipeout, looks like Wipeout, sounds like Wipeout, feels like Wipeout, plays like Wipeout.This is an eager love letter to the Wipeout games, and it pulls it off. This is the Wipeout VR we were never going to get.If you wistfully remember pouring countless hours into Mega Mall, or pinning Icaras and Feisar posters on your wall, or wanting to work for The Design Republic... this is your game. Do it.Especially with a Vive.			",326,45,12,42,37,1,53

												TL;DR: The game is great, git gud and come play :D |9.1/10 overall|(Also, this is currently based mostly off career mode, havent played online aside from with friends)I don't review often, but after reading the literal garbage review of this game on PC Gamer (still unsure on that decision in the first place) I decided I should try and at least put some positivity back into this game to that crap being served up by those bribe-♥♥♥♥♥s at PCG.This game is fun, like serious fun. Best recommendation I can give, convince one or more of your friends to try it out with you and just have fun exploring the beautiful worlds, listening to some tasty jams, and tearing through whichever beautiful track you chose at approx. 1000 km/h. More on that:Gameplay: (A-) So you jump into game and woosh, R2 (or RT or w/e it is on keyboard controls) and you're flying down the track in your brand new Class I car. You're already going crazyballs fast, and then you think ""Oh ♥♥♥♥...if this is a Class I car, how crazy fast is this gonna get?"" Oh it's gonna get really fast, you press another button and fwoosh you found your turbo boost buttonand suddenly you're going about 200 faster than you were about an instant ago. This game is FUN to learn and get better at.Honest simple answers, the controls aren't as tight as they are in some racing games, but for all the boohoos about tight controls HEY.......shh. You're barreling up, down, left, right and every other damn way the game can manage on a hovercar...that drifts...at stupid breakneck speeds. Yeah, there might be some wobble. It's k, the chance you might go offcourse to stab the nose of the vehicle into the side of some poor, undeserving mountain is half the fun.Between upgrades, vehicle choice, powerups (both passive and active), dual stick controls, a bunch of different courses, brifting and boosting, there is a surprising amount of depth to this game's mechanics.Music: (B) The music of this game gets a solid mark, but falls just a bit short...lemme explain. The music in this game, for the most part and to my knowledge and opinion, does its job. And the fact that I have to phrase it like that hurts a bit, but it is on the nose. The music is high energy electronic, that pulses and drops and feels perfect when it lines up with a loop or a huge boost or a huge jump. It doesn't get annoying too fast and thanks to the intense visual portion of the game, the but that the music falls short for the gameplay is overwritten by the strict attention you have to pay to the track.TL;DR: Not bad at all, but nothing stellar.Career Mode: (A) It doesn't beat you over the head by making you run the same track over and over, you don't have to grind for decades to get in-game money, in fact your money is even buffered by career events that award somewhere between 8-50k in-game (lowest and highest I've seen). Has some super fun ""BOSS"" tracks (Don't look em up, save the fun <3) that will make you say ""woah"" out loud, even if it's just under your breath or whatever. Pretty much all my game time has been in career mode, and more hours are gonna get dumped there. Moral of the story: A career mode that showcases everything the game has to offer in a raw, no hand-holdy way. Oh and to comment on it as most have, yes the AI in this game can be downright brutal, but it isn't fun if you win every time, eh?Other Notes: FREAKING PATCH NOTES. Seriously, this came as a surprise, but hey, not too shabby to have a game get mostly BALANCE patching, with a couple of bugfixes of course, just one week after launch. Plus the peeps at 34BT seem to have a pretty decent correspondence with the community. Not stellar, but the fans gotta reach out too. :3Plus, while the phrase seems to mean less and less every day, this is a smaller developer, trying to bring us a fresh, fun game that, obviously, a lot of people sorely missed. I know I did.Overall, this game is a beautiful homage to a lot of hyper-racing games of old, it's fast, it's fun and it's waiting for you to grab yourself a copy and start breaking some speed records. I'd give the game a solid 9.1/10 overall.And for anyone who read any (or heaven help you all) of this, hope it helped, thanks kindly, and much love. <3 -FmD			",186,31,2,38,3,0,10

												Redout is an anti-gravity racing game that claims to be a tribute to F-Zero and WipeOut, and it has largely delivered.The game communicates the thrill of racing very well; you don't really need big numbers on the HUD to know you are going fast when you can feel the speed by the vibrations of the ship and the scenery blurring into the background. Controls are tight but can be a challenge to handle on more complex corners (pitching and strafing). Soundtrack adds to the atmosphere and apparently adapts to the speed (haven't noticed this yet).The AI in Career Mode is challenging to say the least. They are very aggresive and rarely commit mistakes. They also think every race is a demolition derby as they crash into each other and me frequently. This often causes me to suffer a speed penalty and drop to last. I'm not sure if this is the intended behaviour but I believe it could be toned down a bit.The control scheme supports both keyboard and gamepad, but none of them are rebindable which is unfortunate. I use the keyboard and the WASD keys are used for accelerating and turning while the arrow keys are used for pitching and strafing. The boost button is bound to Left Shift which can get quite painful if using the pinky. I am also used to steering with the arrow keys so getting used to the Redout controls was a challenge in itself as well.Overall Redout is a great game that deserves more attention, even disregarding its niche. The mechanics are well designed and the gameplay really conveys the sense of speed, which is important in a racing game. I am hopeful the developers will address the issues in a timely manner (especially the rebinding) as they do appear in the forums fairly often.			",249,92,14,24,26,1,28

												As a big fan of AG racing games (Fzero X my love), I was very enthusiastic when I saw that release on steam, and I haven't been disappointed. The game has very good graphics and the speed sensation is awesome. The tracks designs are inspired and the different ships controls feel great. At first, the game can seem really hard, your first races aren't gonna make you pleased, but if you persist you'll find a very rewarding progression.I love it, the career mode is fun and the online mode is a great plus. That first time when I unlocked a platinum medal made me so excited, feeling my own skill improved.A must have for any arcade racing lover.			",772,171,49,41,45,9,73

												This is absolutely flawless. To my knowledge, this is the only time a game has exceeded it's ""spiritual ancestor""; Wipeout was a fantastic game, but is clearly beaten by this awesome experience. Track design is flawless and wonderful. Ship design is solid, music is passable (though lacking some of the heady heights of wipeout '97), but the environments, depth of gameplay and tracks make for a simply unbeaten game. Heck, even the game modes are incredible - Boss mode in particular. 10/10 would buy again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game melted my face and forced me to eat it!On a serious note, it's fantastic; smooth frame rates and a nice feeling while going round the track. You are not ground to a halt if you hit the side, but the slow down will cost you valuable time. This game does not just hand over golds like a teacher in a school for the underprivaledged, nope it makes you work for them. The career mode feels a little basic but there is a lot to it; time trials, races, lvl progression, ship and upgrade unlocks. The graphics are amazing in places but functional in others (the ships themselves are low on detail but they have a style to them that i like), and the sparks and effects just heighten a great sense of speed and flow through the race... well until you smash into a building on the first jump (yup I did that).The Multiplayer works and I had 4 races with no problems; although I think it's P2P as I lost the host after 4 games. That said, it worked smoothly (even if I raced badly XD ) and was a blast. At the time of writing there were not many players, but hey its day one on a game that hasn't been hyped (but it should be, it is a solid title).To sum up, if you like games like Wipeout, Extreme G or F-Zero then you will probably like it; I know I do.

												Great skill based hover racing game. The more time you put in, the more you get out of it. Getting a hang of the controls feels extremely rewarding. Plenty of Pros and most of the Cons are subjective/could be fixed with an expansion or patch.Pros:-Tight responsive controls-Well designed tracks with plenty of verticality-High skill ceiling-Around 20 different tracks-Excellent sound design responds to your gameplay-Plenty of different vehicles and classesCons:-Few music tracks, becomes repetitive-4 track themes. Could be expanded for more variety-Only 3 control schemes, no custom key bindings-Lack of balanced powerups. You will end up only using 4 or 5 of the total 10 (12?) options-Limited vehicle customization. Just pre-set color schemes. There are a good number of these, but something like custom colors, or custom logos would be really niceOnce again, very good game, the Pros definitely outweigh the Cons, and I look forward to the dev's continued work on this game, especially if it can address some of the Cons.

												This is easily the closest any racing game I've played has ever come to matching the fun of F-Zero GX.I haven't tried playing with a keyboard, but at least for a controller there are a handful of control schemes to pick your favorite of. The default works well once you're used to it (dual-stick controls are new to me for a game like this), but you can also swap to a more ""classic"" A-To-Go scheme if you're more familiar with F-Zero on consoles.Graphics are fantastic. Each track looks stunning. Music goes well with the tracks (definitely recommend the OST).Difficulty seems just right. There's a bit of focus on picking the right passive/active powerups, or ship, for the right track, which might rub some people the wrong way (I know many people who always played the same machine in F-Zero), but by the same mechanic, you have more room to customize your machine than just ""Do I want speed or acceleration?""Career mode is paced nicely for learning the tracks and winning the races. Multiplayer with friends is fun, but it's the career mode where the game shines brightest.			",182,23,1,36,14,1,41

												WipeOut...the very reason I first bought a playstation nearly 20 years ago. Played it to death and loved it. It was a very hard learning curve and Redout is just as unforgiving. The game is fast, very fast and on a GTX1070 it runs like a dream. I've only had a few races and just started the career mode but my initial impression is that I will be playing this to the end.

												I trace back to F-Zero for the SNES, to the wonderful Wipeout 2097 that stunned the ♥♥♥♥ out of me, and its big brother on the N64. Although then came Extreme-G for the N64 as well, and I was madly addicted to that game as well (although not a AG game, its extremely fast paced racing and loopy insane tracks was no less different). Then trackmania slowly came in to my collecting of insane racing, and I cannot express how much time and love I've had for that series. It was then nice to see Wipeout HD Fury come for the PS3 as well. My bloody point is that it's truly nice to see an AG game return, and just take all the elements from all these games, and just refine it so nicely. The tracks are just so nicely layed out, the pacing is fast as you'd expect, and the variety of vehicles and upgrades are a nice addition. The visuals is another top notch, but Unreal Engine 4 never fails to disappoint (I just wish I can disable some of those post-processing effects).It's a wonderful game, but challenging as well. You'll be frustrated, no doubt. These games are just pure fun and rageful. I am hoping for more content (DLC even) for this game, and hopefully the patches can iron the game out a little more. But right now, it's a polished crazy fun AG game, and worth your time investment if you are a fan of any of those games mentioned up there. I also hope that the AI is ironed out a bit, as they are insanely difficult in one front, and insanely easy on the other front. Maybe add some kind of easy>norma>hard>nightmare thing, you know? Now buy it and go have fun.Toots.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Redout is a futuristic anti-gravity racing game, very much inspired by games like F-Zero and Wipeout. For those who may not have played a similar game, you race in ships that hover just above the ground on tracks that defy gravity with loops and huge jumps. Since you have no contact with the ground, the physics are very different to regular racing games and require you to think differently as you approach different parts of the track. Each ship can 'strafe' left or right, which allows you to very noticably change the angle of your ship mid-corner. Learning to use this is crucial and does take a bit of time to adjust to, particularly if you're more used to the airbrake system used in F-Zero and Wipeout. You can also adjust the pitch of your craft's nose, which leads me onto the title of the game. A 'Redout' occurs when too much blood rushes to the brain from negative G-Force. In the game this means that when you suffer negative G-Force you need to adjust the angle of your nose to prevent a redout, which makes the entire screen turn red and makes it difficult to see. You can also blackout through positive G-Force.There are several game modes. Race (does what you think), Time Trials, Last Man Standing (the last place ship on each lap is eliminated), Survival (your ship health drains over time) and Boss (which is a series of tracks chained together through teleporters). There are also 'Pure' races where no powerups are allowed. I should point out now that Redout is HARD. Particularly in the first few races it really feels like the AI rubberband but I've seen arguments for both sides on this. You need to be on the top of your game to even place on the podium until you've earned enough for ship upgrades.Visually the game is beautiful. Even on lower settings it looks amazing and the sense of speed when you're racing is the best of any racing game I've played. The interface in menus is a bit clunky but its a minor complaint. The soundtrack is a bit of a mixed bag but mostly adrenaline-pumping which suits this genre of game perfectly.Complaints are few and far between but there are some areas I'd like to see improved. The options menu is incredibly sparse (there is no option for Window mode in-game and you can't manually rebind controls). The difficulty is going to put off some people, and I genuinely think that the first few races need the AI nerfing as it's really punishing for newer players. It would also be nice for a wider variety of tracks and ships. There are a good amount of tracks but only 4 locations so the scenery gets old pretty fast. Likewise there are a few different teams and each team has a few ships but within a team all the ships look very similar, as opposed to something like F-Zero.Overall though I'm a massive fan of Redout. If you even slightly liked F-Zero or Wipeout you will probably love this. Get past the difficulty curve and it's incredibly rewarding. Between this and BallisticNG the anti-gravity racing scene has really come into its own again.			",47,5,14,10,6,0,8

												Anyone that is a fan of the futuristic racing genre needs to buy Redout ASAP. I didn't care so much for FAST Racing Neo on Wii U so I was hesitant to dip my toes on another indie game in the beloved genre, but the demo and a Steam sale made me give it a try. I am glad I did.Redout is aiming high when it says it's trying to honor Wipeout, F-Zero, and other games that define the genre. You can see the influence of these games and others through the different ship manufacturers. Thankfully, the tribute is more the superficial, because this game delivers a pure racing experience. It ticks all the boxes it needs to (asethetics, lore, velocity) but more importantly it manages to be something new and unique.The best way to describe the gameplay is that it is a twin-stick racer. Like the twin-stick shooter, using and mastering the two joysticks of a modern controller is absolutely necessary to do well in this game. (An X360 or equivalent gamepad is pretty much required to play well.) Like in the Wipeout series, you can control the pitch (nose angle) of your hovercraft. However, the circuits in Redout take the vertical aspect of track design to absurdity. You will be turning up and down just as much as you will be turning left and right, and the game's control setup respects this.It's preferable that you learn the default control scheme, where you steer on the left stick and control pitch and strafe on the right stick. (Wipeout-style controls are available, but I wouldn't recommend them. Also, you can't customize anything unless you use the Steam client's controller config menus.) There's a learning curve with the strafe controls, which aren't like airbrakes. After you begin to understand how strafe can be used with, against, or without steering inputs, it offers fine-control abilities unlike any other game I've played.There's great satisfaction when navigating a complex set of horizontal and vertical turns without slamming into the walls. That's not to say you will ever get good enough to not graze/hit walls constantly. Shield management and collision avoidance is part of the game. This can be frustrating, as well as can the disoriating blackout/redout effects when you fail to pitch on extreme vertical changes. However, it makes it all the better when you finally discover the right timing of turn, pitch, throttle and strafe to make it through a hard section. It feels like you're really piloting a true hovercraft.The main attraction of Redout is the raw sense of speed it offers, and critically, the stable 60+ framerate it maintains under all circumstances. The only other 60+ game like this I've played that lets you go unlimitedly fast without a performance drop was F-Zero GX on the GameCube, and that game was bloody impressive. Redout is five times more impressive than that. The visual sensations of speed and direction change in this game can get so overwhelming, turning down/off the motion blur in the options is a must in the higher speed classes. There can be a game where too fast is too much, and Redout is that game. (That's a good thing.)My chief complaint about Redout is the (current) lack of multiplayer options. There's no local multiplayer. There is online multiplayer, but with the relatively small playerbase finding players when you want is impossible. Being an indie title, I have some hope that the upcoming console releases (PS4/XB1/Switch) will enable PC crossplay of some kind to help boost the online population for everyone. I would also caution how tracks don't always standout from the background environment, which makes reading ahead difficult until you can half-memorize the tracks. (You will never completely memorize them.)My bottom line: If you want something new in the racing genre, Redout is for real.			",59,11,6,4,7,0,6

It's challenging, won't hold your hand any more than is sensible, and has tight controls. So when you lose, you have no one but yourself to blame.

												This is the coolest, fastest racing game I've played in a long time. I've played F-Zero GX in the past but that game was more about twitch reflexes while this is more about learning to control the different ships to properly make turns without losing too much speed.However, I have to be honest here: the price of $38.69 is way too much given that you can get many other games to the same degree of polish as this for much less. I feel the price is the sole reason this game does not have a big playerbase. I had to go through hoops to find people to play online with. Many of my friends are interested in this game but do not want to purchase due to the price.It was a very nice treat to be given 5 new tracks in a new environment, which essentially gave us 25% more game, but unless there are 40 tracks total I feel this game deserves a nice price cut to give it more exposure, and give us more players to play with.

												So, this one time, a guy on my Facebook said that his game was finally released. Being sceptic, I assumed it was going to be another eight-bit graphic indie rush job. Yeah- no. It was Redout. A fully fleshed out Zero-G racer. Shut up and take my money.Redout is a three dimensional racing game. You take control of a futuristic pseudo space car which magnetically sticks to an aggressively winding and looping track and try to be the best pilot at roughly 800km/h. Not only do you take corners and bends, but you also need to mind your angle when taking slopes. It’s a very involving and definitely a hands-on game. Very engaging; not for the faint of heart.When you first try the game you’ll quickly become acquainted with the wall and your best friend the respawn prompt. Your ship has a durability bar, and hitting the wall, ground or other racers will quickly drain it. Learning to fly this machine is key and until I had read a guide on Steam on how to corner I was grinding my ship into scrap at every other corner. The key is to understand the strafing mechanic. You can adjust your alignment to the track ever so slightly, but in the corners you can use it  curve round the apex neatly and initiate a little drift for effect or you can correct your exit and make a swift boost onto the straight. Practice makes perfect and flying a race without ever touching the walls might be worthy of its own exhibition in the Louvre. The ships come in four classes, from fast to “my face has come off”. Every ship controls slightly differently and at times you’ll find use for even the most skewed vessel. Each ship looks simple on level one, but become much more alien and ornate on every level. Although they look like tricked out polygons, you’ll be too busy going fast to care. The music is on the mark. Satisfyingly pulse pounding and energising. Some tracks stick with you, however, the selection is limited. The tracks are the true stars here. With five different environments and with about four different tracks on each, you’ll quickly become familiar with many twists and turns. Hairpins and sudden drops are part of the game. Insane airtime and submarine sections are also par for the course. There is as much up and down as there is left and right. Learning the tracks is immensely rewarding because the AI is terrible at big hairpins, so knowing when to pounce is the key to winning races. Breaking up the monotony are a slew of race types. From regular races to time attacks, as well as elimination, speed limit runs and super races that connect all tracks from one environment into one super race. Making your way through career will take a pretty long time. You’ll be rewarded for every medal and you will keep going to better yourself after buying a power-up that just made all the difference. However, afterward I found very little else to do because online appears to be pretty dead. I only found one other player and he wasn’t even on my level. In short, Redout is blindingly fast, unforgiving, long, rewarding and fun to play. However, the learning curve can be a big turn-off of many and linking your available machines to your career process might be hindering online. However, the sheer exhilaration and tight experience make it very worthwhile.			",192,21,8,22,19,2,33

												If you liked the racing model of Wipeout XL, you'll enjoy Redout. It nails the same feeling of trying to nail that Perfect Lap, the dream where your path around the track would resemble a lovely Bézier curve. You'll feel at one with your ship as it slides around curves and every bump against a wall feels like it could have been avoided had you taken the last turn a little tighter, or looser, or faster, etc. Basically, it feels like you have absolute control of your craft unlike other AG games where you feel like you're at the mercy of it's driving model. I don't know anything about the pedigree of the development team but there is clearly a passion for AG racing games there and it comes through in every aspect of the game, not just in it's driving model but in the clean art style and unobtrusive UI, making it clear that the racing comes first. The soundtrack also does a great job of setting the mood and while it's no FSOL, it is aggressive and energetic without being grating or tiring after a few laps. There are no traditional weapons in the game. You get two power-ups, one passive (i.e. better grip or energy recharge) and one active. The active (manually activated) powerups are more defensive in nature, mostly allowing you to leech and freeze energy levels of opponent craft, or protect your own, etc. That said, it's probably a good thing you don't have to watch out for mines, electro-volts, or turtle shells, because handling your craft and is a full-time job and can take quite a bit of concentration as the game moves tremendously fast. My only real complaint with the game thus far is the AI, which is abnormally aggressive at times. You'll definitely get knocked around the track a lot in the beginning, and you should expect to lose a race here and there through some questionable AI tactics. Other than that, Redout already feels like it could be a classic for the genre.			",46,3,2,1,1,0,1

												The best sci-fi / anti gravity racing game I've played since F-Zero GX and Wipeout HD. I honestly never thought I'd see a game in this genre hit such a high quality benchmark again.

												If you're like me then you're not so happy that Nintendo doesn't care about F-Zero and Sony shut down Studio Liverpool so there's no more Wipeout. Sure, you've explored older crazy fast racing games, and maybe you even picked up Fast Racing Neo on the WiiU, but that's still not enough. Then a ray of light shines through the clouds, and suddenly you are bathed in the glory of Redout.Inspired by crazy fast racing games of yore but with ideas and ambitions of its own Redout is a fine adition to the family of AG racers. With a large amount of even types, 6 ship types to pick from with 4 tiers each, an equippiable (and upgradeable) passive and active skill for those non-pure events, and 4 stat categories that you can upgrade, 4 track themes each with a multitude of unique feelings tracks, a seemingly Wipeout inspired soundtrack but with compositions set to fit the track rather than on a playlist, VR support, top-notch visual presentation and a feeling of speed I've been wanting to experience for a long long time Redout is a must buy for any fans of the genre, especially those wanting this type of game to make its way back to PC.My only two complaints are that you can't place bots in online multiplayer matches (So that is only 2 other people are in the lobby you can still fill out the other slots until new players join) and you can't fully customize gamepad controls. Why isn't LB set to use your active power-up? Why X?TLDR; I've had a fantastic time with Redout, its full of great stuff, futuristic racing fans should pick it up.			",369,92,7,49,45,4,95

												Furiously fast, floaty, fantastic, with some frost!Redout is a game where you go really fast on antigravity speeders in the future, like, really fast. (And you have boost on top of that, too)Redwine's controls are very floaty on purpose, and it doesn't really feel that much like a car. It definitely feels like you're floating. You aren't completely disconnected from your direction of travel, though, it's just more distant than usual. In Redwood you can race in a bunch of modes on tracks located in Cairo, Egypt; Alaska; Abruzzo, Italy (kinda), and a Volcanic region, with each increasing in difficulty in the order I listed, kinda... This is because each region also has its own difficulty curve with the available tracks in the region, which you unlock as you progress in the Career mode.For weapons, Redwire has some, but they are not directly offensive. For example, there is a beam that allows you to drain the boost energy from an opponent and use it to fill yours, a passive shield that hard counters the previously mentioned beam, and a more powerful boost that lets you go much faster, in exchange for dumping your entire energy pool into it all at once, to name a few. You definitely won't be shooting rockets at people or leaving behind spikes, though. These power-ups are not pickups, and are equipped before a race starts. There are also passive powerups that you use to accompany the active powerups, with things like making your boost more efficient, increasing grip, making you respawn faster, etc. This is on top of being able to buy upgrades for your ship. There is also a ""Pure Race"" mode that does not allow powerups.Redcard has online multiplayer as well, but not split screen. The online multiplayer is rather dead at the moment of writing this review, I hope it picks up. There will be split screen in the future, as the devs have mentioned before, but for now it's just you and the AI, or online people.What I really, really like about Redalert is that after sort-of getting the hang of the floaty ships, turning early etc, it is an absolute blast to play. I love the feeling of speed, and the floaty ships actually makes it feel more fun to drive.I definitely recommend Redflag to anyone who thinks this will fit their interests. But if the floaty ships don't do it for you, don't get it, because they are not cars, get a car game instead.			",119,15,4,6,9,2,11

												I am a big fan of WipeOut, starting with Pure and progressing through HD and Fury.  I was the kind of guy who got golds on all career events in that game.  I was a bit wary of this game not meeting my expectations, and other than the radical graphic design of all the team names, this game totally lives up.For those worrying about performance (hitting and maintining 60FPS is absolutely key in these AG arcade games), I have a GTX 670 and this game defaulted to all Epic settings (ha) and maintains 60FPS without even a hesitation.  It's funny, because I would hazard a guess that it runs on Unreal, which is nothing if not optimized.I would love a pure Zones mode, but that would be a straight rip-off of WipeOut, and the Score mode here isn't far off...

												Would I reccomend you pay $35 for it if you aren't a big racing fan? No.However, it is the closest to a F-Zero type racing game that has come out... Well, since F-Zero.It's challenging, engrossing, fun, and gorgeous. It's a fantastic racing game that I will play for many more hours. The AI is actually challenging and the handling of ships takes practice to master. The courses are extremely varied and there's no lack of creativity. I don't feel like I'm doing the same thing over and over at any point.But again, it's $35 for a singleplayer arcade racing game. I personally have had a thirst for a good racing game recently since there has been none (thanks NFS for sucking), so this quenched it thoroughly. However if you aren't big into the racing genre or a fan of F-Zero, wait for it to go on sale.Otherwise, definitely purchase it. I see myself getting a good 30+ hours out of this before I start to get bored of it/not play it frequently. Tons of courses and ships to master.EDIT: There is a multiplayer mode, but I have yet to be able to find a single match with other people online, which is why I said it is a singleplayer game. Which is fine, because it excels at what it does in SP. I think the game just doesn't have a big enough playerbase to consistently find MP games.			",171,17,5,10,5,0,7

 VR Review  Reviewed on Vive This is one of the most immersive VR games as of yet. Only a small space is required as there is no roomscale and it can be played sitting without the need for motion controllers. I used an Xbox One controller. It's one of the first VR games that isn't just a shallow tech demo or wave game. It boasts a career, online a quick play mode. In the career you can play a variety of maps in different gamemodes such as race and time attack and win contracts to upgrade your ship with money earned. There a quite a few different camera angles which is nice, such as bonnet view, cockpit view and third person view. I find that bonnet view is the best for VR in my opinon if you're going for the best time, but cockpit view is more immersive. The game itself pays homage to titles like F-Zero with a kinetic, gliding playstyle that makes you feel like you're in Star Wars.It's a must have for VR.I also want to add that it performs extremely well. I could run it at maximum framerate on normal settings at 150% upscaling with a GTX 970, i5 4690 and 16GB RAM.			",101,12,3,9,13,0,4

												Redout is probably one of the better futuristic racers that came out in the past years. This game nails the feeling of fast rather nicely and you will go fast rather frequently unless you flat out suck at the game. There is a fair amount of teams to pick form. Each has their own unique design and performance and there will be one that will fit your play style as well as upgrades and augments that will help counteract your ships weaknesses. There isn't that many different locations but each location has a fair amount of tracks all varying in style and difficulty, In terms of visuals, absolutly stunning low poly graphics that make excelent use of relfections. Now the downsides, I have three main complaints. The first is the difficulty. At first it as rather difficult but then it became stupidly easy. I don't know if its because I'm that good or the AI sucks that much later on but each race becomes a time trial no matter what the game mode might be. Another issue is a lack of conistant multiplayer. There are maybe one server once in a while and the players that do race are not very good. The last is the ""weapons"". The weapons are minor inconvenaces or flat out useless except for the boost upgrade that lets you use all of your energy for one big powerful boost. In the end, 8/10			",167,9,11,12,13,2,9

Product received for free
 Redout: Enhanced Edition  Right off the bat you can tell that this game is beautiful. The vivid, kaleidoscope of colours really helps it stand out from other games on the market. I have never played a lot of racing games but having Nvidia kindly send a code I couldn't not play this.  Gameplay  Brakes? What brakes?The fundamentals of this game are on the hover cars that are each different (made by different companies) that determine their stats such as toughness, energy storage or speed. Therefore, the way you race will depend on the car you choose.Even so, the hovering mechanic means that corners rely heavily on planning and reaction time that makes it difficult to get used to since there is almost no drifting and so the use of boosting to squeeze out makes it more interesting. The idea of hover cars also allow for vertical turning also. This means you must turn upwards to go around a loop the loop for example which adds more diversity and skill to the already fast paced game style. Undeniably, you will reach high speeds and make it more difficult to control, but... That's where the fun is. I felt I should mention the music here since it is different for each zone and truly captures the aesthetic of the location and action of the racing that truly stood out in my opinion. A con with such high speeds is that it'd take a fairly decent computer to cope with the amounts of screen blur and textures zooming past as you weave through corners to win your well deserved gold. It also makes it difficult to take in the beautiful scenery that the game has to offer.The option for VR is also available, however, due to me not having any form of this you will have to take a look for yourself if you were interested as from what I've heard, it's something to definitely try. Career mode  The main focus of the game. It allows you to level up your character and earn money to purchase upgrades and new cars that each belong to companies that go from classes 1-4. The races include varieties of game modes such as ""Time attack"" which is your stand need for speed cliché. There are also other game modes that require more personalised vehicles to win such as ""Survival"" which is truly a challenge. The A.I is also a neat addition that provides a nice challenge to the multiple races you'll go through to progress. More often than not you will be matched fairly in 1st place and any failures will cost you 3rd or even more since the speeds you travel at make it almost impossible to catch up, especially in more difficult tracks. Additionally, the A.I often knocks you out at the very beginning as they rush past in the one life modes that can be fairly difficult to deal with at times. Despite this, different zones and tracks in those zones are often very entertaining to drive around as you slowly master them and win your tournaments like a true champ. After 6 hours of career, I never felt bored of racing through the tracks as the variety of places gave all the tracks a unique feel that were decently laid out. Later on, however,  Customizability  The game lets you earn money for winning races and allows a fairly quick progression that increases the difficulty each race making it more necessary to buy upgrades for that class of ship. There are also power-ups in this game that you are able to buy but are not picked up like you woul find in Mario Kart. Instead you have an active power up that activates when you press a designated key and also a passive that is always active and both can be upgraded to a maximum of 4. From my experience, they are only truly necessary for extra speed and sometimes the other game modes but I never found myself experimenting with different combinations, even so, they are important in the later stages of the game and may make the beginning easier. It is also worth mentioning the different models of the ships that are very pretty to the eye and have colour customization available.  Online  Due to a lack of friends, I have not had a chance to test the feature out but due to the timings of your laps being compared globally as well as your friends I imagine it would allow you to compare your friends' career times and earn bragging rights.  Summary  All in all, I believe this game to be a fantastic entrance to the racing genre with it's beautiful style and lights to the fascinating, fast-paced gameplay. I could not say much for replayability as you would expect in most racing games and the sale price may not be everyone's treat but if you were looking for something to sink your teeth into, Redout surely offers a great start to the genre as well as offering other options like VR.

My eyes are dry now. I've spent the last hour not blinking or TRYING to not blink!Redout. It came from nowhere and screaming along at speeds that, in any sane world, would rack up speed tickets at the rate of pounds per second, be rightly dismissed as the sport of lunatics. Anti grav racing? But that died out with Wipeout? Wipeout HD and Fury on the Playstation 3 got that nailed and then Sony went and shuttered the studio, forever killing the dreams of futuristic racing! There's been pretenders to the crown, and there's been promise in the form of Formula Fusion, made by the very same people who developed Wipeout in the first place, but realistically? It ded. Dey killed it.Then Redout appears. It blazes out of the gate with style, with a design and artistic approach all of it's own, rather than going for lots of visual noise it keeps things simple, but at the same time visually appealing, lots of flat, but colourful polygons, creating a sort of ""Lo-fi"" approach that will run at a very smooth framerate once you've figured out just what detail setting you can get away with. The first thing you notice is just how -fast- this thing goes, this isn't just floaty sleds on a track, this is doing loop the loops at closing on 1,000 k/mh, this is vaulting into the sky at speeds that shouldn't even be *possible*, and with turns that require you to react on near instinctual levels.Antigrav racing taken back to the fundamentals and then purified to a very raw, crystaline formRedout doesn't really do weapons, there are some, such as a leech and an EMP, but critically you get to choose what your loadout is before you even begin the race. This means there's an element of tactics in the game, rather than praying to RNGesus you get a shockwave off of a weapons pad. This means you're wieghing up the choices before the race even begins, and working out what will best serve you in the race ahead, once you've a few actives and passives unlocked, you'll be changing loadouts around regularly.Each racer gets to pick one active and one passive, the passive can be simple stuff like a flat boost to a given stat, or it can be a conditional such as a bigger boost but only when in an opponents wake. Whereas the active is something you have to set off, and it takes from a shared ""energy pool"" that's also used for boosting, so you have to make discrete choices as to when it's time to use your active, and when it's time to get that extra kick of speed. (In the case of the Turbo, you get to choose whether to use some energy for a little boost, or to hold off and fill the bar to 360BLAZEIT for a giant whack out of the Turbo)Repairing is done automatically, provided you didn't dink either the course or another racer after a few seconds, with the hull bar creeping up ever so slowly once the repair routines kick in, at the speeds you're charging around the track in, those precious few seconds of hull can often make the difference between life and death, occasionally you may even want to slow to draw out as much repair as possible, being mindful all the time of your opponents.It's all very well thought out, with an eye to keeping you constantly focussed on the track and your opponents, because the speed at which the game goes is real ""Blink and you'll miss it"" stuff.A very high bar to set from a very new studioThere's areas where I can, and will nitpick, being someone who deeply loved the Wipeout series. First and foremost is the fact the teams lack ""definition"" at this point, they're nice to unlock and they have different stats, but I don't really feel what sets them apart from one another, that might be something to delve into with more worldbuilding and background. There's bugs (such as the Top speed on vehicles plummeting when you buy the Acceleration upgrade) but those will get patched out). The multiplayer is a work in progress (but they know that), and the Career could do with more ""structure"" (There's a lot of it, but it's very flat in how it rolls out).However, does any of this detract from what is an amazing game? Nope. Does any of this take away from the fact we've FINALLY GOT A WORTHY AG RACER ON PC? Nope.About. Damn. Time. Thank you devs. We now have a proper AG racer.Verdict : Highly Recommended ",1647,571,92,264,280,18,320

												Finally someone put Wipeout on PCI've been on the lookout for a decent Wipeout clone ever since I first got a PC. Redout popped up as a new release and I figured I'd download it and if it wasn't good enough I could refund it. Well, no need to have worried, it's fantastic. The all-important feeling of speed is certainly there, the tracks are exciting and fiendish, the ships beautifully designed. There's an upgrade system to the ships allowing the player to improve their current ship and also buy new ones from the same stable. Rather than picking up weapons on the track, you purchase them (and also performance enhancers) - one to be triggered at the user's discretion and one to act passively throughout the race. These additions can also be upgraded using the in-game currency you earn from racing.It's not an easy game, there is a learning curve to each vehicle and each track. However it's not so difficult that a little applied playing won't give you the feel of the jet that you need to place well in the races and time trials. Different restrictions are applied to events to add even more interest to this pedal-to-the-metal racer. On top of all this, the whole game is gorgeous, even down to the loading icon. The Trance-like background music is pretty much exactly what one would want as well.A special thank you goes to 34BigThings for coding it such that you can INSTANTLY replay a track without it having to reinitialise. I really appreciate this, it bugs me no end when I want to replay a level in a game and it takes just as long to start as if I'd chosen a new one.I absolutely love this game and if you're a fan of Wipeout or F-Zero or both, you should grab it immediately. To my mind, it is an instant classic.			",44,10,3,0,1,0,2

No hand-holding included. If it wasn't for the adrenaline-killing, killjoy voice of the announcer after every race, this would have been perfect. Still a great game to recommend.

												To be quite honest this is my first Review. If you were a big fan of games such of wipEout, F-Zero, and other games in the futuristic anti-gravity racing genre then I highly reccomend this game. This game takes some getting used to if you havent played a hardcore anti-gravity racing game for a while but you'll come to enjoy it. All in all the setup of this game is spectacular it the tracks are challenging and the ships even have there ups and downs. The bots ingame are a frustrating yet fun part of that challenge. In higher ranked ships the bots are a god awful annoyance. I solely like the fact that there are only two dlc's for the game and that its not p2w (pay 2 win).  The price for the game is worth it also i reccomend buying the enhanced edition over the regular game itself.			",11,1,4,6,2,0,1

												 While I love this game, there are issues with it. Primarily with the AI.First the positives:Excellent handlingGORGEOUS graphicsAMAZING soundtrackRuns extremely smoothlyCustomizable quick races, have 8 laps against 7 opponents!Gametypes!As listed, the game has been clearly cared for during development. Excellent handling, a wide variety of gametypes in case standard racing gets a bit boring, and visually pleasing throughout a lap.Soundtrack is amazing, PLEASE GIVE US THIS SEPERATE.Now the bad:AI is too goodBoost is spammableCollision is a little wonky sometimesThe AI is way too good on this game, one mistake, even a graze on the wall can result in a 3rd becoming last place. Also this may be just me but the bots will get very aggressive on the last lap.The energy boost, while a great feature, is too spammable. It doesn't seem to matter if I have a full energy bar or a tiny portion, I get the same result.The collision needs work I think, I get varying results from a little bit of sparks to being spun out from the same kinds of collisions.Overall, yes, this is an amazing AG racer in the same vein as F Zero, and the kinks are there but can easily be fixed in my opinion. Worth the buy!			",211,14,10,24,7,0,16

												Brand new to the FZero/WipeOut genre of racers. I took a chance after I saw a streamer play Redout, and I'm loving every minute of it. The art style is delightfully simple. The frame rate seems very stable. The music is awesome and gives you a great rush when you're doing really well on a track. Some feedback for the devs:Personally, I would love a short tutorial on the mechanics. I played a bit of Mario Kart, so I was somewhat aware of strafing around turns, but with no visible feedback that my strafes were helpful, I wasn't sure (until I ran the same track a few times) that it was even doing anything. Maybe something that just runs through what each of the markings on the track mean as you go through a run, and some tips/tricks.Currently, your powerups are bound to the X button with seemingly no way to change. This forces me to take my thumb off my right stick to activate them, which is a pain with ones like the Magnetic Grip that's useful to activate going into a turn. But what's strange is, the RB isn't being used by anything. Could the powerup button be swapped to the RB?There are a few missing words and odd syntax/spellings, like the ""Do You (sic) wish to"" bit when you want to go back to the main menu. Not the end of the world by any means. Just something I noticed a couple times.All in all, I was glad I dropped the $31.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you miss Wipeout and F-Zero buy this game. Customizable ships, contracts that award large amounts of credits and a large number of ships make this game worth the buy. The gameplay? The fast-paced races and even faster ships give this game everything it needs to be a great raver. The soundtrack has a very futuristic techno feel and blends seamlessly with three games world. I recommend this game for race fans as well as those that want to simply go fast.			",34,6,1,9,0,0,1

A New Dawn For AG RacingRating: 5/7 (✩✩✩✩✩) Highly RecommendedIntroduction:Redout isn't shy about stating its influences: ""F-Zero, WipeOut, Rollcage, and POD""—and while name-dropping is a dangerous game, I'm pleasantly surprised to say these folks can back it up. Now, I've never had the pleasure of playing POD, but I did enjoy Star Wars Podracer & even Megarace back in the day—and I think those had their share of influence over Redout as well. This game reminds me the most of F-Zero, but it does a lot to scratch my WipeOut itch as well—and that's really been my favorite AG game since the beginnig. There's a lot of love—and nostalgia—for the AG racing genre... and that means high expectations. There are some big shoes to fill.So does Redout stack up against all these legends, especially at a time when expectations are high for a competent new entry into the AG genre?Yes. Yes it does.AG Racing TL/DR Bullet Points: Excellent sense of speed Unique, technical controls Vertical axis as important as horizontal Great hovering feel Beautiful graphicsA Stand-Out AG Racer:Nostalgia for the AG genre has been boiling for a few years now. F-Zero hasn't seen an entry for over a decade, and after the close of Studio Liverpool (formerly Psygnosis—the creators of WipeOut), hope for an up-to-date ""AAA"" AG game has been teased at best. Some independent community projects have been looking promising, and the hype train has been dooting its way through Kickstarter for some time now—but nothing truly solid has really been happening.Then, out of nowhere, Redout busts in the door, lays its cards on the table, and drops the mic through the floor.Quietly in development for 3 years, this game bursts onto the scene fully-formed, and totally righteous.One of the best things about this game is that despite its roots, it has a clear identity all its own. It reminds me of F-Zero. It reminds me of WipeOut. It reminds me of Podracing. Of Megarace. But it isn't any of them, and doesn't imitate any of them completely. Redout has its own look, its own feel, and its own control scheme. It manages to be novel, unique, and stand out from the crowd—all while staying familiar and true to the AG genre. I don't think I could be more impressed. It sure isn't what I expected, but man am I pleased.Handling:Probably the very most important part of an AG game, and certainly the definitive aspect of the genre. F-Zero set the standard, and there are endless debates about which entry in the WipeOut series has the best feel and controls. It's clear that WipeOut was inspired by F-Zero, but the game had a feel all its own—and the same is true for Redout. So what makes it stand out? Verticality.The tracks in this game have loops and twists the likes of which I haven't seen since X-treme G on the N64—and Megarace on DOS PC before that. And this time they aren't just there to look cool—nailing an up or down transition is just as important as nailing a turn in Redout. If you fail to pull up on a steep incline, your pilot will start to black out, and you'll scrape the floor. If you fail to push down on a steep crest, your pilot will red out (the game's namesake); the screen will go red and it seems like you momentarily lose some speed and grip as well. Unlike most racing games, Redout will have you thinking up and down just as much as left and right.Another very unique thing about Redout is the control scheme for turning. You've got the basic turn on the left stick like any other AG racer after the early 32 bit days, but instead of opting for a left and right airbrake system, they've done something a little more interesting. Instead of modifying your turn with directional braking, the ship has strafing thrusters—controlled by the right stick (alongside pitch) by default. There is an air-brake, but it isn't directional—and in the words of Captain Falcon, ""Real men don't use brakes."" The developers claim that every single turn in the game can be taken without using the brake—once you get good enough.The best way I can describe how to use the strafe is to think of it as the second half of your steering limit. Once you've maxed out your left stick, start moving the right one. There might be a better approach, but this is what has really started make everything click for me. If you just jam both sticks at the same time, the ship kind of wobbles and slides—but using the right stick to modify the turns deliberately not only pays off, it's essential.Difficulty & Challenge:On the subject of gitting gud, Redout is a highly challenging game—I would say moreso than most games it would be compared to. At very least, the learning curve is a lot more steep. It took some time to get used to the ""strafing"" system, but once it started to click, it started to become natural. The controls really didn't start to sink in for me until after about 7 hours of play, but they never felt unfair. It was clear I just wasn't doing it right. And once I DID start to get it, the game went from pretty and fun to satisfying. I started to access that hyper-focus euphoria that draws me to these high-speed games in the first place.Powerups & Upgrades:There are tactical powerups you can use in this game, but I hesitate to call any of them ""weapons."" The closest thing to a weapon is the EMP blast, which temporarily disables opponents' energy—tied to powerups and the boost function. Other powerups include an extra-powerful boost, a repair drone, extra shields—things of that nature.You get one passive slot, and one active slot—powered by the ship's recharging energy bar, also used to power the boosters. Passive slot powerups can do things like increase your health, speed, or grip—among other things.Tracks:Redout has a satisfying array of 20 tracks across 4 environments; desert, snow, jungle, and lava. As stated above, these tracks have a lot of vertical changes. There is a wide range of difficiulty represented across the tracks. They range from wide-open, high speed tracks with slow, swooping turns to tight, complicated, and highly technical cat's cradle nightmares that require absolute focus, memorization, and accuity. Even within the same environment (say, ""desert"") there is a satisfying amount of track variation.Ships:6 distinct teams, and 4 speed classes with their own unique ships. Each ship looks and feels different, and each team suits a different play style. Each ship can be upgraded directly in 4 areas, in addition to the powerups; thrusters, magnets, shields, & energy. Each one will upgrade one or more stats such as speed and acceleration or grip. The designs are a lot of fun, which leads into:Graphics & Art Style:The art style in this game reminds me of what I imagined whenever I looked at cover art for arcade games in the late 80's. It has a fairly low-poly ""arcade"" style, but each facet glistens in the light and reflects its surroundings. It reminds me a bit of this one old arcade game... Stun Runner; except Redout looks like the idealized version of what that game was trying to be back in the day, graphically speaking. 80's / 90's low-poly arcade / Lawnmower Man type stuff. Bright colors. Shiny surfaces. Blistering speed. It's gorgeous. The graphics in this game are absolutely beautiful, and provided your system is beefy enough, the gameplay is buttery smooth. The options are reasonably scalable, and just about any modern system will play it reasonably well.Music:High-speed electronic music that reminds me a bit of later F-Zero games; totally at home in the genre.Conclusion:If you've been itching for a fun, challenging, and very fast AG game... your ship has arrived.

												I try/buy pretty much every Wipeout clone that comes out, so this was a no-brainer. When I first played it, my impression was that the game was gorgeous, but I didn't really like the controls becaue they felt too sluggish and stiff. So I didn't play it much at for several months, got distracted with other games. Then I dove back in and realized I was only using half of the control scheme. It turns out, the right stick is *critical* to gaining full control of your ship. It's basically like a strafe. Once I got this baked into my brain, I fell in love with this game and realized it's easilly the best thing since Wipeout, if not better! Where many clones fail, Redout succeeds: track design. Not only are they pretty, but the satisfying nature in which curves are shaped and linked give them high replay value. It's a total thrill all around, worth every penny and more.Oh and one more piece of advice: Turn off the motion blur! It makes it a lot more difficult to anticipate the track ahead of you. Everything looks more crisp when it's turned off, and you won't be hitting the walls as much.			",26,2,6,0,4,0,0

Product received for free
Steam key provided by the developer for review.Scorecard:http://i.imgur.com/d0uPHGw.pngFull review with screenshots:http://www.techfreshness.com/game-review-redout/  Feature Y/N/Rating   Aspect Ratios 16:9, wider crops vertically w/o ini fix   Framerate Cap Unlimited, optional steps between 30 and 240   SLI No   Performance Good   Options Above Average, but missing a few things   Key Rebinding No   Controller Support/Rebinding Yes, No   Multiplayer Online (12 Players) PC Port QualityRes and win/full/borderless only available in config files. In game has v-sync toggle, variable framerate cap, and resolution scale [40-100%]. Graphics options incl. AA, textures, effects, shadows, view distance, and post processing bundles a number of things but motion blur was separated out in patch 1. Ship and screen HUDs can be toggled, but certain things like trial timings will still show. FOV adjustment for each of the views would be welcome.Keyboard and Xinput controllers are supported simultaneously (mouse does nothing), button prompts are switched in the menu. No rebinding (said to be in the works) or axis inversion other than 3 preset controller layouts. All movements support analog, but the speed/frequency of turns means it's not as essential as it is to say a racing sim. It's still very satisfying and can be played competently with just the keyboard, I even preferred it in the end. Only issue is that that camera rotation isn't bound, so you also can't rotate the ships in the menu without the controller.No SLI support, but can be forced through Nvidia Inspector for +25-30%. Performance is good for the visuals on offer, and it scales well enough, the lowest settings pushing ~40-60% more frames vs maxed.GameplayIncredible speed, and you're given the control to make it around even the challenging tracks without dropping your momentum. Where Wipeout controls like a snowboard, somewhat rigid in the direction you point, Redout gives you constant strafe control and is overall much more slidey. You can use it to simply reposition around the track, to assist you by pushing into the turn, or to over-steer early and strafe/drift around. Depending on your ship choice you can use it for different things, but you'll need to learn to use it regardless if you want to set decent times.3 Boosts: Controlled release via ship energy, a large boost for 100% energy while using a certain ability, and boost gates around the track. The 6 ship teams all have their own sets of attributes that allow you to turn in different ways, take more damage, regain energy, etc. Passives abilities basically augment those attributes, so you can double down or go for a more balanced approach, while actives do some of the same things in a time-limited form while either spending all of or draining your energy over time.You can't manually lift off the track at any time like Wipeout, but there are plenty of jumps, some of which require you to take them at a specific angle or pitch your ship correctly to land soon/late enough to avoid obstacles. Pitch is also needed to avoid grinding your nose during loops/hills, and becoming unstable in reverse loops and sharp declines.Everything available in the career is also available as quick/custom races from the main menu. 10 modes are offered, mainly consisting of time trial and race variant. Some increase damage and/or remove the respawn, some disallow abilities, etc. The interesting ones imo are Boss (Each lap is through all 5 tracks of a location, chained together with teleporters) and Score (endurance race where racing cleanly and quickly rewards you with points).Across the 4 speed classes, there are 24 ships in total, each with 7 color palettes. Ships have 1 active and 1 passive ability slot, 6 of each to choose from. The 4 locations (basically Egypt, Arctic, forest, and volcano) have 5 tracks each with no reverse layouts.12 Player Online. You can view available games (in session or not), join a random one, or host your own (publicly or privately). Only modes currently to chose from are Race and Pure Race (No abilities). There is no way for a host to limit ship tiers, so it usually ends up being class 4 only unless others are nice enough to see and match a player that chose 1-3, which may be their only option because of the progression system.A big problem for single-player but even more so online, is how ship collisions are handled. Boosting is common, so when you are inevitably hit from behind, you're often spun around backwards, completely ruining your chances of winning. Alone you can simply restart and the AI isn't as aggressive, so it's less of an issue but should still be addressed. Disabling collisions work, moving the player up or laterally sideways would work too.ProgressionAll of the content is gated behind leveling and currency earned in the career/online. 6 hours should get you the highest tier of ships and all the tracks, but you still have to earn currency to buy the ships/abilities and their upgrades. This effects online too; so you can't really hope to compete till you've unlocked most of it.PresentationSeeing this in motion, I was honestly astonished at how good this looks with how few polygons and textures are used, especially so from an indie studio. There are screen-space reflections all over the place, adding detail and complementing all the rich colors and varied light sources.The music is dynamic based on speed and is specific to each track, but it's largely rhythmic, lacking melodies/riffs that usually make electronic tracks so catchy. The engine effects are extremely mild, and really everything lacks proper presence in 3D space, but the air speed and collisions sound alright, with environmental effects in enclosed spaces / underwater.ConclusionRedout is an absolute blast. There are a few issues, it’s not quite what I’d call “content-rich”, but I am floored by the absolutely sublime game feel. They’ve crafted a handling model here that feels unique even within the anti-gravity racing genre; a wildly satisfying combination of flow and slip while also being responsive enough for you to face these challenging tracks at such high speeds. The 20(+4) tracks provide enough to do in a title so centered on mastering the mechanics, but more definitely couldn’t hurt. If they want to make that easy, I think it would be very wise for them think about a track creation tool and/or procedural generation, along with a minimal/dynamic aesthetic (Wipeout HD Zone mode) to make content generation as easy as possible.If you yearn for more Wipeout, as long as you understand that this is not trying to copy it, but rather approach many of the same principles in it's own way, you're going to love this. If you're an average racing fan but have yet to play an anti-gravity title, just expect a significant challenge and loose/slippery feel but still very responsive controls. For a beginner, you're going to have to work at it, a lot, but there's still fun to be had.			",1389,483,59,145,135,19,178

If you want to see more, check out totalbiscuit's youtube review.  It's why I pulled the trigger and bought the game, and it hasn't disappointed me.Raced once on the monitor...then using my HTC Vive, wow...if you have a VR helmet, then you are in for such a treat.  The first race, where the track bends and twists over on itself, it was gut-wrenching...and I mean that in the BEST way possible.  Then on the second track I played, there was a straight jump, and the sensation in VR was amazing.  Simply haven't had a game that give me ""butterflies"" in my stomach like this.  Even if you don't have VR, it's a great game.This game could easily be $50 or even $60, and still be worth it.Thank you to all involved in the development of this game!!!

												While this game doesn't have missiles, it still has non-stop fast-paced racing action in enough flavors to keep it interesting.I bought this game because I effing love WipeOut. The high-speed racing looks amazing with the ""low-poly"" stylization of the game.As the game progresses, it gets harder requiring more and more skill to handle the insane courses at high speeds. Twists and turns that need drifting, climbs and dives that require pitch control; all of it while racing against the clock and/or actually good racing AI that is challenging, not cheap.If you like AG (anti-graivty) racing games, and yearn for one on the PC that isn't emulated, hop on this train.

												If you loved WipeOut then you'll love this. The tracks are amazing and the flying feels great. It has a slightly different style of handling compared to WipeOut but you get used to it quickly if you've played AG racers before and it feels very fluid. The career progresses at a nice pace and there are many ships and powerups to purchase and upgrade. I have fully upgraded my tier 4 starting ship after 3.6 hours, so it doesn't take too long and once you have enough credits you can purchase the other ships and upgrades. Tracks unlock as you progress and are extremely fun and well made (aside from a few dodgy jumps). There are boss races where you race each track from a particular area all in one go by travelling through portals at the end of each section. The longest ones i've done take about 4 minutes per lap and I think it's a really great idea. The AI rubberbands as people have said although they do often collide with walls and end up stopping. I prefer the AI to 'cheat' and give me a good race though, it certainly makes the races intense. My main gripe with the game so far involves the collision between ships which often ends up completely spinning your ship around in the worst cases. Try to avoid contact with other ships as much as possible. Defintely the best AG racer i've played in a long time, it has so much potential and there seems to be a decent amount of content at the moment. Highly recommended to any AG racing fans!

												TLDR: Game is a very fun fast paced racing game and well worth what it costs for what you get. I recommend it for anyone who enjoys racing games.Full explanation/review:I'm 2.3 hours into this game and already am loving it. I was just searching Steam for a fun racing game that stood out to me, because I've had an itch to play one recently. This game definitely scratches that itch and furthermore excels in the fun factor. I also wanted a racing game that didn't include combat and weapons in it, and while the ships in this game can have some offensive abilities like an ""EMP"" to slow down other ships by draining their energy, it's done in a way that makes sense and adds to the game nicely.If you are considering buying this game, here's some pros and cons for me that might help you in your decision:Pros:- Fast paced racing that is exciting.- Feels great when you nail the turns and pass the other ships.- The graphics aren't exactly realistic but are visually pleasing even though most stuff is flying by really fast.- Learning the game and it's tracks is fun and gives a sense of accomplishment once you do start winning.- The music in game is pretty cool too!Cons:- It can br frustrating when other ships bump you and fishtail you.- It can also be frustrating when losing a lot and retrying the same track again and again.Although I will say the cons are probably present in any racing game, and if you are losing a lot you can go back to easier tracks or ones you know better and work towards upgrades to help you progress.Some information about other things in the game:- The user interface is nice in that you don't really have to take your eyes off your ship to see your health and energy, both of which usually heavily influence your strategy and tactics while racing.- Your ship has a health bar, energy bar and power ups you can use.- You lose health when bumping the sides of the tracks or when you don't angle your ship correctly when going through loops or down steep drops.- Energy is used when you use your turbo or some power ups (turbo is a speed boost all ships seem to have by default, and your energy regerates when not being used, making it good to time using it effectively).- You can unlock power ups after you level up your pilot a bit (level 3 i think, which is easy to get to).- There are two categories for power ups, Active and Passive and you can only have one of each equipped at a time.- Power ups can be leveled up themselves 4 times each.- You gain in game money/currency by completing races in Career mode (and potentially online mode, but I haven't tried that one yet).- The in game currency is used to purchase higher class ships with better base stats, the active and passive power ups, and to upgrade the power ups.- There seems to be a lot of tracks to choose from/to unlock, so I can't see myself getting burnt out on that for a while at least.- I used an xbox 360 controller to play this game so far, not sure how it plays with mouse and keyboard.To sum things up, if you want a fun, fast paced, pleasing to look at, feels good to progress racing game, this will go above and beyond at satisfying your needs. At first I thought it was a bit pricey (at 34.99 USD), but I couldn't be happier I added it to my library. I usually play ARPGs or RTS games but sometimes I need a good racing game to play and after not having had one to play for a while this was a site for sore eyes.I think this game is worth what it costs and is a real blast. 10/10 In my opinion.I will update the information in my review if I find I am incorrect about anything in my review or if my opinion changes, but I doubt either of those will happen.

												Disclaimer: Redout was my first AG racing game. I can't say how it compares with Formula Fusion or Wipeout 2048, this review is entirely based on my experience of the game as a newcomer to the genre.Verdict: 8.2/10.Review machine: Intel i7 6700K, Asus GTX1080 Strix OC, 16Gb of RAM. Asus 2560X1440 144Hz Gsync monitor, game running at 2560X1440 and 120Hz. I spent my full playtime using an Xbox One ""Elite"" Controller.Flaws:> Controller Reliant.

												Disclaimer: Redout was my first AG racing game. I can't say how it compares with Formula Fusion or Wipeout 2048, this review is entirely based on my experience of the game as a newcomer to the genre.Verdict: 8.2/10.Review machine: Intel i7 6700K, Asus GTX1080 Strix OC, 16Gb of RAM. Asus 2560X1440 144Hz Gsync monitor, game running at 2560X1440 and 120Hz. I spent my full playtime using an Xbox One ""Elite"" Controller.Flaws:> Controller Reliant. It's absolutely reliant on a gamepad of some kind, without two analogue sticks the control scheme and driving physics fall apart.

												This is the fastest racing game i have ever played, I think. You can really feel the speed and it isnt that forgiving for mistakes but you sure can make things happen really quick. It is really fun and the tracks are most often not too long. It is easy to learn but i bet it will take time to master!I really recommend the game if you like fast racers and challanges!

												Redout is a great newage throwback to the old F-Zero style racing games. The visuals are amazing, There are 20 tracks across 4 worlds each world having its own beautiful landscape and each track having its own little features to it. The tracks get progressively more difficult as you continue through the game, and there is a steep learning curve for beginners. Recent updates have nerfed the AI in the first couple races but after that it gets pretty hard and fast. The controls feel a little loose and sloppy at fisrt but you get used to them and the game gets really fun as you learn the tracks and zip through the turns. There are 5 classes of ships each having 4 tiers of ships that race a lot faster each tier, so 20 ships total. Each ship has a few upgrades that you can purchase helping it preform better and can have the color patterns changed between 7 different paintjobs.The AI is harsh, there are a few races that I have no chance at keeping up, but other races I find very VERY easy and get gold or platinum on most of the races. There is some rubberbanding with the AI in a couple races, other races the AI is just brutally fast and you have to be 100% on point to keep the lead.Each time you get a new ship it's a unique feeling as you tear up the tracks faster and faster. When I hit the last tier it was a lot of fun going super fast, and a little dissorienting at times. You have to control the pitch of your racer as you go around loops and banks to prevent scraping your nose or tail on the ground, It's a great feature that isn't too rough to manage in the later tracks once you've ran them a few times.There are several active and passive upgrades to buy each can be powered up a few times to work better.Personally I enjoy the turbo boost with the magnetic stabilizer, it can create some really fast ""OH S%&#"" moments haha.The achievements aren't too hard to get either, which is nice. With their most recent update it fixed the one achievement not being able to be unlocked, so you can 100% this now.All in all I give this game a 9/10, only reason it's not 10/10 is because of the different AI behaviors in some maps.TL:DRGreat game, go fast AF, hit ramps, upgrade, get rekt by AI, restart races several times but have a lot of fun doing it. 9/10			",53,3,1,5,3,0,3

												NEXT GEN WIPEOUTI love this game, and here are the reasons:- The the soundtrack is a gem, sets the tone of the race and is well produced- Great variety of racing ships: about 24- Great variety of tracks, in different locations- extreeeeemly good looking game. Just check the screenshots, what you see is what you get- easy to play, difficult to master- great control scheme if using a controller- Quite hard, mostly the Pure Races. This gives it TONS of replay potential to grab a few more gold   medals for more credits- The difficulty makes it extreemly satisfing to beat the AI in career mode, also quite rewarding with many customisation options for the ships with abilities and powerups- Abilities and powerups allow you to customise your racer to you racing style - Agressive with turbo, Patient with extra grip ectBut, as with any game there are flaws:- Initially the difficulty was TOO HARD. I got thrown in the deep end and was crushed for about 20 races in a row. However practice pays off, and so does studying the race track.- Almost unplayable without a controller unless you are a god- Hardly anyone online, so no online races- some bugs with the AI at the start line, where the spin out and crash into you.- The AI's ships seem mush stronger than yours, they almost never crash and have to respawn. Also when they bump you, you are out of the race instantly as you WILL spin out, no matter how fast they are going or how hard they bump youI am really loving this game so far, played about 7 hours and not even a 1/4 through the career.

												I started off liking this, then the honeymoon was over, then we had a second honey moon for some good ole sexci timeThis game is seriously not for the feint hearted, too many complaining abt AI rubberbanding, the trick is how you upgrade your ship and which one you useWhile there is minor issues, the game overall is highly recommended for anyone who has played anything from Fzero to Wipeout This game is brutal, but it's worth the perserverance, just a shame so many people are just not patient enough

												Redout is a title that brings back the futuristic hover racing series that many fans had in the 90s, if you're a fan of the Wipeout and F-Zero series then you'll enjoy this hidden gem.However, the commentator/announcer voice sounds like the woman from the Hugh Mungus video and grows old very fast.I also had difficulty finding online matches, which maybe due to having to ""find"" this game rather than seeing videos and the front page of Steam's store.The track design again is reminiscent of Wipeout, but still feels fresh and unique despite sharing similarties.Bringing a ""Wipeout"" game back to PC is what a lot of people asked for, now they have it under a different name.While this game lacks weapons and may put off Wipeout fans, it does include progressions and upgrades for the ships that you pilot.tl;dr - If you're a fan of Wipeout and you've been looking for that fix on PC, then don't give this game a miss, it's well worth it!

												I always thought I was missing something in my life when I transitioned to PC almost a decade ago... little did I know deep inside I was waiting for a WipeOut successor and *poof* Redout appeared out of no where!The good my god is it beautiful to look at it has the pefect amount of colour balance and level design, now graphically it's not the best looking game but ♥♥♥♥ don't put it down for a second on that regard because they make up for it with the excellent designs. All the options are there, plenty of graphical options, audio and the typical racer game hud switches e.g km/miles etc. Now the real treat of all this game has to offer and it's straight hands down the best part and it's the god damn gameplay... the sense of speed is incredible it's so hard to explain but it's butter smooth an ♥♥♥♥♥♥ left for only your eyes to see... you just need to see it to believe it! Also another great addition is the soundtrack while it's mostly lowkey buried under the sound of amazing engines or the sound of wind and boost you will notice it and love it for what it is! There's also quite alot of floaty ship/car/boats to choose from and plenty and I mean plenty of upgrades... this is though mainly a racer and not a combat racer which is why I love it so much.Now the bad there's a couple of things I really really REALLY did not like and this is a terrible design choice in my eyes first and foremost I UNDERSTAND why people love the AI so much I do too but god damn was it a headache for the first hour of playing against it... it really doesnt help the game at all having unforgiving AI from the get go with no I REPEAT no tutorial! Theses are the little things you need in a game for a least the first 2 levels to introduce the new players... some people won't take a beating the first go and stay... some will straight up leave and like I said I think it's a bad design choice. If you don't want to change the AI at least put in a tutorial at the very least! Now one thing I didn't notice or perhaps I'm blind was an FOV slider in the settings menu didn't see one at all... this didn't help when playing on 3 screens at 5760 x 1080p while not too much of a problem it's easily fixed with a tweak because the camera by default is super zoomed in at that resolution. Not that it's a big problem but this game on the store page seems to say hey this is a VR game only some people have thought that and so did I at first perhaps put a sticky somewhere noting that you do not require a VR headset to play this game as it's not super obvious at first!So what do I think? I think it's one hell of a fun game and at this price point 100% for fans of this genre BUT I think for anyone out of the catergory wait for a price drop come back later when a few things are ironed out for new players because I know how it feels to sit through a game feeling beat and this game will beat you until you understand how it works!

												The controls, visuals, sounds, gameplay, feeling of speed... They nailed it. Races are long enough that the last lap feels tense but still short enough you are only slightly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you screw it up. The cars are responsive, the graphics are smooth, and the maps feel fair. While the odds of you getting a perfect race are excessively small, and you always have room to improve, you can see what's coming ahead of you and the game is designed to encourage you to push your speeds. The menus are quick and responsive and there are no long loading screens between retries, so even if you have a short attention span it's very easy to keep saying ""one more try"". This game is damn good at being what it set out to be, so I feel safe calling this a black and white recommendation. You either want this kind of game or you don't. If you do then there's no excuse not to buy it. If you are unsure I'd recommend TotalBiscuits video on YouTube, it shows what the gameplay is like and he does a good job explaining why it works. You should know after that if it's something you'd enjoy or not.UPDATE: So, good news and bad news. The good news is this game is good enough that I just spent about 7 hours playing it the day I got it. The bad news is in that time I've already unlocked all class 4 ships, fully upgraded all of them, and easily took golds in the final career races. Now, I'm not really that good, so usually I'd say it's time to jump into multiplayer where certainly I'll need to keep improving to play with the best - but sadly the multiplayer seems to be completely dead. I've checked a few times today and never seen more than 4-5 people in games I could join. Given that it's been peak hours on a 3 day weekend, on launch week, I'm going to assume this must be because of some sort of bug limiting access to multiplayer. Hopefully that's not a long-term issue and there continues to be more content, because this is definitely a game I want to play more.			",294,44,21,23,26,1,25

												I've been looking to get a racing game for a few years, but have been on the fence for every single one that came to PC lately. When I saw Redout I instantly got hooked on it. The speed, and style cought me with amazement and I had to get myself the game.I have never been interested in this genre of racing where there is ""Anit-Gravity"" and every ship feels like your sliding an ice cube on glass, but... This game FEELS SO GOOD.The AI is challenging, but rewarding when you beat them! You get this sense of accomplishment when you beat the stupid AI that beat you nearly all the time! I'm allways playing on the edge of my seat. I love how this game isnt geared for you to win, Its geared for you to play.Overall this is an amazing racing game. The game doesnt teach you well on how to play it but its very simple... I play with a keyboard. Well worth the full price in its current state.P.S. The Podracer sold me in the trailer :D			",62,5,1,5,2,0,1

												Growing up with the F-Zero and Wipeout series, there have been dozens, if not hundreds of games that have tried to capture that futuristic racing gameplay and feel. None of them have hit a bull's eye on what made the F-Zero and Wipeout games classics....until now.Redout is the F-Zero/Wipeout sequel that we never got and that's high praise. Using the Unreal Engine 4, Redout is a tour-de-force of eye popping visual design, exciting gameplay, tight and responsive controls and blistering framerates. The two stick controls work to perfection in controlling your racers with the ability to hug corners or pull up or push down the front of your ship, making hills or tight turns come to heel.The track design is outstanding with a great variety of visual goodies, loops, corkscrews, huge jumps and big banking turns....basically fantastic rollercoaster type tracks. You'll even encounter sandstorms, rain and other weather elements that add to the look, feel and play of the tracks.Worth every bit of the asking price! 5/5			",287,25,11,8,21,0,13

The difficult after getting to the 2nd class races jumps dramatically though which isn't bad just kind of jarring.  Looks amazing in the oculus rift and has a very good soundtrack.

												I don't have much free time but I can't stop playing this game. This is a true successor of Wipeout (which I always loved). 10/10.			",143,12,2,11,10,0,7

												(I was in the closed beta so I have quite a bit more hours than what it says)If you like arcade racers, get this, you will not regret it.A lot of people are comparing it to Wipeout and F-Zero (for obvious reasons) but this game, while taking inspiration from them, is definitely unique.Once you learn how it works, the driving model is amazing, using both sticks to turn, strafe and pitch is very satisfying, you're not driving a car, it's a ship, and you can feel it.

												The sense of speed in this game is incredible. It's the first racing game I've played where it actually feels like you're going at the speed it tells you. I used to love the Star Wars podracer game for PS2, and although this game isnt a Star Wars game, it really captures the feeling I think that game was going for.			",88,9,1,9,14,0,5

												Those who've played Wipeout now have a chance to experience roughtly the same gameplay again, but on PC and in VR!Redout, from the developers of Wipeout, is a high-octane, futuristic racing game with time trials, challenges and races. Sharp turns demanding strafing, loops demanding gripping and many different vehicles and vehicle brands to unlock and choose from will provide hours of fun. It has a full list of graphical options to tinker with to get the best out of both performance and Redout's stylized visuals. This game also supports HTC Vive and Oculus VR, though it is not mandatory. Single player campaign and online multiplayer are available and it even has support for 21:9 aspect ratio. Please note, if you're going to play in VR, you're going to have to turn down most, if not all, the graphical settings. Some don't mind this, but I found it a bit disappointing seeing as how I was running it on a high-end pc. Also, this game does NOT have weapons like Wipeout did, so don't expect those either.

												Absolutely badass racing game. If you like the mag racing genre, it's a no-brainer. One thing I will say is that I actually prefer it on flat screen to VR, which I wasn't expecting. I will of course be doing more 'research'. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Redout is like every great futuristic racer played at once. If you enjoyed the SNES F-Zero, you'll love the drifty handling, while the modernized controls make it so much more intuitive to play, you'll be skidding your AG machine like Dr. Stewart in no time.The powerup system reminds of Extreme G 3, and it graphically feels like some time traveller from a future past where Sega won the console war. The lovingly polygonal ships appear so beautifully gouraud at times, contrasting with the shining, brightly painted metallic circuits screaming past you faster than you can think ""golly this is pretty"". Even though you can count the individual vertices in the ships, there are some absolutely gorgous vehicle designs here. No none'a that ""aerodynamic spaceship blob with wings"" crap here. You got a BSG Viper, a podracer, a Thundercougarfalconbird, a flying spike, and a antigrav Lamborghini. Each speed class has a new model vehicle, and the vehicular designs' insanity only increases proportionally with their ground speed.If you loved gems like Aerogauge and Fatal Inertia, you'll enjoy the game mechanics and physics here, and you may find powerup system to be to your liking, allowing you to configure each ship to suit your racing style.But back to how fast this game is:You will mutter ""♥♥♥♥"" under your breath as your brain attempts to comprehend how fast this game actually is. There will be times when you just give up and bounce off the walls because your thumbs cannot keep up.This is perfectly normal. Continue playing and the machine will come to you, and the speed you desire will be yours. The tracks are gorgeous and flow very nicely, and the excellent dynamic soundtrack makes every race a pleasure. It's fun to go fast. It's fun to crash. It's fun to bump and rub with the AI (when it can keep up!)This game is excellent. ",98,3,28,3,10,1,3

												Redout is insane. It's honestly one of the most polished games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. It's so fast it's exhilarating, so hard it's frustrating and so tightly designed that it's just straight up fun.Here's some positives: Tightly designed. The level of control is unpredecented in most modern racers. Looks beautiful. Loads of single player content. Functional online multiplayer. Loads of cool ""modifiers"" for the career mode.And a few negatives: Must be played with a controller. It's damn near impossible with a keyboard. It really is frustratingly hard at points. Really not recommended for those looking for a simple, relaxing racer.Overall, I can heartily recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of classic AG racers like Wipeout or F-Zero. I had a load of fun with it.Oh, and here's a YouTube video in which I expand on my thoughts in more detail:
