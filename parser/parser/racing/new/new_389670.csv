Early Access Review
								Disclaimer: Kickstarter backertl;dr: Consider buying if you're a Wipeout fan, keep a close eye on it if you what you see looks interesting. Not remotely enough content for most buyers.The following is based on the Early Access launch version of the game.From some of the original Wipeout developers comes an extremely bare-bones but promising taste of a new AG racing game. At launch there is a single track, one craft, two modes, two weapons and three or so music tracks. Although this is in an early alpha state, the core mechanics are surprisingly satisfying. Compared to Wipeout, the handling is much heavier, collisions are much more punishing, and boosts are more rewarding. Accelerating into turns is not a viable strategy. To my delight, they managed to capture the awesome feeling of gliding as if on auto-pilot when completing three or four tricky turns from Wipeout.Even as someone with experience in this type of game, placing first in the race took nearly an hour. Collision damage makes it very likely that you'll die in your first attempt. Learning the track and placement of boost pads seems essential to winning. Currently there is one weapon in the game, and it's tricky to learn to use (hold the fire button until the missile locks on, then release). Overall, there is an hour of satisfying content here, obviously not yet enough to justify a €28 price tag.As for performance and ease of use, this game is very limited as you can imagine. The menus are not responsive, there's very little in terms of an options menu, but it does feature borderless windowed mode which came at a cost of around 10fps. On my hardware (GTX770, i5-4690k factory settings) I could maintain above 60fps in fullscreen mode on the highest preset. Sound effects don't appear to be implemented, though the music will be appealing if you enjoyed the soundtrack of the Wipeout games. The visuals are great, though obviously could use polish, and the track design seems solid for the first track.Personally, I'm very much looking forward to seeing where this game goes and will update this review throughout development. I'm not a big fan of racing, but I always liked the Wipeout games for their arcadey gameplay and split second handling combined with high fidelity visuals. Having played almost every entry to the series, I was disappointed to hear that Studio Liverpool was shutting down, and I'm glad that Wipeout is getting a spiritual successor in the hands of what appear to be capable developers in the form of Formula Fusion.

								Current version of this review is version 0.0.4 Needless to say, This game is in very early access state.This means there is only 1 race track, a handful of songs and a very basic menu.Also, the game can and will crash from time to time.Reasons to buy at this point in time.Gameplay:The crafts have their own unique style and you will likely get attached to your new favorite team pretty quick as new versions will come out.The game looks amazing and logo designs are as good as you would expect from the designer republic. The crafts don't fly from left to right corner. (can be considered a down point, but it works for the current track)It's very satisfying finally being able to make the corners correct after some practice.Currently no cap on FPS or screen resolution. (FPS hits a stead 60 fps on high end rigs) Community:You wish to support the independent creators or this game.You are aware the budget of this game is not that of a Triple A title. (There is basically no budget for PR)You have a lot of patience and look forward to every small update to see what the developers might add.You wish to help out in the creator by being a alpha tester and post bugs and feedback on the official forums.The people who kickstarted this game are very passionate fan most of them coming form the WipEout zone forums. the community is a lot of fun to hang out with and discuses game idea's with. It kinda feels like you're in a really big guild. Reason not to buy at this point in timeYou're expect a version 0.9.0 with a couple of tracks a single player campaign and any form of multiplayer. You just want to play a anti gravity racing game without much hassle.You are expecting loops and barrel rolls.You like it when crafts can make very sharp turns (the current crafts are fairly heavy) Might have some issue's running this on a old system.You don't really care about anti gravity racing game.Closing words:I believe this game will end up being great in the end, but it will take a lot of time and effort from both the developer and the community.

								I have been a 'Test Pilot' backing this game from early on and its been a long road but NOW is definitely time to jump in if you like your AG racers like wipeout.The negative reviews bashing the games physics were fair enough at the time early in development but are invalid now as the PHYSICS are MUCH IMPROVED, steering is more accurate and gradual, airbrakes are effective without being too strong and they have just added a proper AG float to the craft so they will catch air off drops and jumps and even slightly over crests.The graphics are excellent I run this game in 4K and it looks like a true next gen next step from wipeout HDs graphics.Coming soon are more great tracks, a garage mode to tweak handling further and multiplayer!If you are waiting for news the wipeout IP will be picked up and continued the wait is over ou can jump into Formula Fusion now for a very satisfying next gen wipeout like experience.

TL;DR: Only buy now if you want to help fund the game. Otherwise, wishlist it and come back later.The game right now is just a pre-alpha one track vertical slice. What's there is good ""guts"". You can tell it's from Wipeout people, and it is exciting to see the prospect of a Wipeout style game that's not constrained by console or handheld system specs (if you too overclocked your PSP to 333 MHz to get Wipeout Pulse to have a decent framerate, you know what I mean).Don't buy this now expecting a game, even an early game. It's barely past tech demo stage. But if you like Wipeout, click Follow or wishlist and come back when they at least get to beta stage.			",545,171,6,65,57,5,66

Early Access Review
								After testing out the big Update, which came out yesterday, I can assure you the following:It's the successor to wipEout, not perfect in it's current state, but it's going in the right direction.The gameplay is mostly positive, except for some things: - The airbrakes still leave a useless impression, you can get through the courses without them, except for the new FF2000 Class, Python. - This brings up the next thing; you're glued to walls. Crash into one and have fun getting off of it again. Most of the time you manage to get off the wall, you'll ride into the next one, because the crafts feel clumsy sometimes.Keep in mind, it's in early Access, so these things'll probably get changed over time.Still, in it's current state, it's not generating the same fascination like wipEout 2097/XL did for me;Braking before the curve, so you can glide smoothly through it, the crafts nose nearly tipping the wall. Scraping the wall with back of the craft, hearing that fulfilling crunchy sound. The floaty feeling of the crafts etc. If you've played 2097, you'll probably get what I mean.In my opinion, even to this day, 2097 got the best handling in the wipEout series, especially when flying a Quirex craft on Phantom class.I'd like to see the same handling making a return in Formula Fusion, even though i don't believe this'll happen.But a man can dream, right? ;)Buy it if you love wipEout and want to support the devs, it's totally worth the few bucks!

Early Access Review
								Everything in this is great, the graphical quality is amazing and the artstyle is a modern reboot of the older WipeOut.Obviously this game is in early access, so there are SOME quirks such as the handling which is always being improved as updates continue to be released. There is SOME frame drops in some of the much larger circuits in normal races against opponents, though this can easily be fixed with LoD models of the crafts.One thing that mainly annoys me is the particle effects emitting from the craft when going over boost pads. The speed in which they travel backwards makes the craft look like its moving slow, not faster, and the rockets not having better particles. But again, can easily be fixed later on.In lower graphical qualities, the settings appear to be rendered at a lower resolution and then scaled up, which is something I personally don't find very appealing to the eyes.The crafts' sounds are very basic, and could do with something new to make them sound a bit more powerful. Maybe something similar to craft sounds from WO2048. Maybe something different with every craft speed class to make it all sound ""fast"", rather than a low-pitched hum.Other than the ""issues"" listed above, I find this in-progress game very fun. Keyboard controls could do with a little tweaking, though!TL;DR: negative reviews are mainly existing because this is an Early Access title. Don't let that be the deciding factor for you, This game has serious potential. You won't regret it.			",55,7,5,5,7,3,7

								It is important to know that this game is not created by Wipeout programmers.  It is created by Wipeout 3D artists and musicians.  Consequently it looks very pretty but does not have the Wipeout feel.If you are looking to play a next-generation Wipeout I think you will be disappointed with the game in it's current state.  It is Early Access and maybe it will improve.  I hope it does.  In the meantime I suggest you look at BallisticNG.  It's free and it's very Wipeout.			",316,43,29,12,17,3,21

Off to a good start, but still a long way to goA good start so far, but still lacks enough content and polish to really be worth the purchase. If you are a big WipEout fan like me, then by all means buy this game now to support the devs. If you are not a WipEout fan (and apparently these people do exist), then you should probably hold off until a future update.ProsMade primarily by ex-WipEout devs (specifically those who worked on WipEout 3)Team also includes former Midnight Club and Carmaggedon devsA new IP in the dying Futuristic Racing genreGraphic design done by the Designers RepublicConsCurrently lacks content (includes only one ship, one track, two weapons)You can only choose one weapon to use for the entire raceHealth is regained by collecting easily-missed shield icons (would prefer WipEout-style pit lanes or weapon absorbtion)Currently has only minimal graphical options and no control optionsNot as good looking as WipEout HD (though i expect that this will change)Not as well optimized as WipEout HD (my gaming laptop only gets 30-45 fps on lowest settings and 10-20 fps on max settings)Side note:If you are a fan of WipEout or F-Zero, be sure to also check out the upcoming games Redout[34bigthings.com] and SlipStream GX, as they are said to have been inspired by the former two games. Also check out the super fun SlipStream GX Public Beta[www.wipeoutzone.com].			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								So as a huge fan of the WipeOut series, I'm happy to see this is coming along. However, I only purchased it right now to support the developers, who btw, seem to be making consistent updates. This is NOT a finished game. It needs a good amount of work. But here's hoping that it will be incredible when it does finally come out.			",92,6,5,6,7,1,2

								If you were a fan of all the earlier wipeout games then this a no brainer. The latest build definitely gives you the wipeout vibe and feel. Excellent design and atmosphere like you would expect from such a talented and experienced team. Its still in early access so not everything is done obviously. Content is low at this point but enough to keep ag-racers flying and polishing laptimes, getting the feel for it. You can feel the big picture of where its going. I can just sing praises for this game and cant wait until its completly done.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								A real mess, this one. The concept seemed great, and I was really excited to see a continuation of the Wip3out games.Lack of communication from the developers and a lack of updates during this Early Access period is bad enough, but they've even gone so far as to permanently lower the price to attract more sales, with no compensation to those who paid full price.Apparently they're posting the odd update on places like Facebook, but neglecting to keep people updated via the most direct medium; Steam. The place the game is being sold on, and they're not even keeping us posted here.Normally I'd not care about a permanently lowered price, since I had access to the game before new buyers did, but in this case it's just not okay. There's been one tiny update since I bought the game, and that introduced a single 'night' variant of one of the maps, making for a total of 3, one of which is essentially just a copy.I don't know what's going on with these guys, but just stay away from them until they sort themselves out.

								UPDATE: Okay guys I still recommend the game, but to people giving this a negative review I feel their opinions might be misplaced. Is the game as far along as it should be NO! not even close, but just heard their about to update(Imo) the most boring track NiagaraGP, and also think another big update set to come out too. Still be cautious on buying this title you're buying it now it's because it's cheap etc, but the updates aren't as fast as other titles for reference the game has been out since last August, and it's had maybe 2 major updates(not too sure also depends on definition of major), and many minor updates over that time span. Original ReviewAs it currently stands with this game although I'm giving it a recommend. I don't know if I'd say for the general public, but for those that played Wipeout etc I can see them getting this. I'd give it 2-3 more major updates before diving in(Who knows might only need one). Currently there are 3 tracks simply put 2 of the 3 for me remind of Wipeout HD/Fury for PS3, but one is a snoozefest(Niagara GP) at least atmosphere wise. I still have hope for the game, and not trying to down the dev team at all, but I know there is a long road ahead for this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Edit: There's an update on the 24th of December and there's several changes on the games. There's 2 tracks now. Day and night variations. No reverse. You can't ride on the rails to go faster now UI has changed quite a bit. Gone are the minimalistic UI to a more convinient one. There's also added a pitch to go up and downThe only promise they take is that they will release this game as full on August 2016.Original review.Formula Fusion is a futuristic racing game made by R8 Games partnering with Designers Republic. The game at launched in Kickstarter and Steam with the equivalent buzz of Yooka Laylee. Billed in many gaming journalism websites as a “spiritual successor made by former Studio Liverpool developers”, sleek looking graphics, the intent to ride on the E-Sports bandwagon and delivering high speed antigravity racing game akin to the “agile, complex and nimble” WipEout and not the “straight speed, no turning required” F-Zero. They say in Kickstarter that the initial £35,000 KS target was to allow them to create the “‘base game’, which will feature eight tracks created by the WipEout 3 track team and an early-access version featuring one fully developed track”. They actually doubled the goal to £79,656 and in 3 Aug, 2015, they launched this game to Steam.Like any alpha, there are lots of bugs that has yet to be solved and content that is lacking at launch. You can wall ride your craft without care about the hull integrity without getting penalised by slowing the craft down. The UI is minimalistic; the bad kind of minimalism which you need to squint down the screen (not up!) to see the important information like the amount of weapons tokens to deploy your weapon, the time of your lap as well as the energy level that you’re in. The replay value are also lacking. There are currently three tracks to choose from, all of which are reverse or reskins of one another. The 3 additional “QA tracks” exclusive to “Test Pilots” were textured in bare bones grey. One of the tracks struck me as amateurish and so basic that I personally doubt it's been made from some AAA developers like Studio Liverpool. The craft design were nice but currently all the teams selection are cosmetic and doesn’t affect the stats of the craft.The weapons selection? Two. Just two different selections of weapons. One is a hold-space-for-three-seconds-to-fire rocket and the other is the fire and forget “force wall” in WipEout 3.This would have been ok if the game is updated in a consistent time with a solid roadmap. Maybe monthly? Bi-monthly perhaps?Nope! The last update of this game was in 25th August 2015. Even when they secured new investment on the 5th of November, there’s no update from the time this review was posted. There are no guaranteed dates for the next update.All of this while some of the development staff and 2 community managers (one of which I will vouch on being extremely supportive) were laid off as their contract ended.Formula Fusion itself is nice, shiny and cool to show off your friends your GTX 980’s capabilities but from the content, the update schedule and stability as a company, it’s plainly not worth your $20.

Early Access Review
								(Review based on v0.0.4)First of all, some background. I've been playing the WipEout games since I discovered the third and went back to play 2097 and 64 and Wip3out Special Edition. I played a ♥♥♥♥ ton of Pure and HD/Fury. A bit of Pulse. I have Fusion but didn't liked it too much. Haven't played 2048 much since I don't have a Vita. So, moving on...The content is minimal (one ship, one track, two weapons, two music tracks, prototyped menus) so don't be buying this expecting anything near a complete, satisfactory experience, not even in the user interface. Buy this in order to support the developers so they can add content and fulfill their vision.What you get though, is a pretty promising skeleton of a game. The sole ship is beautifully rendered and the track looks nice (although I hope the floor gets higher resolution textures later on). The handling is based off 2097's. I'm not so sure about that since I liked the ""floaty"" handling of 3, Pure, Pulse and HD/Fury, it was nice to have some altitude control. This doesn't apply here, ship's altitude is fixed at the same height always. Not a bad feature, mind you, I guess I liked it when it felt a bit like an airplane and not a hovercraft ala F-Zero. The handling has a learning curve, specially if you're used to Wipeout HD, but it becomes second nature.I liked the boost of the speed pad. The camera struggles to keep up with the ship for a fraction of a second when you get a boost, which enhances the feeling of speed greately. I hope that in future versions they make the camera feel more like a real floating object so this motion becomes more natural.NO MORE RANDOM WEAPONS, my God, how am I glad of this and I hope it's not just a placeholder feature. This was what was holding Wipeout back. Didn't you hate when you were last place and you got the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed mines? Or when you got the quake while at the head of the pack? Sure, 2048 lets you distinguish between offensive and defensive pickups, but these subsets were still random. No more random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t here, it seems. If you want to see how much this impacts this kind of combat racing games, go play Blur on hard (an awesome and underrated game, by the way). That one opened my eyes. Leave the random nonsense ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to Mario Kart.TL;DR: I didn't even cared to look at the feature list at this stage of development, I'm a WipEout fan and I'm glad to throw these developers some money so they keep WipEout's spirit alive. But If you're not a diehard, consider waiting a bit more until more features have been implemented (or buy it and leave it in your play-it-later list). What's here, shows promise.

Early Access Review
								Edit: 21/04/16 look at the bottom fro an updated prespective There is a method to getting early access done correctly. Well there is generally a method to get a game made correctly and efficently. R8 games have nailed it.Formula fusion has used the correct method getting a very solid foundation, they have great ai(albeit a bit hard for a rusty ag racer), working races, a stable engine, solid performance etc. Well what does that mean, it means you can skip that whole buggy mess phase and move straight along into throwing in more and more content knowing that your game will handle it fairly well, of course more work will be needed but organisation and stress will be lower, lets give an example, dirt rally built a foundation, launched with little content and people were confused, its been 4 or so months since that game came into early access and its doubled in content. I see the same with this game.As it stands there isnt a lot of content, there isnt a whole lot of anything to do apart from race or time attack with the single vehicle and track. Its closer to a tech demo then anything, its not worth £20 as it stands however it works and the devs are close to the community, they take everything we ask and provide some form of response telling us whats possible and what isnt. This could be a gamble at the moment but r8 games nailed it with the wipeout games but their legends have come to an end and in its place we receive what the devs believe is going to be the ultimate anti gravity racer. Time will truely tell if that is possible for now out of sheer trust regarding past titles ill recommend this.Edit: So its nearly been a year since this came out for £20, now reduced to £15. What have see got, next to nothing and the game full content roster can be seen within 15 minutes, there is barely anything after a year and its a massive disappointment. Therefore i resent my judgement and no longer recommend this game.			",287,101,36,76,28,0,27

Early Access Review
								*03/14/2017 UpdateGave the game another shot after a few months and the controls are still horrid. No matter what I did to try and compensate...nada. Hitting the walls should not be a feature. I've been playing WipeOut since the original on PS1. When there wasn't analog controls and gamers had to drive with the Dpad. So I'm not unfamiliar with trial and error and ""getting used to"" a bad setup. But it's 2017, not 1996. The controls are too loose making it hard to keep a racing line and it's made worse because some tracks have really narrow sections that you hit at high speed. How the hell are we supposed to navigate those with these controls? WipeOut was a source of pride for many fans because of the developed ability to race at high speeds on extreme tracks and still achieve perfect laps. I have not been able to get ONE perfect lap since I've started playing Formula Fusion. I played WipeOut 2048 yesterday after not playing it for a few months and got 4 in the first 3 races. That's the barometer. If no one can get a perfect lap at the highest speeds in the easier track in Formula Fusion, then the controls are trash and need to be updated. *08/28/2016 Update. I just spend a couple of hours with the latest update. Formula Fusion is better than it was prior to the update, but I still can't recommend it for many of the same reasons listed below. The controls are the biggest problem. I challenge anyone to get a perfect lap with a record setting time on Mannahatta or Atlas or any track for that matter. Niagara is the only track that gives wide enough track width to get a feel of what Formula Fusion could be but the controls cause problems even there. Why the fetish for insanely narrow tracks at high speed with controls that make it impossible to navigate without hitting the walls? I even saw the computer zig zagging on straights as if the AI was trying to come to grips with the car. I couldn't even play this in first person (how I normally like to play) because the controls are unwieldy causing the same zig zagging motion trying to keep straight. I went back last night into this morning and played WipeOut HD, WipeOut Pulse and WipeOut 2048...on VITA no less and it's not just me. I can still play those games and do extremely well. So yeah, is Formula Fusion better than it was? Sure. But instead of being godawful, it's just bad now. Graphics are still excellent, the game runs well as I was able to run it in 1080p and even 3000x2000 without any issues. The art direction is there. But the music still sucks and the track design doesn't live up to the WipeOut series Formula Fusion wants to be. Even the old PSP versions are better. The potential is still there but at this point it's going to take a Herculean effort for Formula Fusion to be a WipeOut alternative. As I mentioned, I challenge anyone to race a perfect lap with a good time or high placement in a race on any track in this game. I could do this on many tracks in the WipeOut games I mentioned including Sebenco Climb, Sol 2 and UberMall. I have never been able to do this on any track thus far in Formula Fusion.*Original ReviewI can not recommend this game at this stage. Yes, the graphics are good but  the controls...OMG the controls. The controls ultimately killed the experience for me, made worse by bad track design and terrible music. The videos looked so promising.... The physics of the cars are so floaty that it's far too easy to oversteer and understeer resulting in a zig zag motion as you fight to control the car, even on straights. Mind you, I'm no rookie to futuristic racers. I've been a WipeOut fan since the original in 1995. I've been a F-Zero fan since it's debut in the early 90s. I even earned the Platinum Trophy in WipeOut 2048 even though it is capped at 30 frames per second, the controls are a bit weird and the online is terrible. If members of the now defunct Studio Liverpool aka Psygnosis from the Amiga glory days, are responsible for Formula Fusion, then why are the controls so bad even at this stage? Why are other great concepts from WipeOut not present here? A tell tale sign of bad controls are in the dismal New York track. One car width lanes at high speed but you absolutely can not avoid hitting walls every 3 seconds. Forget about actually competing with the other cars or getting a perfect lap.  I've tried different controller configurations, adjusted the analog stick, used gyroscope steering, used touchpad steering....no joy. Atlas (which looks great and reminds me of Sol in WipeOut) starts off laughably bad. A really cool loop and tunnel with speed pads that launch you forward but as soon as you exit the tunnel, there's a sharp turn with a blue turn barrier on the left. If you don't brake and lead into the turn your car rides up the side of the barrier and goes off the track. With the controls being so bad, trying to actually navigate that break down and lead in for the turn becomes a clumsy practice in frustration. That's the word that describes playing Formula Fusion. Clumsy. Very pretty, but clumsy.Here's the thing though. The potential is there. As I mentioned, the graphics are good. The basic presentation is good and so much like WipeOut thanks to Designers Republic (good to see them back too). The sense of speed is good. The effects are good. Formula Fusion has the potential to be the WipeOut fans deserve since Sony gave up on it. But it's like death by a thousand cuts at this point. The little problems accompanied by the bad controls lay the title low at this early stage. I have some hope though. I just hope that the developers understand that if they design a track that is impossible to get a perfect lap on while competing with the other cars or so frustrating that it's not fun, then it's obviously a terrible track design that shouldn't be used.Another example, in the original WipeOut, if your car hit a wall even at a slight angle, the car came to a full stop with a loud ""thud"" of a sound. It totally killed the immersion and flow of the game. Studio Liverpool agreed and in WipeOut XL designed it so that the cars could glide across the wall if you brushed against them at the right angle. You could continue on but took shield damage. Of course, if you're angle was too direct then you did hit the wall and came to stop. THAT'S a awesome concept and compromise that made the game so much more fun to play. But it's not present in Formula Fusion. You can glide...a bit against the walls but it's accompanied by an annoying ""thud"" sound and with the bad controls...well it's too easy to come to a full stop from fighting to stay in control of the car. It's just so...clumsy. The game doesn't come together like WipeOut 2048, WipeOut HD, WipeOut Fusion or XL. Even the lackluster WipeOut 64 was more fun to play than this.I'll keep Formula Fusion installed for the foreseeable future to see what the next update brings but for anyone looking for a WipeOut fix, you may want to wait for an update or two or try elsewhere. Formula Fusion isn't worth the money...yet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Truly the future of the AG racing scene. R8 Games has really progressed over the Early Access period and is definetely grabbed ahold of something special in the AG scene with this title. It brings alot of new features to the table while inching closer to a very floaty nostalgic Playstation 1  AG feel. Theres enough of a learning curve currently to keep the OGs fighting for top times while leaving room for a new crowd to learn the ropes as well. The current 3 speed classes are well spaced out with the F4000 Vixen being the slowest (Best to learn the game with) and moves up to F3000 with Sabre (Middle of the road). For the Veterans and speed junkies you have the F2000 Python (Really pushes the tracks limits while also pushing your piloting skills to the max). The game also now features the start to a very robust and new weapon/shi p systems  modification garage never before scene in this type of a game. Want to tweak your AG Torque, you got it. Want to adjust your turning circle or float height/AG force, theres an option for that too so you can find the best builds for specific tracks. As for weapons, there are now loadouts for an offensive weapon and defensive weapon to bring with you onto the track, no more random pick ups, just strategy. More information on those mods are detailed in the current patch notes.If youre looking for something new in the world of AG racing and really want to test your abilities, this is the game to do it on. R8 has done a great job progressing through Early Access and is very vocal with and loves to work with their supporters and community to help shape the game with the fans and bring us all what we desire in AG. So get out there and support R8 and race as fast as you can!			",2,1,3,1,0,0,0

								R8 Games Ltd! A company whose team constists of people from the legendary Studio Liverpool! Also known as PSYGNOSIS. I love psygnosis! Everything I have played from this studio is perfect. The wipeout and destruction derby games were my favorite ps1 games.Wipeout Pulse and Pure were also the only reason I have bought a PSP.They also teamed up again with the designers republic for this game! Another studio with a crazy reputation.And because of that, I know this game will be one of the best futuristic games ever on the PC. The current state is rough, not finished.

Early Access Review
								Looks promising, but ultimately short on delivery.  While I get that this game is in Early Access, and that I did come in to the EA after 18 months of development, ultimately I do feel like I'm funding development for the console gaming community.To be fair, this will all be water under the bridge, especially if this game becomes not only what is promised, but what it is shaping up to be.  The graphics and soundtrack are shaping up to be big selling points, but hopefully as ehnhancements of the racing experience itself.  The racing experience needs to be the high-speed gladiatorial spectacle that the WipEout franchise introduced to us so many years ago.  I need to be clear to those of you who are new to AG racing - Formula Fusion needs to be labelled as a Combat AG Racing title, as opposed to Redout which for me is a Pure AG Racing title.Comparing FF to Redout, the accessibility of FF has Redout beat hands down, because the controls are fairly easy to understand, and the learning curve is much shallower.  It's unfortunate that in it's current state, there simply isn't enough here to sink hours and hours into, although I will be playing from time to time and crossing my fingers in the hope that the promises will be delivered.Unfortunately, FF presently feels sterile and empty.So the question you need to ask yourself is this, are you willing to gamble 19.99US on that title that looks promising, but has a lot of promises yet to fulfil, or not?  Obviously, I have...and I don't regret my purchase because I do believe in what FF can become.Ultimately, I can't recommend FF at this time to the wider community here on Steam.  I will however give a tentative recommendation to AG racing fans, who are curious about where FF is at, and are willing to gamble 19.99US			",27,5,4,2,7,1,30

								This game needs a lot of work.It's a beautiful looking game, and the vehicles are quite fun to drive. However, I have already encountered a bug in the first ten minutes of the game where I was stuck in the options menu (it was forcing me to select a key to bind, which was not responding correctly). The music is minimal. While what the game currently has is quite beautiful, there is not enough variety and there are only four different boards in the game. It looks like one of my favourite games: WipEout (1995). I remember playing that game when I was a young child, and even now this game gives me that nostalgia. Unfortunately, this falls even shorter than the classic. It's just too limited and unpolished to really be enjoyable. Even the beautiful graphics and limited soundtrack can't save this as it is right now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The game is currently a mess.R8 games have missed deadline after deadline and all but dropped communication with their backers (but seem to be slowly pickign this back up).Before kickstarting R8 sold access to the Test Pilot Program (TPP)This early access build offered very frequent updates (in the span of 1 per couple weeks), this has never happened. However we are given slightly earlier access to testing versions of tracks.R8Games have dropped almost all communication with thier official forums and steam group, occasionally posting thier steamapp link and screenshots to facebook and rarely though a kickstarter update.Builds are starting to come through but only on the main early access/kickstarter line.Caveat emptorEdit: Removed sections that are no longer true, may edit further based on how the current build is going and how updates continue.

Now under a different name, it has!  There is nothing a group of dedicated enthusiasts, in this case ex-devs, to get the ball rolling again and breath no life into a series.  That's what we've got here, and I am hugely excited!  Great job R8, and keep up the fabulous work.  Everybody paint the town red, the premium in Futuristic racing sims is back!

Early Access Review
								I come from the tradition of the old f-zero, then podracer for the n64, then f-zero for the gamecube, and finally fatal inertia for the xbox, as opposed to the majority of people who played wipeout, so I have a different perspective on anti-grav racers than most of the reviewers. That being said, I like this game, it has promise, but here are my impressions.I played the useless tutorial and then two practice races. I lost my first practice race and then I won my second one by literally a minute and a half distance between me and second place. The AI is clearly currently bad. (But again, I've been playing anti-grav racers since I learned how to read, so that could have something to do with it.)Four tracks is a small number, but it is early access, and I like the variation in them, so this is fine. However, some of these four tracks within themselves could use a bit more variety, they felt more like leisurely drives than perhaps what an anti-grav racetrack would be like. The airbrake is worse than useless, it actively slows you down and doesn't help you corner faster. That's an easily fixed problem though, and could help with the ""leisurely drive"" issue, since you have something to do other than push the stick gently to one side. The graphics are beautiful. My aging laptop has a time keeping up, but I love how the world and racers look. Engine effects could have a bit mor umphff, but that's knitpicky. It does a fairly good job of giving you the impression of speed. Overall though, if you want a game like the ones I cited up there and won't compromise, pass on this, it feels much too caged and repetitive compared to those, and the meager distraction offered by the boost pads won't feel like much compared to dodging trees, rocky rivers, and flying down active volcanoes.If you're a sucker in general for anti-grav (me), then this is a good buy, so I give it a tacit recommendation. And when the race is close, it's pretty damn fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Ever since I sold my PS3, I've always missed Wipeout. But, I can safely say, it has not gone anywhere.. Or at least, the developers.In it's current state, it's Early Access and some people in the reviews seem to forget that, reviewing it unfairly. At the time of writing this, I have 20 minutes game-time, so take this review how you will. Obvioulsy, it's nowhere near a complete game, so I will not be judging it as one. The controls are pretty solid so far. I noticed that the air brakes are pretty harsh, and even a quick tap can slow you down more than intended. If anyone remembers on Wipeout HD, air-brake sensitivity WAS an actual mechanic. While it doesn't look to be implemented (yet), I wouldn't doubt that it soon will be, making it much better getting in some clean laps. I read that people thought the tracks were a little 'tight/narrow' which I could somewhat agree with. I did also read though that the developers are addressing that. So, maybe we'll see some slightly wider tracks in the next build. The 4 tracks that I played were really fun. I really felt like I was playing Wipeout again. HOWEVER, if you're looking for insane elements in tracks, I don't think they've really pushed the boundries as well as they could on some of them. (I did just try the first 4, so maybe they're more 'beginner friendly' tracks?) There's still enough razor sharp turns for anyone that likes quick reflex racing. The ship selection is interesting. From what I could tell, the model for all the factions is more/less the same, but with different paintjobs. I highly believe that will change at a later date.As far as the stuff that doesn't affect game play at all. The menu is pretty simple and easy to navigate (but still has a pretty cool futuristic feel to it though). The music is rippin! I love the music. Wipeout always had stellar soundtracks, and this is soundtrack does not dissappoint.. Graphics are rad and one track had a pretty sweet rain wheater going.For a game still in very early stages of development, it's fun. Simple as that. In a time where it's raining 'early access games', it's easy to forget THAT THEY'RE STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. Some people would be happier than a MF'er to tell you Redout is a better game, and the correct answer to that is; They're two different games in different stages of development. One is mindnumbingly chaotic and one is a little more smooth. Neither is a better game than the other. Remember to enjoy them both. AG Racing is a very niche style and they don't come often. So just enjoy both as seperate games that are there to offer us entertainment.			",55,1,2,1,3,1,2

								The fist time I played a wipeout game was in the 90´. I, instantly, became a fan of the franchise. There were many other games that tried to copy it´s formula but, the never managed to get it´s spirit. When i saw that a game was being developed, i thought to myself ""I must have it"", it was so nostalginc. I become even more exited when i found out that the developer of this game had worked on the wipeout series, i couldn´t be more happier.I bought the game, had some races and, even thought the game was under developet, i could see that this is trully a wipeout game. But it happens that almost 5 months have passed and there´s no updates at all. I mean, they changed some menus, the game´s physics (which are terrible now) and nothing more. I payed for this game and feel robbed. There´s no feedback from the Dev´s, the game is basically on the same state as when i bought it months ago and I can not have a refund.I strongly recommend NOT to buy this game. There´s no development at all! And no feedback from dev´s! I payed for this game and i feel i was robbed!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Having logged 6 hours of gameplay so far, I can tell you this game is well worth your time despite being a little bare for the moment. The developers are working long and hard to bring us the next-gen anti-gravity racer we fans have been itching for and Formula Fusion does not disappoint. Be aware that as of the release date, there is only one track available. However, the level of refinement of both graphics and gameplay both indicate to me that FF is sure to be the new gold standard in AG racing games. Handling is new and unique (possibly subject to change). AI skill level varies realistically and definitely presents a challenge as you move up through the ranks. AG racing is back!

The turning system was fine I have no idea why they tried to improve it. Also, the music sounds like they paid some cheap ♥♥♥ producer with their limited funding. They should have spent their recent run in with funding on a proper soundtrack instead of screwing with the driving system.

								The Early Access release of Formula Fusion on Steam gives us beautiful demo to play, and a sneak peek into the future of an amazing looking game. The visual refinements are already in place, the sense of speed, manueverability, and rich environments are there along with a refined and unobtrusive interface.The Challenge:Make no mistake, this is a ""demo"" based on an ""Alpha build""--its incomplete, its a mere snapshot, there are bugs, and not a lot of features. Most of the people already playing it bought it thru the Kickstarter and the Test Pilot Program.The Benefits: Formula Fusion had a successful Kickstarter Prior to the Kickstarter they raised money selling early access through Test Pilot Program Many of the developers are from the former WipeOut team at Sony Liverpool, formerly of Psygnosis They have lined up The Designers Republic from the original WipeOut series to work on the visual design of the game They have lined up additional funding and licensing on top of everything elseYou already know if Forumula Fusion is ""your thing."" You can buy Early Access now, and participate in the game's development, along with all its bugs and glitches, or you can buy at release, when the game is clean, refined, and bug-free. I bought into the original Test Pilot Program and the Kickstarter, because I want to play a version of the anti-gravity reacing games I love on the platform of my choice, and not be locked into a console development cycle.

								In my desperate attempt to find any game resembling Wipeout HD I stumbled upon this game, and while it does show potential I sadly cannot in good concious recommend it in it's current state.I know early access means the product isn't finished, but this is closer to an alpha than it is anything near ready to ship. The controls are finnicky at best, everything is poorly explained, there's a company mechanic that does nothing (I guess because Wipeout had one) and you cannot upgrade anything (and if you can it's poorly explained as to how).The tutorial is broken, shows the wrong key for firing the weapons, and doesn't advance when you do.Quick race is functional but... boring. There's an online mode, but with the controls being the way they are I didn't bother.It looks pretty (except the vehicle fire which is a mess), it runs fine, but I can't in good concious say it's worth purchasing for even the sale price of $15. I will keep my eye on it and update this review if things change.			",307,54,12,18,24,2,30

								As it stands, this is pretty lame. It lacks what I thought really made the WipEout games fun: The atmosphere. It really felt like you were in a near future, deadly racing competition with high stakes. All the cool looking ships, the high tech dangerous weapons, and the smooth, fast steering of the ships. The OST added hugely to the experience, and add it althogether, you had an incredible, atmospheric, futuristic, intense racing game.I don't know what the road map is for this game, but as it stands, it has none of that. There are long stretches of road where you have no music. Just the quiet noise of the engine. When you grind against the wall, it doesn't feel like there's any impact, you just slow down a bit. Additionally, it sounds like dragging a cinder block across concrete. Not very inspiring. While the steer stays within the ballpark of the previous WipEout games, it doesn't feel as good. It doesn't feel like there's much impact, and the, as it stands, calm enivironment of the game takes away from the intensity of the games that this claims to be the spiritual successor of.As it stands, I can't recommend this. Slap it on your wishlist, and wait. I've been told by a reddit user that the game will likely have a full release in Q3 2016, because, as he said ""That's when the budget should run out."" So, hold off. Wait for the (hopefully) better experience.			",58,13,0,21,27,0,13

								The current state of the game physics feels much better than the earlier iteration where it felt on rails. Now its drifty like wipeout. The only thing I don't like is the introduction of throttle management, as I prefer tackling tracks at full throttle.As far as AG racers go, it's the best one on steam. If you want something more accessible to lower skill levels, I'd suggest Redout.			",18,0,2,2,2,0,0

								For those of us looking for a Wipeout fix, this is a decent purchase. It leans too much to the arcade side of things, though this could be solved with a difficulty option. I don't expect Kerbal Space Program physics but it would be nice to have a Need For Speed mix of realism and arcade. Right now we have Ridge Racer / Mario Kart with some Trackmania thrown in. For example: rolling gives you a speed penalty but due to the nature of the tracks it becomes an advantage in tight curves. That makes yaw less useful than it could be because there isn't that much inertia. While I buy into the game's premise of maglev technology (this is a game after all) it breaks the immersion having such responsive and physics-defying controls. The game is still in early access so it can still change for the better (and I am an eternal optimist). Here's hoping for a game that's more serious about competition.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								After buying this game as soon as it was released on EA I was pleased with what they offered, and loved the gameplay, graphics and music. Then things got very, very quiet for a while, no updates, no word from teh devs here on Steam, maybe one new map. Now it looks like they are staying in touch with the community through multiple channels, and the game is progressing nicely, updates are more frequent, we've lost a couple maps for revamped versions, and the newer tracks look absolutely stunning in my opinion.If you are on the fence, I say try it out, you'll likely enjoy it if you are even considering a purchase. The handling takes some getting used to, and it's not set in stone teh handling model won't change before final release, but I think they will end up keeping that drifty handling they have now, or maybe tighter handling for some ships, who knows? I just go with the flow, and like the game even more now than teh day I purchased it, and I was loving it then.So buy teh game, U Can DO IT!!			",469,97,57,50,116,7,61

								I'm kind of in the (really) lower spec range for this game (i7 2600, R7250, 8GB) and the game runs quite nice here (I think?) running at about 30FPS @ 720p on a normal race, save for the ""Atol"" track, which is kinda heavy (FPS drops to 15~20), so I can't just say ""oooh the game runs so smooth and rocks here"", but if you have some better specs, I can totally recommend this game and say it's just as you would expect for a modern AG racing game like the original Wipeout trilogy (which I've played a LOT)!Even though I just purchased this one now, I've been keeping an eye on the development of this game and the developers are doing some pretty nice work on it! The game is beautiful and fast, track designs are great, as the ship design! Also, it's great to see TDR taking part in it too! :DThe controls, and overall feeling of the game, have that ""Wip3out"" feeling (maybe because the developers worked in it? :P).

								Play it atleast for 2 hours. It's a hardcore racing game with unique steering.With a harder steering than the HD series of wipeout (not the old from ps1/ps2). After 2 hours i could say that i hit no walls in most rounds.Reviews with less than 2 hours are bs imo.Sure it's not perfect and has a little development team. I can understand the hate about EarlyAccess games. But so far i see constant development in a positive direction!Will update this review if this changes into a negative/inactive direction ;)			",56,6,8,3,8,1,17

Early Access Review
								Just started playing and I can already see the wipeout series blossoming in this game. I honestly hope ex-psygnosis devs are in this. I grew up with that company, and that time they forget there was only young gamers and nobody's got money. Now that we're all grown up in adulthood making our own money, please take my money and make this the wipeout reborn that was a long time coming.On review, the initial frustration was typical, though I hated it in the beginning, turning before the bends come, aiming precisely on the boost pads, they remind me the mastery I had slowly garnered almost ghostly reminiscent of the classic wipeout. I am still a fan of the wipeout series and and yes, at this stage, with 3 tracks, I can recommend it to players of the wipeout series. I can also recommend it to new players because you are probably gonna pay less before the release and I can tell you, no faster more adrenaline packed racing game is out there compared to the wipeout series and this one is steadily rising above its former champion of the genre. By this week, I eagerly await the garage and a few more tracks and multiplayer because I never played multiplayer on wipeout but now I have a chance to not only pay my due respect to psygnosis and the devs of formula fusion but to enjoy the most action packed racing on multiplayer I never did before, killing two birds in one stone...I guess it was my calling to buy this game.To you out there, the demo itself will tell you how fast this racing game is gonna be, you will automatically practice tunnel vision because the speed of this racing is like nothing you have ever experience in a racing game, but add to the fact that weapons,shields and craft cuztomization will be added later, I can only surmise how much they are able to do with this game. You can decide to wait and check it out later or be like me, owing psygnosis a fond memory i could never forget and have never experienced outside the wipeout series and pay them for being a kickass company that has restarted finally a wipeout game so badass with new graphics and dope music, they deserve the money not only for this game but for the wipeout they made in the past.Pros:- The badass music is back with more fitting genre of the century- Almost ghostlike reminiscence of the wipeout feel and adrenaline action. A speed no other racing game have ever been able to replicate- Graphics and camera effects have been rejuvenated to fit the new era- A learning curve that can be mastered enough to be not too hard or too soft but at the level you'd expect from a wipeout-like series- Best of all, I can go in and out of the game and races with a few clicks, short loading time, and quick race beginning, then a few clicks out. To me thats what I truly want in a racing game, something I can rejuice instantaneously, enjoy a few moments and leave craving for it again another time.Cons AND Suggestions (Hence a longer explanation):- New camera follow is rather misleading, I dont get to judge my path because being too left or right of the track brings your craft too side of the camera, making it harder to judge your turns as the camera fixes on the center of the track- Interface is still rather light as ♥♥♥♥ hinting that the previous wipeout game itself would be laughing at it- The hud doesnt display important details as bright as wipeout making your tunnel vision a much harder feat to accomplish. The Hud should be remade so that I can have both tunnel vision and bright details for my speed, shield and weapons- The boost pads should have variable speed boosts with different colours and please make the weapons more improved. Right now that flimsy glittering floater is just sad to see, try making it another ground pad with sticking out weapons that is picked up on path lining, like a deployable on auto hook so that the craft looks different on the outside indicating the armed weapon type and that your craft is not able to pick any other weapon. Once fired, the enveloped weapon rig should be auto-dismantled dropping scattering scrap metal and associated dust fallouts.If i remember correctly, previous wipeouts also had longer and harder boost durations, Lets try pushing this game to its speed limits, BAH! As if there ever was one....Edit Update 26/7/16:The garage is out, multiplayer is out, and 3 different crafts are out along with a new handling or shicaine based track is out (Reminds me of monaco). These are the giant features of the new update.Pros:- The 3 different crafts brings back the mode of racing you would want to play based on the track. I'm assuming one is heavy (Takes alot of beating but slower with higher handling), the middle apollo like craft (The middle craft with all specs on average with a slight speed advantage) and the lightweight (Focuses on max speed but poor handling and low shields). - 4 new weapons are out: Mines (Annoying but useful for drafting trailing crafts), Energy bolt (High dmg but requires high precision), Gauss Cannon (Your everyday minigun with more ammo and spread but low dmg), Shockwave (Front disabler that slows all crafts ahead of you at a certain range and does minor dmg)- They've removed the camere fixating on the center of the track, I can now judge my turns way better, finishing 1st on all my quick races from the get go, needn't even have to use airbrakes- They've added a new monaco like track for those handling and tank based crafts to have an advantage with lots of shicane and snake bendsCons:- Due to the garage being available, all previous max attributes including your competitors have been reduced, slowing the game's pace at starting out phase of the game- Rewards feel rather dull and unmotivational. If your not planning on higher credit stakes, either do a bet system to raise the reward or provide a storyline clip based on the track, waiting for others to finish while your craft is on autopilot can become too monotonous and unrewarding- Weapons are fixed from start to finish. What made wipeout unique was the different pickups you'd get in the middle of a race, expanding your options, forcing technical manuevers just to obtain a weapon or shield and made each race dynamic, if you fix the weapons system to a set standard from start to finish, you'd take away dynamism and repeatability for the 13 to 33 tracks you are planning making FF rather easy to get over.- As I was forced to master wipeout and the early version of FF, now, it feels the skill level has dropped. I'm doing so well because I'd have to practice turning before the bends, tunnel vision and air-drifting, that the game feels a little cheap at the moment, as though to appease me to keep playing the game, the difficulty setting is reduced. Maybe If I upgrade all to full, I'll get back that feeling of overdrive wipeout and early FF gave me, at speeds so fast, you'd be afraid to hit the sides because of the damage it might do to your craftFurther suggestions:- Do a visual effect cgi when entering mach speeds, air shockwave, shattering glass, sound dampening after sound blast- Make weapon pick up different- Make starter speeds high, and then add some more with upgrades of speed that becomes dangerous to turn so that people upgrade only when they dare and when they are prepared. Also blows up your eyes with those kinds of speed- Make a pit, every formula racing had a pit, especialy one that can blow up your craft mid track because your shields were down- Add more ramp tracks with immense heights. If its one thing anti grav racing shines on, is the feeling of zero gravity whilst tunneling through the atmosphere- Instead of autopilot, make a 'sidetracker' pick up that deflects the craft and pushes it forward when too near the sides of a track. Also have booster pick ups.			",46,4,1,5,4,0,1

								The R8 Twitter account asked for reviews. You sure that's a thread you want to be pulling on so soon? OK.In it's current state, I don't think I could recommend Formula Fusion. Certainly not over other AG racers available on Steam right now.I like its soundtrack, (Both the present one, and some examples of music to come.)Visually the game is very nice, but I'm already struggling for areas where I'm not underwhelmed by Formula Fusion.The craft designs are beautiful, but Formula Fusion deviates from the norm by only allowing one specific model to be part of a specific speed class. A nice idea, but one that leaves racegrids looking very similar.Vehicle handling feels unresponsive, with airbrakes failing to either slow speed fast enough to be used as an emergency turn, or have enough turning power to be useful for tiny steering adjustments. Airbrakes don't feel like they have any benefit to their use, I actually think it may be slightly less punishing to just plow into walls.The games sense of speed is nice, but the tracks have clearly not been designed with the difference between slowest and fastest speed classes in mind.The game currently has 5 tracks to select from, 2 of which are playable.The first three tracks, each of which were introduced in different updates, (If I remember correctly) are all far too narrow, even for the slowest speed class. The community was pretty specific about either the vehicles being too clunky for the tracks, or the tracks being too narrow for the vehicles, yet it took the completion of a further 2 tracks for this complaint to be listened to. How the devs thought the faster speed classes would be able to navigate Trans Atol is a mystery. Trans Atol and Mannahatta will need to be deleted, and Niagara will need some work before I can recommend this game.Tl;drPros-Nice soundtrackVisually interesting tracksCons-Devs need to pay more attentionTracks were not designed with the speed and handling of the vehicles in mind.

								The best way to summarize this game is by saying ""it is alright"". It's nowhere near as good as Wipeout HD, but it does fill the very small niche genre that is anti grav racing with another contribution. I wouldn't recommend this game, but it's on the verge of. Currently there's no real fun in playing; most things work - but there's no progression and the racing itself is rather bland. Weapons, despite working, aren't polished. Maps are very narrow - causing you to run into walls even when steering really well. There're also some balancing issues, which cause occasionally colliding with the crash barrier to be more favorable than using brakes. The sounds ingame honestly just poor. The music is uninspiring, but okay(many of the AG racing games are known for an exceptional musical presentation - which FF really just isn't pulling off with it's generic liquid DnB). The playerbase is non existent. The game hasn't seen updates since a while, but most updates are of considerable size. The UI is a bit clunky. The ships physics are near non existent(in contrary to many other AG racers it doesn't feel *at all* like you're floating. The ship feels glued to the track which is very unsatisfying). The good include that the maps look ""pretty good"" on average(not spectacular like Wipeout HD, but pretty good). The ships look good. There's a strong feeling of high speed and it overall feels pretty futuristic. This however comes at the cost of very poor handling(it feels nothing like you're controlling a craft of any sort) and falls flat on it's face when trying to deliver the adrenaline-rush gameplay the classics had. I'm personally not very fond of the screen shaking and overkill motion blur, but perhaps there's an audience for that.The REAL reason I don't recommend this game is for it's going to be released this year, which means it'll just be a watered down indie attempt at recreating Wipeout HD minus a real progession system. It's ""okay"" in all respects. You'll need to be a hardcore AG racing fan to get more than 2/3 hours of fun out of this game.			",36,4,1,5,4,1,6

								I remember, with a warm nostalgic glow, when I first came across the gem that was Wipeout XL a very long time ago. It was in a box of games my brother sent me, hand-me-downs that he didn't play anymore or never grew a fondness of. I remember how roughly the racers handled on the tracks, they required real control, it was more like flying than racing, and the frictionless environment would almost let you go faster than you had any business to. There was something about the game too, the environments, to me they seemed realistic but surreal, like something from both the future and the past, and the lights, it was like someone dropped a disco bomb on Tokyo.At the time Wipeout XL came out, graphics accelerator cards were fairly new, and I was always excited to try a game that made use of the new hardware. I couldn't believe the night and day difference between the pixellated oldies and the smooth high res new hotness. It felt like game designers could communicate more to the player through their graphics than they could before, that they could present the world they wanted to present as they wanted to present it. Everything felt very futuristic and authentic and this went a long way towards immersing the player.It's been a long time since I played a wipeout game, I have wipeout pure for the PSP which was okay, but not a modern title that utilized my hardware and just didn't quite ring with me like Wipeout XL, and then I came across Formula Fusion. I was hesitant at first, I've been burned with early access titles, but I saw that they just released a new update and strong was my jones, so I figured I'd pick it up, try it out for a little bit and if I didn't like it, I'd just return it.I installed the game, loaded up the first race, the music hit, the damp uneven track of New York raceway spread out before me, a familiar grin began to spread across my face. This was it, the Wipeout XL of the modern era.			",322,30,12,49,20,0,34

								Very early alpha stage. The UI still needs a lot of polishing. The game itself gives an idea of a potentially great racing game for everyone who enjoyed the WipeOut series. Buy it if you want to support the dev's work (I think it is worth it) else... wait and buy the final release.####UPDATE###9 months have passed and there were some leaps forward. The mechanics improved and there are three tracks as of now. The UI has improved but is still buggy at some points and somewhat awkward to navigate. Right now there are only two racers (which is an improvement to before, where there was only one), but it feels like the differences between the two are merely cosmetic. It still feels like there is a long way to go before there will be a release candidate and I can only repeat what I said before, buy it to support the devs, it still is an early access game with potential, not a full fledged AAA release. My bet is all those minor things will (hopefully) be gone in the final release.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Having watched this game for months (and as a huge fan of both the wipEout and F-Zero series), I had built up some substantial expectations. Many of them were actually met, which is fantastic. In other areas, Formula Fusion was lacking (which I'm attributing to the Early Access status).The game is beautiful, and the controls are smooth. The machines feel heavy, which adds an element of realism. Another realistic aspect that I'm not quite as fond of is the relatively low speeds. The game is fast-paced, don't get me wrong, but the huge environments and small tracks don't feel like you're rushing through the arena at mach 7, they feel like a speedy Gran Turismo.The small tracks. With how slowly the machines turn, they definitely need to be wider. At this point, there are some pixel-perfect turns in-game, which is a fun challenge in one respect, and a frustrating design flaw in another.My only real complaint, though, is the lack of a local multiplayer. This is a game that would be amazing pulling an all-nighter with friends and pizza. We always play F-Zero X or wipEout, but they're increasingly dated games. This would be a great next-gen addition to the repertoire. Just saying, I'd be more inclined to recommend people get it if it had local multiplayer.Lastly, I'm looking forward to new content. Especially with weapons. This is a great opportunity for some creativity, guys. Even just a homing missile would be an improvement (or maybe there is one, and I've just not found it yet).

Early Access Review
								Jesus ♥♥♥♥ing christ! This is good! Excuse my language.. but wow just wow.. it just really all came together for me. What is he talking about, you ask? Wait.. let me explain:I am a huge Wipeout fan, and a team of former Wipeout Devs are making Formula Fusion.Formula Fusion is a ""anti-gravity"" racer, you are flying sick looking ships around sci-fi tracks. So after an hour or two of playing this Early Access version (3 tracks, 2 ships, MUCH more to come) andgetting to grips with the control scheme and ship handling i coudlnt contain myself had to write this in the forum, it was just.. it was so good, but read for yourself: --------------------------I played the citytrack in time trial (manahatta i believe its called?) and i really got THAT vibe again (the wipeout vibe):the music, the look of the vehicle, the track layout, the intricate corner design, the speedpads, the battle against the time, the UNREAL graphics (pun fully intended.. ), the water reflections, the lighting, the 60 fps, the art stlye, the liquid drumandbass track, the memories, the discovery of the new, and that incredibly satiysfing sense of speed.. it just really came together.. so cool. its .. oh god its amazing, dopamin must be kicking in right now or something else.. (i am checking the cup of green tea again i had before :D)cograts to all of the team, cant wait to see the final gamegood to be here--------------------I played all Wipeout games except that on the N64 and believe me, this is game is going to be great, and even, already is. I have no doubt the team at R8 will deliver an amazing game, keep in mind this is still Early Access.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I know the pedigree well and I'm looking forward to seeing this evolve, but the market is slowly getting saturated with AG racers, while there's a lot of good stuff here I wonder if it will be enough when other developers are so hungry to release their own take on what an AG racer is meant to be. Personally I'm backing you guys, Wipeout on the Vita was sublime, here's hoping some of that magic rubs off on FF.			",62,11,8,11,20,0,11

								I can't stop playing. Please don't send help.In all seriousness, I like what I see so far. Aside from a few bugs here and there, as well as plenty of kinks to be worked out in parts of the ship and stage animation, I can say that I'm very excited for the final release. An avid WipEout fan for the past couple of years, and the admin of a very nice WipEout page, I was deeply saddened when Studio Liverpool was shut down in August of 2012, I was afraid that the spirit of WipEout was dead, and this Alpha build has shown me that it is still alive and well. This game will be great, I know it. Go R8!			",95,16,5,7,8,1,2

Early Access Review
								Formula Fusion- indie developers Kickstarter project that suddenly went big.When Sony took down Studio Psygnosis, creators of Wipeout, many fans were sure that HD was a last Wipeout game. Sometime later, a small indie devteam showed up on the horizon- R8Games. They teamed up some people working on Wipeout and some other expierienced coders. When R8Games was finally in the shape it should be, they started Formula Fusion- a spiritual succsessor of WO games with graphics made by The Designers Republic.The project might be succsess in the future, but I think it is already good in the EA state. It has it's flaws, it's unpolished, but it is a great base (a really playable one) of something beautiful.Pros:-amazing graphics, just look at it-hardcore gameplay-every class feels different-great level and complex ship design-huge potential-brings back all the Wipeout memories #FeisarMasterRace-fast, crazy and mad-cornering is challanging, and you have to learn the track in order to winCons:-lack of content (currently 5 maps, 3 ship classes, 2 types of weapons and races)-even tho the physics are better than ever before, don't get me bad but it still seems to not be quite there-optimization (especially on Manahatta)-collisions are still a bit weird, walls are gluedAll in all i recommend this title to all AG racers around the world. In my opinion, if early accesslooks good, the ready product has huge chances of being much better.			",21,4,2,1,3,0,2

Early Access Review
 I received this game for free in return of my unbiased review  Formula Fusion Note: Steam doesnt seem to record game time while offline. I actually spent about 6 hours on this game, prior to review. TL; DR I recommend this game! Navigation/Gameplay The gameplay is solid and fun. The menu navigation was swift and intuitive. The races feel like fast paced roller coasters with loops, twists, and sharp turns. I really liked the upgrade system, as it allows you to spend exactly how much you want in each aspect of your ship. Upgrading has a big impact on your ship, such as how well it handles, how responsive the breaks are, or how defensive/ offensive your ship is. It feels truly rewarding to upgrade your ship. I have one big complaint… or you could consider it a recommendation. R8 games has something unique going on with Formula Fusion, but the multiplayer is either deserted or broken. The multiplayer also seems to be a bit shallow featured. I feel if they fix or populate the multiplayer and make more competitive features and modes, it would add a whole new feel to the game. I think R8 game’s biggest chance with this game is putting multiplayer on the top of their priority. Aside from that, there’s nothing else too bad about the game. The controls are good and responsive as long as you use an Xbox controller (or something similar, I used the NVIDIA Controller). Lastly, the music wasn’t quite my taste… but that’s probably just me. Graphics The graphics are beautiful. The ship models are especially amazing. You can tell the developers really took time on the graphics and models. Each level is colorful and feels different than the last. Sadly, the screen seems to look fuzzy and grainy when going full speed. Other than that, there’s nothing else to complain about as far as visuals are concerned.  Optimization My specs are GTX 960 (4 GB ddr5 VRAM), Athlon 880K (Over-Clocked to 4.2), and 8 GB of DDR3 ram. For reference, I run Star Wars: Battlefront on custom MED/HIGH settings at about 30-33 FPS. I ran the game at “EPIC” settings and got about 25-30 FPS. I didn’t see any FPS/ performance change when adjusting the settings.  Keep in mind there are sparks, thruster flame trails, basic lighting, and some nice shadows. I’ll let you be the judge of how good the optimization is. There is always room for improvement when optimizing a game. Crashes/Bugs  I only had one Bug. When I exited the garage the game froze and everything became fuzzy. Sound continued to play. I was forced to CTRL-ALT-DEL and restart my PC. Other than that, it’s been hassle free. Conclusion In conclusion, the game is worth the $20 dollar price tag as long as R8 games really support it and do regular updates and bug fixes. I really hope they take my advice in expanding the multiplayer features. I feel a competitive multiplayer update would really make Formula Fusion stand out from all the other generic sci-fi racing games. Who knows, maybe Formula Fusion will be the first big racing E-sport? PLEASE “thumbs up” this review to allow for more publicity!

Early Access Review
								Very early alpha stage. The UI still needs a lot of polishing. The game itself gives an idea of a potentially great racing game for everyone who enjoyed the WipeOut series. Buy it if you want to support the dev's work (I think it is worth it) else... wait and buy the final release.####UPDATE###9 months have passed and there were some leaps forward. The mechanics improved and there are three tracks as of now. The UI has improved but is still buggy at some points and somewhat awkward to navigate. Right now there are only two racers (which is an improvement to before, where there was only one), but it feels like the differences between the two are merely cosmetic. It still feels like there is a long way to go before there will be a release candidate and I can only repeat what I said before, buy it to support the devs, it still is an early access game with potential, not a full fledged AAA release. My bet is all those minor things will (hopefully) be gone in the final release.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I backed this game on Kickstarter and it's great to get a taste of it so soon.This is VERY MUCH a work in progress and just a prototype at the moment, but it is very promising.At the moment you get to play a race and time trial on an early version of one of the tracks.With that said (as of 03/08/2015), if you aren't looking to follow this game through its development and are looking for a complete racing game right now, you should hold off buying this.For everyone else who is interested in trying this game out now to see what the future holds, get stuck in.The feeling of the old Playstation WipEout games is alive and well, even in this early version (although it'd be great to hear some music similar to the old games, like Xpander etc.)!

								Ok, where to begin... The game has improved drastically this past year. So many more new tracks and details that were not in when I last looked. Runs GREAT.The only reason that I did not buy sooner was the lack of tracks and controller support (game cries to be played on a big Tv passing controller between family)..... and its one of the few small issues that could do with perfecting. But its great anyway.Well done team FF; were looking forward to playing again soon.Edit.Game runs GREAT on AMD Crossfire or NVidia GPU.			",461,83,48,54,56,2,61

Early Access Review
								It is a decent Anti-Grav Racer, but i feel it's lacking a few crucial components;First and foremost, the lack of a sense of speed. Sure, it gives a greater sense than most traditional racing games, but in comparison to games like RedOut or even Trackmania, it doesn't feel as though you are going as fast as it claims.The controls are very floaty. As far as the beginning of the game goes, the craft you're started with is very slow to respond to conrering unless you use the airbrakes, which isn't practical.The requirements to run the game are a bit too high for what it is. I do love and adore the art style and asthetics of the game overall, and i could understand my old computer not being capable of running it, but i just got a new system which exceeds every aspect of the 'reccomended specs' (Except for having Windows 10 and 8 GB RAM; Working n that part next) and the fact that i cannot keep a frame rate above 20 on the lowest possible settings is making Me a bit critical. With this system, i can run games like Dirt Rally, Wreckfest, and RedOut with ease on decent settings.Overall, i'll likely come back to it once i have more RAM, but for the time being; Stick to RedOut. It's better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								(Referring to 14th Oct 2015 build)I'm going against my principles of posting a review for an early access game in an incredibly early state of development, but I feel I have to just to support the devs and balance up from the harsh negative reviews that are appearing because some people have the inability to be patient. Formula Fusion is being made with the utmost care and attention from past Wipeout devs and will surely be an amazing game once it's done. Even the glimpse you get from this current alpha build is very promising, visually, audibly and gameplay wise.To those who can't resist complaining I'd suggest you stay well away from this until a few months down the line when there is more on offer. If however you are a kind human being who is passionate for the future of this kind of racer, throw them a bone and sit tight.(UPDATE REFERRING TO APRIL COMPETITION BUILD)What did I tell you folks? :DGameplay-wise things are starting to shape up, the handling is getting closer to what the devs are aiming for and if what they're saying about the future garage implementation it will be very interesting indeed. I've been playing properly for the first time since buying the early access, having some fun going for the competition time trial, I can feel the Wipeout addiction creeping back, trying to perfect those tricky turns of the new beautiful Atlas track. Fans of Sol 2 from Wipeout HD won't be disappointed, can't wait for the return of a photo mode! Honestly right now I feel like the in-game graphics are so good they don't need working on.It should be noted too that since getting a new community manager news updates have been coming regularly, with active feedback discussions with the community, teases of future features, competitions and build releases, JOY!

								TL:DR Is not a WipEout succesor, is another un-original game that tried and failed.This game had so much potential, but it chose to throw it away. It's not a WipEout succesor, it's a simple AG Racing game. All the ship are the same in the same class, there is no diferential stats or strategy of choosing a ship because it fits the track. The weapon system is a joke and the handling is terrible, wall are also made of glue. I have been playing WipEout games my entire life so I know what I'm talking about.This game is focused of racing solely and that aspect feels awkard at the moment, I have not refunded it howhever as I have faith it will return to the right path, maybe.---Update---Buy RedOut			",132,16,5,4,5,1,5

It's still very early days for this early access game featuring just one track at time of writing, but already I can see that this is likely to be a worthy successor to the Wipeout games; In fact this is being made by a number of former developers of Wipeout so it should be. As it currently stands the controls could do with tigthening up a bit and I hope the tracks that are coming will offer more variety. But so far, so good. Here's my first impressions:

								The goodBeautiful realistic graphics, lots of different teams to choose from, fitting music and responsive controls. This game is not exactly a new Wipeout. You don't collect any weapon from the track. Before the race you'll have to choose two types of weapons that you'll be able to use after an offensive pick-up. There's also a deffensive pick-up which will reload your shields. There are also boost ""places"" on the track that will boost your speed, like in Wipeout. You can also boost your speed using a KERS system.The bad (most of which will be fixed in the final game as I guess)Some places in the tracks are too narrow. The ""boost pads"" and pick-ups could occupy a larger place so they wouldn't be missed easily. More sound effects are needed for the races. The screens need more polishing (that's not so important actually).I'd suggest this game to anyone who liked the good old Wipeout (although it's a bit different in its gameplay) and AG racing in general. Even as it is now, in this (not so) early access state it's a very good game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								As a fan of the WipEout series (WipEout HD + Fury, Pure and Pulse), this game definitely lives up to the ideal successor status. Mind you, it does if you understand the creators want to polish the game with their own view and twist. The game rapidly generates itself, it's lore and overall aesthetic world in a somewhat dim future. It is quite clear the aesthetics of the racing teams are bridging a large techno-cultural gap between itself and Formula 1. Not everything appears to be starry, spangled and utopic, however. Some tracks are marvelous city escapades, while others are industrial, gritty and flashy Blade Runner styled backdrops. The use of the Unreal engine really fleshes out the sense of speed; whether you enjoy camera shake or without camera shake, everything feels fast. The feeling of transitioning from low to high speeds is thrilling, which makes cornering all the more impactful. Finally, when one grasps the winding corriders, tunnels and corners of a track, the feeling of basic mastery is rewarding as any anti-gravity racer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								It's been a while since I've been excited for an AG game, I was a big fan of Wipeout 2097, also played 3, Fusion on the PS2 and the PSP ones.So far I really like what I see and I trust developers will fix these issues but I'll mention them anyway.From a gameplay perspective the game lacks the floatyness of 2097 which I will say was maybe a bit too floaty, something inbetween, would be ideal.Graphically is shaping up to be very nice, I like the target renders and I think they will achieve that to a degree, one thing I'd like to see in more games is the option for high end PCs to have more shadow casting lights (call it uber lighting or something) and I'm not seeing any in FF.As far as sound goes, the music is nice, but I miss those Cold Storage tunes like Canada, which will hopefuly live up to the Saturn/PC version of wipeout 2097, I'd also like to a 2097 type announcer voice in the game or the option for it.I certainly think this will be a great game there's my recommendation.

								Game is fantastic, that's all what I can say about early access. Unfortunately my machine isn't strong enough to play on even medium graphics (that's my fault).Only one downside is lack of updates. I think you said that there will be regularly updates, I can't see 'em.I really hope that more people will be interested in this game, otherwise its competetive/esport side can ""die"" fastly :(			",20,1,4,1,6,0,0

								Disclaimer: Kickstarter backer and test pilot.Being an alpha (almost a pre-alpha in my opinion) this game has very little to offer right now.Starting with the main menù, there are almost no options or settings at all.It is possible to choose only resolution (manually, which is a good thing), windowed or fullscrren andtexture quality level.Continuing, you can choose between two modes (Race and time trial), one track, one craft (with some skin colors) and two weapons (a barrier and a rocket).The game runs really good. Despite having a GeForce 740m with 1GB of memory, i'm able to run the game at 40fps with high setting. Even during some fast turns or with all the crafts on screen, the game is real smooth and fluid.However, racing is not that satisfying right now. The craft feels heavy with a horrible collision detection, and sometimes the camera does not properly follows you. Turbo pads are much more powerful than they should be and weapons feels useless (at least in my opinion). Opponents have differents AI, changing from really slow (those on the last positions) to Sonic the hedgehog fast (usually those in the first three positions), so the race is challenging enough to stay focused for all of it.In the CURRENT state i would not recommend this game if you're paticularly into racing games (expecially AG racing), since the lack of contents and a good amount of bug is not worth the price.However for being an alpha state this game looks really promising, with many changes coming in the future, support to eSports and much more. Additionally, if you're a fan of the WipeOut serie you should buy this without even thinking. The feeling, the design and the sensation are exactly the same that is present throughout all the WipeOut games.			",97,20,3,11,6,0,10

								From the ashes of the Wipeout series comes Formula Fusion.Currently, this game is in an early alpha stage, meaning that there isn't a lot of content. However, what is currently present is certainly promising.At the time of writing, there is only one or two tracks, one craft, two songs to the soundtrack, and two weapons. The quantity of such features are sure to rise once the game reaches higher stages in development. You are able to select colours for your craft, which is a nifty feature and it would be nice to see it expanded upon in the future.The user interface does require a bit of work. At first I found myself clicking on a UI element which didn't display anything due to the fact that I didn't click on the previous one, and it wasn't obvious at first glance. However once I had it figured out, it did the job well enough. The gameplay was pretty good! The turning took a little getting used to but once mastered, it became an easy task to pull off. The speed pad boosts are much more rewarding than you'd find in the Wipeout games. The in-game HUD could have been a bit better. Most of the information regarding the ship (such as armour, speed, etc.) is shown right behind the ship, which is constantly moving and turning. At times I was unable to tell how much armour my ship had left, and when I attempted to check I was often thrown off course. Though that may just me me, other people may tell you otherwise.As it stands, this game is on a good path and has tons and tons of potential, and I can't wait to see what becomes of it in the future.Good luck, R8 games!

Early Access Review
								I was curious about this game after I played FAST Racing NEO for Wii U, for which I was a bit disappointed from the big amount of glitches present in the game, so I decided to buy it to try something similiar, but different at the same time.Let's start from the game's positive aspects.- Tracks desing is great, each one of them has got an unique setting and a different kind of driving design that makes them easily recognizeable from each other. Mannahatta is absolutely astonishing, with it's rain effect and under costruction/hi-tech scenario in which tha track is installed. Atlas Torres concept is almost never treated in actual racing video games, so I suggest you to check some pics of the track to make you understand what I mean. Niagara GP track design is good, but it's a little bit naked of elements surrounding the track. An update is planned the next month for Niagara GP, and I hope for a good revamp of the track.- Ships are separated in classes, which is a good thing for racing and time trial competitions. This choice prevents a single ship to prevail on the other ones, and gives the opportunity to try different competition settings. F4000 is the main ship they're working on actually, and it feels really good to drive. The ship sliding feels natural and fun to play. F3000 is a lot faster than F4000, but it has similiar physics to the last I mentioned, so it feels a little uncomfortable to drive for who has never tried it. Just make some practice, and you'll find out it doesn't feel that bad to drive.- Game's graphics looks amazing for this alpha stage; details for the two available ships and for the tracks themselves are truly curate. Graphic effects are still a bit strange, but for this alpha stage they're pretty good. I couldn't imagine how the game would look in it's complete release.- The actual OST of the game is good to enjoy, I would like to hear something more like this in the future releases. More Drum 'n' Bass, please!- Practice Mode is good for those that don't understand well the physics of the game, making you avoid to touch walls with antigravitational waves that pull you at the center of the track. Give it a try if you just bought the game and you want to get into the game a little.Let's now talk about the game negative aspects.- As of now, there are only two items available, and you could set just one of them available for a race. They still feel weird to use, as they don't slow you down when you get hit by them; you just lose shield. I hope they will add more of them in a Mario Kart way, and that they will be revisited with the full release.- A single boost pad sometimes could give you a double boost out of nothing. A glitch that needs to be fixed soon.- Passing between two near boost pads with the ship could cause you to get a doubled boost. This compromises/randomizes a little time trial competitions, and could be extremely clutch on races when you don't except to get a double boost.- Opponent's AI is still a bit easy to beat. Also, the frame rate drops and then fluctuates between 25-45 fps on tracks like Niagara GP and Atlas Torres when AI is moving. An issue that needs to be fixed soon.I also want to talk about neutral aspects of the game.- The ship's handling feel ok by now, but it's still a bit woody, especially when you're trying to countersteer. But R8 Games is actually working on it, releasing with every patch a refreshed and refined handling system.Even if there are a lot of things to fix for this game, it's still in early access, and to see an huge work like that drives me to think at what the game could look once it's finished, and to tell you to buy the game if you like racing games.Also, there are a lot of features that are coming to the game in the future, like online multiplayer races, endurances, more items and a lot of stuff like that, so the game will have a lot to offer.If you like Antigravity racing games or the Wipeout series, give Formula Fusion a chance, you won't be disappointed once the game will be released.(This game review will be edited until the full release of the game, to match up with early access releases details.)

								I've played every Wipeout game, kinda played F-zero and Xtreme G. I also watched the arcade scene in Hackers a lot.This is the best looking AG game I've played yet.  VR support, when it comes, will be mind-blowing.  I like the graphic options that they have right now, but I'm sure other PC players will want more options.  I really like that you can set the rendering rez apart from going full screen.  If I'm not mistaken, you can enter a 4k resolution and this will render the game higher than your current res for a little more polish.  This feature will make for some pretty nice screenshots.As it is in early access, there's not a whole lot of content yet, but I have faith in this dev team.  I don't really put faith in any dev team these days, but these guys have a pretty good history.  Every Wipeout release was always extremely polished.  They have put out more than most Kickstarters in a short amount of time.  It's a shame Sony closed that studio.  It's also partly why I sold my PS4.			",391,38,7,36,23,1,31

								tl;drAt first it was a bad early access (at least if you expected same level of gameplay as in Wipeout series) but since last 2 releases it seems to be much, much better. Keep an eye on this one if you like AG racers.I am a Wipeout fan since Wipeout XL. I've been playing almost all games from series (apart from Fusion - just a few races there) and I was really sad when I heard that Sony decided to drop Wipeout project. I was really happy when I found out that devs are comming back with Formula Fusion. I backed up project on Kickstarter, set my expectations high and waited.When early alpha became available I was disapointed. Music was bad, steering was terrible and tracks looked boring. In the mean time GRIP came out and by looking at these two I was sad that devs from FF cannot deliver the same quality as GRIP team. Luckily, from last two releases (with Niagara and that new skyscraper track) it seems to be getting much much better. I finnally hear some DnB from my speakers (instead of some awful vocals and boring tracks) and you can actually feel that speed. Keep it up guys.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								(should show up as an early access review, i'm also a kickstarter backer) Ok so very much this is an early access you wouldn't usually see from developers. 1 track1 vehicle (in the lowest speed class)The weapon controls are finnicky considering you have to hold to lock the rocket on (rather than waiting for the lock and tap firing in the older wipeout games)Massive potential but i would only buy it now if you're interested in seeing the progress or a massive Wipeout fan.
