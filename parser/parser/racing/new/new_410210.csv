												This game is not worth the purchase. Even at the 0.59c I bought it for it's not worth it! There is absolutely no options menu so you cannot check controls, or change display settings or turn off the god awful music. Steering is all over the place and there is no controller support either, just the letters X and Z on your keyboard and the left/right arrow keys to move. If it was an early access game I'd say ok, it needs more work, but since this is the final product...I cannot recommend it at all. I can't believe Steam allow games like this to exist on the platform. For the love of god, run fast, run far, stay away from this game!			",448,143,68,120,123,2,113

												It wouldnt really be worth writing a review if it worked, but it doesn't work if you have a keyboard/mouse set up. Graphics are sub par and not even tweakable at all, for there isn't an options menu. Just a heads up since im the first dude reviewing this. I won't go off on losing 60 cents, this game is cheap but infinitely too expensive in theory, seeing as it doesn't work. It looks kind of fun but maybe I'm just stupid. Good luck and hopefully the dev can come up with something.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ampersand is a basic combat racing game set on futuristic tracks and that is where any praise for the game will end. I want to play a futuristic racing game, but Ampersand is marred with major issues. The only thing going for the game is the cheap price tag. Some games are worth the risk of a cheap price, but Ampersand should be avoided. Its just a flat racing game that struggles to make it out of the starting line.The worst sin seems to be that no one knows how to play the game, nor does it tell you that its arrow keys to steer, the X key to accelerate and the Z key to use weapons. Plenty of other keyboard only racing games would let you push up to accelerate or even space. While Z and X do make some sense, the game needs to tell you that. Pressing escape will close the game with no warning.Beyond the mysterious controls, the game is tough. The default vehicle sways rather than turns once you get any sort of speed, so hitting walls become common. Hitting a wall from any angle is a punishment, because you'll come to a dead stop. Perhaps a different control option to make sharp turns or brake would be helpful.Another nice thing would be to have other vehicles at the start so I can say ""well if this vehicle is too tough to steer, maybe that vehicle is better."" If there are vehicles to be unlocked, I will never see them, instead I will walk away from the game, never to play it again.Other than that, you are competing against other vehicles of the same model as yours. While you still can tell your vehicle from others since the camera only follows your vehicle, different colors would have been nice.The menu is a bit cryptic as well. Its still easy to find your way into a race. I never quite knew how clicking a triangle was going to the next race. Since the game is keyboard only, it would be nice if the menu had keyboard controls as well. Then again some people can chalk it up to ""mobile port hastily thrown onto Steam.""It looks as if there are three campaigns with what I can only guess are five events each. Three events are unlocked from the start, two races and one time trial. To the game's credit after the first lap of the time trial, you see your ghost.The next downside is that the game asks for a GameJolt account when you first start up. With this game being sold on Steam, it needs Steam integration rather than GameJolt integration. Steam leader boards, Steam achievements and so on. While its never necessary to have leader boards and achievements, if you're going to have GameJolt, you should just have Steam on Steam.When I make the car turn, the heads up display will sway with it, leading me to believe the HUD is fixed to the back of my car rather than the camera. The next issue is that the music can cut out at times or disappear entirely. If the game was fun to begin with, it loses a lot of whatever luster it had when there's no music. ""Tap to continue"" appears at the wrong times. It looks as if it should appear when you get destroyed, but it will appear at other random times as well.With all the problems out of the way, let's talk about what Ampersand was trying to do. Car combat, well racing with weapons. There are floating icons which seem to give you a random weapon. Good luck swaying your vehicle over to them. The sad part is beyond the first seconds of the race, I never saw the competition again to use it on them.You have plenty health and your destruction only means you have to respawn making it a forgiving game in one way. Then again, with the competitors so far ahead, its like driving alone. There are only four vehicles on the track including your own, but I always managed to find them again... when they lapped me.Other than that, there are zippers that will boost your speed. Good luck landing on those too. With the stiff steering, it would be nice if the boosters were larger. At my best, I can still hit all the zippers, yet never catch up to the competition, because from the start, they're already long gone. The real problem is then you go so fast that you are bound to hit a wall. I like weapons and boosters in racing games, but the tracks and racing need to accommodate both. Make the tracks wider, add a brake or a sharp turn. It can be improved or fixed, but after the heap of negative reviews, its best to just cut your losses. Be the developer that people say wow you sure got better from game-to-game or just change developer names so the taint of Ampersand gets left behind.Rather than talk about the graphics, let's discuss the trailer and the 20 wasted seconds at the start, showing something not even in the game. Its just wasted time. Watching the trailer, I'd just assume its a game about lines in the sky. If you're going to show something outside of the game, make sure its your logo.I struggle to use any game as a punching bag like this, but it feels like the developer shoveled out the game without playing it or having friends play it. Can your friends pick up this game and play it easy? The setting sells me on the game and that's all this game is. There is nothing deeper.At best this is the prototype of a game and at worst, this is a game that may never overcome the negative aspects and the developer should scrap it and make a new game.

												This is not a good game and should be avoided.The initial artwork makes you think this would be a decent title.  I loved the Wipeout games, is this a modern take on it?  Sadly not even close.The first problem I encountered is that there are no insturctions on how to play.  I selected the first of what appears to be 3 stages, got in a match against three other racers... and sat there.  The other ships zoomed off, and I was pressing my keyboard and mouse trying to figure out how to move.  I quit out of the game and looked for help, tutorial, anything.  In the end trial and error by pressing every key on my keyboard I discovered ""X"" was the magic key I needed to press to figure out how to go forward.Alright, so no controls are posted.  That isn't a great sign.  Still, now I finally know how to play.  Get ready world.... Wipeout clone here I come.Oh, no, wait.  You only can choose from one ship.  The controls are sluggish.  The tracks are boring.  Wipeout used the vertical element in its track design to great effect.  This game has only a few race tracks to try, and they are bland and no fun to race on.  And at all times I felt like I was fighting poor controls.The worst part though in this generic knockoff tragedy, worse than the lack of instructions, the poor controls, the bland music and the boring race tracks.... is that even once you take the time to really master the game it isn't fun or satisfying.  Hitting an enemy ship with a weapon does not have any sort of satisfying impact.  Hitting boost arrows never leads to those ""breakneck speed chains"" you would expect in a title like this.  In fact, at the end of the day you don't seem to be able to go very fast at all.... in a racing game.I liked some of the particle effects, and it about ends there.  This game is a chore to learn how to play, and even once you do there is no fun waiting to be had in the mastery of the mechanics.  1/10			",36,5,1,4,0,0,8

												Easily the worst WipEout-clone that came out from Steam Greenlight's but*hole since a while!My comment sounds really harsh I admit it and I'm sorry if I offended some of you but Ampersand really needs more work!First of all, the game features no option menu. Simply a minimalistic white background with triangles and numbers. I had to figure out by myself what I was looking at. There's absolutely nothing intuitive in the game. Not to mention the fact that we're obliged to sign up on the devs website before even thinking about starting a race... in a game that doesn't even features multiplayer. But the worst is yet to come...Since there is no option menu I also had figure out the controls by myself. Left arrow and Right arrow are for changing direction but what about acceleration? Isn't it the Up arrow? No it's not! Why would you use the Up arrow in the first place!? Thanks to Shinryu's review on Steam I've been able to start a race without wasting too much time looking for the acceleration key (which is ""X"" by the way).The two first races I played simply look bland, short and repetitive (be careful not to race out of the map). Thanks to the very narrow track there is simply no way to complete the 5 laps without hitting the wall every 5 seconds. Here, the steering would need some tweaking.The visuals are minimalistic at best but at least they fit with the sci-fi setting. During the race I experienced some framerate drops which is unacceptable for a game that looks like a game made in the late 90's (the early 3D cards era). But since it's using the Unity engine, what was I expecting? Also, if you use video capture software the game will freeze during recording.Overall, I would only recommend this game if you're a masochist that promote ""no taste gaming"" like me.I dare you to watch this 3 minutes video to the end!

TL:DR game lacks explaning and controls suck, i almost died of boredom getting 100%Info about Ampersand It is a racing game where you got ""some"" maps you can play (some are almost the same).  First of all the guy has an add or a pop up at the start wanting you to register at a site but 99% just press the skip.  After you have press skip you have only screen with 1 2 and 3 and thats the maps you dont have settings or anything else.  And when you have found a map you get in but you dont where the bloody controls are! You can use 5-60 minuts just trying to find the controls (ADVICE GO ON STEAM  GUIDES AND FIND CONTROLS THERE)   When you find out how to drive you also find out that the driving is just terribel, trust me if you bought the game you would get the steam cards and press the hide from steam library.  Not to be harsh but this is the truth i have 100% this game and i can say it dose not get any better. PSThis game aint even early acces and does not have any updates really.			",355,56,6,38,27,1,19

												The game bugs on second track, I go through textures or get a green screen... which cancels any chance for winning the race. The bug is unpredictible, sometimes I get a pause menu after alt-tabing back and forth to the game, sometimes it breaks for good. There is no information about controls. You have to run through all usual keys used in games to figure it out.This is a mobile port. They didn't even change the words like ""tap here"" etc. You have to use the mouse to navigate through the menu but even that is bad as you have to click very precisely on a predefined spot and not the whole shape. There is no options menu. Can't change controls, graphics, resolution or adjust sound or music.The only cool thing is an overall look and feeling to the game. It's not that bad, in fact I liked it but the glitches made it impossible for me to win, get points and advance in the game. The graphics are ok, some say they are ugly or outdated but to me it doesn't matter at all, I really like them. It's like a simple, old silly racing game and it's ok, but nothing more than ok. The glitches and the developers' lack of any will to at least make a decent port makes this game not worth recommending (or buying). I got it in a bundle 👍			",162,58,9,15,12,1,14

												I would love to get my hands on a good Wipeout-clone which Ampersand obviously tries to be but doesn't get it right. First of all the game is really difficult, which shouldn't be a problem but the main difficulty to me lies in the fact that the movement is not fluent + the game is filled with bugs. More then often you come to a complete halt even if you just hit the wall with your side or something else bugs out. One mistake often means losing the game (at least not 1st place).Then there are other bugs like my sound just dissapearing alltogether and only a restart of the game would help. The game can be fun from time to time but without any online leaderboards (at least not on Steam), multiplayer or achievements the game gets boring pretty fast. I think it's unacceptable these days for a race game not to have an online leaderboard. Overall; I would still give this game a 'mixed' rating, there are worse games but since there is no option for that I can't really commend this game, even for it's cheap price.

												This game is not a great game. There are no controls page and there is no tutorial. Every time you get a boost and even nudge the wall slightly you lose it. When I started the game, I just was clicking around until it started a race, I still don't completely understand the main menu. When I started the game I pressed every key on my keyboard until I found out that x is to go forwards. Then it was a matter of pressing every other key on the keyboard to figure out that the left and right arrows are left and right and z is to use powerup. If there are other controls or special features, I did not discover them in my first three matches of the game. If you want to spend 14 cents on a good game, buy the 12 Labours of Hercules II: The Creten Bull, it's a much better game.			",160,28,4,4,5,0,4

												This is just an awful, boring game.I hoped that this game would be somewhat decent. Hey, it's cheap, not well known. I wanted to try it out and see if it was at least alright.It's not at all alright. This is worse than most games on early access. You don't even get any controls! I had to go to the community hub on this game just to try and figure out how to accelerate. Eventually I figured out how it's the X button, with left and right arrow keys to move. The graphics aren't good either. Graphics aren't everything, especially for cheaper games. But being a ♥♥♥♥ game and not even having decent graphics? ♥♥♥♥ that. Don't pick up this game unless someone gifts it for you, or if it's on sale for less than 50 cents and you want some cards. TL;DR : It ♥♥♥♥ing sucks, don't bother with it. Hopefully the devs will make a better game. I honestly hate seeing lesser known devs not get the popularity or sales that they deserve. This could've had potential. ♥♥♥♥, if it was an F-Zero Clone I would've bought it! This is just sad though.			",232,50,2,47,14,1,29

												This game was just terrible for me. First of all, there's not much of a game. There are barely any levels. It doesn't explain anything (even controls.) The world renders around you as you do laps. LAPS. You are going in a circle and the world has to keep rendering what you see instead of just keeping it pre-rendered from before. On top of everything it's not even fun in the slightest. It's like a bad phone game.0/10 &s			",587,270,20,56,67,4,65

												First of all, I'd like to say that I love games like Ampersand, fast paced repetetive car racing games, but this one just didn't do the job for me. Esc button just does the same thing as Alt + F4, you have to pause the game and then resume in order to get out of a finished race, there is ABSOLUTELY NO MENU, NO TUTORIAL, NO CONTROLS, you have to find out everything by yourself, so I'll just list what you need to know here:X - accelerate [but you have to let go of it when doing some fast turns so that you dont hit the walls]Z - use boost [you collect boosts while driving, flashing circles on the track, and you can't even see what exact boost you've picked up, or at least I can't]Pros:- Trading cards [ONLY if you got the game on sale at 0,14€ like I did]Cons:- Absolutely no tutorial, no menu, no controls- Bad interface- Game crashes and glitches from time to timeAll in all, I wouldn't recommend even wasting your time on this game, I can't even win the 1st track, the controls and the feel of driving are horrible, get it ONLY if it's on sale, so you can benefit from selling cards.2/10, Nashud			",220,78,8,33,13,0,25

												This game has all the charm an Auschwitz Disco, the repetative and loud disco tunes echo the pain and suffering that it took to make this unholy pile of dog turds. No controls, no tutorial, no options. It really makes me sick to my stomach playing this game, I truly have no idea what is going on in this trippy mess. It took me 15 minutes to find out how to make my badly designed polygonal craft even propel itself off the of start line. After that it was a sloppy mess of no control and driving through random orbs to try and gain some kind of advantage of your opponents. I was unlucky enough to have this mess gifted to me but I beg of you do not even give this mess as a joke even to your worst of enemies, nothing is evil enough to have to endure this fever dream.

												Well it looks like a game on discountOh wait it costs 14cents? and the trading cards sell for 7 cents? and you get 5 cent when you sell one? Oh and you get 3 cards when you play the game? Oh wait i can do math that means a profit. Bought the game cause it's on sale, and you can sell the cards for more then the buy price. But now the actual reviewDon't buy this game really.It's full of bugs: - you fly / drive (or whatever it does) through a coin but it never picks it up.- You keep making infinit laps on the first race- It forces you to use the worse controls on the planet: x to go forward, z for breaks and reverce, left arow to go left, right arrow to go right? But you cannot change it.If the sales are over, then my advice is: DON'T EVER waste your hard earned money on this game!But now, have a great time selling your cardsDon't idle to long: since your electricity has to be payed to, and it might be more then the 2-5cents profit you get. And the hospital bill might be more expensive then 5 cents to when you get a heart attack from the poorly designed game!But happy newyear!			",14,1,1,0,1,0,3

												A terrible Wipeout clone. Decent music, graphics and gameplay out of a mobile game, absolutely no support for any kind of controller, and some of the worst keyboard driving dynamics I've ever had the misfortune to play with.Weapons are pretty good, although there's one that causes a wavy screen and cuts your racer's power that is very poorly-implemented.The AI is pointless, has no pathifinding ability around the other machines, and is faster largely because the player is forced to use a keyboard. The races are grindfests, since winning is almost entirely luck, but you can replay the 6-lap time trial for 3 points each time. Only 3 opponents means the tracks are largely dead, there is rarely any other vehicle around you to use your weapons on.The graphics are passable. Very simple geometry and detailed, low-res textures give it an early 3D look. The machine designs look great and overall the handling isn't bad, machines are responsive and turn quickly. Nailing the apex is pretty satisfying, especially when you have a boost in your pocket for the exit. It would be easier and a lot more fun with analog controls.The keyboard seems to like to ignore or lock input, resulting in a quick tap sending the machine hard into the wall. So you can be impressed for a while until you start racing hard, until you find deploying powerups through a turn will cause you to crash.If you crash by brushing a wall, your machine will phase through it and continue out into space before respawning.You will have more fun by running the 20-year-old Wipeout 2O97 in Dosbox, I guarantee it.

												I will say that the concept of the game has a ton of potential, it feels like a basic clone of F-Zero GX with boosts, boost panels, and weapons.However, the execution is lacking, as it feels more like an early Alpha version than a full game.Some of the major issues with the game:- No controller support, only keyboard controls. Most people use controllers for racing games.- No options at all, for binding the controls, etc.- Graphics are PS1 level.- Very unforgiving, if you hit a wall once it slows you down to nothing and you usually cant regain your place.- The physics are wonky, if you hit a boost it goes straight in that direction instead of being able to drift around corners.It's a nice proof of concept but it needs a lot more work before it can be a decent game.

It won't let you play it well, it doesn't teach you anything and also it is not good at all. Also, not good looking.The precision here is pretty hard, but even if you manage to be precise, there is two vehicles who are way ahead of you and you can't reach them. It is really unfair, you won't manage to play it at allAh, yes, if you want, X is the acceleration button, and you move to the sides with the arrows. Z uses the power-up. Yeah, that's it. Also, I don't know if you'll ever want to use any power-up, since the enemies don't ever seem to be affected by it, but even so, good luckNo, don't bother trying this game, it is not worth your time and money at all.

												I simply cannot recommend this game.This game, as already pointed out, has too many issues. No tutorial or guide of any sorts, unorthodox and uncustomisable controls, the races are too hard with no adjustable difficulty, and so many game-breaking bugs for such a small game. I like the art style and music, but that's purely personal preference. I bought this because, despite the mixed reviews, I thought it would be fun to farm the trading cards, but if you're planning on doing the same: DON'T, especially if it's not on sale.

												This game is just not fun to play. It looks alright and as far as I know the music is okay as well. But then there's the controls. Oh boy, they are just horrific and steering feels unnatural. And to top it all off, it has quiet some bugs. An example: I was driving pretty good (for what you can call good in this game) and all of the sudden I was going the wrong way. Multiple bugs and poor controls make for a pretty nasty experience. It does not lack a menu screen, it has it, but I can't find the controls so here they are:x: forward/powerz: item/exit screen after race has endedleft/right: steering ",91,38,4,12,12,1,10

Seriously, F*ck this game.first of all, i know this is a cheap game and i bought it on sale, but that doesn't make up for how horrible it is.cons:>every turn slows you down, but the bots don't slow down.>every time you only even TOUCH the border, your speed hits almost 0.>with every blue speed trigger on the ground, you will most definetly hit a wall so it only slows you down.>don't even get me started on the bugs and glitches...>the worst part? the game doesn't even tell you the controlls, you just spawn in the race, with no clue what to to.pros:>bought it for €0,14, got cards>€0,08 per card>get €0,24 back>€0,10 profitTL;DR: bad game, only buy on sale make profit trough cards ",117,34,1,21,11,1,5

												I don't know what the intention of this game is.It's not really based on physics. It's no real arcade game.Controls are kind of strange - no controller support. Thanks for other reviewers - You were my Controlmenu. A menu and Controloptions + a little helpfile should be the absolut minimum, if you want to sell a game.There are way better racers out there for the same amount of money 2/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Finally, an answer for all of us who wondered what Wipeout would be like if it were completely mediocre. There are a lot of things missing from Ampersand that should be present in any respectable racing game. Hell, there are a lot of things missing from Ampersand that should be present in any game that involves driving, period. A common complaint I hear about this game is that there's no tutorial or manual explaining the function of the buttons or powerups. This is true, and a very valid concern, but I find it much more concerning that Ampersand eschews basic functions of driving such as braking or reversing. Considering an easy 25% of the speed boosts on these tracks will slam you directly into a wall, these would have been helpful things to include. If there's anything nice to be said about Ampersand, it's that it is at least priced in proportion to its quality.			",1354,349,42,84,95,8,80

												After completing the ENTIRE game, i can now give a review.So the game starts off with Samuel D Jenson a long time mechanic who has always wanted to race. He was so sick of being in the pits of the race instead of actually racing. Well, this all changes.  On Febuary 26th 2094 Sam gets his big break. in the middle of the Spacetona 500, sponsored by Sprint and Can-Am, the driver experiences some heartbreaking tragedy as his grandmother passes away and is announced over the comms inside the ship. Feeling undetermined he pulls into the pits and resignes as driver for the m&m's car number 18. As the crew and managers scramble to find someone you volenter as the driver, and is accepted. Now the game starts when you are thrown into the race and you end up winning. 3 weeks later you find out the driver has killed himself.After the amazing proformance you are premoted to the driver of the m&m's car, the most laughed at and least winning car. As you do more races and earn a reputation as the saviour of m&m's, you start to get new cars and even get invited to the Sprint Galactic Cup, the most prestigious racing championship of them all.Overall the controls are well explained and well mapped, the graphics made me think i was actually there, and finally the story was so well written it was the first game to ever make me cry.Overall rating 9/11 Loved it.None of this actually happens however and this game is ♥♥♥♥ 9/11			",22,3,1,3,6,1,2

												A fun game with your stats affecting not only the choices available to you, but also the outcomes of your choices (for example, an exchange between two characters might change depending on if your character is brash or more calculative). It's not a game, it's a story, however, it does sport stats that you have to manage and take into consideration as you play. So if you don't like stories to begin with, obviously your time would be better spent elswhere. Definently need to read the book before playing this. Thankfully, it's available here on steam!

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is one of those games that you should avoid.Interface/Menu/SettingsNone.  No options available.About the game.Ai is almost impossible to beat. It's some kind of bad race game.. The ai seems to be always faster than you are and the controls are really bad. There are some power-ups in the game, but why would it matter if you can't reach the Ai anyway.Level design is bad and looks stale.Ship movement and steering looks simple and bad.Bad Controls.Soundtrack is awful.No instructions.No tutorial.No Manual.Other things.You are able to register to get some thropies and other things. This is optional and not necessary.Good thing it is totally worth registering to something when a game like this is terrible.-------------------I Give this game a 1/10			",462,169,6,45,48,1,62

And you can't even brake!Even worst, the game's description lies!""★A variety of craft to choose from, with varying stats and abilities.""There's only 4, and they all feel almost exactly the same, except one just doesn't turn very fast.★Race on futuristic tracks with ultra realistic vehicles.I didn't know ""ultra realistic vehicles"" didn't have brakes.★Furiously fast paced racing with awesome vehicles designed with unprecedented precision.Isn't fast at all, because even when you do hit a good speed, there's a crazy-♥♥♥ sharp turn which you can't even slow down to pass well enough. And you won't even see it coming because this game has the render distance of a Nintendo DS Lite. In fact, screw that, it's got worse render distance than short-sighted person.

												Never before have I played a game as amazing as this one. It starts off with a clear tutorial that is loads of fun, and then launches into arcade gameplay that sets the bar for every game like it. Not only does this game give F-Zero AX a run for its money, but it also single-handedly made me stop playing every other game I owned. I cannot recommend this game enough. If you only pick up one game during the steam holiday sale, make it this one!			",241,51,6,24,16,3,22

												This game is really cool, but seriously, .14? If a game is .99 and there's a sale, it shouldn't even participate in the sale. People are just buying it to earn steam cards. Developer, think about taking a financial class. Also I didn't have any of the problems everyone else were having, so, it's a great game!The fact that they didn't tell you the controls is not a big deal, they are:x to acceleratez to use item and exit completed trackleft and right to... well go left and rightand esc to exit the game or show pause menuthe rest of the controls are all left mouse clicksI rate this game 7/10.Graphics- Futuristic world and vehicles looks amazing and cool. No typos or graphical mistakes.Music- Upbeat and fast paced.Stabilty- Didn't crash or bug out at all.Progression- Can play track multiple times to get more points.Lag- Nope.AI- Perfect, much better than me.Tutorial- No tutorial whatsoever.Controls- Not that hard to learn, but movement sensitivity is a little too much.Originality- Too many futuristic racer games out on the market.Price- Not saleable but is in a sale for a price that basically gives it away for free.

												I just finished building myself a home. I'd just been mining, and quite far I have roamed. I mined some pretty things, but I was missing something. The mobs at night were really quite a threat. Went up to me, and blown up I would get. I needed a way, to keep me safe every day.I'm mining down, not digging up. Of creepers I have had enough! I hear a noise, a hissing sound, and I am lying on the ground. I'm mining down, not digging up, just when I'm about to give up, I see that gem, I see it now, 'cause I am mining for diamonds!

												So apart from the game being nearly unbeatable, it also crashes nearly everytime you almost finish a race.There's no options menu, it doesn't tell you the controls and it's render distance is about 4 feet in front of you. It looks like trash and handles the same. It also crashes. A lot. Even if you were to beat the first level, it would probably crash before you cross the finish line. Not to mention when it crashes it flashes black and white and shows scanlines throughout the screen.So if you want seizure giving flashing, terrible steering and an unbeatable game, buy Ampersand, after all it's only $0.14.Worst $0.14 i've ever spent.

Start hitting the mines intentionally as this will be the only action you see after all opponents are 1 lap ahead.5. Feel bad about yourself again as you can't even hit the mines intentionally.6. Rage ALT+Tab the game.7. Play (any) Hitman as mass murder to feel better.8. Sell the trading cards you got from the game while playing Hitman for 5 cents/piece and make 1 cent profit.9. Feel good about yourself, you achieved a lot today! Now you can rage quit the game.10. Never play this game again if you don't wanna feel bad about yourself again.Optional step: Buy another 14-15 cent game with trading cards and repeat the proccess.10/10 would feel bad about myself again if play it 2nd timeWARNING: Masochists may feel good instead of bad!

												It's ""Wipeout"" from the PS1.  But it's a TERRIBLE Wipeout.   Your ship doesn't actually go where you are pointing.  I mean it does, but when you corner and you would expect your ship to point in that direction and momentum slowly moves you that way... it doesn't.   You still point the other way but you move weirdly to the one side. No controls page.  No options.  Nothing!    No tutorial.   The first course is incredibly hard, but it's made worse by the bad control systems.   The only reason i have hours in the game is the cards.			",494,113,27,42,48,5,84

												Very Engaging Gameplay and I indulged myelf in it right from the beginning. My advice is the earlier maps should be a more straight line map instead of a circle so that it is more forgiven and when picking up booster pack a straight line would feel more rewarding. Also having a wider stripe would allow you to perform drifting action without having to worry about ranking. A minor UI/UX suggestion, it would be most helpful if there is a bar showing on lower left corner about the speed boost. The booster package icons needed to be in different colors or else I wouldn't know what booster pack I picked up. The game has potential but for such a cheap price...totally worth it.

												TL;DR - If the ""thumbs up"" sign for the recommend option on this review means I can can shove said thumb up the developer's ♥♥♥♥♥♥, then yes, I recommend this game. Otherwise...Gameplay:I've only played a solid seventeen minutes of Ampersand; the rest is me idling for trading cards so I can make a profit off of this abortion. It doesn't reveal to you the utterly enigmatic controls: left and right arrow keys to turn, X to boost, and Z to use power-ups. You have to get ""points"" to advance to the next stage which requires placing in the top-three of a given race...which is impossible thanks to the absolutely sluggish controls. So essentially, you're grinding for points on the same two tracks on the starter grid in order to finally progress. Also, I don't know if you have to use the points to purchase vehicles, but the vehicle selection screen outright does not function. If you do indeed have to use points to unlock vehicles, there is no such indication. Furthermore, the powerups are awful; you get a two-second boost ability that does practically nothing, some lock-on machinegun that does even less in the way of destruction than the Death Star in Return of the Jedi, landmines that are more detrimental to yourself than others, a shield that breaks more quickly than your father's condom, and a rocket launcher that, surprise, launches rockets. Your ship also has some arbitrary health system that gets chipped away by taking damage from volleys of enemy pea shooters and ramming into walls--the later of which is inevitable thanks to the aforementioned wacky controls. Essentially, my most recent encounter with a red light at a main-street intersection was a more action-packed racing experience than Ampersand.Story:You are a bored 17-year-old male who watches more pr0nz than television and wanted to buy a slipshod racing game as a joke. You come to regret your ill-advised decision until you tap into your inner Jew and realize you can profit off of the transaction by selling Ampersand's trading cards and promptly refunding it.Graphics:This is a PS1 port. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.Overall:This game gave me breast cancer even though I'm a dude.2/10			",140,7,0,17,12,0,6

												This is easily one of the worst racing games I have ever played. While I can excuse the mediocre graphics and the bland music, the gameplay kills any enjoyment you can have with this game. Your ship constantly accelerates and decelerates on its own while you are holding down the X button. Turning successful is very hard to accomplish. Not even the enemies can turn properly. There are no brakes in this game and the boosts only hurt your chances of making a turn. However, you need to use the boosts in order to win.To sum up the gameplay of this game in one word, it is boring. I was fighting the controls and the layout of the track more than I was fighting against the other ships. Speaking of the other ships, I hardly saw them at all during my races. After the 2nd lap or so, everyone moves at a constant pace. No one is passing anyone nor will the 1st place ship give up their lead to me. Overall, I don’t recommend this game to anyone. There isn’t anything redeemable about it. ",74,39,3,11,8,2,11

												Huge potential for it's genre >> Falls horribly, horribly flat.  Controls - which I could not find in game either for reference or to remap - are garbage, tracks are glitchy, and the render distance is laughable.  I pray to the game gods that something great can be made from this, but it needs work.  A lot of work.  I mean, seriously, this is bad.  It should be called ""Driving Drunk Simulator"".  I mean, my gods...If you are feeling brave; left and right arrow keys turn.  X is the ""gas"".  Z activates powerups.  I couldn't find anything else...Dev, if you are going to fix it, please do.

												TL;DR - If the ""thumbs up"" sign for the recommend option on this review means I can can shove said thumb up the developer's ♥♥♥♥♥♥, then yes, I recommend this game. Otherwise...Gameplay:I've only played a solid seventeen minutes of Ampersand; the rest is me idling for trading cards so I can make a profit off of this abortion. It doesn't reveal to you the utterly enigmatic controls: left and right arrow keys to turn, X to boost, and Z to use power-ups. You have to get ""points"" to advance to the next stage which requires placing in the top-three of a given race...which is impossible thanks to the absolutely sluggish controls. So essentially, you're grinding for points on the same two tracks on the starter grid in order to finally progress. Also, I don't know if you have to use the points to purchase vehicles, but the vehicle selection screen outright does not function. If you do indeed have to use points to unlock vehicles, there is no such indication. Furthermore, the powerups are awful; you get a two-second boost ability that does practically nothing, some lock-on machinegun that does even less in the way of destruction than the Death Star in Return of the Jedi, landmines that are more detrimental to yourself than others, a shield that breaks more quickly than your father's condom, and a rocket launcher that, surprise, launches rockets.

												This game looks half decent, but there are many problems that you encounter once you start playing. There is no explanation of controls, I had to figure out that x is acceleration and z is use powerup through hitting random keys. The hovercraft is extremely hard to control; it slides around the map while the computers have no trouble avoiding walls. There is no indication of how one gets points or even what these do. I thought it would be 1 point for third, 2 for second, and 3 for first, but I got third place on the first track and second on the second and only recieved one point each time. Some other hovercrafts are locked as well as the 4th and 5th maps but I have no idea how to unlock them. The powerups are unexplained so I would just use them immediately upon getting them, but even if I could see what happened I have no idea how effective they are or how to use them strategically. It is very hard to cathc up to the computers, the only way I was able to do it was by passing them after they had blown each other up, but this means that getting first place is seemingly impossible. Overall this game could be a lot better if it was a little more polished but at this point I'm just glad I got it for 14 cents.			",161,39,2,18,10,2,26

Spent about a minute at starting line trying to find the button.Non-existent menu. Just goes straight to game. No indicator of how to get new vehicles. Just no.			",330,99,4,41,31,4,72

												Well thanks for showing me the controls! ( Not ).I bought this game because cool, its a racing game! Right?I made an account, blah blah, and i swear i was mashing my poor keyboard how to accelerate. No options, no nothing man!Oh and here's the controlls : Z / X = Does something to accelerate | Arrow Keys ( NO WASD ) = MoveSo I figure out the racing, right?Turns out I CAN'T see the enemy car(s), only RARELY do I get to see them.These graphics look trash made from Blender or Unity man, you could probably up them up a bit!Sure when I get a powerup, I dont know what it does! The game says ""Bha Shsdu"" like if I know what that means!I got this game cheap from the Steam Winter Sale, but its easy for me just to sell the Trading Cards. I wouldn't buy the game unless you're one of those game collectors -- or just like bad games.			",408,99,16,35,36,4,25

												First of all, the game's cheap. What do you expect? One simply does not release a good game for a buck. There are worse games for 10 bucks on Steam *khm*early access*khm-khm*. So we already fine with the game being bad.Second, this is a port. A bad tablet port. You can still see ""tap to continue"" all over and I guess the thing on the left is the control buttons. Ports may be good, but they are generally bad. It's so bad that it may not even start on your machine. Sweet black screen.Third. There are 66% negative reviews. Noone in his sane mind would really bother to read through the reviews of a failure. Would you? I wouldn't.Now, as you don't expect anything from this pile of trash, I'll tell you that the game actually tries to relive the days of glorious PS1 Wipeout. I never liked the original game to be honest, but this one actually brings up some nostagia. A random floating ship, a circular track and a complete lack of background mesh - just a static skybox. But it kinda does the job. So if you find out that you should accelerate on Z (or was it X?) and turn with your arrow keys, you'll be able to play it. It doesn't really makes stuff any better. but at least we turned an unplayable trash to a simple trash, which is quite an achievement.			",604,148,26,66,36,11,80

Seeing that, I already assumed I'd be using either the z or x keys. Sure enough, I did.X - gasArrow keys - steerLovely controls for a racing game, I know.

												I may be a little biased because I've never really been a fan of racing games but I know a poorly made game when I see one and god is this one of them. The graphics are subpar and the game doesn't even do anything to make up for that, it's just your typical bare bones racing game. For some reason they felt the need to not have standard controls and don't have a tutorial or even a place on the menu to tell you what the controls are or how the game works. Your car also seems to just blow up randomly I'm still not sure why. Don't even waste your time on this game even if you enjoy racing.			",213,97,9,40,20,4,24

												Don't get this, even for $.14 for trading cards; it is too much torture to try and get them.As for the game itself, it lacks polish. Escape exits without confirmation, there is no way to find the listing of controls, and it is (not confirmed) impossible to unlock new tracks. Hell, the only race I got more than one point (3 place out of 4 racers) on was a time trial.If you want to play an f-zero game, go play the real one, not this.			",79,27,3,16,9,0,11
