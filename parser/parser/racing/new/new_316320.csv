												How do I start this, well, I don't think it is a bad game... but that is based on playing half of the soties and then game crashed on me.This game is based on the Mater's Tall Tales, so you know what you are geting into, and every seems to have 4 to 5 minigames that controls nicely.The driving does feel heavy on the stearing, but you get used to it. Camera should have been higher on the moments when you drive forward in ""high speed"" ( fire figher minigames has 2 of these).Then the options... whooboy. You are only able to play this game on fullscreen and the highest resolution was 1280 x 960The audio feels like it likes to jump between low and high on its own. And in audio department, this game lacks any language selection, so only english.This game also lacks any way of skiping cutscenes, so you will see lots of them.But what this game has is save slots, so you and your friends and all kids can have their own saves, and no-one will cry about someone using their saves.BUT the biggest problem I had, was that from time to time, when opening new story, the game would crash before the cutscene, might be because I go to next one immeadetly and don't do anything before that, but it is still annoying.But is this game worth 15 €, I don't know, I did kinda enjoy it. This game is supposed to be light hearted and meant for kids, and I tell you, some kids games are bad to the core.If you have some spare change and see this game in sale and want something casual to play, try this out.

Just your typical Disney game I suppose.

Based off the movie Cars (of course), you create your own car and follow the story of Mater for the whole game.
The animations are kind of crappy but what do you expect for a childrens game.
It's local co-op, so you can play two players (or maybe even four?) on one keyboard, unless you have two seperate keyboards. Seriously, who wants to play sharing the same keyboard!?

The gameplay feels like South Park Rally with a little bit of Superman 64, having to reach checkpoints while driving although not as hard.

Very tedious and not very interesting. It's not a bad game but I would only recommend this to parents who play computer games with their kids.
