												Genre: Racing GameWarning: The game has no online multiplayer, just local multiplayer in splitscreen.The „Bang bang“ in the title of the game is improper chosen because you have no weapons or upgrades in this game – it’s a simple racing game!Also simple is the graphic… I had the feeling I am driving with toycars in a legoworld and the campaigns are really short. ;(The game is maybe funny for the first minutes of playing time but this slowly driving (even with nitro boost its still slow…) in a simple graphic world and with bad AI enemies bored me really fast.BANG BANG UNINSTALL!

												Stats (05.05.2014Player: 1 - Multiplayer: 1-4 (Splitscreen); bots optionalXBox-Controller: YesNoName-Controller: Not testedFree Space: ~210 MBIt's not that bad! But it is also not worth 9,99€/$. Wait for a sale and you have fun for some hours. Its a classic top-down-racing game. If you expect ""Bang Bang"", Items and Explosions like Mario Kart, you will be disapointed. The only thing that can explode is one type of 3 different barrels. But still it is a nice game, sometimes too easy, sometimes really challenging.About the game:There are 9 tracks with 6 different types (normal, reverse, short, short reverse, with cutoff and cutoff reverse and about 20 different cars sorted in 4 classes and for each class 5 different types with fixed stats (handling, protected (stronger in crashing and have more health points), best acceleration, best top speed, strongest nitro). Every event is connected to a class, so you have to pick one of the five types out of one class.The Singleplayer is okay, but not addicting. Just if you want all achievements. But the Multiplayer is fun! You can invite some friends and play with 2 player at one keyboard or with xbox-controller against bots.Don't expect more than a classic top-down-racer and you won't be disappointed.

												Bang Bang Racing is a good overhead racing game with major issues to overlook. The first issue is every time you turn your car, the chase camera swings to adjust. Its a gentle sway, but it often goes back and forth for the most minor of adjustment. It can be stomach churning, but there is always a fixed camera angle. The second issue is that an entire event can play as if its in slow motion when others are fine. Sometimes the slow motion accelerates to the smooth speed the game usually has. Even the fireworks at the end make the game slow down. I can recommend adjusting your screen resolution, but on a computer that can play ultra max settings on grander games, its just odd.With those out of the way, I can tell you about the game itself. The game plays great with a keyboard and mouse or just a 360 controller. It plays like a lot of overhead racers, left and right to steer with a nitro boost and you have car health. If you take enough damage your car is crippled and you'll need to crawl your way to the pit lane. You can tell a damaged car by the bellowing smoke coming out of its tailpipe. Driving through the pit near the finish line will replenish your health and nitro boost, but its out of the way and its just easier to avoid completely. Like most overhead racers you can turn on a dime and there are a number of hairpin turns on each closed circuit course. These ultra sharp turns ensure that you'll need your brake or in this game's case reverse.You compete against seven other racers in typical races and elimination rallies that eliminate whomever is in last place when the clock runs out. There are time trials where you race against the clock. Finishing in third place or higher will unlock the next track or two. The races are brief, several laps that take half a minute each depending on the track. Coming in first unlocks a few new vehicles for the current series.Rather than showing stats for each car, it gives you a hint and a description for each one. I assume a steering wheel means that its good at handing or steering. The roll bar icon indicates that its durable and can take a beating. The nitro means that its better at nitro and what looks like either a tire or a fan could mean its exhaust is efficient? Perhaps it accelerates faster. I assume the speedometer means that it has a better top speed. Wait I have that backward, the speedometer is the car better at acceleration and the wheel is the one with the better engine.The meat of the game is the career that has you competing in four brief stages that I'd call a series of events rather than stages. Each one has a minimum of five events that increase by two for each stage. With the exception of the first stage, these stages are punctuated with a final championship that has you racing in several races back to back as a sort of endurance event.The aesthetic is nice and clean and the cars are stocky little cubes that represent race cars, stock cars and muscle cars in a sort of chibi caricature form. Speaking of chibi, there are no people in the game, just bouncing heads on bleachers to cheer you on. Its a look that several other overhead racers do and Bang Bang Racing is the cleanest. Each track is beautiful and full of color. Japanese cherry blossoms on some tracks, a crystal blue watery port on another. It just looks like a game I want to play.Each track is compact and littered with things like cones, tires and barrels that will get in your way. The barrels are either full of water or tar, they'll slow your car down depending what you hit. The real obstacle is your opposition, because they all cluster together and usually jam up early turns in each race. There's no logic here, they just cram together. You can push other cars out of the way, just as you can be pushed sideways. With the cars being so stubby, its tough to turn anyone around although I have seen a few racers get stuck driving into walls.There's good use of stand and it will scatter onto the pavement if you drive through it. This is a nice touch of detail and it seems to affect gameplay. As you progress, you'll find tracks with shortcuts which is another nice touch. One thing that was overlooked is the game's snowy winter track without icy roads. It plays like every other track.For anyone interested, there's four player on the same game and it could make for some fun times if you have a big screen and enough friends to play it. If you're alone, you can always play against bots and even select their difficulty. You can play through all four championship endurance races, but if you're looking for a quick fix, there's free play that lets you select the mode, track, class, laps and difficulty of your opposition.Despite its two major flaws its still a fun game and a real toss up as to if it earns a recommendation. If the game slows down this bad for me, what will it do for you? Its only on a few early races, but those early races are your first impressions of the game.			",1120,324,51,104,96,15,167

												As a seasoned player of this game, I would recommend it as a 7/10, but it is definitely not without flaws. I'll list the pros, cons and debatable features from my experience so you can decide if you think you'll enjoy it as much as I did!Pros- 4 Player splitscreen, a rarity on PC. I spent most of my time playing this mode.- Simple and yet brilliantly original car damage/pit stop system- Good variety of tracks with different routes- Car class system lets you pick the speed you want to race at- Plenty of unlockable car liveries- Each racing class has a car that is strongest at something different (one for handling, one top speed etc.)- 8 cars on track is refreshing as lots of arcade racers only have 4Cons- Computer controlled cars rely on ""rubber banding"" (If they drop too far behind they will go irrationally fast to catch you, but the same works in your favour if you fall behind)- Compatability issues, there is no guarantee this game will work on your system, I have encountered problems with it myself- The single player is a quite short, and once completed time trials, single races and split screen are the only other things to do- No online multiplayer, one of the game's biggest disappointments- No Steam workshop or modding facilities, creating your own liveries and tracks would extend the life of this game significantly- The price is a little over the top for me, for such an inflexible gameOther features- No Mario Kart copying pickups/powerups, one of the biggest pros of the game for me!- Shortcuts on tracks which you'll do well to remember the positions of, but other cars will frequently utilize- Time delayed explosive barrels, and oil barrels can be used for your benefit or doom			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best mini racing games i recently played (out of Death Rally, Mini Motor Racing and others). It has better looks and physics than Mini Motor Racing for sure. And it's harder. And you play with every type of cars in every next championship, so you have to try them all. And every new type is faster, harder to handle and master. And F1 is actually the fastest type, not some stupid BUS on steroids :)			",103,29,6,15,14,0,61

												Bang Bang Racing doesn’t want to be just another isometric racer.It’s design leans heavily toward that of classic arcade racing, uninterested the cartoony power ups and lightweight vehicles so pervasive in the genre, focusing its energy into crafting a very physical racing sensation even at the cost of neglecting everything else in the game.And it definitely shows. Bang Bang Racing’s core racing experience is tight and fast, with cars that carry a deliberate weight as you spin around corners, and aggressive AI that holds tight to the line between challenging and unfair. The sense of speed feels amazing as you slam down on the boost and try not to wreck and your newfound velocity, something that’s difficult to land when you’re viewing the game from the viewpoint of a trailing helicopter. It’s some of the most engaging racing I’ve ever had in an isometric racer, but it’s also the first and last thing Bang Bang Racing ever excels at.Though there’s a clear struggle during races as everyone fights for first, often spinning themselves out in the process, once you leave a race progression becomes hard to track. You unlock tracks and cars in a linear order, but it doesn’t feel like you’re ever advancing. Races come and go and I never got the impression I was driving better cars or racing smarter opponents from the first race to the last. The only difference between the four cups (which branch out into individual races) is the type of car you drive, but again there’s little to differentiate them by. Muscle cars felt the same as formula one cars, and as each cup uses small variations on the same courses I never had to adjust my racing style for any small subtleties the different vehicles might provide.Track designs are universally solid, but you can only go so long on a dozen or so tracks before they start to feel tired. I appreciated the small ways Bang Bang Racing changes things up between races, be it switching race modes or opening and closing short cuts, and it was never much of an issue that I was still essentially doing the same races over and over. But I imagine that’s in large part do to the career mode lasting in the range of 2-3 hours, which works at keeping the sense of repetition at bay, but also meant I was done with the game rather quickly and found little excuse to replay races over again.Most bothersome is a camera that can’t keep up with you. Bang Bang Racing has two options for this, one being a fixed camera typically from the side of the track, and a dynamic camera that stays at the isometric angle but turns to follow the direction of your car. Both are extremely problematic, the former because it makes it difficult to drive in a straight line or see where you’re going, and the latter for all of that and the added effect of being nauseatingly mushy. It pans slowly and clumsily, often leaving you staring in the wrong direction you need to drive and sliding around so much that I often started to feel ill and had to stop for fear of vomiting over my monitor. It tends to be more usable than the fixed camera, but at the added cost of motion sickness which may or may not affect you (for reference, I almost never experience it).Yet for all Bang Bang Racing’s problems I kept coming back for the immensely fun and satisfying base racing experience. That I was willing to endure physical discomfort to play it should say how much I enjoyed it, and it makes it difficult to recommend for or against the game in any large capacity. I can only hope developer Digital Reality gets another crack at it and can fix the problems present here, because they’ve got a great foundation to work with packaged together in a miserable shell.

												This may seem like another Micro Machines style game, but it actually owes more to the classic Super Sprint - In fact the whole thing feels like an update version of that arcade racer. It uses most of S. Sprint's tricks with oil slicks, exploding barrels and shortcuts.The games does have it's fair share of problems though, the biggest of which is those oil slicks and barrels. Look at it this way: you are about to win a race, you hit an oil slick, you lose the race. I know that this is old school, but it's pretty annoying and takes some of the skill from the races. Also you will notice that the camera spins around the car making it feel like a little RC racer. Unfortunately it just can't keep up, especially with faster cars which makes it precise driving difficult. Of course this isn't that much of a problem unless you care about the time trials.Having said that racing is usually quite fun and opponents race fairly. You can use the exploding barrels and other hazards against them which even things up a bit.On the whole I found that I enjoyed it more than I disliked it which means it's a recommendation from me.

												I was unhappy with it when i experienced crashes during carrer mode, making me repeat lot of races over and over. But apart from that this is really fun game, what i like is that even AI drivers make mistakes like crashing into walls when taking turn badly, spinning out on oil, or crashing under pressure from other drivers and player, sometimes they take shortcuts and in other lap they will not etc. Its great to see that, unlike in some other games where AI doesnt react to what is happening on track, even some triple A games dont have that so that is a big plus, makes racing more interesting. It takes few races to get the feeling for the camera position, speed differences from class to class so you will at the final tier crash into walls more often until you get the feeling for the speed. You can select different cars in same class, some have better handling others longer nitro boost, higher max speed etc. and you can really feel the difference depending of the tracks you are driving on.Tracks itself are beautiful, have a lot of variations with shortcuts, hard turns or long straits, and traps like exploding, water or dreadful oil barrels that bring some tactics into racing (where one oil barrel in wrong time can make you lose few places in the race at the end). At the starting line in box you can refil your nitro and fix the damage on car. While you do damage your car you wount be eliminated for it if you total it, your car will only be slower until you fix it.Too bad the game doest have online MP cause that would be really a blast to play against other people.It offers a lot of replay value and for the price i highy recommend it.

												This game is missing the joy of a true skill-based racing experience.  It has some of the most obvious rubber-banding I've ever seen.  You easily pass the lead car then it will suddenly become fast and pass you after awhile almost no matter what.  It doesn't feel like its about driving skill but rather about timing of taking the lead at the right time so the rubber-banding will not take effect until after you have passed the finish line.  The AI cars will try to take you out if you are near them, even if it costs them race position.  For instance, I was heading down a straight section of track nowhere near a corner and when I came up to another car it made a sharp left turn straight towards the wall to knock me off course. The turning of your car is so sharp and immediate that it doesn't feel like it is a real car and it makes it difficult to try to drive a perfect line around the course, which again subtracts from the skill-based aspect you expect to find in a racing game.  Also, the camera is very disorienting and probably could cause some people to have motion sickness.   Overall I think a person would be lucky to get more than 4 hours of enjoyment out of this game before becoming bored.			",677,150,37,133,104,8,146

												Bang Bang Racing is a very fun and enjoyable cartoony top-down racer with stylised cartoon graphics which are surprisingly impressive with some nice effects and a very light-hearted gameplay style in a game that doesn't take itself too seriously. So far, every race I have completed has awarded me a new car for each career event I completed as well as several game modes and tracks: the game definately doesn't seem short on content. The gameplay is fun and fast with short tracks and enjoyable racing with a recharging nitro boost system and races with plenty of AI drivers which keep the gameplay fast and competitive - but this is by no means a difficult game. As mentioned before I actually found the graphics vastly exceeded my expectations for a game of this type they are fully 3D with gorgeous cartoon-style environments and some lovely effects like the nitro boost spewing out the back of the car exhaust. I find myself coming back to this game regularly for a few races just because it is such a joy to play. Really well done.TLDR: Great gameplay, great graphics, lots of content, very fun and light-hearted and a great overall top-down racer which I would highly recommend.			",429,157,31,80,67,5,114

												I have no clue how this has such glowing reviews.The game is a mess on a technical level, it lags constantly on high-end machines and even threw a full system crash my way.This is not an isolated issue, the forum is full of people with such issues.If there WEREN'T any such issues then this could actually be a fun but mediocre arcade racing game, but in its current state it's absolutely unplayable.

												Not an enjoyable racer, not even worth the $1 I paid for it. The cars handle very poorly, computer AI is also poor (they crash into you a lot).The cars also seem to move extremely slowly, although the frame rate appears to be reasonable. Maybe this part gets better when you get better cars.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first it seems like a fun little arcade racer game. You start off slow and then it ramps up the difficulty and speed. Unlocking the tracks and cars is a normal game mechanic of racers but it also lacks a key feature and has the dreaded racing game stereotype features as well.Not having a map/course layout in the HUD is not really excusable, having to remember the tracks and half the time there are ""shortcuts"" and half the time they are blocked is quite annoying. Also, BBR has the ever so popular ""Oh you are kicking our butts.... Let's have unlimted speed boosts to catch up"" syndrome. If I'm winning by half a track it's because I'm doing well. I shouldn't have the whole pack catch up within seconds of the finish line! Whomever thought that was a great idea is the same person who loved playing Madden on the SNES cause they both be cheaters!I really do want to recommend BBR but the minor yet annoying flaws make me not want to try and complete the game.

												Bad.Wobbly camera that make you feel ill after a couple of minutes of play.Boost mechanism that annoys, as it just feels like your accelerator is continuously loosing power rather than gaining a boost.Bad AI, crashing about all over the place, easy to over take and catch then hangs around behind you, suddenly better, overtakes you then gets worse again. Very inconsistent, even at highest level.Fat wide cars with almost no physics.Overhead camera show on average only a few car lengths ahead, making any type forward thinking impossible.Meh.

GOOD GOD THIS GAME IS HORRENDOUS. The first signs of how bad this game was is the title screen. ""Press Enter or A to Start"" A? Well, I looked at it, yes, A. An Xbox Icon was next to it too. At this point I realised I should have gotten a PC Controller.Well, I started up the game and was greeted with a horrendous amount of ♥♥♥♥. Everyone knows how important controls are right? Well, Bang Bang Racing doesn't. ""They dun ♥♥♥♥ed up y'all!""Music? No. Maybe 2 tracks overall, title screen and races. AI can't even cope with the bad controls.

												Solid racing game. A decent number of cars, tracks and races. Good performance, graphics and sound. Nice balance between challenge and fun (I'm weak at driving games and I fail a lot). Big replayability as you have to achieve TONS of records. Top-down perspective is nice, but camera fails at times and makes winning the race difficult. Does it stand out?

												Fun little car racer. Nice simple controls which means I can have fun teaching my little girl to play.Really don't understand the downvotes due to lack of online multiplayer, there are plenty of other games like this with online support yet don't even have players to make it worthwhile and therefore online is a moot point. Also its not a AAA, its the sort of game you would play at a party or something simple.Which brings me onto price. That is where I may negative it I no doubt bought it on sale at some point (lot of games can't remember what I bought and when sometimes.) I don't think its Japanese price of 980yen is worth it half price yes. It is a pretty game nice graphics even on high resolution.			",626,116,22,83,64,5,126

												Graphics: Art style is pleasing and the cars look good enough. There are random slow downs however.Sound: Very very bare.Control: The biggest issue I have with this game is that the corners are not fun. One of the most satisfying and challenging aspect of racing games is cornering and this game has no sense of tight control, inertia, etc.Fun: It is not very fun nor challenging. The AI does not corner properly and goes out of the track. Oil spills in the track only hinders fun rather than adding an interesting element. This game has chance with more fun control and better AI but they are yet to be implemented.			",1416,599,60,215,204,15,271

												A surprising little game.  It plays and looks like a souped up micromachines game from days of yore.  It has lots of nice little touches like oil slicks, sand, exploding barrels.  And tons of unlockable paint jobs.  Not to mention quite a few well designed tracks with the standard elimination, race, time trial options.  The multiplayer bonus and shortcuts add to this and it's a shame more people aren't playing it.The downside is the standard rubberband AI that you get with racers, but if you've played racing games this is kinda goes with the territory.  It's not terrible with it, but it is noticeable.  Especially in elimination races.  The other downside is multiplayer is limited to unlocks, so if you plan to play with friends you may want to spend some time unlocking at least the extra tracks, modes, and cars.  I recommend this as a fun little party racer with a lot of nice little touches that nobody should be disappointed with.  If you like unlockables, all the skins/paintjobs should keep you going for quite some time.			",274,86,12,47,27,4,44

												Bang Bang Racing is pegged as a top-down “family friendly” racing game. With a similar camera angle and toy-car style as TNT Racers (released earlier this year) you’ll race with four different car classes among three gameplay modes in an attempt to earn the gold trophy in each championship circuit. Bang Bang Racing strips away things like power-ups and weapons in favor of a simple and pure racing game. Unfortunately what’s left is a rather boring racing game with little in the way of any replay value.Aside from a boost meter that refills over time each track in Bang Bang Racing is littered with traffic cones, exploding barrels, oil slicks and other obstacles to avoid. Most of these usually cause you to slide across a turn as you helplessly watch as everyone else passes you. For the most part these obstacles aren’t difficult to avoid but in the opening moments of each race when you find yourself with very little breathing room it can be a bit too easy to get pushed into an oil slick finding yourself at the back of the pack early on. The racing itself in the game is okay at best. With the exception of the final car class there’s very little sense of speed and the handling on most cars is quite bad. This is made worse with the fact that the default camera in the game has a hard time keeping up with you. Most tracks are composed of numerous twists and turns in which the camera rotates just slow enough so that your view eventually gets blocked and you’re driving towards the screen. Switching to a fixed view camera only makes this issue even worse.Beyond the game’s terrible rubberbanding, the AI in Bang Bang Racing is just strange. Sometimes they’d drive straight into a wall without even trying to make a turn while in other situations they’d navigate the track perfectly. In other situations I’d get passed by a car only to have it stop in front of me and slide causing my car to get stuck and watch as the rest of the cars passed in the time I fought with the controls to reverse.Despite these things it’s not uncommon to still have fun playing racing games online with friends. I was pretty surprised when I found that, beyond leaderboards, Bang Bang Racing has no online play at all. You can still play up to four player split-screen but the lack of online is just disappointing.The only piece of replay value in the game is the numerous skins you can unlock for each car. Unfortunately I never felt like there was much of a difference at all between cars. Despite each car having one specific special feature (better acceleration, boost etc.) I never felt like I was using a different car besides the change in appearance. This alone makes going through and unlocking extra skins seem rather pointless to me.Bang Bang Racing isn’t a terrible game but it is boring. The handling isn’t as good as it should be and the lack of online seems bizarre. The only two positives are that it’s a nice looking game and it does sport some decent music. To be blunt I’m not sure I would recommend this to anyone at all.			",160,23,11,22,20,0,22

It's a basic top down racer, plenty of courses and vehicles and it makes for a good local multiplayer game. It's a rare combination of fun and real, for example there are no annoying items but barrels mix up as different obstacles, graphics are simple without looking too cartoony and players regularly crash into each other without getting seriously punished.

												Charming little top down racing game.The cars all have their own element in which they excell.Turning, top speed, boost, etcSo you just pick the car you think will be best for the track/tournament and go for it.It isn't so that you will have a big advantage if you have the right car. The bots are pretty good racers as well.Sadly this game is pretty short. So pick it up when it is on sale.			",557,144,16,72,32,2,50

												I found it quite good, the Graphics are nice, smooth and crisp.  The cars handle as well as can be expected for an arcade game.the boost as usual only seems to be good when you are not winning, and the catch up handicap is a pain, you can be half a lap ahead on the last lap, then al of a sudden, the computers are right behind you.Bought it on the weeklong deal for £1.19, so Im happy, and at that price I would get it and not worry about the price			",1160,499,47,152,154,16,200

												Bang Bang Racing is a distinct arcade game focusing not only on the speed but also on the technical driving skills. The very intuitive control system and the exciting tracks provide endless fun for everyone in the family.Bang Bang Racing delivers fast-paced racing around every corner and down every straight. Drive high-speed, pumped-up racing cars through cones, tires and exploding barrels! Be one step ahead of your competitors, finding shortcuts, repairing your car in the pit lane, and dominating your opponents from the top-down view.			",1115,462,53,160,159,14,251

												A fun little mini racing game with cute graphics and good music!Don't mistake me, it has some serious flaws:* Track design is explicitly created to punish skilled and experienced racers as hazards are placed directly in the best line for many turns* The camera swings around behind your car, and it only gets worse as you ascend in the classes, because higher speed makes it swing around more violently forcing you to rely more or less on perfect track memorization (as you can't see where you're going)* Admittedly I did not get into the higher classes, but the AI cars more or less already became completely irrelevant in Class II and I imagine in Class III they're pointless because they seem to use the same AI and can't really handle the performance of the Class II carsHOWEVER! It works very well, performance is great even on Intel HD Graphics, and honestly the UI and overall design are very charming. The driving mechanics are fun and well-implemented; while drifting isn't that useful in the first class, it becomes a big deal (expectedly, given what the class is) when you get to Class II. Like most racing games, the car with the bonus top speed is the best car in any given class, so once you unlock that there's not much point in using any other car in that class.Overall I won't give it a global recommendation, but for anyone who wants to casually play a racing game that harkens back to the SNES but with the visual polish we expect in 2011 (the year the game was released) it delivers!

												Game is intense! I'm not usually a fan of this type of game, but Mini Motor Racing was fun on mobile. This is basically that on steroids. You'll get hooked as you upgrade all the way to F1 level. Graphics aren't mind blowing but still look great and the sounds are good and the background music doesn't get too intrusive. My only gripe would be the AI, which seems to be a little hit and miss and the control style takes getting used to and makes it probably not as suitable for kids.			",244,75,19,7,13,5,24

Bang Bang Racing!This really is the most fun I've had with a chibi racer since the original Mario Kart. This has to be the best top down racer on any platform.If you're into racing games in any way shape or form you should at the very least check out the demo, you might just find that you love this game as much as I do (it's absolutely superb).
