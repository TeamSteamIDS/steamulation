								Overall, it is a very decent vehicle combat game. If you have ever played hot wheels velocity x back in the day you pretty much know what you are kinda in for. :Pros1.Customization is pretty dang good for a 10 dollar game2.As they say in the trailer, plenty of cars3.Driving is pretty decent, what you would expect out of a twisted metal-like game.4.Maps are pretty well done. cliche but well done.:Cons1:The developers need to reach out to streamers or advertise better, because this game is pretty much dead. which is sad because this project has ALOT going for it.2:Sound effects are very 90's and should be replaced with things less annoying (besides the braking screetch, thats 10/10)3:The vehicle parts and such are a bit too expensive. I would lower them down a bit4:We need more weapons you russian.			",212,27,27,27,45,4,25

								Pros:1) Price. Very cheap for this type of game.2) Size. Client weight is like 500 mb, works for my macbook air 128gb, which is not always the case.3) Gameplay. No lags, always have more than 50 FPS even in 5 vs 5 battles.4) Rich customization. you can definitely make your car unique with different colors, prints and body-parts.Cons:1) Sometimes when you go to play there are very few players online. Consider some more ads to get more players, devs pls.Overall  i liked this game and will follow it until full-release. Hope developers will make the game even better.			",2,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great Idea for a game but in it's current stage I admit that I'm somewhat disappointed with a few problem areas which makes it a bit more difficult to fully recommend but at the current asking price to help pay for development and seeing the devs comment and respond about things they are working on proactively I'd say it's well worth it but, just know you'll need some friends to play with or come online later at night when there's a higher chance of more activity online. Additionally, from what I have played it's a blast when you find people to play with online toward the evening time or so I was lucky enough for it anyhow. Also, I am really hoping for some good improvements to be added over time to make it even better and then it'll pick up speed I think.It seems like the closest thing to twisted metal and vigilante 8 that you can get right now and it could go far if some things are changed, added, and fixed.+PROS+1 - colorful fun artstyle2 - a few weapon types to use during battle (your weapon pickups laying around the map)3 - fun online battles when it's working and players are online-CONS-1 - just bought it for the heck of it and there's virtually nobody online2 - needs controller support3 - needs bots 4 - needs singleplayer mode (vs bots and for offline reasons)5 - weapon pickups need to be actual weapon pick ups and not based on the vehicle mount which kinda sucks becaus it's always just whatever you have mounted even though they're laying around on the map which is rather contracting similar to other games that fail at car combat6 - mounted weapons need to be mounted when picked up in different spots and only machine gun should be mounted on top if anything to change it up a bit which is too cliche to other's that failed at this instead of being unique like twisted metal 7 - game crashed on me twice already after just getting it8 - bug: lost connection to server after finishing checkpoint mode9 - bug: got some random error when i tried to start the game			",205,12,5,39,25,2,27

								A game for pure fun where i dont need to think. Just what I want after a long day of work. Grab a car and click to shoot. Win.P.S.Really liked the old vehicle options, vintage Porsche was my teenage dream.			",7,0,0,1,0,0,0

								First saw this game when my friend was playing it. Dynamics and realism both worth noting. The game is not particularly demanding on resources, I have an old C2D + 4GB + ATI3850 and everything runs smoothly and the gameplay is very addictive.			",10,1,0,0,0,0,1

								It is a good game for relaxation and having fun. All kinds of weapons, gear (that affects the stats of vehicles) and vehicles allow themselves to fully implement a variety of strategies and ideas.			",9,0,0,0,0,0,1

												Bought this game hoping for a Viglante 8 REMAKE.  It is VERY SIMILIAR but, I have not seen a boss battle or a 1 vs 5 cars match yet.  The game is solid, the gameplay is very crisp and accurate, the graphics are not my favorite ( cell shading) the game is worth while to play, there is not many people playing right now. add me if you want to play.

								This game is definetly interesting, but requires some better gameplay. I understand that it is still an Early Access but wait before purchasing. At the moment, there aren't many players across the world, so many rounds are empty and single-player. It might be interesting with more players, but I imagine there won't be much to do then either.The whole game revolves around a you-against-everyone basis, where everyone attacks each other and tries to complete the objectives of the specific round. However, there are currently only two rounds, which are basically Control Points and Deathmatch. The are game modes where you can go around running over mutant humans and killing them for points, but that becomes dull very quickly.I you are considering to buy the game, I would recommend that would wait a little while longer before doing so. This is because there isn't enough players or gamemodes to make the game enjoyable. The game runs fine annd the graphics are OK but overall at a slightly high price for what the game is.This is a good game at the moment- 6/10 Might play again			",22,5,0,4,7,0,3

Load the game, it immediately asks you to join a battle. But there's no one to join.Checking options cancels this so if you want to wait, make sure you're doing nothing else.So no ones around to play? You can race! Too bad nothing happens when the race starts. You just sit there.So a broken game no one plays? Sucks. Save your 10 bucks, buy some cheap beer or something.			",74,1,2,3,2,0,3
