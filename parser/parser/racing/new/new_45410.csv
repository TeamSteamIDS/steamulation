												I'd really like to recommend this, but I just can't. If you're into arcade-style racing games this is pretty fun, but be warned that there are some major flaws in the game design.1. The unlocking system is hopelessly illogical. You'll unlock events that you'll need a race car to have a reasonable chance at winning before you ever have an opportunity to unlock a race car.2. The game does not react to nor restrict your car selection. As such, most of the events cease to be challenging at all once you've unlocked a better car.3. Rubber-band AI that reacts to your score. This may sound neat in principle, but in practice it means that racking up several thousand points to earn a larger time bonus will result in the computer-controlled cars getting impossible speed increases and streaking off into the distance. This becomes even more ridiculous if you're driving a fast car with a setting that gives you a lot of extra points: You can be boosting constantly and still never catch up to people on the track, even though you'll ""pass"" them by several seconds after accounting for your time bonus.4. Broken bonus mechanics for certain cars. If your car gives you a 50% point bonus for doing something, you'll have those points added to the score as you do the trick, then ANOTHER 50% of that already inflated value after the trick is completed. With some end-game vehicles that offer 150% bonuses for drafting, it's possible to rack up 8000 points before the first corner, which will result in the AI overreacting to your score in the way I described above.5. There is *ZERO* online community for this game. As such, unless you can convince several friends to get the game and set up a server, you're not going to get those achievements or be able ot mess around online.6. Controller issues. The XBOX controller is treated in a generic fashion, resulting in semi-unhelpful tooltips telling you to press ""JOYBUTTON0"" to boost or ""JOYBUTTON4"" to match another car's speed. It also seems you have to explicitly go into the menu and tell the game that you intend on using a controller before it will respond to that input at all. Bizarrely, pause is permanently bound to the controllect's ""Back"" button.7. Engrish. A minor nit-pick, but still worth mentioning. It doesn't look like they had anyone proofread the tutorial			",296,55,8,30,21,3,38

												Ignite is a great playing, good looking budget arcade-style racing game with a few varieties of what is essentially seven tracks. First off, the game plays great, like other racers in the genre with keyboard or 360 controller support. There's a real sense of speed when you get moving and you'll feel it even more when you ignite the nitro boost!That's what makes this game, the nitro boosts. Each of the fifteen cars may have stats for handling, top speed, and acceleration, but thanks to the nitro boosts a lesser car can still overtake better cars. You can use the boost if you have a score of over 1,000 and to earn the score, you'll need to perform drifts, drafts and slam into construction barricades. Yes indeed, not go between them, it takes more skill to hit them. You run right through them and they bounce away rather than breaking, so the drivers behind you can hit the objects as they scatter. After a few seconds they respawn into place.The more in a row you hit, the higher your score. Its the same for drifting and drafting, the longer you do it without stopping, the higher your sore. If you hit a wall, your score gets reduced.Points build up quickly and why they chose to call it ""score"" and not boost I will never know, but think of having a use for a score. There is a second use for that score though. At the end of the race, everyone's score shaves time off their finish, so you can see a fifth place racer still take first place, but it doesn't happen often.This dynamic and how well the game plays really make the game fun. The computer manages to keep up with you either from skilled driving or rubber banding. It all adds to the challenge and fun, in fact I'd say the computer gets better on the last lap.If you're the type of person that prefers braking in your racing games, this isn't it. A lot of the time, you only need to let go of the accelerator and let your car swing around. I didn't consider that a bad thing, especially for an arcade style racer. Think of it more as an easy to pick up and play kind of game.There is a multiplayer component, but its been dead for years. Instead, you'll need to rely on the single player campaign and solo playing ""free play"" that lets you setup your own events.The campaign consists of seven areas that has its own series of events which slightly alters the main course by opening up new roads. Even with new roads opened up between events, it all still feels like you're racing on the same seven tracks over and over again. There is an eighth track for practice to teach you the game's mechanics, but that is completely optional.There are three types of events, the typical races against four other cars and knockout which eliminates the racer in last place after each lap. Last, but not least is ""run out"" which makes use of the game's boost mechanic by starting all drivers with a score of 9,999 that replenishes back to 9,999 with each lap. The only problem is when you run out of score, you're out of the race. Its interesting and does diversify a game that badly needs it.The game is set in a fictional city with seven realistic locales, but its sad these areas are all made up of grey asphalt, cement walls and dull buildings. I wish that there was a park to drive through or more than one tunnel in the entire game.Even so gray, the graphics are still beautiful and they do a lot with only 1 GB of file space, but I'd just rather be racing in something more exotic than an industrial port, next to an airport, on a skyway or just on a typical four lane street. The are gorgeous skies, hot air balloons floating, and fog effects, but that just doesn't make up for the areas themselves. There's no weather or nighttime races, even the fog lets you see far into the distance with no obstruction.Each event will unlock new cars or new events. There are three types of cars, muscle, street and racecar. The muscle cars have better top speed, but the street racers have better handling. As for the racecars, they're overpowered to a point that you no longer need nitro to win a race, but you only unlock them later in the game.  Because the race cars are so overpowered, the last hour of the four hour game was spent with me just scoring first place in newly unlocked races marked ""hard."" I still messed up with them, hit a few walls, spun out here and there, but it was never enough to be overtaken, even if the pack did catch up with me.There are five cars for each type and each has their own stats, but more interesting than that are the skins. These skins don't just change the look, but they entice you to play specific ways by giving bonuses. Things like 10% slipstream bonus, 30% fast car bonus, 50% drifting bonus and even 50% decline in score during ""run out"" races and 25% more score after a race.  To unlock new skins, win races with that car, although one car had something like 30% speed bonus for one skin and 50% speed bonus for a later skin. Hmmm which one do I chose?The game has a mini map to compensate just how gray the game is. Are those cement barricades blocking the road or is that still road? There are no arrows indicating to turn left or right, so I had to resort to looking at the mini map, but the only problem is the game is so fast that looking away could lead you to crash. Even with crashes and the rare hairpin turns, there is a respawn button. At some point I started to realize going into a hairpin turn it was quicker to hit the respawn button than slow down and make a wide turn.The game plays smooth, outside of a few hiccups and split second freezes in the later part of the game, but that could have been my computer doing something else. The real noticeable issue was how harsh the 360 controller vibrations are when hitting the nitro. This game has the loudest rumble effect I've ever had. Any of the cars motors were more subtle than the one in the controller. If the controller's motor burns out, I know what game did it!Is it worth $10? Yes and I'm cheap. It still feels like a good to great budget title and I'd like to see what they can do for a sequel if not have a larger budget. There's nothing wrong with the racing, its just the lack of variety in the environments that will ultimately hold it back.			",1120,324,51,104,96,15,167

The smashing into other cars is fun but the rest of the gameplay is lacking. The ""use score as nitro"" is a nice idea but ultimately does nothing much. The AI is rather weak.

												As an arcade style racing game, Ignite may hold your attention for a little while. Although too many problems push this into the “not recommended” category for me. Ignite has several race modes that take a different approach to how you race. The main piece of all modes is your point total. This is always climbing at a steady rate (or decreasing in one mode), but you can drift and hit objects on the track to increase your points and allow for you to choose between a speed boost or subtract time off your final time.I see what they were trying to do and it’s a neat concept. You could come in 3rd, for example, and if you have a big score since you were drifting and hitting obstacles, you can propel yourself into first. Or, on the other hand, you could drive fast and use points as a boost throughout the race to get the fastest time and come in first.However, this fails because of one major thing. Rubberbanding AI. If you’re ahead, the AI will always rubberband or catch up more quickly than they should to you. This is put to an extreme here. It will even make cars have a higher top speed compared to when you drive that same car. You can routinely get passed on a straightaway while driving one of the fastest cars in the game. Once someone passes you and gets a certain distance ahead…it feels like you can never catch up no matter how well you drive and boost around the track. It’s very frustrating and punishes you for doing well. The graphics are ok. The default graphics config puts you at a low resolution with no antialiasing enabled, which makes the game look awful. You can push it to 1080p (the max resolution) and turn antialiasing on for a little better experience. Ignite does support the Xbox 360 controller, but it doesn’t rename the inputs in the game. So it will say hit “JOYBUTTON0” instead of the “A” button. There is also no deadzone control, so any wobble in the controller stick will register as an input and will move your car left or right. Also, I found out that if your controller battery runs out during a race, the game hard crashes to the desktop. It doesn’t put up a pause screen, it just crashes. You can beat the campaign in about 4 hours and there’s nothing to do after that unless you’re a completionist. Multiplayer community is dead for this game unless you get your buddies to sign on. Pros+Point system had promise+Controller support (sort of)+60fps (mostly)Cons+Rubberband AI+Controller buttons not correctly labeled in game+Track/Car unlocks are not balanced properly+No controller deadzone adjustment3/10 Poor ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It also tries to be a destructive racer, which for all intensive purposes...isn't really all that destructive, your car does trade paint and you see some scratches and scuff marks on the car but it never really gets damaged to the point where you need to pit stop or their isn't any cinematic crashing that the burnout franchise is famous for, unless maybe these options come to you further into the game as more stuff is unlockedThe game looks great and runs smooth, also has achievements and multiplayer...definitely worth checking out			",260,16,7,23,11,2,15

												Deserves more credit as a budget racing game, it has really nice graphics and racing mechanics, albeit limited car customization. Definitely better with a gamepad, makes it much easier to control.What is also cool is it's unique nitro-score power, where you have to strategically decide whether to use your score (gained by hitting objects and doing sweet drifts) for tactical nitro boosts (that can help save you from crashing!) or to keep your score until the end where it will shave some time off your race (and potentially win you the race!)Probably worth at retail price, but if you pick it up on sale like me, it is a highly recommended buy for casual racers!

												Presentation: The UI is okay, it's a racing game, so what do you really expect. The UI elements are bigger than they really need to be, so the screen isn't exactly clean, and feels a little crowded, but this doesn't really impede gameplay. There is no real story to speak of; again, racing game. The menus feel a little weird, like it was designed for a console, not a mouse (though it works fine with a mouse).The game-play is just bad. All the cars feel squirrelly and hard to control. Some objects in the game look like barriers to avoid, but are knocked away like they were made of styrofoam and will give you points for hitting them. Other, similar looking debris will stop your car dead on impact, and cause you to lose points for even slightly touching them. The physics are just weird, crashing into anything often causes your car to jerk violently to the side (not spinning, sliding laterally), and at no point will any of your tires leave the pavement, no matter how badly you crash. Different paint jobs for your car affect it's performance in the races.The graphics look fine, but don't impress. Some of the scenery is relatively low-res, but you're not likely to be looking at it in a race. The atmospheric effects are just a variety of skyboxes; there's no weather at all.The sounds are basically just a variety of revving engines and squealing tires. There is no announcer, or voice acting at all that I noticed.Additionally, the multi-player is individually hosted. Hosting a server dropped my game to ~10 FPS on the menu screen (and no one joined). I did not see anyone else hosting servers.In conclusion, playing this made me want to play TrackMania again. If you were thinking of buying a racing game, I'd recommend you pass on this and give TrackMania Nations Forever a look instead; It's free, so you can hardly go wrong there.

												This is only 69p in the sale and I like it. I suspect it's going to get comedically difficult as the career progresses but I like the risk / reward of the boost system being converted to time at the end. This means that being conservative with the boost can help you win the race even if you are not first across the line. Gameplay-wise, it feels like Flatout, if not quite as good as Bugbear's classic racing games.			",310,48,66,38,15,0,13

												Looks ugly like a game from 2004.

After i wnet back al my tracks i and cars i earned were gone so i have start all over again.In the end. Fun gameplay for a simple arcade racer but old ugly graphics, untested on market and looses your won races			",107,3,18,1,4,0,1

												Graphics are compairable to a Playstation2 game from 2005, Damage model looks like wrinkled tin foil, too much bloom and motion blur, easy AI, lots of bugs. Over all a dated looking game for even its release date of 2011 (was frankly shocked it was from 2011 since it looked like it was from 2005). The dated graphics arent the big issue for me as i belive in playing a game for more than just pretty visuals, in fact it's kinda fun gameplay wise, but the real deal breaker was the fact that i spent over an hour winning races and unlocking a bunch of cars and then i quit the game and when i came back all of my career progress was gone, thats right the game didn't save so now im back at the start. This game wouldnt be getting a bad review from me if it wasn't for that.			",110,12,16,10,9,0,5

												This game's graphics are decent but the gameplay is repetitive. The tracks are boring and provide no chellenge what so ever. You have nitro boost but that about it for any kind of bonus.As you play you unlock more tracks and cars. This game doesnt add anything new to the plate. No one is ever online in multiplayer so I can never play to test that out. Im running a I5 2 TB harddrive with a 2 gig graphics card. I can run most game on Ultra or High graphic settings except this game. The game skips a bit while playing. I would only take this game for free it's not worth much more than that.3/10			",331,69,13,35,21,6,23

												When you can't even change the graphical options in the game and every time you restart the game, any changes you made in the menu reset, you know you've made a bad purchase. And that's starting with a bad first impression, but ignoring that, is there anything else to this game? No. The presentation, besides being buggy, is boring, the music is just a loop of a few notes, and that's me being gentle, I don't want to sound subjective by saying ""the music is crap"", and the races are just boring as hell. So, all in all, it's a boring game. The handling is awful, it's like in no other racing game that I've ever played, but please don't get intrigued, it's just terrible. And there's no reason to even race in this game, aside from unlocking a few cars and paints.The bugs are running wild in this game and there's no way the devs, Nemesys, are even trying to support their game. This game just sucks.			",585,160,28,66,39,4,72

												Recommended specs: GTX 970 & i7 4770kThat's my estimation if you want a solid 60 FPS.Anyways this apparently isn't a mobile game??? Essentially take the fastest accelerating car. When you take a turn you lose 60% of your speed. Turning is horrible. Essentially it forces you into a super sharp drift or into a slight turn (there is no in between).Also make sure you stay far far ahead of the AI. They have the tendency to crash straight into the wall and screw you over. I guess this is what happens when you are trying to make a mobile game and figured out once you were finished that you used the wrong language/engine or something. That or you have some Chinese/Indian developers looking to get some real quick cash.			",68,3,2,5,2,2,5

												2001 called, they want their game back.No but seriously, this game feels old, drives old and acts old. This is an example of how lots of bloom, blur and whatever post-processing effects you can think of does not make a better looking game.It took me 5 times before the game finally accepted my 1680x1050 resolution, and it took me twice to just set the controller as the device used.You might like the incredibly arcade gameplay and the usage of points either as a nitro or as a time bonus, but to me it was more of an annoyance than enjoyable. The usage of points as a nitro or time bonus is an refreshing way to race, but in the end it means that everything that is done on track is pointless.Also the game kept ♥♥♥♥♥ing about how i should use nitro. Yes, i knew how to use it but chose not to use it, isn't that what this game was about? Yet it kept pointing out to press a certain button to use nitro.Overall, it is an mediocre game that would have worked 14 years ago and it feels like they took a game from then, put on lots of post-processing effects and decided to resell it as a new game. Which makes me think, they might have just done that.			",190,28,46,22,66,3,30

												Horrible, there's no other word!!Gameplay is basic & arcade, the only way to loose is to crash into walls & get stuck several time (NO damages on cars)...As the only way to see where you are is by looking the mini-map as the graphics a so poor & ugly, so much aliasing that you cannot see in front of you...& the better, you cannot change the resolution & details as it go back to the default one at each restart...By the way by changing the resolution, you also ERASE YOUR SAVE & all what you unlocked!!! Unbelievable!!Keep the nitro to BURN this GAME!P.S....Well, when you manage to have a correct resolution by Alt-F4 the game when it's restarting after had changed settings & restart again, game is nearly playable... even if there was better looking game back in 2003...Anyway after a few very quick races you can unlock cars & some bonus that made the nitro massively ever-flowing & you can use it all the time as you receive more than you can handle...(if can stand the blur-effect of it)So the all campaign can be beat in around 3 hours without any difficulty & in taking your time...(if your saves don't get deleted)... hopefully i get it into a bundle...

												very basic racing game to be honest, nothing spectacular.it got some different racing modes like race, knock out and run out,...freeplay , campain and multiplayer.well, the way they made up the campain mode is confusing and lame. you have a race on a track and if you finish first, you either unlock a new car or a new track, you win the campain when you won on all tracks. without anything worthwhile or thrill in between.there are no real statistics while youre in a campain so you always have to get back to main menu to look them up.i tried playing the game with my controlpad, it was detected by the game, the buttons seem to work but the x-axis steering didnt, so i had to play with keyboard only. sounds and graphics are far outdated, the music is a neverending nightmare and the multiplayer mode is dead.the game is back in the steam store, so this might change in the future. (haha i doubt it) for the acceptable price of 7,99€ its good for some hours playtime, but dont expect a firework of emotions.			",2173,812,89,258,286,22,368

												Ignite is a five year old racing game that would barely pass muster on the PS2 a decade ago. In fact, despite releasing in 2011, almost every element of this game feels ripped from the Burnout and Need For Speed titles EA released two console generations ago. The logo, font, and overall UI are all based heavily on visuals used in tuning culture, and the heavy metal soundtrack would fit right in with EA's Underground titles. Meanwhile the visuals themselves certainly don't hold a candle to EA's 360 and PS3 era games, nor Codemaster's more simulation based Dirt and GRID games. Despite looking like an Underground knock off, Ignite somehow performs worse than any of Codemasters or EA's games on my computer. I can run all of Codemasters games (haven't tried the new Dirt in Early Access) maxed out at 1080p/60 just with advanced lighting turned off, while EA's titles that allow 60 fps playback also run at that refresh rate. Moving beyond the embarassing presentation, the question is if the actual racing here is worth putting up with the shoddy performance. The answer is largely no. The handling here feels most similar to Burnout among other PC releases, but I would say probably handles most similarly to Ubisoft's mobile Asphalt series in that the game never requires you to break and seems to correct your steering at times as well. I wouldn't be surprised if Ignite began life on iOS or Android phones, simply because of how damn easy the game is. You'll note that my playtime sits at 3 hours. In those 3 hours I completed the entire single player campaign on its sole difficulty, and went back and completed many of the earlier races with late-game vehicles to beat all the time trials. If you wanted to do that for every race, and complete all the offline achievements, you could maybe eek 5 hours of content out of this game. While spending $10 for 5 hours of content isn't terrible as far as entertainment goes, these aren't 5 great hours, nor five challenging hours. The game claims that players can use various tactics to achieve success, and that statement is true. The problem is that simply holding down the gas and turning when needed with the fastest car unlocked will get you victory in every race on your first attempt. The ease with which you can beat the game is a shame, as early on when you don't have any fast cars you can see the beginnings of what could be a great set of mechanics. Boost in Ignite is earned through all your standard means. Drift, draft, smash things, and so on. If you've played Burnout or Need for Speed in the past decade you know the drill. Unlike in those games, though, there is no limit on the amount of boost you can hold in reserve, and any boost not spent by the end of a race is converted into bonus time that subtracts from your total. It's a system with potential  but both the ease of the game and a lack of nuance hold it back. As far as I could tell you receive the same amount of bonus time for your remaining boost regardless of the car you are driving. This means that early on, saving boost is more valuable as a car's max speed is low enough that the couple seconds shaved off at the end might be more than would be shaved by using nitros in the race. Balancing it all makes the first quarter of the game fun and occassionally nail biting. But once you get past the first half an hour or so, you'll find that it really doesn't matter one way or the other, as the cars you are driving easily smoke the competition by 10 or more seconds even on the very final race. There is an online option in Ignite that I didn't bother trying, and every car can unlock additional liveries that provide various bonuses to the rate that certain tricks give you boost. One even offers a nice double or nothing bonus where you get 200% boost per trick, but lose all of your boost if you hit into a wall. This type of give and take upgrade could have allowed players to focus on getting through races in a particular style, but as it is, most races can be beaten with the default cars. no upgrades required. Being easy isn't always bad, but in the case of Ignite it renders the tension of racing innert, leaving you with a driving game that mostly drives for you, filled with a bunch of options that are entirely meaningless when faced with such abysmal competition.

												First the game has trouble even starting most times,i have to resart my pc every time i had to play.And after about 10 minutes i didnt want to play it all but i gave it longer just to see if it got better or notThe graphics and feel of this game are terrible,nothing looks good at alThe driving feel unrealistic and not really ever consistent,At one time,all with the same car btw,youll be drifting around fine then on another corner you cant even turn normally.And on top of that all the cars i used never felt different and i won every race by a landslideNow the race types are pretty cool but have been done better in better games,The score system is terrible in my opinion cause if you beat someone by seconds it can take there time off cause they had more points than you....even tho you did,in fact,beat themThis really feel like a cheap version of need pro street or burnout(with out the crashes),And i cant recommend it at all really,even if you really love racing games			",228,28,6,43,9,0,24

												Looks clean and nice (though a bit bland), and the racing is servicable, with the concept of sacrificing extra seconds for boost being interesting but not very well implemented. Handling is quite loose, as you drift just by turning. Overall a good game for such a small studio and worth the 99 cents for an hour's entertainment or so			",374,82,24,35,24,3,41
