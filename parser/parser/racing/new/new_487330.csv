Totally Unbalanced Review - Rating: 7.4/10General ImpressionTotally Unbalanced is a pretty cute and short indie game.  The graphics and the textures are neat. They are well-designed as well. The atmosphere will differ between each level, getting more and more complicated. There are 2 types of it: the summer one, and the winter one. During the winter one, the water has some ice floating, and the overall background is foggier. There are many squares and cubes which you need to jump on, or to simply roll, but some of them are either hidden (they will appear when you reach the predecessor of it) and some, as example: 8 squares are white. You need to activate them all to go further. If you jump the second time on a greened square, it will go white again. You will even need to jump on obstacles when you are sitting on a moving cube, etc. The audio and the music are both neat, and fit the game a lot. It’d be great if the game had diversified music when reaching a new level. The gameplay is hard, and will get you raging. I don’t recommend you to rage, simply keep trying until you manage it. As you progress throughout the levels, you will play better, hence the gameplay will get more obstacles and even other problems. The user-interface is very simple, and with no special designs. The controls are simple and easy to understand. The engines are alright, I haven’t found any haven’t met any bugs, crashes, screen freezes or frame drops. The mechanics are neat and well-designed. The game will soon have workshop support and rankings.  These 2 features are pretty nice, especially the workshop one, which will add a lot of content to the game, and the ability to make your own content. Overall, Totally Unbalanced is a pretty nice game, with neat graphics, good audio, relaxing music, fun gameplay, pretty stable engines and pretty nice mechanics.Positive PointsNeat graphics and texturesVaried atmospheresPretty nice audio and musicFun and challenging gameplayMultiplayer availableSimple user-interfaceSimple controlsPretty stable enginesPretty nice mechanicsSteam achievements Trading cardsNeutral PointsSome more additional designs (like symbols) would be nice for the ballsIt’d be great if the game had diversified music when reaching a new levelNegative PointsThe servers are not alive, but this is because the game is very newThis game is hard for people who can’t keep synchronized with the ballRight now it has little contentThe game has a bugged user-interface for 4:3 monitors, do not purchase it if you own a 4:3 monitor ",649,156,18,43,60,10,68

												One of the most atractive, adictive, cheapest and with a good graphic engine that i have ever seen. This game is goint to make you spend a lot of time playing it, beacause have amazing graphichs and implements new difficult challenges but at the same time it is easier with some practise. This game use the UnrealEngine 4 that makes it look good. The game haves a lot of levels with new challenges. Another thing its that use an strange types of physics, that make this game spectacular. This game is better than another platform  game in the store. Also it have a Multiplayer Mode, this makes it even better because always play with friends is better. You can  do competitions to see who beats faster level. Another important implement is the custom ball, this means that you can choose differents colors for make your own ball. For finish this is one of the best platform games that are on the market.			",42,3,0,1,8,0,3

												A highly entertaining and bright 3D platform game, that seems to feature some wonky controls (and seems to take some pride in it) to crank up the difficulty of the game; but it's actually not all that bad. Unlike countless other games the likes of Egg Returns Home that shamelessly rely on it's cheap wonky controls entirely for their difficulty, Totally Unbalanced's 'wonky' controls are actually bearable and manageable. You slip every once in a while, but your skill would, at the very least, actually matters; you can learn it and get used to it fairly quickly.The game also boasts fantastic background music. The majority of the music I heard were pure bliss and they resonate very well with me, with the easy standout being the music they used for the very first level. I have no complaints aside from the fact that they didn't use that for more levels, considering I only heard it used in one other instance.Overall, Totally Unbalanced is a great game, especially considering it's price tag - which considering how it features easy achievement and trading cards as a cherry on top, becomes even more impressive.

												This is a game that basicly showcase the unreal engine's physics engine. You guide a ball from point A to Point B though rolling and jumping. IT's a lot easier said then done. Single player there are 2 modes. summer with water and winter with ice. Each map you always have to solve some small puzzle to proceed. Graphic is acceptable but really not to my taste but the music is great. I think i enjoyed the music comes with the game a lot more then the actual game itself as I found out I am actually quite bad at balancing and percision when it comes to control a ball. (which is probably the reason I know i will get killed by all my friend IF I ever play rocket league). The achievments are really easy to get and can be 100% within just a couple minutes or if you proceed on the single player map you will unlock it quite soon since the ball will drop into water plenty of times. IF the achivements didn't register after a bit. You probably lost connection to the multiplayer server a bit. Just exit to main menu and let it reconnect and all the achivements will pop at once.Didn't really try the multiplayer since i know i will suck at it.8/10 for a very relaxing fun small game. Will probably keep this game installed on my computer a while and do 1 map each day until I get bored of it.			",2426,941,80,289,308,25,343

												This game have a lot of features, you can play with friends, you can race against others, and you can just play alone with a lot of levels and challenges.The music in game is sometimes repetitive and the controls are difficult but is the kind of game.The graphics seems to be simple but is a full 3D game, with some minutes playing you will be immersed on a virtual world, the enviroment is well developed and all the graphic work is well cared.I recommend this game if you love indie and casual games !

												First,  full disclosure. I was given a review copy.This game reminds me of a game I used to play when I was a kid called Marble Madness. It is tough as hell. But in a good way.  If you enjoy titles that don't hold your hand. That don't coddle you like a small helpless child. This would be something you are looking for.  I don't think there was anything that I didn't like about this title. The music score of this title was good. The puzzles were fun to figure out. The platforming  was awesome. The multiplayer component was a lot of fun.Tl;DR If you are looking for a title that is hard as hell and a lot of fun then look no further. Platforming, check. Puzzles check. Multiplayer, check. Pull your hair out hard as hell, double duece check. What are you doing by staying here reading this? Buy the damn game and go have some fun already!!! ",2849,1396,73,410,422,19,386

												This is a good creative fun 3d puzzle game with nice colours which can be customized in both side single and multiplayer. This game looks so good made, simple, easy to play and entertaining for all ages. Played afew hours and i did well his first chapters also I've fallen many times so i lol'd a lot but it's addictive and challenging which may require sometime to manuever the ball perfectly in some chapters. I liked the graphics, the relaxing atmosphere with music.Play this game with a controller instead is highly recommended so if you like this kind of games go ahead it's on low price.

												Totally Unbalanced - its a platform game, where you use ball to complete levels with puzzles. Game fully in 3D and use my favorite Unreal Engine 4 (I very like how games made with this engine looks and how physics works, its really important in this game, so huge plus from me for choice UE4). There also multiplayer with 2 modes: races (you need faster than other complete level) and sumo (you need push opponents outside circle). In future developers will add workshop, modding support, multi-patform and many new content :)			",3917,1515,161,434,572,52,618

Totally Unbalanced est un jeu de plateformes au design soignéJ’ai un grand faible pour les jeux où on dirige une balle.Votre balle, dans ce jeu, va devoir se déplacer sur des plateformes avec pour objectif d’atteindre le point d’arrivée mais aussi résoudre pour chaque niveau de petites énigmes (toujours bien inclues dans le jeu en lui même).Evidemment, il est préférable de savoir bien manier la manette pour jouer à Totally Unbalanced. Le jeu ne s’adresse pas aux débutants ou alors à ceux qui aiment les défis et les jeux difficiles.Enfin, un argument qui milite en faveur de ce jeu, c’est son prix. A moins de 4 euros, c’est un achat que l’on ne peut pas regretter quand on compte aux heures de plaisir que l’on va avoir en jouant.Pour lire l'ensemble de mes impressions sur Totally Unbalanced.[www.graal.fr] ",1590,667,28,161,185,17,237

												Totally Unbalanced reminds me of the game Super Mario Maker. The puzzles are incredibly frustrating to clear and you may have to go through many tries in order to get it right. And after clearing the puzzle, you have to steer the ball, jumping across the platforms to reach to the goal. This is probably one of the hardest platformers I have ever played.The game also provides for a large range of customizable settings to suit the player needs from screen resolution to even the framerate limit. The game uses simple to understand colour schemes which are quite comfortable to the eyes.This game has infinite potential if it allows player created maps.9/10			",1148,428,38,161,151,21,190

												Of course this game is good, even very very good. I love platformer games where you control a ball and this is this kind of game, so, I can only recommend it.One last thing, it is a platformer and if you are not that good at it, you will die a lot... but, it is not important as long as you can progress even if it is slowly.

												Game uses Unreal Engine 4 Reminds me of a  certain Win 95 3D game  but with much better graphics and a modern twist .You have to guide your ball and complete puzzles and get past obstacles in a timely manner to reap the best rewards The game also has Steam Workshop for user created addons which could lead to some great user made content.According to the dev the game has been optimised to work better on older computers  though if your computer is very very old you should investigate first before purchasing .I haven't tried the Online Multiplayer + arena mode yet but it's there if you're interestedWatch out for more updates and user created mods if you purchase it.. Fun game ,i like it.P.S:It has achievements and Trading Cards which is always good.			",1789,729,51,210,200,20,238
