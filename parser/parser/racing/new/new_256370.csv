												Great game.  It offers a great sense of realism and really challenges your abilities while still being great for any beginner.  Not that I need to mention it, but the graphics are quite amazing as well.  Sounds are okay.  They aren't the best in the world, but they will do.  The career mode is fairly in depth and you can tweak just about every setting on your bike which is very nice.The only issue I am experiencing right now is the sound cutting off about 30 minutes in causing me to restart the game (onboard Realtek 7.1).  I experienced the same bug in the demo.  I still definitely recommend the game for any enthusiastic racer.UPDATE1:  There is one thing that absolutely BUGS me about this game and it totally kills the realism for me.  Devs, if you are reading this, please for the love of God FIX THE START GATE!  This whole ""ready, steady, start"" crap is so annoying.  You guys just need to make it where you get the 30 second warning board turned sideways and just drop the gate randomly (2-10 seconds) and if you go too soon you get stuck at the gate.  This is not a game killer for me, but for a game that is striving for realism, I can't believe you guys could mess this up.Also, a possible workaround for the sound bug for me seems to be changing the ""voices number"" to 32 instead of 64.  So far it is working, I'll update this review if I discover that it didn't fix it.UPDATE2:  Changing the ""voices number"" did not fix the problem.			",232,26,4,15,4,2,11

												Coming from a pretty seasoned MX Sim & MX VS ATV player & experienced MX rider I thought I'd give my 2 cents. PRO's:                                               Real sponsors & bikes.                      Real tracks.                                       Real riders.                                       Track deformation.                        Cornering feels great. Sliding it into a tight turn and powering out feels better than any other mx game out there.                    Throttle control. Again, using throttle control to kick the back end out is wonderful.                                            First person actually looks & feels good. Actually needing to brake.The game looks nice...just about. Bike models look amazing, well done.Pretty in depth career mode, & 1st one for a long time.Customisation of the bike settings before a race is great.Practice/Qualifying formats.And finally well done Milestone for a simultaneous PC release! CON's Physics in the air feel awful & clunky. Ready Steady Go start format? Is this Mario Kart? Should just drop the gate & the clutch...(see next point).Theres no clutch!!??? Massive negative here.....Why can't I control the whip/scrub? Don't animate such an important feature!! Doesn't feel fluid or natural.Track deformation doesn't make a difference to handling. Ruts and berms don't feel supportive & I feel like cross rutting isn't an issue, even late in a race.Spin outs and wheelies can feel random at times.No rev sound on the start gate & in the air?? Get that stuff recorded and implement it!! Basic stuff there...Rear brake & panic rev doesn't do much in the air.Why make 250F's unable to clear most jumps? They're pretty much as fast as a 450F irl, sometimes out qualifying them.Summary. To be fair, on the ground at least MXGP feels great. Cornering is good, feedback feels great, the rider positioning and animations are spot on and you can make this engine look good once you have got it down. But the clunky whip/scrub feature and the lack of rev sounds brings you literally crashing back down to earth with a bang. The career mode is deep and rewarding, although I get the impression a few things could have been pushed a little more. I guess not being able to choose which clothing brand I wear is due to clothing being tied to some teams & manufacturers with it being official sponsors and all. But it just feels like some design choices could have been implemented a little better. I love mx games, and will buy them regardless to support the industry. We need developers to keep making these games so it pushes them further. If Milestone release an MXGP 2, or MXGP 2015 or whatever its called, I think it will be great, but this one just falls short of a great title. 5.5/10 imho.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Coming from an ex amateur Motocross racer and a huge fan of all moto games alike, I have to say this is the game I have been waiting for. It can be a mild arcade racer for those of you that just want a fun moto game, while the vets and fans of real riding will love the Sim aspect of the game once you put the difficulty and assists to realistic. The game is pretty much MX Sim with better graphics than alive and the dual stick controls we love from reflex. The career is very realistic and has timed practice as well as qualifying with every race on the career, then like real Motocross you will do a moto 1 and moto 2 to see who gets the points for the weekend. The AI will keep you on the edge until the checkered flag, you never know when someone is going to scrub past you or show a wheel in a turn. Real racers, real tracks, real sponsors, real everything. Best moto game in years and a must buy to any fan of the sport.  9/10			",362,61,20,41,40,6,48

												Wow...I'm impressed.  I raced motocross and did my fair share of freestyle and enduro for close to 12 years so I know a thing or 2 about motocross.  That being said it's been a good decade since my glory days with my 2003 CR250R and video games is about as close as I can get to my favorite past time without winning the lottery so finding this game was a real treat, and very nice alternative to the super fun, but dated mx reflex.   Anyway, the game handles and looks great IMO, im not a fan of the GP circuit but since this is the most authentic motocross game I'll take what I can get, and while I don't think a freestyle(tricks) mode is needed in a sim racer like this, i do wish it had a free ride mode(big jumps and whips).  Like say a big open playground in Glamis Sand Dunes.  That would have been the icing on the cake.  They decided to go the racing only route and thats cool and all because they really focused on that one thing and really spit shined it.  After playing this game im really hoping for a next gen sequel with a bit more content like free ride, enduro, and freestyle because I have really come to like the more weighted feel of the bike handling.  Maybe im looking through rose shaded glasses but it really does feel quite authentic when it comes to the handling.  I highly recommend this to any actual motocross racers/riders and/or fans in the room.  Thumbs up!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												MXGP - The Official Motocross Videogame is a motocross racing simulation game developed by Milestone S.r.l. In MXGP you start your career as a wildcard and work your way through MX2 and MX1 championships until you can rise to the top of the leaderboard. As you get better and perform well through the season you'll get offers from better teams and you'll have a much wider selection than the handful of teams you can pick as a wildcard. As well as the career mode there's also Instant Race, Grand Prix, Championship, Time Trial and Multiplayer game modes.+Great graphics+Realistic physics+Interesting control scheme (Gamepad) where one stick is used to steer the bike while the other is used to control how your rider is leaning+You compete against 15 other riders across 14 real tracks+The 60 riders and 60 bikes featured in the game are all real+Winning/competing earns you EXP which levels you up, levelling up unlocks new rider portraits and helmets+In career mode you can skip stages you don't want to play, for example you can go straight to qualifying if you don't want to do any practice laps+Quite a few different teams, each with their own bike livery and outfit+Your team sets you goals which you have to complete in order to stay with said team which adds extra challenge to the game+/-The multiplayer is pretty dead, personally I don't care since I only play Singleplayer in racing games but I know this is a big deal for a lot of people-The game does not take kindly to Alt+Tab, it will always freeze the game if not your whole PC-Not a major issue but the mouse can't be used to navigate the menus-The tutorials only feature Gamepad bindings so they're useless if you wish to play with KB&M-The KB&M controls are absolutely awful but that's to be expected from a racing game-The bike sounds aren't great, i.e. they don't sound realisticVerdict:Worth Purchasing (7.5/10)MXGP is a good motocross racing sim with great graphics, realistic physics, an interesting control scheme and licensed bikes, riders and tracks. If you're a fan of motocross or you're interested in getting into it you can't go wrong with this game.Review copy providedNo drama, Just Reviews?El K.			",670,170,24,76,100,6,76

												Preface: I come from a deep motocross backgroundAfter playing this game for a few days, I can, without a doubt, say that this game is the most realistic motocross game out right now.  Unfortunately the bar isn't set very high, considering the only competition to this game is previous titles from the same developer.  Despite how realistic everyone says the rider physics are, how authentic everyone says the track and bike physics are, and despite the fact that they (the devs) call this game a ""simulator"" in the opening credits, the idea that this game represents a realistic take on motocross is laughable at it's very best.  Every single AI rider will attempt to scrub seemingly every small bump they ride up to, no matter how much time they lose wobbling off a small jump that didn't require them to scrub any speed at all.  If you hit a rider, expect him to stay upright while you go flying.  If another rider hits you, expect him to stay upright while you go flying.  If you hit the yellow dirt, rather than the brown dirt, expect to get thrown off your bike.  How depends on the angle you approach the white dirt at speed.  But as soon as you hit it, you either start floating while flailing your arms while your bike sinks into the ground, or you literally fall right through the bike and start ragdolling all over the place.  It's just infuriatingly stupid. The very last race I ran, a rider came down on top of my bike and literally rode a third of a lap on top of my helmet.  When he finally dismounted... I crashed.  He didn't.  I mean, FFS?  Also, ""career mode"" is nothing more than a continuous championship mode with the choice of bike livery between seasons.  There's no depth or fun.  You don't feel like you're building or contributing to anything.  You just simply race, go back to the silly appartment, rinse and repeat.  Oh, but you can pick your helmet (I'm rolling my eyes).Want to know what pisses me off even more?  The fact that they force you to use mouse and keyboard in menus unless you want to guess which buttons do what.  For a game that is a true to life ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console port, you'd think they'd at least have some decent controller setup and support.  And multiplayer... ♥♥♥♥ing multiplayer.  I can't comment on it because it just plain doesn't work.  I've created an account, I've activated it via email, and even visted their website using it.  But any time I click on multiplayer, it tells me I need an activated account to play.  The one redeaming quality this game has is that it's track deformation isn't matched in any game, any genre, anywhere.  (And... I take this back.  SpinTires puts it to absolute shame.  VBS2.5 also does better, though I couldn't call it a game.)  There are more fun racing games.  There are more fun motocross games, for that matter.  There are certainly more realistic racing games, even with bikes, despite the unfortunate fact that there are no MX game competitors. Do I reccomend this game?  Only if you REALLY REALLY REALLY need to ride a dirt bike in a game.  Otherwise, spend your money on something less half-baked. PS: the graphics don't look nearly as good as the screenies.  The graphics suck.  Expect terrain LOD popping at all times as well.			",106,7,14,19,30,3,28

												Although this game has a few flaws it's still the best motorcross game I've ever played. MXGP is not a game where you pull off insane tricks or jump off giant cliffs. MXGP is a recreation of real MX racing and it does this fairly well.Pros:+ There are multiple game types - Instant race, Grand Prix, Championship season, Career Mode and Time attack. It has  recreated tracks from real tracks on the MX tour. The tracks also have track deformation of the dirt and mud. There seams to be a lot of tracks as well. I'm not real far into it but the season I'm in has at least a dozen to complete.+ Multiple difficulties that can be tweaked to make MXGP as easy/arcade or Hard/Simulation as you prefer.+ The physics and handling of the motorcycles are done very well. No other MX game has gotten this close to the feeling of riding a real MX bike. (yes I have ridden on real MX bikes and street bikes as well)+The replays look good and have multiple options like slow motion, pause and a free cam. You can get some nice screenshots.+ Graphics are solid. The riders and the bikes look good and gather dirt and mud on them during the race. The tracks are pretty good too but could have been done better. I use SweetFX on this game and it makes it look better.+You can remap the controls on the controller. I recommend you use a controller. I don't know of any racing game that work well with mouse and keyboard. At least not for me. I recommend that you change the lean forward and backwards to the same stick as steering left and right. It feels much more natural this way.+You level up, unlock pictures, gear, bikes ect and you get more fans the better you do in each race. Also there is a simulated email and twitter type media in the game that makes tyou feel you are being watched by teams, fans and your manager. It's a nice touch to give a sense of progression and connection in the game.Cons:- The presentation is pretty bad. In between races I've had my bike disappear in the pits. The pit crew guy is working on an imaginary, invisible bike. Also before a race, during the intro scene, my rider was shaking around like he was have convultions. The pit crew and girl who holds the starting card all look and act like zombies. Why even put these in the game ?  Also, Some of the ground during races has pop in and loads textures too. The game needs a patch to fix these things.- The sound is not very good either. The bikes just sound weak, why can't developers get this right ? Even if it's not realistic they need to alter the engine sounds to make them more rich and intense. Also, There is no option to play music during races, it would be nice to have. I noticed there is barely any sounds of the stadium surroundings happening. It would be great to have the crowd react to what is happening. Cheer when you overtake or respond to a big wreck. Make the game and the race feel exciting Milestone ! Enough with the barebones, boring presentation already ! Also a track announcer being heard over the PA system would add some immersion. Having your pit crew tell you your doing great or you have 1 lap to go would really add some interaction to the game. These things could have be easily added into the game and would make the game better. On my PC the sound cuts in and out during start videos but no real problem in game so far. I've seen that many people have had problems in game though. Patch these things into the game Milestone.Overall the game just feels kind of bland. This happed in other games by Milestone. I loved the racing and handling in MotoGP 08 but it has the same barebones presentaion and sound as well. Milestone get the racing right, and that is what is most important, but they need to add some flavor and style into these games. As for now I will enjoy MXGP for what it is but there is definately room for improvement.			",324,126,18,59,26,3,85

			Episode 53: 30FP-ISIS Review edited and written by 16-Bit Today's episode we take a look at MXGP The ""Official"" Motocross Videogame from Milestone games!		

History & Overview-Released in 2014-Developed and published by Milestone and distributed by Bandai Namco Games-Released on PC, PS3, PS4, PS VITA, and Xbox360-Standard Racing AffairIn MXGP it's your typical standard racing affair but just with a lot more mud and dirt thrown in.The game has a number of different standard modes to choose from, including an instant race mode which basically randomly selects a track and rider for you, and you simply race.As well as a “Grand Prix” mode which let's you pick a rider or your own created one, a track, and race.A “championship” mode which let's you pick a rider or your own, select tracks and make your customized season to race for and championship to win.A time attack mode, which is pretty self explanatory that let's you race for the best time on any given track.As well as online multiplayer, but as of this recording it's pretty much dead sadly, so this review will be based purely on the single player content of the game.But the core aspect to the single player of the game itself  is the “Career mode” which let's you use a customized character of your very own, select a team to race for and represent, and build your very own fan-base.Each time you compete in a race your rewarded with experience that unlocks you new gear as well as “fans” that comment on how you did on a race via a weird mock twitter thing...But is any of this any good?The Good-Standard racing game with solid mechanics-Real world mechanics, brands, and riders-Decent controls with a bit of a learning curveGrowing up personally I was pretty fond of games such as the “MX vs ATV” series, so when I was offered the chance to review MXGP I jumped on the idea naturally because of this.MXGP is brought to us by the same cats behind the “MotoGP” franchise and where as games such as MX vs ATV go for more of an arcade approach to off-road racing, MXGP aims for a much more grounded and pure racing focused approach with solid mechanics backing it.Controlling your bike definitely has a learning curve to it, you'll need to know how to approach each jump, and you use both analog sticks to shift your weight with the bike as you ride and it feels really responsive once you wrap your head around the controls themselves, the first few times I raced I fell plenty of times not knowing I actually had to shift my weight and use both analog sticks.I personally played on the default settings of the game with the default assisted control settings as I'm pretty rusty when it comes to off-road style racing games, but the game does offer the option to completely disable all the control assists and adjust them as you wish for all the purists out there.What MXGP does best is that it offers a more real world approach to Motocross racing and with real world mechanics, everything from the physics of the bike itself and shifting your weight with it, to how you land from jumps, turn corners, to the tracks being being based off real world locations with plenty of different tracks to choose from, to the teams utilizing real world brands, and racing against real world drivers.But sadly it doesn't do much in the way of standing out or being interesting for very long... So let's discuss why with...The Bad-No tricks?-No real in-depth customization-Not much variety and tons of game paddingOne of the reasons why I loved games such as the MX vs ATV series was doing all the fantastic tricks that you could pull off, sadly MXGP features none of that.The most trick related thing you'll even be doing in MXGP is whipping or scrubbing your bike to aim for a better landing in between slopes,  as I said previously MXGP aims for a more grounded and racing focused experience, which I guess is what the actual MXGP competition is, but none the less I was kinda disappointed by this.Next up the game doesn't offer much in customization, when you're creating your character you basically pick a pre-created display picture for him who's probably just random developer, select a nationality, make a name, and pick a number... That's really about it, but then again character customization in a racing game isn't a huge deal obviously, but this also extends to your bike as well, outside of adjusting the control assists or your bikes technical aspects, you have no real aesthetic customization to your bike itself which is also pretty disappointing.But probably my biggest issue is the massive amounts of padding in the career mode itself, you basically go to your calender, select your next race, set up your settings, you can do a practice run to wrap your head around the track, then you can do qualifying race, all of this you can skip of course.Then you finally race.... Then you race again... Maybe this is how it works in the actual MXGP but by the time you've done all this you've basically raced this same track a good 4 times and spent a good 15 to 20 minutes with it.Then you come back to your garage-thing, read your email for potential teams or sponsors, and read your twitter thing.Then you select your next race event and do it all over again.By the end of it all after racing every event, the game then just simply tells you to do it all over again but with a different class of bikes and slightly improved AI, the exact same tracks, in the exact same order.To which I just simply responded “No” after having already sunk 8 hours or so into this game.But now let's discuss,The Ugly-Looks bland, nothing really impressive-Muddy tracks being torn up as you race is kinda cool-Locked at 30fps-Clipping issues, bugs, and crashes-No licensed music or soundtrack while racing-Over all presentation is somewhat blandWhere we discuss the graphics, technical aspects, soundtrack, and general presentation of the game.Over all MXGP is fairly bland looking considering this is a 2014 release and doesn't offer much in the way  of visuals nor will it be any bit taxing on your system by any means, the tracks themselves are based on real world locations and look decent enough and the track itself having the dirt torn up by bikes as you race is pretty neat to see.However what's not so neat to see was my frame rate counter being locked at 30, I don't see any valid reason for a racing game of all things to be locked at 30fps, especially on PC.The game also suffers from some clipping issues as you fall from your bike the odd time, as well as some other bugs and the odd rare crash I had happen once or twice during my 8 or so hours with it.As for the soundtrack side of things, the game is completely devoid of any licensed music or soundtrack outside of the main menu music which is generic guitar stuff, so as your racing you'll basically just hear the wonderful sounds of dirt-bike engines.And all over the presentation for MXGP is just extremely bland, everything from the lifeless career mode and fake twitter social media thing, to the lack of music as you race, the only thing that even stood out to me was the massive amounts of in-game Monster Energy advertisements. Final ThoughtsOver all MXGP certainly feels like a budget title and doesn't do much to convince you otherwise. It's a competent racing game with nice mechanics going for it but it doesn't do much in the way to stand out from the rest and I still ONLY recommend if it if you're big into MX racing or off-road racing games in general.

												Another great motorsports title from Milestone. You can expect the same game modes and user interface as previous titles. But if it aint broke, dont fix it, right? The feel of racing the dirt bikes is excellent and will surely please any racing game fan out there. A quick tutorial gets you flinging dirt in no time. FYI - I'm not really into motocross or supercross, but this game is a lot of fun regardless of any of that. PS - Kimi Raikkonens MX1 team is in here ""ICE ONE""			",147,11,33,12,31,0,21

												While more of a simcade than anything, MXGP is a must own for any MX fans out there. While far from perfect, MXGP tries to aim for a slightly more realistic approach to MX racing via realistic cornering and braking physics, but falls short with poor jumping physics and poor bike sounds. A CONTROLLER IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!Pros:+ 14 Real world tracks to choose from+ Realistic cornering and braking+ Authentic racing experience (Real tracks, bikes, teams and riders)+ Good graphics+ Bike tuning (though somewhat limited in terms of options) actually affects the way bikes behave+ Decent AI (15 AI riders supported in offline play)+ Intense multiplayer races see players banging bars as they fight for the perfect lines (12 players supported)+ Mo-capped rider animations look awesome+ Realistic helmet cam view (if that's your kind of thing)Cons:- Horrible bike sounds (what is this, Excitebike?)- Poor jumping physics (lack of mid-air control/no gas gyro effects)- Scrubbing seems rather mechanical and automated (players are only required to push both sticks in the same direction near the lip/takeoff of a jump which requires no real skill and uses the same animation over and over)- Track deformation is mostly cosmetic (players cannot physically ride in ruts formed on the track) [*edit* after 5+ laps, corners are harder to take due to braking ruts/bumps forming, however bikes ride 'on top' of the dirt as opposed to 'in it' thus resulting in mounds forming in corners as opposed to ruts which players can ride in for better traction.]- Relatively steep price (although not gameplay related)Still highly recommend picking this game up as it breathes fresh air into the MX racing genre, providing countless hours of fun on tracks which are easy to learn but hard to master (and pays off if you do). The game has good AI for those who wish to play offline, but online play is where this game truly shines. Despite the games efforts of providing an authentic MXGP experience, a track editor would have been a nice touch.TL;DRGreat MX game which is a step in the right direction, with room for improvement. If/when improved, could easily be one of the best MX racing games out there.  8/10			",190,17,18,13,34,3,22

												Before I totally thrash this game, let me say that it is THE BEST motocross game ever released. The developers are definitely on the right track with this game. This is the most realistic motocross game ever. However..1. This is a very, very barebones game. Once you have mastered it and can win on highest difficult on all of the tracks it is boring. All you will be doing is the same races over and over again. Online can add some better competition, but it hardly ever works. When it does work it is totally laggy, and I don't even mean the other players are lagging around. It is YOUR bike that is jerking around. What the hell is up with that?!?!? Just no. That's horrible.  - Make an actually fun career mode to fix this. Take hints from other racing games... I really like how in career on F1 2012 you can complete challenges to ""collect data for research"" and if you can complete the challenges correctly you can gain a performance improvement that stays for the rest of the career. That is really cool and keeps you playing the career mode, because it is not the same thing over and over again. Add that to this game!!   - Make online multiplayer actually work, thanks.2. WHERE ARE THE TWO STROKES? This ain't motocross without two strokes. It even says the displacement limits for the two strokes before you select which class to race. So where are they?  - Add two-strokes, people love them3. The sound is HORRIBLE in this game. Seriously what am I riding, a bicycle with a spoke slapper or a high tech racing engineered single? Because in this game it really sounds like a bicycle with a spoke slapper. The sound of the bikes is SO stupid. Jeez it's ridiculous   - I don't know how the developers managed to screw this up, but unscrew it!4. The rear end is firmly planted. There is way too much rear end traction. We are riding on the dirt here. In real life the rear end is soooo light and easy to break loose. You can't steer with the rear much in this game because that rear tire won't break loose! Even jabbing fully on the rear brake doesn't cause the tire to lock!   - Decrease the traction in the rear!5. The 250's don't have enough power. Seriously, you're telling me I can't power out of a corner in second gear on a 250? That's just wrong. Also the 250's rev WAY too slowly. In real life when you blip the throttle it will go from idle to rev limit before your brain can even process what just happened. On this game it takes a whole 1.5 seconds to rev to the limiter in neutral or in the air. That's wrong.   - Engines need to rev up more quickly6. Downshifting and engine braking slow the bike down like magic. Again the rear end is demonstrating way too much traction. If you come hauling ♥♥♥ at 50mph into a turn on this game, all you need to do is slam it down to first gear and you immediately slow down to the max speed of first gear. That is so stupid.   - Decrease the rear end traction!!!7. The power on all of the bikes is far too easy to control. You can slam it wide open on a 450 coming out of a corner in second gear on this game and everything will be just fine. Really? Because I'm pretty sure that will totally break your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ open in real life as all the ♥♥♥♥ comes blasting out of it.   - Power needs to be more violent8. The whips/scrubs are programmed. You don't get to do them yourself, they just happen if you lean off of a jump. That was really disappointing. The worst part is the impending front flip after you do a whip. You can't throttle out of it after you whip, your ♥♥♥ is just going over the bars!   - At the very least, fix the front flip problem. You should be able to hit the throttle to get the front end up mid air9. The power on the 450s peaks too early. You make it half way through the rev range and then the power drops off and stops picking up. That's wrong. Yes, 450s have assloads of power at low RPM but they still do peak way up there.10. No clutch option to slip the clutch. Being able to slip the clutch is important, especially on 250s when you need to get to the meat of the power at the apex of a turn. You can't do that in this game, which is a big problem.11. The ruts don't really change the way you ride the track. That's totally unrealistic. Ruts are a game changer.   - Make the ruts able to dig down deeper into the track.12. Helmet camera is horrible on this.    - increase the field of view both vertically and horizontally13. I'd like more setup options. Gear ratio options: you get to choose between low, medium or high. Woooooooooooooooo that's just epic isn't it? NOT -.- 14. Let's have some weather! Motocross doesn't magically make the weather 75F and sunny. Change it up a bit!15. There just isn't much of an exciting atmosphere to the game. It's pretty drab :/16. Add some more excitement with camera effects and other special effects. A tiny bit of motion blur and camera shake would be nice. Update the graphics so they don't look so old and plain! Again take hints from other racing games. The Shift 2 / Project CARS game engine is a perfect example of how camera and graphics effects can really make the game!			",34,0,7,0,5,1,3

Teal DeerDevelopers: Milestone S.r.l.Publishers: Plug In Digital, Milestone S.r.l.Initial release: March 2014Genre: Racing, Offroad, Simulation #Worth/NotWorth: #Worth BSERC - (Borderline Sardonic and Extremely Reductive Comparison): ExciteBike 64's older more mature brother Exposition, Concurrence and SummationMXGP is a dirtbike simulation removed from the slightly more arcade MX franchise from THQ. It draws from the actual sport as far as the career. Reminiscent of DiRT 2, you have a sort of office space to navigate as the menu. Looking at standings or emails for team offers; it's even got it's own fake social media to get trash talked by rivals and praise from fans. There is always a quite a learning curve I feel in MotoBike games to overcome due to the added mechanic of needing to control the lean and balance of the rider atop the bike for peak efficiency. The game has some varied options of assists to aid in learning this; From making it mostly autonomous to complete manual control of the riders lean. There is also a nice balance of gear head tinkering. Balanced in the way that even someone with a limited grasp of the way an engine works can still fine tune the bike to their desired performance. It isn't as robust as say shopping for parts and getting into the nitty gritty but it has some simplified values that for example, can change the bike height on each wheel base as well as spring stiffness, coil dampening to affect responsiveness/stability and the gear ratio to effectively change the preference to favor acceleration or top speed. Each setting is affixed with a short and concise blurb as to what increasing or decreasing each setting would affect. Some technical snafu's There are some minor graphical issues regarding the menus showing up from time to time but are not really that troublesome as they can be navigated still and with relative ease.  The game's V-sync is locked at 30fps regardless of the setting you choose and your refresh rate. It must be overridden through the Nvidia control panel or AMD catalyst. THE GISTVery competent MX game. Strikes a nice balance between the totally insane arcade MX games whilst making an easy entry point for the more simulation minded folk . However, if you're really into some proper sim gear head tinkering you'll likely not be very satisfied with that aspect. Follow my curation for more ",1041,294,48,105,93,7,96

												The best Motocross game I have played.And actually the first that have been driveble in first person view, and feels really good to drive that way!Pros:The physics.Being able to drive in first person view.Nice real world tracks with track deformation, some really spectacular and fun ones!Nice enough graphics and runs smooth.The racing feels real, the AI's behaves good, makes mistakes and spread out over the races.Cons:Don't like that the game auto release the throttle when airborne, and could have been a bit easier to over tilt the bike forward and backwards in the air.The sound could have been a bit better and diverse.Could have been a couple of harder AI modes, when I got the hang of it the AI gets a bit easy to beat on some tracks, even on realistic with hardcore mode without assists.

												This is by far the most realistic and enjoyable MX game I've ever played. It can really make you feel like you're riding... except I can ride a lot faster in the game and I don't get arm pump :-)   It's great for older guys like me!Personally, using the first person camera and a Logitech Extreme 3D Pro joystick is a nice setup. I use the trigger for gas, 'joystick twist' for lean left/right, x-axis for steering, y-axis for lean forward/backward and two of the buttons on the base for my front and rear brakes. I paid full-price with zero regrets. I'll also be getting this game for my Vita. I would love to see some DLC Supercross tracks in the future.Yep, I highly recommend this game.			",20,4,6,10,12,0,11

												I got this game a week after launch. I hate it. It crashes after every online race. Every time I want to play online I need to creat a new account because the old account is not recognized as being valid. I am guessing that they make it do this so the leaderbords say there are a bunch of users when there are really a fraction of that number.If there were not the problems listed above the game would be ok but the MX Vs ATV games are still better and there is a new one of those comming out next month so save your money for that.If they ever fix online for this game and the price was like 10-15 bucks I would say get it.

												I'm very unsure whether I would recommend this game or not. So I will say no because I dont have a single friend who is into motocross who likes this game enough to buy it. Now that instantly makes it sound like this game isnt worth your time, but it really depends on who you are. I personally ride in real life, as well as film and help out in the pits for friends when they are racing. This sport is a large part of my life and has been since I was very young.I also grew up playing the mx vs atv series, a series which was recently resurrected. The best motocross game I have ever played is still ""MX vs ATV: Reflex"". Unfortunately the MX vs ATV series has reduced in quality and became far too ""arcady"" since then.Now, on to this game. I will start with the pros and cons.PROS:-HUGE improvement over MUD (the previous MX game released by these devs)-Official licensed riders, gear, brands, sponsors and tracks-Decent gameplay (more on this later)-Decent amount of content-Decent Graphics-Career mode is pretty coolCons-Milestone will barely support their games after release. This game doesn't have glaring technical issues but if it did they would be unlikely to patch it.-The gameplay is BARELY Decent-Is by no means a Simulator-Whip/Scrub physics. We told the devs exactly what needed to be done with the whips and scrubs (make them similar to mx vs atv reflex with slightly more realism) but instead it is just the same locked animation over and over and over.-They may not be changing much for the sequel (from what I have seen so far)-Audio is S***.   Seriously I had to mute the engine noise it is that bad, sounds nothing like a dirt bike. the saddest part is it is recorded from an actual bike. So i have no idea if it is their equipment, compression or editing that absolutely destroys it.-Bikes. the power curve is no where near realistic. I should feel like im riding a bull not a slugThe game is alright, a bit of fun when played in moderation. People need to know that this is not a simulator, even though it is commonly reffered to as one. It is only slightly above being very arcady. A big issue with the tracks and physics are jumps and berms. the jumping physics are very floaty and the jump sizes do not appear to be realistically sized compared to their real world counterparts. Then there are berms. in the real world berms are great for catching your speed and helping you maintain it around a corner. If you hit a berm too fast in real life you will likely ""blow it out"" meaning the front end pushes through the dirt ruining the line and likely making you crash. in this game you cant hit 90% of berms (the tops of berms specifically) without them blowing out, at any speed, which completley ruins the point of even putting them on the track. In other words, some parts of the track dont have collisions.Then there are controls. It is great that they copied mx vs atv and added dual stick controls. one stick for the rider weight and one for the bike steering. This is one of the biggest improvements over ""MUD"". In-air controls are horrible. Hit a jump leaning back and go front end high? Too bad even leaning all the way foward and hitting the back brake as hard as you possibly can (as you would do in a worst case senario in real life) wont save you. There is no engine gyro effect, throttle and brake have little or no effect in the air which is very dissapointing. Cornering is Good but not great, track degradation doesnt effect you very much.Dont even think about playing this game without a controller, that makes it multiple times worse.I could elaborate more on the cons of this game but I wont. If a casual arcade game without a lot of challenge (after you get used to the basic controls) is what you are after go ahead.Die hard motocross fans who want a simulator are still stuck with the dated, but still the closest thing to a full on simulator we have, ""MX simulator"" it isnt on steam and certainly isnt for everyone but if you have the same complaints as me it may be what you are after. I look foward to seeing if they respond to fans and make improvements in the sequel, due out early 2016.(I personally have my doubts as the devs seem to think the main playerbase is children, reffering to us as ""crazy crossers"" on facebook... Cringe worthy)Prove me wrong Milestone!			",49,4,6,10,0,0,0

												This is the best motocross game you're going to find.  The graphics are fine if you don't pay any attention to the the generic looking ""race fans"" and other scenery.  The controls(xbox controller) and physics are great,  and it's fun to play right from the start.The listed minimum requirements are pretty low, and I wonder if they would even push 30 FPS.  I'm guessing the minimum should be more like ""Core 2 Duo 3Ghz/GTX260 or equivalent"".  At 1080p the recommended specs probably get about 60-100 FPS, and more current hardware gets 100-200 FPS.

												MXGP, the official motocross videogame. This is a good simulation of the real motocross event and how the bike handles. You can play as the official riders and race on the real world motocross tracks. Also, you get bikes like KTM, Suzuki, Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki and Tm (I don't remember the last manufacturer). In Career mode, you start as a wildcard rider and if you are good enough, you'll move up to the MX1 class. The riding physics are good, and it is somewhat newbie-friendly. It will take a while to get used to the handling of the bike, and the AI (on easy they can be a challenge if you are new to the game).One drawback is you can't turn off the controller vibration. This is pretty annoying, especially for someone who doesn't like to play with vibration (like me). The multiplayer? There's almost no one playing there, but it doesn't bother me.If you are planning to get this game, I suggest that you get a controller first. You'll have a hard time playing using the keyboard. If you like racing or sports games, I would recommend this game. It's a pretty fun game overall.			",12,0,11,2,2,0,1

												Another MX game that falls short. You'll play it because you spent the money and bought it. But then slowly realize that this game is just not that exciting. Graphics are good, but it's 2014, everything in the game realm looks good. The cornering / braking physics are great, but thats about the end of it. Jumping is terrible, and is truly a giant eye sore every lap, which zaps the fun right out of it. Bike sounds are not even close. No Clutch, starts are just hold the throttle, power/speed/airtime ratio is like the old mars environment on Supercross 2000 for PS. Also, this is completely obvious, but it's called MXGP for a reason. These tracks are total euro style, really rough, and small awkward jumps, which for some reason they thought would be cool, and maybe to some it is. But for me, it's like watching it on TV, and it gets boring.  Keep waiting, and save your money. Play Reflex / Alive to hold you over.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game, just like any has its goods and its bads. Firstly the graphics are the best of a MX game yet. Although the graphics to the track are kind of weird and abnormal but still look fine. The handling is a bit strange at first but once you put in a few races it should be fine. The game limits you on tracks and also customization. The teams and venues are a nice addition to the scene of MX games. Overall I'd give it a 7/10. And if you are on the fence about it and already own Mx vs ATV Reflex go ahead and stick with that.			",15,0,5,0,2,0,1

												Before I say why I recommend the game, I'd like to put forth a few caveats. First of all, even on the highest setting with Pro physics, the AI isn't too hard to beat, and this is coming from someone born the same year Mount Everest was first successfully climbed. The AI appears to have enough straightaway speed but the human player seems to be able to negotiate the corners better. It's not a deal breaker for people like me, but for the very skilled, well, you're going to be bored against the AI, but then that's why there's online racing.To be clear, it's the overall speed of the AI which people might find not as challenging as they wish. In all other respects, the AI riders are outstanding. They take different lines through the corners. They battle one another and occasionally they fall over or crash. They will react to a human player or another AI driver by moving over or sometimes changing lines to block. And they ride differently from one another as they race, they don't all run some hypothetical best racing line. They do seem very much like human racers.If you do want more of a challenge, race in first person view rather than third person or chase view. You will need a video card that can handle it and probably a strong stomach as well, as this can be a bit nausea inducing. It does make the racing more difficult, but at a  cost, so I can't really say that it's a viable solution for everyone.I'd also mention that I've never raced motocross, and it's been four decades since I've been on a motorcycle. So I cannot address the realism of the representation of motocross racing versus the real thing from an actual rider's point of view. However, I think this is true for most people playing a racing game. Also, realistically there's no point in trying to sell again that's so realistic that it would be impossible for most people to play it with any level of accomplishment. My thumbs up recommendation is based upon my perception as I play MXGP. It seems like what I would imagine a motocross bike would feel like to race. I'm using an Xbox360 controller on my PC and controlling the bike is smooth and intuitive. I race with Pro physics and using the two sticks for steering, bike tilt and body lean, I have no issues at all.In my opinion, a successful racing game should present the player with a risk/reward challenge. MXGP does this well. It's possible (again, using Pro Physics) to drive easily and stay upright and on course. However, by judicious pushing at the right time, the player can be rewarded with a lower lap time, although he or she risks a tumble if pushing just a bit too much, or if an AI or human opponent gets involved. This is what a proper racing game should do, give the player a sense of satisfaction for taking risks. Additionally, the tracks in MXGP don't force the player into a ""best"" racing line. It's possible to try different paths in corners, over jumps and even on straights, trying to tie together a better lap. Again, as a player, it's my perception that I'm going faster because I'm exploring difference approaches to each section of the track, and that's enjoyable. The tracks have realistic looking ruts, humps and bumps and during my races I felt that those track features made a real difference to my racing success or failure.The tracks in MXGP present an interesting variety of layouts, elevations and difficulties. I find the variety challenging and again, enjoyable. Graphically they look pretty good as well. The graphics are not 2014 cutting edge, but I think cutting edge is a waste in a racing game outside of the track itself. It's good to have trackside objects to give of speed and provide a sense of  immersion for the player, but objects that are too complex a polygon count would raise the minimum and recommended specs for the game for no real additional purpose. It's better for more folks to enjoy the game at 60 fps. This is not to say that the trackside objects are sparse or of poor visual quality. The opposite is actually true, there are plenty of things to see and they give a great visual appeal to the venue where you are racing. The  lack of a challenge from the AI mentioned at the beginning is really the only serious complaint I have, and of course there's always online racing if you want more of a challenge. I've done several online races and it's pretty straightforward to find a race. I did experience a lot of lag of the other players' avatars, but probably most of them are on the other side of the Atlantic from me, so that's to be expected. The game did run smoothly even with the other racers' lag and with the collision option set to off it really didn't affect my enjoyment. So overall I'm giving this game a positive recommendation. I would strongly suggest that anyone who might be interested in purchasing the game first give the demo a try. The demo is very representative of the experience you'll find in the game.

http://www.cublikefoot.com/mxgp-the-official-motocross-videogame-first-impressions/Believe it or not, I used to actually be a fan of motocross sports. That said, I expected to enjoy this title, but it failed to impress. There's simply too many flaws for it to be enjoyable (mostly technical, however).Don't get me wrong, the game has several good points, and the gameplay itself is rather fun, it just has far too many technical flaws. For one, the game's Vsync is broken. I have a 60Hz monitor, but the game chose to run at 30fps instead. I noticed that others had this problem and ended up disabling this Vsync, which led to framerates of ~200 and some very nice screen tearing. I did solve this by using AMD's control panel, but I shouldn't have had to take that extra step.The game also had several sound issues. A lot of sounds weren't even implemented (really noticeable when your bike goes airborne) and the bikes sounds that were implemented just didn't sound right. I know what these bikes sound like and this just isn't it. Oh, and the game's online service? Broken. Tried three times over three days to play with a friend of mine and it couldn't hold a session for more than a minute. Very disappointing. At least the singleplayer is good?Other than that, the game actually has some nice gameplay. The feedback and all is great and the bikes are easy to control (if you know how to). The game could have been much better had its flaws been fixed prior to release, however.			",1406,554,55,149,193,17,226

Online community is dead.5. You have to sign up and make a account to play online. (No point, can't play online)6. You cannot do tricks. (besides whip, and wheelie)7. Hard boxed dont move when you hit them. (it's annoying)Thanks for reading my review, I am giving the game a thumbs up for hours of fun. If you are looking for a realistic racing mx game, this is for you. If you are looking for a mx game to mess around on, and do free style tricks, this game is not for you.			",55,2,3,4,6,0,0

												This game has so much potential, but the multiplayer is pretty much broken and the developer will not even address comments about it. A game like this lives and dies by mulitplayer because the AI racers are too slow to be competitive once you've played for a few hours.The online issue is the player constantly being booted from the lobby or very early in the game. 2 patches were supposed to address this, but neither one really did anything. It is now rare to find anyone even in the lobby just a few months after the games release.Great tracks, great graphics, great potential, but the fatal flaw of zero developer support after the sale makes me say either give this one a pass or if you think you'll be happy with the single player pick it up when its 5 bucks.

												One of my best purchases on steam. Very fun gameplay, many different riders and tracks to choose from, as well as different setups for each dirt bike. Also, this game provides settings for every skill level possible. You can have it play more like an arcade type of racing game or you can have it be a pretty serious simulation. The only downside I can see to this game is the multiplayer. There aren't too many people playing it anymore, so it may be hard to find a game. (There are private matches you can make if you just want to play with friends though.) I bought this game on sale for about $5, but I also would have paid full price ($20) if I had realized  earlier how fun this game is.Would recommend this game to everyone who wants a fun game. 9/10			",45,0,2,3,3,0,3

												Great Game for all MX fans , looks great feels good and photo mode in replay is awsome ( see my screen shots )Physics are quite good with differing levels for skill set , not as refined as MX v ATV Reflex but very easy to jump on have a go and not fall off even 10ft. Nice Career Mode to biuld up from Wild Card rider in MX 2 for a couple of events and hopfully landing a full time ride on a Top Factory teams bike. So you build up you levels skill get some wins land a top ride win a championship then MX1 waits. The tracks are well made although with some deformation not as good as reflex but if you look past this and other things like the sounds ( this companys biggest flaw across the board of all titles) then its a great game will keep you going for hours.MXGP 2 is coming real soon April i think but i will always keep this gem.Graphics : 9/10Game Play 8.5/10Sounds 5/10.Value for money 9.75/10			",42,7,45,0,22,0,3

												The best MX game out there right now. Somethings that would make this legendary is if they added team options like GRID 1. You should be able to get your own sponsors and be able to get money from them threw race goals. They need to add custom team colors/graphics /names. You should be able to add a team mate to really controll and manige your race team. Also next game add supercross and nationals. this give almost infinet gameplay and something to work for.  (The only negative in this game is that you can get threw all the teams in a few hours and after you win mx2 and mx1 chapionships you arnt really rewarded in anyway and it just becomes repetitive. Over all this game is very good. It has the best bike mechanics out of any mx vs atv games.			",60,5,4,11,10,1,9

The bike sounds are TERRIBLE.If the developer worked a bit more on this game and made it a bit more PC/online oriented, and a bit broader scope than just ""this is ehat happened in 2014 MX1 and MX2"" it would be the best MX racing sim out there.

 9/10	 After playing the demo I was hooked. Preordered it and I'm far from dissapointed, very fun, not for those who dislike a challenge.The game has a few issues such as sound cutting out after about 10-30 minutes but otherwise no glitches. A bit of mouse integration would be nice and for multiplayer it'd be convienient to be able to use Steam to invite and join friends but a seriously good game.It's great and I've never even been MX or anything like that, that said, someone who is looking for a casual arcade-ish game, don't buy this, this is a little more realistic and serious. Lost out on the 10/10 because of the sound cutting out issues, although bearing in mind this is only V1 of the game and it's first day of release, it's pretty sound (no pun intended). Might be easier to play with an xbox, playstation or other gamepad, however it is more than playable with arrows and WASD.At least try it out! :P			",129,8,5,14,14,0,11

												This game is a really fun game, and I easily would recommend it to anyone who enjoys motocross/supercross/offroad racing. Though I do have some negatives too.-There are not many tracks, and after a while it gets pretty boring.-The same people win season mode every season... not very exciting.-The game has reached a point for me where everything is very easy, as I can crash 10 times a race and still win.-The AI are pretty dumb on some of the courses, or there are ways to cut the track.-The PS4 version has 22 racers, while PC has 16 racers in one race? Those are my negatives. Here are my positives.+There is a actually a season mode, and then a customizable championship mode. This is something I love having in racing games.+Graphics are nice. Runs perfectly smooth on my little GT 640.+A much more realistic feel than MX vs ATV, which is something I wanted.+Still, 16 racers is a lot. I just don't understand why PS4 has more tracks and racers. Some PC's could handle it.+I kind of like the ragdoll body when you crash, it's funny.+The controls can be made just like Reflex, which is nice.			",6,0,8,0,1,2,0

												TL;DR: great game === great gameplay === in-game graphics options not good and need to use settings in the GPU control panel === highly recommended.I wasn't really expecting much from this game. I had seen the negative reviews on the ""MotoGP 14"" game (mainly things that said ""stay away from this developer""). However, I chose to ignore this, and I am glad that I did as the game seems pretty good!Don't use the vsync setting within the game as it will perform ""vsync"" to 30fps instead of 60fps. Instead, use the vsync settings on your GPU's control panel (remember to set Triple Buffering too for an even smoother vsync). In fact, you should set all of the graphics options (e.g. anti-aliasing) within the GPU control panel also. All of this is based on information provided directly by Milestone on the following Steam forum post:http://steamcommunity.com/app/256370/discussions/0/558752449290544521/?insideModal=1#c558752449500535076I was able to set everything to the maximum level and I get smooth 60fps on a twin GTX 980M in SLI.The beginner option offers a valid challenge for those new to that type of game. Since I am new to motorcycle games, I chose this option and I was pleased with it.The career mode is reminiscent of Project Cars; the fake social media and the emails from the team. This is a nice touch.I haven't tried the multiplayer options, so unfortunately I cannot comment.Overall, I recommend this game wholeheartedly.Enjoy!			",429,182,43,44,52,5,22

												This game can be fun. It has a few different race options so you can do an instant race or a career mode. The game also has a multiplayer online that I have not tried out. The graphics look sort of dated. They do not look bad. However they do not have the wow factor either. That being said the tracks you race on are varied and a good mix. Some of the tracks have a lot of elevation and some are more flat with little hills scattered around the track. I also think the intro to each track is very well done. Live action video intermixed with game footage. It looks cool.I have the game on easy and on easy as you would expect its super easy to come in first in every race. I find that to be a good thing because the handeling is a bit of mystery to me still. You control the bike with left stick and the rider with the right stick. In theory this should make it more interesting in practice I found it to be a mixed bag. My issue with the handeling of the bike is that the rider will sometimes fall for no reason at all. It can be annoying. A turn you think you can make if you lean to the right can cause you to wipe out. So if you do not lean at all you can easily take the corner perhaps because sometimes he will go nuts and crash for no reason. That is very annoying and really hurts the gameplay. It would help if they would have added a meter to let you know what caused the crash and how to avoid crashing in the turns. Something like what Forza and Grid 2 has.  A meter to let the player know if he is leaning to far left or right. It feels like a lot like luck when you can manage a turn.My other nit pick besides the weird falling down is other riders hitting you and making you crash. Now this looks cool because it can also happen to other computer motorcycles. So that is cool. However the AI racers can be really agressive and can knock you off your bike while they get off scott free. Thats annoying. You can do it to other racers but again its mostly just luck if you pull it out. My other nit pick is the sound. The game cut me off from sound into my next race and this appears to be a common complaint that just never got fixed. I have my audio settings for stero only. Also the game crashed on me one time however after having played a few more races it has yet to repeat this issue. The sound when it works is very good. I feel like I should mention one more thing. The tracks have very little life to them. While the tracks look good and are varied their is not a lot that moves on them in the background. I wish the game had more background stuff that moved more. For an example in one race map their is a wind turbine and it looks good but it never moves. So its a mixed bag. If I was rating it I would give it a 7/10. The other thing is the price for $20 dollars I would never buy this as its to expensive for what you get. For the price of $5 to $10 dollars its a lot better looking at this price. I paid 5. Also this is not an arcade game but more of a lite simulator. You cannot go full bore thru the corners as you will crash out. So you do have to watch the throttle also you can customize your bike for suspension and gear ratios.			",299,147,32,35,36,9,44

This is consistent, widespread, well-known, and will never be fixed, at least not by the developer. There are also some graphical bugs, but they aren't as persistent or intrusive.I paid $5 for this on sale.

												This game is pretty good! I bought a week after it came out and I still play it now in 2015. The graphics are great, the career is very fun, and the photo mode makes for some awesome screenshots. This game does have its flaws though, the rider is kinda stiff on the bike, you can't customize your rider or your bike except for the number and the helmet, and you cant throw whips the same way you would in most other MX games. I personally love racing with the 1st person camera in this game, I think they really nailed the behind bars feeling that you get when you race. Overall, great game... but if you could customize you gear, bike, and upgrades and throw your own unique whips this game would be so much better! 4/5 stars.			",47,1,9,2,4,0,1

												This is a really awesome game. It can appeal to those who really race and appreciate the physics of the realistic mode more, or those who just like to play a fun racing game. If you are wondering how this compares to other off road racing games, particularly MX vs ATV, this is how:-MXGP has really good physics and is less arcady than MX vs ATV (especially when you are on the realistic mode)-MXGP gives you option to set up your bike however you choose. This will probably appeal to those who really race or know a thing or two about it.-MXGP has a more realistic career mode, letting you choose a team to sign with and wearing your endorsments on your jersey and bike.-MXGP features all real brands, people, and tracks, unlike MX vs ATV (MX vs ATV only has KTM available as a real brand for dirt bikes)Those are just a few of the ways MXGP beats MX vs ATV. As far as the graphics and sound go, I'd say both games are pretty good there. MXGP does have nice graphics, but the animation at the end of the race when you win is just... unnatural.MX vs ATV give you more things to do, being a game that doesn't only focus on dirt bikes (even though that was probably their main focus).MX vs ATV lets you drive a bunch of other different vehicles like an ATV, trophy truck, and more. MX vs ATV also features more types of racing. It features supercross, motocross, enduro, and has free ride available.Things I wish were included in this game:-Free ride-Enduro-Hard Enduro-Multiplayer for each of those thingsOverall, MXGP is a great game for motocross enthusiasts and your average gamer alike. As for which of the two games mentioned are better, that depends entirely on you and the features/style of offroad racing game you want. MX vs ATV supercross is planned and hopefully supercross isnt the only style of racing they include because that is one thing that I do love about Reflex (the amount of racing styles available).Another thing is that MX vs ATV might beat MXGP with the real time ground deformation, but both games do it well.

												MXGP is an annoying game, it will ♥♥♥♥ you off when things aren't going your way and you're in last place crashing everywhere, but when it is going good the game is actually pretty fun. Playing with others is the only real option as singleplayer is just too easy even on the maximum hardest settings possible, so you're gonna have to make an account to play online for the real experience, if you are able to find a game and join it, well done this is usually a very hard task as multiplayer is buggier than the BF4 launch.Once you get into a lobby you have to skip through about 10 cut scenes to finally get racing, on the line the bikes are screaming in 8bit audio, as the race starts you glitch through the gate as it doesn't drop which is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, you rush to the first corner as all the players ride into eachother and take everyone out, it's not fun with collisions...Anyway once you're in the lead things are going well for yourself, until you go round a corner leaning about 5 degrees to the side you slide out and you're last, in frustration you try to catch up but in that attempt you fall off again, there is no hope, you leave the server and alt f4 the game and don't play it again for another month, true story ggPros -- It's a motocross game, which is rare these days- Fun to play with others- Good graphics on max settings- Lots of 4 stroke bike selections- Tracks are half decent even though they are scaled wrong- Terrain deformation- Good/fast customer support teamCons - - You can't lean into corners properly- Preset whips looks like you're just crushing your back into itself- The jumps are scaled terribly, 250's can't clear most of them and 450's overjump them all.- Keyboard controls are impossible, controller 100% recommended- No 2 strokes- Engine sound effects sound like a game from the 90's- Laptop dedicated graphics are unsupported- Kicked from multiplayer games which adds to your quitting percentage and is unavoidable- No multiplayer VON or type chat support- Expensive for what it is- Dev's never update the game			",77,9,11,6,4,0,2

												This game is a buggy mess and no patches have ever fixed any problems.  It seems to be a console game ported to PC and hopeless...Game has great potential and awesome pyhsics but is entirely unplayable in mp and also horrid sp experience.No user created content can be added also.  GG wasted 40 bucks never buying another game from this crew.			",34,1,9,0,2,0,0

												I'm not going to say it's the worst motocross game, but it's pretty bad.  I will do a pro and con list to start off.Con-ANIMATED SCRUBS?!?!?!?!  all of the scrubs will be the same.-Break tapping in the air does nothing and panic reving in the air has a small effect-Screen tearing without V-sync and with V-sync the FPS is limited to 30... -""Soil deformation"" Yes it changes visually but you can ride in the ruts you made.  You just kind of glide over it.-Can't put parts on a bikes-can't change colors of parts-can't ride 2 strokes (I wasn't expecting them to be in the game but it would have been nice)-no rev limiter?!?!-no manual clutchPro-Good graphics-soil deformation (looks cool)-Major brands/teams/tracks are included-Customizable setup of the bike suspension and gearing-realistic liestyle where you can see social media about yourself.-control of riders weight distribution-somewhat realistic riding-Smooth flowAnd somehow through all of this crap, it's still kind of fun.  Just not really a good game.  I would pay $15 for it TOPS.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the best racing game available! This game is realistic and very addictive!  Making a huge jump is very rewarding!  You can really feel the air time.  When you switch from the 250cc to 450cc you can feel the weight!  There is no other racing game like this one! Great for racers who want to keep sharp!  Easily the best racing game ever made!

												Hell yeah, I do recommend this game !No need for me to explain all in details because you can actually download the demo and try it yourself, but this game is a blast.First racing game in a while to hook me like that. It is pretty immersive especially with the helmet view, the graphics are sexy (except for the mud). You can cbe like me, and know nothing about it and just play, you'll get used to pretty fast, or be an expert and change the options to realistic.After their ""mud"", this one can stand proudly, and I think we should show the dev team all the support we can because they improved a lot of things to make a much better game. It's to bad that this game doesn't come out in many countries because the didn't find any publishers. Show the support, they need it ! We need it to have more games like this one, only better, because they proved to us that they work to make amendment of their mistakes by making better with another try!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay, I'm writing a new review for this game. I did reccomend it when it first came out, but I'm not misleading anyone. AVOID IT! unless you like to be unimpressed, angry, or have a shop full of breakables that you can destroy once you realize that this game hasn't been patched for almost a year(Its only been out almost a year) and the patch they released didn't help any ""Real"" problems.Need some proof that I've never been able to get online? Look at my achievements. The only ones I'm lacking are the that require online races. The Devs told me that ""Everything was fine and I should be able to connect with no problems"" HA What a joke. I got off the phone and instantly tried only to have the same issues.The Devs don't care. They get your money, then they are on the next sucker (Myself included)It had alot of promise, but no way would I recommend this garbage now once I've seen how the Devs have addressed the bugs and complaints. They did NOTHING and will do NOTHING for you or any of us.If you choose to burn money do it with a lighter instead of burning it on this flaming pile.I give it a -34/10     As in I want the $34 dollars back I spent for it, but I won't get it. Once again... Dev's heads up their asses.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

No matter how fast or slow you hit something it almost feels like the game is going to put you where it wants you. Cornering physics are cool, however the berms suck and you blow right through them. I guess it just further cements that EU riders like inside/flat corners. But given all that, it's still a fun game and it'll hopefully improve in the future.

												So far, I have only played the single-player campaign (career) for a few hours, still I can more than recommend this game to any MX(GP) fan. The handling/feeling on the bike is great (I solely drive in First Person View), graphics are good, player models are good, tracks are great (and resemble the real ones quite well). Animations could be better, but what should really be improved are the sounds of the engines. They don't feel authentic and sound like generated by a computer program (as they most likely are). Also, the in-game menu is a bit sluggish, but that's definitely something I can live with.While there are things to improve upon, this still is the finest MX game I have ever played and seen. I have to admit, however, that the last game of this sort I have played was ""MX 2002 Featuring Ricky Carmichael"" on PS2. Small tip: I'm currently using the XBox 360 controller for PC and would recommend to any player to choose it over a regular keyboard. It works flawlessly out-of-the-box including force-feeback, or whatever it is called nowadays :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you enjoy motocross games, get MXGP.  That's as simple as I can say it.This is a great combination of sim and arcade, so you can tailor the experience to fit your style.  Personally I am not very good so I play on Easy level with assists on and enjoy winning about 80% of my races.  But I played a few races with the assists off, and a few on harder levels...and it's pretty unforgiving.I used to love Moto Racer and Motocross Madness and I still occasionally play an MX vs ATV game now and again.  This game has a great motocross feel, plus a career mode and of course multiplayer!  I haven't tried multiplayer so I can't comment on that.  But the career mode is fun.Again, if you're a motocross game fan, stop reading, get the game.  (Well, okay...maybe wait for the Steam Spring Sale.  But if you like motocross you really can't go wrong here).			",177,50,35,30,115,11,22

												Hardcore MX fans will love this. Controls felt strange compared to Reflex but once you've given them 30 minutes, you're laughing. Would recommend to any MX fan!**EDIT**Having played this a lot more now, I'm going to write a half decent review.Firstly, I will go onto the base game. As you can see the game is officially licensed, and as such contains most if not all riders, teams, and tracks of the Motocross Grand Prix. Bike sounds (MX2 and MX1) and physics have been faithfully re-created (I'm playing with 'pro' physics enabled) as have the decals and gear etc. The game plays very well, and any fan of the late MX vs ATV games will feel right at home with this having had to deal with the goon riding of 'Alive' (Although Reflex was outstanding imo).The career mode is basic yet very enjoyable. You begin your career as a wild card rider in MX2 for one of the lesser known teams, and compete in various GP's all over the world on the very well re-created tracks. By earning points and beating rival riders, you become more established and begin to attract fans and offers from various teams. Your team will set you goals of how many points you need to achieve, although failing to do so repeatedly apparently sees you losing your contract with that team (I've not had this yet). Bigger and better teams such as KTM/RedBull, Honda, Suzuki/Rockstar etc have more demanding goals than the smaller teams, and require you do maintain at least a top 3 position throughout the season. Doing well enough you can either transistion up to MX1 (Where the bikes are considerable more powerful and harder to handle) or choose to stay at MX2... The choice is all yours. In terms of gameplay it plays very well. I'm currently running at max graphics and audio setting playing with a Windows Xbox 360 controller, and the game recognised it immedietly (no controller mapping required) so I can't comment on what a keyboard plays like. Rider animations are extremely diverse/dynamic and feel very life-like so it's all good in that department! The graphics are very good, although some people may notice a few crappy textures here and there, but rest assured the level of detail on the rider gear, bikes, tracks etc is more than pleasing. You can scrub too, nuff said.The game did receive a few poor reviews which I think (upon actually playing the game) were very unfair. Most reviewers we're expecting an arcade style racer and based they're reviews upon that assumption. So don't knock this one MX fans, this is I think the most fun MX game I have played in recent years! (I've played most too). And to play on real tracksa with fully licensed bikes and sponsors is a nice treat too.Now on to customisation, which is what most people like these days. You are free to choose the manufacturer of your bike, all the nice toys are there (Yamaha, Honda, KTM, Suzuki, Kawasaki, TMRacing). However, different teams use different bikes, so as offers come your way be sure to check the model of the bike before you decide what team you're going to sign with! (You get multiple chances to change anyway). You can choose from 12 (I think??) set helmets which come with preset goggles, your rider gear is determined by which team you are signed with. As far as boots go, I have no idea. The AI in the game sport boots by Alpinestars, Gearne, Fox etc so I'm not sure why the custom rider is stuck with Sidi boots! As usual you can pick a name and number, as long as that number isn't in use by one of the pro riders in the game. Most players will be pleased however, as there are a lot of teams to choose from all with unique gear so that should satisfy most players. In terms of expansion, I see a lot of possibilities. I see most people asking for 2 Stroke bikes, but any real fan of the MXGP would know that they do not race 2 Stroke bikes in the MXGP, only 4 Stroke. Again, they're going for authenticity here guys. I would like to see more tracks added to the game, be they fictional or from other parts of the world (Glen Helen anyone?), or maybe even a track-editor so people can create and share tracks. Who knows. Anyway, I hope this review helps. I'm overall very pleased with the game as I haven't had a decent MX game to play since I got insanely bored with Reflex (too many hours, lol) so this is a breathe of fresh air. Happy racing dudes! 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Enough room for adjustment of difficulty levels as well as motocross bike. Have a nice pastime diffrent game likes. Referral! :3FIN:Tämän hetken ylivoimaisesti realistisin motocross peli, jota olen pelannut. Varsin Hardcore motocross peli, jossa on todella hyvän tuntuinen pelattavuus, jossa maaperällä ja pyörän ohjaamisella on väliä. Teköäly osaa ajaa ja se on älykäs. Riittävästi säätövaraa vaikeustasossa sekä motocross pyörässä. Hauskaa erillaista ajanvietettä pelistä tykkäävälle. Suositteluni! :3			",452,105,67,38,78,8,80

												In short: biggest disappointment ever!The game looks great but after half an hour you get bored as the gameplay is shallow. As I bought it at release I hoped patches would fix the bugs and the devs would ad more depth. Now after a long time of not playing I tried it again and I am so disappointed that nothing has happened since release.You can't control the throttle in the air, so you can't control the bike in higher jumps. The breaks I never used (never had to). You basically hold down the throttle and lean from left to right and if you are still awake after 3 laps you realize that you won (again!). ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The RBR of motocross:I wasn't all that impressed with Milestone's WRC series, but having raced, collided and wiped out in real life, this one blew me away.My pros:-Bikes generate ruts, and the track changes during the race.-Independent center of gravities for bike/rider and independent wheel physics...During a wheelie, you can push a wheel down on a high speed turning woop and turn slightly (great one at the start of Si Racha).-Landing sideways or preloading the suspension on a slide will snap the bike back and forth to the point where the rider gets thrown over the bike (nice!).-If you're scrapping to clear a double you can bunny hop some to help clear a gap.-Track friction and berms make sense.Cons:-Takes a few hours to make the controls feel like a bike. It's just part of the deal though. Not really a complaint.-Scenery a bit dull for today's graphics, but bikes look great.-Scrubs felt a bit baked, but it's alright.With a few tweaks, making an enduro/Dakar/Romaniacs out of this game would be fantastic (even if it was one race). A separate game for Trials would also be pretty cool. I think these guys could pull it off.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is obviously an incomplete project, Sound - there is only 1 sound for the motorcycles, and the sound is like a garden tiller.Graphics - Arena lights do not effect the riders or the bikes, or the people in the audiance. Every animated object looks like it is made out of unlit plastic. No Ambient occlusion, No shadows. Looks like they where 3/4 of the way done and stopped paying their artists.Monitor support. - Vsync needs to be done with your Graphics card override, or you are locked at 30 FPS. I could go on, but I am done wasting time with this abortion.This is what games look like when they run out of money, and they stop paying their people.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Err... no.. this is up there with the worst motocross games I've ever played. The bike is near on uncontrollable, yes you can tap tap and barely accelerate and get your way around the track but as soon as you put any speed into it, it becomes ridiculous. Sure it might be 'realistic' but who wants to play a racing game where you can't actually get any sense of 'going fast' ? It feels like you have to crawl around the track to stay on it. (you can actually win being all 'gentle' on the throttle).			",109,14,10,4,9,1,12

												From the very moment you change your riders helmet and color of the your name badge you wonder is this it, well your in luck aside from the minimum amount of customization that is offered comes a action packed Dirt Bike sim there is so much more.The Bikes look perfect, almost the same as if i was looking at them in real life,the sound is decent, altho mine cuts out after 40mins or so.the tracks are amazing and offer a decent challenge.you control the bike and rider with different joy sticks, which seems a bit wonkey at first but once you get the hang of it its smooth sailing. One thing that i am dissapointed with is the lack of modifactions that one can perform tothe bike, I want to be able to buy parts from my bikes supe them up a little bit.I dont find it a game that i can sit down and play all day long but its fun to hop on for a hour or 2 and tare up the tracks.Buy it you wont regret it.I Give this game a 8/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is Motocross at its finest. Im not trying to make this game sound any better than it really is. It is truely what mx fans would love to get their hands on. I have played many dirtbike racing games, from motocross madness all the way up to this game. This one is the mother of them all! Now, granted you probably won't ever see this game on the top seller's list on Steam because it's like a special interest type of game. Of course anyone can pick it up and play it. Its fun for the whole family! But die hard dirtbike fans will be in awe by this game. Every rut can send your bike out of control, technique is sometimes more required than full throttle speed, Even on the easiest difficulty it will take some getting use to when you first start playing like with any game. But trust me and others that have recommended this game, it is the most authentic motocross game you will experience up to this date. So if your a long time fan of this sport, do yourself a favor and throw away your money on this title, its well worth it!!! 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played the demo of this game, and thought it was kinda meh. Wasn't something I really thought I'd enjoy. Few months later I'm writing this review because I was wrong. This game is a sleeper. The career mode is top notch, you start out in MX2 and have to race your way to the best teams in MX2 and then work your way through MX1. The ground physics are amazing, the air physics need some work, but ground physics make up for the lack of feeling in the air. The AI is pretty good, they are really hard when you let them get infront of you, its a challenege to catch them, but once you are in 1st, you can walk away pretty easy. I heard there is a mod to make the AI stronger, I plan on doing that soon.			",59,3,27,2,16,1,2

												It's pretty a decent game, in fact I enjoyed it while it was running at 60fps with the various fixes applied to the vsync from Radeon Pro. However this fix did revert back to the 30fps after a few days use and I can't get the game running above that any longer.So until the game has a 60fps option working properly in the game without the need for external programs to fix the issue then it's simply unplayable for me and for that reason I cannot recommend it at this time.I'm using 2x R9 290X's in a OCUK Infinity Tesseract PC and the game runs like a one legged dog at the moment. The screen tearing is so bad that it isn't playable, its the worst I've seen and even limiting the FPS to 60-63 causes major stalling issues.I wanted to give this a good review too.

												Everything I've wanted in a Motocross game and offers many things that are lacking in AAA racing games as far as the actual racing is concerned. The riding mechanics are deep and satisfying, graphics are great, and the AI is perfect in my opinion. This title is from Milestone, a company that creates racing games truly focused on the actual racing. Just like Moto GP 13, this game puts you in a Career that encourages you to learn the track before race day by offering Practice and Qualifying sessions before the actual race. This makes MXGP a highly rewarding racing experience, when racing on the highest difficulty you will need to know your way around the track to earn the medal. I'd recommend MXGP to anyone interested in an authentic racing experience.			",137,20,16,6,8,3,8

Whipping in the game is pretty cool but I wish it had more style to it to make it a little bit more exciting.

												When trying to compare this game to similar competitors, it's clear who the winner is. This game has amazing graphics, physics, and sound compared to any other game of its kind. Although the ruts don't really do anything, and the revs die mid air, and there's no real mid air movement, it's easily better than any other MX game. What's disappointing is that the game consists of many different 4 strokes, but not a single 2 stroke. Fair enough that during the 2013 MXGP season there weren't any 2 strokes competing, but you've still got to give people the option to ride one. Maybe during rider customisation there could be a choice to make your own bike, and that's where the 2 stroke could come in, but we don't even have the option for that. The game gives many hours of gameplay, online and offline, and there's many different tracks and bikes to choose from. The game has full controller support (thank god), as it would be impossible to play without one. Overall, I'm pretty impressed. All I want to see is 2 strokes, and some DLC, and it would make the game one of my favourite games to this day. A few bugs to be fixed, but like every new game you need to give the developers time to fix them.			",134,21,4,13,11,1,29

												Honestly, not the best. This game is  ""The Official Motorcross Videogame"" and they give you very restriced control expecially in the air. No clutch, and when you are in the air you have to hit the gas twice to make the throttle go. Needs clutch, rear brake and front control sepratly and when you are in full ""control"" of the rider. Give us a REAL mx game. Otherwise the racing is pretty good along with career, just gets old fast when yo uhave no control of the rider. In the current state of the game without these key parts incorporated into the game, I do not recommend this game...			",80,6,9,2,11,0,0

												This game has a lot going for it, but falls flat in some very important areas.  On the good side of things the career mode is killer, it’s a really cool idea that keeps things fun instead of just grinding away races for no reason.  Getting interests from teams and getting picked up for new contracts ect.  The game falls short with the actual riding. This is kind of what’s important here.  The in air controls are just horrible.  You can't use any gyro effects of the bike to pitch or throw cool whips.  If you try to do a whip it auto corrects you and you will always land, and you can't do a low scrub using the gyro of the bike.  The jumps all seem pre-determined it doesn’t seem to matter if you seat bounce, rail a corner and come in hot you almost always go the same distant.  The ruts develop after racing, but seem to have no mesh behind them, you just ride right past em, There is no getting cross rutted or railing a rut.  The extra lean with the right stick also doubles as the button that makes you auto scrub, so if you try to use your weight in the air to land in a rut you end up doing a scrub and falling. Also if you try to lean into a turn to rail it hard if you catch any air from a bump while railing a turn you start to scrub and fall.  It doesn't seem the right stick actually has any sensitivity it might as well be a button press.  There’s no clutch or starting gate, you just sit there holding the throttle and you go.  Makes getting a holeshot a tad easy. Also with no clutch it doesn’t let you keep traction railing through turns and resort to riding different ways to counteract it.  The vsync is messed up and holds the game at 30fps, if you shut it off the screen tearing is unbearable. You can work around it but forcing vsync for the game through your graphics card as they have pointed out, but it kinda seems the pc version is an after-thought.  There are a lot of random bugs with the audio not working, the bike disappearing in your pits or the rider disappearing from the bike, the achievements don't work right, the list goes on; just go read the forums.  I’ve read on there that the multiplayer is a huge hot mess as well, but I haven’t even tried playing online yet.  They had a great idea, the graphics look good, the career mode is great, but I mainly play MX games to shred and this one you just can't. I'm still working through the career mode, but I basically end up wanting to fire up my 360 and play alive or reflex and just throw some dirty whips, feel like you're really killin it.  I expected a lot more for the price of the game, I don’t expect the air controls to get fixed if they did that would be huge. It would make the game so much damn better.  ",57,4,21,14,24,0,2

												Oh my, where do I start?THE BAD:- 30 FPS lock with V-sync enabled and no way of changing it to 60. This game is unplayable without V-sync enabled. If you turn off V-sync the screen tears are everywhere.- Sometimes while playing your sound will cut out, once that happens you have to restart the game all over again just to          regain sound.- FULL texture models such as YOUR BIKE will completly VANISH. Guess what? Once again you must restart the game.- When using the ""third person"" view of your bike the camera angle will go crazy on tight turns. It feels as though the camera will snap 180 degrees and back again.- When using ""first person"" mode and landing after a jump it feels as though your players head goes through his own body and all of a sudden you're trying to drive a dirt bike from a stomachs perspective.- Overall gameplay and re-play value seems really low, I've experienced all these issues within ~1 hour of play time and the couple minutes of ""working"" game time I got to play got REALLY boring REALLY quickly.- Feels like a really bad port job overall.- This game is just BROKEN and UN-PLAYABLE 90% of the time. Immersion is a big thing when playing super realistic games, and when you have to stop and restart the game several times just to get a few minutes of playability, it really ruins that immersion effect.THE GOOD:The graphics are somewhat nice?The Physics are good enough.The race tracks seem to be real race tracks from around the world.Conclusion:I was looking for a fun yet realistic dirtbike game, this looked promising.I don't know what else to say about this game, the trailer videos got me excited for a realistic dirtbike racing experience and completly dropped the ball. At this point I'm actually going to use Steams Refund feature to get my money back. Honestly even if this game was on sale for 50% + off I would still NOT RECOMMEND it as it just simply un-playable.			",80,9,7,6,22,0,3

												I absolutely love this game its unlike any MX game ive played before, with over 14 legit mxgp tracks from all around the world and many replicated dirt bikes to choose from, like: Suzuki, KTM, Yamaha, Kawasaki, and Honda.  It even comes with famous professional Dirt Bike Riders to play as from all around the world.  The Career mode is absolutely amazing, you have a manager and you get offers from different companies in which you could either decline or accept. For example I got offered to ride for a company in which I would have to ride a KTM, and so I accepted it and now I ride for that company.  While in Career mode you can customize your character, get new helmets, change jersey number, change jersey name etc.  You can also check the calender for upcoming races in which you would have to qualify and practice for which in my opinion is quite helpful because you get to Know the track as you practice on it before the real races actually happen.  This game also offers  Multyplayer (although I would like to see more players playing on these  servers, that is one of the main reasons I am writing this) anyways it is quite fun to hook up with some friends and race them against AI or play with other random online players in a huge race to try to get a holeshot.  So it's your choice, do you want to sit on your butt all day playing the demo and wishing more MX games would come out........ OR! are you going to buy this amazing game for NO! not $59.99 but $39.99. It is your decision but I recommend you make it a wise one.SEE YOU ON THE TRACK!-Scootiemgee			",99,10,9,4,6,1,2

												This is just a short review of the game.If your looking for authenticity then this is the game to deliver on that. I personally got this game for the career mode,which i might add is just what i want.If you have played MotoGP 2013 then you'll be familiar with the career mode, for those of you who havent then a quick overview:You start out by creating a rider (personal data,appearance,number etc) then you are giving a wild card ride to choose on an MX2 machine, this happens for the first 2 races choosing between the lower level teams. After you have managed to complete both races you are offered a ride to compete on for the following season and so on.I was quite the critic about this title due to the terrible MUD they released a couple of years ago. Dont be put off tho this is 100000 better than that, i have to add im enjoying it.Yes it has its faults, but on the whole if your a big MX fan like myself then im sure you will enjoy this title.Cons:LAST GEN technologyPoor AI (pro & realistic settings) No matter how hard you try to battle and not win, you still do.Poor Scrub/whip control. The right thumbstick controls your ""scrub"" much like reflex, except it is nothing like reflex, its actually just a pre scripted mechanical move that you have no real control over, this lets the game down imo.Clutch: No clutch.. yes i know, a motocross game with manual gears, no clutch? hmm.. good one Milestone!No support for the game and a dead online racing community.There are probably a few more cons to this game but my satisfaction of the career mode is dominating them right now so i really couldnt care.

I suggest you get a controller because if not, its hard as ♥♥♥♥ to play because you need to move the rider and the bike (with the wasd, and arrow keys) Sounds for the bikes are a little un realistic, expecially in the beginning of races.

												The first time I played this I didn't care for it - it felt ridiculously hard and like the rider was eating it for no discernible reason. But I gave it another shot and paid more attention to what I was doing, and as I started to get the hang of it I found it increasingly rewarding. Over the course of a few race weekends in career mode I moved the difficulty up from Easy all the way to Realistic (max). I'm still playing with semi-auto rider controls because I just don't care that much, but it's fun.There is quite a bit of variety in the tracks, both in their layouts (flat, very hilly, fast or technical, and so on) and in the surface. I came across tracks where I could not get a decent lap time until I changed things in the bike set-up, which speaks well for that. The surface of the track in this can look kind of janky at times (frequently the ruts don't render until they're behind you) and the engine sounds could be a lot better, but I'm really enjoying it and I think it's very much worth buying on sale.Previous MX games I've played were MX vs ATV Alive & Reflex.

												If you love dirt bikes and the off road then you will enjoy this game. The graphics are well done (Minus a bit of terrain pop in. Much better than Reflex though in that regard) I found the AI to be pretty good ramping it up as your skill goes up. You can race with bots online which is a big plus in racing games for me and my friends. Internet games went flawlessly, some people lag but thats just because they are from different countries. Not many play this online but it's a niche market anyways.Definitely worth the purchase on sale, even more so if you are a fan of riding.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First, don't let the screen shots fool you into thinking they're only from a prerender cinematic. No, these are in game results that quickly grab your eyeballs and attempt to pull'em from your sockets!Unlike most motorcycle racers out there, this one definately requires you to pay close attention to not only your speed while cornering, but the use of rider leaning plus turning the bike. Yes, you better let off that throttle else it's into the hay stacks, crowds, and trees.Very, very different--and not made easy by default! Even with all driving assists enabled, and NPC racers AI set to basic, you will need some patience and determination to succeed at avoiding last place or DNF ranking in every race.With that all said, I love this game. Although only scratching the surface thus far, it looks, sounds and feels as expected in a true racing sim. And don't get me started on the personal satisfaction of riding over my buddy, laughing my head off and suddenly taking a dirt-dive myself. Now we both laugh!			",189,107,19,16,7,0,4

												So I bought this game as a long time MX vs ATV player and can safely say that its one of the best Motocross games on the market.As a rider myself and a fan of MXGP the tracks are very accurate for the most part, the teams are cool and the riding is cool.It takes some getting used to but after you crack it, it's really enjoyable.PRO's: - Great fun- Great teams + bikes- MXGP accuracy- Cool you have sponsors on your gear etc- Great for the price- Full career mode of MX1 and MX2CONS/Needs for the next game:-Needs more variety in the social media and team email system, if you win 3 races and then come 2nd you get a load of hate mail and your team manager is dissappointed... I mean come on thats just dumb.- Needs physics modding a little, its still a little stiff.- Varying Careers, its a bit boring after you complete it.- Red plate for the points leader.- Cairoli wins every qualifying which gets a bit annoying, I ended up trying to knock him off and make him come as lower place as possible to give other AI a chance lol- Multiplayer lobby system is badOverall its a good fun game which any MX rider would enjoy, it has serious potential when they make the next one.
