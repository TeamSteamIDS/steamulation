												I can honestly say that I have played better games, but I will tell you that throughout my years of gaming I have never come across any developer that was as quick and determined to fix a flaw for a customer as these guys! They worked on so many different solutions and stuck with it until they found the culprit and was able to fix the game for me to finally play it! That in my book warrants two thumbs up in my book. Customer service isnt dead after all!			",577,185,42,106,89,7,74

												No, Witcher 3 and Skyrim it isn't. But the game doesn't take itself so seriously as to aspire to such hefty goals to begin with. It instead has the goal of simply having fun with the action/adventure genre. I would likely recommend this game for parents who sometimes struggle to find appropriate content for their kids on Steam (like I do). And it's kid-tested, as both my daughters (age 8 and 11) gave it a play. The graphics may not be spectacular, but they are as colorful and inviting as a Saturday morning cartoon. The characters are likable, and fully voiced, which adds a nice touch. The blood-free battle system is incredibly easy to use, requiring virtually no technical skill. The fairytale story is simple to follow and goals are easy to understand. Overall, it's an entertaining (though a tad oversimplified for the older set) game appropriate for all ages.

												For the LOLs!!!I have been thinking for quite a while whether I should give this one a thumbs up. Actually I've been thinking so hard about this review that I couldn't sleep well at night and dreamt about this game XDTruth be told it is quite crappy at times. Voice acting is so off it is funny!  Same goes for the script, even though that is intentional by the devs. (Just think about those crappy B or even C movies that are so bad they are fun again)While the game does run stable and never crashed on me, there are some glitches. Most annoying one is the Archer, as whom you start playing. Sometimes it just won't hit, especially when your target is close to a tree or in a partly covered position as are enemy archers at the beginning of the 2nd area. However it is not too much of an issue, because enemies don't do that much damage and there is quite an abundance of health items.Graphics are nice to behold and go easy on the eyes. Quests are always clear, including objective markers on the map.Overall I can recommend this game on a sale, when you are looking for something crappy yet strangly enough entertaining in a funny way (or maybe it's just me and my way off humor!).

												Uncertain why are there so many short and negative reviews,complaints about the game crashing, unable to start etc...Had no problem at all.Gameplay is rather smooth and fluid.Graphics are bright, colourful and well drawn.Dialogues and short-scenes are actually well done and entertaining.Switching between campanions to utilize the playstyle in different situation or encounters.Stationing the meleer behind a bush, using the archer to shoot the enemy archer and lure the others towards the bush for the meleer to engage.Having a fine time, although there are minor issues with crosshair and aiming being the archer.Achievements require replaying the characters to attain.Starting the game in Hard mode gives more experience per enemy,does speed up the process of getting enough skill points.It is easy to attain every skill achievements individually by playing carefully for the first three maps, using the heroe's initial skill such as Aimed Shot and Thunderclap, gather Experience skill to 5-7 points and saving at intervals.with enough Skill Points to level up the furthest skill, max out the skill individually by reloading the save and allocating the skill points.Understand the story missions are rather short and few, could use more updates and expansions to widen the game.Could easily be a greater game,which is a pity.Initially just thought of purchasing for the purpose of Achievements and Trading Cards.Now I do feel its a proper buy.Recommend to play if the price is low.

												I received this game for free from Free Games. It is a comedy action RPG featuring an archer Alesha, a staff fighter Dobrynya and a sword and shield fighter Ilya who decided to band up together to help the nearby farmers and villagers with wild animal and bandit problems. This game is easy to finish, with an estimated playtime of 10 hours provided skillpoints are not used until a game save is made and the save is used to obtain all the 3-star achievements for each character's skill. Combat is simple and easy for most of the game where each character's normal attack is enough to defeat most enemies. Some of the fights get a bit more difficult where Dobrynya is at an obvious disadvantage against archers and sword and shield enemies who can strike very fast and slow him down. Most of the skills in all 3 characters are also not very useful, with only a few skills that are really needed to raise to 3 stars to win certain types and groups of enemies. Furthermore, when the other 2 heroes are following the controlled character, their AI could be better in helping to defend the player from enemies attacking them from behind. Quests have sufficient variety and humour. Although all quests have objective markers shown clearly on the game map, some quests become impossible to progress and complete due to faulty NPC AI pathfinding. Graphics and soundtracks are decent. Recommended when at discount or bundle offer as the game has a few bugs that might be annoying.			",638,594,10,116,100,5,75

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: You basically have a fairy tail start, the archer and hero Alesha has come out of retirement because bandits attacked him and he turned them into pincushions. (A sentiment I can respect, being an avid ranger/hunter/marksman/bowman main in other video games.)He goes to get the help of his two other friends Dobrynya who fights with a staff weapon, and Ilya whom fights with the bread and butter: sword and shield.Gameplay: Each Hero has a different fighting style, and a set of talents they can choose between while leveling up. Experience is granted from kills and completing quests. Just a pro tip right now: You cannot unlock all of the skills to max in a play through, so choose wisely. (ACHIEVER NOTICE if you're going for the achievements, save up your skill points before you spend them. Then save before hand and then reload to get the achievements. Also there are tons of auto saves, so even if you miss something you can reload the level you missed.)


Skill Tree. You can get the achievements easy by saving up skill points, saving them spending them all and reloading.

As a whole, I didn't find the game to be too unpleasantness, for the first hour or so Three Heroes is very entertaining! But then you start to feel like somethings not quite right... It starts with the awkwardness of the controls. Don't jump... just don't. it slows you down, the only time you'll use it is if you're stuck on something. Also you cannot move and attack (which is agony for someone who loves to kite in video games).Lastly the music gets a bit repetitive (so I turned it off), and the voice acting is borderlines awkward and annoying, and awkward and funny. It's right inbetween.The 3d models are rough around the edges, and one of my favorite effects, is when you use a special pole vaulting animation with Dodrynya, when after he launches himself HE RAGDOLLS when he hits the floor. It's hilarious, I love it!

Conclusion: So here's the thing... I've played some games which are right in between being good and bad and I decide I think they're bad because they weren't interesting, or had mechanical problems which took me out of the game.This game is definitely in between, some mechanical things should be ironed out. But It's clear the developers are actually trying. Each character is distinct and different and has different controls. (And making a whole 3d game as an indie team? it's pretty uncommon to make a game which feels like it came out of the Play Station 2. Most indie dev's will make an RPG maker for the hundreth time, or go a pixil art so they don't need to 3d model or program as hard.Kudos to  Cats Who Play for actually taking this route with their game. It won't appeal to everyone, some people will probably hate their game. But as long as I can recognize the good with the bad, I enjoyed my time with the game, it didn't over stay its welcome, and if you're looking to support an indie dev, go ahead and give Three Heroes a try.Thank you for reading, as always I'm Atratzu and I approve this review.

												MOTHER RUSSIA. HEROS OF RUSSIA. This game is a cultural history lesson on Russian mythology. or Slavic to be exact. The Mother land is under attack by bandits and ruffians and well just badguys.  Starting with the archer hero Alesha you join up with the other 2 heros by doing missions and learning the diffrent fighting styles of each hero. Illya is a sword and sheild kinda guy and Domrynya is a ''shaft'' its is called, user. Collect weapons and items in true RPG style sence and level up the heros to fight and get rid of the filth in the Motherland. Full of missions/quests on maps or areas to complete with lots of story. Switiching between heros and using their unique abilities is key to some of the missions. It makes it puzzle like sometimes. A little gimic with the usage of 3 main characters. I like. They will kill and maim all bandits eventually. They shall find a way .... I think that that cool part of the game is the cultural story of telling you or giving you an idea what these Slavic myth heros were suppose to be like. The music is on que with the cultural and diffrent but enjoyable and the graphic art style is well artsy. ''Comic '' like. This isnt all dark and grimy like The Witcher or Darksiders solo RPGs. Its a good intro for upcoming video gamers like my own 10 year old for exp. Thel get into it and learn how these games work. I enjoyed it and I think if your a fan of Gilgamesh or Hercules mythology with a Fable like feel. GO FOR IT.			",77,12,0,17,2,0,18

												This game is absolute crap. I couldn't play more than an hour because it felt like a massive waste of my time. The game will randomly decide certain keys just don't work anymore and give no input. For example my esc key decided not to work 25 min into the game so I could no longer pause or change my key mappings, or do anything that uses the esc key at all. So I rebooted and it worked again, only so that 25 min later my M key did not work so I could no longer use my map or select quests... I uninstalled immediatly afterwords.			",182,44,0,23,3,0,9

												I bought this game because it looked good, I was looking for a casual game to play, and it was cheap.  As I read reviews, the biggest complaint was that controls were terrible and it was really hard to actually hit enemies.  I also noted that players making such claims had generally logged under 1/2 an hour of play time.  I now have 13+ hrs of game play and rest assured, once you get a better bow, targeting gets much better, plus your special abilities also make it easier to hit and kill enemies.  Another complaint is that the voice acting is terrible and that the translation from Russian to English is pathetic.  Although it's true, I'm actually finding it endearing.  It actually fits the game, the graphics, and the story.  It's quite funny!  In terms of game play, it isn't just hack and slash.  There is definitely some strategy involved as the authors have created situations in which you can't simply charge in.  There are also some non-fighting puzzles involved.  I heartily recommend this game (4 out of 5 stars).  It's fun, funny, and the plot is fairly interesting (based on a Russian fairy tale) with casual game play so you can play for 15 minutes or 5 hours at a time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although the game is pretty and I wanted to like the idea of it, I didn't get on with it very well. I found getting stuck on invisible scenery and on other characters who won't move to be highly frustrating as well as the target system and just how terrible the bow plays. I had a lot of random instant deaths for no reason (such as after a cut scene for a conversation) or how if you touch water it instantly kills you as well. It seems to be bugged if you can enter it or not. If you die, you have to start from your last save which you have to manually do so and if you forget - you start from the beginning again. Pressing the hot keys for controls randomly stops working (such as being unable to bring up the map). Mobs behave randomly. I was mauled instantly by an entire group of wolves after a cut scene. Next try they ran at me one by one. Had the same issue with a quest to kill some boars. The game also decides to end your go for you because it doesn't like you being close to the bandits rather than letting you have a chance against them. Felt very forced.Too many bugs and a very annoying combat targetting system which just makes the game frustrating to play, rather than enjoyable.			",238,80,0,77,32,0,66

												I will change this review if an update can address the basic issues with this game. Fix the contoller support. I'm fighting the camera angle. Add more feedback like a sound effect when I hit something. I hit a bull and visual feedback is not enough.Enemy should react with a noise, one for pain and another before an attack. Music is great, but a great track does not make up for lack luster sound effects.Yeah combat is painful and I understand other reviews. I'm not saying there has to be gore, but maybe some better animation or effects when I hit something would be nice.  Overall, this game has a light hearted feel, but it is not playable and feels incomplete or early access.			",106,24,0,14,11,0,7

												First Impressions:I was actually suprised by the general quality of the game in some areas. The graphics in particular are pretty and colorful really bringing alive this Russian folk lore theme they seem to be going for. I also find the music is pretty decent but it gets pretty repetitive after awhile. There is not any major bugs or glitches that I have experienced yet either. The game also ran very well for me. The combat is not terrible, but the major problem I have with it is the lack of feedback. There is not hit SFX making all the combat feel pretty lame. It is a shame really because besides that I thought the combat was pretty ok. You can use a variety of different moves that have different uses and you can switch characters for certain circumstances. I really feel that they can patch some SFX in or something to improve this. Also I am not sure if this is possible but I feel the game would be better with Russian voice acting because as it is the English voice acting is terrible. It really takes away from the overall feel of the game. If they can add combat hit SFX and Russian voice acting with English sub I feel this can really be a pretty decent game. I can really tell the devs actually put some effort into this one which is not always the case with indie games on steam. Also it is a fairly unique concept as well which is cool to see.

												I do not recommend this game at all! There are tons of much better , yet much cheaper games like this on Steam.To make it short, gameplay ruins everything. Controls do not respond well. Movement and animations are very slow and feel artificial. You start with an archer , but you cannot aim regular shots at all, even when locked on a target they can miss. And the ""special shot"" you charge with the right mouse button misses its own crosshair! Plus, you need to land a lot of shots on the enemies to kill them. The enemy closes the distance , you cannot turn away from him and need to kill him with a bow.This was enough to make me give up playing very , very early and did not want to try anymore. I am not going to judge the english translation as I am not a native english speaker.			",1444,496,25,183,140,7,192

												I was gifted a copy of Fairy Tales: Three Heroes for review purposes by the Steam entity, Epic Quest Games or ""EQ Free Games.""  It's so neat to see videogames based directly on a cultural history/mythology (Slavic).  I once took a course on Russian folklore & found some familiar elements here.  Tragically, every other aspect of the game (aside from art) is a letdown.Before now I'd never heard of Cats Who Play or any game they've developed.  Probably won't go for more of their stuff until I see ample proof of their improvement with time & experience - & I'm speaking as a gamer with a wide-ranging appetite for indie creations.  On paper the concept is great: three distinct heroes, an adventure & a villain all inspired by Russian lore/history.  Unique skills & mechanics for each hero.  Something was lost in transition from concept to game.Clearly skills & targeting don't work as well as they ought.  Auto-aim penalties & poor responsiveness in player controls render investment of points into certain skill trees a waste.  The entire experience of player movement, jumping, strafing, pathfinding, etcetera is as clumsy as the combat.  Nothing is intuitive; gameplay is at times painfully dreary.Triggers for cutscenes & events are occasionally misplaced, leading to events being out of sequence.  It'd be hilarious if I weren't actually trying to finish the level.  A few bugs caused crashes, or led to inconveniences like a missing mouse pointer or launch failure.  This doesn't alt+tab well at all, either.I played on Normal, given the choice of Easy, Normal or Hard.  Doesn't matter all too much since combat is wonky; hitting enemies & surviving battle depends as much on whatever's happening behind the scenes as on your input!Localization in English is fairly poor.  Grammar errors, laughably awkward voice acting, misspelled or entirely incorrect subtitles.  It just took me out of the moment.  The art style is quite pleasant - very bright & colorful with clean lines.  The music seems fine for a low budget indie; I'd say low to middling visual/audio production quality.And yet after all this, I still found the will to play all the way through to the end.  My first attempt wasn't great.  I came back a few days later & willed myself to finish the game in one full evening of play.  Conceptually it isn't bad at all!  The game's just rudimentary in so many ways that it is at no point a compelling experience.  The single gratifying moment for me was seeing how Hero-specific mechanics were worked into completing an objective that utilized the folklore stuff.  I won't spoil it.I don't want to be too harsh in my review; I respect the effort that goes into creating even a small game.  With design tweaks & significant technical overhaul I'd happily play, on whichever platform.  Unfortunately I can't currently recommend Fairy Tales: Three Heroes.  A shame, as I was curious at the outset to see what could be done with the folklore angle.			",374,114,5,75,36,6,79

												I got this game for free so it only deserves a fair opinion.I only played it for like 5 minutes, I did not find it engaging at all, the graphics are colorful and runs smoothly, but I am guessing this game is aimed for little kids as it is all cheerful, the music is a bit too upbeat for an action RPG. And the gameplay is really basic. Voice acting is mediocre at best.Good if you want to have your kid busy with something, but not for adults.2/10			",90,3,1,7,3,0,14

												Fairy Tales: Three Heroes is an action-adventure game featuring cartoon-styled visuals and easy-to-learn gameplay. Play with three characters of famous epic stories, each with unique skills. As the player, you control one hero while the two others accompany him. At any time, the player can change for another hero and control him. You can improve the skills from level to level, and also provide the party with new weapons and equipment. There are four different regions in the game, each with different environments and different villains. 5/10 very good for indie.			",109,9,3,4,1,1,1

												How about instead of making a review, I just tell you my game-experience:As you start you notice the broken english and horrid VO right away. It attempts to be funny, but gets horribly down due to that (and the gameplay, but we get to that later).You start as a bowman, with a bow. You know... those weapons where you almost have to crawl into somebody to hit anything? Yeah, I didn't know bows required that either, but you do here. Gameplay pretty much consists of walking backwards and killing things point blank.Then I got a few quests. I found someone who wanted 2 guards to ambush a bandit camp. After finding the guards I also found the camp and killed them all. No ""camp is already slayed"" dialogue, nope, all enemies just respawned instead. One of the enemies is a bowman, who also uses hit-and-run and has as horrid an accuracy as you do. So the best way to fight them without having to run the entire map is find an open spot (since pretty much everything can intercept your arrows) and then just wham away at each other for about a minute till the other is dead (since they can't hit you either, *and* your hp regenerates).Killing it it dropped a +55 damage bow... sweet. Except it also reduces speed by 30. The default speed is... uhm... slugh, and there's no sprinting. NO, WHY? WHY? Why would you want us to go even slower? I want faster, not slower dammit... well, guess it's keeping to killing slowly too but atleast walking slow, just not uber-slow.There also was another quest to gather 3 parts to get a better bow, but the questgiver just said he would ""meet me later""... guess what... nothing at all.Cue area 2.Here you get a melee guy. Not much different since you pretty much meleed already but atleast he has AoE and a decent attack speed, making it all the less annoying to play. Weren't it that melee hits interrupt animations (including attacks and specials) so most of your hits get interrupted, and using your special is pretty much not done unless they're chasing down your AI ally who's fleeing again like a bowman all over the map... ugh.This area starts with sheer horror as you need to kill 4 bowman in towers. Behind some kind of wooden shield. Yup, have fun going 2 minutes each to kill them just missing 90% of your shots.So learning about the bandit camp I went in, bad move, instant gameover. Didn't save, had to re-do archers... NOOOO. Anyway if you want to play this game, save often, you never know when you just get insta-game-overs.Finding the appropriate spots, running so sloooowly around, murdered another full camp, had to jump over water... missed. You guessed it, insta-game over. Second time it worked but upon returning it triggered a cutscene and my char was stuck in the ground halfway during it. No biggie I thought, nope. Insta-game-over.Succeeding, you need to walk to point X, then ALL THE WAY around the camp (soooooo sloooooow) to point Y, then X again (WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?). Supposedly I was supposed to force my AI to stay there but I didn't so the cutscenes got really funny with a non-existant talker, and in the end my archer just was amongst the enemies chilling they did nothing when he shot all lumber bars ontop himself too, but he survived while all around him died. Did I mention this game is buggy?The villagers were happy, they were saved, they wanted me to kill a stronghold. Wait, the one before? Yup, indeed. Again, everything just respawned once more, aside from 2 tower guards (thank god with how bow gameplay works).After that area was over besides 2 sidequests which required me to jump water again and walk alot (failed once, insta-gameover) and one that forces you to hunt bunnies around the whole map (did I mention a lot of slllllllllllllllow walking).The rewards? More weapons with speed penalties! AAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh.Why? Why? WHY?This game could be fun, the humour is there, but the horrid gameplay, the slowness (even without -slow weaponry, and ALL weaponry has that), bad translation and even worse VO completely wreck it's neck. Let's start by removing -slow from weapons devs, please?			",1377,703,32,175,157,15,227

If you play alot of rpgs and this is like a quid then it may be worth it for the writing and the (stunning) art style but i cant recommend for 7 pounds.

This game is like my ex-girlfriend, the only difference is that, the game its more funnier, and you actually have a good time as it lets me do what i want.If i could go back and choose between this and my ex, i would choose this game, atleast you can ask for a refund if it dissapoints you...DRUM.You get what you see, not what you buy for, dont expect crazy graphics and gameplay, as a friend said when he gave me a copy of it, t’s not quite The Witcher 3, but I think it’s fun, and i agree, the game is very fun to play, weird controls and gameplay mechanics, but unique if i do say so myself.Worth a buy/price if you wanna have a good laugh, as its humor its priceless, but dont expect top quality voice acting, as its part of the humor.Now excuse me while i lay in my bed and think about my life and choices.10/10 Would choose again over ex-girlfriend.
