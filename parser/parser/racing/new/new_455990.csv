								A very fun and simple indie game. The premise is simple, you control a space craft where either your goal is to finish first, or be the last one to survive. It controls very similarly to an old Atari game and its very easy to pick up and play. For what you pay for, it's a cheap party game to play with your friends.Check out my play through with my friends

								This game has become a standard for party style games in my library.  This game is surprisingly complex, and can be very competitive.  It's easy to play, and the ships have stats that differ slightly and lend themselves to different playstyles, whether you want to be the first to the finish, or destroy your opponents right off the starting line.  It also has catchy chiptune style music, if you're into that.If you have multiple xbox controllers and friends, I highly recommend this game.  The more players the better.			",244,38,5,23,12,1,10

								Smash Pixel Racing, in my opinion, is an extremely fun shooter to play with friends. The music is great, the artwork is cool, and the community is active. Not much to say about this game besides the fact it's a great time killer. My playtime on this game is actually a few hours, so don't let 0.1 hours fool you. Steam's having issues integrating the playtime on this game as of now.			",708,151,21,61,65,5,53
