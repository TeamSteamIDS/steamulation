												Quite fun when you have the friends to play with (up to 8  Multiplayer :D!)Hard to find an online game at this point.  I recommend getting it if you are able to entice your friends to purchase copies as well.Gin approved.			",2380,1084,95,269,340,18,349

												The Concourse made by A & B Game studios can be compared to games such as Mirrors Edge which I thoroughly enjoyed for the parkour running. This game although looking good in the photos is poorly optimised, lacking single player bots or an actual tutorial while you are playing. The developers have not updated the game since my first playthrough over a week ago even promising to add ai, the multiplayer is dead so you will need to have a friend which owns the game to have any sort of competition or fun. I did like the idea of obstacles, however when sliding under moving blocks the hitbox was buggy and ruined the experience. There is no timer when playing single player, no way to track record times on a course and the developers promise to update the game with features that should be in the game at launch. At the moment, all reviews made on this game are from community members with few reviews claiming that the multiplayer is active, although less than one hour has been played of The Concourse by the user. Other reviews focus on recommending the game, I simply cannot recommend this game at the current state unless the devs fix the issues with gameplay. This game has potential with the idea. I truly wanted to recommend this game, however, is poorly executed and simply is not fun. *Please do note that I have received this game for the purpose of reviewing it*			",1754,670,91,194,218,23,257

												Panda Likes: I love the neon graphics, music and gameplay and to put it simply... this is a cool game to play with a group of friends. I played a few 4-people races and it was super fun for a while especially since you can shoot disables at your friends to slow them down, reverse the controls etc. inbetween trying not to get lost in the maze (especially with the longer tracks, just make sure to find the direction of the flag arrow before the race starts) and parkouring the obstacles. The quality of the graphics is awesome but I will warn those with laptops and lower-end PCs that this might lag for you as the game lagged slightly for me with my i7 2.8GHz, GeForce GT 630 and 16GB RAM setup. It made it quite difficult to pass some of the moving obstacles as they switch positions very fast in the race. Overall, its a really cool-looking, fun party game to play with friends.Panda Dislikes: Unfortunately there isn't any leveling or reward system for playing the game, so I wouldn\'t recommend this for anyone going SOLO right now as the server doesn't seem to be very populated either. It was a little disappointing as I do think this game is cool and all that but I think this is more of a one-off game, definitely not one to play often unless your friends are up for it.Panda Verdict: 3.5/5 - I love the aesthetics, gameplay and idea but it seems to lack a few things that would make it a popular game to play in the long run.

												(I did not recive this product for free)This game for only being  month old id a good game, its sort of like Mirrors Edge but you are competeing against other players. Although it could still use some work and some more players it is still a great game, although there are bots in this game, I would HIGHLY reccomend playing with freinds or waiting for a game. The bots still need alot of work as they were only relesed 2 weeks ago. The develpors are always opn to suggestions and are usually on the game playing! Overall if you want a quick game that isfun to play with your freinds, I would reccomend this!			",61,6,4,5,9,0,6

												I'll start right away with a suggestion... sell this in a multi-copy pack, for this is nothing but a multiplayer game. It'll be ideal and extremely fun to play with friends on a casual level. The game would also benefit a lot from local co-op! That being said, at the moment very few copies are out there, therefore finding a random online match is nearly impossible. I feel like this game has a lot of potential, and perhaps would've benefited from a program like ""early access"", because the game is clearly not finished yet. However I can't give a good game a bad review because I know it will get better over time.The devs already stated that they are working hard on adding a lot of new features suggested by the community, so I'll be looking forward to that.

												The Concourse is a fun game based around dodging obstacles and sabotaging your opponents. At any time during the game, at the cost of ability points that generate over time you can use one of three abilities, ice which makes your movement slippery, confusion which flips your controls and camera, and a movement restriction ability which freezes you where you stand.You can also press shift, which activates your shield. With your shield on, your movement is completely stopped but attacks get reflected back at your enemies that attack you.The game at the time of writing this review has very few obstacles, and the multiplayer is nigh empty. Despite this, I enjoyed playing the game and I believe that with time it will become extremely fun to play and with more players, the fun will only increase.			",122,22,1,18,19,1,9

												I\'m not a big multi-player person, mostly because I suck at them.  But this is addicting.  It\'s a competitive footracing game, with moving obstacles and randomized race tracks.  There is no single player mode, but there\'s also nothing here that would make it necessary.  The visuals are neat, I really like the designs and colors they went for here.  There\'s a view for 1st or 3rd person, also which is nice, you don\'t see options too often.  I prefer 1st person myself.  It\'s fast paced and a bunch of fun.You can get in and out of races really quick, so you\'re not stuck wasting time not playing.  You get different powers that you can use to trip up your opponents, which can sometimes change the outcome of the race entirely.  I still suck at MP, but found myself winning a couple rounds here and there, just due to some well timed powers and luck.  You get a freeze power which freezes you in your tracks, another power which reverses your controls, and also one that makes you slide everywhere like there\'s oil slicks on your feet.  You also have a shield that you can use to deflect attacks if you time it right.All that with the randomized tracks and moving obstacles make this a fun challenge.  It\'s not contending for any GOTY awards, but it\'s definitely worth the $10 and it\'s a fun distraction that doesn\'t require a lot of commitment.  I\'m looking forward to seeing what else they do with this.  Get a group of your friends together so you can scream obscenities at each other over skype or whatever and it\'s a blast.

												This game is extreme fun to play. The idea behind this game is unique and inovative. We played a few rounds and randomly ended up in a lobby with a dev. They have so much ideas and in the test build you can already see what might end up in the game.One thing to notice is, that the community is very small at the moment. So bring your friends or ask in the forums for people to join you (;			",71,2,2,2,5,0,5

												I have played this game for nearly an hour now really fun! The only downside is that there are not enough people. It seems like a great game that you can play for half an hour or while you are waiting for a friend.I am looking forward to more games of these devs , because for their first game its really great.Basic discription for the game:Its a jump and run game threw a labyrinth.You got a cannon with three charges there are diffent shotsthe first one is an ice shot it slows and prevents you from jumping it cost 1 charge.the second one is a shot that inverts your movement and costs 2 charges.the third one roots you and and cost three charges.I can recommend it really fun.

												I have played 5 rounds of the game so far, it is really enjoyable and a good laugh with even 1 friend, let alone 8. The game looks excellent at max settings, this is due to the use of UE4. it runs well too, Im able to get 50+ on my 960 maxed out (even AA) which IMO would be expected on my card in this engine. The downsides: movement feels clunky sometimes, specifically head bob and passing obstacles, the barriers seem to pull you with them, making passing harder, whereas the flating platforms to cross the drops just fly out under you, dropping you. The barriers need to do this too and not pull you or the platforms need to pull you so you dont fall off.I would recommend this game, it is priced quite cheap and is made by a small team too.

												Well, only 1hr in this game so far, but I already like it very much. I got the chance to play with the devs and some friends in a multiplayer match. And we really had a blast!! I teared up from laughing so hard while playing this game.This game has much potential in my opinion. Multiplayer is sooo much fun. It's like a parcour game with funny attacking elements: You can either stop another player from being able to move, invert his keyboard and mouse controls to confuse him or ""icing"" him, so he can't relly run or even stop. In addition everybody is struggling with the obstacles which are pretty annoying - I mean by playing the game, not annoying in general. It's just so much fun, playing this game with other players and TOTALLY worth the 10 bucks.The idea is great and the devs are going do improve the game and add new features in the future. They already have a lot of ideas and about to integrate them.Overall a great party game for up to 8 players. Looking forward for new stuff being integrated into this game and many people buying this game so one can easly find opponents to play this it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
