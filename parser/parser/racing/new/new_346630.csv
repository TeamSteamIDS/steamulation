												I got this in a bundle and for the 29 cents US I paid, it was fun.Think of it as a very simple, single entity (dual personality) version of Trine.  Very much so in that the Thief swinging mechanic and the Wizard telekinesis mechanic are extremely similar.  Death is back to the last checkpoint and there are alot of them so the frustration factor is a little lower, despite some tricky spots.  It is shorter than Trine and at times a bit more of a grind, but it is a decent and very underplayed game. At 4.99 it is hard to justify, perhaps 4.5/10, but in a bundle (and it has been 6 times according to Enhanced Steam), it is an easy 7/10.			",1512,672,63,204,237,16,336

												'Plazma Being' is a 2D platformer, it's based on the ability of re-placing the objects and manipulating the enviroment in order to solve the puzzles. Puzzles are good enough, though they are not surprising you when you solve them. They might be pretty easy to solve and it's fun trying to find a way to the solution. However the physics in this game are not so complex and it makes this game kind of dull when it comes together with the generic art syle. Also, it takes time to restart when you fail. I wish there was a faster and easier way to do it.Overall, it's a solid game with a few flaws but definitely worth a playthrough if you enjoy platformers.			",901,255,40,115,121,15,124

												If you want a nice puzzle platformer with some story, not too long, and also you can live with fact that it is an indie game, so graphically not the best (but great mechanics in the game, and gameplay > graphics), also if it is on sale (-75% = 1,25 euros), go for it, you can spend nice 3-4 hours in this game (3,3 hours is my game time, i've completed whole game and also achievements in that time :) but i really love these kind of game, so i have an advantage :) ). Is it hardcore platformer? No, but some parts can be, especially last level, with boss. Is it hardcore puzzle game? Not really, but again, some puzzles can be harder, and you have to work with gravitation and game's physics. Is it worth 5 euros? I think yes, i've enjoyed this game, and the only con is graphics (not really my cons, as i prefer gameplay, not graphics :) ).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fairly short, and surprisingly challenging. Pretty similar to some of the wizard parts of Trine at first, with some swinging around in later levels.I'm not sure if it's worth the full price, given that it's only 10 levels and maybe 3-4 hours, but it's a good deal if it's on sale or as part of a bundle.

Would be great if some more levels exist where you need to use your different abilities.Achievements level: Easy			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played this prior to its release on steam and put a good number of hours on the desura version.  It is one of the better indie games that i have played in a while.  A puzzle based platformer with mouse control.  It is well worth 5 dollars and strongly recommend it at a sale price.  I am also looking forward to the Dev's next game ""Systematic Immunity"" Which is on steam greenlight now.Graphics are good, puzzles are great, I wish that it was controlled with xbox 360 controller but the game really doesn't easily lend itself to that.

												First of all, beware of the spoilers in the video and screenshots on the store page. I didn't watch the video until after I played the game, and I was amazed at how many solutions to puzzles that it contained. Now onto the review.This game was a hidden gem for me. I was in the mood for a game that I could comfortably play in a weekend. I liked the idea and the look of the graphics of this, so I gave it a shot. I ended up enjoying this far more than I thought I would. It also took a bit longer to play than I was expecting, but that was mostly due to me getting stuck on a couple of puzzles. I got a great sense of satisfaction when I did figure out the solutions, and they always felt reasonable and logical. If I stopped playing and came back to it later with a fresh set of eyes, most of the solutions seemed obvious.Generally the game is all about using your brain to solve puzzles, but there some parts that test your platforming skills. It had a good progression of adding abilities to keep the levels fresh. It was impressive how well the puzzles were made to use all the abilities, and even at one stage had a puzzle based on the sound made when selecting the different abilities. Some people have complained about the short length of the game, but I don't think that adding any more levels would have resulted in any new type of puzzle. I was quite happy with the way the game ended.Performance on low-end systemsThe game plays perfectly on my netbook powered by a 1GHz dual core AMD C-50 processor at 1024x600 (below the minimum spec). The minimum resolution is 800x600 (why don't system requirements ever state this) and it supports windowed mode. It also worked surprisingly well using a trackpad instead of a mouse, although I did my full play through on my desktop system so I only tested the trackpad on the first few levels.

												The game has a good story, but it is simply unpolsihed in the logic puzzles. the physics of some objects make it extremely difficult to get around and the puzzles sometimes will get you stuck in such a way that you have to restart the game to redo that section of the puzzle.The physics are VERY awkward and some objects actualy defy physics by stopping pre-maturely. For example, there is a swing puzzle in the game but they will not swing further than the ""stopping"" point they have designed in them unless you use the kenisis powers, and you fall off if you use kenisis while you are on them. second, the swings swing FASTER not FURTHER when you ""Dance"" on them throwing off timing for your jump.By the time i got to the first part of the puzzle that forces you to restart the game to do it over I put the game down and decided i wouldnt play it anymore, the game is simply too unpolish to be enjoyable.

												Great puzzles. Simple, but challenging and never unfair.Be careful: Before starting, the game asks if you want to enable the charging teleport. I thought this was some kind of cooldown for a teleporting skill (so I disabled it because I hate trial & error), but it only means that you need to collect energy charges to be able to use the level exit. Enabling it doesn't make the game more difficult because the levels are linear - it only means that you get to play the game a few minutes longer and that you will get an achievement in the end.

												Plazma Being has an enjoyable, albeit simple, storyline and some innovative platform/puzzle mechanics. There are multiple character modes which allow you different options to interact with the environment. These modes, when they are initially found, will trigger small tutorial pop-ups, followed by a simple puzzle that requires the use of the new ability. This is an excellent feature and greatly assists with the learning curve of the game.The music/sound effects are simple and generally relaxing. Graphics are simple and highly suitable to a platform game.Controls are typical WASD for movement with the scroll wheel of the mouse being the default to cycle through the character modes/types. Overally they are generally responsive, however, I have found there does seem to be some delay in jumping which can result in one ""skidding off"" the edge of a given platform.The implemented physics are above average for games of this type and generally make logical sense. However, velocity of blocks et al. can be unexpectedly fast at times--with what one would consider a minor movement resulting in a block flying off the screen.There are two tiers of saves. A general save slot which stores one's overall progress and waypoints within given levels. As the puzzles are very specific (although there is generally more than one solution--intentioned or not given the physics in the game) you will find yourself reloading to waypoints akin to Groundhog Day. This can, as with any waypoint system, become very tedious, with otherwise simple puzzles becomming more of a chore depending on finesse level. The waypoints are, however, common enough, as to generally make any reattempts quick.I have enjoyed Plazma Being as a relaxed platform/puzzle game and originally purchased this when discounted. I have, enjoyed the game enough that when the opportunity presented to get a free key I responded to the forum post for such and have since given out two copies(I was given 2 keys not just one) of Plazma being to other individuals.The game can be frustrating in that Groundhog Day/Edge of Tomorrow sort of way. However, taken in small bites, it is a very well designed platformer and well worth it's price point (which is very often discounted by coupons or general sales).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Only 2-3 hours of gameplay, the controls are a bit unintuitive, twitchy, and difficult to master, and it's not particularly exciting. In addition, recognition of which objects can be interacted with in which ways is very difficult, leaving an average player quietly perplexed with the lacking game design.But the mechanics are solid, and a few of the puzzles are quite elegant and satisfying to solve. Imagine starting out on a simple platformer, having the powers of the wizard in Trine. Later you gain the Trine thief's grappling hook, and a limited ability to teleport into certain objects. None of these additional powers are explored to their full potential.I give it a positive review because it's worth playing around with, if only for the unique feel of the game and its combination of mechanics. However this game has a lot of wasted potential. If the developer were to come out with additional, more complex puzzles, with better level design, and more variety to the environmental mechanics, or open it up to user-created levels somehow, it could be a beautiful thing, a la 2D Portal.

												What a wonderfull little game that is! Such efforts should and must be rewarded. Play it. Highly recommended!EDIT: After finishing it, all I have to say is that we need more levels. Or a dlc. Or a sequel. We need more games like this.Go play it NOW.20/10.			",27,20,0,2,2,1,0

												Starts out well but after the first boss gets difficult very quickly.  It doesn't help that the blocks you can teleport to are round.  The slightest brush against them sets them rolling away and they never stop rolling.  You have to hurriedly stop whatever you were trying to do to rescue them before they roll out of your reach, or worse, into an abyss somewhere.I ran into an area after the first boss where I only had a lockable block and a teleport block to work with and could see no way forward with just that.  I managed to drag two pieces forward from the prevous puzzle to help stand on, but still couldn't get quite far enough forward.  Then on the next try one of those two pieces I was trying to stand on got knocked into they abyss.  I pressed L to restart from the last checkpoint, and the piece that had gotten lost was still gone.  So now I have to start over from the start of the level to drag the piece forward with me again?  Forget it.  I'm done.  Fun while it lasted I guess.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
