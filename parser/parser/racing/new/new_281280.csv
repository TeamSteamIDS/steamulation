												This is a fantastic party racing game from mid 2000's.  I know the description says 'Single player', but rest assured THIS GAME SUPPORTS 4 PLAYERS SIMULTANEOUSLY (local) and 360 (also directinput) controllers work well. The game isn't splitscreen, all four players play on one game screen, like most party games. If you like Towerfall, SpeedRunners, Gang Beasts, Starwhal, Nidhogg, Samurai Gunn, then you should check out this game.Be sure to put in the only cheat code to unlock everything, to maxmize party time fun.

												I don't believe it. 'Mashed: Fully Loaded' is one of my favourite games of all time. It's one of the best battle racing multiplayer games ever in my honest opinion. However, this is not 'Mashed: Fully Loaded'. This is the first game, 'Drive To Survive', which sadly, isn't nearly as good, with a pretty bad camera and a lot less content.I still recommend Mashed, but I am confused and saddened on why they chose to release this version instead of the greatly enhanced Fully Loaded version. It was a terrible decision and seriously makes me very sad. The game is still a pretty good racing game with weapons, and is still a ton of fun with friends, but seriously, releasing this version is like... well... think of it like if they released the original Devil May Cry 3 on steam instead of the special edition, and if the original had a bad camera and half the content of the special edition. Or if they released 'Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater' instead of 'Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence'.It's a terrible idea.			",707,105,29,46,38,2,74

												Quickie: Does this game SUCK: NO.  Is this game AWESOME: YES!Longie:OK guys, forget all the noobs and wusses you are seeing in the reviews for this game. This game is a GEM. Not a casual game, not a racer, but a MICRO MACHINES style Vehicular battle game. You race, untill one car is destroyed, or, reaches a certain lead. You then are awarded a point, the action is reset, and you do it again. Play to a certain score to win. If you have 1 or more reasonablly skilled gamers to play with, you will: Laugh your ♥♥♥ off. Have intense battles over said points, Blow eachother up with missles, explosive barrels, and other flamable items....  tumble down cliffs, power slide, jump, flip, roll, burn...  Ontop of all this?!? Right now, it's onsale for about $1.  Holy hell, get it and love it. FULL, effortless 360 controller support.			",167,64,9,22,11,3,21

												One of the greatest, this games 4-player action is intense to no end, and will leave your apartment in ruins.I first started playing this game back on the original Xbox, and we probably played this game daily for 3 or so years.Picked this gem up recently on the summer sale for something like 0.79€, I didn´t even know it existed on the PC.I´t impossible to not taunt and laugh in your friends stupid monkey faces when you ride past blasting a couple shotgun shells making them tip over. But you´ll get new friends.Dare I say this is the best competitive top-down, local multiplayer racing game ever? I do.Pros:Intense multiplayer gameplaySweet weapon attachments for your rideSolid tracks to raceCons:Your friends will hate youNot the ""Fully Loaded"" versionNo online multiplayerConclusion:Buy this game, even at 5€ it´s a steal. You will not be dissapointed.			",265,32,8,16,7,2,21

 ""Mashed? MASHED POTATOES!"" When I was little I bought this title off the Xplosiv publisher and must admit that its by far the most amazing top-down game I've ever played and felt that I've spent my money right with this title. Played multiplayer with my cousin on the same screen and the insults were undeniably the most outrageous and funny ones. You'll get called a dumb cookie crumb and so forth, which adds even more icing to the cake.Yet, the whole sad thing about this is the fact that this is Drive to Survive, not Fully Loaded so there's not any improvement to the gameplay and I've stated the bugs you'll encounter while playing. Gameplay It's all about survival, or more like mashing your opponents just like potatoes.  MASHED POTATOES!  Anyway- back to the main point  I love mashed potatoes , you can mash your opponents with all kinds of hi-tech weapons like the lock-on missile that chases your target down (Only if you locked your target on the opponent). Furthermore, there's the machine gun that pokes the opponent's car with such violence that you can secure victory if used right. There are many tactics. But along with that... there comes the downs of it.I've noticed that the AI is extremely aggressive even if playing at the easiest difficulty. I've witnessed the opponent cars crashing into me just to drive me off road to my doom, which is a total suicide for just a point. It starts to become annoying because you can lose the match really fast like this. Another thing worth mentioning is the fact that the AI doesn't know how to use the mortar powerup at all. I know, it's just one powerup they can't use, but it matters. Yet, not only that is annoying, but the terrain seems to be deformed or bugged out. I had my car jump out of nowhere while driving in certain parts of the map and while using ramps to jump, especially at parts with bridges (In Nukov and Sierra it's a really huge problem) it gets frustrating. The car either stops at the ramp and falls down the gap which is instant defeat if playing survival or the chopper attack event. I suppose there's no fix for this. But anyway, it's a really great game and worth playing. It's so worth playing that I managed to forget about all those bugs and continued enjoying it. OST & SFX There's not much about the soundtrack, but heck, it's surely fitting to the theme. About the sound effects - you're going to get shocked -  This game, has INSULTS.  Really rad, am I right? Being called a dumb cookie crumb was never more fun! Thanks Supersonic Software! The voice acting is satisfying, nothing to whine about. Pros'n'Cons Pros+Huge amount of hours+Replayability+Multiplayer+MASHING+Nice powerups Cons-Track bugs Should you buy it? Absolutely! Sometimes it goes on sale at even one dollar, so it's worth it. But if you don't feel  like it and you own a PS2, you can get the Fully Loaded version off the Xplosiv site or Amazon.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group:  Original Curator Group  ",362,76,12,33,41,3,46

												Fun game. One of my favourite PS2 Era games.However when exiting out of the game, the screen went nuts after exiting, as in showed a heat map-esque version of my desktop which was slightly disheartening. Furthermore, I took a screenshot and it showed the desktop in normal colours. A resolution change solved the problem, but this should not be happening.This does not stop me from recommending the game, however this issue should be addressed.			",846,158,41,97,65,8,75

												Looking for a local multiplayer game to play with your friends at home all night long? This game is what you're looking for. Mashed is a racing game where the main objective is to win other cars by distance or by destroying them. Each racing session is composed by rounds where each round gives/takes points depending on which place you've ended on the respective round, the first who gets its points bar full wins the racing session. If you lose and the round is still occuring, you can airstrike others until the round ends. This game is a blast of a fun!			",138,24,6,19,13,2,16

												This is one of those game i playied constantly on my ps2 with my friends, its was one of those games (local) multiplayer games like Goldeneye and MarioKart that kept your friends coming back for more, simple in premise, excellently executed, balanced gameplay and easy for a new player to pick up.it always felt fair and it was your player skill that let you down not the game.These qualities make it a type of game that is hard to find these days. Nearly anyone (friends,family and even a Child can play) you can pick this up instantly and become a challenger the more players you have in game the more fun it becomes.It isnt all great though,there isnt any online/lan play, which is a huge shame, the graphics arent updated, yeah it isnt fully loaded but this actualy seems faster these days(maybe im getting old) they later released wrecked which had all the online  features i want for this but wrecked had lost its soul and this game has a bigger heart. its all core gameplay nothing else.the weapons in this youve see a dozen times elsewhere but they have a knack to them, the missle launcher causes soo much fun, you lock on, fire, watch it go, then if the other driver has skill will use it too hit another player, with the possibility of him crashing trying to do all of this at once.The chaingun seems just like a stress release as you fire the entire mag into an opponents backside just to set him on fire but use it on a corner or on an incoming bounching barrel and it all becomes clear, there are mines,a chaingun, missle, morter (my fave if your last) oil slick and even exploding bouncing barrelsI say hook this up to your big display/projector, get some beers,controllers, get some people to play and get wrecked sorry meant Mashed			",142,23,7,17,5,1,26

												I own the original version of Mashed on CD and i can tell you it is not the same. It's like a totally different game. Cars have weird physics, ramps as not as they are on the CD version. In this version you either lose the momentum too fast and fall or the ramp edge flips the cars (or your car gets stuck on it). Whoever made this port clearly chopped up some of the main mechanics of the game up.On the Tierra Piedra (the only map in the Demo of this game as well), you can find the glitches described above, the ramp 80% of the time flips your car or makes it get stuck. Also the bridge that you can find the guided rocket collapses when you pick up the powerup (this should NOT happen) and your car blows up and falls.On Angel Peak i got a bug where the car would clip through the map and fall to infinity until you restarted the race. This was in the first 5 minutes of gameplay might i add.In total i think i spent about 100 hours into the original game, i don't know why. It was fun but it didn't have the bugs it has in this version.			",287,70,12,39,59,3,85

												I'm kind of suprised seeing so many reviews here wholeheartedly recommending this game, seemingly blind to it's numerous flaws. I mean yeah, I can imagine this would make a great local co-op game, but how much you enjoy co-op games has less to do with the game itself and more to do with who you play with. But, seeing as I don't do local co-op, preferring online play, or just.. not doing it at my place at all, I rate it as I would any single-player game. Simply put, do you do local co-op at all? Then buy it at a discount, since I'm almost certain there are better local co-op games out there for the same price. If you don't do local co-op, don't bother. It's not the worst game in my library, but, there are too many design decisions and flaws that range from nitpicky, like the constant PG-13 taunting from enemy drivers, to ""why would they ever why"", such as the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera.I mean really, the camera might be the most formidable foe in this entire game, either artificially coercing the POV to display all of the racers as the track twists and turns (even in single-player) to follow the track and not your car, so you crash into walls and drive off cliffs, or straying so close to the ground that the field of view goes to ♥♥♥♥ and your own car obscures your view. You will get used to it, certainly, but it's just this unnecessary hurdle the game puts in your way, and it always seemed to find novel ways to ♥♥♥♥ with me as I progressed through the challenges.The moment I decided that forcing me through this game would be a waste of time, however, was when I was doing laps against 3 opponents, all of which were ahead of me. Two of them crashed into each other, hurdling each other off the cliff, but I didn't get to celebrate longer than two seconds, since they then proceeded to spawn one after another in my way and on top of me respectively, hurdling me off the cliff. So, uh, no.			",369,171,8,29,20,2,37

												In local multiplayer this game might have some legs under it, but for solo play this game is NOT what I expected. While I was hoping for a game like twisted metal or mario kart, this game has the awkward game mechanic of ending the race whenever you lose sight of your opponent. So the levels are all mindnumbingly short, but you won't have much time to enjoy them because the race will be over as soon as you wipe out on any turn. There are powerups present, but their low-poly models don't do much to distinguish them- I think they're different colors for different powerups but it's hard to tell what you're picking up. The AIs don't seem particularly effective with pickups, but that's probably for the best since any little setback ends the level immediately. The graphics are dated but alright, the sound is neither obnoxious or engaging. I'd like to believe that some form of multiplayer would redeem this game, but if you're planning on playing it solo, just skip it.			",338,63,18,21,25,1,32

												I bought this game because I was looking for a local multiplayer car battle game, and it cost only 50cents in sales.However, even at that price I'm horribly disappointed. Everything is wrong with this game. The way the cars behave, the way the weapons behave, the graphics, the sounds and music, everything. I was expecting it to be a lot worse than Mario Kart (the golden standard when it comes to local multiplayer car battle games), but it still surprised me in its badness. How this game could be released after playtesting is a mystery to me.Avoid it like the plague!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has easily the worst camera in any driving game I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot. The rest of the gameplay is also quite uninspired (controls, physics, tracks, dated graphics), the worst bit being the race mode where the game stops when you pull 50m ahead of your opponent (or vice cersa) for a short score tally and a restart - about as close to racing as a congested motorway.I can see how it might be fun in multiplayer, though.

												A game from when I was younger, and I feel terrible for not having played it for 5 or 6 years.I prefer the expanded version, Mashed: Fully Loaded, on Playstation 2, but hey, this game was €1.24 in the summer sales and is the same price this weekend, so if you needed a reason to buy this, that's definitely one good reason.Another good reason is that this is one of the best games I've ever played with 3 other players, and it has lead to some of the best fun I've ever had in games, and hopefully will again.

												Played this game so many countless nights with my friends. Don't watch the Steam play time ... I had it many years already. One of the greatest local coop games for PC. So simple and so much fun.Have to say its a little buggy from time to time. Seems to really depend on the machine your'e playing at. Sounds strange but to me it felt like that.Still a great game. 10/10 for local coop with 4 of you in front of a big screen. You have to most of multiplayer featueres by competing in not so interesting single player missions. Sond a PM to get a good to go save file tho. ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I totally reccomend this game.When I was a child I had a demo version of Mashed with one track and once car only. I've played it for hours, competing in the same race over and over. When I saw it on Steam I decided to get the full title.I really enjoy playing it and I think that all of you will. Don't worry about negative opinions here, on Steam. Some ramps are indeed bugged but most of them can be used without an accident by approaching through the middle with relatively high speed. Ramp on Terria Pierdra (not sure if I wrote it correctly) should be approached by the left side. Once again, I encourage everyone to buy it. It doesn't cost much but it's fun to play.

												Bought this for my Ps2 under the name ""Drive to Survive"" years ago (The original is called Mashed: Driver to survive, in North america the new version was just simply Drive to Survive). I think it was one of my most played games, local multiplayer was amazing. This version however seems to be the original version. Not ""Drive to Survive"" (Which was Mashed: Fully Loaded). The details of the differences are not clear between the games. Although it is clear Fully Loaded uses a new engine, and many bug fixes with a few more carsIf this was the Fully Loaded Edition (Drive to Survive for NA) I would say everyone needs this game right now. This original version is good, but visuals are not as great, and some bad bugs (ramps, really destroy the game), over all not as smooth. If you still have an older console around, get the Loaded/drive to survive version. If you don't, you might be able to get by with this PC version. Core game is there and its as fun as ever, but the forementioned problems do drop it down a few marks			",77,4,5,7,10,0,2

												As soon as you pick up this game you enjoy it. The controls are simple to learn and if you can't learn the defaults, you can change the controls on start up of the game any time you open it if you wish.When you play this game you instantly feel a hint of Micro Machines about it as the cars are weird, the power ups are simply too much for a real car and the tracks all have hidden features that make gameplay special.The driving is great, drifts are well handled by the game and collisions are also effectively managed. All of the cars look great. Everyone has the same car in each level so its pure use of driving skill and power up tactics.Although its a great game, there are a few things that could be ironed out to make the game that more special. On some courses there are jumps across ravines, rivers etc and on other courses there are side routes to jumps, sometimes when going up these your car just flips down the ravine (doesnt happen most of the time but its annoying in survival mode). As you see my playtime is 13 hours, this is how long it took to complete the game winning everything. Granted it took some time going over events I previously couldnt win but the creator should add a few more tracks and vehicles but each time a game of that track is complete, a random new scenario is made so you can replay stuff.OTHER than these few issues, I think Mashed is a great game and would give it 9/10.
