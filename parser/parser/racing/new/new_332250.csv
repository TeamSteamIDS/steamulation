Early Access Review
								The Next Penelope is a sort of top-down, sort of on the side view (but mainly top-down), fast paced action racing shooter game that's full of color, an interesting classic looking story, and challengingly fun.The game's really polished with minimum issues that usually accompany games in beta or alpha, so it left me playing the game in its entirety, at least the main campaign of the game, smoothly, and I enjoyed most of it.The look of the game is a mix of beautiful and colorful visuals, and an art style that reminds me of the late 90's / early 2000's for some reason. The games characters, and the way they are portrayed, coupled with the graphical effects, sound effects, great soundtrack, and the whole presentation, really emits a strong charm from the game which really reminds me of Mega Man X because of it's presentation, and that's kind of awesome.

The gameplay is fun and smooth, with the driving controls being simple, steering right or left, and considering your momentum while making turns to not bump into walls which will slow down you movement, or fall off and lose, but while it is simple, it's also challenging with how you have to time your movements with boosters, dodging bullets and missiles from your enemies or traps, know when to use your power, which is connected to your life-energy fuel where if you use a power, you're also using up your life-energy, so you have to conserve and collect energy to not get yourself destroyed.Aside from reasonably good races, and challenging tracks, and the good progression going from easy to ""impossible"" difficulty, with a nice level selection menu map, the game has boss battles which at first made me confused as I thought this was a racing game, but nope, it's a racing game with apparently boss battles, and they're fun and definitely changes the pace of the game from always racing, and each one is unique in a way that you have to use what you have learned from previous races and the ability you've again from it, to defeat / help defeat the boss you're battling against, so no boss battle is the same.The only thing that's bad I have to say about the game, is that since the game is in 2D, some parts of the track is designed in a way that makes me think there is a turn to make, leaving me confused every time I come across those certain part(s) of the track, unless I've played through that track so much that I've memorized it to not get confused.Overall it's a great game, and I love everything about it so far, and will probably enjoy the upcoming 4-player coop that it will have, and the extra content upon release or through its development, and for the price, it's a polished - in-development - goodness with an awesome charm.Shameless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.

<Disclosure - This game was provided free for review purposes>Aurelien Regard’s The Next Penelope is a futuristic reimaging of Homer’s Odyssey; old meets new in a stylish yet retro world of neon race strips and mechanical monsters.Upon starting the game we are transported to Ithaca, Penelope’s home world. We soon learn that it is under siege by Poseidon who is seeking revenge for the death of his son at the hands of Odysseus, Penelope’s husband. After a brief tutorial, Penelope makes a deal with Poseidon to track down her love in exchange for sparing her kingdom, and the odyssey begins. While the story shows promise, it quickly becomes little more than a quiet backdrop. Characters from Greek mythology such as the Minotaur or Arachne are introduced only to be killed off soon after. The conversations between Penelope and these characters also reveal very little about the plot and offer minimal insight into the characters themselves. While this is hardly essential in a title such as this, when employing such rich subject matter, it feels like somewhat of a wasted opportunity. The developer is to be commended for attempting to incorporate such lofty inspiration, and with more of the themes and characters crossing over into the gameplay this could have been an interesting tale, but sadly, what little story there is on offer is largely forgettable and likely to go over a lot of player’s heads.The gameplay is split between racing sections, which will often include enemy pilots, and large-scale boss fights. The racing mechanics are very simplistic, your craft will accelerate on its own allowing you to concentrate on steering and attacking. This was the first thing that seemed odd to me – it felt as though a lot of the control I would normally have in a racer was taken away by not allowing me to control my own speed. Braking is another option which is alarmingly absent and makes drifting on courses without barricades incredibly frustrating – on these levels it becomes a matter of memorising when and where to drift as opposed testing your reflexes and steering. Additionally, I felt the tracks were zoomed in way too much, making each upcoming turn a gut-wrenching experience. Racing against CPU opponents does however involve an element of strategy, as Penelope’s arsenal of weapons and upgrades will be essential to claiming first place. These power-ups include a laser beam, which can bounce of walls to hit foes, a grappling hook to clear debris and life-stealing mines to name a few. Smart use of weaponry really is the key to success, and failure is often the result of missing a shortcut, or recharge point. Energy will be required to use any of Penelope’s powers, but also doubles up as her health bar; this encourages ‘tactical’ use of powers and smart racing. The energy mechanic is sadly, far from perfect. Energy is all too hard to recover with too few recovery points on the tracks and too many necessary powers.  The boss battles are a mixed bag. Some of them test your racing abilities while throwing in obstacles or time limits; these are the most effective as they play off the mostly solid racing mechanics. However, a couple of the bosses are fought in enclosed arenas where the constant acceleration becomes your worst enemy. The inability to brake or even slow down makes it very hard to hit bosses and colliding head on with a wall will likely result in death as it is all too hard to turn around while your ship keeps bloody accelerating. These fights feel laboured as energy/health is too hard to recover; the result is a slow paced battle while you gradually claw back lost energy needed to attack the boss. These really are the lowest ebb of the game, which is a shame as they could have been an enjoyable challenge had the ship controls been altered to accommodate them. Thankfully, the final boss fight does just that and plays out as a side-scrolling shoot-em-up. This is exactly what the other bosses should have done – completely mixed up the gameplay rather than forcing the standard racing mechanics into an arena unsuited to them. This boss-fight is definitely one of the best parts of the game and it’s a shame the shmup sections didn’t feature as a bonus level.Visually, TNP is a joy to look at. It takes the best of retro arcade design and blends it seamlessly with high-resolution backdrops and animations. The overall aesthetic is comparable to other 80’s arcade style games such as Pac-Man tournament edition which uses the neon glows and particles on darker backgrounds to great effect. Penelope, enemy racers and bosses are all very simplistic polygonal renders which would look right at home in a Star fox game. The characters within TNP are all represented in a pleasant animated style, which effectively apes a western, 80’s representation of Japanese art style. Some character designs are more striking than others, with Penelope herself being a clear standout. The soundtrack is also suitably 80’s in its influences, incorporating elements of techno, synthwave and dance into a bass-heavy, adrenaline fuelled sound which perfectly accompanies the art style while never being too obtrusive. There is something very retro and charming about TNP, and its visuals and sound design are definitely some of its stronger assets. One fantastic feature in particular is the option to activate scanlines and a simulated arcade cabinet haze at any time by pressing (L3)/(F10). This highlights the game’s fantastic retro visuals and makes it feel like a genuine arcade experience. My one gripe is that after each death, this option seemed to reset and had to be turned back on -this quickly became a pain as I died a lot, which brings me neatly to my next point.The Next Penelope is hard as ♥♥♥♥. Now this isn’t necessarily a criticism: I’m no stranger to old-school arcade games and am even partial to a bit of masochism, but TNP demands perfection. Slip up once or twice and you will fail, particularly on the Acheron stages where there are no barricades. But when you finally manage beat a level, it feels great. Like all good arcade games, the true appeal of the game shines when overcoming a challenge. While the difficulty may not always be particularly fair (some levels and bosses were just cruel), overall I feel that the challenge on offer is solid enough to please arcade fans and even offer some replay value when attempting to beat time trials and unlockable missions.A bonus local co-op mode is included and plays a bit differently to the base game. Only one weapon is available and using it will place you immediately in critical condition. Additionally the camera will focus only on the player in first; fall too far behind and you’ll be wiped out. This mode is a nice little addition and offers some variation on the racing mechanics. What this game really needs however is an online mode. The single-player content, while fun, feels like a precursor to a greater challenge, which an online racing tournament would suit perfectly. Overall, The Next Penelope was a pleasant surprise. It pays homage to its arcade roots both stylistically and in terms of difficulty while presenting a sleek, polished experience with a variety of game modes on offer. The challenge borders on unfair and made me angrier at a game then I’ve been in a long time, but the achievement of completion outweighs the frustration. While I would have preferred a more focused experience, this variety helps to highlight each of the mechanics while offering a unique and diverse slant on the racing genre. The boss battles are a definite low point and the game is thin on single-player content, but the retro aesthetics and (mostly) smooth controls are enough to make this Odyssey one voyage you’ll want to embark on. For the work of a single man, The Next Penelope is a truly impressive example of what indie games can offer to the industry.7/10 ",214,43,4,31,8,3,13

												For all its explicit aspirations to be MicroMachines reincarnate, to me The Next Penelope falls far closer to the original F-Zero on the SNES, a game which easily captures my fondest memories of the platform and was one of the first experiences in my life which served to cement my love of gaming. The perspective might be more in line with arcade top-down racers like Rock’n’Roll racing, but the feel and structure is distinctly similar to Nintendo’s iconic futuristic racer. But calling The Next Penelope a racer is where things start to get weird, because while it seems on one hand to wish to recreate the minimal, fast paced style of 90’s racing classics, The Next Penelope is also equally if not more concerned with incorporating modern structural trends (such as leveling up and a heavy narrative focus) while simultaneously blowing out the scope of the game to explore genres which don’t necessarily work well together.The level of variety The Next Penelope attempts to implement at times boarders on an identity crisis, with new game modes and entirely different genres constantly being introduced and subsequently cast aside over the rather brisk 1-2 hour campaign. The level of experimentation The Next Penelope is willing to explore is compelling from a design perspective, and in certain ways allows the game to feel more contextually entwined with its cyberpunk Greek mythology narrative (a combination I would never have expected to work as well as it does), but more than that it creates a problem in the way progression is conveyed or felt. Because each race (or one off minigame) brings with it such a dramatic change in how The Next Penelope plays, often with an agonizingly high difficulty level, much of the game is devoted to tutorial levels explaining how these new ideas work. In a game this short it creates a sense of constant stagnation, as well as a fair amount of frustration given you are often only given one iteration on each idea, some of which are significantly better than others and I would have loved to see explored more (insert: standard races).When The Next Penelope plays it straight with its races it is often hugely entertaining, helped in great part by the phenomenal art direction which manages to reflect a recognizably Greek artistic sensibility while still adhering to a heavy scifi setting. But then there are all the times it tries to do something different, some of which work…OK, and many of which are actively bad in their design. Every boss fight for example is a torturous abuse of a great racing system, either by placing you within an arena which is impossible to navigate in a vehicle designed primarily to go straight, or choosing to throw everything out and build the game anew as a sidescrolling shoot’em’up. The Next Penelope is best when it is just you and several other racers on a looping track blowing each other apart in pursuit of the lead, but these sections are bookended by such bizarre deviations on an excellent formula that it rarely feels worth shoveling through the garbage to find what works.The Next Penelope is also really bad about making itself seem even smaller than it is, from how its level select screen is designed to the miniscule upgrade system. None of this matters, practically speaking, but it gives an impression of brevity and incompletion to a game which is already rather light on content, which left me feeling as if I wasn’t moving toward anything of importance far before I actually got to the end. It isn’t a problem with how much game is here, but that the way it portrays that content leads me to feel as if the game is just spinning its wheels and I’m wasting my time.And that’s especially sad because The Next Penelope could have so easily been great simply iterating on its most rudimentary levels rather than trying to reinvent itself with each stage. It’s a game in need of an editor, or at the very least a brutally honest playtester, to be there to reign in an admirable but overzealous ambition which is ultimately The Next Penelope’s downfall.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												This game has so much potential... I really hope they create a sequel or add more content!tl;dr:+ Gameplay is fun!!+ throws constantly new situations, playstyles and conditions in, never gets monotonous+ good presentation: cool graphical style, fitting music+ feels a bit like a mix of F-Zero and R.C. Pro Am+ good difficulty: starts easy, ends with lots of challengeso if you expect racing, this may not be for you- controls need some time to get used to- the camera is way too close! It's really hard to see anything, this makes the game more about memorizing than racing- unlocking bonus missions is wrongly explained in the game- short, took me 2.6h to beat the singleplayerLong version:I love games like F-Zero, but there hasn't been a sequel since a long time. I played some topdown-racing games in the past, so I knew they were fun, too. Anyways, after watching the trailers, I was convinced this game should be fun to me. The camera looked really close, but since a screenshot showed the possibility to zoom further out, I bought the game anyways.First of all: this is not a racing game.It contains several levels where you have to be faster than others, but it feels more like a fast Arcade-Puzzle game. You cannot accelerate or brake, instead the focus is more on figuring out where to use which weapon.Every world in this game has 3 levels, of which 1 is a racing level. If I remember correctly, there were 5 worlds with a Racing-Level.The other levels are obstacle courses where you have to make use of your weapons, time trials or bossfights. While the bossfights look really good and are well designed, for me it was always about figuring out how to recharge your energy so you have enough power to beat the boss. Once you know the pattern and how to get energy, the bosses are not a big problem.The leveldesigns felt very intelligent and the overall experience was quite enjoyable, but it was really short and it took a while to get used to the controls. And the camera... the camera is REALLY weird in this game. Even if there are 3D-Elements, the camera makes everything look flat and 2D. It makes it even harder to control the machine without being able to slow down...Not to mention that the camera is still really, really close on the track - even with the 10%-upgrade. You hardly notice it at all.About the worlds and levels:You can choose which world to play in any order you like. Additionally to that, there are several locked bonus missions, that tell you to get all the weapons first. This is wrong: you have to beat all the worlds in order to unlock the bonus missions.I wanted to do the bonus missions before starting the last levels, but I couldn't find a way to unlock them. I wanted to grind XP to make the last levels easier, but without the bonus missions, it felt stupid to redo the previous levels again.Overall, I liked this game a lot, but I would've liked it more, if the focus would be more on the racing-part. I really miss some kind of Grand Prix-Mode, like in Mario Kart or F-Zero. Stil, it was fun and enjoyable to me.			",94,31,3,16,4,1,10

												Future racers, if you have played Wipeout, F-Zero, etc. You will all love this! You can take on any of the challenges in any order. It is challenging, but once you figure out the right way to beat a track you will eventually pull off a win, and it feels damn good to win in this. The electronic soundtrack is a very nice fit for the game and the controls feel smooth. You can spend XP in different attributes which adds an rpg element to the upgrade system in this game. The visuals are just right. Considering the fact this was made by just one person, i tip my hat off to you! This would make an epic arcade cabnet game.			",101,87,17,28,3,0,6

You play as Penelope on her quest to find Ulysses (her husband), making your way through the galaxy trying to avoid being captured or worse. Game progression is non-linear and up to the player as you can select any planet you like to explore but they are marked with advised difficulty settings. Each planet has a variety of race formats and some of these require much more strategy then pure race skills due to the game mechanics. Basically as you use weapons they drain energy and if you run out of energy it's game over, so it becomes somewhat of a balancing act between not crashing into walls and using power-ups efficiently. After completing events you will be rewarded with XP which can then be used for permanent upgrades.Anyone familiar with F-Zero/Micro Machines will feel right at home with this game. Responsive controls, great soundtrack and addictive gameplay (just one more turn!)Recommended and impressed given it's a one man team and early access. Cheers. :)			",4107,1606,205,507,690,51,637

												The Next Penelope is top down racing game that has RPG elements. The story has you playing Penelope, the wife of Ulysses who is on a mission to find her husband and save her people from all sorts of techno space versions of ancient gods. In the game you use the left and right buttons, or triggers, to steer your vehicle. As you play you unlock new powers by defeating bosses, and just like Megaman you’re free to explore and decide which powers you want to unlock first. The teleport power is great, it slows down time and lets you cheat your way around the levels. This boss fight with a minotaur has you warping around avoiding dangers while waiting for prime spots to attack. Each mission rewards you with experience that can level up some unique skills, like zooming out the screen to help you see farther. This game is amazing, fast, fun and the challenge ramps up perfectly. It’s like F-Zero and Megaman decided to play the speeder bike level in battletoads. ",835,207,20,100,87,8,125

												Want a MicroMachines inspired game for local multiplayer? This might be worth it. Looking for something that's enjoyable on your own? Look elsewhere. When TNP wants to be a MicroMachines remake, it's decent. The problem with the single player is that it doesn't want to be a MicroMachines remake for 2/3rds of the campaign. It's constantly forcing you into arenas and boss fights, and these simply do not work with a camera that intentionally obscures everything more than 10 feet in front of you and a handling system designed to feel like driving on ice. The bosses are essentially a competition to game the AI, with my most successful tactics largely consisting of driving in a big circle and dropping mines everywhere. That's not fun. The other problem with the single player, besides being short, is that the AI blatantly cheats to such an extent that, possibly even for people who are exceptionally good at this, all the races boil down to spamming the boost and teleport powers. You have to win every race to proceed, but the first place AI is often so far ahead that you have to lap the last place ship (which also starts ahead of you) in order to catch it. Besides that, the campaign is very short and awkwardly translated. I didn't finish it because the ""impossible"" level takes the safety walls off (remember that the controls are deliberately slidy) and then forces you to restart the longest track in the game every time you fall off. It's no doubt doable for the patient, but it isn't fun. In spite of all that, the local multiplayer is fun. It's probably a decent choice for a party game.			",325,88,10,64,30,1,57

												Disappointingly, sometimes unfathomably bad. It looks great in videos, but the feel just isn't there, along with numerous bugs and bad decisions that make it a frustration.It's far harder than it should be as a result of slow, inconvenient, and wildly unsatisfying controls combined with limited visibility (distance and effects), RNG, and attempt-ending bugs. The menu navigation is equally annoying with arbitrary delays and load screens. The entirely 2D playspace and abuse of screenshake make it unpleasent to look at from close distances, and the option to zoom out for more awareness is locked behind an EXP wall. The game's save structure means sets of levels must be completed in full, otherwise all of it is nullified and you keep none of the EXP you'd just earned/collected.When I beat the final boss I was relieved that it was over and felt like I'd just gotten done bashing my head into something; I'd have been happy with even ""mildly satisfied"" over this. If you manage to get through it, it's over so quickly; so little content to speak of. Every level is a one-off challenge, and then the few bonus levels at the end are frustrating and bland. It's not built around replayability; with not even a standard racing or time-trial mode like 98% of other racing titles have. The 4-player local co-op is like SpeedRunners, where you simply need to stay on screen to not explode, but the box that encloses comes in too soon with a hitbox that makes little sense.120hz support and the art are the only things going for it. Think about Absolute Drift, Little Racers Street, Toybox Turbos, Sonic Racing Transformed, or Wipeout HD if you want something similar conceptially but is actually mechanically satisfying.

												okay, almost completed this game in a good 2 to 3 hours. Only need the final boss, but hes hard as heck.Now actual review time:you a fan of futuristic racing games or Greek tragedies? Well, why not both?The story of this game takes a spin of the Odyssey by Homer, just this time as Penelope - Odyssuses wife who is ordered by Poseidon to find her Husband. In doing so she visits several ""islands"" (say:planets) of figures from the Odyssey.On each of the planets you have to complete 3 stages, with the first usually being playing around with your new weapon/gadget the second being an actual F-Zero style top down race and the 3rd being a Boss Fight.Controlling the game: the game has a simple control scheme and can be played with either a gamepad or the keyboard (pad is recommended, tho). you control your ship with <- and -> buttons, or the triggers on the pad to steer and the face buttons (Pad) or the up and down arrows as well as S,D,F and Shift for your Gadgets/Specials. I have to admit to my shame I havent played the game with a pad yet but with the keyboard layout I sometimes slipped and used the wrong power and wasted a good amount of energy.The control in a race is very responsive, but outside of it I had some troulbes. Sometimes the main menu woul only pop up after pressing the escape key a few times and the quit game option wouldnt respond too often either. but since those are less of a pain than a crippled steering I'll let it slipthe stages themselves are well made and each needs a different tactic (say: Gadget) to be effectively beaten. There are no energy refils on the Stage 2 track of the Sirens world, but you have Vampire Mines, that give some energy if something blows it up. Enemies (and on-stage obstacles) will use heat seeking missiles against you in the world where you get a Disarming crystal, that turns projectiles into XP-Pickups etc.The worlds can be visited Megaman Style, you pick one, blast through the 3 stages and you can use the gadget in every other stage after that.The FInale is a bit of a mix up, since its not a race but a side scrolling shooter which is hard as balls. Seriously. Thats what I,someone who grew up with the Touhou series says. The weapons take energy from your ships supply, which doubles as your health bar and when your juice runs out (yes you can overspend on weapons and manuver you into a dead end during boss battles) you, well, crash and have to start the current stage over. Same happens if you're not managing to fulfill the level goal.As someone whos not really into racing - I like it. Its a nice twist on an age old tale, it features the beautiful and wise queen of the Legend as a fierce futuristic shiprider and rolls up with some nice musics, too.Acievements may be broken. At least I didnt get any of the Boss 'Chievs. might have been a temp internet outage tho.Overall: recommended. good game, altho short			",956,241,9,154,75,7,118

That's enough for me to highly recommend it, but there's even more.An open galaxy with unlockable weapons to give you a good amount of freedom. Beautifully stylized graphics with retina-burning colors (retina-burning colors are a great thing — retinas are just an urban legend and we don't really need them). A weapon system that is actually smart and allows for some fast-thinking strategy. Plus it's fun. No really.  FUN! Just play it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I picked this up as part of a Humble Bundle and it was a fantastic surprise. The colours, music, and modern take on the Odysseus legend were all beautifully done. The weapons were great fun too (the harpoon is awesome!). In short, there is no game quite like this on Steam (though the pure racing levels do remind me somewhat of Super Laser Racer).Other reviews correctly note the short length of the main campaign (about 3 hours). However, completing the campaign unlocks additional levels, and a time trial mode. For some, these added features may still not quite justify the $13 price tag, but on sale it is an absolute steal.

												I really want to make comparisons to F-Zero, yet I cannot. I feel the perspective difference (top down) alone is enough to not, but there are clearly F-Zero influences in The Next Penelope. While many of them are obvious in game-mechanic behavior (energy charging strips and boosting), there is also new abilities introduced, with the most notable and fun, weapons. While the game-play isn't too original, this game implements them spot on for a very fluid and enjoyable experience.While I can't say it's a F-Zero successor (again, due to perspective differences), it most certainly seems to be for Micro Machines. Micro Machines was a great classic game from the NES I never really got into too much. However, The Next Penelope grasps my attention for a racing game immediately. With great art, music, and game-design, it's hard not to recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At 2 hours I have seen the final boss, and then quit out of a rare blend of bored frustration.Despite the game's description this is NOT a racing game. It has racing elements, most levels are on tracks, and some are actual races against NPC opponents, but most levels are about combat or survival focused. I personally wouldn't mind this dynamic if the combat wasn't so deeply flawed.The health mechanic in this game is one of the worst health implementations I've seen. Energy (their term for health) is used up whenever you take damage or whenever you use a weapon; this could provide an interesting balance of risk/reward, but health is doled out so rarely that you are constantly budgetting your weapon use. One small slip up in a match will leave you in a situation where you still have half of your health, but are forced to quit because it takes at least 2/3 of your health used as weapon energy to kill the boss you are fighting. About 1/3 of my playtime was retrying because I didn't have enough energy to beat a challenge/kill a boss, about another 1/3 of my playtime was just crashing into walls because the screen is so zoomed in that you can't see far enough in front of you to avoid damage. I discovered near the end of my playthrough that there is a RPG style leveling system that allows you to level up to zoom out the camera, but its an expensive upgrade for a feature that should be in my default.

												I'll be using the short analysis in my report here..It's a blend of SNES F-zero and micro machines and a little bit of arcade space shooter here and there, complete with racing, boss fights and other hardcore objectives to complete that'll really challenge yourself.   You unlock upgrades and weapons for your racer/ship by completing levels with gems you collect.   It's really got that SNES F-zero vibe to it when you turn and skid around and use your boosts and stuff. Nice one.   I want to play F-zero again on my old SNES console.  Do keep in mind, in the story, something happened to Penelope's racer which causes it to not use brakes anymore due to a techical error or some sort...so yea, fair warning, so i'd imagine the only way to stop her ship completely is to turn the engines off.I'd recommend using an xbox controller though.

								""The Next Penelope"" has a F-Zero vibe mixed with micromachines gameplay. The ship is always accelerating so you can focus on turning and using the weapons/skills. Using those weapons makes the racing way more complex and deep.There's a campaign mode with different missions and bosses, these stages have different goals (it's not always about racing), so there's a lot of variety. There are different difficulty levels, my first impression was that it would be a bit easy but there are some pretty hard and enjoyable challenges in ""The Next Penelope"".It's still on early access and has some minor issues, but even on its current state is a wonderful game. Can't wait to play this with my friends on multiplayer.			",272,106,3,42,18,5,32

Neonlights on please! A brilliantly executed old school racer combined with modern gameplay and a futuristic artstyle. Includes the beloved option to blow up your opponents.Reminds of F-Zero, Rock 'n Roll Racing, Megarace as well as Micro Machines, basically the 80's era. Controls are set in a classic manner, generally a cool thing but may take a short period of time to get comfortable with. The Next Penelope adds a sheer gigantic amount of dedication to an almost extinct genre. Respect towards Aurelien Regard who entirely created this title, some may know him for other projects like Hell Yeah or Poöf vs. The Cursed Kitty which he had been a part of.     Local co-op only, includes up to 4 players and is pretty much versus mode, still likeable though. Be aware there is no career mode. I can live with that given the overall amount of polishing Penelope recieved. 01.September - Penelope v1.07a: Runs on Win 8 and 10. I monitored FPS on a GTX680 and GTX750ti@1920x1080@60Hz. When initial loading prior to each track has finished no slowdowns occured.Thus everything is ok.Testrig: 4670K;16GB;Z87MB;SSD 840Pro256GB;650W PSU;driver rev v358,50 BONUS: Comes with huge bossfights!Great game, certainly I'd like to see a sequel to this.

												Really nice F-Zero inspired game. This game has a cool anime style mixed with the F-Zero SNES graphics. Of course this looks a lot better than a SNES game, but you can see its style is heavily inspired by the F-Zero series. Gameply is fast and furious, same old controls can be used from the old days as well. Tight controls, really fun to play IMO.

Though if you aren’t willing to replay a boss stage a dozen times in a row then you should keep in mind that unless you are a top-down racer/shoot ’em up vet, that’s going to happen. And I do have to add that the core game is rather short and won’t take you more than three or four hours, even with many restarts. But that just means you’ll be on to the next awesome indie game on your list, right?			",54,19,0,3,2,0,0

TL;DR: Very nice mix between micromachines and F-Zero, varied solo gameplay, lots of potential multiplayer fun! Too bad there is only local multiplayer for nowUPDATE 2017-02: Tested 3-player couch multiplayer with friends, THIS IS A TOTAL BLAST. Unless you have only ""close"" friends that dislike Micromachine like racing, this is a must-have to pile on that top 15 of ""couch fun gaming evening"" list.------Didn't quite finish the solo yet (some missions are hard ;)) but spent time enough (several hours, although many offline) to get a good opinion. This game is GOOD (but hard)! You could view it as a mix of several games. The solo campaign makes you follow a tragicomic story of Penelope trying to find her husband throughout the universe. On each planet you'll visit, you'll get access to a special equipemnet that you'll have to use to finish a specific challenge, a classic race against opponents or defeat a boss: laser, teleport, trip mines and such... The level design of each planet nicely revolves around the specific item, making it easy to understand. With that said, you'll still needs good skills and concentration to win!Didn't have a chance yet to fully test the multiplayer, it's more like a traditional Micromachines with equipment: choose a power then race to the point of being a screen away from your opponents. UPDATE: Tested multiplayer: even with only less than 10 different maps, the great design of each and the originality of each ""bonus tool"" makes it a great fun time with at least 2 other people!All in all:- Story: Nice. Although plot keeps basic in writing, dev put much effort in making the story funny and distracting, and the idea of reusing a classic mythological story in such a way gives it a nice refresher.- Graphics: as anything related to taste, you may or may not like it. In any case, every detail (character design, races, ships) follows a coherent design and gameplay-related objects (like energy) is easily identifiable.- Music: I'm not particularly fond of the genre, yet it is well adapted to the settings. Serves the gameplay well.- Gameplay: while I regret a bit that you cannot manage yourself the ship's speed (it's at constant speed), the variety of powerups and evident effort in designing original challenges makes up for it and far more.- Multi: local only (for now?), but probably as fun as Micromachines/Rock&RollRacing could be... Which is great! :)			",634,158,21,84,57,8,132

												Micro Machines meets F-Zero meets horizontal and vertical shmups in The Next Penelope, a short but intense and skill-based racer set in an interpretation of Homer’s Odyssey in the fantastical future. You are Penelope, wife of Odysseus and queen of Ithaca island. Your husband has been lost for years, vile suitors fight for your hand and Poseidon, lord of the vast ocean of space, desires revenge for the death of his son the cyclops at Odysseus’ hands. Take to the stars on a violent, high-speed crusade through a variety of challenging stages, earning new weapons for your forked vessel including a forward repeating energy cannon, vampiric mines, a harpoon, a ram-boost that knocks opposing hovercars aside, a short-range teleport and an energy crystal that coverts enemy projectiles into xp drops;  and experience points with which to purchase abilities, including the ability to dodge left and right, see a greater part of the screen, move faster, turn tighter, get an additional health segment, and the ability to zap enemy cars near you. Much like in F-Zero, use of the boost and other weapons drains your car’s energy, as do enemy attacks and collisions, but you can recover energy by driving over green, glowing orbs seen on the track. There is no minimap, and acceleration is automatic- you can only steer, so fast reactions are necessary for survival as it is difficult to anticipate incoming hazards. The story mode is split into several worlds, divided into three stages: the first stage is typically a tutorial that introduces one of the weapons, the second is a race against four opposing hovercars, and the third is a boss fight against such notable figures of Greek myth as the minotaur, sirens, arachne and charon.  Upon completion of the story mode a series of challenge levels are unlocked, such as time trials. The game’s presentation is very appealing, with a vivid color palette, appropriately fast-paced soundtrack, and even the option for artificial “scanlines” as in Iron Fisticle, for that authentic NES feel. The Next Penelope may not last you more then a few hours, but they will be memorable ones.			",332,6,5,16,2,1,15

TL;DR: Very nice mix between micromachines and F-Zero, varied solo gameplay, lots of potential multiplayer fun! Too bad there is only local multiplayer for nowUPDATE 2017-02: Tested 3-player couch multiplayer with friends, THIS IS A TOTAL BLAST. Unless you have only ""close"" friends that dislike Micromachine like racing, this is a must-have to pile on that top 15 of ""couch fun gaming evening"" list.------Didn't quite finish the solo yet (some missions are hard ;)) but spent time enough (several hours, although many offline) to get a good opinion. This game is GOOD (but hard)! You could view it as a mix of several games. The solo campaign makes you follow a tragicomic story of Penelope trying to find her husband throughout the universe. On each planet you'll visit, you'll get access to a special equipemnet that you'll have to use to finish a specific challenge, a classic race against opponents or defeat a boss: laser, teleport, trip mines and such... The level design of each planet nicely revolves around the specific item, making it easy to understand. With that said, you'll still needs good skills and concentration to win!Didn't have a chance yet to fully test the multiplayer, it's more like a traditional Micromachines with equipment: choose a power then race to the point of being a screen away from your opponents. UPDATE: Tested multiplayer: even with only less than 10 different maps, the great design of each and the originality of each ""bonus tool"" makes it a great fun time with at least 2 other people!All in all:- Story: Nice. Although plot keeps basic in writing, dev put much effort in making the story funny and distracting, and the idea of reusing a classic mythological story in such a way gives it a nice refresher.- Graphics: as anything related to taste, you may or may not like it. In any case, every detail (character design, races, ships) follows a coherent design and gameplay-related objects (like energy) is easily identifiable.- Music: I'm not particularly fond of the genre, yet it is well adapted to the settings. Serves the gameplay well.- Gameplay: while I regret a bit that you cannot manage yourself the ship's speed (it's at constant speed), the variety of powerups and evident effort in designing original challenges makes up for it and far more.- Multi: local only (for now?), but probably as fun as Micromachines/Rock&RollRacing could be... Which is great! :)			",634,158,21,84,57,8,132

												Seriously solid racing shooter.  It has the same reckless cornering feel as in wipeout as also gives the same rush.  There's  a few niggles but if I had to give it a number score it'd be an 8.5.  And is this the first time I've fought a boss in a racing game and it was actually fun and didn't feel tacked on? Yes.

												Lots of fun, unforgiving, high paced and an overall beautiful game. And its only getting better, being in early access. From every detail to detail in this game, it is well executed. From the open story style, to the creative and balanced weapons.It's a nice, fresh new look at scifi topdown racers. I would compare it to micro machines, in SPACE! But yeah, it's great.

								This game... Oh boy. I'm tempted to hate it, but yet it's so good! The Next Penelope is a top-down racing game that is essentially based on a future sci-fi Homer's Odyssey. Which is really cool, because it stands out in that respect! The art style is gorgeously bright, the sound and story are spot on, but I'm hesitant to give it a perfect review. I think that's more because A) it came out just a month ago and B) I suck at racing games than anything else. This game is ridiculously brutal, and yes, unfinished, but that is something which will change and I'll get better at it. The controls are good (using a keyboard), and it runs smooth! Definitely going to be playing this more, especially as it updates.So end result: 8/10. Crazy difficult, but crazy good, and completing sections are oh so good!Also, writing a Mythology paper on it, so we'll see how it goes ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The Next Penelope is a challenging hybrid of F-Zero, Mashed and Micro Machines with some uber boss battles thrown in for good measure. Penelope must master an arsenal of weapons and abilities such as mines, teleports and speed boosts to defeat her enemies in races, and destroy the massive bosses waiting at the end of each section.The game is tough but fair. If you fail, it's probably your own fault, and when you win it gives a great sense of achievement.  the single player here is enough for 3-5 hours of gameplay, with Hard mode and 4-Player local co-op to come soon. I enjoyed it a lot, depsite the difficulty!You can read my full review (and listen to a podcast about the game) here: http://goplaythat.com/2015/01/21/state-of-play-the-next-penelope/ ",275,136,5,55,18,3,28

								Bottom Line: 5 StarsPros: FUN, smooth controls (even with keyboard-only), excellent graphics, great soundtrack, very challenging, cool storylineCons: NoneHopes for the future: Make this game for tablet/phone/game consoles.  Description: The Next Penelope is a vehicle racing game set in the future where you control Penelope's Vehicle to overcome challenging obstacles and other racers.  The races remind me somewhat of Nintendo's F-Zero series, but with the camera from a birds-eye view instead of from the rear of the vehicle.  The storyline is creative, where it is a futuristic version of Homer's 'Odyssey', but this time... the lady is in charge.The game is HIGHLY addictive with tons of action and tons of suspense where I've even caught myself yelling at the other cars to slow down or explode.  The game is very creative where the vehicle runs on an energy bar, which is spent on weapon firing, boosters, landmines, and protection from crashes.  It is really awesome, because you can progressively supe-up your vehicle and make it stronger with newer and cooler upgrades.  The controls are smooth, even with only the keyboard, which makes me think it would be perfect for a touchscreen control system or a console system like the PS3, etc.  The graphics are very good for a 2D arcade racer but plays well even on computers with lower-end graphics cards.I highly recommend this game.  Very addicting and tons of fun.			",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ha ha ha ha, holy ♥♥♥♥ I can't believe people think this is a good game. I was getting into it, enjoying it a reasonable amount for a Construct 2 game (lol), and then I hit the boss battles.You have one bar that is simultaneously your health and attack energy. To damage the boss you have to sacrifice your health, and any damage you take reduces the amount of damage you can deal on that attempt.There's no energy restores in boss battles.What the ♥♥♥♥. What the actual ♥♥♥♥, did you guys even play these fights?Not to mention that the bosses deal damage every frame, so even a slight error in controls (which, I might add, make Borderlands cars look sleek) causes you to lose the attempt pretty much outright.♥♥♥♥ this game.EDIT: So it turns out I simply chose the wrong level order (100% the game's fault) and there's an item that lets you heal. I did the third and fourth bosses without the ability to heal, which you should have if you do the levels in difficulty order.Game is complete garbage, avoid at all costs.			",455,120,7,62,29,4,56

												I havent played enough of this game to give a solid review, however, i felt the need to write one from what i have seen so far.Put simply, I think this game would be better off as just a visual narrative adventure. The character artwork, dialog and general story setting (as an almost side view of the odyssey) are fantastic and make me want to see it to the end. But every time i get to a race im just utterly bored. In my opinion there is way too much ""flashyness"" going on, just lights everywhere and I can just faintly tell whats going on, or when im supposed to turn. Then, on top of the disorenting lights at high speeds the camera is zoomed in too close for comfort, which makes me feel like i have even less reaction time. Even more so the game has, in my opinion, a lack luster voice that speakes to you when you win or lose or start a match. I cant tell if its robot or human or alien and it seems so lazily done that I have to ask, why even? I mean, the levels I have played so far are so short that simply postive and negitive sounds would have sufficed. I would have even been fine with  victory /  failure reinforcing sounds be left at just the sound of the match start and when you get ""Wrecked"". Any how, these things to me would not necessarily be a deal breaker. The main issue that I have with this game is the steering. Now perhaps I just suck alot, but even after playing with both a gamepad and keyboard, I find the steering to be clunky and lazy. Its a mission on its own just to get my ship moving in a straight line while racing and I feel like that is a huge deal in a racing game. Sure I could just slam on the boost and sloppily bumper my way through levels, but that just doesent feel right. Polishing this more would have totally saved this game for me.TLDR; This game has some great asthetics, but the racing aspect seems to just be a means to an end to have active gameplay to an otherwise interesting narrative.

												Very nice 2D race game.I only played the solo: the challenge is not easy, but you always see what you need to improve to finish the race first.Recommanded to anyone who is nostalgic of Micro Machine video games			",91,12,3,4,5,1,20
