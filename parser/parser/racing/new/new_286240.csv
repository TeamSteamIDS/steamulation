Early Access Review
								------------------------------FIRST IMPRESSION------------------------------This game caught my eye and I decided to buy it on the first day despite no reviews being available. I will say that my first impression is positive. I did not notice any obvious bugs or flaws. The gameplay struck me as repetitive, but not boring. It has the potential to be addictive. The game proved to be a relaxing and enjoyable way to spend a night. It does not seem overpriced, but remember to be wary of any early-access title.------------------------------CORE GAMEPLAY------------------------------The core gameplay focuses on learning how to properly manage a team of dogs, and how to maximize race efficiency. Races use simple click and timing mechanics to manage factors such as sled position, hunger, jumping, and untangling. Proper racing is rewarded with speed and happy dogs. Awesome moments are rewarded with fame that can lead to sponsorship upgrades.Learning about each individual dog is important to team management. Each dog has a unique personality that will affect their natural sled position, likes, dislikes, happiness, and rapport with teammates. Dogs will have their own favorite things, skills, and faults. They will also have different levels of athleticism that will affect their fatigue and hunger.All of the information about races and dogs will serve one purpose: managing the team. The overall goal is to earn money from victories and move on to more advanced leagues. The time outside of races is used to rest dogs to lower fatigue, fill the journal, change leagues, and hire new dogs. Raleigh will offer a piece of advice (chosen by you) at the end of each race. This information will be used to fill the journal and provide gameplay tips. The first couple of leagues seem easy once the core gameplay is understood, but that seems subject to change based on in-game progress and future updates.------------------------------FINAL DECISION------------------------------I’m sure there’s plenty more to the game that I have not discovered yet, but these are my first impressions. I have no reason to dislike this game, and I would recommend it to anyone who finds the above information to be to their liking.			",91,16,4,7,8,3,16

 Sled Doggos Dog Sled Saga is a great game that although may be a tad unengaging at times, keeps you on your feet during some tricky stages later on in the game. Story: You are a rookie dog sled racer learning the basics, building your team, figuring out the individually special traits of your dogs, and once you hit the snow, the race is on. You develop a rival who you come to race time and time again througout the game, and the races do get close at the end. There is a tale told to you about how the dog sled racing scene came to be, but I'm convinced that it's not 100% accurate. There's not much to the story other than the fact that you are trying to enter higher leagues and become famous while beating your rival.  Races: You pick your lineup, which dogs go where (Wheel, Middle, Lead). Your dogs will have different capabilities on what breed they are and how you train them. Throughout the course, your dogs get exhausted, keep feeding them by lobbing food into the air at the perfect angle for them to snatch and gobble up. Don't worry if you run out, there are reload bags all along the tracks. There are some obstacles like trees that will block your throws and rocks that will require you and your dogs to leap over. Each race has different statistics such as: different team sizes, differing track lengths, amount of food reloads, amount of obstacles, and ground snow, wind, and weather quality. At the end of the races, the participating dogs may receive some popularity, experience, and stamina depending on how the race went, but for sure they will receive a certain amount of fatigue from the race. Feed your dogs to keep their energy up while avoiding obstacles, don't throw food at them when they don't want it or you'll bop 'em on their heads.  Resting: When you and your dogs aren't racing, you can let them rest, you can train them, and you can pet them! This is where you can let your dogs recover from fatigue, or where you can train them and boost their levels. Later in the game you have options to hire employees; caretakers or trainers who provide additional slots and capability of training some dogs while allowing others to rest during the regimen process that moves you a day closer to the next race.  Hire new dogs, say goodbye to old ones, do some training, pay your dues, get sponsorships, it's all part of your day to day life as dog sled racer.  Visuals: The pixel art convinced me to buy this game, the husky on the cover to be specific. The pixel dogs are adorable and the frame-by-frame animations are so smooth. There's so much detail put into the art and it all comes together and is executed perfectly.  TL;DR: A fun game that is a great buy, it may fall short to some in racing engagement and story, but it's addictive and outstanding in visuals and experience (roughly 5 hours gameplay time to reach the final league). I would recommend buying on a bigger sale (-30%+) even though I bought it at -10%. Absolutely worth it if you love dogs.			",227,49,7,22,28,2,31

												Since the game is now released and a lot more people are going to look at it, I'm going to write a review for it.Dog Sled Saga is, like the name already says a game about dog sledding and Team management. You start out with just a couple dogs as an unknown Team in a low league. From there you can train your dogs, manage your kennel, hire staff, hire other dogs, run races.How do the Races work?The Races are next to the management the most important Part of the game. They are what gives you your money that you need to do everything.The races play well, and are controlled over clicking, dragging and so on. Sometimes the races can get a little too much, especially in the highest league, but since you're on a high level and it already is quite forgiving with your mistakes, it just makes sense that sometimes you'd struggle.The game looks very beautiful, has lots of tiny and lovely detail in it, a small story and devs that care about their game. If you like Team management, Dog Sledding, Caretaking or small little games that don't ask you for much than you want than this is definitely worth it's price.If you're looking for a high indepth breeding simulator or something of that kind, you're wrong here.

												I have a dog on my team that sometimes goes into binge eating mode, and another that sometimes speed boosts with extra biscuits. So my races sometimes turn into a biscuit machine gun simulator! All the biscuits in the air all the time! Damn good thing my sponsor is a biscuit bag company.10/10 would make it rain biscuits again.For those wondering, this game is 1 part management sim, 1 part click-timing puzzles (during races), and 1 part building inexplicable bonds with pixel dogs. It has a little story to it also which is a bonus.Fun game, although a little repetitive at times. With how communicative the devs were throughout early access I'm certain we'll see good support.

Only recommend it to those who love dogs and micromanagement.Pretty much the whole game is a simple dog sled minigame with managing dogs, staff, and eventually breeding in between. Your winnings are spent on new dogs that can have different skills, aptitudes and so on coming in different breeds. You get to customize your sled and the dog harnesses/names. Pretty casual, but eventually gets a little challenging.			",253,60,4,39,13,3,29

								This game is like having football manager crossed with dogsThe gameplay is simple yet difficult to master as wind,trees and obstacles await u on the track weather plays a nice bit into the game as it feels like u are really in those weather conditions.Ur dogs need to be fed while racing so that their stamina dont go down too much that they cant run anymore(basically u throwing biscuits to them).If u time it right and throw it very close to their mouth then they will speed up even morethe dogs has different personalities. Their faults,their strong points and even their habits and even some dogs who love the attention of fans.Sponsors can sponsor u when u become famous enough tooso far i like how this game is progressing and hope that u guys can add more to itA few more options like upgrading ur house and ur own character walking around in the house and playing with the dogs or feeding with the dogs(basically more interaction with the dogs in the home to make a better bond with them and maybe even taking them out for a walk?) would be nice though...so far a solid game in my opinion			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is somewhat fun, but it doesn't have enough content to justify the price. Reading some other reviews, I'm lead to believe that it was originally intended to be an iPad game, which makes sense. Single button controls, cute and well made but simplistic graphics, and extremely limited gameplay. The races might have different snow conditions or numbers of obstacles, and the dogs different skins and traits, but the actual gameplay never changes and is ridiculously simplistic. The fact that this game costs (at the time of writing) nearly $9 is a bit preposterous. While I would happily pay $2 or $3 for this game, I would not recommend purchasing it at its current price. If you really want to look at the cute dogs, wait for the price to drop. Otherwise, don't bother.			",117,37,2,36,28,1,32

This probably is meant to add more challenge/strategy to the game, though.*Flashes that occur when dogs' skills are used can be distracting, leading to missed food.Easily worth the $5 I spent on it during a sale!

Mom-game of the yearPlaying this game makes me picture a mom relaxing on a couch on Christmas morning, curled up with her iPad and a mug of hot cocoa. If you are a mom and you like dogs, or if you just like dogs, this game is for you.The racing gameplay requires attention but not overly much skill or precision. Once you get the hang of it, you will finish every race in 1st place if you are a PC gamer of any experience. As implied by my reference to iPads, it's easy to tell that this game is designed for mobile, as every action is either left clicking, left dragging, or holding left click and releasing. No right clicking, no keyboard needed.Much of the enjoyment comes from strictly-unnecessary ""cute"" features such as petting the dogs, silly hero-shot close-up portraits of the dogs when they level up, cute sound effects, and the dog happiness system. If you have ever wanted to upgrade a dog's happiness from ""good"" to ""great"" by petting it, this is your chance. The automatic name generator won me over immediately when it named one of my first dogs ""Trashboat.""The dogs each have their own personalities and quirks, but whereas a normal game might revolve around discarding characters with bad traits and hiring new ones with good traits to maximize team effectiveness, here they serve as just more fun flavor, as they aren't make-or-break in any given race.tl;dr: Dog Petting Simulator 2016, 11/10 would pet again			",71,47,1,22,30,0,15

Early Access Review
								This is probably one of the most addictive games I have played recently. I first tried it at my friend's house and immediately had to buy it. I have been playing it like a maniac since then.So far I have enjoyed the game immensely, though that does not mean that I haven't noticed certain pros and cons to it.Thankfully the pros outweigh the cons. The game is a pixel game which in my case is awesome because I love pixel games. The dogs and everything is pretty detailed and with pretty darn good animations. The colors and nice and soft and don't hurt the eyes even though the majority of the game consists of various shades of white and gray (the environment).The game's racing mechanic is simple enough yet it offers a challenge, especially later in the game when you reach higher leagues. For examples, I am currently part of league 6 which involves having up to 5 dogs on your team and I have to admit I am struggling a bit more often to reach the 1st place. It takes a bit of practice and choosing the right dogs for the race becomes a lot more important. Still, it is very fun and enjoyable. Managing your team is probably my favorite part of the game. Considering all the expanses you have it is really important to keep only those dogs who work for you. However, you usually have to spend some time working with any dog to see if it's really a good match for your team. There are quite a few things to considering when creating a team for a particular race. I also love that you can now specifically train or rest your dogs and manage who will train, and who will be idle for a while. Having staff to help you with that is of great help, especially if you have a lot of dogs to work with. Unfortunately there are a few things that do bother me, though I am pretty sure they will be improved later.First of all, yes, I understand that higher leagues are meant to offer a much greater challenge when racing, but sometimes the obstacles you have to face are a bit too much. Sometimes it is a bit too difficult to get to a race that your dogs are ready for and that will give you enough money to pay your bills. Although the game has quite a few of them, I would love to see more dog breeds, but the ones who are actually suitable for dog sledding. Though I am sure that will come with time. Also, I wish there were more things to do in the game. At the moment you pretty much just race and spam the rest/train + proceed buttons. I wish we could interact with our dogs more by feeding, playing or petting, maybe make it optional to boost their happiness, or skills or something. Maybe add some real errands where you have to transport things, or help people in need, like a simple quest system that can help you financially or in some other way like free special training or something. Crafting would be a nice addition, maybe make your own food or equipment or something like that. They do plan to add breeding later to the game which will be awesome. All in all, this is a great little game to play at almost any time and I cannot recommend it enough! :D Regardless of whether you are a dog lover or not, it is a good game to play. The only real issue is that once you start playing it is definitely difficult to stop. On more than one occasion I would start playing and after a couple of minutes realize that in fact almost 2h had passed.

												For such a simple minigame type of gameplay, it has a ton of things to do, lots of character and passion. Even with no real knowledge of the actual Iditarod this game is fun, fast paced, and very easy to get into but still has all the challenege one needs to curse at the screen wildly! You can even make puppies and groom them to be the best racing dog, all the while continuing to climb the League Ladder so you can get even more of the cold (very cold) hard cash. Only negative I could say is it is definitely repetitive, you will be doing the same thing for a long time. I haven't gotten to an ending just yet, but hopefully there is a period on this game, though I am not against it if it goes on forever Rouge-like style. All in All, Definitely a good buy!

This is a 4 dollar game, not an 8 dollar game.The developer is selling it for twice as much here as on iOS or Android.So there must be extra content on the PC version, right? Nope.So let's look at the content of the game.Look at the playtimes of the people who bought this. 5 hours. 8 hours.There's no endgame content, folks. No satisfying payoff to the ""story.""Gameplay is lacking any depth. Feels like a mobile game ported to PC.Present glitches in final build allow duplication of dogs.Achievements are broken and have to be done twice to be earned.And really, just look up at the video of the gameplay up on the top of the page. No, seriously, look up at it for a sec, then ask yourself something--Looks cute, right? Looks like fun? But doesn't it look like something better suited for a phone game?  For half the price?

								Dog Sled Saga originally caught my eye because I'm an animal lover and I enjoy a good pixel game. I was looking for a more casual game I could play when I didn't feel like tackling a steep learning curve or intense multiplayer gameplay. Dog Sled Saga met all of those expectations and more. Personally, I find Dog Sled Saga to be one of those games that I might play when I'm feeling down or overwhelmed. The atmosphere, though its graphics are simple, is fun and upbeat. The game may not reap so much satisfaction for everyone, but I feel so triumphant and proud of those adorable, digital dogs when we win a particularly difficult race.I'm typically wary of Early Access games, but I've gotten more than my money's worth out of this game, and I'm not even close to getting bored. I'm happy to support the developers with whatever they choose to bring to Dog Sled Saga in the future.			",48,8,2,10,11,0,1

												Dog Sled Saga ReviewThe game shines the most at the gameplay and the managing-aspect of the sled-dog team. The races are a lot of fun and never started to get stale or feeling like chores. I was always looking forward to them especially when I made (or thought I made) improvements to the team. Every available Dog, while randomly generated is very unique, with its own skills, flaws, favorite things and talents that are reviled over time while working with them, witch to me totally sells the idea of being a musher. I even go so far as to say, if my team would have been swapped to another one late game, even with higher level dogs, I wouldn’t have known what to do with them, since knowing your dogs and there quirks is so important. The quality is very high, every little detail seems thought through and balanced. If I had to criticize something it would be that a few more music pieces wouldn’t have hurt and maybe that the extra stuff members weren’t needed that much, but I still love everything else about it. It delivers the experience that the game is about and that is something much more games should focus on.  ",13,9,2,7,10,0,2

												A simple-but-not-boring-cookie-launcher-simulator game with fluffy cute puppys. The main structure of the game is good enough, but it still seems a bit unfinished, which is understandable. There's just so much element can be added in, such as new breeds that can only get from breeding, better cookies(?), more daily activities, etc. pros:   dogs-the graphic is 120/100  addictive-got this game 2 days ago and now I have 15 hrs gameplay  simple-easy to play but still interesting.  music-decent  story-nice, if finished  dogs-I mean, those dogs are really cute...cons:   simple-I believe it will get even much better in the future  bugs-I've seen several by now. Hope they fix them soon and I don't need to replay again from the beginning...  not much else for a game that is still in early access...It really has great potential. It absolutely worths a try if you like dogs or pixel-style games!			",6,11,1,3,5,0,2

								I reccomend this game to anyone who has a love for sled dogs!!! The gameplay is casual. I have found that the game progresses nicely. You pretty much set the pace of the game. It's entirely up to you whether or not you should enter the next league. I love how the stats of the dog affect the outcome of the race, like where the dog is best positioned for example. The actual races are fun too! It's all about timing dog treats while looking out for any knots in the ropes or obstacles in your path. The graphics are cute and the music is kinda fun! And the price is nice too! So far I have not found anything that I dislike! It's a fantastic, small, inexpensive, causual, and cute game!!!			",9,0,1,2,1,0,0

												I played the game for about two hours. I am really excited about these new old games. I like the atmospere. Cabin in the woods. Snowy outside. Taking care of the dogs. Really nice. Although I like playing the game, I got a feeling the game isn't quite finished. Although the gameplay during the race is really nice and smooth, I think the storyline is somewhat thin. You get updates about some old sledrider when you're back in the cabin which isn't really connected to anything in the game (at least till league 5). And then there is the fast sled rider with the turbo-husky's, which the main character keeps complaining about. The thing is when you doing alright, the fast sled rider never wins and you still are annoyed about him which seems a bit strange. At last there is some balance missing in the upgrade system. For example the most expensive trainers seem not really necessary, because the dogs are easily maintained in top condition with just the main character (at least till league 5). Did I enjoy the 2 hours I played? Yes. Will I play it again tomorrow? Yes. Am I looking forward to it? Yes.			",34,8,1,4,4,0,3

								This is a fun, simple but challenging game that reminded me of Oregan Trail within the first minute. I really thought for a moment that my dogs were going to die if I clicked the wrong thing. Lol. Luckily that wasn't the case and what this game has going for it instead is a basic structure that pulls you in and has you constantly trying to better yourself. You might even wind up yelling at your dogs. I spent twenty minutes wanting to bury my Schnauzer in the dirt because the idiot kept getting fatiqued far too quickly, my other dogs didn't like him, and he made me lose out on TWO consecutive races even though he was REALLY good as the wheel dog!!! I highly recommend this game for any dog and snow lover. It's charming, fun, and with it's own challenges that are well worth the effort in my opinion. I even stuck the movie Snow Dogs to play on the side while I tried to build a reputable team. Can't wait to see more of this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I tryd to make her happy, but I could't because she WOULD'T GO ANYWERE (except for training, wich made her EVEN MORE DEPRESS). I looked at youtube to see how to make my dogs happy. But I failed... It just was a wast of time trying to make my dog happy... I failed... Please... Forgive me Suki (my dogs name)... I failed to make her happy so I clicked the unistall... Im so sorry.

												I stumbled over Dog Sled Saga because I was looking for a management game. Despite the fact that in Dog Sled Saga you don't have tons of infrastructure you can build and improve, as a game itself it is pretty entertaining. The goal itself is fairly straight forward: You are to build a winning dog racing team, make your way through the leagues, beat your rival, The Jerk, and learn a bit about a background story. It's a lot about micro-managing the dogs and your employees, with some dexterity needed for higher leagues. Despite the simple premise, it's tons of fun for the casual management nerd and doglover - for a small adventure inbetween or to fill some dull evenings, this small management gem is definitely worth a look.

								I have been following this game off and on since it has been announced.   It is not yet finished but has already met my expectations in a sled dog game.  The graphics are retro flavored, caught between 8 and 16 bit style.  The dogs have so much personality in their faces (as well as their stats).  The game is fun to play, and while I would like to have more breeds to select from, and a deeper management of their stats, it is still a great game to spend a few hours on.  Cheering on your favorites, cursing when their faults kick in at the wrong time, and laughing because your favorite dog's favorite thing is.... snow.  Fun, adorable, easy to play.  Just don't expect a deep story or complex career mode.... not yet anyway.... they are still working on it, and I look forward to see what they add.... but the bottom line is this:Even in the state the game is in NOW, it is a FUN and UNIQUE game experience.  DEFINITELY worth the very reasonable asking price.			",270,71,2,48,35,1,24

Would like to see more uses for the cash like sled upgrades or gear and maybe they are allready working on that.

								I saw this game while browsing through the Linux games. It looked pretty fun in the videos, so I figured I'd give it shot. I'm glad I did. It's a really fun and simple game, where all you do buy some dogs and race, I guess with the goal of advancing through the ranks. Your dogs all have certain talents, likes, faults, ect., so you'll have to decide which position on the team the dog gets in order to maximize it's abillities.  Everything is done with the mouse, making the game easy to control, and because of the simple gameplay, It's real easy to jump in and out of. The graphics are really good and the sound and music great as well. Even though this game is in early access, it feels pretty complete already. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes retro style games, dogs, or to those who don't have a lot of time to game. Two thumbs up!			",30,8,1,4,19,0,28

												I wanted to buy this game because I saw StacyPlays (another underrated YouTuber,) play it. So I got it and started up a save file. The dogs I chose were Neko the samoyed (Now Stacy,) Balto the saint benard, and Keiko the malamute. And these were all randomized names! I seen other reviews that were wondering why they put toy breeds in, but I don't know why either. Since it is a steam review and they're expecting me to list pros and cons, I'll just put them here.Pros:-DOGS!-Good game to waste the time.-I like the pixel art style. The visuals appeal to me.-You can have puppies! They're cuter than heck, and the name for the program is ""Build a Puppy.""-The name of the mountain though. Mountain Saint Something. I can imagne the developers saying: ""We need to name a mountain! Quick, Bob! What should it be called??"" *Bob is working on saint benards* ""SAINT SOMETHING!""-I like the story behind it. Cons:-League six.-There are no yorkshire terriers! Games are never complete without yorkies!(regret the last thing I said and only think about league six as my only con)I really enjoyed the 37 hours of gameplay into it!			",0,3,1,0,2,0,0

								My Let's Play of Dog Sled Saga:


YouTube™ Video: Phawx Plays Dog Sled Saga - Even Pixel Dogs Are Charming - Let's Play 

			Views: 215		



My Review:Mechanically speaking, there are only a handful of actions that are required of you whilst you are Dog-Sleding.  You click and hold the mouse button to initiate a variable trajectory with which you try and hurl dog biscuits into your awesome dog's mouth.  You'll know your dogs are hungry by their panting breath against the cold pixel-y wind.It is actually quite easy to blunder this up.  First if you try and feed your dogs before they are hungry, it will comically bounce off their noggin and you'll have lost a doggy biscuit.  Second if you just clearly miss (some dogs seem to be better catchers than others) well then you're probably going to lose the race.  But sometimes you can miss because you aren't paying attention to the huge TREE INCOMING sign.So what happens if your dogs are hungry?  Well, aside from going slow they trip up the works.  You'll have to, in real-time, adjust the length of rope dividing the dogs to make sure it has proper length to avoid getting tangled.  Outside of that, I'm not really sure.  I never went that far without feed my dogs.Dog Sled Saga is surprisingly deep despite being pretty shallow.  All of the game can be controlled via the mouse and one mouse button.  You don't really need to tend to your dogs outside of the races, like a tamagotchi.  The only thing you need to concern yourself with is if they are tired and if they get along with other dogs on your team and what type of position they like to be in.Despite all of this, I did find myself becoming attached to my Dog Sled Saga team.  The pixel art is wonderful to watch and the music, my goodness the music.  It is great!  I mean, the music is 8-bit style, but it's SO WELL DONE.  Truly gets stuck in my head.I am a fan of Dog Sled Saga even though right now it seems kind of bare-bones.			",2854,1053,111,309,337,23,419

								Extremely fun! I love my dogs, and have unlocked every single hint available. I have around 11 dogs now, but the ones I use are;Lead: Ranier (Malamute) or Owl (Normal Husky) | Middle: Bear (Yellow Lab), Comet (Chocolate Lab) , and Blizzard (Brown Husky) | Wheel: Mako (Saint Bernard) and Horizon (White Husky)Extremely fun game- was worth the money for me. My lead dog Ranier has an awesome skill that makes the whole team faster! All of my dogs are fantastic and their skills are pretty nice.(If you are a dog person like me, I would reccomend.)

								It's fun, but there are a few unacceptable issues. There is no volume control on the music or sound effects - so you can either have them turned ON (and very loud), or OFF. There is no explanation as to what some of the more obscure options are (""Catch Cursor""? ""Sharp scale""?). These should be explained simply so players know whether to turn them off or on.Also, the other thing that really bothers me about this game are the dog breeds that you can choose from. Husky and Malamute are fine, but Labradors? St. Bernards? Schnauzers? Worst of all, Shih-Poos? Seriously? These breeds are NOT sled dogs by any stretch of the imagination, and they kind of break my immersion in enjoying the game when I see them on the ""Hire Dog"" list. The game presents itself as otherwise somewhat ""realistic"" otherwise - I can't hire unicorns for my team, and I can't put rockets on my sled for speed boosts, plus there are weather and track conditions that affect my run - so having completely unrealistic dog breeds on my sled team really ruins it for me. I wish there was an option to only hire sled-appropriate breeds (and there are plenty actual dog breeds to choose from that are acceptable as sled dogs). So this game needs a few serious tweaks - some improvements to the Options menu, some more dog breeds to choose from (and the removal of the ridiculous breeds or the option to filter them out in the Hire Dog menu), and possibly some other things to do besides run races. Some simple minigames to play with your dogs inbetween races would be fantastic.Otherwise, the game is enjoyable, and cute - a good way to spend some time, but it becomes repetitive quickly when all you can do is run races.

												A very solid experience over all! This is a treat if you're a dog-lover. The gameplay is primarily reaction-based commands that get more and more frantic and challenging as you progress through the ranks along with some light team management. It's pretty darn unique, and the artstyle is cute and charming.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unfortunately, I've not seen the dev post anything since launch and there is a major bug that causes saved games to disappear. It stinks to sink time into this game to be for naught. Will change the review when dev fixes.----------------------------------------------------------------For a two person dev team this game is pretty good. It's a lot deeper than I initially expected. It's got that ""one more turn"" feel to it for me but I do hope they continue to support the game in the near future with updates or a dlc. It's a pretty straight forward game with some trial and error. There are plenty of videos online that explain the mechanics and features for you to check out. I think what would give this title a little more staying power is if they developed the leagues piece a little more. I'd like to be able to track the history of my team performance vs. other sledding teams. Another great addition would be if the dogs aged and you had to retire them. You could keep them around for breeding until they die of natural causes, sell them for profit, or give them away to a loving family...all of these choices could give your dogs in the kennel certain perks or affect morale in some way.I could even see multiplayer being pretty fun with this game. But that would probably take more dev team members to be able to do.At any rate, it's been a fun little game that is easy to play in short bursts. Definitely worth seven bucks in my opinion.

								Simple but very fun. I bought this as I am a huge dog lover and there seems to be a lack of dog games they don't have you dress up a dog in stupid outfits.The Graphics are simple and pixelated but it makes up for that in it's gameplay. I find myself cheering my team on near the end of a race.Pros. Dogs. Personalties. Dogs have stregth and weaknesses. The higher leagues are actually challenging. Easy to pick up and play. Dog sledding, need I say more? Have your own Iditarod.Cons. Gets bit samey after a bit. All care and training is automatic, no hands on interaction . No customiation, it would be nice to edit your sled, dogs harnesses etcOverall I do reccomend this game to those who like casual laidback games, it's actually quite fun to try and get get through all the leagues.

												So far, I have played Dog Sled Saga for about 4 hours, just got into league 3, have a 4 dog team (am still training the newbie) and I am looking forward to the future!All in all, this is one of those games that is more than the sum of it’s parts.  At first glance it appears to be just another simple management game, however there are so many little details that really make this one something special! Everything feels like an accomplishment, and skilled game play is rewarded with more money, and happier, less fatigued dogs.  There is a bit of a learning curve as you get use to the timing of the races, but it isn’t to bad, and even in the beginning when you don't really know what is going on, it is possible to make ends meet.I found all aspects of the game to be well balanced from the start, and as my own skill and knowledge improved the game play did not become to easy or monotonous.  You control the pace of the game with how many dogs you own, and what league you are in.Now, I am trying to save up enough money to expand my kennels, so I can try my hand at breading!I feel like the fun is just beginning, and I can't wait to see what else this game has in store!

								Could you make another update?Where you can tell the 4 dogs that you would like and when you get the money you can get the fourth dog?So the 1st dog is there, then after you get it the 2nd, 3rd and well, the 4th.But they can choose if they still want what they chose, if they click the X then it will ask if you want to have another decision or you wanna do it the old fashioned way.For example you ask this:                                                                               1st DogName: KishoGender: FemaleBreed: White HuskyColour (for harness): Green (not a very light green)                                                                               2nd DogName: BluGender: FemaleBreed: White HuskyColour (for harness): Blue (not any light blue)                                                                               3rd DogName: EverestGender: MaleBreed: White HuskyColour (for harness): Dark Grey (the dark grey on their back)                                                                               4th DogName: BanditGender: MaleBreed: White HuskyColour (for harness): Black (not a dark grey)________________________________________________________________This would be helpful for the people who might join the game and were hoping for this type of dog but ended up having to get another dog because they didn't show up at all.I wrote what I would choose if you updated it to be like that.

												Didn't think much of this game before I read the reviews, and I can honestly say it is well worth the price. Super fun and cute RPG game with a good bit of depth to it.			",62,8,1,5,13,1,8

								A good game, perfect for a dog sledding fan like myself from a country where the sport does not exist. While it's a simple game by design, it's challenging and deep enough to be rewarding. Definitely recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I myself love this game! There are many races, dogs, and other fun little surprises along the way. But I think that you should be able to feed, groom, and play with your dogs. The only thing you can do with them is race. Other than that, I think this game and its graphics are awesome though.			",1,1,1,0,0,0,0

												An update broke the game. It runs, but won't respnd. Lots of comments in the forum about this. Devloper doesn't seem insterested in addressing them beyond the tired old update-your-graphics-drivers idiocy. This is a pixel-graphics game. I am running a high-end Alienware gaming laptop that is fully up-to-date. We should not be having these problems.			",204,103,23,97,68,0,91

								Super fun an addictive game, gets harder as you progress. Surprisingly complex in team management, you have to figure out who works well with who, and what conditions your dogs prefer. Totally worth every penny. I look forward to seeing how the developers continue to improve this amazing game.			",29,20,2,6,5,0,0

								It's a fun, cute game that I really enjoyed playing. I can't wait for more to be added to the game; it didn't take me very long to pass through the seven leagues the first time but now I've restarted multiple times with different teams. It was definitely worth the eight dollars.			",18,4,1,0,3,0,0

Early Access Review
								This is a very fun game with a unique style of gameplay and an original theme.  It is different from other racing games. There is no 'upgrading', rather over time you get to know the traits of your dogs and decide how to use them in the best way to keep them happy, running fast and winning races. It is a different kind of challenge, yet at the same time not overwhelmingly complicated.it's a game that feels complete for something still in early access.  ",154,20,1,32,10,0,1

								I backed this on Kickstarter and have enjoyed it since they released it on Steam Early Access. A fun game with limited controls. Can't wait to see what else the developers do.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
