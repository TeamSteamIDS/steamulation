												Rage Runner takes the ever addictive ""one more try"" genre of obstacle dodging games made popular by previous titles such as Race the Sun, Avoid, or T.E.C 3001 and gives it more direction by ditching the abstract themes in favor of a more concrete sci-fi setting. In a way, the trench-running pillar-dodging style here is extremely reminiscent of the Death Star section of the '83 Atari Star Wars arcade game, one of the best arcade games of all time.You'll find all the usual factors of a great dodge'emup here including very simple and easy to get into gameplay and controls that are exceedingly hard to master, and meticulously designed levels that are meant to push you to the edge and keep you retrying on that one seemingly impossible bit. What's different here are a number of advanced moves you can use to alter your ship in a number of ways such as rolling sideways to make it through tight fits or slowing down to let traps move out of your way. These add way deeper mechanics than seen in any other game like this, and need to be mastered in order to perfect levels. Merely running through the later levels will not be an easy task, as you'll have to employ every one of these maneuvers in order to make it without crashing. Even moreso if you want a comfortable spot on the leaderboards.This is very well-made, looks and sounds great (seriously, the music is really cool) and includes all of the bells and whistles you would want for a Steam release including achievements, leaderboards, trading cards, and the very active developers are even considering Workshop support with a level editor which would add even more depth and replayability to this already fun as hell title.At $5, this is pretty much a must for any arcade gaming fan's library.

												On the surface, Rage Runner puts you in a fixed wing jet and forces you down a corridor in a race against the clock.The main game has two modes, endless and practice, which feels more like the real meat of the game. When you look deeper, you'll find an arcade mode that has its own main game that happens to be a 2.5D side scrolling shooter mixed with a mouse cursor shooting game. Inside the arcade mode is two mini games, one is Rage Runner's own version of Super Mario Brother's first level and the other is a game where you juggle a key. This circus has a lot going under the big top.As for the main game, it can best be described as Star Fox inside a hallway. You'll have to navigate the long corridors, dodging walls, smashers, low ceilings and high floors. Your winged future jet is wide, but tall, so to make it past a lot of walls you'll need to turn with the simple touch of a button that immoderately shifts you. The vessel has a boost of speed that lets you charge forward and an air brake that will halt your movement no matter how fast. It holds you there and lets you fly again after a moment, so there's no need to hold the brake. Then, to blast your way through doors, you come equipped with a forward cannon that only fires if you have enough ammunition collected from giant blue spheres.To get additional time and even earn the right to boost, you'll need to touch smaller blue orbs that can be found almost everywhere. Imagine them as a guide giving you incentive to shift your jet up or down as a warning about the walls coming your way.If you scrape yourself on a wall, ceiling or floor there's no problem. You only stop when you slam into a wall. One wreck and you'll have to retry from the start. It makes for a fast paced one more try attitude, but the game should hasten your respawn rather than showing your crash and forcing you to chose to retry or exit. I will admit this type of game makes me want to exit more than keep playing.When you finish one practice level, a new one unlocks. There are thirteen in all and there is even a level editor and Steam Workshop support to find new levels. The endless mode lets you select your difficulty and play a random game or designate a seed. The endless mode is completely different and has you flying between two sets of tubes while space rocks and debris obscure your path. There are no blue spheres or orbs to pick up, instead you start with a few shots in your cannon to make asteroids disappear. For each checkpoint you reach, you get a refill. It feels much easier than the practice levels.One thing to note is how the endless scoreboard pops in every few seconds, obscuring your screen with a flat blue box to tell you rank 950, rank 900, rank 850 and so on. It can be amusing in a way, because the box is stapled to a point near your ship and not to your camera view from far away, to near has only the corner of the notification. Of course then your ship is too big and obscures your view, but there is also a bumper angle view.There are budget games and then there are cheap games. Rage Runner feels cheap visually. The visuals during the game are serviceable with a lot of the same used textures and that's forgivable, but what's awful are the menus. Bold single color menus with no style other than the most basic shapes with text.The menus are inconsistent. The game allows for 360 controller support or keyboard and mouse support and it makes use of the controller support on some menus. Other menus, you're forced to use a keyboard, while others you need a mouse to click buttons. The inconsistency is so bizarre. To make things more interesting, the arcade game has its own separate menu and loading screen.Its as if they are two completely different games have been stitched together as one. The arcade mode even has its own settings that look completely different from the main game's. This is one of the biggest anomalies that I've seen when digging through indie games. The arcade's menus look like they had work and effort put into them. Another odd thing is how selecting the arcade game from the main menu forces you to select ""arc"" from a different list of games that has only one game. It could streamline things to just take people to the arcade game. It even has its own style of loading screen.Once its loaded, you need to use only a mouse to select ""Play game,"" so that's three things you need to click on, but it goes one step further, because you need to press start on a 360 controller making that the fourth step. There is no key or mouse button to progress this except for the 360 controller.This tacked on arcade game forces you to enter your name and that's fine, but the main game knows your name. You can play the arcade game with four players and there is a trap, because if you chose character select it takes you to name your character. Its a trap because there's no way to confirm your name even with two ""done"" buttons. Clicking them, hitting enter, space, escape and using the controller all fail. This is the same screen to name your character in the first place so it does work, but it works elsewhere.Now that I've covered all of the surface level issues, its time to dig into the real ""ARC"" game itself. Story mode has you in a gun turret shooting down boxes using a cursor on the screen. Playing this with a controller could be better, such as a dash button for the cursor. Cubes appear, shoot projectiles and then your turret runs out of ammunition laughably quick. You then need to teleport yourself to a pod and run as a person to the ammunition box, grab it and run back to the teleporter where you can take over the turret again. As a person, one hit will kill you and make sure to use your few shots of turret ammunition wisely, because after two boxes, no more will spawn in. In fact its a lot easier to just shoot down the enemies using your character. His laser has no ammunition. Completing a wave starts a new one.The first mini game is a Mario clone with guns. In this single level, you'll find pipes, spiked rolling enemies and support beams that block your vision. There are bricks to shoot and question blocks to earn credits by shooting. You can jump and shoot in almost any angle, but its missing one key ingredient to any Mario game and that's the ability to run. Without having a run button, it makes any pit a difficult death trap. One of the gaps you need to just about hover over the edge to make it.The juggle mini game makes you juggle a key by shooting it. Your lasers bounce off the walls and floors so its possible to shoot yourself if there's no way to dodge your projectiles. Its dull, but hey at least its here.Well if you have a Youtube channel that wants to make fun of games, oh I highly recommend it. For anyone else, avoid Rage Runner. Even the main game feels like it should be on a mobile device and just lacks any polish to make it more engaging. I hope that the developers can learn from this and at least learn consistency with menus as well as sticking to one idea.			",1121,324,51,104,96,15,167

												Rage runner pilot a ship, go through an obstacle filled corridor, try not to crash into everything you see, but while trying to dodge, keep in mind that you have a timer. This game throws everything it's got at you, and it won't give you time to breathe. Graphics - It's not that hard on the eyes, true it could look better. If you really look at the objects you can see the pixels, but at the speed you will be going, it's hard to really look at them.  8/10Music - There a few songs you can choose before you start your level, half of them are slow and the others are fast, choose the ones that appeal to your play style. Also on another note, there is a sound when you start your level, which can't be turned down from the game or your computer, don't know if it is just for me, but it is worth saying. 9/10Cinematics and Story - NoneContent - A fair amount of levels, cards and achievments, even a bonus game inside the game, that was an unexpected but pretty cool suprise. 7/10Controls - Responsive, but of course it is an arcade and racing game, so it is better on an controler, still good on a keyboard. 9/10Gameplay - Pretty fun. For a racing game, it really does give you the sense of speed, which I know a lot of racing game do, but it was still worth saying that this one does too. 8/10Rage runner a game I bought when it was on sale for like 0,40 or something like that, left me suprised by the amount the game has to offer. Ohh and also under tags where it says Casual, believe me when I tell you, it is not for casuals. It is way too challenging or I am just bad (the second). Either way, have fun. Final score: 8.2/10			",143,38,8,29,12,2,24

												To put it bluntly: There's little reason to play this game for more than a few minutes to get the full experience. You are a space craft in a constant forward run attempting to avoid objects. Any crash and you restart. The game has two modes: ""Endless"" and ""Practice."" Oddly, Practice is the actual game, or at least what you can consider a game as it has multiple levels and some manner of objective to the courses. Endless is as it sounds, a simple straight track that goes for as long as you can stay alive. In either respect, it becomes quite repetative very quickly. Endless is filled with asteroids and debris along a straight corridor, and Practice is a series of runs through various obstacle courses. The only appeals for this, for me, were the possibilities of variation, something that would make each play through feel like a genuine challenge. Instead, it comes off flat and rather monotonous. The music is fine enough, and the controls are good enough to fly with, but overall the polish of the game is lacking. There also seems to be no further support on this game since it's release, meaning that while there is a large screen in the Game Select Menu for multiple other modes, nothing has been added to it to bring anyone back. Long and Short, even on sale, save your money on Rage Runner.			",675,106,22,64,35,2,72

												Just got this game while watching m1cr0star streaming it. He actually gifted it to me but even if he did not I would have grabbed this gem for 5 bucks.So far there are nine levels all of which have leaderboards. It's extremely fast paced and it just feels so cool screaming through corridors and dodging stuff.I also want to tell you that the devs (two of them made this game) seem really cool. They had both joined the stream and answered questions from everyone. They also said they will work to add a level editor to the game so that we can all build our own levels thus increasing the games life. Don't look at my short time played as an indicator of the game. As it stood I had to leave so I just fired it up for a quick spin. Needless to say it's addicting and I'll be playing more.Buy this game! For 5 bucks you can't lose.			",354,75,2,56,25,4,57

												Not sure how to rate this game. It is a pure and simple game of trying to survive as long as possible and setting a High Score (Best Time). At least the main part of the game with the Level of the Day playing a game of ""reach the checkpoints"". There are also Levels, which can considered to be more of the ""challenge"" portion of the game like an obsticle course. Last, there is Arc, a game within a game which was apparently an OUYA game that got ported over. This does allow for upto 4 players to play a little action shooter, but it really is just a little action shooter, great for quickplay, but not for long-term. Choose wisely on this game, because this is not a ""wow, how awesome!"" kind of game.			",140,11,11,7,4,1,9

												Best Flappy Bird clone I played ever in my life. 10/10In all seriousness though, its a great game. :P Level design makes the levels very challenging and even if you complete the levels you have others to compete with for score on the Online Leaderboards. Is it an original game? No. Is it well executed? Yes.  It offers a unique enough experience to stand on its own with the use of power-ups and thrusting to give it more variety and allow for great speedruns. :D Worth a buy if you are into your competitive running games. Only thing this game needs is a Level Editor (ship editor would be nice too) and it would be just that much better. Better graphics maybe too, but they are functional and not too bad. :)UPDATE: Level Editor has been added recently with full workshop support!			",1854,652,92,216,206,22,326
