Early Access Review
								I might be able to recommend this game if it wasn't horribly pay to win.Evidence:-With real money, you can buy equipment that is twice as good as what you can buy with in-game currency.-With real money, you can equip shells that make you do 50% more damage.-With real money, you can *rent* premium vehicles. They are phenomenally strong.There is no obvious or easy way to earn the real currency. Until this is changed, it doesn't matter how fun the game may be, I can't recommend it. I will change this review to reflect gameplay if these extremely unfair mechanics are changed.			",1458,503,66,253,230,26,306

								In many ways a quicker and somewhat more action oriented World of Tanks.  Combat is decent, and the variety between the 4 classes of vehicles is okay.  Steering/driving is reasonably responsive while still having a good feeling of weight.  Weapons don't have quite the same feeling of impact or weight, unfortunately, and are fairly simple, but they work. Unfortunately with premium purchasable vehicles with higher stats and gold premium ammo that does higher damage, I simply cannot recommend the game.  The game itself is decent, and free, and worth taking a look at if you have a decent internet connection for the download, but the potential pay2win monetization means I cannot, will not, invest the time to explore deeper or recommend it.

								it's p2w.  I'd love to see vehicle combat games make a comeback but this isn't the way to do it.  Consumables bought with gold, the premium currency, are literally twice as effective as anything a free player can get.  There is even premium ammo you can buy that gives you 50% more damage.

								This game has a few very nice features. The vehicles aesthetics are nice, they look straight out of a sci-fi war movie and there is some potential in the game modes.But the negative most defiantly out way those two positives. Game play is ruined by a ridiculous auto aim system.The vehicles feel unresponsive and dull. Graphics and audio are very dated.Watch this video for a more in-depth look.

								the entire game is just BAD 1) the UI is a total rip of world of tanks 2) the vehicles feel like the emegency brake is on all the time3) gun sounds and damage models on ALL vehicles is complete ♥♥♥♥♥4) this game was obviously made by people who have no knowledge on the english language (example was on the first loading screen and reads as follows: engineer can heal team with by right on button mouse)5) and lastly this game is EXTREMELY pay to win with vehicles,ammo and consumables that you can buy with gold (in game premium currency bought with real US dollars or what form of real money you use) that give 50 to 75% boosts to damage resistance,damage delt and what ever consumable you bought (repair kit or in this case Large armour kits vs the cheaper small armour kits you buy with in game currency earned in battles which only heal by 15% vs the 50% of the premium ones) All in all this game could have been great but it just isnt,also for it to make you feel like you want your money back even though its a free game its pretty ♥♥♥♥♥.)

								When i first clicked on it i thought it was some different version of MWO (Mech Warrior Online)[www.mwomercs.com]. No it isn't, its some P2W russian World of Tanks parody. The models are loosely based on Russian Armoured Personnel Carriers, Infantry Fighting Vehicles, Rocket Artillery etc.In general the game is terrible, UI sucks, crazy P2W,unbalanced matches, but apart of that what poked my eyes most were the name suggestions. When you type in a taken name it shows a set of suggestions and they're ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious, I'll toss in a few examples: when i typed ♥♥♥♥♥ they suggested me Holy_Hard_♥♥♥♥♥, when typed Gay they come up with Gay_Hunter, instead of Obama they recommended me Knicks_Murder_Obama, when i typed in Sex, they recommended me to choose Loud_Great_Sex, well sure why not? What was strangest of what I found is that suggested names sometimes get outright political undertone and often the kind which is not very popular in Russia, for example typing in Assad, they suggested me ""Maniac_Assad_Murder"". Could this be the beginning of the rise of AI?I've took a few snippets of these ridiculous naming suggestions for curious people:http://i.imgur.com/FXax8bo.pnghttp://i.imgur.com/1XbhPOA.pnghttp://i.imgur.com/OTOMxJf.pnghttp://i.imgur.com/bMNTdkJ.pnghttp://i.imgur.com/ru6tKIy.png ",123,34,4,13,7,2,18

Early Access Review
								Tried it out, got about 5-6 matches in. Good concept, though poorly and greedily executed. I love vehical battle games but this really couldn't do it. My issues below.-Servers are in buttcluck Europe/Russia somewhere. I can normally get 120-160 ping from UK and germany, but I get 200-260 in this game.-Super Pay to win. There are many things in this game that trump over non paid currency items and that quickly became evident when playing.-Not beginner friendly. Practically zero tutorial. Almost nothing to give you the basics or what you should be doing.-Not beginner friendly PT 2: Because the game population is so small (said 320 logged in when I was playing) you will be put up against much higher ranked opponents often. Items/weapons/vehicles in this game are everything, and I often got my ♥♥♥ handed to me by high tier players with larger vehicles that can one shot my beginner scout, or high tiers scouts that can two shot my beginner scout. Skill gap plus an additional MASSIVE GAPING equipment gap when you're starting off. Leveling will be an uphill battle unless you give them the sweet money they are trying to milk from you.-Auto aim: Everything I had a chance to try on three different chassis are all auto aim. I am assuming the rest of the game is the same. Come on. Auto aim on PC? Even if you like your precession auto aim, this further increases the equipment/pay to win gap and diminishes any skill for the game.-Heavy Russian population/salty player base. Anyone who plays games with large Russian populations is likely well aware how toxic and angry a good number of their players seem to be. Almost all players I met in this game were Russian. Out of 5-6 matches that I played, there was one where I accidentally bumped a big tank with my little scout. So what did the rest of the team decide to do? 3 Russian players on my team decided to team up and spend the rest of the match ramming and trapping me to walls and various surfaces. All I did was be a noob and accidentally bump someone (which caused no damage)-Pacing is slow: This might have something to do with the beginner scout and tank, but both are painfully slow. and under armoured. Some non beginner scout class appear to be faster, but not by much. Considering most things have wheels in this game, I feel like I am going the speed of a WW2 tank.So yeah, can't recommend. I love these kinds of games, but this one? Skip it.			",223,22,10,22,26,3,14

								Fun game, but after a while you realized almost every item is bought with real money/gold, and the ones which are not and paid for with in game money well it takes forever to get in game money, thus spending money to get it.  Sorry but this game reminds me of APB Reloaded without the cheats, meaning unless you have premium for faster money+xp, you will be grinding forever until you're old and dead lol. Bottom line: Bascially without premium game is pointless to play. And at this point, i don't feel like spending a great deal of cash to play a game, not a online game anyway.  Great game though, just saying. But seeing how this game has over 3000 players, i guess plenty of people is spending cash. Good luck to the staff/devs though.			",160,21,7,42,9,0,19

								The base game is free and is fun to goof around with for a while.  There are some issues that would need to be addressed before I would continue to play it, or recommend it to a friend:- Matches felt unbalanced- There is very little help available for the UI in game- No control over which location or what type of matches to play in- The cash store contains many items that would give players an unfair advantage in exchange for real moneyMy personal opinion is that I would wait until this game matures a little and see if it becomes more balanced.

								Game would be good if it was not a Pay-2-Win game. Game has a very lopsided battle EX: (You Lv 30, has a tank with 8k health and 15k damage per minute, there the game puts you to play against a whole team that is Lv 50 with the tank 15k health and 30k damage per minute, not counting the items purchased with money not to take damage, restore health, to 50% more damage on each attack, and so on ...)  no chances of you win, the game will always prioritize the victory for those who spend money buying account vip and premium tank. If playing this game, do not spend a penny with him, save your money for some other game better.Still the same s****.			",35,4,2,0,5,0,0

								Could have been a good game but...... Only Russian servers which makes ping high and causes lag. No balance off any kind, maybe cause of only 200-400 people playing so you end up in matches right off    the bat against top tanks that have been modded all the way so you stand no chance at all. Alot of the matches are only 3 or 4 players per side and quit often you end up either trying to fight the enemy by yourself or with one other cause 1 or 2 either quit or are afk the whole match. Very pay to win as they have tanks you can rent with gold (real money) that gives a person the upper hand. Very few players that even speak english..lol..I guess this could be a plus or negative for some. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game lets players who have maxed everything demolish players who are new. There is little control of matchmaking that prevents maxed out vehicles fight along/against new ones. Normaly this isnt a big problem but the upgrades available will more than tripple most vehicle damage outputs. It is hard to earn XP and in game money when everyone one shots you and your peashooter. P2W aspect isnt as big or as noticable as in some games so it is hard to tell if someone baught what they are using or earned it. The bad english translations in the tips are pretty amusing though.

Simple this game should have never been Greenlighted for the simple fact If you are givin a ban half the time you dont know what its for as its in damn Russian. Dont expect any help figuring out items ingame as the websites in fricking Russian. Dont thing your going to get any help in chat as the mods are too busy dealing with 10 year old brats to be able to give you the time of day. I have been asking for 4 days where these Dual Pod Artillery guns are coming from, they arent in the store but while you get 1 shot from your gun these things rain down like 8 shells on you. the start panel that gives news hasnt been updated in months and I could go on for and hour about other things.

								This could be a good game except for the fact that the majority of the time you're travelling and a fraction of that time you're fighting for 30 seconds or so. That's supremely boring. Also this game is about the most microtransaction heavy I've ever seen. You absolutely must spend money for the best gear. I don't mind supporting a game, but this is excessive.

								Surprisingly elegant vehicle shooter with gameplay that's easy to get into. Several game modes with lots of customization for different weapons, consumables and so on, complete with upgrade progress. As a free game, certainly worth a few hours of simple entertainment.Beware, however, of an iceberg of pay-to-win design hiding in its complex interface.			",1349,442,54,173,177,24,216

								I gave the game a decent chance and can say overall it isn't worth it. Even with premium you level at a snails pace. Were talking hours to reach level 3. This is with VIP so without it is way way worse.Artillary gameplay is awful overall compared to WOT and feels like your barely participating etc.. Engineering amounts to get rushed down by any vehicle in the game and hope your teammates kill them. The tech tree is non existant. Basically it's click improve on some parts and swap guns if yours has any. Also improvements go to 40+ for basically any component in the entire game.Now for the next big issue is matchmaking. So, a newer game released with MM that sticks completely wrong tiers vs each other. Also matches take ages so you get to feel entire stomps for long periods. We had a match where I was a T1 engineer with 3+ T1 scouts and T1 tanks vs things up to tier 3 and no T1's on the entire enemy team.Basically skip this. Also it's minorly p2w and the dev claims hes fixing it.			",153,3,3,5,7,1,13

								Pros:The Game worksThere are several Vehicles to unlockSeveral Maps and Gamemodes (Deathmatch and Capture the flag is what I saw)Shooting is easy and intuitive.Cons:The cars are slow and unexciting.The Capture the Flag Gamemode is VERY boring.The game is ugly.Sound effects are lacklustre. Big turrets shouldn't sound like stepping on particularly crackly grass.

								I enjoy this game very much.Pros and cons.ProsEasy to play (W,A,S,D,Shift,Mouse,Controls)Multiple modes  (capture the flag, destroy the enemy and others)Lots of Vehicle upgradesLots of VehiclesConsExperience based on your contribution to the fightThat's what I have seen so far. 1. Is the game P2W (Pay to Win)? A lot of the things in the market you can purchase with silver, which you make with every battle fought. The equivalent of the silver item in the gold (gold is bought with real money) markey is much better, but you can still purchase a like-item with in-game currency.2. Is the game a copy of World of Tanks (WoT)?Nowadays people say that to please themselves. Honestly, I hated WoT but I like this one very much. If a War game is a copy of another war game just because there is infantry and weapons, armor and enemy units, guess what, it's a War game...			",67,11,1,23,3,0,11

								A lot of people these days are just looking for a reason to yell pay to win. I think this game has a large integration of its cash shop to the point its almost invasive but I don't feel this game is pay to win so narrowing down all the negative reviews about that you are left with some key points.-Graphics to me are great, they feel a bit dated but still carry the aestetic perfectly its a very enjoyable environment.-Controls were a LOT smoother than I initially figured, but the starting cars drive like radio control cars.-The arenas have a great sense of scale and ambient noise it really brings you into the universe, the car to car audio voices get old fairly fast wish we could customise them or SOMETHING.-There is a ""console aim"" like in the old xbox console shooters where it gives you some assist aim on automatic weapons, you can take that as bad or good.-A great team dynamic reminds me a lot of chrome hounds in the class of vehicles, I look forward to trying all the vehicle types.Its free, and its fun I suggest everyone give it a shot. Worst case you can try it and not like it so you have a reason to come back to this review and yell at me. Best case you have a new fun free game. Win-win.			",308,37,8,56,27,1,52

								Played one match in the game. Not only won, but came in first out my team mates. Upon further inspection I realize my success was due to OP paint job.. yea.. a paint job. Apparently paint jobs or more than just for looks.  Looking at the store as well shows the game is super heavy pay to win. Such a beautiful young game, but that just muddied its waters and im not gonna fish in it. The strongest heavy tank you can freely obtain in the game has an armor base of 7500, but if you purchase their premium heavy tank it has 15,000 armor points! That's absurd. As fun as my one match was, I would not touch this again. Pay to win is a bad game market to delve into. It shows the makers only care about money.			",60,9,0,8,15,1,17

I cannot recommend it simply because of severe balance issues at times... Otherwise, I think it is fine and could be better with more maps... Hoi9wever, when the blancing is off, it is way off.  Also, need a mechanism to balance a battle where a team member just simply never plays tyhat round...  You had 4 members against 4... but one of them never started on your team... so you are down one... AND their empty vehicle keeps respawning to become a victim... Either a way to replace that person... OR.... at the very least stop them from respawaning...  Something..Not sure if ther balancing issue is due to not enough players in the queue to make up a battle. Sso they work with what they have???In my experience withg PVP, you play level one player with level one players... Here, they try and mix it up... that CAN be good with a proper balance ( and hopefully, likewise balance play styles)  Example:Team one   stormtank  Level 50engineer    Level 15Artillary     Level 20Scout         Level  5Team Two   stormtank  Level 50engineer    Level 15Artillary     Level 20Scout         Level  5However, this is not what I see mostly.. Worst example: I was brought into a battle the other day against a 5 member Clan with mostly level 50's agains a mismatch of players with much lower Levels....Might as well have been unarmed civilians against the Mechanized Warbots--------------Playable teams/Battles??""? YES... on occasion...Recommend more DEV work on balancing or gaining more players to balance with...    AND.... some more maps.With that work... BALANCING at min, I would bump it up to 7.5....  more maps and such I could riase it a little more..Not sure it could ever be a 10.. but it could be a sweet 8.5 casual PVP game. ",25,3,1,2,7,0,8

								Blatant copy of World of Tanks with respawn and faster movement, especialy the turret turning. The idea was to make the game more exiting.

								Metal War Online: Retribution is a game I have been playing a bit recently. I have to say I like it, it plays like a cheaper World of Tanks but it looks scifi. For the layperson the game works by having you queue up into matchmaking as one of a large variety of vehicles in out of 4 classes, scouts (light vehicles) ""stromtanks"" (tanks), engineers, and artillery vehicles. after selecting your vehicle and gear (smoke screen, scanner, nitrous, etc.) you are dropped into a game. There are a few different game modes, you have modes where you capture points and turrets, capture the flag, and team deathmatch type modes. Concerning the maps, there are a good deal of them, just under 20 at last count. The higher level you get, the more maps you unlock to play, at least from what I can tell.  Really I would recommend Metal War Online: Retribution to anyone looking for a fun free to play vehicle based shooter, or to anyone looking for something to substitute there World of Tanks cravings without actually playing World of Tanks.
