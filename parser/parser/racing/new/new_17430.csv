												Where do I start with this...Need for Speed Undercover has been bashed, beaten & overall just despised by the entire Need for Speed community, often described as ""one of the absolute worst Need for Speed games ever made"". But, judging you see that giant blue thumbs up, you obviously can tell that I don't think that way.Now, those of you who really hate long reviews (because there's gonna be quite a lengthy one ahead), here's a short pros-n'-cons review to not waste your time:Pros:+Can run on a toaster+Great soundtrack+Huge car selection+Easy-to-follow story+Simple controls that are even very playable on a keyboard+Visuals are passable+Gameplay is rather funCons:-Story is inconsistent and highly forgettable-Visual glitches regarding the sky & the sun (sun flies from one part of the screen to the other while the sky spins in a nauseating fashion)-Horrible racer & cop AI-No ""Perfect Start"" (a prominent feature in Most Wanted, Carbon & World)-Steam Overlay (unfortunately) does not work with Undercover, due to EA not patching out the old, outdated Steam Overlay DLLs in the game's filesDo I recommend?If you just want a racing game where you could really care less for story & want one that can run on your toaster computer, then yes, NFS Undercover should fill that niche for you quite nicely & I recommend the game for the price it's asking.Now then, short review done. Let's get on with the long review!The Story & The Characters:I'm not gonna bother with a brief synopsis of the story, since that's what the store page basically tells you. But what I will give will be my thoughts on the story. So. I think the story in Undercover is garbage. It's very sloppily put together. Some characters come & go without a proper explanation, some characters are given NO INTRODUCTION and just sort of...appear, other characters for some reason or another just swap roles mid-story, eh, you get the point. I get that it's to be expected that a racing game will have a terrible story, but back when this game was announced & being promoted like the next best thing, it tried to take itself seriously, with all the trailers & promotional videos. So, yes, the story is trash, introduces characters & gets rid of characters periodically & tries to take itself way too seriously, which is why I don't like it & find it very forgettable. It shouldn't take you more than 10 hours to beat the entire story, I, for one, beat the single player campaign in around 8 hours & now am doing my second runthrough on the Steam version of this game, just for the sake of adding in more gameplay hours.The Visuals & Audio:Before I move on to the meat of the review, being the gameplay, I wanna briefly go over the game's visuals. They look...passable. Now, I've had the pleasure of experiencing this game both in 1080p Ultra Settings & 360p Very Low Settings, and generally - I am impressed with the framerate. The game (for the most part) is very consistent with the framerate on newer hardware & back when my good PC was still alive & played this game for the 8 hours it took to complete the single player campaign, the framerate was crazy-stable at 60 FPS, with sometimes dropping below when there were too many cops at once, which is understandable. As for the visuals themselves, everything in the game world, including the road you drive on & the water beyond the shores looks ""alright"" at best. Yes, Black Box has done MUCH better in terms of visuals in Carbon & even Most Wanted, but I don't think the game looks ugly by any means, but certainly doesn't live up to the 2008 year it came out on. And the audio? The car sounds are remarkably pleasant to listen to, giving off the feeling that the car you drive FEELS like an actual car and not a freaking go-kart. The soundtrack is picked rather well & there are a handful of songs I don't like, sure, I like most of the soundtrack.The Gameplay:And now, we move on to the meat of the review - the gameplay. Need for Speed Undercover's gameplay tries to emulate the critically-acclaimed gameplay of Most Wanted & Carbon while trying to introduce enough new things to stand on its own. First of all - the controls are great. Every car feels very responsive & turning even with the slowest of muscle cars while using a keyboard, not a controller or wheel, felt super reliable & the car showed no signs of delayed turns or any kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t some racing games usually have, which is great, as great control is what makes the game great. There are, however, a few things I really don't like about the gameplay. Gone from Most Wanted & Carbon are perfect starts, which require to get your speedometer stick on a certain part of the actual speedometer when it changes color to give your car a bit of a necessary boost when you start, unless you want to drag on for about 30 seconds, trying to catch up to your opponents. Thankfully though, Undercover's AI is built around the lack of perfect start, so it's not like they'll speed up instantly, no, they'll generally start out at pretty much the same pace as you do. NFS Undercover has a multitude of game modes, with a few brand new game modes, never-before-seen in any previous Need for Speed game, or even any sub-sequent games - Jobs & Highway Battles. Briefly about the other game modes - they're standard fare what you'd find in other Need for Speed games - you got Circuit, Sprint, Checkpoint, Outrun (making a return from Underground 2) & Police Events. About those ""exclusive"" game modes, as it were. First - Jobs. Jobs are essentially your character stealing a car & then driving said car to a drop-off point, meanwhile cops are after your ♥♥♥ and your goal is to escape the cops & get to the drop off point. This game mode doesn't have a time limit of any sorts, so you can breathe in relief, however - some jobs do have damage meters, which are rather easy to deplete. Highway Battles are sort of glorified high-speed canyon events from Need for Speed Carbon, just with ♥♥♥♥-tons of traffic & only 1 stage. The goal in Highway Battle is to get ahead of your opponent & lead by 300 m (or 1000 ft if you're using the Imperial system) whilist trying to not wreck your car with the insane amounts of traffic around you. These 2 exclusive game modes are generally executed very well, with the opponent AI sometimes being crafty enough to try and block your path by purposefully pushing traffic cars into you & they take advantage of every opportunity to overtake you and make your day horrible, should you ♥♥♥♥ up midway in the race. Making a return from Need for Speed ProStreet is domination, but this time - instead of completing an entire area to ""dominate"", dominations are handed out if you can manage to beat the developer time for each race in the game, not counting Jobs. Early game, beating the developer ""domination"" time is quite easy, but later down the road - it gets more & more difficult. For Customization - if you've played ProStreet & seen that game's insanely expansive customization system, then Undercover will bring nothing new and you can jump straight in. But for the new guys? I'll throw it out there right now - customizing your car (other than its performance) does nothing and won't give you any benefits like in ProStreet. They're just there if you want your car to look nicer, but be warned - if you will ever decide to play online (which will happen only if you have someone who plays this game after 7 years), your vinyls that you apply to your car will not be shown. Why? Who the hell knows, but they disabled it. I haven't spent much time in the customization menu myself, so I really can't comment on anything here.Final Verdict & Score:Due to the Steam Review Character limit, the rest of this review is in screenshot format.[puu.sh] ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												About 5+ years ago, I got this on release, and played this on Xbox 360. I hated it. I absolutely thought it was the worst game that could have ever been produced.Recently I bought this at a Steam sale, thinking that I might as well just put down my $5 into some random cheap racing game, hoping it would provide even an hours entertainment. I'm so happy with this purchase. I regret my constant stream of hate.Granted, this is definately not the pinnicle of NFS (Underground 2/Most Wanted 2005 will always be), and that's clear through some poor design desicions regarding the lack of a main menu, the fact you can't change graphics quality until you actually get to play the game (about 5 minutes of cutscenes), and even the fact that there's too much bloom and there's some weird glitches with the lights floating a la Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing.But, with all the negatives said and done, this...this is the most fun I've had in a racing game in years. It seems like the devs tried to be as faithful as they could to Most Wanted, while still moving forward with the rest of the game. The cars control FANTASTICALLY on PC compared to console, and the selection of vehicles is awesome, especially considering the Bugatti Veyron (which, gladly thanks to the Master Events balancing the field, isn't game-breaking). The length of the game is awesome, with a huge amount of things to do. The police chases are fantastic, and polished much further than Most Wanted (admittadely though, I'll always prefer the down-right hilariously poor AI of Most Wanted's cops, and their over-the-top voice acting).Overall, this really probably didn't recieve a lot of the backlash it got from fans. If you're a Most Wanted fan who has been disillusioned with the Need for Speed franchise as of late, you can do no harm in buying this game and reliving a time just before Criterion broke everything. And before The Run existed...			",387,122,25,41,48,4,47

												In this review I will give you detailed information about the version differences between the Steam and Origin versions of Need for Speed™ Undercover.- First of all, the Steam version of Need for Speed™ Undercover isn't patched and doesn't have the so called ""Challenge Series"" (Origin version does include those!).- Secondly, the Steam version doesn't have lag spikes caused by additional DRM (SecuRom) because this DRM isn't present in the Steam version, but unfortunately it is present in the Origin version of Need for Speed™ Undercover. To get rid of the annoying lag spikes, you have to apply a ""custom"" game fix (v1.0.1.18).- Moreover, the Steam version of Need for Speed™ Undercover doesn't support the ""Steam Community Overlay""… unless you add it as a ""Non-Steam game"" (I know... funny). On the other hand, to be able to use the ""Steam Community Overlay"" while playing the Origin version of Need for Speed™ Undercover, you also have to add it as a ""Non-Steam game"" (note that ""Origin In-Game"" must be disabled so that the ""Steam Community Overlay"" would work when adding Need for Speed™ Undercover Origin version as a ""Non-Steam game"").Additional Notes: When adding the Steam version of Need for Speed™ Undercover as a ""Non-Steam game"", you also have to use a ""custom"" game fix (v1.0) to get pass the error upon launching the game after you have added it as a ""Non-Steam game"".P.S.: Long story short, even though I own the game on both digital platforms (Steam and Origin), I still had to use ""custom"" game fixes to be able to enjoy ~ The Way It was Meant to be Played™ ~ this actually beautiful game!

												Think of this game as the younger, try-hard brother of NFS: Most Wanted (2005).It's like MW, but this time...- Cops don't go airborne when you hit a roadblock- It has oversteer and understeer. And everywhere-steer.- The heat system no longer makes sense- Crashing into traffic still counts as a ""near miss"" (lol)- You can't get cars out of impound- It's got bad music- Physics are somewhat buggy when you do manage to get airborne- Multiplayer servers are completely shut down... however...+ Feels like it's directed by Michael Bay + Cool graphics!+ Visible damage+ Well-paced story+ Not just racing; attempt to ""take down"" (bust) racer criminals+ Extensive list of ""modern"" cars (more or less)+ Minimal menu-stuffing-aroundCool game you can knock off in a short amount of time. Doesn't quite retain the feel of the edgy Most Wanted vibe, but it has its replay value. 7/10			",43,8,2,10,3,1,7

												Despite the obvious issues with the game, such as sun glaring into tunnels through the walls and into your eyes, the skyboxes randomly spinning around you, and heavy police SUVs easily outrunning a Veyron, it is a fun game.It's fun, but a bit too easy at times. Almost depressingly easy. So easy, you'd want to keep a lower-leveled car around just to give yourself a challenge.No, seriously. Except for one time some dude in a Dodge Viper challenged me to a 1-on-1 race, I still outran him in a 1969 Camaro. Sure, it took me 20+ tries, but I did it.And finally, children: Don't be afraid to alt+F4 the game if you're about to get arrested and you know you wouldn't be able to afford the impound retrieval costs. It's easier to spend a minute loading the game back up than it is getting enough money to get another car.			",97,5,2,7,10,2,1

You are a cop undercover and must be bad to get trusted and so on, but you dont do no boring bad guy stalking stuff, all you really have to do is simply race and run from cops, the game's campain will indeed follow you on its own.

												One of the most underrated series of nfs.It has lot of cutscenes, and nice storyline to follow on.Only two problem makes this game underrated than it has to be. First problem is the ridiculous difficulty on some races such as I need to beat SLR Mclaren with EVO. But it is not that big because you can get pinkslips as you clear other missions and easily collect money and buy a better car.The biggest problem is physics which breaks the game and makes player difficult or sometimes almost impossible to control the car.But overall great game with big open world, Which is the last nfs with STORY, COPS, TUNE UPS, and FREEDRIVE.See what happened to NFS these days. They are just burnout series with supercars. No more storyline, unique tune ups, and thrills which really suck.간만에 해보는데 뽀샤시한 그래픽, 스토리라인이 좋음 최고의 혹평을 받았던 게임인데 거기서 알수 있듯 굉장한 개적화와 썩은 물리엔진을 보여준다썩은 물리엔진이 혈압을 오르게하지만 기본적으로 뽀샤시한 느낌과 오픈월드가 좋아서  할만은 하다.

												I bought this game for around 5 bucks and after finishing it I'm not completely, but very disappointed so I give this game a thumb down. Main reason for this: This game has NO replayability and you probably won't even bother to finish it. Reasons see below.First of all: The races and missions are always depending on luck, I guess. Some races / missions are ridiculously easy, some are nearly unbeatable. Sometimes you flee from the police and you're completing the mission in under a minute and the next day you're failing at a similar mission even after ten tries. Especially the high way battles (where you have to stay ahead for x seconds or lead at least for x meters) are unfair beyond belief. Sometimes I thought a race against light itself would be easier.Mission vary from 'Sprint', 'Curcuits', 'Getaways', 'Cop takeouts', 'Causing costs to state' (boring as hell, since you only gain XP, and no money at all) and some missions, where you always have to get away or take out some other drivers.The ""Speed braker"" adds a great deal of fun to it. Which brings me to the fact that, when you hit the wall, you will ALWAYS end up being either stuck exactly when not more than 90° to the wall or completely reserved when you try to accelerate / manouver your way out. After so many hours and races it happened constantly, so I'm sure the makers thought: ""Well, the game is already unfair hard, what else can we do to frustrate a gamer? How about your car gets stuck or completely reserved after hitting a wall in a tiny bend?""And of course, like in every single racing game: ALL other racers are in one place. Meaning when you're at 1st place and you make just a tiny mistake ALL other racers will overtake you and you're last. And believe me, the other racers in the later races are getting REALLY hard and unfair, like hitting your tail and stuff. And guess what? You always have to be 1st, or you won't get any reward. Why didn't they thought of a 2nd or 3rd place, with at least a part of the money to show some appreciation of the time I spent on that race?I also missed an ""Test drive car"" - option before purchasing a car. Wasting a fortune for the Bugatti Veyron (which accelerates like a rocket and steeres harder than a tank with a house on top of it) is kinda disappointing. Oh and don't expect ANY reward for finishing the game, like all cars, bling bling money, a special car, gimmick, anything else etc - you're not getting anything, except closing credits.The tuning system is easy to use and minimalistic, except where you can buy a paint job. Worst. Interface. Ever, if you use a controller. I even had to use keyboard plus controller to do a paint job. Well done, makers, really. Are you satisfied with all the drugs you take?The game gets harder and harder, but not in a challenging, but an ultra-unfair way which will drive you (no pun intended) effin insane. I played half of the game with the first Muscle Car I got via a Pink Slip, until I could afford an Audi Quattro TT. This went good for a while. After I bought the Zonda from Tier 1 I had absolutely NO chance in a race, because I hadn't enough money to buy also both Power and Handling - ""Ultimate"" packs for my car, which all of the other cars obviously had. Frustrating, because I had to go back to my already maxed out Audi and finish a dozen races under my current league until I could afford the upgrades.I also tried to cheat because I nearly smashed my controller through my LCD into the wall. Cheats are absolutely, f-word ridiculous. There is a cheat for 10.000 credits. Nice, eh, typing it in a thousand times and go shopping big time, eh? Nope. It's, like all cheats, a disposable cheat, meaning you only can use it ONCE. Like the game itself. Disposable. So in a game where cars cost about 300.000 credits and not to mention tuning and upgrade packages where you could buy a whole city, 10.000 credits as a disposable cheat ain't just quite cutting the deal. Where they drunk when they made those game plus cheats? No, they were obviously thinking about letting another good franchise going down the drain big time.Oh, and by the way. How can you tell you're playing NFS? After you've reached your maximum speed of ~350km/h, you're gonna be overtaken. By a flying police jeep of two-and-a-half tons. And all other enemies. Speed's just a number, after all, eh?So the longtime-fun is found somewhere else, this game has absolutely no value left after a few races or about maybe ten hours. I now own the Zonda with all upgrades and the races got too hard. Just a single minor mistake or getting hit by another driver (who drive like they're in effin Carmageddon) and you can restart all over. I mean, I'm not a pro gamer, either I'm bad at it, I just want a racing game to be fun, race now and then a few circuits, have fun. And not be frustrated more and more AFTER I have the best equipment in the game and finished it already.Further you get stuck later in the game. I finished the game. Now I own the Paganini Zonda, a Lamborghini Gallardo, an Audi Quattro TT, a Porsche GT2 and a few pink slips from other cars (which can't be sold, just be removed. Sense, please?). The latter missions will earn you 25.000 to 35.000 credits and you will spend it all on cars, upgrades, paint jobs and aftermarket stuff (like spoilers etc). But then, after maybe four, five fully upgraded cars there's no races left (only old ones, which will earn you peanuts of 2.000 credits each or so), but there are still so many cars and upgrades left to try and buy. So when all the missions and races are won, you're gonna be stuck with your five good, maxed out cars. And you will have to start a new game to drive all the other cars. Where are the good old times, when finishing a racing game unlocked the complete car list? I'm not willing to start five new games just to see, drive and have all cars in the game. Here are also some other thoughts:Menues: The menu is very well sorted, tidied up and everything is easy to use, even with a controller. Great! That's how you do it. Bravo.Intros: Couldn't care less about these annoying things and they are not skipable. Cutscenes are skipable, after you've played the mission once.Graphics: Graphics are not important in a game. NFS:U is acceptable, there are games with better and worse graphics. For me (I own an older pc) they were just fine and, like said, of no importance.Story: I couldn't care less about a story in a racing game. I mean, what's the big deal? Car, this is player, player, this is your car. Take the controller, hit the buttons, wipe the floor with your enemies and have fun. Early in the game I muted the volume of ""Voice"" in the menu to 0, because in one mission I had to chase someone and every two seconds a voice said ""Catch on"" or ""Go faster!"", like this wasn't the thing I was doing. Good thing after muting: All cut scenes were muted. So I didn't know what the story was all about but from what I saw the story was more boring, mediocre, filled with not B- but C- and D-movie actors.Overall: For a small price like five to ten bucks it's a great, action packed game to play now and then which will serve a few hours of fun until you experience the things I mentioned in my review.

												Standard NFS game. If you like this series before, you will like this as well. The stroy is a bit predictable, but it's OK. The game area is pretty big and varied, with a lot of life. I loved the county highway pursuits. Perfect casual racing game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a NFS game. It's still in the classic vein of games, like the 2005 MW and Carbon and such.The story, as always, is pretty garbage.The cars, as always, look nice.The cutscenes have sexy cars and bangable women, as always.The graphics are shiny, but ugly when you look at it close up, as always.The performance is decent to good in most cases, as always.The controls are responsive and driving feels good, as always.The customization is extensive for the visual aspects and utter linearly progressing dog ♥♥♥♥, as always.The only real new feature is the gradual performance increase you get when completing events. Things like +2% to engines or +20% zone income. Slight things, but they make you feel like you're progressing.It's the standard NFS experience, you know what you're getting into.It's worth it to everyone during a sale. Without one, I'd only suggest this to the most hardcore of NFS fans.Overall, it's a solid 7/10.			",533,172,24,62,98,8,72

												This is a very underrated NFS game.  Obviously, it's quite aged, but it is still fun and runs fine on modern hardware, Windows 10, and a Xbox One controller.  The story is cliche, but it's a decent excuse for the racing.  I found the drag race events in traffic completely awesome, and the copper ones are fun.  There's a boatload of rides that are still sexy and fun to upgrade 9 years later.  The driver skill system gives you a little incentive to do all the events too.  On the negative side, the Steam overlay doesn't work, the non-car graphics were subpar even for 2008, and the AI isn't great.  If you're an arcade racer fan, this is still a lot of fun and a worthy addition to your collection.  It may not be Most Wanted, Burnout, or Underground, but it's still a good game.

												This game is a bit old, but it is still fun to play. Good simple graphics, not really a high graphic game, but it still alright. This game does not demand a high system requirement to run. In this Need for Speed game you play as an undercover cop, trying to bust an illegal shipment. Feel what it is like to go undercover. You take on mission after mission, such as races, highway battles, and cop takedowns. Using the cash you have aquired through events you can buy new cars and upgrade them. This game does have online multiplayer, that is if you can find someone online or if you have a friend who can play with you online. Would recommend this game to others.			",18,1,1,0,2,0,0

												NFS:UC is another game in the NFS franchise, and features some pretty good police chase mechanics (evolved somewhat from NFS: Most Wanted) and some pretty high production value live action videos to set the scene, starring Maggie Q as your ""handler"", Chasey Lynn. You're going undercover by infiltrating a bunch of street racers who's obviously also up to no good. However, your ""boss"" may be up to no good herself... The cities are large, roads are wide, and there are plenty of chase-breakers as well as shortcuts and whatnot. There are 4 classes of cars, from regualr sports to superexotics, and 3 levels of upgrades for each. There are variety of races, from simple circuit to highway battle (get away from the other driver once you're in the lead), from knockout (last place is eliminated) to eliimination (crash target until he's disabled), from timed delivery (take this hot car to destination, no cops!) to cop challenges (take out 5 cop cars then escape), there are a variety of missions to accomplish, using wide variety of cars, all over the major areas of this city. While the production values are high, and chases can get exciting, the videos come out as a bit... hokey, and the final battle is quite lame. Some of the missions are freaking impossible by game's end as the cars are driving insanely fast, almost beyond human reflexes. Graphics are decent but not spectacular as this is an older game. All in all, NFS:UC is not quite as good as the original Most Wanted, but the new mission and race types are welcomed. The subsequent iterations, such as Hot Pursuit (3) and ""The Run"" attempt to capture the magic, but you'll have to read those reviews elsewhere.			",166,8,12,16,11,3,15

												Today,I am going to write a review about one of the most underrated games ever, about  NFS Undercover.	 Story +++	Need for Speed Undercover story is inspired or based at film ""The Transporter"" (original in french - Le Transporteur). However it sounds weird, it is really similar to the film. It fits very well and it gives game ""the right action"". Gameplay -	Step by step.  Driving model is one of the worst in the entire NFS history, but it is easy to learn it. Also there are more cars then in previous NFS games, more newer and faster cars (f.e. - McLaren, Bugatti and Pagani Zonda). Map is really big - there are 3 towns - Capital City, Western Town (or Town of Desert) and Suburb (or sth like that). About the city traffic... well the cars are like meteors - appears in middle of nowhere.  Graphics -	Graphics are really okay for the year 2008, however the car crash model is worse then in Need for Speed Most Wanted (2005). It feels more paper, the police cars cant get dmg that is seenable. Car design is pretty good, but not as good as in Most Wanted. And the biggest problem? The EA company absolutely doesnt give a f*ck about the dead parts. Like sometimes you can run through cars, objects or even spikes and it doesnt do anything.  Other +	+ working multiplayer+ cheap game (at ♥♥♥/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥)+ worth play again&again- low community (not many people) THE VERDICT	Need for Speed Undercover is great game with lovely story, but with lot of graphics/gameplay problems. Its still with working multiplayer and it is really easy to get it cheap, so definitely I recommend this game.  67%	 ",57,12,10,4,4,1,16

												----DONT BUY IT IF YOU WANT TO PLAY MULTI ONLY----i will be using nfs most wanted 2005 and nfs carbon as reference to review undercover (a lot) and thanks to my friend i played it again and this time i finished it .-so first of all if you already played nfs mw 2005 or carbon you'll understand how this game work very fast , the plot is not the best in the world but kinda entertaining , you play as undercover cop trying to take down car thieves and smugglers ,plot twist here and there ( real actors just like in MW 2005 and carbon) you can get 15h if you play only the main compagne.-big well detailed city to play and explore but it feels so lifeless , you just drive with no purpose except the races .-graphicly is much better then MW and carbon cause they didnt port this one from the ps2 version like they did with carbon (8 years and still looking good ) and dont try the hd texture pack on the steam version it wont work-voice acting is really good just like in the previous nfs games , perfect sound effect , but shity soundtracks ( the worst soundtrack in a nfs game yet )-gameplay is smouth and 2 new type race, Highway Battle (my fav) and stealing cars .but sadly no steam fetures like steam chat in game and screenshot .-the multiplayer was dead 5 years ago (EA shut down the servers since 2011) so if you want to buy this game just for the multi dont do it )i recommend this game to gamers that want some nostalgia cause it feels just like MW2005 but with updates7/10			",636,174,27,75,40,8,63

												I wish there was a ""Maybe"" option when it comes to recommending games, because it would be very useful right now.Short Version:If you've played Most Wanted (the 2005 one, not the utterly ♥♥♥♥ remake) like me; you'll probably not enjoy this game that much.If you haven't played MW; You'll most likely enjoy the game.More In-Depth:Story: Honestly, not really gonna care about story, since this a NFS game. Nobody has really cared about the story in racing games. So let's just skip to the most important part.Gameplay: Basically, this where the comparisons to MW come from. The controls are nice to drive, even with a keyboard, but compared to MW, it feels wonky almost. Especially the Speedbreaker, in MW, SB is very smooth when used and glides in and out. In UC though, it feels like the whole game just stops instantly with no flow. One thing this game DOES have over MW is the drifting. Drifting feels very fluid and nice to pull off. When it comes to speed, you feel fast, but, of course, compared to MW, it feels sluggish.UI: Ok, this is the first complaint with the game that isn't because of MW. The UI with a keyboard is just an ♥♥♥ to use. It feels very awkward and frustrating to try and flick through the menus.Cars: Another(and probably the last) thing UC has over MW is the cars. UC comes with an assload of cars with this kind of racing game. Ranging from muscle cars to exotics to tuners, this game has almost it all.Again I'll say it once and I'll say it again, If you've played MW, stay away, if not, go ahead, it's only $10.

												OK, here we go!First of all - STORY. Well, it is an excuse for racing. I am not going to go into details of it but in a nuttshell it is just as this-cutscene: ""Hey you! This and that happened, you have to race in order to bla bla!"" Like all the other games of this type you can not expect it to have some great story. What I am impressed by is the live action cutscenes. Maggie Q and the bunch are actually making an effort here. Don't get me wrong it is not like movie level acting but it is not like those in Most Wanted (the original one) where the acting was so bad that I cringed while watching. The Carbon actors did a good job on that game but here they took it to another level. And, c'mon, who doesn't like to see some of Maggie Q's boobs and legs (bit of Maggie Q bias here). OK, moving on! Gameplay! Oh, man! I don't know if I should laugh or cry. Here is where I got dissapointed big time. But I am getting ahead of myself. First of all- car list, one word-AWESOME! You get American, European and Japanese cars stacked in these cathegories and each contains the best of the chategory. The list is big, I wont get into all the cars. You can look them up on-line. They handle OK but I can not shake the feeling that the cars have no mass to them. It feels like I'm driving an RC car. The movements are cartoonish and sometimes I get the fieeling that I'm playing Mario Cart. There is none of that speed feeling that I used to get in Underground 2 or in Most wanted. NPC cars are a whole other story, they are able of quantum leap, turning 90° while going 250 kph and the worst driver in the race suddenly becomes awesome and just wizzes by you when you are just about to win. Police chases play a role in the game but not all that much. These bring their own set of surprises like Police SUVs that take on and subdue a Bugatti Veyron doing 350+ kph on a highway like it was nothing. Sometimes I got the feeling that I was playing a demolition derby rather than racing with them raming me like crazy. The one thing that made me angry the most were bugs. And there are a lot of them in the sence that it is a marketed product that somebody made money off. Invisible walls that my car ran into, jumping off in the air in the middle of the road from some kind of an invisible ramp and the grand daddy of them all-on the last mission my car fell through the texture and fell into nothingnes. This is where i went crazy. This game is a product like any other that was marketed as a functioning one. It chrashed on me a couple of times  (I have no idea why) but when my carr did the falling down into oblivion that was it for me. I would understand that if the copy of a game was....well... obtained as a leaked product. But I payed money for it and I expect it to work properly. In the end it feels like it is a rush job. I really want to meet the guy/gal who signed off the product as a good one so I can have some words with them about false advertizing. On the plus side the game runs on a toaster so you don't have to worry about your computer being too old and weak. You should always check the system requierments before purchasing but if you bought your machine in the last 5-8 years you should be good. The last but not hte least-car customizing engine is great and specially for the visual part. Performance has the standard kind of bussiness but they really made an effort in order to give you some really good options for making your ride stand out. The world looks good. It feels like your are racing in a big city but I could not help but feel that it is a huge construction site. So many construction cranes!!!! One other thing I noticed (in the start of the game, later is lost track) that you are racing a couple of same racers, wich makes sense. In the previos games I had the feeling that the town I was racing in had like half a milion residents and every school kid and nursing home grandpa, mom and dad, dog, cat were racing. Soundtrack- As a huge music fan (bigger than gaming) I must say that the track list is good and I discovered ome good bands while playing the game. Dear reader! I am not a serious gamer. So this review should not influence your decision of buying the product. By all means take a look at other reviews - there are some good ones by more expirienced gamers. My conclusion: Do I recommend the game......well....I have no idea. As I'm writing this sentence I am trying to figure out if I'll give it a thumbs up or down. There are good features of the game but I feel like they are outweight by the bad ones. If you are someone who is a casual gamer like me you might enjoy the game. But if you are a serious gamer with developed taste in games then I would not recommend it. Personally....I'll keep it installed for some more of the time so i can customize rides. :-D I think I'm giving it a thumbs down. Sorry EA!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Need For Speed Undercover. Intended to be a true successor to Most Wanted (The 2005 version...not Burnout Paradise 2), this game has received its fair share of hate and throughout all of these years, i never understood why to be perfectly honest. After the less then stellar Pro Street, i was extremely hyped for this game at the time and when i played it, initially i thought it was an absolute blast and lived up to Most Wanted in every way. But again, that was in 2008. How does the game hold up to today's standards?Well. Suprisingly well id say. Its not even close to how good i thought it was back in the day (Bare in mind, this was back when i loved racing games and i was a Total NFS fanboy) but its still a pretty exciting racer and the hate it received wasnt exactly what it deserved. It truly was the last TRUE Need For Speed, before the series would become Burnout (Hot Pursuit was basically Takedown, MW2012 is Paradise 2, as stated). That being said, lets get a few things out of the way. If your expecting a truly engaging story with memorable characters, unexpected plot twists and perfect pacing with pitch perfect acting...then just stop, like seriously. The story is completely disjointed and random. Stuff happens for no reason and characters come and go without any rhyme or reason. And the cutscenes...my god...the dialogue is without a doubt completely unbearable. Most Wanted and Carbon were cheesy, but in a way that gave it style. Here, it just feels forced...that or these people cant write or act at all. A particular character, Rose, is without a doubt the worst. Her dialogue is just the worst ive heard in awhile. Suffice to say, im sad that the story failed. The idea of being deep undercover of some kind of crime syndicate always intrigued me and EA couldve really did something here.Anywho, enough of the story. The racing and cop chases are where this game strive off of and i feel that while its not at the heights of Most Wanted, its still good enough that you can see yourself having allot of fun with this game. The sense of speed is crazy, and the car handling is less torpedo like and allows you to casually cut corners like a pro, which goes really far into making you feel like a real bad ♥♥♥! The courses are layered out with plenty of ways to overcome other racers and you always feel like you have a chance even if the race isnt going good. Then the police chases, which is one of my personal favorite mission types, are just pure intensity, particularly when your Wheelman level goes up and the odds against you get higher and higher. Also, i love the small touch of being able to press a single button to hop into another race on the spot. It allows you to simply hop into a match without surfing into map screens and i for one love the small touch. The game is extremely easy to run too. Throwing it on max settings shouldnt be too difficult and 60FPS isnt going to be far from reach either.This might be a preference thing, but the keyboard controls are Meh at best. You can totally work with it, as i found it atleast playable...but if you have a 360 Remote laying about, or any other form of Gamepad, id highly reccomend using it. The game feels much more slick this way and it really pays off.Now for the things i didnt like. The AI is inconsistent to say the least. In races, expect to always see the opponents lag MILES behind you. Even towards the end of the game, this happens pretty often. Im under the assumption that you could EASILY beat this game with the starter vehicle, which is kindda sad. Then theres the ""Master Races"" which is the perfect showcaser of why the series frequent use of Rubber Banding is a joke. You literally have to ensure you make NO mistakes...yet even when your doing perfect, someone will be glued to your ♥♥♥ like a Magnet and side swipe you when your close to victory. You can try to rear end them but they stay glued to the road as you plumet to the side of the road in shame. At these moments, i really wish we had the progression of Need For Speed Most Wanted, where the game got more and more difficult as you made your way down the blacklist. Hell, even Carbon with its Rubbery AI had a feeling of progession. As for the cop chases...they have issues too. Dont get me wrong, they are still fun, but the Police are just too forgiving. Cops often stand back, allowing you to easily out run them, and even in the higher intervals, they give you space to escape being boxed in. Also for whatever reason, they eventually call off all their units after awhile, abruptly ending a chase. The only thing that really gets you off guard is the Spike Strips, but thats only because you never even really see them.In the end, the game is definetly flawed. But id say its worth it. Especially now that its cheap and easily attainable through Steam. The racing is fun, and the chases can be a blast. The awful story and Inconsistent difficulty drag it down but nowhere near to the levels of a bad game. Its a solid racer and if your looking for something to play, look no further. PERSONALLY though, if you still have a Playstation 2 or a Nintendo Wii (Or a Wii U even), id reccomend hunting down a copy of Need For Speed Undercover on one of those consoles. It may not be the prettiest versions, but the AI is much better and consistent, the cars feel and handle better, the cop chases are a challenge and it just overall just feels more like a Most Wanted sequel then this version does.

												So I replayed this after some years passed, and as an avid NFS-Fan of the older titles, I wrote this review.Gameplay, World and Story:Good:» The open world, while boring looking, has many alternative paths and offroad-streets.» Good choice of cars (although I wish there were more older japanese vehicles).» Great modification (visual upgrades are on the same level as NFS:Pro Street).» Gameplay is very similar to the likes of NFS:Most Wanted and NFS:Carbon.Bad:» Horrible driving physics: Cars feel washy and oversteer at the same time, it's just weird.» Crashing into cops isn't as exciting as in Carbon/Most Wanted.» The in-game camera feels off (it sways weirdly).» Open world looks boring and uninspired.» Generic cutscenes.» Braindead Cop-AI.Misc:Settings:The game comes with a lot of settings. World details, car details and so on can be changed. However, the game does not support high resolutions such as 4K. The game has an immense amount of bloom, which can be turned off, but the game just looks ugly without it. I would also recommend turning on Vsync, as menus with sliders can glitch out on fast systems.Performance:Pretty good FPS on a modern system. Slight stutters.Summary:If some of the issues didn't exist (especially the driving-physics problem), it could've been a great game. I can only hope for some mod to fix this game in the future. But until then, I cannot recommend this game to anyone, even if you happen to get it for free.I returned my copy.Hey EA you money-bag, wanna make some easy dollar? How about putting up the older NFS titles for sale? I'd buy 'em. kthxbye ",64,4,6,5,3,2,0

												This got    quite a lot of bad press, but  for me it was one of my favorite Need for Speed titles   because of it's open wold like  feel.  It was  quite similar to the first Test Drive unlimited, tohugh with slightly better graphics in that you could wander aroun the   large area covering  several smalll towns  and  pick up missions as and when you felt like it.  It's well worth picking up  when Steam have one of their sales.  you'll probably get it  for  a few pounds.

Lay these out on the table leaving no spaces4: Get 1L of Mountain Dew and pour this all over your beloved cheese5: Now jump up onto the table6: Start surfing across the table (whilst dabbing furiously if you generally use manual controls - this represents gearbox in game) Enjoy !

												This game is... more enjoyable than NFS:MW 2012, which I spent like $60 when it came out because of the MW name, and I hate it so much.Undercover is a game that gives you a feeling that they rushed too hard during development, so it lacks testing, refinement, and thoughts. It carries quite a few promises, but is very disappointing.Pros:1. Fast-paced action easily makes one EXCITED!2. A good collection of cars.3. A nice world to roam about.4. Cut-scenes are quite well made.5. Chances are that you buy this game when it's on sale, very cheap.Cons:1. Physics is ridiculous, when crash happens, all cars seem to have infinite mass. Mario Kart has better physics and makes more sense. NFS is not famous for physics accuracy, but this game is way too off-scale.2. If you drive manual, you will easily feel that the cars' torque-rev relationship is pretty ridiculous.3. Brake is so ridiculously powerful, and the car has ridiculous amount of grip.4. They hired Maggie Q and others to make nice movies, so it seems that they focused on SP. However AI is ridiculous. Anything controlled by AI just makes no sense.5. AI racers seem to be ""given"" speed and accleration. Sometimes I can have 200 feet in the lead and I am faster round the last corner, but the second car just acclerates ridiculously and robs my first place. It feels that those cars do not have actual drivers in them.6. Roaming traffic cars are quite amazing, not only AI racers ram you like crazy, those roaming traffic cars also ram into you for no reason at all.7. There's almost no balance between cars and missions. You can win by miles using Lotus Elise against some really slow Volkswagen, and at some other locatons you will face Audi R8, Gallardo, and many other cars that are way faster. BTW Lotus Elise is extremely overpowered.8. I can't believe how bad the cops are. They seem to give up chasing you as long as you are 100 inches ahead of them. Sometimes it can be extremely hard to complete missions like cost-to-state challenge, because the cops do not chase you at all, even you are at heat level 5.9. You can easily use the TAB key to fast travel to just jump right to the next race, so although there's a huge amazing open world, chances are that you don't even roam about at all.10. Graphics are okay for a game this old, and it uses similar color scheme as the original NFS:MW. However it looks a lot less attractive than NFS:MW for some reason.11. Road surface is modeled quite badly. Different road surface (asphalt, grass, dirt, etc) feels quite similar, and the only difference seems to be the smoothness.12. Its compatibility with controllers has lots of problems. If I have my keyboard, XBOX360 controller, and my Logitech G27 all connected at the same time, the car will keep steering to the right, and the menu cursor keeps going down.13. The cars' performace has little to do with their real-life version.Conclusion:If this game is on sale, and if you want some excitment road racing, and if you are not good at braking in racing games, pick this up. It can make you blood boil (Rush-time High Way Battle is the best mode in this game IMO), and it does not require too much skill.			",85,14,25,4,4,0,6

												It was actually pretty fun, despite how everyone says it isn't as good, it is still a great game to play, racing in it just feels pretty fun. My Carrera GT looks pretty awesome as well. The soundtrack was pretty good as well, just great racing game music, you know. I just wish there was more races because I dominated all of them, so the game is kinda short. The story is kinda boring, but I just ignored it and raced more. And the map is pretty big, takes you quite a while to explore all of it. The only thing that annoyed me is that the police can impound your car, I had to buy another Carrera GT because of that. So just don't get arrested and you should be good. lol. It is pretty easy to race once you've gotten a fully upgraded tier one car. Also the tier system is reversed compared to carbon, 1 is fastest and 4 is slowest, so don't get confused. So basically, its fun to race in, easy after you get a tier 1 car fully upgraded, avoid getting arrested as you only have 3 strikes, and the map is pretty big. Cool, if you buy it, maybe you can message me, we can race sometime.			",41,3,5,4,9,1,5

												The NFS Undercover, in my opinion, is one of the darkest parts of NFS series. It isn't popular for multiple reasons, but that doesn't mean that this game doesn't have any strong sides.Advantages:+Good story - you are playing a cop working undercover. Your mission - find out who is responsible for stealing the cars from the port. Your tactic - infiltrating. You are not good or bad, you can't get help, you are on your own.+Variety of cars - 80 of them, separated in 4 classes+Customisation - make your car look cool by using lots of kits (5 actually), rims, spoilers, exhaust, paint types and decals+Atmosphere - the game has an atmosphere of Most wanted+Big, bright and nice world+Tracklist - 55 great tracks?Graphics - it is...O.K.Disadvantages:-Gameplay & Physics - cars feel very heavy, they have an INSANE grip and brake power. If you expect this game to be realistic, you will be very disappointed. It's not even arcade, it's something worse. And that's the main reason why people hate this game.			",41,3,6,0,3,2,10

												I purchased this game with the expectation it would be similar to need for speed most wanted - Buy a car, Buy upgrade parts, Evade the police, win races, progress the story - that is pretty much what I got.The reviews here on steam complain about how the car handles & the motion blur effect. The easist way to solve the car handling problem is to use a controller - some computer games are better suited to a controller while others are better suited to the standard keyboard & mouse. A controller makes it easer to adapt to the way the cars handle.As for the motion blur - I got used to it fairly quickly. According to google the game was released on November 18, 2008 - which makes it approximately 6 years old as I type this - and If I not mistaken motion blur was a 'feature' of older games used to make thinks look faster. This is speaking from prior experience, from recent memory I have beaten both need for speed most wanted & need for speed carbon (@#$% the final race in carbon) and they had a similar effect when using nitros.The biggest issue I had with the graphics - I was playing with everything as high as it would go, with the exception of using 1920x1080 due to my screen - and found the lense flair / sun glare to be near blinding. Honestly, more of an annoyance thean anything.I did also find the music tracks to be somewhat repeative, though I was to lazy to figure out how to turn it off. Something in the options menu I would expect.I didn't bother with multiplayer, I think the servers were taken down a while ago and I have no idea if this has any other types of multiplayer avalible.On the subject of the games difficulty - I found the artificial intelligence of the racers to be reasonable, difficult to beat if you are driving an underpowered car and / or didn't understand that you need to turn corners and avoid traffic to win. Yhe police artificial intelligence works well enough, through its nowhere near as effective as what was in need for speed most wanted, and they seemed to be able to keep up with me and even pass me despite driving waht appears to be lower tier cars - I'm guessing thats to give a fighting chane against a human player.TL;DRValue: DecentGraphics: DecentAudio: DecentMultiplayer: Maybe DeadDifficulty: Easy to Medium			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Wide selection of cars, colour wise not to sure about that the red looks like pink! but all the other colours are fine! Races are realy good the fact that the traffic is still there when you are racing is very realistic, cop simulation is kinda dodgy though they say the wrong things all the time, like 'suspect is driving a pink car' acually red!

												Honestly... when I first played this game, I had a great time. Usually I don't enjoy playings games without friends, but this one kept me busy for hours on end. The racing controls, even for a keyboard, are amazing. Most racing games on a PC with keyboard and mouse are frustrating, but this one is satisfying. It's not some Triple A game, and it shouldn't be compared with those sorts of games. It does what it does very well. A lot of people say the story is bad, but the story really isn't all that important in this game. It's about racing, and I feel like the story is just there to give you a reason to be racing. I'd definitely recommend this game if you're looking for time to kill. It's no masterpiece, but it can be a lot of fun.			",186,31,6,46,51,1,74

												This game is like no other need for speed it changes the gameplay, style and, somtimes even pace. Here are some pros and cons of this game.Pros:-Great Gameplay.-Good Graphics that have aged pretty good.-A nice car selection.-A fair storyline.Cons:-AI doesnt feel like it is trying in most races or pursuits but some missions can be very challenging.-The Story feels very short (but is an ok story overall).-a lot of races feel recylced.-There is not to much replayabilty in this game .Other Thoughts-The games soundtrack is ok but not quite as good as some other need for speed games.-There is a fair amount of cusomization in this game with the inclusion of AutoSculpt from Need For Speed Carbon however there is not neon or any trunk audio and fine (Mostly unimportant) customization like in Underground and Underground 2.-There is not a strong modding comunitiy like there is for games like high stakes so dont expect to many (If any) overhauls for this game however there is always a some car addons out there.This game has alot of personality to it, however may that be from the random (and sometimes comical) Police radio chatter or even just some cheesy cutscenes or music choices which add some real charecter to the game. In conclusion I think this game is about a 9/10 there is definitely ways this game could have been better but overall its a solid game and for the price you can't really go wrong. If you are on the fence about it I would recomend waiting for a sale.			",19,2,3,1,1,0,8

												While it may not be one of the more memorable NFS games, Undercover has a strange charm of its own. Making use of it's free roam feature, Undercover allows players to race, evade cops and set lap times on various points on the map. The various amounts of events may seem entertaining at first but loses it's appeal quickly. The races are dull and it becomes very easy to have a significant lead over the other racers. The color palette is obsolutely atrocious. Everything is painted in a dull brown which makes every corner and straight seem the same. There is a story component but it's easily forgettable unless you're a fan of Maggie Q. My advice would be to avoid this game and look elsewhere for a memorable NFS experience.

You could go from going to escaping the cops to a highway battle to making your car better and it goes on and on. The cars are even cool to look at even when not fully customized the graphics on high makes everything better.The graphics are amazing. I know the last good new graphic was advanced warfare on the ps4 but graphics cant make up for gameplay but the graphics here are good even to me. Say you played advanced warfare then played this game on all high and you would say wow because it stands out for a racing game which is amazing but if your thinking to buy this for $5.00 do it.

												Overall, an enjoyable game.Not a true NFS game, though.But an enjoyable one.Almost all races are unbelievably easy - I completed the game about 23 hours in. One race I was dragged sideways, giving the leader a 15 second lead and 40% left on the course, and I still caught up. The storyline is probably acceptable, although those cutscenes did have an air of that slightly high-end porn that you occasionally find when you dig deep enough. Fair amount of cars, with a decent range of classic American muscles, although the way to the Mazda MX7 and Lotus Elise. As a rule of thumb when buying cars, get ones with good handling. T4/3; Lotus Elise T2: Lamborghini Gallardo T1: Anything but the Veyron, which goes like the clappers and handles like a dead pig with no legs and a massive erection.Would not recommend buying at full price, but if it's on sale, and you're looking for a little bit of casual racing, get it.

												This game is really worth checking out there is a very good surprise ending I thoroughly enjoyed the game and after 17.3 hours of gameplay since about 2 I think was intro stuff not sure how much but I know at least 17.3 was spent playing the story and I know i'm not done with the game still the only thing I hate is how even with damage set to high that parts can't fail except by scripted events the engine is understandable but the other parts would be fun to see.

												Let's get one thing straight first controllers do work you need to be using a Playstation controller. I'm using a F310 Logitech.I also don't understand the people who say this game looks terrible. When the game first starts up it will be at a very low resolution but in the game options it can go up to 1920 x 1080. If anything this game is too shiny. Overall I would say it's an okay NFS game just a little too easy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For the price of the game, $9.99 as of 1/12/2014 it is a fun driving game, not heavy in the modding of the cars or adjustments, it is just a fun Need For Speed racing/out running the cops game. The graphics are pretty good for the age of the game and the car graphics are really nice. The car selection is enjoyable and the boards give you plenty to do...as I said before for what it cost its worth it.			",165,12,3,16,20,3,21

												Excellent game - can't be said as NFS Most Wanted's successor (The arcadey drivign is still there but unfortunately the physics is more realistic now), but it is very close. The visuals are amazing and the graphics have transitioned from being really cartoony to realistic and slick. There is miles and miles of road for you to race (or explore) on. Really nice, but could have been better. A definite buy though if on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The storyline is pretty good but can be pretty boring at times kinda a storyline you would expect out of a need for speed game very similar to others.

												This is the first Need For Speed game i have ever played other then the first one that came out and i have beaten this one all the way through to the end. I really enjoyed it, there were some parts of the game were it got frustrating because sometimes you would be so far ahead that you know noone is going to pass you and then the AI might just put in there after burners or something and get really close to you as you about to finish a race. The story was interesting and got you thinking all the way to the end. The running from the cops was alot of fun and challenging because you have to think of different ways to drive to try and loose them. I found my self playing it for hours on end to level up my rank in game and to get more money so i can get better cars. Some times the gameplay felt repetitive, like you were going down the same roads as before over and over but alot of times they mixed the route up. If you love running from the cops in highway and rural areas then get this game.			",3024,1130,139,313,428,33,475

												Those other people dont know what they are talking about. I believe that the developers at EA and BlackBox have outdone themselves once again to bring enjoyment to the racing game scene. I understand there are other racing sims out there but none like the Need For Speed Franchise. I have owned every version since the beginning of the franchise. I own it for both PC and PS3. EA and everyone else that was involved in the making of the game... keep doing what you do best and that is making the Need For Speed franchise better and better every year			",888,197,17,58,56,3,87

												NFS:UC is another game in the NFS franchise, and features some pretty good police chase mechanics (evolved somewhat from NFS: Most Wanted) and some pretty high production value live action videos to set the scene, starring Maggie Q as your ""handler"", Chasey Lynn. You're going undercover by infiltrating a bunch of street racers who's obviously also up to no good. However, your ""boss"" may be up to no good herself... The cities are large, roads are wide, and there are plenty of chase-breakers as well as shortcuts and whatnot. There are 4 classes of cars, from regualr sports to superexotics, and 3 levels of upgrades for each. There are variety of races, from simple circuit to highway battle (get away from the other driver once you're in the lead), from knockout (last place is eliminated) to eliimination (crash target until he's disabled), from timed delivery (take this hot car to destination, no cops!)  to cop challenges (take out 5 cop cars then escape), there are a variety of missions to accomplish, using wide variety of cars, all over the major areas of this city. While the production values are high, and chases can get exciting, the videos come out as a bit... hokey, and the final battle is quite lame. Some of the missions are freaking impossible by game's end as the cars are driving insanely fast, almost beyond human reflexes. Graphics are decent but not spectacular as this is an older game. All in all, NFS:UC is not quite as good as the original Most Wanted, but the new mission and race types are welcomed. The subsequent iterations, such as Hot Pursuit (3) and ""The Run"" attempt to capture the magic, but you'll have to read those reviews elsewhere.			",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

												I know it says I have little time played but I have plalyed it for a long time on the PS3(Not Anymore) But I figured I'd leave a review for the hell of it...In the end I vote the game 8/10.The story is cheesy and feels like almost no work is put into it, you see scenes with cops, handling stuff... Chase Linh shooting a guy... and some gangsters, but in the game play itself all you have is driving, most of what the player does doesn't feel connected to the scenes/story line.My goal each time I have played was to complete the lame story ASAP to unlock the map, tracks, cars, etc..Those are the best aspects of the game. You get all the good vinyl cusomiztions from older games like NFS Carbon.You get an extensive car list, featuring EU, Japan, and American models.The track and world is the largest map(I have seen in a NFS Title) - and I've played every NFS since HP II on PS2. You have your standard freeroam, and cop chases like the  old Carbon and Most Wanted did.There is a huge selection of tracks and game modes, like High Way Battle where you struggle to gain 1000 feet ahead of the other car, while avoiding HUGE levels of traffic(comparing traffic to other NFS games). My personal favorite track is ""East I-85"" its the best track for me because it's an all interstate course, and you can really test the handling and top speed of cars. Next I will discuss the handling and driving, it is not bad, it is different from other NFS games. You can do more realistic moves with your cars than in other games, but some times the handling is overkill, put max parts on a high end car, you can catch yourself turning, then snapping into an object as if the object were attracting you. It's easier to drive if you don't hold it left or right for too long, or use nos while turning. Next I will discuss the glitches, there is lots of them. I've plalyed online matches where players could, on some tracks, exploit the driving engine and launch over clear barriers(and basically access a online-like freeroam)There is also this god-awful(but halarious) falling glitch, where you begin a race and upon starting you fall in the ground, stuck at 460mph(rounded that up), and the car doesn't reset. This glitch happens randomly and you basically have to wait to loe or quit :PThere is other glitches... I turned too hard eon time using the Audi R8?(Le Mans?, forgot) and hit an object, bounced several hundred meters in the air doing almost endless flips. You can also reset your car during freeroam and quickly drive inside a civilian car before your car becomes solid, then pause, swap cars, and you can twitch, flip, and do odd stunts involving yourself and your little civilian :DI made a semi truck literally bounce away doing that one. The glitches are fun, helps make up for the bad textures and story.Yeah the sky textures, and ground textures aren't great. The ground almost seems yellow, yellow concrete... ew.The car details are great, and that's probably the best part. Then we have the music. It's what you expect from any EA game, you get a random list of songs(that were popular when what ever game was released). Rock, Rap, and some Techno stuff, similar to MW 05 song list and Burnout 3.8/10 game, would launch the semi again. ",18,1,1,1,0,0,1

												In this game it looks like the computer is driving the car instead of me, i just have to stay on gas pedal from start to finish, and sometimes turn my wheel a bit when some corner is in front of me. In some races with less corners it's also possible to stay on the top speed limiter all the time. Accelerating in corvette z06 from 0-375 kph in less than 5 seconds is not impossible.

												Do not bother with steam version. I do not recommend this game on steam due to technical reasons.This appears to be the case for all EA racing games.First of all, the racing wheel I have does not work in the game.Secondly, when I enter menu of any type, the down arrow key locks and I cannot control the menu, what to select.Tuning your cars is a pain in the a$$ - to take the slider from 0 to 100 or left to right is a nightmare.The game itself, as a part of NFS series is decent - that is not the issue.Its just the aforementioned technical difficulties.

												Performance-wise, this runs great. Even on an older gaming laptop I don't have any problems. It loads every time, and it has never quit or froze.However, theres the gameplay. I know this game is older and doesn't have the features of today, but it still has issues that are annoying. So, age and all that aside, this is what I think. PROS:-Great car selection-Cars sound amazing-Decent music-It has an E46 M3CONS:-AI can be...special-Rubberbanding is off the charts-Traffic is horrendus, almost like they purposefully run into you -AI racers make nothing of the traffic cars, they can easily manuver them and are like a feather when hit. If you hit ONE car, you can kiss that race good bye, especially during highway battles-Story is as barebones as it gets-Car handling is horrendus-Progression takes forever. It feels like a cutscene every hour. You race a bunch of races, watch a 10 second video, do a million more racesThis game is great to jump into and race a few times, and then come back to it. It's not really a game to play for a few hours, or else it gets kinda boring.			",35,6,3,3,6,1,9

												It's pretty bad. It is poor as a technical achievement. It drops in framerate even on a card that can run many modern games at very high settings. Bad graphics, except for the car models. Story is non-sensical. I would have thought it is a better game than the PS2/Wii version, but I was wrong. The Wii version is the best version of this game.

												I have to start with; this game is a lot of fun, like hella fun, totally worth $10. This game has no story, there's no point even pretending that it has any substance, but that's not a bad thing. There isn't plot development outside of the UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENCES and the characters are laughable. It only serves as plot-points to give you free cars. The car selection is broad and the cars feel unique for the most part. Upgrading in tiers is rewarding enough and you can feel how much potentials cars have when you first unlock/buy them.The races are just regular races, be fast, hit the apex, win. The AI can be a little funny sometimes with it's speeds, but the game will sometimes straight up cheat speed to make you feel the pressure to win. I remember the lack of pressure to win in NFS:UG1&2 where you can easily lead the last races by over a 10 second margin. So that's nice. The only real issue with this game is the police AI. Helicopters can see you in tunnels, and out of line of sight and the GTR cops have x-ray vision and always know where you are which creates a mini-game of finding the pursuit breakers and cooldown spots. However this is ""gameplay feature"" is really frustrating sometimes. Multiplayer aspect of this game is nonexistent.Conclusion:This game is really fun as just a brain-dead racer with some free roam, nothing else to it. Going in with any expectations above that and you've played into EA's hand.			",92,13,2,19,20,4,8

												I really like this game as I had played it when I had a PS2 console and fully completed that version. However I would really appreciate it if this game had full controller support. As there isn't an option to set keys or certain functions are still on a few keys on my computer's keyboard. I can accelerate, brake, change view, access events, and steer in the game. But as for handbrake, nitrous and speedbreaker. Those functions aren't seemed to be on my Xbox 360 controller.Please fix the controller functions to full controller support. I recommended this game because as I said before. I had completed it on the PS2 console. And everything on that version really was playable and enjoyable. But as for this version, I'm neutral.

												Spend your money on a better racing game. I had to go into my registry and look for the key to unlock the game on Origin because the Steam version really suffers. I finished the game on Origin, that's why my time played isn't accurate.I don't understand the positive reviews mentioning a good plot. All you get are heavily compressed videos of Maggie Q having to say some dumb things and muscular men looking all angry at the camera.The driving is quite bad. If you're not able to take a corner you have to release the gas for one second so the car turns like a charm even while driving at 200+ km/h. It's just not fun and there is barely any challenge in the game.It's a consoleport and it feels like one. The graphics look way better in the screenshots and there are lot's of framedrops, especially when taking sharp turns. There is way too much bloom and if you turn it off the game looks worse thatn NFS Hot pursuit 2 (the old one). There is a nice smoke effect however when driving through sand or braking.

												Need for Speed Undercover! Where should I start with this?Let's see: First off the graphics are horrible. I set everything to the highest settings and yet the game looks like crap. Even Nfsu and nfsu2 has way better graphics than this game and they came out way before. Even Nfs carbon graphics are better than this game.Second the gameplay is nothing similar to other nfs games. You can have the fastest car in the game and the slowest car can catch up to you like its a piece of cake. I'd like to see that in real life. Have a Nissan Skyline GTR r34 fully tuned race against a 240sx fully tuned and see who wins.If you're the person who does't care about graphics and gameplays then this is for you. If you're the person who goes after well design graphics and a good gameplay then I don't recommend this for you, but try it as you may.			",117,7,5,18,2,2,2

												I would've recommended this game if there wasn't something missing...Oh, yeah. The Challenge Series DLC. Can't get it anymore or, if you can, it's Origin-exclusive.Other than that, the plot's decent, car roster's small but great, and you'll get a challenge out of some the races. The Master Events in particular. Still don't recommend it due to the missing Challenge Series, which gives more than what multiple playthroughs could ever hope to. Therefore, the 2-3 Bonus cars you get from it to use in Career Mode are (probably) forever out of grasp.			",40,3,2,10,1,0,2

												This is one of the worst ports I've ever experienced; only bested by the Tomb Raider 1 port. IN SHORT: its ugly and plays badly. I've clocked some serious time on and offline on the console counterpart and wow. It's bad.The controls for a start: in the menu, I was forced to use mouse control which kept skewing out randomly. I managed to put on the controller which annoyingly has to be done inside the menus; a bad thing in any game imo. when I got the controller on just wtf. The keys had been mapped to some random nonsense. And by that I mean even the pause button was out of whack, and I was using a 360 controller. I did remap them but just wtf. To remap them I had to revert ot kb+m to navigate the menus because I had no idea how to with the controller. Worked after this though but I have no idea why you would play it.The game first loaded in 640x480... yeah... I have 2 monitors so I caused a big shift in windows placement and sizes and to make matters worse, the game starts with an un-skip-able cinematic which blends you into the game. So I was stuck watching this hideous quality game thinking when it finally lets me start, I can sort that. Nope. I maxed the settings and its hideous, I would genuinely take teh PS3 game over this and indeed only bought this because I had played and completed the console version repeatedly way back when.As a game this is unspectacular in its prime but theres certainly fun to be had. However, its a poor port and looks terrible as well as feels worse than the console counterpart. I'm not sure if this is just me or what but its definately made this a waste fo money. I have a 3570k and a overclocked gtx 680 so I didnt expect it to look that bad for its age. Maybe its just my unrealistic expectations due to hindsight making me remember a prettier game but thats rarely the case.			",178,14,3,5,5,2,7

												I've played a lot of NFS games, but this one was by far my least favorite. The car controlled better when I used the keyboard than when I used my Afterglow Xbox controller and I felt like I had stepped back to the nintendo 64. I loved the N64 and would never say it was a bad system but this game was released in 2008 and honestly could have looked/worked a lot better. I personally think that we are better than simply pushing tab to go to the next race (the races are rediculously easy to win, there's no challenge at all). For now I can't recomend this game for what it should be. Maybe I missed something. I'm going to go back and play some more at a later time. but unless the game becomes more interesting I can't recomend it.			",34,8,5,3,3,0,4

												Ahem... Need for Speed, a reputable racing game genre that everyone should be familiar with, especially after Underground appeared on the roadmap. So why do I ask, is this abomination under the NFS banner? This is a pure stinker of a game that will have you screaming in rage at either three things:1. Akward controls - Get ready to smash your controller that the game doesn't support natively.2. Rubberbanding A.I - What is this? The god damn 90's? Please, I don't need to be reminded that one mistake costs me that 10 minute race I was close to WINNING.3. Graphics - If someone pooped on your eyes, then smeared the tears of slaves into it, that's what you get, I'm sorry, Most Wanted had the best graphics and even that wasn't awesome for todays standard.Avoid, get Most Wanted or Hot Persuit or something, avoid like the god damn plague.

												Even with the settings maxed, this game looks and feels lifeless. The story is complete fluff and the cutscenes add no real value and come across as the worst softcore porn film ever.If you're looking for customization options on par with Underground, OG Most Wanted or even Hot Pursuit Reboot, you won't find it here. Skill points are devied randomly, with bonuses given during certain events that you cannot allocate points towards.The A.I. is non-adjustable and some of the easiest I've encountered in a game yet. Police stop chasing you heavily after a minute or so. The other racers are a joke as well. 30 second split times? Gimme a break...I might revisit this game later down the line, but so far, I'm not terribly impressed. At least it's playable, compared to The Shift series and The Run.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game does not follow the real world's physics law at all. I am driving at least 20 to 30 km/h faster than an opponent (judging by the speed and time I am passing the opponent's car, in a way that if you are driving 20 km/h faster than the opponent's car, you are driving 5.5m/second faster than an opponent. This means, if you are literally tailgating the opponent, it takes 1 second to be a little ahead of the opponent and in a 2 second, you pass the opponent completely, and there are at least 2 to 3 meters between your car and your oppoent. And, lets think about how fast a car can accelerate. from 0 to 60 miles, or 0 to 100 km, an average car in the game (excluding cars like Bugatti Veyron) it takes about 2 to 3 seconds at least to reach 0 to 60 miles, or 0 to 100 km. Now, if a car is around or above 160 km/h or 100mi/h, it takes significantly more time to accelerate.. And guess what, my car passes an oppoent, gains some distance which is not at all achievable to reduce in a short period of time (meaning several minutes), and the opponent reduces that distance in no time like 10 to 20 seconds, and at maximum within a minute. This is just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Even if I am giving a consideration to the fact that it is a mere game, this is not something to be messed around. The fact that this game is released several years ago will be the only reason I will be accepting the fact the way it is, but this game does not in any way gives the way the cars are raced, nor how a car can catch up another car. Only the fact that it is a ""game"" will give an immunity to this product of failing such significant factor of actual racings.			",8,0,0,1,4,0,2

												Cons:30FPS lockMax resolution 4:3 1024x768, 16:9 1280x720 (720p)Low textures (like very bad and dull textures, even NFSU2 look better than this), those screenshot are lies.Over-glare effect to cover dull world in high setting, and no I cannot turn that shining light of sun without turn it off whole effect entirely.EA Nation login, which is non exist todaycausing No Multiplayer.it doesn't scale very well with new hardware.Pros:Cut-scene is great, I like Maggie QSound/Music overall shine over the gameplay.Other Thoughts:I just want to replay my old NFS games, but I'm not sure which titled, so I end up with this one.I don't feel so bad about it, because 78% discount.I feel like this cut-scene cost more than developing budget.I'm still curious which NFS title that I want to replay, it's probably Hot Pursuit, I should get that one instead of this. just forget this and move on.EDIT: it's NFS CARBON, I should get that instead, but I can't find it anywhere.

												Even with the settings maxed, this game looks and feels lifeless. The story is complete fluff and the cutscenes add no real value and come across as the worst softcore porn film ever.If you're looking for customization options on par with Underground, OG Most Wanted or even Hot Pursuit Reboot, you won't find it here. Skill points are devied randomly, with bonuses given during certain events that you cannot allocate points towards.The A.I. is non-adjustable and some of the easiest I've encountered in a game yet. Police stop chasing you heavily after a minute or so. The other racers are a joke as well. 30 second split times? Gimme a break...I might revisit this game later down the line, but so far, I'm not terribly impressed. At least it's playable, compared to The Shift series and The Run.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This title is everything wrong with the EA cashgrab machine. The actual game is quite fun; on console. On PC, however, they clearly couldn't be bothered to fix something as simple as the graphics resetting to minimum every time the game starts.That's right, every time you fire up Undercover, the graphics will be at their absolute minimum in all their blurry, chunky 600x400 glory. Which means you will spend the first 10 minutes of your playtime navigating through all the graphics menus with your keyboard (because mouse support is overrated), and re-selecting the maximum settings you had before.The sad thing is, even on maximum settings, the game doesn't look good. I get that it is quite dated at this point, but somehow in my memories of playing this game on my friend's 360 console, the game looked way better.At any rate, it is a discount arcade racer that EA slapped a PC release label on, and once again didn't bother to actually port settings correctly. Don't waste your money.			",38,4,3,11,3,0,6

												I have to start with; this game is a lot of fun, like hella fun, totally worth $10. This game has no story, there's no point even pretending that it has any substance, but that's not a bad thing. There isn't plot development outside of the UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENCES and the characters are laughable. It only serves as plot-points to give you free cars. The car selection is broad and the cars feel unique for the most part. Upgrading in tiers is rewarding enough and you can feel how much potentials cars have when you first unlock/buy them.The races are just regular races, be fast, hit the apex, win. The AI can be a little funny sometimes with it's speeds, but the game will sometimes straight up cheat speed to make you feel the pressure to win. I remember the lack of pressure to win in NFS:UG1&2 where you can easily lead the last races by over a 10 second margin. So that's nice. The only real issue with this game is the police AI. Helicopters can see you in tunnels, and out of line of sight and the GTR cops have x-ray vision and always know where you are which creates a mini-game of finding the pursuit breakers and cooldown spots. However this is ""gameplay feature"" is really frustrating sometimes. Multiplayer aspect of this game is nonexistent.Conclusion:This game is really fun as just a brain-dead racer with some free roam, nothing else to it. Going in with any expectations above that and you've played into EA's hand.			",92,13,2,19,20,4,8

												I really like this game as I had played it when I had a PS2 console and fully completed that version. However I would really appreciate it if this game had full controller support. As there isn't an option to set keys or certain functions are still on a few keys on my computer's keyboard. I can accelerate, brake, change view, access events, and steer in the game. But as for handbrake, nitrous and speedbreaker. Those functions aren't seemed to be on my Xbox 360 controller.Please fix the controller functions to full controller support. I recommended this game because as I said before. I had completed it on the PS2 console. And everything on that version really was playable and enjoyable. But as for this version, I'm neutral.

And just because of this game I have no expectations whatsoever for NFS The Run (but that's mainly because it will created by the same developer). Let Criterion Games handle the next action packed NFS games please, they know what to do. Back to hell with you, Undercover ![Rating: 59/100]			",1655,629,69,221,194,16,225

												I've been playing this a bit, and I have to admit, I'm very disapointed, the traillers for this game made it look really good, but really, the game isn't that good. This is not the Need For Speed I know. I'm not impressed at where the story line goes or the fact that it just dumps you into the middle of a map, with no real objective. The graphics arn't much of an improvment from Most Wanted, and to tell you the truth, I think Most Wanted has beter graphics than this game does. We are talking 3 years difference, and not much improvment, plus the camera movement is annoying. That's really all I have to say about this game. Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit looks a lot better than this game.			",136,14,11,7,8,1,12

												Don't even know how this ended up in my library, probably with a bundle?I generally like the NFS series and accept their disrespect of physics (my favorite was the first Most Wanted) but as of 2015, this game is a damn waste of time. Do yourself a favor and avoid it.WORSE: it installs PunkBuster and does NOT remove it when you uninstall the game.The thing stays active and even attempts to connect to the internet, with no record in the Programs&Features panel.

												Utterly broken.Neither my Steam controller nor my Xbox One controller would work with this game. Strangely, they both work in NFS Carbon and NFS Most Wanted.... Older games in the series by the same dev??Graphics are terrible and also buggy. Car effects on Off, they look fine but you don't get lights on police cars. Car effects on, regardless of setting (low/med/hi) everything has a reflection on it that is on 90% of the time but disappears, reappears and flickers with no rhyme or reason.Bad UI, bad controls, Steam overlay doesn't work in normal mode nor Big Picture (meaning you can't adjust your steam controller to work as a keyboard, seemingly the only way around the broken gamepad support). Just avoid this and go get Underground 2 or Most Wanted and get a 1080p patch for them.			",406,55,37,35,33,6,44

												     Before I start this review, I will say that I am actually very fond of the Need For Speed games, atleast most of them, with Most Wanted 2005 being my absolute favorite. This game, however, does not come close.     I have played this game on Xbox360, PS2, and Pc now. The Xbox360 version was very good and I enjoyed it a lot. That one gets a 7/10. The Ps2 version was decent, but lacked a lot of the story and had very few cars. 6/10. This one, however, was ported HORRIBLY. It feels like it ported straight from the XBOX360(With much worse graphics) with about 5 minutes of tweeking. AND THE CONTROLS ARE SOME OF THE WORSE I HAVE EVER SEEN. I tried to use this with the controller and keyboard and both were tedious. The controller only is able to function with half of the game and the keyboard is utterly the most confusing set-up i have ever seen. I mean seriously? Delete was my nitrous button! I couldnt even customize my cars and had to get away with whatever they happened to give me.     The game crashes ALL THE TIME. for the hour and a half I was playing it crashed 4 times, twice while I was racing, and twice during a cutscene. I have a top-knotch rig, so it is definitley the game's fault here.     That and some other problems like blinding sun blare, jerky movement of the car, limited multiplayer, the only problem I couldn't find was what most people shun this game for: Rubber-banding AI. The only redeeming thing about this game is play-time(7-8 hours, which is fine), the customization(If you can find it) and the car list which was actually fairly large for an arcade racer.     My final rating is a solid 3/10. its a bad game port and I certainly don't recommend it. C'mon EA, you know better than this...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is one of the worst of the series. I'm not sure what the coders were thinkling, but here are my complaints in tl;dr form.1) Your car doesn't matter, the AI will always scale to you.2) Your driving doesn't matter, the AI will always find a way to match you.3) Your skill doesn't matter when the AI can match you.4) Random physics breaks.When you're doing 185 in a Porsche with nitro and a racer from 10sec behind you passes you with breaklights... It gets annoying. Cars randomly spin out, AI traffic decides to take you out, everything is mismatched and unbalanced. This game is tedious and annoying to say the leas t, not much in the way of redeeming unless you justy casually drive around the map (which is mostlyt limited to highway travel anyways). Don't waste your cash, don't get it full price. If you really want it I would just wait for a humble bundle./end rant.Otherwise, love the series.			",89,5,0,9,17,0,7

												Game breaking crash to desktop when you try and start the ""Transporter"" mission prevents you from playing the second and third part of the game.No unlocked resolution support: If your monitor's native res isn't on the list, you're out of luck because you can't mod the game or any of it's files to fix it. At least it calculates the aspect ratio from your desktop resolution so if you don't mind stretching the pixels the ratio in-game will at least be correct. However, the cutscenes and HUD will be stretched.			",173,21,9,20,10,3,9

Graphics are amazing by the time of it's release, The menu it's just so horrible I reallly got to hate pressing the ESC key.The visuals for this one are so limited and not really that cool looking.Music is a subjective matter but I gotta say I really didn't enjoy most of it.The AI is just so bad, not really that ""Intelligent"".Hitbox problems.Know that when you lightly touch a wall you can get hit and crash as if you were facing it.

												This game in particular has given me mixed feelings. When I first bought the game and played the earlier mission, I had a blast. The game was pretty fun, but the fun never lasted. When I was progressing later in the game, the AI seems almost impossible to beat and I got fed up. The scenery soon became repetitive and boring and the races became harder than my erect ding dong. I quit, never bothered to finish the game. Besides, the cars handled like sh*t anyway.In a nutshell, this game is like the wh*re of all NFSs. The game was fun for awhile, then it became an utter pain in the a** to play. Just like that wh*re of a girlfriend that turns you on for a few weeks, then dumps you for a better weiner.

There are numerous other racing games on the market for a little more money.  The game is much like any other Need for Speed title and the cutscenes become extremely tedious after the first playthrough.  Support for more recent versions of OS is also failing as the game tends to crash often.			",130,13,2,8,10,2,39

												I recommend playing NFS Most Wanted or NFS Hot Persuit instead of this one if you are a ""Imma go back and finish my old games"" type of gamer. While the most important thing in a NFS game is the driving, which this game does well, the environment and stoy both fall flat. If you've played Most Wanted and Hot Persuit then you know what I mean.1 hour into the game and I already lost interest in playing it. You can play through this game once but that's pretty much it.

												Terrible game mechanics, it runs jerky as crap with a system well beyond its recommended settings. It's slightly less jerky than the PS3 version.If there is any version worth checking out of NFS: Undercover it is the Sony PlayStation Portable (PSP). Its by far the best iteration to play and still not saying much.I'm a huge fan of the early series but rather dissapointed in these later releases starting with anything after the first Most Wanted Black version. Have yet to play the Shift series with is supposed to be more simulation like.			",212,8,9,6,1,1,0

												Bought it as a bundle for cheap so i'm not complaining much, however this game is poorly coded to the point where you may aswell buy a different game.Being an old game, it may not be badly coded but it isnt well compatable.Also being an old game, at £9.99 it's worth it if you have Windows XP / Vista I guess.But here's what happened:- First time I launched it, it went to 640x480 and crashed my pc with a black screen.- Second time, changed resolution to 1920x1080 and it crashed.- Third time, it launched it 1920x1080 and played for an hour or so finishing alot of missions and obtaining different cars along the way for it to suddenly crash as I merely evade the police.Pros:- Nice cars.- Good gameplay.- Is not half bad if you get it on a console.- Enjoyable to play when it did play.Cons:- Ugly enviroment.- Poor brakes.- Easy AI.- Cars too slow.- Use of KM/H.- Annoying real life based cut scenes.- Stupid police chatter.- Unrealistic police chases.- Unrealistic police cars.- Use of blocking corners with arrows.- Glitches with autosculpt. (Make a custom bumper for it to erase itself.)- Unrealistic traffic.- Weird gravity.- Any form of air requires a slow-mo replay apparently.- Buildings out of proportion.- No ingame brightness/gamma options, makes you change your tv.- Screenshots need an origin account?

YOU CAN'T SKIP THE CUT SCENES...AND WHAT IS UP WITH THE LIVE VIDEO CUT SCENES? Lastly, playing on a controller is a joke unless you map it out in a script, default control for acceleration is X button? Why not use R trigger like everyone else?

												It's a decent game, took me 10 hours to complete. I would say that it's one of the worst NFS games though. The driving is really neat, but the police chases are boring compared to Most Wanted. You start of with a good car, then it falls of after a while. Then you get a new car, which is very powerful, but then that falls of as well. You constantly have to upgrade your car, or the AI will crush you.The storyline is flat, no real surprises, and the ending was expected.

												This won't even run on my Windows 7 x64 machine.i7 4790k, 16gb of ram, SSD's, Rx 480 8gb.I understand this is an old game and I used to love it on my core 2 duo - with Windows 7 mind you... but it does not run.I managed to run it from an administrator command prompt but it bombs while loading the saved-game even if I made a new one.  I am out of ideas.  Tried the newer game - a remake of Hot pursuit, used to love that from almost 20 years ago, and gosh I must say this company shouldn't be allowed to make games anymore.Sorry, but AI scaling to the player just shuts off all the fun.  I threw out Flatout series for that, and after this experience and the one with the new Hot Pursuit, I am pretty done with EA.  You can take your scripted AI-that-always-keeps-up and your broken games and keep them to yourself!  This coming from someone who absolutely, positively LOVED the first 4 of the series starting with The Need For Speed back in MS-DOS in 95~96.I really don't like being pestered to LOG IN to EVERYTHING.  I am disabled, I can't remember passwords, and in America, you can't leave your passwords written down if your a PC user or the identity thieving police informants will steal it.EA, you are everything that is wrong with PC gaming.

												 I bought this game, having played the outstanding 2012 most wanted. I thought it would be just as impressive. it wasn't. the police pursuits are short and boring, the money system is broken and the graphics are awful considering this is labelled as a 2013 game( although it was made in 2008). the trailers are a lie: you do not have a big task, you just compete in boring races. the mechanics are awful. if you want to waste 10 pounds on this game then go ahead, but be warned: its not what you think it is!

												+ is good- Is bad= Both?This game is generally an okay racing game.It is on the lower spectrum of the NFS series (But they are all really good games)I'll go through some good and bad. I may be a little knit picky about some of these but they just really get to me and maybe a good amount of you.But there is 1 major flaw that makes this game horrible and fills me with anger every time I see it. And it is quite common+The racing is fun when you have compeition. You want to win. +The cars have pretty good handeling. The are nice to drive.=The story you will understand and will sometimes pick up, but most won't really care and will just get into the racing.=The map is large and sometimes is okay to roam around in, but you don't get a feeling of exploration and wanting to travel the map like other NFS games made me feel. No sense of adventure-You are fined WAY too much. You lose money for many things. It gets annoying.-The soundtrack in my opinion is GOD AWFUL. It only fits to 2 music genres, Country and Hard Rock. If you don't like these genres sometimes it is hard to play hearing it in the background and the music is very unfitting at times. When I am in a tight position with a rival car racing close to the finish, the music plays a soft country tune. I don't like either genres so it feels bad to hear. Annoying.-You LOSER MONEY for SPEEDING. This game is Need For Speed. You are ment to go fast. I know it is against the ""laws"" in the game but you get fined for going fast and having fun. Speed is one of the soul points of the game. You get fined during races for speeding, too. I get so angry whenever I see that red light flash of SPEEDING -250. Other than thisd major flaw it is an overall decent racing game. Although I do not reccomend the game it is fun to try out and I suggest you buy it on sale. I got it for $2, so I won't be so harsh on it. But if you want a decent racer, play this if it is on sale.			",72,1,3,0,7,1,6

												This game is GARBAGE.  Launching it drags you through several minutes of unskippable intro videos before putting you in control of a vehicle, all before giving you any opportunity whatsoever to adjust screen resolution, volume, etc.  In my case, the game crashed repeatedly at the end of the first sequence.  Restarting it multiple times and having to sit through the same garbage intro every time was painful.   Once you're finally able to adjust the game's settings, you'll no doubt find that it doesn't support the most common video resolutions, there is no way to adjust the wonky control scheme, and regardless of how you setup your controls you still get keyboard prompts for everything (press _tab_ to enter a race!).  The game is a hot mess and it's no wonder that Black Box is defunct.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												NFS Undercover is maybe the most casual, plain and simple game of all serial. To call it arcade... well, I remember arcades of 80's, so it is definitely not an arcade! It is very sub-arcade, in the terms of controls and the whole gameplay.Yet I'm not so determined to absolutely NOT recommending that game. You see, that depends from where you are looking at the whole NFS bunch of games. If you are one with NFS Underground, you maybe found Undercover less colourful, but acceptable. Same goes with the fans preferring NFS Underground 2 the most. Now, the biggest group of fans, I know, love the Most Wanted. For them, Undercover will be quite bleak in terms of contest. The police there dumb and slooow, the contenders, for the most time, also not showing you any challenge.Undercover has its own nice features, sure.First, the soundtrack. It's the best from the whole serial, I still have more than dozen tracks from there in my playlist.Second, the cars. There are quite a bunch of roaring road monsters for every taste, with the only downside that you should invest some time in the game to get to the sweetest ones.Third, Maggie Q. I'm not a fan of her, yet she certainly make the atmosphere a little less boring.Still, it is not enough for me. You see, my favourite NFS is Porshe Unleashed, so I can certainly tell you from my biased point of view, that all driving in the Undercover is boring as Mr.Obama speeches. The physics of driving is under every level of comparison. Maybe it is similar to the driving in the Watch Dogs, but hardly better. I've played Undercover on the PSP platform, but even there I was not really engaged in the races. They were not attractive even on that tiny piece of hardware, and PSP is not rich with the racing games at all!So, the only good thing I believe you can get from buying Undercover now is the little fraction of the same drive that gathered NFS so many fans with Underground and Most Wanted titles. So far you can't buy any of those great games on Steam, maybe you'll get desperate enough and go with the Undercover.My mark is 5.8/10. If you try to look a little harder, you'll find so many better racing games on Steam, than that. Yeah, they won't be calling Need For Speed, so what?			",725,237,45,155,101,5,232

												Need for Speed: Undercover retains all bad qualities of previous NFS titles while abolishing everything that made NFS titles worth playing. The ♥♥♥♥ing awful cut-scenes are there, the hilariously ridiculous cars are all accounted for, and the god awful storyline is present as well. What’s missing is everything else, customization is severely lacking and unique/accurate car controls are missing. You can drive a Lamborghini and hit top speed with nitro, but a ♥♥♥♥ing Mercedes will still pass you. That’s how ridiculous the logic is in this game. This issue isn’t much of a problem early game, but in the endgame you will most certainly lose every race because every A.I. has hacks that can beat your top speed with any car. This game is a “Most Wanted” wannabe and is an insult to the NFS series.			",2378,1002,91,291,305,24,411

												A game that attempted to be Most Wanted, but failed in nearly every regard.It apes MW with an uncanny level of dedication, but somehow misses the fun-factor of MW.Autosculpt is fun as always, the selection of cars is wonderful, graphics are decent, and music is fairly good.The engine runs inexplicably heavy on hardware far above the recommended and always feels janky and imprecise.Get it on a steep sale if you're itching for something that feels close to MW.

												I purchased NFS Undercover last week, and until there is a patch it is unplayable. When the opening screen starts, there are small words at the top for Menu and Options, but I am unable to click on them! I have a wonderful Logitech G27 Steering wheel, but the game refuses to recognize it since I am blocked from access to the Options screen for setting it up! I am sure that once it is patched it will be very fun to play, but as of December 1, 2013 I find it to be dead in the water!Groan!			",31,1,5,1,2,0,5

												Chase or Be Chased.You never thought it would turn out like this—an all-out chase where you're the hunted. And the hunter. Now you must get behind the wheel and risk everything to infiltrate a ruthless international crime syndicate and take them down. The man you're after is a maniac behind the wheel, and he's driving like his life depends on escape, which maybe it does. He's the one with all the answers you need, you will track him down. Needless to say, that fleet of police cruisers in your rearview mirror won't make things any easier. It will take all of your experience—and every ounce of skill—to outrun the law, take down the enemy, and unlock the truth that puts an end to this chase once and for all.- Go Deep Undercover - Race into an action-packed story of pursuit and betrayal. Take on jobs and compete in races to prove yourself as you infiltrate and take down an international crime syndicate.- Highway Battle - Fight off the cops and others as you take down your prey in high-speed, high stake multi-car chases. New and vastly improved AI mechanics mean more aggressive and intelligent cops focused on taking you out fast and by any means necessary.- Own the Open World - Tear across the massive highway system and discover the open world of the Gulf Coast Tri-Cities area, with three unique cities connected by an extensive highway system.- Heroic Driving Engine - An all-new game engine lets you pull off amazing moves for the ultimate driving edge.

NEED FOR SPEED: UNDERCOVEROr how I'd like to call it: NEED FOR SPEED: UNDERDEVELOPED.No, seriously, this game is objectively a disaster. Horrible handling and physics engine; Horrible optimization; HUGE difficulty spike; brain dead AI; frustrating UI for visual tuning; pointless open world and a completly dumb and forgettable story.This is the whole package of the game. And the worst part about this? The Steam-version is the unpatched version of the game! If you are thinking: ""Well the patched version fixes all of the issues you listed"" Then I have to dissapoint you, cause it doesn't fix the issues.Story:In short, you are an undercover agent who's task is to take down car smuglers / criminals while your partner (I forgot her name, i guess it's Chase Lin or something) ""helps"" you getting inside the criminal's gangs or more like: She doesn't do anything gameplaywise. How do you take them down? Well you have to BE a street racer kill hundreds of innocent cops and destroy the city. You don't do anything else ""Cop-related"" besides the takedown missions, in which case you just have to ram the vehicle untill it's destroyed. You don't have access to back up or anything else and I guarentee you that you will even forget that you are an undercover agent. It would've make more sense if you were a street racer right from the start, getting caught by the police and then being tasked to take down those criminals for you not to land in jail. There are also unnecessary ""Plot-Twists"", but I'm not going to spoil them.Driving:Like I said, the handling feels completly out of place. The cars feel like they have no weight (You'll quickly notice that if you try to ram your opponnents) and you either turn unnaturaly fast and slam into the wall, or your car won't turn at all.In addition to the handling the physics of the game make everything worse. Later on in the game, your car is going to constantly jump at crucial curves in which case you will always slam against the wall and loose most of your speed and getting taken over by the opponnents, since they can turn 90° at 250-300 km/h. That's right, the enemy AI (Not cops included) have one of the weirdest rubber band effects you will ever come across. They will mostly be on your tail and drive almost flawelessy with redicilous handling and they will require you to drive perfectly. Using the ideal line most of the time and not even strafing the wall, since you loose around 20 km/h and you can't steer for a second. And you will also be at the mercy of the AI, hoping they crash somewhere so you have some breathing air.Races:The only type of races you get are:SprintCircuitCheckpointOutrun (1 v 1 Races in the open world, be the first one for a specific time)and Highway Battles (Thats where you are at the mercy of the AI the most, if you try to dominate the races)There are also Cop Chases but they are neither fun, not challenging or anything else. It feels completly tagged on and I think it's even possible to complete the story without doing any of those.Performance:It doesn't matter if you have the latest hardware, the game will always have performance issues. I have a ASUS GTX 1060 Strix OC 6GB, 8gb RAM, and an FX 8350 and the game still gets at around 10 fps at specific points and in combination with the incredible speed, the game becomes unplayable at times.Difficulty Spike:This is one of the biggest issues of the game. At the start, the game becomes super easy and you will outrun your opponnents with ease. Later on, in order to even win a race, you have to dominate it with 10-30 secs faster then the expected time for that. If you don't know what I mean with ""dominating"", it's basically a time limit you get to complete a race, it's like an extra challenge ontop of winning the race.Another example: The game has a challenge series similar to Most Wanted etc. where you are given a specific car and task to do in order to complete it. Now imagine you are given a BMW M3 with max speed of 314 km/h and you have to race a Porsche Carrera GT in a Highway battle. You know what happened? I lost multiple times after 20-30 seconds passed since the race started because the opponnent just outran me, eventhough I was at max speed the whole time and didn't crash once. And you can't switch the car, since it is given to you for that ""challenge"". You just basically have to hope that the opponnent's car is going to crash in order for you to even have a chance to win.I could go on with the issues, but I won't, since the character limit will prevent that.If you can look past those flaws and have fun with the game, then it's good for you.But if you think, that this game is objecively a good game, then you are free to provide counter arguments.Otherwise:Don't even bother with this game.

												Fantastic. Exactly what I'd expect from Need for Speed. The speed, the cop chase, the car modification, the plot, graphic, engine sounds, everything, just simply satisfying. Just keep in mind that this game is not meant to simulate real racing, so you don't find it strange when your car is absolutely indestructible.One problem I'm having is that, since I'm not a native speaker of English, I can't really understand the story because they speak too unclearly and THERE'S NO SUBTITLE. Add that and this game will become perfect.+ the need for speed+ cops are dumb (yeah it's good)+ car modification+ open world+ story+ Maggie Q- no subtitle- races at the same level vary too much in difficulty9 out of 10, marvelous.

												I have played various Need for Speed games over the years and they have all had at their core a very solid enjoyable racing experience and this is no exception. You have the racing element, the police chases, the destruction, the performance tuning and of course taking some of the most beautifully designed sports cars on the road and trying to make them look as ridiculous as possible. The story is no great work of literature but it strings the races together nicely. One thing which stands out about this game is the highway duels. Street racing games generally have very light traffic to make racing possible but this has some one on one races through heavier motorway traffic that are really fun.			",128,95,10,4,4,1,8

												This is the closest thing you can get ""legitimately"" to Need For Speed: Most Wanted. You know, the first one. The one World is based upon. Most Wanted was a great game, although it had a tendency to crash during very long pursuits (~20 minutes). This gets close, although it doesn't have pursuit challenges and those were tons of fun.Play Most Wanted first. Amazon.com has a few more copies. EA doesn't sell the game anymore, so...

												I'm gonna start off with saying that this game will have its' moments where it will absolutely frustrate you beyond measure; I'm talkin' keyboard-smashing, controller-hurling frustration. And the main cause of it isn't even the challenging gameplay, though that does contribute. No no, it's the glitches. A few corners have horrible hitboxes, if I can call them that, to where you'll slam into an invisible wall during a sharp turn that'll lose you the race. Or perhaps the issue with the turning. On occasion, the left- or right- arrow keys will just decide not to work for a couple seconds, usually conveniently when you're trying to turn. You'll fly into the barrier with no reaction time, which will, again, lose you the race. Sometimes even the AI racers will spin you sideways onto their front bumper and you'll get permanently t-boned - you'll be unable to reverse or accelerate out of it, and the AI doesn't bother steering. Your only choice is to restart or quit entirely. I've had to repeat countless events because of issues like this. Of course, some of this frustration will come from the improved AI (which, let me tell you, is a big step up from previous Need for Speed games). The police units are definitely much smarter, and will attempt to spin you out, prevent you from turning so you run into a wall or spike strip, and even box you in. Quite impressive, but extremely annoying sometimes, expecially when they come in during a race and completely screw you over. Okay, that's enough cons. The pros; there is a fantastic variety of roads. Uphill, downhill, winding, long straights, banking turns, the whole shebang. They provide all the tests you would need to perfect your car, whether it be suspension or traction, top speed or acceleration. And once you've fine-tuned your vehicle, you can listen blissfully to the roaring engine down the long highways, or enjoy the view of the sexy beast you just created as you take it through the banked turns. Which brings me to my next point; the graphics. I'll admit the environment is not particularly special (the cliffs kinda look like manure piles; just collages of different shades of brown), but, as you would hope for from a racing game, the cars look fantastic, and quite accurate to their real-life equivalents. I can definitely say I've spent some time simply admiring a car I've just customized, or even one of the AI racers that caught my eye. And that brings up the customization possibilities, which might as well be infinite. Seriously. Every person in the world could play this game and be able to make a ride completely unique to everyone else's. Other than tons of spoilers and rims which can be widened, lengthened, deepened, and more, there are a couple hundred different vinyls that you can alter in size, position, color, angle, etc. to keep you busy, and a huge color panel to choose from as well. In fact, customization is probably where this game excels. The racing is sometimes questionable in terms of the physics, but definitely fun. The story is interesting I suppose, but will definitely get redundant if you wish to play it a second or third time, as I have done in order to get a variety of cars. But, despite its' faults, as you can tell by my gameplay hours, the appealing supercars and high-speed action has this game pulling me back every time.			",83,4,0,3,2,0,2

Good racing action. 2. As with all Need For Speed titles this one has a solid sound track. The Bad: 3. A bit repetitive.  Well its all about street racing isn't it? 4. Its not a new games which shows, but the action makes up for it.5. A very limited choice of cars. The Ugly: 6. Some of the cars you are forced to go on mission with are down right pathetic. 7. Some of the latter optional races are near impossible.  You can still complete the main story without winning these races. If you are looking for some enjoyable racing action look no further.

												This game is fun, although there are many bad things about it. Good news: Love the free roam. I love the selection of cars. Kinda like the story line. Bad news: Police chases get WAY out of hand. Ex: I was heat level 2 and there were like 20 cops chasing me and they were laying down spike strips and all that.   But, when you ARENT in a police chase, the spawning of the cops is so bad. I had 5 police cars behind me. IN A ROW. Also, I stop at a stoplight, like a normal driver, and a police cruiser slams into the back of me and puts his sirens on. On the radio he is saying it is my fault! That ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. Also, I found a spot in the map where NO COPS can go. I don't know how to explain it, but basically its an unfinished highway and you have to jump onto it with your car. And the police can't get up there! After that, you have evaded and all goes well. So the AI and the spawning of the 5-O in this game is kind of bad, but if the game is on sale for 3$, I'd say get the game :D			",53,6,2,6,15,0,1

												I've not experienced a title as interesting as this within Need for Speed for a long time. Where do I even begin? The endless flaws and general glitchy gameplay? The hidden charm?Let's start with the positives first:+ The smoke seems as good a place to start as any. It is gorgeous! In ProStreet, EA BlackBox (the developer) gave the tire smoke a new look and it was stunning as it wrapped around the tires in a drag race. It is the same here, with the smoke seemingly blurring your car amidst it. It even changes to brown if you're driving on dirt!+ Car selection is slightly more positive than negative I'd say. 54 cars in total with a great variety of muscle, exotic and tuner. There are no SUVs but I will never care again if they forget about SUVs entirely. They were terrible in Underground 2 lol. Each car can be upgraded (albeit with not a lot to choose from) both performance and aesthetic wise.+ Core mechanics. What I mean is the underlying gameplay, where you find the genuine fun of NFS Undercover. If you look at Undercover at the surface, you'll find something drasticly wrong with it. But scratch underneath that and you can see EA Black Box tried something a little different. The cars handle differently to any previous NFS before it, giving them an incredibly unrealistic but extremely fun feel! This is due to the ""Heroic Driving Engine"". It certainly gives the cars a slidy feel, but it's not to the point of feeling like you're driving on ice. You can do doughnuts easily, and then suddenly pull away. You can be driving at over 150 MPH and then suddenly veer off round a corner going nearly the same speed. You can pull off J-turns like nothing at all. It offers the chance to drive easily but with some flair.+ Graphical tuning. Undercover actually offers a pretty nice list of graphical fine-tuning for you to choose from. From anti-aliasing to texture filtering, adjusting the car detail to world detail, it provides some good things for you to match the game to what your computer is capable of.+ Photo Mode. I love taking photos of my cars! I've taken advantage of ""Photo Mode"" in every racing game, not just NFS however. So an inclusion in this title is no different! The graphics are... average... but they provide enough for some sweet photos.OK, I have to admit this is where the positives end.... erm... yeah, so on to the negatives I suppose.- The AI is the most FRUSTRATING, BROKEN, IDIOTIC and UNDECISIVE piece of CRAP. I have never felt so angered than I have playing Undercover. Let's start with the traffic: what traffic?! If you're driving along on your own, or in a race, it doesn't matter because the world is dead apparently. Every so often it will breathe life into a race with a car or two, but that's it. The ONLY time you'll find a busy stretch of road is during a Highway Battle. That's it. When you're in a Circuit Race, the civilian cars will randomly drive THROUGH the barriers and suddenly smash into you as they come out, or they'll drive into the barrier and get in your damn way as they turn off! When they're changing lanes, I kid you not, they LOVE to do it when you're about to pass them! They'll suddenly veer off to be in front of you, and completely screw you up! I have even found them to turn a corner and actually come off of the road... for NO viable reason. They just swerve suddenly and come off the road. It's so broken it's hilarious. And they randomly crash too! I drive over hills or around a corner, and I find a small pile up of cars, or cars that have somehow crashed into the wall... As for the bloody racers? They're just as bad. RUBBER BANDING. Why the HELL is EA still allowing this kind of crap? You had rubber banding in UNDERGROUND 1! And that is 11 years old! I could be scraping the rear end of an opponent, I make them hit a wall, I then use some Nitrous to get away, and the opponent is somehow matching my speed. I mean, how is that possible? I know NFS is not realistic in any sense of the word, but rubber banding takes the biscuit. I detest it.- Unbalanced difficulty. I guess this just relates to the AI again, but I feel this needs its own category. In a Sprint Race for e.g. I would be so far ahead of the competition that I could not even see them on the map. I didn't need to even think about them at all. And for the most part it would be like that in most races. As soon as I crash because of the poorly designed AI traffic, or my car decides to skid off the track, within seconds the opponents are closing in extremely fast! And because of the rubber banding, they can suddenly keep up with me. It's a joke. In other races, I've been struggling to even keep up with the racers in 1st or 2nd. I had a Mazda RX-7 with ""Street"" level tuning, and I struggled to keep up with a Nissan 240SX. It was endlessly overtaking then falling back again. Eventually I would win, but not without difficulty. And what about the cops? Man oh man are they strange. As soon as I slow down they go nuts! They smash into me like there is no tomorrow. But when I speed up they trail off, leaving me to wreck the joint. One more thing: when I'm literally cruising along the street in my car, and I cruise past the Police, they suddenly go after me, claiming I'm speeding or whatever. It's useless and this just proves how messed up the AI is.- Useless display of points. I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but when you perform tricks etc. you seem to rack up ""points"" for lack  of a better word. They add up, but they add up to nothing. And I can't seem to figure out why there are points in the first place. There is no tactical advantage, no bonus, no unlocks for gaining a certain amount of points. It's the same when you smash a fence or hit a car and you see some money pop up for the damage. I understand you causing the ""State"" money during a pursuit, but whilst cruising in free roam? What's the point in even having either come up?- Unbalanced tuning. Let me put it this way: My Mazda RX-7 with ""Street"" level tuning could OUTRUN a LAMBORGHINI. Lamborghini, do you even tune brah?- Most pointless story I have ever come across! Again, let me put it this way: You're a typical nameless nobody with no voice or face. You are an undercover police officer trying to worm your way in to a drug-smuggling ring of ""thugs"" (EA's terminlogy, not mine). It literally takes ONE race respectively to impress the top guys and you're suddely their new favourite pet lmao. And before you know it, within a couple of missions, you're already taking them all down by smashing their car's into a thousand pieces. Story writing at its utter worst.- Also the shortest story ever. You'll complete it I'd say in 5 - 6 hours at best. If you put in maximum effort, I'd say possibly under 5 hours. What a joke.Look, I could go on and on and on and on with this review, but the truth is, there are SO MANY NEGATIVES and things wrong with this title that I would never be able to recommend it.After everything however, I can honestly say it has heart. This is a game aimed at the most casual audience possible. This would be enjoyed by young teenagers and children. But I'm 23 years old (today lol it's my birthday!) and I want a game waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more polished and fleshed out than this. There is some fun to be had with the driving thanks to the ""H.D.E."" and it will offer something to do for a few hours, but this will quickly dissolve into boredom. EA's more recent efforts with Hot Pursuit 2010, Most Wanted 2012 (despite what people say, it's a great game) and even Rivals (amazing first effort from Ghost Games!) is enough to keep you coming back. I'm not surprised EA Black Box was wiped away as even EA stated that they were being overworked. Here's to 2015, and hoping that two years worth of development time can give us the Need for Speed we've all been waiting for.VERDICT: The police busted me for driving slower than the traffic. 5/10			",178,13,23,16,13,1,20

												The heroic driving engine is easy to use and handle - You can perform J-turns, 180 turns, 360 burnouts, and Drifting, all the elements of being a stunt driver which I find pretty useful when escaping the 5-0. Most of the missions were pretty easy except for the hot car events where you must deliver a car undamaged while escaping the 5-0 under time constraints. The Customisations were good too but very limited. The single player is only fun to play around this time now, if you're looking to play multiplayer then don't bother with it. You'll rarely find anyone. I would only recommend this game if you enjoy the single player alone.			",36,1,3,1,0,0,1

												One of my favorite arcade racing games. It has pretty bad graphics even for a 2008 game, it's quite buggy, it has a crappy menu system and poor controller support, and also has unskippable live-action cutscenes that fail to convey anything even resembling a story. However, it has just the right amount of customization, the cars are very fun to drive no matter if it's a Tier 1 or Tier 4 car. The game world is diverse for driving, though again, not in apperance. There's winding country roads, city areas, and long highways where you can take your car all the way to the top of its abilities. 252mph seems to be the speed limit in this game, with a fully upgraded Bugatti Veyron. The police system is just a tad too unforgiving, but it's relatively simple and it is a very, very easy game to learn and quite difficult to master. The game is oftentimes too simple in the beginning no matter what car you choose, but if you choose the wrong car later in the game, you'll have a hard time beating the game. Highly recommended considering its base price on Steam is $10. One playthrough will last almost 20 hours.			",690,148,29,63,49,7,96

												Need for Speed: Undercover is developed by EA Black Box and published by Electronic Arts (EA) on November 18, 2008Old Arcade Need for Speed game.As for me i really like it, it has good races and missions, the AI is not bad but sometimes do crazy things. I completed this game in 16 hours and i had a great time. If u liked the older U2 MW or C maybe u will like it too. I dont like race track Need for Speeds cuz u can go to the racetracks in real life with a car... but in the real life u cant go with 160mph on the streets. The Graphics is not bad, but its old today. Pros:   -So many cars           -Tuning           -Street race           -Story           -Car damage           -You can have all of the carsCons:  -Short Story           -AI sometimes makes you cry           -Too much bright sun, its always early morning or late afternoon.           -Driving is really arcadeI still like it, its a good game.

												If you liked previous games in the series such as Most Wanted and Carbon, you probably won't like this one anywhere near as much. The free roam isn't all that enjoyable because the police are around every corner, making it very hard just to drive around having fun with it. The races are fairly easy. A 5 year old wouldn't have trouble with them. The game took me about 10 hours to complete my first run. Unless you're gonna be paying a very small amount for it, don't bother. You're probably better off with hot pursuit.			",71,8,0,32,7,1,7

												Finishing the story was a giant pain in the ♥♥♥. The events were horribly unbalanced, you'd show up on the cops' radar for literally doing nothing, and the car selection is hilariously small compared to other NFS titles. If Need For Speed: World had a story mode, this is it, and we all know how unbalanced the events in that game were. But I will give EA props for one good thing: half the money for the same BS in other Need For Speed games. So as the master of disapproving, I disapprove of this game.			",71,11,2,5,12,0,1

												Out of the 110+ games in my library, this is by far the worst. As a Need for Speed fan this game is a major dissapointment. The graphics consist of ludacrus amounts of bloom and motion blur. You cannot find an screen resolution that isn't 4:3. There is literally no physics engine. NFS Hot Pursuit 2, a game from 2002, is better in both of these departments. If you want an older NFS game like this one just buy Most Wanted 2005 or Carbon.			",70,8,15,5,27,1,10

The graphics are fairly decent for the time, there is a good amount of cars, and for once, it's a NFS game with a partially decent storyline. I don't know why I love this game, I just do. The only problem I have is that gamepad support is abysmal. The sheer force of my thumb lying on top of the Joystick is enough to make the car always lean left.

												The Need for Speed trillogy has been an all time favourite for me ever since most wanted to Undercover, This game has shown a great deal of what it would be like to move throught the streets with a great deal of speed. I personally recommend this game but if you dont like racing games or have the patience for it this isnt the game for you.			",24,2,0,7,3,0,0

												I absolutely LOVE this game! The racing, at least for me, has the best overall performance for a keyboard-driven racer. The acceleration, the handling are superb, and crashing into the side of the road or wiping out is not a deterrent to continuing the race. In fact, the overall handling and performance is so good, I have to look at all the other racers I've bought through Steam with some disdain. For this game, which seemed lukewarm in reviews, to completely outshine games better reviewed, more expensive, even flashier racers, makes me re-think racing games. Most of all, in regard to this game, is the crazy amounts of FUN I find myself having...racing on crowded streets (or mildly crowded...you can decide this) and being chased by the police with a realistic feel and the rush that comes with it is astounding, and the fact I can continue the race or chase even when I hit a pole or other car or even spin out of control makes me look at all other racers differently. I bought this on sale, and have rarely been happier with a purchase. I'd pay full price for this, especially when it's priced lower than other NFS titles. But it's all about NFS for me, from now on! AMAZING value, AMAZING capability with a keyboard. I just wish Steam would pick up the NFS Most Wanted line-up and DLC's. I did get Hot Pursuit because of this game, and it's really good...but the handling is best with Undercover.			",752,135,17,57,19,6,16

( Not a big fan of racing games but this one is really great. )Positive : Great cars , no bugs , no super-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI , the police's poursuits are pretty entertaining even tho they can be annoying some times , graphics pretty good at max ( For the date where the game got released ) , controls not that bad and menu's pretty simple , AND THAT MUSIC THO !Negative : Annoying story , no one gives a damn about this story , Some missions are reaaaaally easy , and others can be either way hyper-difficult for X reason even though there is like 8-9 sorts of missions , the cars CANNOT be sold , just deleted .... Where's the damn sense in this ? , the first car you will have can be only one you will use the whole game . . .

												Ok, so I am a big NFS fan and I was skeptikal about buying this one. But after playing it for just a short time, I began to really enjoy it. Also the game looks amazing, they did a great job porting this game and allowing the player to tweek the settings however you please. The gameplay is a bit like NFS most wanted (The original) and that is what I like most about it. It feels familiar, and has a pretty good story so far, if you are a fan of NFS games or just want a cool racing game to buy, this would be one of my recomandations			",127,30,9,27,5,0,12

												I cannot fully review this game as one small concern holds me back from playing this.I'm NOT saying I do not recommend this game. The more I play this game, the worse the lighting gets.  The sun's glare is unbearable and ruins the settings the game supplies.  The lighting also blurs and blends the colors in such a way that I cannot stand.The gameplay is how you'd expect like in previous titles NFS: Carbon and Most Wanted with a hint Burnout-like handling.After buying this game, immediately fool with the graphical settings to your point of comfort.

												Need for Speed Undercover is the story of Lightning McQueen, a hotshot racecar whose career stock is rising. On his way to a tie-breaking race for the esteemed Piston Cup, an interstate accident leaves him stranded in the long-forgotten community of Radiator Springs. Lightning finds himself under the scrutiny of the Route 66 town's law enforcement thanks to a sly attorney and soon-to-be love interest, Sally. While carrying out his sentence, he gets to know Doc Hudson, an older car with a mysterious past, and befriends a beat-up tow truck by the name of Mater. Most of the movie unfolds inside this ""Hillbilly Hell,"" where Lightning learns what it means to be a star and a friend.			",38,2,2,4,1,0,4

Good racing action. 2. As with all Need For Speed titles this one has a solid sound track. The Bad: 3. A bit repetitive.  Well its all about street racing isn't it? 4. Its not a new games which shows, but the action makes up for it.5. A very limited choice of cars. The Ugly: 6. Some of the cars you are forced to go on mission with are down right pathetic. 7. Some of the latter optional races are near impossible.  You can still complete the main story without winning these races. If you are looking for some enjoyable racing action look no further.

												Jeers:-Bad A.I. - A weird mix of rubberband and non-rubberband A.I, can be really unfair at the times.-Story was abit off - Could have gotten into more deeply into the undercover scene with twists in the plot along with a clear drawn story line on it.-Cop A.I. doesn't catch other racers or give a flying ♥♥♥♥ on the matter. (and sometimes doesnt even notice you pass by at 160kmh)-Some of the music choices arent really that great(,but there are some that are quite alright.)-First impressions of the driving controls I had, coming from the older need for speed games on pc, were awful. (But I got used to it.)-My version had occasionally civilian cars spawning from the sky and sometimes in the in-game cutscenes, the car's bodies were invisible.-Steering wheel support? You can dream about that.Cheers:+Cop A.I. itself seems to be more agressive, more willing and more realistic than the previous need for speed games.+They carried over the most aspects from need from speed ProStreet in regards of tuning (though I would had wished for total exact experience ripped out from ProStreet, 3 Engine tuning stages etc, Is simply not enough)+Get a top tier level car and it feels like a god damn spaceship, sort of fast.+Gameplay itself seems solid, along with the graphics seem to be, well... as good as 2008 EA can put out.+Large map full of all kinds of roadsOverall: Its quite fun game, would recommend if you would like some fast paced adrenaline rushes (although for that, I'd more likely recommend the ''Shift'' - series) with ♥♥♥♥ing some cops up. Also you get a girrrrrlllll in this game too as your waifu, as was seen in the same way in Most Wanted and in Carbon, but that's besides the point.

												I'm gonna start off with saying that this game will have its' moments where it will absolutely frustrate you beyond measure; I'm talkin' keyboard-smashing, controller-hurling frustration. And the main cause of it isn't even the challenging gameplay, though that does contribute. No no, it's the glitches. A few corners have horrible hitboxes, if I can call them that, to where you'll slam into an invisible wall during a sharp turn that'll lose you the race. Or perhaps the issue with the turning. On occasion, the left- or right- arrow keys will just decide not to work for a couple seconds, usually conveniently when you're trying to turn. You'll fly into the barrier with no reaction time, which will, again, lose you the race. Sometimes even the AI racers will spin you sideways onto their front bumper and you'll get permanently t-boned - you'll be unable to reverse or accelerate out of it, and the AI doesn't bother steering. Your only choice is to restart or quit entirely. I've had to repeat countless events because of issues like this. Of course, some of this frustration will come from the improved AI (which, let me tell you, is a big step up from previous Need for Speed games). The police units are definitely much smarter, and will attempt to spin you out, prevent you from turning so you run into a wall or spike strip, and even box you in. Quite impressive, but extremely annoying sometimes, expecially when they come in during a race and completely screw you over. Okay, that's enough cons. The pros; there is a fantastic variety of roads. Uphill, downhill, winding, long straights, banking turns, the whole shebang. They provide all the tests you would need to perfect your car, whether it be suspension or traction, top speed or acceleration. And once you've fine-tuned your vehicle, you can listen blissfully to the roaring engine down the long highways, or enjoy the view of the sexy beast you just created as you take it through the banked turns. Which brings me to my next point; the graphics. I'll admit the environment is not particularly special (the cliffs kinda look like manure piles; just collages of different shades of brown), but, as you would hope for from a racing game, the cars look fantastic, and quite accurate to their real-life equivalents. I can definitely say I've spent some time simply admiring a car I've just customized, or even one of the AI racers that caught my eye. And that brings up the customization possibilities, which might as well be infinite. Seriously. Every person in the world could play this game and be able to make a ride completely unique to everyone else's. Other than tons of spoilers and rims which can be widened, lengthened, deepened, and more, there are a couple hundred different vinyls that you can alter in size, position, color, angle, etc. to keep you busy, and a huge color panel to choose from as well. In fact, customization is probably where this game excels. The racing is sometimes questionable in terms of the physics, but definitely fun. The story is interesting I suppose, but will definitely get redundant if you wish to play it a second or third time, as I have done in order to get a variety of cars. But, despite its' faults, as you can tell by my gameplay hours, the appealing supercars and high-speed action has this game pulling me back every time.			",83,4,0,3,2,0,2

They use real persons as actors - gives the whole the right cheesy feeling. MINUS: The pictures on STEAM are quite misleading - there´s no blur at all. No damage model nor do you take any damage - although you can also crash - but either you go frontal into a pillar of concrete or you only are informed of it.  Not much to do.Story is predictable.

Some of the missions you have to do are hard even though you may or may not have an expensive car. I've played other games like Need For Speed: Hot Persuit. Although I do recommend this game I give it a 6.9/10			",50,2,1,2,5,3,0

												THIS GAME ! ( Not a big fan of racing games but this one is really great. )Positive : Great cars , no bugs , no super-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI , the police's poursuits are pretty entertaining even tho they can be annoying some times , graphics pretty good at max ( For the date where the game got released ) , controls not that bad and menu's pretty simple , AND THAT MUSIC THO !Negative : Annoying story , no one gives a damn about this story , Some missions are reaaaaally easy , and others can be either way hyper-difficult for X reason even though there is like 8-9 sorts of missions , the cars CANNOT be sold , just deleted .... Where's the damn sense in this ? , the first car you will have can be only one you will use the whole game . . . Just upgrade it enough to beat everyoneReview  : Great game , Great gameplay , No bugs , Nice graphics , O.K Ai , But annoying story and repetitive missions                              17/20 . ( Bought it for 2.5bucks so it's damn worth the price )			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												*Running from police in Bugatti Veyron at 246 mph, Police K9 SUV flys by at roughly 346mph and runs me off the road* Very solid NFS game, happy to relive the nostalgia for the price. The story is decent enough to keep you playing, towards the end it begins to feel like somewhat of a grind however. The mechanics tranfer well to the PC, cars seem to handle well enough for an arcade racer (using xbox 360 controller), the graphics are decent, but unfortunatly the autosculpt is broken on the steam version and it is a nightmare to use, so if you really, really care how your car looks you may want to steer clear of this one. 9/10 would flee again			",74,6,10,11,22,0,20
