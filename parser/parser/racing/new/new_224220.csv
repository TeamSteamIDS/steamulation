												☺ Easy to play.☺ Local co-op.☺ Suitable for most ages.☹ Short.☹ Difficulty spikes.Pressure can be summed up rather easily, short and sweet. The gameplay is a cross between a racer and shoot em up where you control a steam powered buggy and have to contend with a variety of enemies as you try to make it to the finish line without running out of steam...literally, if you dordle or allow one too many enemies to escape you'll not have enough pressure to keep your buggy going and grind to a halt.After a race you have the option to spend any coins collected to upgrade your buggy with a variety of weapons, tools, rams and a beefier buggy and while it doesn't really change how the game plays, the upgrades are very much required to progress and even on Normal Difficulty, you may hit some challenging spikes in difficulty. This isn't helped by seemingly being unable to redo won races during the campaign to collect more coins for upgrades - at one stage, I had to sell all previous unlocks in order to buy the parts needed to give me a fighting chance.Levels are largely similar, hold accelerate and fire and hurtle towards the finish line, boosting when available. Of special note are the few 'boss' levels which I found very enjoyable and changed up the pace of things enough to keep the game engaging.The presentation is lovely and the couple of cutscenes are humorous. It controlled well with an XBox Controller and was certainly playable, though slightly clunky with keyboard controls and the entire game can be played in local co-op and although Online Multiplayer is an option, at the time of playing there were no servers available.Pressure is rather enjoyable but very short, crossing the finish line at around three hours to clear the campaign races. It's certainly hard to recommend this game at full price as a result of this, but what's on offer is well polished and fun - if you want a game to play with your kids and you happen to see this game on offer, I'd say give it a go!

Pressure is a racing combat arcade game. You play as Morgan, a young man in his steam-powered attack vehicle, racing across the land battling evil minions to get the lake's water back from Count Soap II, who stole all of it to force the inhabitants to use his spa facilities.Pros: Nice game for all ages with colorful graphics and humoristic characters. You don't race against time, but instead against the loss of pressure you vehicle has, which is replenished from fighting off other wacky vehicles and passing check points. You have a multitude of upgrades you can purchase between races, whether car chassis, bumper, main weapon and secondary weapon. There's a long list of varied levels with little repetition, and an increasing variety of baddies to shoot, some straightforward and some requiring specific tactics.Cons: There is no story development to speak of (not that the game needs any). The game's focus isn't on the racing itself, but on completing the levels while killing all baddies and picking coins, so once completed there is little incentive to go back just to beat your time. The campaign mode doesn't allow to play back other levels, so you can't use your progression to do better in a past level.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!As far as arcade-style games go, this is a fun one to play. Levels are quick, so you can hop in for a few levels and leave, great for young gamers, casual gamers, or anyone looking for short play sessions. The game is exactly what it advertises to be, so if it looks interesting to you, knock yourself out!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												It's fun for a little bit. It's also very hard. We got to the second map and had a hard time beating it, it was on normal, still didn't beat it. You constantly run out of pressure before you get to the 3rd check point, and since you don't have enough coins to upgrade your vehicle, you will be stuck repeating the same map over and over. There is also an issue with losing connection from the server. I recommend this for the 99 cents sale that's going on now, but not for full price.			",258,65,4,11,40,2,19

												""Pressure"" is the abbreviation of ' ""lego racers"" meets ""just keep clicking with the left mouse button"" '. It's a game where you drive your car ""from above"" while trying to shoot whatever shoots you. It has really nice coins to pickup along the way (if you're from Mars and never played super mario, picking coins is good) and you can destroy stuff just because you missed your target and the bullets have to go somewhere.Now, let's us be serious for a moment:This game is funny and has a nice gameplay but it's ordinary and not original. I only recommend it because it's very well made and it's not really bad at all. I played for a bit and after a while i found it boring so i just waited for the trading cards to close it. I think that steam spoiled me and now my standards are too high.			",258,60,9,25,24,6,29

												This basic control/gameplay concept should never have made it out of the prototype phase.  You can only shoot in the direction your car is facing, which means you can either drive where you want or shoot where you need to—never both.As you are constantly being attacked by enemies pulling alongside you, the experience of the game is one of irritation as you are forced to point your vehicle every which way but where the road turns, swerving left and right like a drunken lunatic forever waving at flies.Pressure doesn't challenge you; it harrasses you.  This is simply the least amount of fun I've ever had driving a car mounted with a machine gun.			",1433,535,33,178,108,9,233

												Too simple and repetitive to recommend. My first time with the game, I thought I'd been playing for hours, but it had only been 30 minutes. Which is the opposite of what I want from a game. The graphics are nice, and it runs well. The handling is awful, which doesn't matter much since it's not about precise driving - but it's still somewhat annoying. May be fun for someone looking for a different take on a shmup,or those with very limited gaming time who just want to blow things up. It does have trading cards, which is always nice, but for some reason not mentioned anywhere on the store page.			",1603,732,61,207,160,18,229

												Pressure is a small but entertaining game, that brings you back to the good old years that you spent in the arcade halls. The gameplay is simple and fast-paced, and thanks to the steampunk graphics it's also enjoyable to watch. The levels are short, so you can take a break whenever you want. The game is a bit short in length overall, but still you can have a lot of fun in your big journey for water.Pressure is fun. It’s not designed to keep you going for hours, it’s more suitable for a quick round during your lunch break. The witty story, its decent sound and graphics and the fact that it’s simply to pick up compensate for the lack of variety in gameplay.Pressure is meant to entertain, and believe me when I say it does.Even if it's for a little while.

												Game Score: 2/10They should have called this game ""Boost and Shoot"" because that's all you ♥♥♥♥ing do!Pressure had a great idea but ended up with a broken chaotic mess. The first few stages it actually feels like a challenge to hit enemies for pressure and collect coins to upgrade, but then you realize none of that matters if you can make it to the checkpoints. Then once you get bouncing bullets it all goes out the window. Once you have bouncing bullets all you do is hold down the fire button and boost. The story was pathetically weak and most of the upgrades don't do anything helpful.BOOST AND SHOOT!Pros:- Huge variety of upgrades to your car- Colorful game with lots of enemies- Controls were responsiveCons:- Most upgrades are useless compared to bouncing bullets- The stages were nearly identical minus textures- Single player campaign and multiplayer campaign are seperate save slots- Your save file gets deleted when you finish the campaignAvoid this game. It's a waste of time. ",442,93,7,66,59,3,55

												I seem to be playing a lot of these ""pick up and play"" casual type games lately, Pressure is another one that I found myself being able to put a good few hours into without realizing. The gameplay  is basically a run and gun type scenerio, you are in your vehicle driving towards the finish line (although you aren't racing), and you have to blow up the bad guys that come out along the way. There is certainly no difficulty in this gamewhat so ever as you can just hold your finger on the trigger the whole time and smash your way through, especially once you get your hands on a battering ram upgrade for your car and a flame thrower. Another recommendation for the casual gamer.			",1544,456,43,234,159,12,209

												The controls for this game are really wonky. You'd think that a controller would be the best way to go with a game like this, but it really isn't. I found the controls much more intuitive with a mouse and keyboard.There is no map of the track, and the isometric view means you can't see much of the road ahead of you. At first I was like, ""What kind of crappy racing game is this?"" but then I realized that it's more of an arcade game than a racing one.You zoom through the game, avoiding obstacles and shooting bad guys. I'm not particularly great at either those things, but I am good at one thing: crashing. So I upgraded my car with a bunch of armor and some spikey rams, and I crashed into my enemies to my heart's content.The graphics are very cool, the soundtrack is fun, and (once you get used to the weird controls) the car controls respond quite well to your commands.The game was extremely fun at first, but it got very repetitive very quickly. The first boss fight was interesting. After that, there was a bunch more of the same ol', same ol'. Second boss fight: different and interesting. Then more boredom (oh but this time they removed most of the walls on the sides, so I actually had to pay attention to where I was driving instead of crashing into the sides, hee hee).There are new enemies introduced gradually, but they don't really change the gameplay very much. You still just zoom around, shooting or ramming them.You collect coins as you progress through the game, which you can then use to upgrade your vehicle. This process is a familiar game mechanic but is also confusing. None of the upgrades tell you what exactly you're buying. I bought a new gun, and only after using it was I able to say, ""Ahh, I see. This gun is way more powerful but has a slower rate of fire."" But nowhere does it tell you if the power on the basic version of this gun is equal to or better than a fully upgraded version of the previous gun. I'm not much of a number cruncher, but I would still like to know the basic stats of the equipment I am buying.If you want to go back and re-play levels (to get more coins or get a better score or something), you select ""Free Play"" from the single-player menu. I mention this because the campaign mode shows the entire map and doesn't let you go back to previous levels, which at first led me to believe that you were unable to revisit them.There is a multiplayer mode, which I presume would be fun to goof around in like a party game.It only took me about three hours to buy the best equipment for my car and complete the game. I might go back and try to get a better score on previous levels, but in all honesty, the game has little to no replayability. The repetitive gameplay might be okay if there were cool new paintjobs you could buy for your car or something, but as it is, I've already bought everything in one imperfect playthrough. This game needs something, anything that would give the player an incentive to pick it up and play again.If you can buy this game very cheap, it is definitely worth it. I had a coupon and picked it up for $1, and I definitely got more than a dollar's worth of entertainment out of it. I'm glad I didn't pay any more than that though.If you want a good-looking, fun little arcade game to play in short sessions, you will probably like this game.If you're expecting anything more than that, don't buy it.

This is a long review, so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend Pressure just skip to Results and read from there.Chasing Carrots creates a fun shoot 'em up arcade style driving game that keeps you on your toes. With silly lines and a rediculous story Pressure is the type of game that really pushes you at every turn. Story:Pressure, despite its low Metascore and rather dull describing reviews it’s actually quite a riveting game. Not too long, but fun till the end. Pressure has a rather funny, but very simple story. Pressure is about a young man who lives by a lake awakening to all the water being stolen. Who is the culprit you may ask? Well none other than an evil Sauna genius who decided to charge all of the community to use the lakes water from his sauna. In order to retrieve this water back from the depths of the evil sauna you must race through rivers, cliffs, mountains, buildings, and railways in order to defeat the evil geniuses waves of monsters. Gameplay:The levels are not timed with an actual timer, but rather a pressure gauge. As time moves on, the more you are hit, or as you progress through the course you gain or lose pressure. If the gauge goes to zero your car conks out and you lose the match. On the other hand if your car gets too shot up it can take extensive damage and blow up. So in order to win the race you need to go fast, avoid the bullets, and kill all the enemies. The game allows you to boost unlimited times, with each car offering different boost lengths, shoot unlimited ammo with many different guns, and use power ups. This game is like a blood bath, minus the blood and adding water. Results:The game isn't very difficult; it just has some interesting concepts which until you figure out how to properly use the game it seems rather difficult. With constant boosting, unlimited ammo, and nuclear weapons Pressure is a shoot 'em up racing game. Pressure offers a small campaign with multiplayer experience and brilliant high pressure (hah) action that keeps you on your toes. Don't be fooled you won't be racing against opponents in this epic as you'll be too focused on destroying everyone and everything in your way. If you like games where you can sit down for a short session and not have to dedicate too much time this is the game for you.Pros:+Smooth, easy gameplay+Smart difficulty curve+Simple but pleasant graphics+Friendly story with simple characters+Fast shoot 'em up gameplay+Loads of upgrades that allow you to customize and further boost your car.+Funny little story that isn't in any way inappropriate. +Lots of interesting baddies and boss fights to keep you interested.+Unlimited boosts and ammo, so you don't feel like you have to hold back.Cons-Not a racing game-Enemies seem to repeat themselves after you complete the first world-Hints are not given randomly, but rather as you progress throughout the game-You cannot go back and play an old level in the campaign to grind up your car (if you are having difficulties)			",330,44,5,40,30,0,70

												[ENG] Meh, this game is neither beautiful nor ugly, i think the ""Mostly Positive"" rating on steam is appropriate. This game is very short, i finished it in 3 hours more or less. It wasn't any special experience, but overall i appreciated it. The gameplay was cool, the soundtracks were nice and fit well with this style, and the graphic was really not bad.The storyline is quite banal, but the ending was totally no sense. There were cinematics during the storyline (even if stupid) but not in the ending, just wat? Also the final boss was too easy and nothing original. Despite this detail, i would reccomend this game only for a very low price, don't expect anything challenging.Ps: Obviously don't expect to play online with other players since no one plays it.[ITA] Meh, questo gioco non è nè bellissimo nè brutto, penso che la valutazione ""Perlopiù positiva"" sia appropriata. Questo gioco è molto corto, l'ho finito in circa 3 ore. Non è stato niente di eccezionale, ma dopotutto l'ho apprezzato. Il gameplay è carino, le musiche anche e calzano con lo stile, e la grafica non è per niente male. La trama è abbastanza banale, ma il finale è stato veramente privo di senso. Durante la storia sono presenti filmati (anche se stupidi), e non ne hanno messo nemmeno uno per il finale, wtf? Inoltre il boss finale è stato troppo semplice e per niente originale.A parte questo dettaglio, consiglierei questo gioco solo per un prezzo veramente basso, non aspettatevi niente di impegnativo.Ps: Ovviamente non aspettatevi di poter giocare online con altri giocatori poichè nessuno ci gioca.

												An entertaining, albeit short, game. There're quite a few levels, yet they're short (I sped through the game on easy in 2 hours, but spent 10 hours in ""absurd"" difficulty lol). The levels are well designed, and there's a good number of enemy types, weapons, and upgrades. What I didn't like though, is that you can only shoot in the direction you're headed in, which is weird, and made shooting enemies that are beside, or behind you quite annoying.			",82,17,2,8,8,0,2

												As soon as I finished my first level of the game, I already knew what my conclusion will be. It's like eating the food that looks nice, but has a really bad taste, so people end up giving it a few bites and throwing away. Here is why I think this game is not worth your time and money. Yes, I must say it's fun to shoot the enemies, but the game is made that way so you can't see anything beyond your vehicle. You just don't have time to look at your HP or Pressure which is located in the worst place possible. I have also found the main story quite rediculous as well as the rumor. I have played the game on several occasions with each session no longer than 10 minutes. Let's see what the navigation through the game is like. The mouse behaves like someone is constantly pushing it forward and making you misclick pretty much all the time. The main menu looks fine, but as soon as you progress to your garage menu everything changes, literally. The main menu is just a simple menu with the text inside the buttons. However, the garage menu goes full 3D and there is no text anymore, you may as well click everywhere to try and find the correct menu. It actually has only 2 useful buttons, so I can't see any reason why developers would make it so complex. The graphics are interesting so is the art. I enjoyed seeing all the explosions and other stuff, everything looks belivable. Couln't see much effects on what thought. On the other hand, I have an average computer and this game gives it a lot of trouble. I am not sure why this game overheats my graphics card more than CoH2 for example, but that's how it is. What about the sound? I found music really annoying, but it's still bearable. The sound effects of explosions and the vehicles are fine. Although the characters make the sound like they are about to have an ♥♥♥♥♥♥ everytime they are hurt. I would say that if you do have this game, then you will probably play it about once a month for no more than 30 minutes at maximum. This is not something you want to go back to in a long time. To sum up this whole thing, I'd say that this game has some nice art and visuals, but the gameplay is on major down side. If not on sale (80-90% off) then I would not recommend buying it, it's likely that you will regret it in the first 10 minutes of your gameplay.			",167,29,10,30,25,0,38

												Excellent little top down arcade driving shooter mash up. Weapon variety in regards to what you can equip your small car with is nice and offer various type of shooting modes. Tracks get harder each time adding new obstacles such as towers. And the graphics serve the game well with a quircky cartoon style that never gets old. Multiplayer is a blast, haing a friend to blow up or blow ♥♥♥♥ up together has never been more fun.			",198,24,7,35,7,2,34

												It's a fun little casual game if you like arcade style things. It's pretty simple you only drive one way and just keep shooting various enemies / collecting coins as you go. Three bosses total all pretty simple. Various upgrades aswell nothing to fancy and that's about all there is to it.I'd get it onsale / free if they do another key drop though.

												Picked this for a coop experience with my brother and it was like a fresh breath of air. Game is well optimized for this (keep in mind we played local coop, with controllers connected to the same pc), game automatically picks up if another player connects, controls are never an issue with hand-held controllers, and it was simply a great coop experience!Gameplay wise Pressure is lots of mindless fun. There is no racing here, the game is rather a ""chicken invaders"" kind of game but with cars. You upgrade your car, weapons, ram through gold earned after each race-fight, and there is enough variety. Game can be challenging, but rewarding once you pick a strategy of weapon combos and destroy everything.There is a short story to provide a background with some cut-scenes, which are made with a light sense of humour and charm. Definetly recommended, especially for a local coop experience.			",181,100,2,17,10,3,25

												Well, this game is cool. Mechanics include Racing against your dropping steam pressure (you can think it as fuel), you gain bits of extra fuel for all enemy vehicles you destroy. You have to parry the attacks of enemy vehicles (though their attacks are not very powerful). You have a lot of upgrades on your vehicles, guns, bumpers, etc. The game can be played co-op, even on the same computer. I am enjoying it so far.			",568,172,18,47,35,4,71

												This is a fun game, but there are flash games that do this (vehicle going through hordes of enemies) better. The scenery quickly becomes stale, with few levels having any unique scenery. The game doesn't allow you to re-visit previous levels to get more money for upgrades, which I personally don't like. The gas component to the game is either irrevelent (in easy and normal gamemodes) or impossible to get around (hardcore gamemode).			",61,13,1,8,4,2,4

												- A really fun game with nice gameplay that doesn't require too much thinking (One might think this is a racing game, it's not, you just drive and shoot at things and make them go BOOM!)- A simple story that doesn't require too much attention,- Neat & light-demanding graphics.- Very funky, fun and groovy music in my favorite genre of music - Funk.- Endless replayability value.- CO-OP mode!The only downside here is the controls, a bit too sensitive on the remote when turning around, and requires pushing some buttons constantly (Such as shooting and accelerating), which makes the whole control scheme quite uncomfortable.To sum it up, just a really neat game that I can play whenever I'm bored.

												Игра расчитана на детей до 12 лет, возможно им даже понравится бы сюжет( да да вы не ослышались в Pressure попытались впихнуть сюжетную линию) который весьма скудный и бесмысленный главное что в игре лёгкое управление и хорошая атмосфера. Вообще игра получилась не скучная и в некоторых моментах весёлая правда я потратил на её прохожденеи 3.5 часа но не пожалел что купил её! В игре присутствует прокачка оружия. тачки и способностей, всё это конечно здорово но однообразно и я думаю что если игра была длинее она быстро надоела бы разве что на планшете.

												Pretty fun, but I wouldn't recommend it for those looking to get easy achievements. If you want to 100% this game, you have to memorize the pattern of enemies and coins in each level well enough (you have to repeat a level to get through the next one and depending on your choice this can be very tough), as well as defeat and avoid enough enemies to beat the hard difficulty. You might also have to grind and replay the game to experiment with upgrades in order to know the most efficient build for harder achievements.You can't go back to previous levels to better your scores, so getting the last achievement can be hard (even on easier difficulty, i would guess.. but haven't tried yet). I don't know if I can recommend this for co-op because it might frustrating for some.7.5			",638,166,16,115,52,7,80

It's very challanging to reach the finish line at some levels but thats the beauty of it. I haven't tried the multi mode so not sure about that. I'm happy palying the single mode :p I got the game when it was on sale and I think it's worth it. If you're into this genre it should be very enjoyable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

They just aren't great. Good concept, poor execution. Don't waste your money. There are better games out there.Edit: I tried the game with a different controller and it was a better experience. I used a true xbox controller as opposed to a logitech one. It's definately not my favorite game but it is worth playing now.			",73,24,8,5,4,0,1

												This game is alright. Maybe. It feels so slow paced. I played the first few levels and found myself bored because of the repititious level design. It's a weird vertical scrolling shooter, and you can control your own pace to even go backwards, so it feels the player is given too much power. Your most common death will most likely be from losing all your pressure from some ""suckers"" that steal your pressure. I really hate how there is no windowed option, but you can still change the resolution. Even though I got this for only a dollar, it still wasn't worth it then, and it certainly isn't worth it now.

												Are you bored? Are you capped? Have you been bullied to much on other games and feel like changing to another game? Then try Pressure. Pressure is an Indi game that combines cars, shooting and upgrades into an action packed game that will leave you playing for about a week. Although it does consume some of your time to complete, it is well worth the play. During the game you go against multiple bosses which are simple to defeat but do require some thinking.Now put your driving and shooting skills to the test and have some fun!			",36,2,1,0,2,0,2

												I think I got this game as part of a Humble Bundle. Its a fun little game to waste time on, where the focus is more on killing enemies on the race track than being an actual racing game. You have health of course, and since your enemies can shoot you, you can obviously die. But, in keeping with the funny steam-punk theme, you also have pressure, which is basically your turbo, so you can speed ahead and ram enemies. You can run out of it though, so you have to keep it up by killing enemies and passing checkpoints. The different weapons, rams, power-ups, and car-bodies you unlock are pretty fun. So, overall, a fun little game...buy it if its on sale.			",218,52,1,27,15,0,17

												I'll be honest, I bought it with a coupon, but this is the most fun I've had in a while, mainly due to the game's challenge. The downside is that the game ends up castrating the challenge by creating a customization menu that, while intricate, falls apart halfway through the game by providing little incentive for the player to go for the next item on the list, instead jumping straight to the big guns and turning the game into a ""Hold M1"" to win scenario.The verdict? It's good. Buy it if you have only a few minutes per day to play video games, or want something a bit more mind-boggling than Solitaire to kill time.			",120,19,3,24,14,0,4

Pressure is an addictive shoot 'em up style game with humorous characters, catchy soundtracks and flashy graphics.  It constantly introduces new enemies, offers you to customize your rig, plays goofy cartoon cutscenes, in other words, it diversifies the gameplay a little bit. It's main purpose is to kill time, hence I suppose it would be a better choice to develop this for a mobile phone. Overall, even if it's a fun game, I wouldn't buy it, especially for 8€, however, if you're a fan of fast paced arcade games you may enjoy it a lot.5/10 ",203,42,10,15,12,1,17

												Certainly fun and interesting, but not quite fully realized or well-executed.  What you see is pretty much what you get, except that's pretty much it for the whole game.  You fight a ""time limit"" while trying to compete in a pseudo-score attack environment while staying alive, and all of that together combined with the chaos of the hordes of enemies swarming around you is great, at least for a while.The only thing that really changes throughout the game is how much health your enemies have and your environment.  With the proper couple of upgrades, I found myself nearly invincible and mostly just annoyed at how much health (on the enemies) that was thrown at me.  Little strategy was needed in just slamming my face into the enemies over and over to destroy them as quickly as possible, and I even binged on offense and used a low grade of defense for over half the campaign in terms of upgrades.The camera angle doesn't allow you to effectively gather the coins, so picking those up is mostly luck.  Got an ""all-ages"" thing going with the pretty cringey sense of humor and honestly lame scenarios, aside from the ""grand plan"".  Can't say I've ever seen that before.Bottom line, it's certainly worth a look and a single (pretty short) playthrough, but it doesn't have much staying power or any outstanding moments.  The 10 dollar price tag is iffy, but at least the game feels like they tried.			",597,158,28,51,30,6,74

												This game features, Local Coop and Multiplayer, but i was only playing singleplayer mode. I can tell you that the game is very easy to control. This game most likely fits all ages. The game is getting bored really fast. Nothing exciting really happens other than the fact that you get chased by cars and small tanks until you reach the goal. Afterwards you can upgrade you vehicle for the gold you collected, almost like the Android games that you can find on Google Playstore.  ",75,4,2,2,0,1,6

												Drive down a very long, dry riverbedGet shot atShoot backMaybe collect enough coins to upgrade your vehicleRepeatThis game looks like it might be fun, but it turns out you just do the same thing over and over again on every level.  You drive your attack cart along a very long course while being attacked by an endless supply of enemies.  The single worst aspect of this game is that you must kill a large percentage of the enemies in order to fuel your vehicle and reach the level end.  Strangely, damage to your cart doesn't seem to matter at all, but failing to shoot enemies will leave you sitting in the dust.  For whatever reason, the enemies seem to just want to take potshots at you as they drive by, so you have to kill large groups of them quickly in order to not fail the level and be forced to start over.There is some variety to the enemies, but it doesn't matter much since you still have to try to shoot them all.  If you happened to pick up any coins while driving through the course you can use them to purchase bigger weapons or more armor for your cart.  Afterwards, move on to the next level, which is guaranteed to feel almost identical to the one before it.  Personally, I don't like doing the same thing for every level of a game, so I'd not recommend this game.			",261,95,7,15,27,2,18

												The store page says that this game offers full controller support, and I would have to say that that information is false. What I think of when I see full controller support is the ability to remap the controller to avoid hand cramps.This game has hand cramps.Holding RT and A on my Xbax controller caused my hand cramps.Pros: Overall I'd have to say it's fun in short bursts, and local multiplayer with a friend is probably the best way to play it.Graphics and audio are cutesy, but the gameplay is rather challenging. The basics: you drive, ram, and shoot your way through enemies, and your car runs on pressure. I always run low on pressure before coasting on my momentum to the checkpoints, if I don't run out completely.Cons: Hand Cramps. Limited options. Limited (though still interesting) customization.Final verdict: 7/10 - flawed, but essentially good for your money.			",163,53,0,14,8,0,4

												- Controls are incredibly simple  - Handles better with a 360 controller I found- Fair variety of enemies- Change in level themes keep the game more interesting- Pretty cool boss fights (only 3 of them [30 levels, 1 boss fight for every 10])- Incredibly short- Can't replay levels until game is beaten- Gets incredibly harder as you progress (even on the ""standard"" difficulty)- Levels can get repetitious until after the theme of the level's changed (levels after a boss fight)- Most upgrades weren't necessary as it was easy enough to save up and acquire the best upgradesFound it to be a bit fun but it's not really a must-have whatwith it being so short and potentially repetitious to many.

												Pressure is a fun indie racing game that is reminiscent of mario kart that is morphed with a shooter. I received this game through a 75% off coupon and it was easy to pick up the controls. The first thing that captivated me about this game is the incredible art direction which is colourful, unique and has variation as you progress through the game. The game has a very basic premise which was executed well and has decent graphics and good humour. As you progress through the stages, the landscape varies and there are refreshing and unique boss battles. I played the game with an x-box controller and there is good compatability with the controls. Some of the negatives with this game include the lack of tutorials in the game that explain how the 'pressure' bar works or the inability to repeat previous levels in the campaign. However, after playing for a few hours, the gameplay becomes quite repetitive and consists of holding down the 'fire' and 'accelerate' buttons whilst occasionally firing the secondary weapons and the booster. I think it would be great if they implemented an 'overheat' function to the primary weapon.   Overall, i think this is a great game to pick up and play for a couple of hours.			",45,8,1,7,4,0,10

												This was a fun little game - good but not great.  It's not really a racing game - you are in a car, but it's more about killing baddies and making it through the checkpoints without dying.  The best part of the game is the car upgrades - primary weapons, secondary weapons, rams and new cars.  The main downside is the lack of variety.  Every level is just make it through checkpoints.  The scenery really only changes every 10 levels when you get a boss and go to a new world. The boss fights are fun, but there are only 3 (for a total of 30 levels).  Check out the demo.

												Pressure is a very polarising game. While the game mechanics itself is simple: you have this ""steam"" car and you need to reach the end of the course without running out of steam, and there are bazillion enemies to get in your way out to make sure you don't finish... but you can shoot them. What does that have to do with foiling a criminal mastermind's plan to create the ultimate spa by sucking up every drop of water in the river? Almost nothing. The game plays a bit like River Raid / 1942 and similar genre with vehicles that can overtake you, vehicles started from the sidelines, stationary turrets and obstacles (that slows you down if you hit them) and so on. There are even occasional ""bosses"" (super-large vehicles). The only change from the formula is basically the road curves this way and that, and you need to turn, and it's isometric / top-down hybrid view. Your vehicle shoots only straight ahead, so aiming is a bit of a problem as you must turn the entire vehicle to aim. You do, however, have a good selection of weapons... If you managed to soak up enough gold coins on the course to afford them. There are a lot of different things to upgrade on the vehicle, from type or grade of weapons to speed / agility of the vehicle to ramming power, and much more. But they don't feel *that* different. Your basic machine gun, upgraded, seem to work fine, at least for the earliest 10-20 missions. There is quite a bit of humor, and definitely PG if not G outright. And graphics are good, but somehow I never really liked the game.			",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

												The game looks fun but its clunky controls and dead multiplayer changed my view. The singleplayer was dissapointing because nothing really interesting stood out. The main objective for those singleplayer levels I've gone through was to reach the finish line without having your health and pressure (fuel) depleted from enemies riding alongside you. After each level I was able to purchase new available vehicles or parts to aid in my progression but this feature did not motivate me to continue because of how the controls felt.			",94,1,0,0,1,0,3

												Not really a bad game overall I suppose but MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A CONTROLLER.  Mouse and keyboard is night impossible to control due to the lack of any sort of aiming mechanism.  No dot, square, circle or any other helpful aiming tool, just have to swerve side to side and hold down the fire button.  My interest waned immediately upon realizing this.			",333,42,5,38,11,3,52

												An odd game that is more fun to watch than play... It basically plays almost like an infinite runner, except technically you can go backwards but the game punishes you for taking too long to finish a level. Not that you're meant to explore the levels anyway. An infinite runner bullet hell game on a rail track disguised as a road.The gameplay is difficult but not in a good way rather a very cheap way. Controlling your weapons is often tiredsome and you basically have only two attacks at best and a short boost. Enemies basically sight in on you instantly and harrass you, enemy magnet/bullet magnet you are. You can't really dodge them so you have to destroy them right away which would be fine if the controls were a little more sophisticated and the combat was more refined.After playing I really thought this was a ported mobile game but apparently not. It looks great, it CAN be fun but it's rather limited and poorly designed - mechanics-wise, at the end of the day afaic. The 64 metacritic rating is basically spot on. It's not a disaster but it's a very YMMV game for most players.			",745,134,23,93,104,10,118

												I did enjoy the game when I got the demo, so I bought a copy for myself and a friend to play online.  Unfortunately the game seems to be abandoned by the developers, and playing online is impossible.  Not just for me, but a Google search shows a lot of people can't get it to work - and emails to the support are either ignored completely or replied to with stock answers that in no way demonstrate attention or care about the issues.The single player was fun for a bit - repetative, cute cut scenes - but the MP was the real reason I got this.  I would NOT pay full price for this, even without the MP issues.  I got it on a deep sale and got my money out of single player.But if you want a fun MP game or a game that is guarenteed to work, I would go elsewhere.  There are tons of games that have support and are not bugged out for the same price or less.  So close to being a fun game!			",109,62,1,20,12,1,10

												Amazing game! I simply love the gameplay! There are a huge variety of guns and powerups to choose from and plowing through enemies feels quite satisfying.

												The game looks fun but its clunky controls and dead multiplayer changed my view. The singleplayer was dissapointing because nothing really interesting stood out. The main objective for those singleplayer levels I've gone through was to reach the finish line without having your health and pressure (fuel) depleted from enemies riding alongside you. After each level I was able to purchase new available vehicles or parts to aid in my progression but this feature did not motivate me to continue because of how the controls felt.			",94,1,0,0,1,0,3

												If you're anywhere near my age and played the Crash Bandicoot racing game, you'll find a similar feel and artistic style in this with an updated look and suspiciously odd similarities to certain Pixar/Disney 3D CG films; Pressure builds (pardon the pun) a great deal of fun in to an exciting game. Yes, this game type has been done many times before, but the developers managed to capture enough nostalgia and fresh fun to keep things interesting throughout. You could purchase the game early in the morning and finish at least one of the modes of it by lunchtime or early afternoon, which makes it a great thing to play if you're looking for something that you can easily get from beginning to end in a short time. Again, it has the feel of a Crash Bandicoot style game with its overt zanyness and fast-paced gameplay. The worst thing I can honestly say about this game is that it seems to be aimed toward a certain age group and there are certain things that may be considered inappropriate for that age group. As something that can be a lot of fun for people of all ages, I did find myself being somewhat overwhelmed by the ""cute"" factor at times. Is this a drawback? To some it may be, I found the use of adorable artwork and funny characters to be charming in one way, and irritating in another. The other major critique I have is in regards to the music in the game. With very little variety, you're likely to be putting the volume of it on mute and listening to your favorite album(s) in the background while playing the game itself. While this may not seem like a big deal, a soundtrack can lend a great deal toward my overall interest in replaying a game In short I would give the game a 6.5 out of 10, and would bump it up a star if the soundtrack weren't so amateurish and irritating. The voice acting is funny, but it would've been nicer to have something interesting to listen to while actually inside of a level, and maybe some minibosses toward the end of each level, I don't think that other than the major bosses there's anything that could be considered a ""boss"" or what have you. About as much fun as you could pack in to 4 hours of gaming, even if repeated playthrough is a bit unlikely because of the structure and overall repetition of the game. I noticed very little difference between play modes other than getting slightly more irritated with the same things you have to keep an eye in on all of them. .			",2906,1132,96,353,353,29,474

												While I had seen somewhat mixed (edging towards positive) reviews on this game, this is the kind that got my attention by its playthrough videos and screenshots. Sure enough, I was not disappointed when I gave it a shot myself. You can get my first impressions of this title in this video:


YouTube™ Video: Pressure - 3D First Impressions 

			Views: 40		

			Taking a look at a cool little indie game of a genre I would call a tantalizing encounter between racing game and shoot em' up!		

* Warning: Steam though it would be a good idea to break all stereoscopic videos. Head to YT to watch it, make sure you are using Flash, not HTML5.First off, maybe I'll get lenient because the game works very well with Tridef Ignition in stereo-3D using the driver's 2D+depth feature (Power 3D). The game simply looks excellent with added depth perception and given its nature, it adds all that much more to the experience, even going as far as helping the game play a lot!Some can give it criticism for not having enough varied shmup features while others can find the lack of actual racing elements  sort of a letdown, for its price (even more so when it lands on sale) it actually falls very well within my expecations and the 10$ range sort of opens up tolerance for elements that may lack, but do not bring down the gameplay itself in a notable way.Don't be too surprised - this is in NO way a racing game - rather a different take on a shmup, this one being loaded with SPEEDING elements. You won't beat anything by passing rather you have to speed through the levels and defeat the enemies with your gun, not your driving. In fact you're encouraged to drive THROUGH enemies, not around them (which I find quite satisfying; the ram mechanics are funny).My only valid criticism could be on that aspect. I see this game as a sort of buildup to what it would've actually liked to be. This is sort of the beginning of the genre and I hope they can build a sequel and attempt to experiment more with an ACTUAL racing / shmup balance. This concept would definitely benefit from more actual race-like elements and maybe a POV that gives you more of a forward view.Needless to say, this game is definitely a lot of fun. When it comes to a Yes/No scenario - a much easier type of review to do than an actual SCOCRE - I have to give this one a ""GO"".			",118,17,6,4,16,0,1

												I got this product via a steam (mystery) gift and I just laughed the entire time I played the game, it looks stupid, feels stupid, plays stupid and is just stupid. Now why do I not recommend it? Because the joke got old after a while, I am only recommending you to play this thing if you are high and you already have it for some god-forsaken reason.

												I got this game for very cheap and decided to give it a go.On the core, it's okay, and I got my money's worth (1 to 3 bucks at the max if memroy serves), but I cannot recommand the game because of the following things that annoyed me:1- Camera vew angle is ackward: Let's face it, the camera gives an areal view and it feels weird.2- Controls unfriendly that I couldn't change. I used an xBox controller as this was a ""racing game""; and boy were the controls hard to get adapted to! At the best of my knowledge you cannot change them. Idk about keyboard controls but I am assuming the worse.3- Very elaborate achievments: a couple of achivements are to gather all gold coins and kill all enemies, This is way too elbaborate, given the fact that one needs to restrart the tracks several times. This is the type of games that I can only play once and keep in my library to eat dust. Should you buy this game? Only if it's on sale and very cheap. You can squeeze a few hours out of it.

Thats right, so if you want to go back to a level to get some more coins becouse you bought a bad weapon and got stuck in a level, well , YOU GOT TO RESTART ALL OF THE GAME.And for last the gameplay, the car is not the best thing to drive, and you need to always be holding two buttons (accelerator and main weapon) and press turbo everyt 2 secconds plus the secondary weapon every 5 seconds, which after a time makes your hand hurt alot.

												At first when attempting to run the game it would not run. I visited the forum and found the workaround. Then when attempting to do anything in the game client it would freeze up and display more errors rendering it completely unplayable. I cannot recommend this title due to the game breaking bugs. (Actually I'm not sure this even is a game I was unable to make it past the menu). For those wondering the time in game is time spent sitting on the menu just so I could idle and get the trading cards to redeem some of the money wasted on this title.			",1172,478,48,127,138,11,138

												This is a game that your children would enjoy... provided they can learn the controls. I haven't gotten very far into it, but from what I've seen, you play a mad scientist inventor type who enjoys his life in a lakeside cabin. The game begins with an overly cartoony cutscene showing that the bad guys have drained the lake for their evil purposes. Being the only one who cares about the lake, your character rushes out to battle in a steam-powered buggy -- which is ironic due to the fact that all the water (the source of steam) has been stolen.Story aside, this game has a lot of irritations. (I wouldn't call them flaws -- the game is certainly playable, but it has minor annoyances that make the game unattractive.) The artwork is quite nice, but the humor expressed through the animation is slapstick and childish. Again, this would make a great game for children.A major irritation (at least with keyboard and mouse) is the akwardness of the controls. For one, hard turning is impossible without getting disoriented. Also, you can't shoot and drive in different directions. Your aim is locked forward, which means that you can either finish the level within the time limit or with max kills.Secondly, you're constantly being pushed forward. If you stop for a collectible, the enemies pass you, you can't catch up to them, and you're stuck with no pressure (fuel) and no powerups to attain more pressure.Third, every level is more or less the same. I understand that most games (especially level-based games like this) can't stray too far from the original concept without making the game incredibly difficult to play or incredibly difficult to program. However, it seems as though you just have to shove your way through (battering ram is the only useful upgrade) while holding ""w"" the whole time for every single level.Lastly, and, arguably, most irritating, is that you can't replay levels. There comes a point in the game when you just can't go any further without upgrades. At the same time, you don't have the money for the upgrades. The only way you can get money is by completing levels, but you can't replay them. Not to mention that if I just thought level 7 was cool and wanted to replay it, I wouldn't be able to. Sorry, you can't try for a better score. Sorry, you can't gain more coins to spend on upgrades. Sorry, you can't just play through a previous level for fun.All in all, this game can be fun if you don't get irritated by all the little nuances that make it difficult to enjoy. If you're anything like me, however, this game may provide half an hour's worth of entertainment every month or so.			",43,13,1,7,13,0,10

												""Mostly Positive"" reviews my @ss. This game is just not fun. First off, you hold down right trigger to accelerate but you also have to hold down A the entire time to fire. That would be fine, but you have to hold down A with the middle of your thumb because you have to, get this, press the X button every few seconds the entire race to get a boost, otherwise you will never make it to any checkpoints. Holding down both right trigger and A and pressing X over and over and over and over and over again the whole time kills this game dead. And that is pretty much all you do in the game and it is just not fun at all. That and the fact that you need pressure, or gas, to keep going and you get it from killing enemies. Problem is that the slightly larger enemies take way too many hits to kill so they stay on screen and shoot you for way too long. You get flooded with dozens of enemies and they have pin-point auto-aim accuracy and never stop firing. They also barely give off any pressure (gas) at all so if you don't die before a checkpoint, you run out of gas. I couldn't beat the 4th race so I said fk this. Sure with practice I could beat it, but the problem is that the game is just not fun and has poor gameplay like I described. The only good thing about it is the graphics. The music is the most stock generic awful up-tempo elevator music that you could imagine. It is the stuff of nightmares.This game is a perfect example of the abuse of the steam rating system by complete ret@rds who don't know what a good game is.Sucks/10			",583,81,11,48,20,5,43

 #LittleLycanOnSteam   Hello Reader  , If You Are Reading This Review, Don't Keep Your Hopes High As It's Not A Review As Such But My Feelings About Any Games Including This One. I May Have Played Or Not Played This Game, Still I Will UpVote It As I Know How Much Efforts, Blood And Sweat Is Used To Make Any Sort Of Game, Irrespective To Big Or Small, Branded Or Small Devs. I Personally Do Not Have Time To Play All Games, So I Just Idle Them, No Offence, Just For The Cards But I Know That The Game Is Worth Shot Even If Not Worth Our Time As It Requires Tremendous Efforts To Make Even The Simplest Of All Games. God Bless All The Game Developers, You Guys Are Great Because You Guys Make Games And Games Are Life For Gamers And Stressbuster For The Working People. Thank You!- #LittleLycanOnky #January2017			",110,35,5,13,9,4,12

												I've bought this little game on sale and I'm really happy I did so, although there are places one can get this one for free nowadays. This game resembles death really with steering up. I've found a bit of problem with controlling the game through keyboards, but nothing major, I believe controller would do the job better with this game. The game is pleasant experience, with much humour, nice upgrades and challenging maps. It is probably even more fun at multiplayer. Highly recommend.Additional note to producer: one just doesn't put miss Wrench on calendar with the note ""don't screw me"" at Pegi 7 game, although I understand most children wouldn't get that reference.

												At first it feels like a polished game, but after about 30 minutes it becomes very repetitive, and also, pretty hard.Since the options are so limited you cant even change the sensitivity, it becomes a pain in the as, no pun intended (my name xD) when decent accuracy becomes required. The gameplay becomes too hard to quick, which makes it repetitive.Maybe there is a very refreshing and new aspect to the game later on, but I doubt that most players will reach it. It might do good as a app/ free to play, with a add after every game and certain microtransitions, but I would be lying If I said that this is worth 10 $.I bought this with 90% discount and thats how much I would reccomend anyone to pay for it. TL;DR: Becomes too hard too quick wich makes it repetitive, and has limited setting (locked sensitivity). Worth 1-2.5 $  ",38,7,0,1,2,0,5

Each level has four or five checkpoints, and when you pass them you are given a decent amount of pressure to keep your buggy running, as well as re-supplying your life bar.Multiplayer empty.The game's score and sound effects are as cartoonish. Graphics are standard at most, but detailed enough to perceive the damage you do.Pressure is fun game.			",222,38,9,29,13,1,16

												This is a combat driving game with quite well refined mechanics a a funny graphic style. The main campaign hold up very well till the very last stage, the medium difficulty offers a good challenge. Unfortunately it's not possible to re-play stages with better equipment, which reduces replaiability in my opinion. The controls are responsive and easy to use. Recomended to be bought but not at full price			",180,31,41,17,35,2,36

												This game is alot of fun!Pros:+Different Weapons Types (Assault, Rifle, and Shotgun)+Boosters+You can fail in other ways than just getting shot alot+You can upgrade and change you're cart and weapons.+Shooting and boosting don't take up ""pressure""Cons:-The game is just a re-modeled level over and over-Story line is lacking (  it is litteraly just that some guy stole you're water for his spa  )-There aren't any weapon attachments or anyway to improve other than upgrading-Can be very hard to shoot and make you're shots			",35,14,1,4,3,0,5

												A fairly good game. I'd advise playing it with a controller as its somewhat difficult to play with a keyboard and mouse. The mouse sensitivity is way too high and I've yet to find a way to change it. Other then that, its a good game with a somewhat childlike innocence to it. I'd reccomend it if you're looking for a fun way to kill some time.			",47,5,0,8,5,1,3

												At first it feels like a polished game, but after about 30 minutes it becomes very repetitive, and also, pretty hard.Since the options are so limited you cant even change the sensitivity, it becomes a pain in the as, no pun intended (my name xD) when decent accuracy becomes required. The gameplay becomes too hard to quick, which makes it repetitive.Maybe there is a very refreshing and new aspect to the game later on, but I doubt that most players will reach it. It might do good as a app/ free to play, with a add after every game and certain microtransitions, but I would be lying If I said that this is worth 10 $.I bought this with 90% discount and thats how much I would reccomend anyone to pay for it. TL;DR: Becomes too hard too quick wich makes it repetitive, and has limited setting (locked sensitivity). Worth 1-2.5 $  ",38,7,0,1,2,0,5
