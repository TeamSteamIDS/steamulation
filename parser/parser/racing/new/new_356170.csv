												Tile Rider puts you in control of a small car armed with nothing at first, but as the game progresses you unlock a Magnet, a weapon and a boost. You are thrown into a level which kinda resembles being a mouse hunting the cheese in the maze, the object is simple you have to solve puzzles in order to reach the finish line. Some levels mix up the gameplay by throwing races, escorts and chases. As well as trying to find out where the exit is, you have collectables to find in a level with some being tucked away corners and out of sight spots.At it's core the game reminds me of Micro Machines mixed with Robotwars and that's a fantastic thing, the levels and puzzles feel satisfying and not too challenging. There were some moments I did get confused and one or two times when the game actually felt too hard to me, you only get 4 lives per level it (some only give 1) and the checkpoints can be a bit far apart but the levels aren't long so replaying doesn't feel that bad.The game is only a couple hours long, but for the price I'd say it's definitely worth looking into if you're into puzzle games. I was very surprised, but smiled a couple times during the game because it has some nice elements (and even some game references - but I will not spoil those), my only hope is in the future they add some workshop support because I'd love to see levels created for this or even some deathmatch multiplayer!A nice fun way to spend a couple of hours, the price is just right for what you get.

Tile Rider is a puzzle game that seems very simple on the surface but is actually a very clever indie title.  Will this be enough to keep you captivated?  Let's find out in the Tile Rider review.In Tile Rider you control a small car where you get from point A to point B avoiding any obstacles and obstructions along the way.  It's easy enough at first, but the complexity quickly ramps up.  The game begins introducing moving boxes, teleports, buzz saws, and turret drones.  The puzzles have intelligent design as the game introduces you to a concept to get your feet wet and then begins to challenge you by significantly increasing the difficulty.   The game almost never stops throwing new mechanics at you which is why I can't go in depth in to any one puzzle in this review.  It requires you to actively solve problems on each level.  Each level even has a few bonus collectibles for the completionists out there.The game really begins to pick up when you get access to the magnetic grapple.  Now you have to move different elements while avoiding hazards and continuing to progress.  Levels are super short, you can beat each one in about a minute if you can grasp the puzzles.  This tends to make the game flow very fast and that's a good thing.  You start to crank out level after level without realizing just how much time has gone by.The graphics are simple shapes, colors, and gradients which is not exactly eye catching, but the game uses it well.  And it's refreshing to see a new concept other than pixel art.  Colors tend to act as separators, alerting you to new areas and challenges.   The music is a mix for fast tempo rock and electronic beats which keep you in the fast paced flow state of mind.  Although Tile Rider is simple, it comes together very well.  For a puzzle game fanatic, this can be a pretty addicting game, but it's not for everyone.  If you think the game looks cool you think you can jump into this type of gameplay, you might want to give Tile Rider a shot.  Subscribe to the Skilled Channel for more game reviews.

												I've just started playing, and am only several levels in, but since this game is new, I felt something should be said.Simply a REALLY fun, interesting, challenging game, especially for such a low price. I plan to revisit this review soon, but I strongly suggest getting this game.As interesting as the early levels are, I can only imagine the further levels are really challenging, but so much fun that even losing (as a normal part of the process) isn't really so bad. Each level adds really clever new features.The music in Tile Rider is absolutely TOP NOTCH. As well, it makes for some great Drive Any Track tunes, with full credit for each wonderful song (a welcome rarity for a game soundtrack.)For a game this price, one can hardly go wrong.

												Tile Rider is an isometric hybrid car game containing levels with different jobs to do, from racing to transporting cargo to shooting to driving to puzzling to a combination.  In some levels, you're not even a car.  Over twenty levels, from very easy to very challenging.  Some achievements will test you, but most of them are easy.  The graphics are smooth, the enemies are simple and well done, the levels are also simple yet fun to do.  Its a dynamic game that contains various playing elements and playing approaches.  I rarely felt bored because of how each level changed things up.Overall, fun and challenging at the same time, and well worth its price.			",1899,725,43,192,158,13,253

I nearly gave Tile Rider a positive review based on it's excellent technical execution alone, but there wasn't much that impressed me besides it. I found the gameplay and puzzles to be easy, bland and forgettable despite their wide variety. The look of the game and music also lacked any charm that may have helped made the game more memorable or engaging.Pros-No bugs found-Controls well-Clear tutorial-Wide Variety of puzzles and gameplayCons-Graphics are uninspired-Music is mind numbing-Gameplay is too easy-None of the wide variety of levels is particularily compellingDISCLAIMER: Review is based on approx. 1 hour of gameplay.
