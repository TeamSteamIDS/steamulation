								Really enjoyed the mechanic of this, once I got to grips with things. (Though I must admit it did take me a while to work out what was going on). Enjoyed grinding for the Super Robot cheesement think I will work on filling up that cheese bar as soon as I can. I'm looking forward to the multiplayer so I can play with friends.

			JOLT is a fast paced, racing party game. The game at its core is a competitive platformer that’s all about maintaining momentum with skillful navigation.		

Game was featured on my channel, now onto the review.Short Review:JOLT: Super Robot Racer is a quirky racing party game, its said a lot about these type of games but it is easy to learn and hard to master. While it is a fun ""SpeedRunners"" type game, at times it feels clunky which can be a good thing if you're not an avid gamer or it can throw you off if you're more experienced in the party racing genre. Simply put its a great game if you have guests over and want to play a game or two, but other than that it doesn't live up to what it could potentially be. I would love to have more fluid motion of characters, a menu after a game is finished instead of being sent to the main menu and perhaps an arrow pointing in the direction where we have to go (Although the confusion can be part of the fun).For $5 I say go for it. Buy it if you're gonna have some friends over. But until the online feature is available, which will be coming soon, I say maybe hold off on it or get it on sale.(Review subject to change as the game is still in EARLY ACCESS)			",484,168,10,56,55,7,57
