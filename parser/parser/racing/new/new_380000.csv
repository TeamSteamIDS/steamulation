Product received for free
												A nice little time-waster, especially for the kids. I'd say get this on sale, if you happen to find it.			",25,3,1,0,2,0,1

												Horrible micromachine rip off game. Don't bother, there's much better alternatives on steam that aren't a waste of your time, like Toybox Turbos.Get that instead, it's just a buck or more than this atrocity (during the summer sale) and well worth it.			",2189,854,88,271,225,28,361

												A fun throwback to games like Micro Machines and RC Pro Am. It controls pretty good with a keyboard and the mini cars and pickups are all in a real toy style. The tracks are very varied and richly detailed.I had fun playing this with little niece, if you have small kids (or are a kid at heart yourself of course!) this is a good purchase.There is no controller support built in but using a mapping tool works well, although as said the keyboard controls work fine for a casual top-down view racing game like this.

												I purchased this game for my son.  He loves racing games and this was the best one with easy keyboard/mouse controls and challenges to keep him happy for hours.  There was a problem with the game itself playing after purchase, but the developer responded to my forum post quickly and the issue was resolved within a couple of days.  I'm very happy with both the game and the company that produced it and I would recommend MiniOne Racing to others who want a racing game with simple controls, bright, colourful graphics, and a surprising amount of skill needed to get through some of the minigames.

First, let me say that this is not going to be one of those hahasofunnyrandomthumbsup review.REVIEWFrom time to time, I am blessed to stumble upon gems like this game. A quick peek at the options menu already shows you what to expect. Atrocious pixelated and bug riddled options, often without a label or a clear effect, empty drop-down menus. Oh boy, you are all in for some delicious treats with this one. MiniOne Racing, a top-down racing game with power-ups and toy cars and all that kind of good stuff. Probably nothing could go wrong here, right? WRONG. Not only does the camera angle destroy all sense of momentum, which is so oh so important for racing games... NO, additionally, and maybe even worse, the game as a power-up which randomly assigns a so called “master” who obtains a permanent lightning shield until the “master” is switched again. This lightning slows all others toy cars nearby. Infuriating. Not only does the game fail to have good controls, a sense of speed, nice graphics, bombastic sound, it also fails in enjoyable cart racing by including nonsensical, random items, which are so powerful that random chance might as well roll first place for you. Possible playing random cart racing on random.org might be more enjoyable than this.			",392,95,7,34,37,3,51
