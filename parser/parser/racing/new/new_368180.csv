Early Access Review
								Polyball captures the gameplay reminiscent of Super Monkey Ball quite well, and goes a step further by adding a jump mechanic which opens up a whole new avenue for interesting levels and challenges to give the player.Graphics:The game is gorgeous and has a nice minimalistic aesthetic going on about it. The world is made up of low-poly objects and solid colors with shading. It all comes together nicely to create a surprisingly pleasing atmosphere.There is a large amount of customization options for your ball that you can unlock with collectibles in the game, which change the ball's model, material, speed trail, and even a full chroma scale to pick your ball's colors from. These changes are purely aesthetic mind you, they have no bearing over actual gameplay.Sound:The music is pretty good in my opinion, ranging from high energy drum beats to chill electronic-style music. It fits in with the visual aesthetic quite well.Gameplay:I fully 100% recommend you play this game with a controller, you need access to a full stick to control the ball well.There are only two controls that affect your character, the ball. The left stick moves the ball around and the A button (on a 360 pad) jumps. The jump is what really separates this game from being a monkey ball clone gameplay wise, as now more interesting obstacles show up such as levels requiring precision platforming, or having to jump from one ramp to another at high speeds over a bottomless pit. It is hard to get used to but once you get a good grasp on how the movement works you can get to pretty high speeds and get a very nice sense of momentum, but this is reliant on your skill. There are also your fair share of high speed downhill slides that don't need jumping as well.Overall, this game takes an old idea and makes it fresh along with the great art direction. A fair warning though: this game gets very hard very fast. Be prepared to restart levels over and over again and get frustrated. However, the sense of satisfaction from beating a hard level drives you forward right into the next one.			",302,50,2,33,24,5,26

Disclaimer: Steam code was provided by developerCross Super Monkey Ball with the dream-like nature of Journey and you would end up with something very close to resembling Polyball. While it may seem focused on score and time based runs, it's also very relaxing just to roll about levels without a care in the world.

Gameplay involved collection of gems while progressing through each level. Gems are then spent on new customization options for your ball. These included a wide variety of new shapes, colours and particle effects (fire trails!). Currently Polyball contains 30 odd levels spread across 3 worlds, which might mean a more focused story mode in future, I'm not sure. Bunch of strange test levels were also included along with local multiplayer support. Reasonable soundtrack but it did get repetitive. Controls were responsive though I would recommend a gamepad. If you suffer from motion sickness you won't have issues with this game, included are options for tweaking fov/dof/cameratilt and more. Most of my problems with the game are minor or planned additions and tweaks for future (free) content. Several patches dropped since launch and developer seems quite active and open to feedback. Don't see much resemblance to Mario Kart but I've enjoyed my time spent with the game and quite excited to see it develop further. With a level editor and workshop support coming, I think it has a bright future. Perfect example of something that slipped through the kickstarter net and came out the other end with some great results. Worth keeping on your shortlist, even just for Zen purposes. Cheers folks.

Early Access Review
								I have very mixed feelings about this game. I feel overall, that this game is not worth buying as of July 24th, over a single con. Let's go over the pros first.PROS: Aesthetically pretty, at least in the early levels (I'll talk about this more in the cons), Low-poly art style is very underrated. Controls are decent, after some updates were released which tuned the handling. Developer listens and makes changes due to feedback.The gameplay is pretty basic, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Nothing here is original, yet what's here is all pretty solid in quality, until you move on to one thing: the level design. The level design is pretty average at worst in the first chapter, nothing to complain about, but chapter two and on feels like a kid went crazy with the Halo forge level editor. If you told me the dev's kid took over the level design for chapter 2, I'd believe it. Lazy floating platforms, frustrating jumps with no rhyme or reason, hilariously bad looking misaligned platforms on bank turns, lazy copy pasting everywhere, and maybe worse of all, absolutely abysmal readability. The lava/volcano themed levels are a nightmare to navigate in some levels. The background is brown, and every platform is brown. Make the platforms literally any other brighter color and it would have better readability than what it is now. So con-wise:CONS: Absolutely mediocre level design after Chapter 1. It blatantly feels like they just pumped out some levels over a weekend just to make the game longer. Menus are pretty clunky, but have been slowly improving through updates.Please polish that lava chapter, this game has potential to be a solid game. ",273,47,7,32,29,4,21

Early Access Review
								Dark Souls + Super Monkey Ball = PolyballThis game takes a good hard look at the ball rolling games of yore and puts a subtle, dark, (and oddly self aware) spin into the genre.  Firstly, the music is really well done.  Ranging from beats and speed to chill and focus, the electronica sounds do a good job of complimenting both level design and gameplay.  The levels themselves are beautifully designed, dripping with atmosphere and scale that really lends to itself as you progress through the story. I had as much fun exploring the levels as I did actually playing them, that said, this game is pretty unforgiving.  Prepare to use that back button cause youre gonna be restarting alot, and its not a bad thing!  Ball customization is pretty cool too if youre into that stuff. I made a pooball.  As expected with early access games it is not without issues, albeit they are pretty small: UI navigation, mising level thumbnails, etc.  However it shouldnt turn you away from the game itself. There's a really solid art direction and game mechanic here.  I cant wait to see more.PS Holy ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ space levels			",94,15,1,7,9,0,15

Early Access Review
 This key was obtained from the developer for the purposes of review. Note this review was done during early access, so it's based on the current implementation. Summary: Marble Madness plus Super Monkey Ball with a hint of Sonic in it. In this Early Access game, the solid controls allows you to pick up speed with the great movement system that feels natural. In addition, the level design is great: it teaches good lessons of what you need to learn to master the environments in question. Camera design is well done, and frankly everything flows together rather nicely.  The gameplay is good: although it's going to hit a very niche market in question, and won't hit the mainstream in terms of playability.  It needs the bell and whistles to take it to the next levels, as additional controls or options for gameplay will really make it stand out. Early Access games are always ones I have to say: ok, hold on a second, wait till its released: but Polyball when fully completed looks like a game that will be worth your time for old 3D platformer fans, but surprisingly racing fans a bit as well.

 Lists: +: Core gameplay is solid. Movement is in the right spot in both fast/slow speeds as well as on angles and different landscapes. Good level design all over the place. In particular, the levels back to back teach great lessons of movement while challenging you on the next section. Good mixture of fianesse and speed elements of stages to take advantage of everything the game has to offer.  Collectables are worth grabbing for customization elements and provide challenge in getting trophies. Camera controls feel right. Good rotation without being too sensitive, and the ability to snap behind the ball is appreciated. Really Really works with the Steam Controller, but works for the keyboard and mouse as well as the 360 controller as well. Surprisingly unbuggy for an Early Access release. There was an issue here and there of course, but nothing substantial of any sort or anything that really hindered gameplay in the end. -: Graphics are rough around the edges. In particular, several choices with the simple styles in particular with colors and how it hurts the eyesight.  Needs the shine around the edges. Core is great, but what will bring the game to the next level is the little touches, like new gameplay options, etc. Player Guidance mechanics are missing, as you'll get lost at times, or be put into situations where it seems to go against the opposite of normal gameplay logic. While there's reasonable content here, it just will do better to have more in the long run. ",529,87,7,50,31,6,50

Early Access Review
								Polyball is a momentum-based precision platformer with a focus on ""Goin Fast"". The game is beautifully minimalist in design, controls, and visuals. I play using a controller, and the movement feels extremely tight and satisfying, especially when going near top speed. You are given the controls of movement (acceleration), and a single jump. With limited controls, the mechanics don't run especially deep, but mastering the momentum control required for later levels, or to compete for top times, can present a worthy challenge for even experienced players of momentum platformers. Fans of these games will also appreciate the quick restart button for endless resets in the quest for the perfect IL run. With online leaderboards, you can race against anyone's ""ghost"" and see how they complete the level. There is also talk of a replay system, but nothing solid as of yet. It should also be mentioned that the developers are extremely responsive on the forums, so many of the early-access kinks are being smoothed quickly.Since it is early access there is a fairly small selection of maps (sectors) to choose from - 30 in total. These levels progress from easy/beginner to some considerably difficult maps towards the later levels (with some crossing the line into ""tedious""). I personally feel as though there are more difficult maps that require precise movement than necessary. I would like to see more levels in the easy-to-medium category that allow for a focus on optimization, rather than not dying. There are currently a few packs of unreleased maps which will be coming out soon, so hopefully this comment will no longer be relevant at that time.Overall I would definitely reccomend this game to anyone on the fence, or anyone that is interested in the genre.

								+ Graphics : unique, simple and beautiful + Gameplay : simple , you controll a ball from point A to point B and try not to fall or slow down , the first levels are pretty easy but after that it gets really hard . Oh and you can also JUMP!+ Soundtrack : descent nothing special about it+ Customization : You can customize the ball by changing the colour or the shape but of course changing the shape of the ball dosen't change the gameplay it's just for visuals.+ Full controller support- At the moment there is 30 levels + extra levels but only 3 of them have a finish point , the others are just there for you to test but nothing to do. Now 30 levels sounds a lot but i did them in 5H39M but of course it depends on your kind of skills and also the way you play the game. If you want to get that Gold Time then you can add a couple of hours or maybe more because there is some levels where its almost impossible for me to achieve the best score. I am not sure but i think there was a possibility to try and test some none finished levels but at the moment of me writing the review it's not possible. - No local coop or multiplayer yet- No achievements yet ",125,32,4,21,9,3,14

								This game is addicting. I have to wake up in four hours, but I just can't stop.Update August 18, 2015:Polyball is a great indie game because it has an attention to detail and yet it's remarkably simple. I thoroughly enjoy the lack of cookie-cutter scenery (every level is unique). The ball itself seems more of a polyhedron than an actual sphere, but I find it rather endearing. The racing element is absorbing, I find myself trying to top other players' ghost replays hundreds of times on a single level. This game truly brings out the trial and error spirit in me, and I can't say many games do that. If you are looking for a simplistic, yet highly responsive racing game that doesn't have to be about cars, race tracks, steering wheels, or crashing then you are currently on the right page. Studio Monolith has a great game in the making and its name is Polyball. 10/10			",121,8,10,15,14,0,12

Definitely worth checking outAs someone who was formerly addicted to Super Monkey Ball and speed-running courses on Sonic Adventure 2 Battle, I think this game will probably evoke some sort of nostalgia and/or strongly remind you of why you had so much fun playing those kinds of games in the first place.A worthwhile mention is that the graphics are pretty top notch in the realm of this minimalist style. If you can make geometry and simple colors look surreal, your artists are doing something notably right.Having played an earlier build of it prior to the Steam Store release (and getting really into it at that point in this game's lifecycle), seeing as there have been vast amounts of improvements and tons of positive feedback from the community, I'd say you can be sure to enjoy a very solid experience with this homage to arcade-style platforming.

								Early Access review.I can hear the Devs:  ""Let's just make an environment and let physics dictate the game play, it'll be easy!""  I think they bit off more than they can chew.The trailer to this game looks like a blast, however, I'm having a hard time finding that kind of fun in the game itself.  You start off with a hand full of levels that are just move forward to win, then suddenly you're on a track where if you fall off you might as well just reset because you are going to find the world's edge before you find the proper goal.  Odd that it's not insta death like the other levels.Try racing, okay.  Hold down the go button and run in a circle for 3 laps.  The winner will be decided by whoever pressed the go button first.  Finding shortcuts would be a plus, but apparently the dev thought that should be against the rules and put up invisible walls and death pits everywhere.  There's no real real reward for playing ""well"", but there is capital punishment for making a mistake.Battle mode.  Players actually swing at each other with weapons?  That's hilarious, but not at all practical.In summary, there are promising features in this game, but they are a long way off from being properly implemented.  There are many many levels and lots of content to this game, but I played for 2 hours and didn't find anything that actually felt polished.  The majority of it felt like it was barely functioning.  Given that they're asking $16 for this it's pretty disappointing.  If the devs actually had 2 or 3 levels nearly polished for fun gameplay, and cranked the price down to match the content available, I'd be writing a positive review here.			",777,396,17,104,74,6,111

Early Access Review
								A classic concept reincarnated and embellished with the power of super, spinning, wild balls! Yep, they are wild and out of control!I've only played a small part of the game, yet one thing is clear: it's more challenging than it looks. The physics part of it is a bit exaggerated, but it adds to the fun in my opinion. The game requires a lot of strategic thinking and trial and error in order to find the most sufficient way. Pressing forward increases the ball's speed and so do slopes, most probably, so that's another factor one has to keep in mind. I liked the fact that even if you couldn't get a nice score you could still proceed to the next level and try something else. It's very thoughtful and it makes casual play a bit more convenient. However, the game also reinforces the hard-workers by adding their name to the leader board.I encountered a few difficulties, namely camera controlling (sometimes it went below the ground or was inconvenient) and sensitivity was too high at first (I'd recommend a lower general sensitivity to begin with, but it might have just been me). However, the gameplay as a whole was very entertaining and ""complete"" taking in account it's an early access game. I wish  games of this category would take lessons from Polyball and strive for more and better content for their early access builds.Finally, there is a customization system for your ball. I really enjoyed checking it and I can't wait for future updates!Keep up the good work, devs!P.S. Here's my gameplay of the game..

Early Access Review
								Polyball is a fun little early access title that brings back great memories of playing the Super Monkey Ball games as a kid. I still go back to playing those games often (with SMB 2 being my favorite!) through the excellent Dolphin Gamecube emulator, so as a result I’ve become pretty familiar with what makes SMB such a great title. The controls, the physics, level design and charm all add up to create a phenomenal gaming experience. Polyball was obviously inspired by Super Monkey Ball, but  isn't  Super Monkey Ball. It doesn't try to be and instead tries to be its own thing.As a result, we get a great platformer that breaks free from the classic gameplay elements of its inspiration. For one, you can jump (which was a concept implemented in the underrated Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz but not found in the classic SMB games), and the level design is completely based around this. There are plenty of platforming challenges sprinkled throughout the levels, but the game's medal system still encourages you to race to the finish. The levels are also much bigger than that of Super Monkey Ball's, and can sometimes take upwards of 2 minutes to complete. While this might annoy some players who enjoy going for good times on the leaderboards, I was personally fine with this decision. The levels are fun as well, and similar to the SMB games they are fun to replay over and over again. The physics aren't perfect, but are generally really tight and make for fun gameplay. The devs can obviously refine the physics over the course of development so I’m sure they’ll improve. The controls are also tight and responsive, which is absolutely key for a game like this. If the controls weren't good then the game wouldn’t be fun to play and thus be completely ruined. Lastly, SMB's charm is replaced by a striking art style and minimalistic design principles. I personally love this and find that it makes the game even more enjoyable. All in all, Polyball is shaping out to be a great game and I'd say this is one to keep your eye on if you were are looking for a game similar to Super Monkey Ball. I’ve enjoyed my time with it and look forward to the updates down the road.			",585,119,19,96,67,8,155

Early Access Review
								Polyball is a breathtaking graphical experience it may seem quite simple on the outside from a far but in game it is very much an immersive experience about a ball trying to reach a goal through various beautiful environments.At 1st you might look at Polyball as just another clone in the ball rolling / monkey ball genre but it so much more than that. Polyball offers diverse explorable landscapes with secrets to find and atmosphere by the bucketload.The music is soothing and well suited for the playstyle, there is very little in terms of sound effects but what there is works fine and it's not really a game where sound effects will make the experience any better.Gameplay is its best feature there are multiple worlds with 10 courses each and while in early access still expanding and extending in length. With leaderboards and a marathon mode there is enough there to keep you attempting for hours to try and take the no1 spot if you dare. Leaderboards are split into time and score, time is the major factor in the game whereas score feels a bit underdeveloped you might play a level for score once but time you could play each level 100’s of times to whittle down them milliseconds for the best time.With multiplayer incoming it is very much the pinnacle of the genre for the pc, don't look anywhere else if you are a veteran in this style of game you will find everything you ever wanted right here.The biggest problem with the game is that it can be quite heavy on the computing power so if ur running a system from a few years back you might have some issues with framerate etc. I assume this factor is down to the unity engine and if other unity games work for you go ahead and get this it is brilliant!

Early Access Review
								I bought this game to play with friends. Unfortunately the multiplayer is completely broken and therefore unplayable. The game itself isn't optimised either. I have an Acer Predator gaming computer and only 18 fps on fullscreen with the lowest settings possible (!).I don't recommend the game at all at this point in time, but I unterstand that it is still an early access and that it has time to improve. I hope that I can come back in a few months and rewrite this review and change it to a positive one.			",19,4,1,0,7,0,4

								Liking the range of camera zoom in Polyball, you can pull the camera out til you see the entire level and it keeps a solid framerate the whole time. The motion of the ball has a nice weight to it that makes you develop a skill for timing your movements just right to get to the end goal in as little time as possible. Environment rendering and lighting is great too, with the low-poly aesthetic and DOF this is a really unique looking game. Dig it!			",365,44,2,39,17,1,24

								I bought the game on a whim after seeing it and thinking back to the fun I had playing marble madness, super monkey ball, etc etc. Personally, I like the grindy '0.01 faster each time' type of game, similar to bhop, trackmania, or other racing games. The game's intrinsic simplicity means that you can't really go wrong with it if you like the non-realism oriented side of the racing genre. It's still in early access, but there do appear to be updates every once in a while, so it's not abandoned or anything. Overall the game isn't perfect, such as it lacks some polish. However the gameplay isn't hindered by this whatsoever. The leaderboards mean there's plenty of competition, and while there is technically multiplayer, it's not really a thing yet. If the preview videos and reviews make it look like it's something you would enjoy, it probably is. It's a straightforward game, and I praise it for that. However, maybe wait until it's on sale. $15 might be a bit much for it.			",52,8,10,5,14,0,2

								Great game! The levels are very fun from the high speed, curves, far jumps, and smooth landings, and challenging from the precision platforming. The visuals are also pleasing; I really like how certain level elements glow brightly and contrast with the path. I have not been able to play multiplayer yet, since it is being reworked, but I'm sure that it will also be a blast. I've been missing a game like this since I played Marble Blast Ultra years back.

Early Access Review
								Polyball is one of only 3 early access games I own. I haven’t purchased them consciously, they were just parts of bundles that contained other games I was genuinely interested in. But Polyball immediately caught my eye in its particular bundle because of its charming art style, so I figured I’d give it a shot, even though I expected that it would still be somewhat unfinished.This is incidentally the reason why I usually don’t buy or play early access games: I pay for an unfinished product that I get to play in an objectively worse condition than the actual release build. The other reason for not buying early is, obviously, that a final release build is far from guaranteed, as we’ve seen with a couple of abandoned games now, and the slew of early access titles who seem to stay in early access for years to come. But enough ranting about the business model, you’re here to know if the game in its current state is any good. As the developer claims, Polyball is a rather simple ball rolling game in the vein of other classic ball rolling games, such as Super Monkey Ball. The objective in each level is to find the end goal while overcoming a variety of obstacles, and that’s basically it. You can also collect shards, which are used to customize your ball in a variety of cosmetic ways. But there are no micro-transactions to unlock this stuff, which is nice. But in the end, the game tracks your time, and gathering all the shards seems like it’d only increase your time spent in the level. This is only exacerbated by the fact that apparently there’s a trophy hidden in all the levels and I barely managed to find one, so there is a bit of a mixed message going on.Like I mentioned above, the art style is what drew me into it at first, and throughout the game, the environments you get to play in really manage to create a sense of atmosphere. This is obviously helped by the wide variety of levels that are already accessible in this early access version, with promises of more on the way. The music underlines the general aesthetic as well, going for a lot of synthwave, which fits the general visual tone of the game quite nicely. If there’s one thing I can criticize, it’s the controls. They’re not awful, but at times they seem a tad unresponsive. Given that you can also change your trajectory mid-air, you are allowed a lot of control over your sphere, however the jump mechanic needs some work in my estimation. The biggest problem I see with it is the fact that you can only jump when the ball is in contact with the ground on the bottom part of the ball. So say your ball is perched between two ledges on the left and right side, you can’t jump, because the bottom part of the ball isn’t touching anything. The same thing goes for certain very steep sections where you can do nothing but watch as your ball loses momentum and slides back down again. This was particularly infuriating in one of the levels where around 70% of the time I lacked momentum to clear that particular wall and couldn’t continue with the level because of that.In addition to that, I feel that the tolerance between what counts as touching and not touching is exceptionally slim. Visually it could appear that the ball is touching the ground, but the physics calculation in the game actually tells you it isn’t, which is why at times the ball seems to completely ignore your input and refuses to jump. If I may be so bold as to suggest a fix for this, I’d say make the collision box slightly bigger than the ball to allow for some margin of error on behalf of the player. It can get quite frustrating after a while if it seems like you’re losing control of the ball for no apparent reason.Other than that, I’d say definitely had fun playing this game, even though again, it is still in a somewhat unfinished state. The developer claims that the game will feature a bunch more levels upon release, as well as local multiplayer, and the game will be Steam Workshop enabled, which could benefit the longevity of the title. But even in the state it’s in, it’s a nice little title. The only thing I’m a bit dubious about is the price. $15 for a game about rolling around a ball seems like quite a lot to me. If you’re the competitive type and you want to see your name on the leaderboards, you’ll invest plenty of time into the game to justify the investment. But if you’re like me and you just want a bit of challenge without going crazy over shaving off a few more milliseconds, in its current state, you can expect around 4 hours of entertainment. If that’s good enough for you, go for it, it’s one of the very few titles I’d say deserves to be in early access because it’s in a playable and almost finished state and from the looks of it, all the mechanics are in place, so only a few levels and the multiplayer portion are still missing.

Early Access Review
								Polyball is another ambitious entry into the ""rolling ball"" subgenre of platforming games. If you've played MarbleBlast or Marble Madness then you should already know what to expect.I understand that this game is still in Early Access, so I already anticipated there being some problems, but it's in a lot worse shape that I imagined. That being said I'm going to list through all of the problems I've experienced. But for the record, my experience with the current state of this game overall has been frustrating.Before I go into the game related problems I had a number of problems with just booting the game up. Everytime I load up the game my connection to steam is always interrupted briefly, which I believe to be a glitch with Polyball's online capabilities. When the game finishes loading there is also a 50/50 that the interface is completed bugged out and I cannot click on any of the menu items at all, so my chances of even being able to play the game are cut in half every time I load it up.The ball control and camera movement are terrible; the camera slips around every which way as if it has ice physics programmed into it, making re-orienting yourself in the right direction nauseating and confusing. The ball control is also very stiff and has trouble responding at times, especially during platforming segments. The ball accelerates very quickly but takes too long to slow down, which poses as a problem when you get to parts of the level where you need to be a little more careful with moving around. The cornering/turning of the ball is also very lacking, which is a problem in of itself when you need to make sharp turns, but instead you end up colliding into a wall or object and losing your top speed completely.While the game concept was inspired by MarbleBlast and Marble Madness, what this game reminds me of the most is Sanic Ball, a rolling ball game that was very clearly made as a joke, but it's frightening how much this game resembles that. The levels mostly focus on speed and racing (which I'd like to mention, is not a bad quality), the ball controls poorly, and it's difficult to figure out where you're supposed to go because there's no boundaries or signs pointing you in the right direction, like any game of this design should have.Now the levels do have it's faults, but I do like the idea of racing through vast, open environments at top speed while zooming through smooth slopes and ramps, but I wish the game kept it that way consistently. In between all of the slick, speedy levels are what I refer to as ""TIGHTROPE"" levels, a term coined after MarbleBlast Gold's infamous level of the same name. These are levels whose main gimmick is moving along uncomfortably thin platforms and keeping your ball/marble perfectly balanced upon it. Usually if you fall off (which is very frequent) your time is either slowed down considerably, or you just die. This is where the ball control & camera problems really start to become apparent because one: You need to keep the camera at a consistent direction or your ball will start to slip off, but given how slippery the camera control is keeping the view consistent is a feat and a half. Two: The ball, once again, controls badly. As mentioned before the ball has problems slowing down, so when you're approaching a turn on a tightrope platform you need to hit the breaks and stop your marble from rolling any further or else it falls off, but because the slow down is so painstakingly gradual the ball still tips off the edge. It's very clear that the ball was programmed for high speed racing on long strips of ground, so putting levels of this design makes absolutely no sense. These tightrope levels need to be SCRAPPED before the game leaves Early Access, no questions asked. Put more focus on speed and racing, and less focus on tedious precision movements.Now other than the speed and tightrope levels the only kinds of levels that are left are what I can only assume to be unfinished test levels because if it's not focusing on speed or tedious balancing acts then all the levels are are generic flat areas with a bunch of singular jumps everywhere. I believe this to be a recurring theme because there seem to be a lot of levels centered around making singular jumps between thin pillar-like structures, and it gets old really fast and it makes me wish there were more speed levels just so I could at least have fun zooming around at top velocity.The only thing left I've had problems with are the medal times, which I believe are likely placeholder times that will get fixed as more updates are pushed. However in the event that these are the final medal times, then these NEED to be fixed. Not only do they command harsh requirements that a player who is not a full-blown expert would struggle greatly with, but they are NEEDED in unlocking more levels. This is a big mistep that makes it a problem for newcomers to make any amount of progress in the game. My suggestion for this is to either make the medal times more accessible to all players, or make it NOT required to unlock more levels; either one or the other, but it should not be both. The end of the level stats are a nice punch in the face too; being told you're ""TOO SLOW"" and earning ""NOTHING,"" especially in the levels that require a lot of precision movement rather than speed, is just in poor taste.Look, this game has incredible potential and I want to see it succeed because Rolling Ball games are some of my absolute favorite games to play, but there are a lot of fundamental elements that NEED to be fixed before it can proceed onto that path. It's possible that some, if not most, of these problems I mentioned are already acknowledged and being looked at. I can assure you when this game sees improvement by the time it's officially released I will make an entirely new review reflecting that.			",24,16,0,2,4,0,6

								Beautiful and fun game. You have good control over the ball, but the physics feel natural as well. There is a surprisingly large amount of area per level- several times I've fallen from a cliff or into a huge lake and found myself not-dead and still able to somehow get back/explore. There's a load of customization options as well, with skins not costing too many shards (which you naturally pick up as you're playing the levels) and colors are open from the start.I love that there's a collectible trophy in each level, it remind me of old school collect-a-thon games and needing that very last coin/gem in the whole level.Certainly a game to pick up!

								Enjoy a good game of Monkeyball but, alas, it isnt on steam. Bought this game instead and have so far enjoyed the experience. Smooth gameplay, nice level design, decent amount of levels and global leaderboards. Woop! Unfortunately the leaderboards seem to be broken on some levels where players have ""finished"" in 0 seconds, appearing to randomly glitch through the map and sometimes my record times aren't updated. Hopefully the devs will be fixing this in later builds. On the whole this is a very well designed game with nice gameplay, art and music! The game plays alot better with gamepad, K+M feels too jolty (for me) for a ball rolling game.			",129,37,3,16,12,3,24

								I wanted Marble Blast Ultra with some things to make it its own. It's not that, but it's decently fun. The physics are good and the aesthetics/music are very well done. That said, the level design is bad. Real bad. The first world is legitimately great, with sprawling levels that have just enough linearity to have purpose and just enough space to foster exploration. People are complaining about the second world a lot, and they're correct, but the problem doesn't really go away. Yes, the bloom in the second world is such that you can't see platforms. And thus far, it is definitely the worst world I've seen (though I've only seen three so far). However, world three has many of the same problems. Platforms that are tiny, a wonky camera and environments that stifle progress,An example: An early level in world three (er, two in the game) has you navigating tiny platforms along a cliffside. The platforms are so small that even a slightly mistimed jump means you're rolling into a pit (that doesn't kill you). Even worse, the cliffside juts out from the side in many areas. This means that on some platforms, if you jump straight up, you'll get knocked to the side and off the platform. It's either an oversight or an attempt to make the game longer. It's just bad.I am making this a positive review because despite everything it is still somewhat fun. The devs are pretty active and I believe them when they say Workshop support is coming. When that drops, the game may become a must buy for user-created levels.Verdict: If you want a simple rolling physics game with some quirks and no originality, pick this game up, play it for a week and forget about it until Workshop comes along.

								Another take on runner genre - a physics-based golf ball roller. Here you can: 1) beat time scores and make it to world top; 2) strike some stones hovering in intricate patterns for high score & beating the lvls this way; 3) just roll around polygonal landscapes for fun. The levels are spacious and you are not handheld, so it's really a nice stress reliever. In one level you can start off from the actual playground to the sea on the horison and arrive there after rolling downhill for about 10 kilometers or so. Then you fall from a texture's edge right into a dark abyss! Recommendation for the feeling of freedom so rarely met in physics arcades and puzzles.Другой подход к жанру бегунка - катание мячика для гольфа на основе физической модели. Здесь можно: 1) кататься на скорость и стать самым быстрым в мире; 2) собирать парящие камни по замысловатым траекториям, набивая счет и проходя этапы за счет этого; 3) просто кувыркаться по полигональным пейзажам не пярясь. Уровни обширны и никто не контролирует наше поведение, этим можно пользоваться для снятия стресса. На одном из уровней можно укатить прочь от площадки с бонусами вниз по склону километров на 10 по направлению к морю. И свалиться с края текстур прямо в темную бездну! В общем, рекомендую за чувство свободы столь редкое в жанре физических аркад и головоломок.			",1420,573,53,157,157,19,229

								Good god I have some stuff to say about this great game.Polyball is a large game with a wide variety of levels to play, has leaderboards, and has amazing devs/managers that actually care about their game!Now the gameplay.The controls are very easy to pick up and the difficulty slowly picks up after each world!There are plenty of trophies also hidden throughout the MASSIVE world you have to explore, even if some of it is just a wide field of nothingness. The trophies are cleverly hidden throughout these levels, or placed off the beaten path for extra challenge.The ILs are where it gets really out of hand with glitching, though, but it'll be fixed soon, and I'll update this review as soon as it's fixed.There are also plenty of extra levels to dabble into if you wanna see what the devs made to mess around in their own engine.

								Very fun game, levels have different themes which keeps them interesting. Very pretty game as well, in love with the amazing poly style and all the levels will amaze you with the visuals alone. Level design is amazing on some levels, just okay on others, you will find yourself dodging and weaving through tight spaces and dodging all sorts of objects while competing with a time limit. The only drawback i found about this game thusfar was that the difficulty of the levels increases pretty fast without a gradual transition. Everything is quite easy until platforms are introduced and it becomes rage inducing, but also rewarding once they are completed.All in all, good game, super fun if you are a fan of the super monkey ball games, and definately worth a play to see the awesome level design and poly style :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Supremely frustrating. Because there are no checkpoints, and the levels are forced to be unlocked in a sequential order, you may be stuck repeating the same level (from the very beginning!) fifty times in a row before you're able to move on to the next. I guess that counts as replay value? I know that I had to play the level where I'd roll across an incredibly narrow path surrounded by LAVA maybe two dozen times. And why is the camera completely controllable in the y-axis? The computer controlled camera is crappy enough to warrant turning it off completely and just using the second stick on a controller to move the camera around, but under what circumstances do I need to see the ball from UNDERNEATH the track? The camera stick has complete control here, but that's not helpful in real life. What would be nice would be if pushing R3 would ""right"" the camera to point in the same vector as the ball's velocity. An arrow pointing to the destination would be nice, or at least, pointing to the next crystal-thing. Pushing any buttons on a standard gamepad makes a distracting cursor appear on the screen - I couldn't see how it'd even be possible to play ANY game like this without a gamepad for analogue input. (It might be a fault of the engine or some other thing, but it's worth noting). The graphics are wonderful and the concept is golden, but I feel like it needs a little bit more polish if it's to overcome the critical two-hour make or break point that Valve has now forced indie games to compete on. It's 90 percent of the way there, I feel like.			",27,14,0,1,1,0,1

								Best ball game I've played on steam. It has 50+ levels and more to be released. Some levels need tweaking but the majority of them are well done and fun to play. Devs are open to ideas and I'm looking forward to new levels and current ones being changed around as well as the multiplayer to be released.All around a lot of fun to play and grind leaderboard times can't wait for the full release :)			",98,25,1,4,5,1,4

								First off, the game is absolutely gorgeous. The minimalist, low poly aesthetic works great here. It's also incredibly frustrating at times, but in a fun way, I guess. I pretty quickly found myself reflexively mashing the suicide/restart button at the first hint of a bad run. There's a lot more platforming here than I would have expected. I can't say I'm terribly familiar with these kind of ball rolling games (I think my last one was Marble Mania or something on the Wii), but here your ball is surprisingly agile. It's immensely satisfying to navigate through a precariously platforming section without sacrificing too much of your momentum. I still haven't checked out the multiplayer or any of the skins, but I've found plenty to enjoy so far. I'd say it's probably worth a go in it's current state, especially if you're already a fan of the genre, or enjoy racing through levels again and again for better times. And, of course, here's a video we did of the game where we found a bug that made the first level temporarily un-winnable (the devs told me they've fixed it, since. :P).

								June 21, 2016: The game seems very abandoned and it's a shame. I hope the devs still plans on developing it.I liked it. I asked a refund because the game still have some issues to run on my pc. I might look forward the final release.Levels feels extremely bland sometimes though.I purchased the game again and I feel like I should add more details to my review. The game itself is awesome, I really like the artstyle (which represents polygons very well with a creative environment and beautiful color palette). There's only few optimizations issues with the menu and texts but that's it, no major gameplay bugs.Pros:-Monkey Ball/Marble on PC! -Beautiful landscapes & color palette-Many balls variants (Including bonus ones such as a ragdoll or a car)-Highly customizable (You can add effects and textures to your balls such as fire, ghost, metal, glow, plastic, flashy..) You can create 8 different balls-Adaptable settings, there's many options to edit the camera and gameplay (Field of view, camera tilt which is the ""Monkey Ball"" effect, No smoothing, Ghost replays options..)-Challenging story mode with unique levels and a great lifetime, seems to have 6 worlds with approximately 10 stages each.-Good soundtrack, reminds me of Marble Blast Ultra a lotCons:-No online servers-You can't play local multiplayer with a keyboard. you NEED to use controllers -The devs seems to put their efforts in online modes-Needs few text and menu optimizations -What are the extra levels supposed to be? (other than circuits)-Even if the soundtrack is great, it' s really short. It should change by environment instead of by world.-Devs should work more on trials/obstacles rather than spending their times on circuits and open world landscapes			",458,94,4,31,48,5,30

								Absolutely great and promising game, the developer is also active on the forums and already as it is,  the game is beautiful and addicting. Showed it to a friend of mine and a second after I found myself without a controller in my hands and writing this review meanwhile two of my friends are challenging each other in split screen. Hope the development continues flawlessly, as of now I highly doubt I'll ever regret buying this. Steam workshop is coming the developer said! Cannot wait to see what people will create. Nonetheless a bit of polishing and optimization is definitely needed as my powerful pc that handles games like witcher3 almost all maxed out sometimes struggles with this, but I have faith in the development.

								NOTE: When I first played the game I never changed the resolution from 1920x1080 so my first review of this is a little misguided since I never tried a lower resolution. sorry about that; however I do believe it was not fully optimized considering the laptop I played on could handle alot more intense games.*EDIT* The developerson this game are awesome after I saw teacoats(developer) reply to my comment, saying that the game has been optimized better, I got the game again. I was not decieved it felt alot more smooth even on 1920x1080; however on that high of resolution it still felt slightly slow but still worlds better than before. I played on 1280x720 resolution and did not notice any frame problems; however, it seem darker than at 1080 I don't know if that is intentional to help the game run smoother or it was a mistake; it did not bother me and it was still playable it was just a little odd at first and I was just a little curious since I am planning to go to school in game development I like to understand things better. The game is alot better and I am very excited to know how it improves between now and full release; if there were more settings so that you could customize your settings it would be a lot better but right now I definetly recommend this game not only because the problem was fixed but because the developers are listening to us (the customers buying the game) and are actually working on the game to make it better unlike some early access games where you never hear from developers. Thank you for reading this review and if the developers are reading this, thank you for being the kind of developers that are using early access the right way and not just trying to shovel out a broken game to get money. tldr: The game is alot better optimized and the developers are really awesome///////////////////////////////////////ORIGINAL REVIEW////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////*THIS IS NEGATIVE BECAUSE THE GAME HAS LOW FRAMERATE, NOT BECUASE IT IS BAD*The game is a very good idea; however, it is poorly executed. The framerate is way too low. and the graphic settings are very lacking; My computer may not be the best, but it can play GTA V fairly well. I hope it gets optimized better because I really wanted to enjoy it. It reminded me of Monkey Ball (Which I loved) I might try to buy it again when it is out of early access or until these framerate problems are fixed. I wish the developers luck with the game and hope to be able to enjoy it soon.			",137,34,6,11,20,2,6

								Even in Early Access, Polyball is still a really fun ball-rolling game! The main focus is the Marble Blast gameplay, and it's solidly executed. The controls felt tight, whether you choose keyboard or controller. Because of how unique the gameplay is, the controls take some getting used to, but it's satisfying to blast through a stage once you have the hang of it. Another great addition are the leaderboards. After every stage there is a list of times, and it really increases the replayability when you try to get your name among the top 10. The developers are actively asking players for input, so you can expect for this game to have more levels, more customizations, and hopefully more modes. As it is, I highly recommend giving this game a shot if you're familiar with other ball-rolling games.			",211,56,8,34,31,2,25

								As a fan of Ball games, Polyball is up in my favourites.Polyball is a lot like other ball games in the sense that you roll a ball around a maze-like or challenging environment to reach an end goal but also gives more challenge with the Leaderboards, Medals, Ghosts and hidden collectables in each level.The game has over 50 levels already, is still in Early Access, and the devs are open to feedback from the community which means this game can only get better from here.

Early Access Review
								Intro TL;DR: Polyball is a marble rolling game in a low-poly artstyle with many features where features and exploration are strong, but the gameplay itself is not as deep as others like Marble Blast. Got this game as a key from the developer. Since I have not completed all the game, I also must inform that I've only completed worlds 0-2 (3). This review will be updated as I play more.Gameplay: Best: 7.5, Worst: 4, Innovation: 2 [Mechanics] Solid but not special. Unlike other games in the genre like Marble Blast, there are very few special mechanics, let alone unique mechanics in this game. If you are looking for a game in this genre that's new and unique, you won't get it here. The mechanics besides basic jumping and moving, as far as I've played: instant death, ""balance"" platforms, booster pads, jump pads. [Design] The game's design can be split into the couple worlds it has right now as well as misc. design. Overall, it's fluctuating but overall okay.:   [World 1... Um, Zero]   Known as the ""Great Forest"" in game. And in my opinion, it is great... as it's the biggest highlight of the game as far as I played. As the game has no unique mechanics to really surprise the player with, this world appears to be a start towards trying to take advantage of another thing, exploration. The levels are pretty big, yet for some reason, most are still linear. However, it's still solid.   [World 2... Wait, One]   Known as the ""Volcano"" in game... but is more like ""Bright Glowing Pizza Land"". This is probably the lowest moment of the game, since most levels have the platforms (brown) blend in with the walls (almost the same shade of brown) and also at an angle where you can't exactly see the shape of the next platform! The linearity of the levels get even stronger with this one.   [World 3... Er, Two]   Known as the ""Desert"" in game... but is more like ""Slowly Shrinking Chopstick Land"". The game seems to push away from exploration and go with simple platforming which is fine, but seems misguided since it is of course, simple. There is nothing too bad about this section.   [World 4... Actually, Three]   Known as the ""Space"" in game... I've only played around 4 levels. Only problem is the fact that along with the camera jitter, there are so many models on screen it will frameskip a lot.   [Miscellaneous]   The camera has ""mouse acceleration"" and if you have a bad framerate or even just a few skips, you will find yourself making 360's for no reason on a frameskip if you're looking around. That screwed me over a couple of times. [Features] Each level has 3 main notable things about them: ""shards"" (100 points, and you can use them to buy cosmetics in the shop), goal time, and hidden trophies. The game has a lot of customization available to you, including a lot of choices for marble shape/color bought with ""shards"" found in the levels (graphically annoying when you hit them softly and it still resembles a shard that has not been taken yet). Level selection is completely linear besides the extra levels.Graphics: Best: 7, Worst: 3, Innovation: 0 [Game] It's a low-poly artstyle which has been done before, and it's done well here too... besides the ""glowing pizza"" zone that I referred to earlier. Nothing too special, though. [UI] Decent. There are some particularly annoying elements, however, like not being able to know if you passed a par time or score, as well as not showing if you got the trophy of that area. It would also benefit from customization options. + Decent otherwise - Bad second chapterStory: 5, Innovation: 0 This game has a ""story mode"", but there's not really a story. It's more of an excuse to have different backdrops/looks for each level. Not much to say here.Sound: 7.5, Innovation: 0 There are no sound clashes and the music is pretty good and it fits. I especially like the effects when you are going too slow.Replayability: 7.5, Innovation: 3 There is a lot of replayability in the game as with the other games in this genre. You do get to see world bests and their marble-ghost.Overall: 7 Positives  + Unique world exploration  + Good amount of features  + Speedrun-friendly Negatives  - Gameplay depth is shallow  - Price is high if you aren't going for replayability I recommend this game to  - Speedrunners who want more levels  - People who would like a small amount of exploration elements I don't recommend this game to  - People looking for something new and unique Misc  + Devs respond to community			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Interesting concept, though it's hardly original. The game would benifit greatly from a simple compass around the ball pointing in the direction of the goal. Looking for the goal is not fun. At all. Other than that, the game is good. Going for a faster time can get addicting, though the shards you can collect seem largly unimportant. I'd like a reason to go out of my way to get the collectables... like an increase in max speed or something.I got this game from an indiegala bundle, but I could see myself spending around $5 on the game as it is now. The stages seem kind of empty and there are some other smaller issues, but it has potential to be a great game. I haven't touched the online component, so I have no opinon on that.On max settings (1080p) I get 100+ FPS on my 4460/960 PCEDIT: Just reached some levels where the FPS dips into the low 40s on max. Seems it depends heavily on the particular level.			",236,72,6,27,6,2,28

								If you can get it at a low price, it's nice. However, one or two key issues make me not recommend this game, despite solid and fun platforming.In time trial games, I love going for fastest level times. I used to hold a few records before I quit for a while, which have been improved on since (which is fine), so I set out to beat these new times. However, I noticed that in some levels, the skips which allowed such fast times had been bandaid-fixed with invisible walls and the like, without the times abusing these skips being removed (as early as... level 4, I think). If these issues weren't there, I'd totally recommend on sale, and possibly at full price.			",248,26,5,28,7,0,31

								In its current state, I cannot recommend this game unless you are the most casual of players, and even then it's very overpriced.The gameplay its self is okay, but there's a plethora of UI issues and technical grievances:* First of all, this game has no business being 2.3 gigabytes in size. That's just disgusting.* You must access the main menu to switch to a level that is not the next one after what you're currently playing.* You press R to restart a level in the middle of it... but R to go to the next level if you're on the ""Level Finished"" screen. You must use the mouse to restart in that case. R cannot be rebound. This usually causes me to accidentally switch levels, and switching back is a 15 second process or so.* There's a large delay at the end of a level before it shows you your split. This is terrible for people grinding IL's, which the game seems to be aimed at.* Menu navigation is very slow, especially going to the main menu. This wouldn't matter much if we could change levels without going to the main menu.* The timer for the level starts without player authorization, which makes restarting a frantic rush to position the camera exactly where you want it.* Restarting a level in the middle of it results in an even faster count down to the timer starting that can often end while I'm still moving the camera. Why not just wait for movement input?Overall this game feels more like a cashgrab that was thrown together over a couple of weekends than anything else.Edit: about the game disk space thing, since a lot of people don't seem to get it. 2.3 gigs is a pretty decent space to make a pretty big game, especially for a game that may or may not have been done without the use of any real textures. 2.3, for a game like this, is absolutely massive.
