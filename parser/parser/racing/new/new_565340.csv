												funny vertical scroller game with great hand made graphics where you ride a car and shoot or squeeze zombies on your way: you have to be careful and try hard not to miss zomibies and build a perfect route to receive 3 stars for the level, to take powerups and to avoid dynamites.price is extremely cheap!
