												The game is alright, I would say better get it on a sale. Alright changed the review annd i beat the game within like 2 hours? Problem is once your get the paralysis spell on the main guy you can stun pretty much anything even bosses. The game doesnt take you 10 hours as it states, and you dont need to grind really, as long you do some fights get lvl 8 and find some gear and buy the new weps in each town you will be able to beat the game easy peasy.

Early Access Review
								A very short and sweet rpg. I finished it completely in 6 hours by getting every achievement, finished every quest and killed every monsters (monster DO NOT respawn in this game.) and collected every single treasure chest.So at the end of 6 hours, I was tired of running around with nothing to kill or do, and just went ahead and kill the big boss, Devora and finished the game.I got the game on sale for like $0.49 and is defnintely worth it. I did not find any major game breaking bugs. The quests are also very easy to follow and I have no problem getting to the end.  This game is good for taking a break, after playing a whole week of Civilization 6. Please do not have any high expectations of the game --- it's just a regular, short RPG maker game for killing time. It has a OK storyline, nothing innovative but also not buggy. Good for killing time.			",167,233,0,194,31,0,51
