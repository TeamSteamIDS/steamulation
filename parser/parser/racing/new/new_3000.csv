												A cheap and cheerful arcade racing game based on an old iteration of the chrome engine (Call of Juarez etc.) The graphics are not the best by today's standards but the game doesn't cost much these days either. The cars are all Volkswagons, from the early eighties Golf GTi to late 90's concept, old and new Beetles are included and even the VW Camper. You can customise most of the parts, by winning races and spending your prize money, but this is not a sim. Most customisations make very little difference to performance unless they boost the BHP. It takes some practice to consistently win events and opponents are challenging but a bit stupidly rough, bashing you off the track if they can. A real bonus in a game like this is the availabilty of a cockpit view, making it more realistic and challenging. It's fun, works with a Logitech wheel, and it took me 25 hours to complete so the value can't be questioned. Worth a try if you're stuck for some racing action.			",172,39,42,6,9,1,6

												GTI is a hidden gem, mostly overlooked due to is age, but don't let that age fool you, for a 10 year old game, GTI holds up extremely well. The graphics are dated but still perfectly serviceable and with some tinkering it runs flawlessly at 1080p. I was able to map all the keys to the usual racing layout on my Xbox One controller, so control wise, it felt and played great. It has a really nice array of VW cars, in  different classes, that all have a ton of upgrade options that greatly effect performance. And best of all it has awesome tracks. I really miss this era of arcade racing games when it comes to track design. Worth it at full price IMO, and during a Steam sale, this one is an absolute steal.			",861,189,88,79,73,18,74

												I recently completed all of the events in this game, and I would highly recommend it. The graphics and physics are decent for the age of the game, there are many different types of events, and lots of VW's to be had. I don't remember if I got this on sale or for full price (I had it for a while before I played it), but regardless of the price it is well worth it.  Playing this on LAN works fine, we played for about an hour the other night with no problems. When you play on LAN the downside is only the stock models are available, not what you have built in the Racing Series, and I noticed the Bus is missing. In spite of this the LAN gameplay is rather fun.			",59,16,11,1,13,1,3

												VOLKSWAG, VOLKSWAG EVERYWHERE.Okay, as you may seen on the teaser pictures or that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ headline of my review, this game is all about Volkswagen cars. You might think: ""ayy lamo B0R1NG!!!!111"", predjudgices aside (hope I spelt that right), This ain´t that boring at all.Let´s start with the pros:Yes, it´s only Volkswagens, but its quite a load of many different VWs. Standard cars (unfortunately no Diesels), Crazy cars no one really knows and quite a few interesting Concepts, including (my fav car of all time) the Volkswagen Nardo, both the roadster and coupé.Standard cars and no TDI Power? Standard VWs without TDI (except GTIs/Rs) are slow. But then there comes this function called Tuning.Yes, you can tune Volkswagens in their official game, in both visual and performance. Eat that, Ford Racing.Also there are some different Sceneries, e.g. My Motherland Germany (Bavaria), France, England, Sicily, Texas and an unnamed Racetrack in GB.The graphics for 2006... ehh let´s take a year off, cause the game bases on Xpand Rally from 2005, the graphics for 2005 aren´t bad at all. The textures are mostly sharp, the shader looks good and Antialiasing works. The Models aresomething between nice and meh. Most of them are pretty solid, but also have a few edges.K, now the part of things I´m not really sure about, how to rate them:The Handling model, It is a sim-cady like handling, tendency to either simulation or arcade, I´m not really sure.The handling itself is solid, but a few physic things ruin the fun a bit.E.G. Don´t jump or go Offroad. EVER. Offroad driving is.... playable, but could really be better. Jumps are the weirdest things since Goat Simulator. Both is kinda strange given that it´s base is a rally sim, In which you can jump and drive offroad without any problem.Alright, now the cons:Techland. Why did you use wrong specs for the cars? I mean, Volkswagen gives you the license and most likely wants you to display the cars like IRL. So Why? I mean, the Beetle has like 34 hp, ingame it has like double the amount stock.Or the Nardo, 600 hp IRL, ingame 350 hp. Why?The Tuning. The performance tuning is nice, better than in the latest Need for Greed. But the visual tuning is stupid.Bodykits do look quite nice on some cars, on others ugly af. I mean, okay thats standard for tuning in games.But you couldn´t let us decide what color we want on our cars? You only get pre-made Vinyls and paintings, you can´t change the color yourself, except you mess around with the template. Also the aftermarket rims. Ugly. Just. Ugly.The Cars in the Classes. So, the cars and races are sorted in classes, not like Forza in the complete Alphabet, but in weird titles no one really gets. No probl€em for me there, the problem for me are the cars in the later classes. In the last 3 or 4 classes some of the previous classes´ cars are in again, just a bit tuned up and with a painting already preinstalled.You can get some insane power out of these, but there are more than enough VWs in the World to fill every class with 5original cars.Long talk, short story. dis gaem ez kool and 4 only 5 bux tooooo. buy dis shet.

												This game deserves to be re-looked at for a  modern day seguel. I am freshly surprised  at how well controller support was done and my ability to map 3 seperate input devices a G27/CSP v1/CSS SQ all connected through USB and then be able to adjust max range and deadzones as well as linearity and FFB. The cars are quite drivable due to the great support for input devices and tons of options for replays. I am quite happy to have purchased this game and is a must buy at the $1.24 sale price.

												This is the first ""racking"" game I ever bought.  Despite now owning DiRT RALLY, Assetto Corsa and Project CARS, I still come back to GTI racing.  Yes... it's an emotional attachment because it's my first ""racing"" game ever, and... I used to race VW Beetles in a couple of different disciplines, but aside from that, it really is just a good, fun, casual game.  IMO:  Worth every penny of the few dollars it (now) costs.

												This is a five dollar game.I'm going to begin with that.If you expect fantastic graphics and super realistic physics, you aren't going to find them here.If you expect to be able to drift a VW Bus at 150 kph like you're in Initial D, you've come to the right place.There are tons of races that you can do in career mode. You can modify and upgrade your cars to a surprising degree. The gameplay is addicting. The cars handle more like go-karts than actual cars, so feel free to slide through a corner at nearly top speed with minimal braking. Yes, the physics do get weird at times, and the visual customization kinda sucks, and you do occasionally get stuck in the barriers at times, but remember, it's a five dollar game made to advertise Volkswagen. This wasn't meant to be a super amazing game, but that's the amazing thing. It is. I've spent more time on this game than I ever thought I would. I keep playing it even after I've beaten it.Please, give this game a chance. It's worth it. ",33,4,7,4,4,0,0

												I am very impressed with this game.  If you're looking for a low-cost, old school, arcade-type racer that has steering wheel support, look no further.  I have a generic steering wheel (an old TSW2) that hasn't been directly supported for years, now.  But it works great with this game, so I'm sure it will work with about any wheel.I'm a firm believer that racing games should be played using a steering wheel, even arcade racers.  Never understood when those in the game community say that arcade racing games should be played with a gamepad controller.  Arcade racing games started in the arcades and they all had steering wheels.  Bottom line: Great fun for minimum cost.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Need For FahrvergnügenFun, straight racing game.  All of the cars are all Volkswagons.  The drifting feels arcade-perfect.You can purchase parts to upgrade your cars.  Very Gand Turismo-esque.  Your car can get damaged and you can pay for repairs between races.  So far to me it seems that the damage only effects the look of your car.  Pity it doesn't effect performance.The music is very Euro-techno.  If you have ever used an Amiga computer and enjoyed tracker mod music, this game's music is very much like that; but 16-bit in stead of 8-bit.  Nice, but I have not heard a large number of music tracks so far.I've only played it for a few hours so far but I am really enjoying it.  When you get into the 2nd racing tier the challenge really kicks in.  For the price it was a no-regret / no-brainer.Pros:+ Decent (previous-gen) visuals.  Crank up all the graphics settings+ Great euro-techno music+ Arcade Handling+ Behind the wheel camera view option+ Challenging tracks with some sharp turns+ Upgrade your car's performance and appearance with money earned from races+ Inexpensive+ Herbie the Love Bug is an AI opponent (unofficially)+ It's fun!Cons:- Does not use XInput - use analog emulation on your Steam Controller- Only on tracks.  No street racing or cops- Upgrade options could be deeper.  No tires to buy.  Paint jobs limited set number of presets.- No rear-view mirror or look-back button- Damage model does not affect performance or handling- AI racers are kinda stupid.			",316,43,29,12,17,3,21

												GTI Racing is a game where you race variants of the VW vehicles that's GTI, from the Bettle to Golf, and more. There are variety of courses, but some are simply running the same course in reverse, or have a slightly variant route. You can also spend some of your earnings to improve your vehicle in various ways, from improved ECM to racing tires, from improved exhaust to turbocharger. This is an arcade racer, where the idea is not to make mistakes and still go fast. Graphics are decent, but that's all. It's an arcade racer, and a budget title. You can find better racing games cheaper.			",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

I mean, really fun. What's more fun than driving Beetles down a street at 175 km/h(that's about 100 mph)?			",48,4,11,3,3,0,3
