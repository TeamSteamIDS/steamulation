												Ball or marble gliding games have been popular ever since Marble Madness became a smash hit in the 1980's. Many developers have tried to emulate the high-quality gameplay and mind engaging levels that  marked the title. Almost as many have failed in their attempt to capture that classic feeling. Hence, I am always hopeful that the next one will be great but quietly pessimistic. Developer Torched Hill is the latest challenger with their Road to Ballhalla. The title is appropriate not only for the game itself but as a description of the journey brave developers have taken to contend with Marble Madness.The Question of InnovationIntellectual innovation is of undeniable importance in the video games industry. When a title has been made of such a high stature newcomers have to provide something new in order to better the title. Unfortunately, it seems like this is something that developers often do not realize or understand. Some developers have a belief that if they put a fresh coat of paint on top of the classic design that that will suffice. What ends up happening, however, is that gamers are delivered a product that disappoints. Hence why hugely popular games such as World of Warcraft have survived wave after wave of clones.Thankfully, it doesn't take long to realize the innovation in Road to Ballhalla. I've never come across a game that successfully incorporates rhythm-driven gameplay into a genre entry quite like this game does. The developers have done a marvelous job in this aspect and deserve recognition. In some ways, it reminds me of Crypt of the NecroDancer in that it combined one genre with rhythm gameplay effectively. It seems like it may have been a source of inspiration.The developers further understood that in order to have a successful title with their ideology that they had to have a great soundtrack. It is for this very reason that they hired Nicholas Singer, an Emmy-nominated composer. The soundtrack is as vibrant and alive as the futuristic styled graphics which are also of an exceptional quality. In a very nice touch, the sound effects are adjusted to the music.Consequently, I recommend that if you own a headset that you play with it on and the volume turned up. It will enable you to immerse yourself fully into the intended experience.Genuinely FunnyIf you enjoy a healthy dose of humor in your video games then you're in for a treat. The game is as full of puns and witticisms as it is balls. This is very good because it adds to the presentation value of the game dramatically. The constant flood of comedy gives the game a quirky and fun-filled personality that similar games just do not have. This, on top of the stellar gameplay, is one of the reasons why Road to Ballhalla is one of the best games in the genre that I have played.The Construction of GameplayThere are two basic modes of play within the game. First, there are the standard levels or 'trials.' When you complete a trial you are awarded tokens. The more tokens that you unlock the better you have performed. Performance is graded not only on how many lives you lost but on how many shiny orbs you managed to pick up on your journey throughout the trial. The less you die and the more you collect the better you grade. In order to progress to the next set of trials you must collect a certain number of tokens.Secondly, once you have successfully completed each of the trials a timed mode unlocks. This mode incorporates the Steam leaderboard system enabling competitive players to set the fastest times on each of the levels that you have previously completed.Is it Steamified?As well as Steam leaderboard integration the game currently has a set of 18 Steam achievements. The developers are also working on Steam workshop capabilities. As a result, the only thing lacking - and not announced - are the addition of Steam trading cards.VerdictAs a big fan of Marble Madness, a game that I still return to from time to time, Road to Ballhalla had to be of outstanding quality to win me over. It was able to do so thanks to its excellent presentation and fun gameplay. Of course, the humor played a significant part in it too. I am almost ashamed to claim that the game had me slowing down at several points because I didn't want to miss anything. Consequently, this is an easy recommendation.For similar reviews and your chance to win great giveaways (including hardware) visit http://www.steamified.com/ ",2243,882,89,270,267,28,370

			Road to ballhalla is a puzzle game with great sarcasm and challenging puzzles from Torched Hill. Review copy supplied free of charge.		

Text:The game is a nice mix of clean gameplay and cool graphics, where the simple controls are exploited to the fullest to bring complex and deep puzzles to the player with a nice variety of levels and mechanics that shake the thing up quite a bit.The PC PC controls are pretty bad, with both no mouse control in the menu's and weird audio levels in the options, and with no advanced graphics it's preset or bust. This doesnt make it an ugly game, but it does mean that unless you like what you get, you're out of luck.The game also does not shy away from being hard, so unless you enjoy the physics puzzler ganre, this might not be the game for you, but for me personally, as someone that generally does not like puzzle games, the varied mix of mechanics and puzzle elements coupled with the variety of sarcastic jokes and notes in the game, does keep it special.The game also splits Speedrunning and score attacks, which is a smart move.The game doesn't pretend to be more than it is: It's about rolling a ball to the end of a level and surviving the puzzles. And it does that with charm, control and good execution.			",129,33,2,12,20,0,24

												Road to Ballhalla is a simple top-down arcade-style game. You control a ball, and your goal is to navigate your way through 20 levels, collecting little sparks (the game’s collectable) and avoiding dying as you go.The game is very simple – there isn’t even a jump button. You can simply move in any direction, or speed up your rolling in a sort of dash move. The dash move makes it so you die instantly if you take damage, rather than simply… well, taking damage. This makes it risky to use at times, so it must be used judiciously.The levels themselves present virtually all of the game’s mechanics. Each level has its own set of unique mechanics, and only a relatively small number of them recur – and those which do generally show up no more than twice, save for the most simple of things (jump pads, laser beams, switches, bullets, damaging patches of ground, ground sections which kill you unless you have picked up blue “keys” to roll over them with, which each deactivate one such spot).However, the game still has a pretty broad variety of levels. One level sees you constantly phasing in and out of reality, allowing you to pass through/over deadly ground without being harmed. Another has the ball “hiccupping”, launching the ball in the direction of travel through the air every time, allowing you to clear gaps which you could not otherwise clear. Another level has a rhythmic bouncing which keeps sending you up in the air, a much more controllable thing than the hiccups – but you have to do much finer manipulation with it. That level also has a laser beam from the sky that damages you for 10% of your health every few seconds, limiting the time you can spend boosting as well as forcing you to get through the level within a short period of time (and avoid taking other damage). Other levels distort the view of the camera, require you to solve puzzles, require you to bounce over pits using launch pads, use a gigantic ball which keeps trying to crush you to deactivate lasers and trigger switches, and a variety of other mechanics.The game feels like it is of the right length; if it was longer, it would probably get repetitive. But at 20 (fairly difficult) levels, it feels just about right. For added challenges, you can speed run the levels, which unlocks additional skins for your balls as well as various secrets. There’s also a scavenger hunt which requires you to use clues from the scavenger hunt area and then go into the various levels and hunt down secret areas, activating purple portals which give you directions so you can solve a puzzle where you’re running your ball over invisible blocks.The game also has a narrator of sorts. The narrator doesn’t talk, but he leaves messages in the levels for you. Some of the messages change as you progress through the levels; others appear when you meet certain conditions. The narrator not only explains mechanics (often in a roundabout way), they also taunt the player, crack jokes, make endless ball puns (indeed, virtually every name in the game is based around ball puns of one kind or another), and sometimes try and get the player to kill themselves (including in one level where a new deadly mechanic is introduced and the narrator tempts the player into killing themselves repeatedly by making false claims about how it works).The game has tons of checkpoints, so getting through the levels is not an impossible task even for a fairly mediocre player. However, if you want to get all the secrets, you’re going to need to collect every collectable spark in every level, and do it without dying – as well as speed run the levels. These optional challenges are much more, well, challenging, and combined with the secret areas from the treasure hunt provide a second, higher level of challenge for the player who wants to do more than merely progress.All in all, beating the game is likely to only take a few hours, but 100%ing it is likely to take 12 hours or so.If you’re looking for a fairly simple but challenging arcade-style top-down navigation game, this is actually pretty decent. The graphics are clean, there’s a bit of humor in it, and the gameplay is challenging but generally enjoyable.Just be aware that this is a very simple game which is very mechanically oriented – there is no real story, just a series of well-designed mechanical challenges.

That's perfectly fine for some people, but not for others. I think it could have been longer, but if you're going for 100%, then it's the perfect length. There's 20 main stages in the game. You can play every stage in rush mode where you try to beat the stage as fast as possible. There's also 8 bonus levels when you beat the game that are rush mode exclusive. Every level in the game is different from the last. A lot levels add new mechanics that are used for that level only. There's a lot of rhythm based movement so if you don't like that, then this game most likely isn't for you. If everything I mentioned sounds great then buy this game!			",342,82,9,22,23,4,11

												Great game. Simple concept, varied challenges, mixed with humour. The levels may seem a bit straight forward if you're going for survival only, but different layers of complexity will become apparent as you adapt your strategies to catch all items without dying or speedrun through them. Some time challenges will require you to think outside the box in order to reach the end under the specified limit. Finally, the scavanger hunt will reveal yet another layer of puzzles, challenges and hidden stuff on top of levels you thought you knew.The music is also all kinds of awesome.

			My review of ""Road to Ballhalla"", a puzzle platformer developed by Torched Hill and published by tinyBuild. Copy supplied by publisher.		

Game: Road to BallhallaGenre: Puzzle PlatformerDeveloper: Torched Hill Publisher: tinyBuild	Copy supplied by publisherRoad to Ballhalla is a puzzle platformer developed by Torched Hill and published by tinyBuild.STORYThe game itself doesn't have a story, but throughout your experience you will find some writings that will either help you out by pointing out traps, or trick you intro trying something that will lead to your death. This way, you start not trusting them anymore, making for a very fun imaginary dialogue between player and developer.GRAPHICSThe game is very, very colorful: each level is vibrant and it feels alive. The level design is top notch, and I never had problems with the perspective.GAMEPLAYYou play as a rotating ball who can only move and speed up, and your goal is very simple: get to the end of the level and try to die as little as possible and to collect yellow dots. What makes the gameplay fun and constantly changing are the traps, switches to activate, big rolling balls to avoid, leaps of faith to surpass, hidden passages, and many more...Honestly, the game gets pretty insane later on in the game, but it always manages to be enjoyable and fresh, which is something very rare nowadays.CHALLENGEEach level is very challenging, but rarely frustrating, mainly because there are plenty of checkpoints that you can use.SOUNDThe soundtrack is hugely important here, since some traps activate and deactivate by following the rythm of the music that is playing in the background, so playing with the music on is a must if you want to avoid dying more times than you normally would.REPLAYABILITYThere are a few secrets, and once you finish an area you can play Rush mode, which is a Speedrun of the previously played levels. The achievements require you to unlock 100% in the game.Overall, this is easily the best puzzle game I have played so far this year because of its fun gameplay and smart use of the soundtrack. Highly recommended at full price.Story: n/a

												This game is a marble platformer where you try to guide a marble ehrough a series of obstacles, similar to  Marble Madness . Every level is unique and brings a new qwirk to play on, from deathballs that follow you around to cameras constantly changing direction. The game also has a great sense of humor, and the text that guides you through the levels is never not funny. The controls are tight and never feel like a burden. Overall you should at least play the game once, it is highly recommended.			",49,15,2,9,15,1,3

												Road to Ballhalla is at its core a simple roll-the-ball-into-the-hole-at-the-end-of-the-level-game.This gameplay is however embedded into a number of challenging levels with some really nice features: Rhythm based levels that make you move to the beat (loved that despite failing hard). Many levels introduce new gameplay mechanics so there is always something new. Also, a nice learning curve through the whole game. Different puzzles make intelligent use of the gameplay mechanics. Level editor for endless level building! Style your ball! It is strangely rewarding to unlock a new style.The Road to Ballhalla is not easy but no one said that it would be.I would recommend this game to any fan of the genre.Also: If you have one, play it with a controller.

												It is very fun to play in your free time, when you are bored to play games like cs:go or gta. It is a relaxing game with fun music and some jokes, but the gameplay is quite hard. If you get angry very fast, well,  you will want to smash something. Because of the big price (i got this game from some randome keys on ♥♥♥) i would not recomend this game. Maybe you have some money left and you don't know what to do with them. You should at least try it! If you won't like it at the begining, where is easy, you won't like it later.In my opinion this is a great indie game that need some skill.			",26,3,2,1,3,0,3

												Don't let this game catch you off-guard. You might look at Road to Ballhalla and think it's a shallow game with a simple mechanic - roll the ball through a series of obstacles and get to the end. You would only be partially right. This game will surprise you with its humor, its refreshing mechanics that always seem to add a fun and interesting spin on the gameplay, and its fair yet challenging difficulty.Its controls are tight and responsive so that your deaths never feel like a result of unfair physics. The soundtrack is a masterpiece of downtempo electronica that provides the basis for the gameplay. Every level shuffles its defenses right along with the tempo of the music, giving you a rhythmic foray through the stage. The levels are choreographed in such a way that a perfect playthrough often feels as though you're dancing through it.Road to Ballhalla is a game that capitalizes on everything it sets out to do. Its basic yet beautiful art style, intelligent gameplay, and groovy melodies come together to make a seriously fun game. Reccommended to anyone who enjoys a good precision-controlled puzzle platformer.			",192,46,4,9,22,1,21

This game is amazing. I tend not to write many reviews on Steam as I believe the reviews system is crap AF, but this game surely deserves a good one. ONE SINGLE DEVELOPER did this game. And the game is worth as much as any other superproduction funded with millions...Pros:- I found NO glitches at all- The movement of the ball is very very smooth, and you can use the D-PAD or the Joystick, up to you- Very easy and quick to pick up and familiarise with the game- Funniest game I played in ages!! Full of sarcasm, jokes, ""director's cut"", etc- Acceptably long (more than 14 hours game play for me to get all achievements)- Excelent music that plays a critical role in the game- Steam Workshop!!- The Scavenger huntCons:- Difficulty can get a bit hairy in the game...I am warning you.- Scavenger hunt clue 9... :ODear developer: I loved you. I hated you. Amazing game. 10/10.I am forced to say it: This game was marbleous *badum tss!*			",133,39,3,10,15,1,29

 Target Audience:    Marble Madness Fans, or those who like action puzzle mechanics. Summary:  A great example of a game that knows what it is, and complements its core design with smart design decisions along the way. Puzzle action fans will love the level design here, as it does a great job of keeping a good pace of introducing new mechanics and keep the gameplay fresh. The game is right in terms of difficulty, allowing for speed runners to really challenge themselves, while allowing “regular” players to take some time and try to work their way systematically. The controls complement the gameplay rather well, and the sound and music enhance the gameplay in the right ways. The biggest disappointment that the game has is maybe its lack of content: but that will be helped by the forthcoming steam workshop integration and capabilities. But rather then quantity, Road to Ballhalla focused on Quality, and it shows in a lot of elements here. In the end, it's not going to blow you away in any element, but it rewards you with solid gameplay. Video Review:

			Roll into the halls of Ballhallla. Oh, and a good game. This key was obtained from tinyBuild for review purposes. Mixing in action and puzzle, Road to Ballhalla takes the old style of Marble Madness...		

 Lists: Positives: Good pacing in terms of mechanics introduction. Just as you get a hang of a mechanic, another mechanic comes to help keep things fresh.  Great level design. Not repetitive at all, and uses the traps and mechanics well to keep it  Controls are good. Both Keyboard and controller work well here (I prefer a controller).  Like the division between the time attack section and the collection section of gameplay. Good sound design, with good reactionary effects. Enhances gameplay, forcing you to react to those sounds.  Like the overall feel to the game. Color schemes are good, and customization options don't detract from the gameplay with the choices available. Music is appropriate to the levels in question. It's not Emmy-level of any sort, but it's the best you can expect from a game: it enhances the gameplay. Negatives: Once in a while, a level concept doesn't work rather well. The camera adjustment level is very hit and miss, and for me, it wildly miss.  For some, content will be lacking here. 3 Hours or so into gameplay, and I was 70% of my way to Ballhalla. It feels like it needed a bit more. If you're an AVG user: you'll have to disable AVG. The game does not like anti-virus software.  Would like to see mouse driven menus.  ",529,87,7,50,31,6,50

SummaryRoad to Ballhala is a platform game with some puzzle elements. In this game you control a ball and must reach a goal while avoiding obstacles. Overall it is a good game but requires a lot of patience.+ Nice minimalistic graphics+ Pleasant non distracting music+ Very challenging+ Easy to understand and control- Snarky comments can be annoying- Restart takes too much time (completionists may be annoyed with this)- Small unnecesary annoyances can become big annoyances (e.g., restart requires pressing Enter instead of any key, menu does not loop when reaches top or bottom)ReviewYou control a ball that must be dropped into a hole. The objective is that simple. While you're at it you must avoid obstacles and you may get orbs in order to get a better score. Simple objective but hard game.Patience is absolutely required for this game. Often you have to stop or slow down in order to avoid hazards. The game is also full of helpful but also snarky comments. If you don't have patience, stay out of this game. It is possible that you may rage quit quite a lot in this game.There are some issues with this game. Restarting and respawing may be slow to some people. You cannot press any key to restart, it must be Enter. Respawning itself is fast enough but you have to remember you have to press Enter. Annoying at first but you do get used to it. The menu does not jump to bottom when there's nothing up and you press up. This is could be annoying when you want to quit the game while you're already frustrated from losing a particular level many times. Restarting ideally should be instantaneous but it takes more than I'd like, especially if you want 100% completion on every level. BTW as the developer of the game mentioned in the comment section you can press 'R' to restart. These small issues can get very annoying in a game that requires a lot of pacience.Anyway apart from small issues it is a good game. I recommended if you like challenging games like I do.EditsIn the first levels I had some issues with the overall speed of the ball and hazards but you eventually get used to it so I removed that particular issue because I don't think it's actually an issue at all when I got further in the game.Clarified that the biggest issue is that restarting takes more time than I'd like to. This could be particularly true for completionists. Unfortunally many games suffer from this issue, especially fighting games.			",103,35,1,11,9,1,17

												What a fun action/puzzle game. With a dry sarcastic text commentary to taunt you on your way this game is hard to master, but you'll have a lot of rhythm-puzzle-fun while you're trying.The “base” game isn’t long, but there are a bunch of extra bits to dig into plus you can always design your own maps to unleash your inner creative. Or to make a really easy map to console yourself with.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one game designers should notice. Why? Because it goes so very, very far with so little.-interaction of elements: take notice how the checkpoints, the blue ""keys"" and the teleporters work: all their characteristics will be used in different ways in later levels-level design: with just a handful of elements to roll through, how different can levels be? Well...very different-humour: I've just tried shiftlings, a game that attempts comedy at every corner, but that just didn't grab me. This game's designer is smart, know what the gamer is attempting to do and messes with that in just the right way. I probably never laughed as much with a game as with this, and I've played games like portal and the monkey island series. The great part is that perhaps because of the minimalistic style, the entire game becomes a part. From the ""you don't like my carefully selected default settings?"" over the many puns to even entire parts of the level (""here's what these elements will lead you to"" <you pass a HUGE-♥♥♥ HARDCORE level> ...and then that never is a level in the first place).-variety: there may not be as many levels as professional reviewers would want, but no level is alike (or easy, for that matter)I would mention the clean interface, responsive controls and the very decent music, but these are but a standard level of ""it's good"". Not to sound diminishing (ey! it has good music, clean interface and responsive controls!), but there are more games out there that feature this. The things I mention above are the thing really worth noting where this game stands out above many others.			",378,123,7,30,42,4,64

												The music is cool. That's about it.Okay okay, the game is alright, but it could be better.Some of the levels have insane challenges that require you to be nearly pixel perfect. Make one mistake, or even hesitate, and you may have to restart the entire level, especially since the only way to collect all 8 badges for a level is to get ""100% of all the dots AND do it with 2 or less deaths.""  You can't do one, and then do the other on another play-through.The game demands too much perfection for its trials.The developer needs to realize that Frustration doesn't equal Fun.Still, the game looks nice and has good sounding music.  So it has that going for it.Just can't recommend it until level difficulties get tweaked.Updated December 27th, 2016: I finally beat the game.  In its current state, it's just not worth the frustration to play rush mode (impossible times), or to 100% the levels.  (not really possible in the games current state either.)			",63,9,0,3,0,3,4

												Having been awhile since I have played a marble game, it was nice to revisit the genre with Road to Ballhalla!For sake of brevity: PROS:It has a great soundtrack, very clever and challenging levels, and great humor.CONS:Kinda spendy ($14.99 at writing, though on %10 sale until Aug 12th) for content, since it can be beat in 2-3 hours. Addition of community map suppor tin a couple of weeks will help this greatly.I had a great deal of fun playing this, and would recommend the game to potential buyers!If you want to check out a far more in-depth review of the game than what is said here, check out my review:

												When you look at Road to Ballhalla it looks like you basic marble rolling game. It should since that it was it is. Road to Ballhalla is a marble rolling game. Road to Ballhalla is one of if not the best marble rolling game I have ever played though.Road to Ballhalla is a great marble rolling game for three reasons. First the controls are simple and tight. When you die in the game it is your fault and not because of the controls. Second the game has great level design. Care and thought were put into the levels. The game does a great job coming up with unique ways to use the different mechanics and obstacles to make each level feel unique. Finally the game is surprisingly funny. Who would have thought a marble rolling game would actually be funny. Road to Ballhalla is genuinely funny as the ""narrator"" tries to trick you and taunts you when you fail.Road to Ballhalla is not a perfect game though. The biggest problem is the game is pretty short. If you aren't into time trials or 100% levels, the game will only last around three to four hours. The game is adding Steam Workshop support though so hopefully the community can add a lot of interesting levels to the game. The other slight issue I had with the game is that it is kind of on the easy side.If you don't like marble rolling games, Road to Ballhalla is not going to be for you. If you like marble rolling games though I think you will really enjoy Road to Ballhalla.For my full review check out  Geeky Hobbies [www.geekyhobbies.com].			",998,413,28,106,105,15,184

												Road to Ballhalla is a marble maze game.  The only goal in each level is to get your marble to the end of the track, while collecting as many things as possible.  Many obstacles will get in your way.  Some require pinpoint timing and twitch reflexes to overcome, and still others involve puzzle-solving or memorization.  Later on, time trials are introduced.I was disappointed with this game.I’m not really sure what the developers were thinking.  This game looks and feels very promising.  The game’s aesthetic is very appealing, with a decent soundtrack and a modern arcade feel to the art style.  Clearly a lot of effort went into perfecting the gameplay, as the controls are responsive and the ball handles well. I also really like how the music syncs with the things that kill you; lasers fire on and off to the beat; etc.Ultimately, I consider this game a real sideways-thumb.  However, in the end, this isn’t a game I’d recommend.  First, it’s too damn hard.  It is a game that is designed to kill the player constantly, and you will die a lot.  While there is a checkpoint system, levels tend to have too few checkpoints, and you will be doing some of the same sections many times.  Additionally, upon completion of the level, you will be penalized for death in the form of a reduction of the amount of your awarded badges.  The game expects (and mocks you for) failure, but demands perfection.In an attempt at humor, frequent tutorial messages appear.  Occasionally, these will lead you to your death through deliberate misinformation.  This would be fine if death were penalty-free; however, it is not.  If I want kazio deaths, I’ll go play Eryi’s Action instead.My stopping point was a level midway through the second world, in which the camera angle would frequently change; with each change of the camera angle, the player controls are inverted in a new configuration.  Inverted controls are mighty frustrating and not really very fun, but I was progressing in the level.  However, on top of this, at a scripted point, the camera pans away from your ball to show the upcoming level segment, and waits for you to complete the remainder of the previous section while blind.  At this point, I put the game down.  Who thought either of these things would be a good idea?  It’s just not that fun. ",154,112,2,28,17,3,20

												I believe that one of the most important things in the game is both difficulty and fun factor. Do you know how you make your own game a living hell? By focusing on the first but forgeting about the second one. Road to Ballhalla is a perfect example of how developers forgot to put the fun factor in their game and instead they made a game that's almost impossible to finish in 100%. Seriously. This game is all frustration and no fun. Don't buy it.Oh I forgot - this game will constantly mock and insult you. I bet developers are nice people and now they think they're really cool and stuff.

The writing is incessently smarmy - it won't shut up, it isn't funny, and it grates on what is otherwise a pleasant visual design and a reasonably catchy soundtrack.

												I was given a copy of this game to review. http://nardio.net/2016/08/08/road-ballhalla-review/This is a game that will challenge you. But it’s so fun you don’t even mind. It’s hard, but it’s also super fun. I found myself laughing more than I ever have while playing a puzzle game. Road to Ballhalla is an amazing experience I quickly found myself falling in love with. First off you need to take a second and appreciate all of the ball puns and jokes the developer Torched Hill has crammed not only into the game, but also the promotion material. It makes my inner 12 year old very happy. What is even better is the humor injected into the game. I’m going to try not to spoil much of it here for you, but the developer has a grand ol’ time screwing with the player. I found myself laughing quite a bit as I played through. It’s even fun when I go back and replay the game. It’s even more fun when you put someone you know in front of it and watch them play.Road to Ballhalla perspectiveRoad to Ballhalla is a puzzle/platform game where you must guide a ball through tons of devious stages designed not only to challenge you, but also to make you laugh. Road to Ballhalla is a wonderful experience at its best and frustratingly brilliant at its worst.Next up is the beautiful art design. I mean wow, this is a great looking game! Levels pop! I know that term gets thrown around a lot these days in reviews, but Road to Ballhalla’s levels are really nice! This game is enjoyable enough with just its masterfully crafted gameplay and level design. The fact that the developer went out of their way after nailing the game design to make the game look this beautiful is great. I’ve found myself admiring every stage. Later stages will really force you to pay attention and take it all in as you deal with ever changing visuals. Simple camera changes had me holding my breath as I tried to get through seemingly simple paths.The obvious comparison to make with Road to Ballhalla is to the classic game Marble Maddness. Well, I can say as someone who liked/loathed that game – Road to Ballhalla is the evolution fans have wanted. I feel I cannot overstate just how great this game is. It nailed every aspect of what makes a game like this great: Tight controls feel just about right for a rolling ball, wickedly smart and devious level design, mindbogglingly great music and lots of replay.Road to Ballhalla is a fun experience that is totally worth the full price of admission. I can go on and on, but really it’s nothing but love and praise for this masterpiece.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game looked very promising. I thought it would be a lot of fun, and it looked very nice, but sadly it turned out to be annoying and not very fun. The controls seem to be designed to be frustrating- movement is momentum based and becomes significantly less precise, more than would be expected from just an increased speed, when you use the (required) boost mechanic. It was fun for a little bit, but quickly got boring, and the game's mocking when I tried to exit ensured I wouldn't be back.			",60,9,0,4,7,2,7

			In this episode of PXA Peeks, I take a look at Road to Ballhalla, a game that feels like a 2D Marble Madness if you gave it a snarky attitude but also a zen presentation.		

Road to Ballhalla feels like if you took some of the concepts of the arcade classic Marble Madness, kept it largely 2D and gave is kind of a snarky attitude. It's a puzzle game that will test your reflexes and your patience but also feels oh so rewarding when you master it.You'll have to navigate a ball through increasingly complex levels with more and more mechanics introduced as you go. In every level, there are orbs to pick up that will contribute to your final score. You are also graded on how many times you die in a level. You can just brute force your way to the end if you want but getting the highest number of stars for both orb collection and lack of deaths is paramount, especially as you'll need to have earned a certain number to progress to later levels. I'm not always the biggest fan of roping off content this way but since you can just plough through a level, it makes it easy to practice. While Road to Ballhalla isn't easy, it does get easier quickly with patience.The campaign isn't super lengthy but it will certainly take a while to earn all the stars. There is also a separate mode that challenges you to beat levels as fast as possible and rewards you accordingly, unlocking more bonus content. There is also Steam Workshop support, allowing you to both create and play other levels. Some of them are positively mind bending.Visually, Road to Ballhalla is simplistic but also pretty. It also has a great, largely chill soundtrack that also syncs to elements of the levels and becomes a key mechanic. The game has a purposefully dickish attitude and will mock you as you go. Some might find this annoying but it made me chuckle sometimes too.Road to Ballhalla is a puzzle game specifically targeted as people who will like this kind of puzzle. It demands good reflexes, control and patience. If you liked Marble Madness back in the day, this is worth giving a look to.			",748,151,15,54,55,3,73

												It is a time based puzzle. A lot of challenge. At first you think hey this is easy... And then... Well. It gets crazy. I did a first look at this game, if you want to check it out and see how it starts. I really enjoy the game, and will be spending some time off cam playing it!

												Road to Ballhalla is a beautiful, and challenging game. You need to think outside the box, and use your Balls to complete the challenges placed in front of you. Highly Recommend!			",174,18,5,20,22,0,14

												good points:     art style     humor (sometimes)     ...bad points:     frustrating trial and error gameplay     unfair and too hard too early     bad level design     bad framerate     AWFUL controlsUPDATE: after talking to the developer (really nice guy, btw) and looking at other's gameplay footage, I now think the framerate problems (which led to the control problems) are just because of my laptop being unable to properly run this game and/or UE4 so maybe look at other reviews and gameplay to determine if you want this as my problems may JUST be MY problems and not other's or yours			",147,47,15,10,12,2,17

												If you ever wanted to have the fricking finger up your face, or straight forward F-U directly from the developer as a thank you for buying and playing their game, this is the perfect choice for you.The game, as well as it's messages throughout the game, are plainly punishing and insulting. Usually I don't play into the cards of dickish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s by reacting to their BS but you can't always be silent about such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t or else these mofos think they've won. The game itself is moderately challenging, up to the extent of demanding close to perfect mastering/exploiting the mechanics when it comes to getting all stars on the time attack tracks. The mechanics during regular levels range from simple over ♥♥♥♥ move to clever. It's like putting gummibears, toblerone and good old guano in a blender serving it with spoons made from razor blades while offering you some fresh squeezed lemon juice which you have to do on your own.tl;dr: steer clear of this BS and watch a playthrough instead, get the entertainment for free without being taunted for buying/playing their game. Seriously, playing with these balls yourself isn't all it's cracked up to be.			",654,157,21,100,18,3,52

												Sigh. What I meant was that this game doesn't offer anything that a free game on newgrounds can't, which is forgiveable for a first venture or a really cheap game but this is 15 effing bucks....			",264,105,2,14,22,3,18

												This game gets difficult fast, and if you lose a life during an easy part the game, the game gives you insult. Do the developper think we like being insulted while we get angry at the game ? Controls literally sucks ! This game still use the arrows by default.  Don't waste your time on this game.
