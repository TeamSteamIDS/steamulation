												I really like the concept here.  I've played other games with the two character at once concept (Brothers for example) and this game pulls it off very well.I can't recommend this game due to its overly touchy difficulty level.  I don't enjoy figuring out a puzzle within 30 seconds and then spending 20 minutes dying over and over to actually pull it off.  Lemmings suffered from thsi issue too.  After a while the difficulty is more about incredibly precise inputs instead of actually using your brain.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Squirbs is, pretty addictive and the simultaneous controls makes it a unique game. The controls and mechanics work well, allowing it to create interesting puzzles where you would have to think from both Squirbs' perpectives. The first few levels start off easy, to give the player a sense of the game. The 'deaths' remind me a little of the 'bloody trapland' game as more and more blood is splattered onto the ground.The later levels, as mentioned by other players, start to rely more on your control over the Squirbs in order to complete it. It does provide a great challenge (mentioned in the description) to the player and could be pretty frustrating.If you like difficult platformer/puzzle games (with more of an emphasis on the platformer portion), I would definitely recommend this game.

 About Squirbs	 Squirbs is a challenging puzzle-platformer in which you control two cute blue Squirbs simultaneously with one set of controls. Looking for an awesomely difficult game? That's Squirbs. Release Date: 6 Jan, 2016The StoryWhen you boot up the game for the first time, you walk over to a crystal and destroy it, and now you need to go find the parts and put it back together because you're a clumsy oaf and shouldn't be allowed around breakables. The Gameplay	the key ""selling"" point for Squirbs, or shall we say ""what it does differently"" is forces you to control two characters at the same time. So it's a multi-taskers dream or nightmare... I say nightmare because I like to feel successful when I multi-task, instead of dying and restarting like I'm playing super meat boy.All in All Squirbs[/u is a very nice 2D Game!7/10 From MeSweep ",122,14,2,7,7,0,7

												I bought this game on Itch and again on Steam simply because it's so addictive and the art is wonderful. I love the main character, it's so godamn cute and the idea of the game itself is great. And it works to perfection. The mechanics work very well and the difficulty curve of the game is executed amazingly. I found it easy to get into this game and as I progressed I found each level harder and harder as more mechanics we're introduced. This totally sold the game for me because it was very challenging but at the same time so fun to play! I'm happy to support the developers of this game and future content that they may release. Gimmie that pink Squirb aha. Great job.			",50,6,1,2,6,0,1

												What is there to say about Squirbs, it's fun, it's coop and it's deadly. The soundtrack will get you pumped for what your about to embrace. The Coop is great fun and worth a laugh, each level has been designed with precision and care to ensure the best quality gameplay you could for a game of this size.10/10 would recommend to anyone!

												Addictive two (twin) character puzzler game. Need to move both characters through traps obstacles, using the obstacles to make one character to the goal, then keeping that character from hitting traps, whilst the other character completes goal. Its a simple very simple game, but very challenging and addicting. . . with achievements to boot, you cant go wrong for a few dollars. Go get this game its a lot intelligent mindnumbing fun.

												Squirbs has been in my mind ever since its release in early 2016. It really made me believe in how much time over Christmas they must have spent on it. Furthermore the graphical fidelity was on point, all two dimentions. The Co-OP was dissapointing as it did not offer its 2 for £1 doughnuts, really a masive oversight on behalf of the developers. On the other hand playing with friends was great fun, getting to see them fail over and over made my day.In conclusion I would recomend Squirbs as it has a lot of replay value and show be one for all the family.

Disclaimer: A number of players reported a bug where they can't play the game, because they get a black screen when trying to start a new game. I didn't encounter this bug, but if you buy the game, I recommend to check if there's a problem, so you can refund the game withing 2 weeks of purchase if necessary.The developers of this small indie game seem nice and have fixed other bugs in the past without abandoning the game, so there's still hope, but there's no guarantee that they can find a fix.Squirbs is a platformer with an interesting twist:You control two characters at the same time, which will respond equally to your inputs. So if you jump, both characters jump, and if you move right, both characters move to the right. For each character, there is a crystal shard in each level, and you need to get very close to them with both characters at the same time to finish a level.The levels can feature some simple puzzle elements like crates or switches, but usually the actual puzzle involves planning a path for both characters, moving one character freely while the other one is blocked by a wall, preventing one character from jumping by pressing <jump> while that character (but not the other one) is in the air, planning when to best switch your focus between both characters, and so on.Later levels introduce teleporters, surfaces that influence your movement, and other interesting level elements.The controls are responsive, and you move / stop as soon as you press or release a button or keyboard key. Jump height can be controlled precisely by releasing the <jump> button/key sooner or later. The only thing I don't like here is that you can't jump while holding <down>, but I only remember one level where that became relevant, and I beat it after adapting my strategy.So, is this a good game?Well, I greatly enjoyed this game, and would definitely answer that with a 'yes' for me! :)However, there are two important things to consider:1) The platforming in this game becomes very technical / difficult starting after world 1 of 4, requiring you to make precise inputs in order to avoid a mistake that means instant death, so it becomes comparable to Super Robot Jump Jump, Super Meat Boy, I Wanna Be The Guy, the bonus levels in the Escape Goat games, or Kaizo Mario World. However, there are no hidden traps, and each level consists of a single screen and takes less than a minute (often only a few seconds) if you don't make any mistakes, so it's still very much doable for ambitious players.2) The game is a bit unpolished: Gamepads are supported via XInput, but you can't navigate the options menu with a gamepad, or use it to skip a story screen that you will only see once / the intro screen. Also, if you have a smaller resolution (I think the game is designed with 1080p in mind), the downscaling doesn't look as nice as it could, and button icons or numbers are sometimes hard to recognize.Another thing I noticed is that physics don't seem to be 100% deterministic on a slower PC, so it can happen that one character is a pixel further to the right than the other character after walking half a screen width, despite a symmetrical level layout. However, this was only rarely a cause for failing, so it was mostly negligible for me.I was also a bit disappointed that there was no ending, but at least there's some satisfaction thanks to the achievements for completing it.Some other reviewers claim that it becomes just mindless trial and error after some point. I can not confirm this: For example, the wall jump mechanics that can be found later are implemented in a clever way where you vertically jump if you press the jump button (no directional buttons required) while adjacent to a wall. A smart player will make use of the option to wall jump without moving the other character, while a player that relies on mindless trial and error will fail in many situations where such subtleties are relevant for success. So thinking is definitely rewarded. ;)------------------------------------------If you like frustratingly hard games and can look past those flaws, or like to try out games with an innovative concept, I think it's definitely worth it.Also, if you waver because of the high difficulty, you can still consider picking it up and just play world 1 when the game is at a discount that justifies something between 30 minutes and an hour of playtime.

-Quick Review-Squirbs is a 2d Puzzle platformer developed by Team Indev and released January 6th 2016. It's a relatively inexpensive indie developed puzzle platformer which will renew your hatred for platformers.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: When you boot up the game for the first time, you walk over to a crystal and destroy it, and now you need to go find the parts and put it back together because you're a clumsy oaf and shouldn't be allowed around breakables.(not you, reader. I'm sure you have the agility of a pikachu with perfect IV's and at level 100.)


World 1 level complete 
Community Created Artwork for Squirbs
By: Atratzu

			This was the first Frustrating level completion result I had... worse to come.		


Gameplay: the key ""selling"" point for Squirbs, or shall we say ""what it does differently"" is forces you to control two characters at the same time. So it's a multi-taskers dream or nightmare... I say nightmare because I like to feel successful when I multi-task, instead of dying and restarting like I'm playing super meat boy. (but without the Super Meat Boy Charm, and simplicity)you thankfully can skip levels, as you collect shards you unlock additional levels and additional worlds. If you're really looking for a cheap platformer this'll entertain you for a few hours.


Annnddd that's about the limit for my patience

			This screenshot is from world 2, and I'm already exhausted from platforming.		


Miscellaneous: Regarding the extra features, I didn't play co-op, but you do need to port forward to play co op (maybe that feature is really awesome sauce?), My controller worked but I felt like controller vs keyboard made little difference on this game, I got my steam card drops, and I'm not going to get the steam achievements.


Yep Nope, that's enough for me

			World 3, I've gotten the ""die a thousand times"" achievement after 3 hours of playing... yeah no, that's enough for me.		


Conclusion: As a whole, not a bad game, as a whole, not a good game. Steam is full of many developers ""first games"" and I definitely get that so I don't want to beat up on it too much. I'll let you be the judge of weather you have pocket lint and time to spend on it, or would rather save up for another game which brings more to the table.			",141,13,3,13,8,0,23

												     Although the concept, graphics, and music are all very good, the thing that breaks this game for me is that it doesn't play right.  Let me explain.  Everything in the game is functional, but it doesn't feel right.  The part that especially doesn't feel right is the edges of platforms.  Specifically jumping off them.  Sometimes you have to restart a level about 15 times for jumping at the edge of a platform to work right and when you have to make eight similar jumps in the level, it gets very repetitive and boring.  This isn't a terrible game, it just needs a little bit of fixes.			",102,27,3,6,7,2,9

												Squirbs .... What can I say about this game.....The main thing about this game is well.... complete each level by collecting the pieces of Crystal it may sound easy but its not. The Game requires you to use your brain or else you will end up DEAD like no joke DEAD because One of your little guy dies so does the other one so think of how you can get both pieces without dyingI will say this game not good in terms of graphics but who am to judge as long you have fun thats the main thing.and well the music is pretty good I will give thatOverrall I rate this game 7/10 it can be addicting so yeah :DWould say the price is a little much but if you want an addicting game and rage at times then by all means buy this game			",280,40,7,10,15,0,9

You can play this with friends and see who can complete levels in the least amount of attempts :OI completed World 1 (forest) in the first 2 hours I played, and attempted World 2.. The game gets drastically harder lol.  Good freaking luck completing it!Death explosion is awesome, has cards, fun puzzle gameplay, only 6 bucks!Get it if you enjoy a challenging puzzle-platformer.Gameplay video:

												Squirbs. A puzzle mirrior platformer game, thats very simple and very difficult. This squirb blue thing destroys a crystal making it into 2 peices. By bumping into it? Why does the Squirb have or have access to such a powerful crystal? So now you have a mirror of the squirb in 2 worlds, in witch using simple arrows key to move and space bar jump to move the squirbs through obsticles, jumps, gravity and fire traps to connect the 2 peices. The first couple levels you can get by but, it does becoming challangeing and you got to think. Dying does happen alot, good thing because its an acheivment! So looking for a brain teaser for a bit, I'd get it if I were you. Graphics are as simple as the game and the music is kinda of a mystery laid back lullaby on a loop... The squirb is interesting blue blocky guy.... Whatever works. Enjoy and die getting acheivments and get all the crystals back together.			",77,12,0,17,2,0,18

												The idea is good, and the game isn't that bad to just play around a little. But it suffers from some terrible bugs. I got a level which i just can't play, it crashes with a fatal error, and I got a level that doesn't show anything but a black screen.If these problems are fixed I would recommend it in sale.

												Squirbs is a masterful lesson in game design that with its perfect scoring system and haunting beautiful abstract world will put you in some sort of hypnotic trance. While you leave your mind behind you, tracing circles like in a Sufi whirling dance ritual. One of the most captivating game experiences since Tetsuya Mizoguchi’s Rez, that gives a true meaning to the expression videogames as an art form.JK, game sucks but music is ok.

												As puzzle-platformers go, Squirbs certainly is one of them.The concept of simultaneously controlling two characters using only one input isn't necessarily a new idea but it feels pretty well executed. That being said, the rest of the game (e.g.: soundtrack, graphics, etc) isn't as imaginative.Worth a try, I guess.(Especially if on sale)			",718,157,16,65,34,7,88

												Fun and interesting for the first hour or so.  Very cool puzzles invovled in controlling both characters at once.  Unfortunately at some point it goes from clever to repetitive and frustrating.  If you're not incredibly precise, good luck.  Would probably be easier if you have a second player.  In that case I might recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Written: 26 of January 2017   The Game opens but when I click ""Start Game"", it shows a black screen and nothing happens.. Maybe it's just my PC, but I have seen a lot of other Reviews complaining about the same Issue.   It's really sad, because this game is looking very interesting to me and I would really like to play it.. :( I recommend to not buy this game unless the Developer fully fix this Issue!  If they fix it, I will play it and then I will make another review! :\  ",73,15,0,2,4,1,3

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of those puzzle platformers where you control two Squirbs to get the crystal shards. You control them both at the same time and the levels do get progressively more intricate. I almost managed to finishthe first set of levels but I got stumped. If you are looking for another puzzle platformer think about snagging it on sale.			",613,210,9,122,44,3,55
