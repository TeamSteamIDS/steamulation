												If you EVER liked ANY ATV Offroad Fury game, MX vs ATV game, Quad power racing, or like quadrunners, or racing in general, this game's VERY under-rated, & awesome! It's cheap too, & like I said, once you get your firewall allowing it, it's GREAT online, & if nobody is playing, you get a message in single player telling you a multiplayer game just got hosted, AND gives you an option to instantly join it, how cool is that? I know people far away have issues playing with eachother on games now'a days, BUT if you live close to somebody (and perhaps the server), this game runs pretty lagfree, almost as good in every way as Pure, except the strange trick controls, but they're easy enough to master, & once you get all of the tricks unlocked by leveling up (Front flip, side-winder, scorpion-tailwhip,wheelie, stoppie, ect.) You can almost mash the same buttons as on Pure (X-360 pad default both games) on big jumps, & pull similar tricks. The FOV will make you sick to your stomach if you don't take a break every couple of hrs, but that's just cause the games so fast, & realistic (overlooking all the obnoxious boost, powerup/shortcut coins, & walls/arbitrary spinning discs with holes, that seem to be there only to make you crash, or drive around), anyways all, N all the games great, & get a few people in a game online, it has that good old Console racing feel.

												Nighthawk's Score: 7.8/10Good arcade racer. Fun to play, simple enough to play with the kidos, but has some more complex moves to master for older gamers.			",184,40,7,19,10,2,13

												Some don't like it or, claim there's better but, I had fun playng this game and I think it's worth the money. The controls are simple with M & KB or, a controller and there's lots of tricks to be done and points to be made when doing them. It's fun, interesting and fast. I've also played, Nail'd and they are not two of the same but, they're the same types of games. Both are great. Buy it full price or, when it goes on sale. To me, it was money well spent.I'd like to add that, I've never played with or, against anyone in this game, don't know how to be honest. Might be fun, Idk?It runs smooth for me on W7 and as for the graphics? Well, they aren't the greatest but, they're OK to me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Buy Nail`d. If you have already played Nail´d you will be desperately disappointed. Well it looks good and so on but it feels like nobody wants a good racing game,its as you are gliding on ice all the time. No grip, no real driving just shaking the controller stick in the right moment to not to slip into boundaries. Furthermore its one of those you have always to look at the end of the road to check what will come to avoid a crash. So its deadly in most cases to look at your Quad for even a second and i cant realy enjoy that, it kills a lot of atmosphere for me. You might to check a lets play or so because graphics arent of that Quality of that pictures on Steam shop. Here i prefer Nail`d to which Enviroment looks a bit simpler but sharper and as i said you dont always stare at the end of the road so its more present and pleasent.			",90,0,10,2,4,2,16

												w00t - fun game. I really love driving games and this one has great action, awesome track design, ok stunts and good upgrades. Well worth the money - esp on sale. It is very satisfying to win a race by a few hundredths of a second. Think MX vs ATV on steroids, but only with ATVs. If you like this type of game, you can't go wrong here. Great arcadey fun.  8)PS - if you get the new tracks DLC, you get a LOT more points to level up faster when playing those Platinum tracks.			",237,189,34,6,13,4,27

												Has that SEGA arcade feel and given that I wasn't expecting much Mad Riders is a sleeper.  Developed by Techland, I guess on the previous version of their Chrome engine (ver. 4), this racer is not the most gorgeous girl on the block but she's fast.  Unlockables include stunts, bikes, riders and events.  Tracks can take some getting used to and have multiple paths and shortcuts.  Stunts so far are nothing complicated and they earn you boost which enables you to beat the banding AI.  Different modes playable in single and multiplayer. Two words: Cheap Fun!

												Mad Riders is good for its price. You probably wont find it to be as challanging as the MX games, or Pure, but it's fun for what it is, This game downsamples pretty nicely as well, which is a nice addition as the anti aliasing settings in-game do little to nothing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lol, it's very much the same as Nail'd with everything else is almost identical, maybe the same dev who have made nail'd and if that's the reason why they had to release mad riders 'cos many customers were having a problem loading the game Nail'd It's a joy to play if you love adrenaline sort of game then you gonna love this one, yep FAST and FURIOUS.........ps some video card with SLI can cause freezes so i would switch off vsync when you finished the game and game on - enable vsync in the menu repeatedly..
