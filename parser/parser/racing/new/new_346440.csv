												Fun little game, not a bad price. If you like games with daily challenges, games that challenge you to improve upon yourself within the limits of said game, and the ability to make your own tracks. This is potentially for you. First impressions i was rather surprised, you can change from top down view to traditional follow the car view. Track builder is weak, and could use some improvement. Lots of different car choices, and a decent amount of coins to start you off. Each car has a sub-category that has different mods, and attributes. Some cars are very easy to get the hang of while others will throw you into the wall until you get the handling down just right. If your taking a break from another game, and you just want a quick arcade game to play for a few minutes, this is very good at being that. Don't expect great graphics, and the driving controls could use some work. On the plus side, i had fun with this and found it worth the price tag. If you want a budget game that has no microtransactions, and online play. This could also be for you. Basically you race ghosts of other players, you can keep challenging them over and over again while new ones appear. This is deffinitly a one more run game. Overall, it's decent. Don't go in expecting much and you will be fine.Some updates, been playing this thing a while now. Sam the admin is actively working to improve the game, and is listening to our suggestions. I am rather surprised at how hooked on this game i am, and always look forward to taking on the next track of the day. It is incredibly challenging to get a top time, and although I'm all over the leaderboards i still need some work. Advice for newbies:For new players, concentrate on one car and get the top varient you can afford. The Pike, and Turin in my opinion are the most challenging to master especially on tight tracks. Start with the Symphony or Marley if your after a top time. The daily track changes around 6:30pm EST, and most people post crazy times by about 2 hours before the track of the day changes. Don't be shocked if someone crushes your time with a better varient or a crazy driving line. It can be daunting but each track takes a lot of practice before you can find your top average times. Good luck and remember to have fun, that is what's important.			",101,87,17,28,3,0,6

												Fun keyboard racerLots of car variations and unlimited player made tracks. You start out with a bit of coin and two cars.  You can use your coins to purchase other cars and/or variations of each one.  There are also several tire choices for the variable track conditions to spend your coin on.You earn more coins buy simpy turning laps, but you earn more when setting fast laps.   So if you are within a certain percentage of the top time for the day, you are rewarded with coin.  This is all sorted and tracked via the easy to use, in-game leader board.  That said, earning coin is a bit of a grind at the beginning...not overbearing, but it pays to make smart purchases...you don't want to be short on cash when in need of some rain tires. :)Track building is simple, easy to use and very fun if designing tracks is your thing.  As far as top down (but wait there's chase view!!), keyboard racers go, I have no regrets dropping 5 bucks on it.  I'm over 5 hours in already...so money well spent. ",67,4,5,8,6,1,2

												Ok, it turns out I am a God awful driver and it took a while for me to get used to the very simple controls, but once I did I loved this game. Chasing those ghost cars of other players is incredibly addictive and in my case infuriating. Really loved the build your own track function and can see myself spending way to much time playing with this. All in all I would highly recommend this game to anyone.			",33,2,2,1,1,1,1

												Pretty bad game, there are better games produced more than 10 years ago in this genre.But but... Multiplayer! Well, that is void when the base game is poor.Definately not worth the price and I can imagine you can find flash games that do better.My advice: play something like Ivan 'Ironman' Stewart's Super Off Road instead. It's a lot more fun.			",2188,905,94,299,331,26,342

												Perfectionism. For us little people it's just a word. But for those perfectionists who go for the gold time of the day on each car class it is a word that defines everything. There is no 'if' - no 'but' in this game. No higher meaning or defining features. Just pure time trial against other people from around the world. Know what you get into.  This game doesn't care if you suck at it. It just is.  ",775,311,45,87,97,7,148

												Firstly, I am totally bad at racing games; however, that never stops me from trying 'em out! The thing I love about this one is the controls are beyond simple to both understand and use. Also, I've only tested the game on a very underpowered laptop so far and it still looks and runs perfectly. It has the ability to leave people like me addicted to trying again and again to beat those other cars in the hope of at least getting a glimpse of what it's like to win! Definitely a great game to fill an afternoon or evening with fender smashing fun.			",14,0,4,5,5,0,0

												First impression; very good game. Simple controls but that doesn't make it easy by any stretch. I feel compelled to ""try just one more time,"" always wanting to beat the other player's ghosts. Love the amount of diversity as regards to cars, really adds a lot to the gameplay. All in all it's a very fun and enjoyable game!			",8,0,2,0,2,0,1

												This game is a celebration of the competitive spirit, and nothing more.  It is not a sim by any means, and you're better off looking elsewhere if that is what you want out of Musclecar Online.My guess is that you're looking at this because it's in some bundle and you're wondering if it's worth your time, and I say that depends on your competitive spirit.  If the idea of perfecting your lines, shaving off hundredths of seconds, just to beat that one dude who seems to be topping the list every day, then this is your kind of game.  A casual player need not apply because they simply won't accomplish much.So what is Musclecar Online? It's a top-down keyboard-controlled racer (which means you need to learn how to engine brake if you're going to do any good here) that features a daily user-made track - and yes, that means they can be quite crazy - with leaderboards for 10 or so different cars, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, though some feel closer to each other than others.  The key point here is that, like Trackmania, it's all about your laptime.  Fastest laptime wins the day.At first, you will have access to maybe one or two cars and a handful of 'coins'.  This is in-game currency, so no worries about any extra charges.  These coins are used to unlock other cars, but more importantly, their variants as well as the tires they run on, and believe me, if you want to be in the top spot, you'll need to know exactly which variant and what tires you need to run.  Placing a decent time will earn you a silver medal, a great time will earn you gold, and the top spot will earn you an achievement, bragging rights, and possibly the chance to wave your virtual fiddlestick around.  Each possible position silver and above will net you more coins, which will allow you to buy even more cars, more variants, and even a fancy helmet (totally cosmetic).  For the ultimate prize in coins and prestige, win the ""daily overall"" spot by being the best in the most car classes.  I have no idea what the actual prize for that is because there are TWO SPECIFIC dudes who play this that will make life difficult for you hahaAt any rate, it's easy to sink lots of time into this game if you are chasing the top spot because you will need to set the fastest times in the most car classes possible, and that means gradually unlocking all of them and running them on the track for that day.  This can take a significant amount of time if you become obsessed with it.  You might constantly get that feeling of, ""I can shave off just a -little- more time on the next lap"" and round and round you go (protip: turn off the automatic-end-run option or you might mess up your mojo).Your opponents?  Other people from around the globe.  I constantly see players from the UK, France, Sweden, and many more.  By 'see', I mean you're not just out there on the track alone; you are racing ghosts (they can be turned off if they are too distracting) and those ghosts are constantly mocking you as you cross the plane just a hair behind them.  The game even features an in-game messaging system so you can send a note to your favorite opponent telling them how much you loathe their face and wish to see it plastered on your car's grill.... *cough*tl;dr - this is a 2D trackmania and it's incredibly competitive.  If you feel that need to run that perfect, perfect line and edge out the win against other peoples' ghosts, you will find yourself diving down the rabbit hole.  What I thought would be a filler game quickly turned out to be a small obsession and the community is great.			",1116,527,57,199,163,9,275
