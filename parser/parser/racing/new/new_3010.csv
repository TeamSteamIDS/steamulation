												I'll admit that rally games are my guilty pleasure.  Most feature mushy controls, daft physics or ridiculously undamageable cars.  this has none of those.  The controls are crisp, the physics moderately good, and cars which will fly apart satisfyingly when you ram into a building or errant rock.   The career feature is quite well done, leaving you to decide which cars to buy to win certain races.  It does have relatively few maps (4 maybe?), but  a lot of variety of tracks round them keep things moderately interesting.  Stability-wise, there were very few glitches (I can count them on one hand, after months of play). The car addons actually feel like they're making a difference, and strategic part and tyre-selection can make an impossible stage remarkably enjoyable.The games's only main downside is the repetitiveness.  Only four 'areas', means you get to race the same track over and over in different directions and different combinations of bits.  The openness of the career path does also lead to you making bad choices when purchasing cars and add-ons from time to time.   That means you must  race the same race 10x in a row to get the money to afford the thing you should have bought instead.    The only other small downside is the micro-stutter which occurs when a texture or sound is first loaded.  That can cause you to spin out, or miss a corner (e.g. when the game first loads the copilot voice for that corner).  A quick reload, and it doesn't happen there again.   Other than these small niggles, the game is notably bug and hassle-free.I recommend anyone who likes Rally games to play this.. It's got satisfaction value in spades, and while it's not as polished as Colin Macrae, I think in some areas it beats it (blasphemy!!) :-)			",210,93,7,32,33,0,53

												We can't buy Richard Burns Rally anymore, but we can buy this instead. It's not exactly a simulation (even on ""simulation"" mode), but it is a ton of fun. The physics are based in reality, and you can use all of the standard techniques to induce oversteer. It's a bit easy to go sideways, especially in a FWD car, but not glaringly unrealistic. I am not a rally driver, but I checked the FWD performance against Live For Speed (an acknowledged ""realistic"" sim) on its rallycross tracks, and I was able to get a similar FWD car (the Mini clone) to oversteer using throttle liftoff and brake, just like I was doing in Xpand. One funny thing is that you seem to be able to do powerslides in FWD cars in Xpand, which is obviously unrealistic. But that's fine, I just imagine that the FWD cars are AWD. The bottom line is that the physics are authentic enough that you can use the instincts you have developed in sims and have fun doing it.Apart from physics and realism, the game is just a lot of fun to play. I have played the first stage about a dozen times, just because it's really fun. If you do nothing but play that first race, it will be more than worth the price. The stage design is one of the best things about this game: the stages are all completely crazy, with lots of tight turns and elevation changes keeping you on your toes without being unrealistic. And unlike many newer games, you don't have to sit through cutscenes, tutorials, and boring intro missions to get to the gameplay. Thankfully, you just turn it on and go right to the good part (the sideways racing).It is an old game, so you will have to edit a configuration file if you want full 1080p resolution and 144Hz refresh rate, but it's easy. The file you're looking for is called VideoSettings.scr, and it's located in the Xpand Rally\Data folder. The settings in the file are clearly labeled and self-explanatory. Have fun!Edit: This game has a crazy difficulty curve. Don't try to drive insanely ""at the limit,"" because some very strange things can happen with the physics at the limit. Instead, upgrade your car and drive carefully according to the pacenotes. Still a fun game and worth $5.			",55,9,22,1,2,0,10

												Have not played a racing game for years. This was fun, and plays nice with keyboard, no need for a wheel or gamepad. Some of the tracks can be just a teensy bit frustrating, but race another event, get some cash, buy an upgrade and come back to it with a more powerful machine.

It is very old but its cheap and for its price, its an excellent game. Totally worth 5 bucks! Very realistic physics engines and car damage. For example. You try to turn 45Degrees on dry tarmac going 100km and it works vs trying the same thing on dust would not. Also the car damage aspect is near perfect. For example you crash into a tree and your car gets a large dent where it hit the tree.9/10 Good game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was the first racinggame using Techland's Chrome engine and just as I like that game I like this one too.For starters I still think this game has great graphics even though they've aged (see guide for setting it too your desktop resolution) and while it doesn't have an official WRC license or cars it does have an interesting carreer mode where you can buy upgrades for your cars.In simulation mode a good setup, knowing the limitations of your cars and managing your speed accordingly are key to win in this game and I found this refreshing after comparing the driving in this game with the more arcade oriented rally games of the time, only Richard Burns Rally was more realistic.My complaints are only that maybe the setupoptions are a bit sparse and that for newcomers there would be a better explaination on the setups as well as a drivingschool like in RBR, oh yes and that the cockpitsviews are unplayable.Anyway, if you want to have a fun rallygame which is also rather realistic then by all means give this one a try.

												A fantastic rally game!  It is pretty realistic I would say, although the handbrake doesn't work like I think it should and the game is lacking the function to add a clutch button for controller use but that doesnt ruin it at all. Plus I don't know the exact release date but I remember it being fairly old, so you have to take that in to consideration.The Rally Championship mode is excellent, with semi-realistic damage that may need to be replaced after every event. Individual parts can become damaged.There is are no real manufactures in here which is a let down, but the cars are all modeled after real ones and have funny knockoff names. (IE. Tiny Hooper - Mini Cooper)$5 for a realistic rally game. It was bought for me but knowing how good it is now I probably would of paid $10 for it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a pretty decent, low-cost rally game as long as you're not expecting what you'd get with a modern, $50 game.  The graphics are good enough and it has good steering wheel support.  I have an old TSW steering wheel and it supports it just fine, so it should support any wheel you happen to have.  The menus look similar to the ones used in GTi Racing.  I'm guessing these two games are by the same developer.The game has options for arcade and simulation modes, but it will still feel a little arcady on the simulation mode -- and I'm fine with that, as I have Dirt Rally for my rally simulation fix.

												    ***Please read thouroughly***   Well now, I've played many racing and rally games in my time, and this just so happens to be one. The general theme and ideas set forth by the creators of this game were actually well thought, but the full point conversion could not be made due to, what i'd beleive to be, a lack of funding or technology, or simply the want to make a fully functional game.        The first time i played this game, (enough times to make the average gamer turn in disgust) I appriciated the areas in which the game would of excelled, if not for its very bold failure, In which I mean the physics. Most racing fans love realism or simulation, in fact alot even prefer arcade style driving... but this game is far from either, with the realism of a 1982 version of a grand prix game. I can say in nay of everything wrong, once you get used to it, it becomes quite enjoyable and the stages themselves are quite challenging, eliminating the boring far off expectation from a ""3rd party"" game title. So all in all, I like this game, and i beleive most will, after the hour (or 5) of trying to comprehend how u controll you AWD beast.... And lastly, the game is very cheap, for that price, the game is a 10/10   ",1,0,4,0,0,0,0

												I am very impressed with this title. In rainy conditions, the windshield wipers are not only effective, but very realistic. But they only have one speed.Rain pellets and snow flakes(semi-melted), are rendered to great effects on the windscreen. When you get stuck in the snow, wheel spin is not effective. Just like in real life. Slowly modulate your throttle, and you will notice your tire tracks on your way out(hopefully). The headlights beams or light patterns, are crisp and powerful. Sadly, there is no high beams. Weather, clouds, scenery, farm animals, and humans are a ""tour de force"" towards attention to details. Damage is taken to account and well made. Frame per second rate was never an issue, smooth as glass. User friendly menus.My Logitech gamepad F310 is perfectly compatible, real easy to program, and a pretty good compromise to an expensive wheel and pedals set up. Cheats are available, but haven't been able to make them work for now. Will report on that topic later. By now I think that you know that I like this game(Rally sim).I also have in my library, Xpand Rally Xtreme. You might of seen that one coming...			",10,4,2,0,14,0,0

												I have all the driving games and I REALLY LIKE THIS ONE. I like the cameras and the cars. The setups work and you can make your car faster and hook up better. Its not the best looking, actually its pretty dull, other than the odd Gazel running across the track WHICH you cant hit anyway so not really sure why they are there other than to take away from the dull track HOWEVER, the surfaces react normal and you can adjust the car or buy parts to match. I would say this aint a $19 dollar game but it is DEFINITLY a $9 game all day long ENJOY !			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was surprisingly good! It's not at the same level than Dirt Rally, but if this game is on sale, you should give this game a shot.			",35,0,24,0,9,0,0

												Heyyo,A decent enough rally game from Techland on their Chrome engine that powers all their games to date. Graphics are nice, gameplay is alright and it's a decently priced game. There's better rally games of course, but if you're looking for a cheap on the wallet game? This one's the way to go... not that mobile-port BS Collin Macrae Rally from Codemasters.

												Poor quality for its period. Also, you cannot drive with the mouse, so unless you have a steering wheel, it will be crappy playcontrol at best.It is quite ordinary compared to other rally and race game of the same time period.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
