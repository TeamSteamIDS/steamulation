												Biggest reason not to buy: http://www.ultraimg.com/image/xtU3The dev (shortly pre-release) deleted all negative posts and (perma-)banned EVERYONE outing negative critism. Even when they did adhere to the Steam guidelines.The developer also attempts to hide it and lies about it, saying that he welcomes criticicsm: http://www.ultraimg.com/image/xtU5Pros- It has Steam achievements.- It has trading cards.- Erm... It has half naked girls?Cons (first version of game)- Maps are extremely poorly made. The developer is certainly not anywhere near an experienced RPG Maker user. See also this example to illustrate that the developer did not even spend 10 minutes on his maps: http://www.ultraimg.com/image/xtU6- Around 98% default graphics where used. If you include the unused files that were shipped with this game, over 99%. No(t much) money was spend on this game aside from some character busts and 1 single custom battle background and maybe some free music.- I explored the game-folder because I was kind of surprised why this is over 300MB. Seems the dev did not even bother to clean up the project. It has LOTS AND LOTS of unused files... Also no proper compression and no proper file-formats used. All just default.- Combat is basic. Just some plugins from other people thrown together. Looks half finished, unbalanced and feels static. Also the enemies you encounter all came default with RPG Maker. The dev did not even bother to create or adjust the enemies himself. Because that would actually take a few hours of time...- Most of the music is also default. I have heard it a 100x before in other games. But not all.- The prologue does not have a background it's just a black screen. This could be okay in some cases but not here. Also it's unskippable, It can be speed up a tiny bit though. It also has spelling mistakes. And the rest of the game also has plenty of spelling mistakes.- Using names like Kami (Japanese for god)... Well, it beats Kitsune I guess.- Lots of events where SFX seem absent or may have been forgotten.- Didn't use any different dialog-backgrounds to indicate that people are thinking instead of speaking.- Half the positive reviews here of questionable nature. The only review that has a lot of (up)votes is a negative one. Some of those people that claim this game is awesome have logged 0.5 hours. Then thereafter they played many other games instead.Also people who can't find a single positive point aside from ""I really dig the music"" and still upvote the game. Not to mention their indirect ties sometimes to the developer. It all looks of very 'questionable' nature.- Menu is 100% default. Just like the rest of the game it's very minimalistic and it feels as if it was made in just 7 days time.- Some maps allow you to exit by touching the edge of the map while other maps require you to use the markers.  Sometimes the same area has sections where you can do this and sections where you can't do this. This inconsistency is insanely annoying and extremely bad game design. You can clearly see this in the 2nd area (forest south west of the starting town) where this happens randomly everywhere.- Random texts appear telling you where to go so now and then. There is often no story behind it at all. And you better not forget it because the game won't tell you twice.- It goes on sale for 40% off right upon release.- The story is AWFUL. You visit your mom's grave ""Hey mom"". Then shortly after ""I better get back to the village"". Why? Because the dev did not include a reason for you to go to places where he wants you to go. This goes on and on.- I can't name my characters. I can't even name my characters in a RPG Maker game?- Etc. etc. etc. You get the idea.And this is where I stopped playing.A shameful game, with an even more shameful dev. Shame on both for releasing such a poorly made game. And shame on Steam for allowing this. Maybe I should also release games like these. Maybe like 2/week or so and ask 2 bucks for them with a perma 50% discount and some half naked content to attract some attention.And those reviewers claiming that it is only a few bucks, it's a few bucks totally wasted and spend on a developer that does not deserve it.The dev told me that the reason the game is still good despite all the 'lies' I wrote in my review: ""But it's only like 1$""...UPDATE: My response to the developers response to this review:Every perspective is biased, lets not pretend there is some magical thing called a 100% objective review.As a developer of the game you're also heavily biased, to all the faults and you ignore the truths (which I can proof and some I even did proof) of my review. But you keep denying them and keep calling us liars.If you really want to convince the critics, just address the arguments on its face. Attacking me instead of the review/criticism all the time. Except the majority seem to agree with me not you.Maybe come back with actual substance... Addressing the issues instead of attacking your (potential) players it's simply not cool. Perhaps you could fix the mistakes in your maps, improve the things we pointed out, reverse the bans and apologize and I will be so honest to rewrite my review then. Which, you can not delete&ban, only Steam can and Steam does not believe I violate any rules/guidelines.I mean Silver only ever played Chosen for 20 minutes, after already telling us how terrible it was.While my review has extremely low game hours, so did a lot of positive reviews, so why not criticize and possibly ban them just as much as me? Or is it because they agree with you?Graphics&maps are a ""visual"" experience, it requires no gametime to make a judgement based on it, I can watch a gameplay walkthrough and still have an opinon of the developers mapping skills and level of polish.Clearly though Silver knew exactly how long it took to make the maps that he/she had not even seen yet.And like I said many times before: I did see it before I criticized it in the screenshots/video YOU SUPPLIED pre-release and I showed you proof in the other review already. But keep saying it often enough maybe someone will believe you...Regarding the ban reasons:First reason: ""crazy criticism & violating Steams guidelines"". Note that I did NOT violate Steam's Guidelines (yes I wrote Steam support about it). Later he changed it to ""You have been banned because you criticized my game without even seeing it"". But again, I did see it on the screenshots and on the demo video the devs SUPPLIED pre-release and ended up (unaltered&unpolished) into the final version.Also other people got banned for the same criticism. Later he changed the real ban reason to along the lines of: ""I thought that you're another developer who is jealous of my work trying to make me look bad""... If anyone is jealous of this work... Then that person must have a hard time finding a job in the game industry for sure.Then he proves even more of what an amateur he is by publicly arguing with banned users in a review (another review, not this one). And when I complained about spelling mistakes he said something along the lines of ""but your review does too""... I never in my life saw a developer respond like that.A prologue should NEVER have spelling mistakes, since that is the first impression of your writing they get, and will demonstrate the judgement they will be biased in. But to shift blame like that is a new low that I have never seen before.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

My Impression:I usually steer clear of RPG maker games, but I was interested in the fact the description compared it to Chrono Trigger. It is nothing like Chrono Trigger. It's a very generic JRPG with a generic storyline. I beat the game with all the achievements in 4 hours, including the hidden items.Positive:+ Character art is pretty nice, not sure it's original (also, there's no nudity like the tags suggest)+ RPG maker combat is always nice, its a throwback to the past+ It was just long enough that I finished it without saying this game is just too bad+ Music was pretty decent+ Hidden ""quests"" if you want to call them that add something nice+ Trading cards with nice backgroundsCons:- A lot of bugs, maps you go up into will start you at the top for instance. Ultimate weapons are not named correctly. Balancing issues caused by not testing enough. Another bug is that some of the bosses don't disappear and you can re-fight them over and over again, and one of them you can accidently refight just based on the positioning of the objects.- Very linear- Pay attention to where you are supposed to go, they mention it once after each major event, easy to get lost- Story is pretty genericBelow Average Game: 4/10I got the game for 40% off, and I probably would recommend it at <$1.00 to anyone that wants to beat a 4-5 hour generic JRPG.

												Imagine the most generic RPG Maker game. Now imagine it with anime chicks with boobs. That is this game. I recommend this game if you are under the age of twelve and have never seen boobs before.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game for half an hour, and I actually may return to it to be honest. However, to be clear, the only reason I would go back to it because it is hilarious. That is, hilariously bad. It'd almost be a parody of stereotypical JRPGs if it didn't take itself so seriously. And the bugs. Just in the first half hour, without trying to find them, I saw at least three graphical errors and an NPC that gave me speech based on events that had not happened yet. I paid less than a dollar for this game, and that's all it's worth. I've used RPG maker, even with just the base program you can do much better than this. Buy it on sale if you want to laugh at the cliches, but otherwise steer clear.			",66,18,0,21,3,1,7

												Even if you ignore the accusations of censorship being thrown at this game's developer, it's really not worth playing. The plot is cliched as hell and ends on a cliffhanger in a blatant attempt to hook the player in for a sequel, the writing is full of mistakes and feels extremely unnatural, the game itself is very short and very easy (I beat it in less than 3 hours even after doing every single side quest), and all of the art and sound for the game aside from the character busts comes straight out of the default set of assets that comes with RPG Maker VX Ace.Oh, and there's also a bug that makes you fight a boss all over again if you trigger it.

												Oh dear. I knew it was a risk buying a game with mixed reviews, however cheap- but this RPG takes the biscuit.Where do I begin? I have only played this poor excuse for a game for half an hour and have already been thrown from my gameplay back to the main menu twice, with no way of continuing.The artwork is pretty shoddy- I think the purpose of this game was to get as much cold-nipple look in as possible? The artwork for enemies during battle is laughable- it looks as if they've been torn from a clipart database, any form of animation for these things is also out of the question.Battle UI is clunky- I couldn't see if there was a way to even see enemy health, but perhaps I was missing that somewhere? The size of the sprites is puny compared to the enemy images also- the soldiers are suddenly 10x taller than you when you are battling them. Even the achievement art is indistinguishable from one to another.More complaints- spelling mistakes here there and everywhere, dialogue is stiff and unnatural.... everything seems forced and half arsed. To put it bluntly in the time I was playing this, it showed itself to be one of the most bland, copy-paste games I can even imagine. A clever marketing plan- spend so little time on an empty unpolished game, then charge pennies for it in the sales.... people will buy in the sale frenzy without even thinking about it- and all those pennies add up eventually. How did this unplayable mess make it on to Steam, I don't even know. Smh.Do not buy unless you want cheap achievements. I feel this is the only redeeming quality of this game. I will probably play again to 100% it myself, but I really wish I'd spent the money on a Freddo bar instead.			",34,40,0,3,14,0,6
