												Okay, first of all, this game came out in (I believe) 2007, so no... If you are looking for top of the line graphics you are not going to find it here.  Also, this game is not simple.  If you want simple there are tons of Flappy Bird clones out there... But Darkwind is definetly not going to be for you.  Quite simply, Darkwind is not a game for everyone.  But... The people that it is for will be blown away and will wonder ""WHY DID I NEVER HEAR OF THIS GAME BEFORE NOW""Darkwind is a bit hard to describe, but if I would have to put it in one phrase it would be this:  Darkwind is a Turn Based MMO Mad Max Gang simulator on permenant ""Iron Man"" mode with a nice physics engine and a whole slew of vetrarn players who would much, much, rather spend time helping you than PVPing you into the ground. Pretty much if you would rather play X-COM than COD, or Civ over Halo, or Jagged Alliance over Starcraft 2, you really should check this game out.			",248,81,9,78,44,4,108

												First thing to notice about this game I guess, is it's not pretty to look at, irregardless of how old it is. The landscapes are terrible, even for post apocalyptica, the cars are really simple, and the UI is downright terrible. Visually it really has nothing going for it. Even the sound is somewhat irritating.BUT, you don't play this for aesthetics... You play it because of the amazing physics rich turned based combat/racing. Once you get used to the UI, this game really starts to shine. At the start of each turn you change steering, gears, weapon targetting, etc. and once it's all set watch the next 3-4 seconds play out. This gets hectic when you're racing against a large group of players.The real beauty lies in how each action follows through subsequent turns. Made that hard right a little too hard? the next 3-4 turns will be spent countersteering, and when it works... oh boy does it work. Pulling off successful drifts, jumps, etc gives you a real sense of accomplishment. Combined with terrain realistically affecting your cars handling and you have racing that equals any AAA racing simulators.I've been playing this on and off for the past 4 years, so don't let the steam counter fool you. I highly recommend at least trying this out. Once you get past the unfriendly UI and get to the actual racing, you'll have a hell of a time.			",245,16,5,31,14,1,7

												What a brilliant game. Im a bit biased I guess as I come from a place where I used to play something similar on paper. Some say it requires crazy amounts of patience and dedication, Masochistic tenancies, OCD, a lack of any form of life, but really its just that we love playing DW so much because its different.It doesn't have fancy graphics and super sounds of zoz but it does have a more than usable interface and the ability to do a lot of different things.From the time you scrape together your first little car and stick guns on it, plonk in your best character, you find out how cruel and twisted this world can be... when his head gets blown off and you lose everything. You soon find stuff is easy to come by and theres always another lost soul in the tavern to juice up and stick into a hotted up piece of heavy metal and blast stuff with rocket launchers.There is no pre designed path or RP dialogue but there is the tools to have the most engrossing and everlasting RP experience.Its dangerous out there, you could die.. Rub up the wrong player, and you could die a lot. Or you could just go your own way.Graphics        2Sound            1Functionality 6Bugs              7Idea               10Community   10Fun                10 ",18,7,6,10,3,0,16

												Surprisingly fun, the driving mechanics are simple, yet very well done. If you take a sharp turn at speed the car won't magically straighten out, you've gotta counter-steer, and the community behind this game is great, they actually help new, idiotic players rather then telling them about intimate relations with thier mother. I'll admit, a turn-based car-combat game sounded, well, really dumb at first, but it WORKS!			",154,33,6,37,34,1,18

												The game is a set in mad-max like setting, gazzeline is expensive, cars have guns and armor and all that, you shoot others to loot their cars. The game is also turn based, so it's expected to be slow - idiots that have a problem with it shouldn't really review a game that they don't like just because it's turn based. The game is rather simple to get in, you get a vehicle, you mount guns on it, you assign crew to it. One drives, other shoots. Or even the driver can shoot if you like. Unfortunately a few mechanics of the game aren't explained, the only way to get to know the unexplained mechanics are through community interaction, like demoralising - how does it work, you just have to ask. But the basics aka the driving/shooting is explained in a short tutorial. The game doesn't have any bugs as far as I seen, you shoot at others - they recieve damage depending on from which side you shot. You take damage if you get shot at, you damage tyres if you do too sharp turns, you damage your armor if you ram into a wall.Another thing is permakill feature in this game, which isn't that much of a feature used in newer games. If your crew dies - you have to hire a new one. If your car is destroyed, it's destroyed. No fixing it. I myself like permakill feature in games, makes it more tedious when you're playing against a player (You mostly play against bots in this game however.) and you have to be more careful with your turns.So yes, the game works, it's good, but it doesn't look good because it's a game from year 2007. Other than that, you can get rich and good without investing a buck into it - just ""roll"" a scout with other players, get new cars. Sell them or keep them. Your crew gets experience and get better the more encounters they survive.However, once you get rich and can take on any encounter, the game begins to be rather boring - there isn't anymore to do other than maybe fight other rich players for their cars. But it is fun till then, and that can be more than 100 hours.Most that review this game negatively are just casuals who can't handle losing their first car, really. The community is friendly as hell, and they will even give you a car if you ask nicely enough.			",174,8,2,11,5,1,16

												First of all this is a 2007 title and it look’s like it, not that that necessarily means that it’s completely bad. I’ve ‘played’ it for around an hour and 45 minutes. I say ‘played’ because I spent I most of my time in the menu trying to figure out how to start playing the game, the game decides not to work half the time. I was eventually able to complete a whole match which I enjoyed.- If you aren’t a really patient person, don’t a lot of time on your hands and don’t like turn based games you should probably skip this- You actually control your vehicles movement by using manipulating the steering wheel and with the physics your car can spin out of control, I thought that was really cool

So at first I had no problem getting into the a couple of tutorial matches, You just need to click on the big tutorial button in the middle of the menu. The tutorial tips missed certain points like the fact that you need to destroy the car on the other side of the map to end the first tutorial. Also after my three attempts at completing the tutorials I initially couldn’t get into them again even though in the menu I was told that the tutorial would be starting.-----I thought the way you control your car is cool. It took me a while to work it out. You don’t actually just click where you want your vehicle to go. You actually need to change the position of a steering wheel and throttle by dragging them with the mouse or using the arrows keys. So it’s sort of like a simulation of real controls. The game indicates where your car will move to after you end your turn. When you end your turn a few seconds will pass and the vehicles move, a little bit… lol. You have to complete a lot of turns in order to cover substantial distances, because vehicles will only progress bit by bit. You will need to adjust your throttle and steering most turns in order to avoid hazards or losing control and to navigate the environment.-----I thought this was really cool. Your car will spin out of control if you just lock the steering wheel and max out the throttle, and stuff like that. I think going inclines can cause your car to flip too, I didn’t put that to the test yet. You can also drift and go over jumps.-----Vehicles will have different guns equipped depending on their model, I think you can also customize the loadout. Guns can be on the front, back or sides of vehicles. Drivers only appear to be able to fire front guns. But you are able to have passengers gunning weapons in the other locations.-----I had to figure out how to use weapons, I didn’t see any instructions. You have to fiddle around a fair bit. You need to open the management tab found to above of the throttle and steering wheel controls. Click on the weapon then the occupant you wish to assign as the gunner. If you can’t assign a gunner to a weapon it may be because it’s a melee weapon used for ramming. If it is a projectile weapon click on the weapon in the management tab again to see the firing arc and select a target by left clicking it. Then after one turn you will have the option to set the weapon to fire one time only or every turn until you say so. The weapon will fire when it’s target is in it’s firing arc, which may require many turns of repositioning to achieve.-----So that’s what I did for the first 20-30 minutes, the tutorials. So then I wanted to get stuck into the game, I wasn’t sure how it worked. I thought it would be like an open world but you actually just appear to join events such as death-races or arena combat. I think there is actually on foot combat events for you gang members as well as vehicular combat. The game makes reference to a number of towns but I have no idea how this all works i.e. how you go to them.-----I was initially very confused about how to actually join one of these matches, it probably didn’t help that I was tired. Anyway what you are supposed to do is click on an upcoming event, the list is pretty much in the middle of the main menu. Sometimes nothing happened when I did this, which is one of the reasons I had so much trouble getting into a match. I think this might have been because of connection or server, sometimes I was disconnected without realizing it. There is no connection status indicator or sound played on disconnect and and it’s easy to miss server messages with all the chat going on. Clicking login seemed to fix this problem sometimes. Unfortunately doing so while you actually already have a connection will kick you and make you wait 30 seconds until you can reconnect.-----Anyway if things are working properly, clicking on an event in the list should bring up a menu. Click register and then then scroll down and click register again. This should add you to the list of competitors. In each match that I joined everyone seemed to be given a stock car. Once the countdown timer has reached about 3 minutes you will be able to enter the event by clicking play game in the same window. You can leave this window before this but you may have trouble finding it again if there are different events with similar names. For some reason a lot of events have very long countdown timers, sometimes over an hour. You will probably want to choose one that has only a few minutes to wait.-----I have successfully joined and completed one ‘race’. There were initially two other player controlled vehicles. The other ten vehicles or so were AI controlled. Every human player needs to repeatedly end their turn in order for the game to progress, otherwise you can be sitting there waiting forever. I think all players were first timers like me. All the vehicles literally gradually inched along as the players locked in their turns. Although it was a race surprising at like turn 28 half way through the first lap, weapons went hot. So missiles began flying everywhere, but everyone quickly ran out of ammo. After around half an hour and I think about 150 turns, I think I came 5th which should have earned me a reward. But my car just disappeared and I returned to menu before the last cars finished. I didn’t see a results screen. I later joined a combat arena match but for some reason I was disconnected.-----You can buy and sell vehicles and items from NPCs and other players. I didn’t do anything with that, it doesn’t seem to be necessary for a new player.-----I started with five gang members. They crew you vehicles and have different stats making each of them suited to specific roles including driving and gunning. Again I haven’t played for long enough to see how this affects the game. I just allowed gang members to automatically be assigned to positions in my vehicles.-----There is also what look's like some form of scenario editor which I didn't really get a chance to look at properly.So yes the game has 2007 graphics. But honestly they do the job. The textures are pretty basic, but the physics are cool. The cars bounce around on their suspension when they go over uneven terrain etc.-----The main problem is really with the interface in the menu. There is no indication when you are disconnected from the server. There is no status indicator for events that you have requested or registered for once you have left the event registration window.So yeah they game is old but I don’t really care about the graphics. I actually really wanted to get stuck into the gameplay because I liked it. But with server issues and stuff the game just made it hard for me to actually play it. If you can join events with friends, I would like to do that. But I’m not even sure that you can at this stage. If I can get the game to work reliably I think I would like to spend more time playing it.Click here for my YouTube gaming channel			",184,27,1,19,6,3,21

												Darkwind: War on Wheels is a very indepth game for anyone who enjoys engulfing themselves into a vehicular apocalyptic chaos. The game is very detailed and well balanced with unmatchable gameplay but some may find the graphical aspect a bit outdated. I feel it serves the game very well, giving it an old school PC game atmosphere, which I enjoy.It is the type of game that would require patience and time for optimal enjoyment, which in turn would make you hate it right off the bat or you will begin to love it more and more like a long term relationship.The gore and graphical detail during the events is very entertaining and gives the game a grim and humorous feel.

												Considering this game is about 8 years old, don't expect much out of it in the graphics department. The concept is great. I've spent a good time playing this game, and I love it. Many of the players are veterans, and are super friendly. They can help out with any sort of problems. There are many words in the Lobby that are going to confuse the noobs, though, which is a problem. The game takes a while to get used to, so give it some time before you figure out what you're doing. For the noobs out there, I have made a guide on this game to help out.			",74,11,2,10,27,1,20

												Here is some Pros and Cons of the game. I have to say only certain people will like it.Pros: The Physics are excellent.         The community is very friendly         The game is fairly fun overall.         Also, the game is very detailed from damage logs, to drivers and ammuntion.Cons: The UI is bit clunky.          The graphics are not the best.          The waiting times vary, from a couple minutes, to a couple hours.          It has a bad learning curve.Overall I would say 7/10. I personally enjoy the game. I am new to Turn Based Games, but I like this one. I have only hit the tip of iceberg, and still would recommend this to you. I think this is much better than most of the stuff out right now, and would consider playing. I say, play Darkwind: WoW. P.S. Ask someone in chat to scout.			",85,7,3,3,13,0,5

												Hey you like Autoduel, Car Wars and all those other 80s games about cars blowing each other up in the post-apocalypse? Great, then you'll love the fun combat in this! In-combat controls are quick and fun and you'll be watching your car catch fire and kill your drivers in no time.Unfortunately it's seriously, SERIOUSLY let down by the horrific matchmaking interface, which is handled via website for some godforsaken reason. Half the time the scripts dont even work in the Steam browser, so you've to keep switching between the game and the website to manage stuff, it's that ludicrous! I cant really recommend it, even if I want to because of how awful it makes just getting pick up and play games going.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 The game does have a fairly steep learning curve which probably scares off most casual players that aren't willing to invest a few weeks learning. The game presents a very unique mix of car battles and racing, turn based tactics(even races are turn based) dozens of cars, scores of weapons and a helpful community. If you ever wanted turn based vehicular combat with some rogue like traits or if you ever loved the original Fallout series or Eve Online then this game definitely warrants your attention and time.The graphics are dated, yes,  though the game has been out for more than 7 years. Don't let that stop you from what turns out to be, given some patience and persistance, a very intense car combat game where you become attached to cars and your gang members only to have your car catch fire and blow up and your gang leader takes a bullet to the heart or skull killing him instantly.

												My review? 10/10TL;DR version of review?:Read the introductions, Wiki and watch some videos. Then give the game a shot. ASK QUESTIONS IN CHAT! Plenty of vets that will gladly teach you the fun of this game.Long version:Now, I've been playing this game for a few days before the Steam release. So ignore my current played time listed.Before giving this game a shot, you need to take note that this is no fast paced twitch based shooter like you'll usually see on Steam. Give the wiki a read and take a look at some of the introduction guides and videos.KEEP IN MIND! There are ALOT of issues popping up with the Steam release that should be fixed in the next few days. Give it some time aswell.Dont jump on the hate bandwagon because of the graphics. Look past that and at the gameplay, physics and fun you can have. This game is something you'll love if you enjoy turn based combat with wonderful physics. Tabletop games and pen and paper RPG's. Half of the negative reviews shown so far are from people who didnt bother checking the guide or asking questions in chat.People load in, dink around in options and think ""Oh, this isnt fun. I dont have anything to do."" They dont bother asking questions, reading up on the game and just scoff ""This game is awful"" before leaving.Is the learning curve steep? Yes.But, there is hope. I joined up just as confused as most of you. I took a wee bit of time to read up on things and gave a race a try. I then asked a few questions and quickly got assisted by some of the vets. If half of you would take the time to ask some questions, play a few scouts with some good people and actually get a taste of the game I'm sure you'd either enjoy it or hate it. But thats exactly the problem. Most people will join this game and assume you can get right into the action. Get mad because they cant figure out what to do, troll around in the chat for a few then run back to TF2. Again... Give the guides a read and dont be afraid to talk in chat and ask us questions. We can gladly help you.All I ask is before you post a review is do more than just dink around in the client for 6 minutes silently before logging off. Speak up and let someone ingame show you how this is meant to be played. Then base your review off this. Keep in mind aswell that Sam and the crew are busy making the transition to Steam aswell during all this and doing his best to fix all the problems popping up and give you anenjoyable experience.Hugs and Kisses xoxo-Herzen			",37,0,2,2,1,1,3

												If you want to be taken by the hand while learning the ins and outs of a game, this is not for you.If you need great high-def graphics to enjoy a game, this is not for you.If you want a forgiving game, this is most definitely not for you.However:If you like unique games, don't mind scanning through the forums and wiki  for answers, enjoy games set in a wasteland like Fallout or Mad Max, and want a challenging, unforgiving game in a persistent world where most learning will be done by comitting fatal errors, look no further! Once you experienced nearly your entire crew getting killed and lost all your vehicles on what you thought would be a routine run, you will show your true face. Can you fight your way back (through many setbacks along the way) or will you tuck your tail between your legs and run?I haven't regretted a single minute in this game, including - or maybe especially - these setbacks. Your special prodigee, who you spent so much time on in order to make him a worthwhile gang leader, may be (and most likely WILL be) dead in the blink of an eye if you slightly misjudge a situation. You will find yourself getting very attached to your gang members, but also to some of your vehicles. In fact, some cars will be more important to you than some gangers, and you'd rather risk someone losing a limb (yes, it happens) or his life than having your car captured.That's Dark Wind for you.

Yes, the game is fun, once you get into it and figure it out, but in the end it's 15 years too late and not enough effort by the developers in any direction at all.Make no delusions, this is a quick reboot by a dying game in a last ditch effort to make a few more bucks.

												This is the single greatest car combat game ever made!  For true strategy/resource players only.  Do not even bother playing this if you need hand-holding and instant gratification.  If you need that, buy Mad Max. This game is for lovers of the paper Car Wars game...  You start out with very little, the strategy is real, character death is permanent (but you control a whole gang and can recruit), and building up a road warrior gang takes time.The physics are what make this game great. The interface is not!  This is an old game that has a web-based client and a companion website that work together.  It is ugly and dated...  and is truly amazing.Veteran players are more than happy to help out new players who are willing to stick around.  Install this, play the tutorial, and ask questions in the chat.  I am always willing to provide guidance, cash and cars to new players.			",9,1,2,6,2,0,8

												This game has quickly become one of my all-time favorites. It is a turn-based game reminiscent of the old table-top miniature games set in an apocalyptic, harsh, and un-forgiving future. The future that could be… You start off with a handful of gangers and go about trying to make a name for yourself on the racing tracks or combat arenas. The best way to describe this experience would be if Games Workshop's Dawn of War and Mad Max had a love child, this game would be that child. Be prepared for hurt... be prepared for agony... be prepared for blood, guts, shrapnel, and petrol spew. The highs are high… and the lows... well the lows are downright nasty!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												  Ive been playin Darkwind for almost a decade, maybe longer. I keep coming back to it off and on and everytime I do I get hooked for awhile again! This game has alot to offer. Many different ways to play it.  I can understand why some people are turned off by it. I remember when I very first tried it I thought how the hell could turn based car racing be fun. I thought of racing as flying around at breakneck speed dipping and dodging around an intricate racetrack. Let me tell you though... this aint the case! Its alot of fun and I personally think more games should be like this. Youve alot of time to try to line up perfect turns and manuevers and when things go bad (as theyy often do with the way I drive) its great to see it unfold turn by turn.  The other thing that I hear alot of people dissing the game about, especially since the steam release, is the steep learning curve. Ive been playing for a long time and I still learn new ♥♥♥♥ all the time. On that same note: Im pretty acclimated to the way everything works so Im probably the wrong person to make an observation on this point. I can tell you though, If you stick around long enough to learn the ropes, this is an awesome strategy game.   Another great thing about this game is the community. The vets that Ive had the pleasure of sharing this game with are extremely helpful. Even the developer plays with us occasionally. Everyone tries to help new people too.

												Admittedly, I had played this game long before it arrived on Steam.Had a very successful gang that terrorized other player gangs.The UI and web combination is a little on the clunky side, the graphics, while not bad, do show their ageAt it's core the strategy mechanics are solid, not perfect, but solid.There are large amounts of customization to vehicles and characters, just beware of permadeath...  It is there, waiting for your characters and vehicles....Takes some adjustment, the short and mid game is quite fun.... long term... well that is an article all to itself.			",9,8,2,9,2,0,20

												I have no idea why I'm addicted to this game.The menus are hard to navigate, the physics are unreliable, and many of the mechanics are completely unexplained outside of the wiki. But still, I sometimes wake up on a morning with an itch, one I cannot scratch, I get an idea for a new racing build, or think of a way to better optimise a racing line, and the next time I am able, I reinstall Darkwind.I’ve been away for a while, all the money I previously earned has been spent on food and water to feed my gang, and many of them have radiation poisoning from resorting to contaminated supplies. A dozen races, and five hours later, my gang is no longer starving.I already have the parts I need for my new racing car design, but they’re split between two different towns, and neither of them house the racetrack I’m designing for. Three travel events, and two hours later, my shipments will arrive the following afternoon.But now I’ve sent all my gangers to the same location, and I now need to move a few of them in case there’s an event I want to go to in another town. After another four travel events, and three hours later, I realize it’s 6am, and I need to sleep before it’s time to wake up.Then someone says in chat that they’re going scouting in five minutes. After that, I notice I have a car lying around that’s perfect for an upcoming deathrace. And now my cars have returned from that scout, so I need to strip all the usable parts from the truck I scavenged. Oh god, I’ve just spent all my money on repairs and have to do some more races.I look at the time again, it’s almost noon… soon my parts will arrive for that car design, maybe after that the game will let me sleep.I have no idea why I’m addicted to this game.It’s needlessly complex, incredibly demanding, and sometimes the number of players online can be counted on one hand. But for some crazy reason, this might be the best game I’ve ever played.			",308,65,6,36,15,1,70

Add single player, insane car customization, customizable events with A.I and the multiplayer as a second mode!Single player doesnt need to be story, just make it a survival sandbox with just one person in your gang to start, then after awhile you could have hired 5 others and give them a car to drive along side the first car.Maybe have a real time option for singleplayer.Please see this devs, this game could easyly earn you guys alot of money if it would be payed.

												Darkwind is just one of those games that I keep coming back to, even after 5 years of playing.Let me just start by saying that this game is definitely NOT for everyone. It is based on the tabletop board game Car Wars of old. That means turn based, patient gameplay. You will need to be willing to give this game a significant amount of your time if you want to get the most out of it. First let me get the bad points out of the way; the UI isn't particularly friendly to new players, the graphics are very dated and you may come across the occasional bug in the game.That said, the pros vastly outweigh the cons. The community in this game is the best that I have seen from ANY online game. This goes a long way to counteract the hard-to-get-to-grips-with game client. Most people are happy to answer any questions that new players have (and there tends to be a lot of those) and specifically appointed 'marshals' (identified by a username parenthesised by '*'s) are experienced with the game and will take new players out on scouts.The depth of the gameplay in Darkwind is also second to none, and that is to the credit of the game's lone developer *Sam*. Premium players can have a gang filled with over 50 characters depending on the skill of their leader (mine currently has 57) and each character will be different depending on the skills you train them in. These characters can then be sent out on scouts, travel to different towns or used in town events. The perma-death in this game also makes you actually care about your characters, and mourn them when they're gone - because the aren't coming back.I've rage quit a few times, stopped playing for months because I've lost characters that were dear to me. But I always come back, because the game is worth it. This is a game that is constantly updated by a developer who cares not only for the game but for the community. Give it a chance and it'll reward you with an emotional rollercoaster and a drain on both your time and your resources. Don't blame me if your wife leaves with the kids because you are spending too long on this game after getting hooked.			",50,3,9,5,13,0,6

												This game has a fantastic turn based auto combat mechanic. The closest game you'll get to Car Wars. Realyl wish though this mechanic was used in a single player game. You could also add a Z axis and create a WW1 air combat game aswell. If I was the developer I'd be def making a single player game and a WW1 game (with Squadron management etc\RPG features)Back to the game, though I love the actual racing\combat and I'm sure if you have the time and subscribe to the main multiplayer element you'd find alot of depth I find I hardly play i. One I never subscribe to games and two the single player game is just abit restrictive. As I said make an indepth single player game I'd be playing it lots!So just for the combat mechanics I recommend you have ago.			",43,9,2,14,17,0,30

												I like this game for a few reasons. First, the gameplay is actually quite fun, I like it's turn based things, because that was unique to me. When it says ""Think a few moves ahead"" you really need to. I went into a turn, not planning the next 3 moves for the turn. I ended up hitting a wall, and stopping the whole race. One of my friends taught me the game, i'm just basically figuring out how to scout. Secondly, people say that switching through the web browser and through the game is quite stupid. If your lazy (like all the people who disliked because of that) this isn't your game. I was happy to learn that when you have no more gang members, its not game over, unless you have no money, which basically will not happen. The tutorial does give information about driving, which is helpful, but seek controls and help with other things, you just ask people. This is why I reccommend the game. Friend me. My gang is Da Tacocorns, user name is MrTacocorn. One more thing, if your nerdy like me, you can base a book off this game. ANywho. I rate this 8/10. Thanks.			",68,10,1,14,17,3,5

												Hurry up and wait to play to mostly with bots. This game was fun, but its turn based Deathrace mechanics with AI that takes a few seconds to go (130 turns for the first place finisher on a single lap loop) adds up. The game is facinating, but poorly delivers on its premise. You queue up for races that have upcoming start times which becomes downtime while you wait for the next event to begin. The most distracting aspect is how often the game loads the steam browser to faciliate aspects of the game rather than handling it within the client.This game is interesting, bring friends to laugh with you, but avoid if you are trying it out solo.

If you can find it in yourself to get past what many say are dated graphics and ""bad"" UI I am sure that you could have some fun with what Darkwind has to offer. I dont have much to say about this game besides it truly is a one of a kind game. never have I played a game like this one. If I were to describe it I would say it somewhat reminds me of turn based twisted metal game or something. Overall the biggest thing I did not like about the game was the UI, it feels really cluttered and will take some time getting used to.  In the end, all I can say is you should not skip trying this game just because of how it looks. Give it a chance and you may find yourself a game you really like.

												I have been playing Darkwind for almost 7 years. For starters, its a great community of players, and the Developer, Sam often takes player's input, art, and literature and implememnts it into the game. If you ever played Car Wars, this game is for you. There is a tremendous amount of things to do in the game. You can concentrate on the many town events such as Deathracing, Racing, Arena Combat,, and Pedestrain Combat, or you can wander out into the wastelands seeking wealth and fame, looting prized vehicles and weaponry. You can also manage your gang member's skills, specialisms, and even try and curve their bad drug habits by sending them to rehab. The game has several unique features, one of which is Permadeath. If your gang is fighting a bad battle, sometimes you have to ask yourself if it might be better to try and outrun your opponents rather than lose that prized gunner of yours... Also this game is turn based, so if your looking for constant button pushing in a short period of time, this game is not for you. Lastly, what this game lacks in graphics is made up in game depth. Don't download this game and play it for 2 minutes and base your opinion on the graphics, or you are going to miss out on a great game.			",1,6,1,4,3,0,4

												After my observation, this game is just not made for everyone. Some people cant get over the way this games works, and honestly, its quite a shame. Todays folks are used to sh*t they've seen already thousand times (COD LOL) and are not ready for something way more different, specific, complex and unforgiving like Darkwind. I used to play this game many years ago, when restrictions were so tight, you couldn't even own a car, nevertheless, with steam release, those limitations were removed and you get humongous amount of free content.Pros:+ Dynamic gameplay+ Complex trading and faction system+ Joining factions+ Unforgiving (when it comes to dying and losing cars)+ Long-Term+ Creating camps (didnt even get to that)+ Loads of chasseses (is that even a word?), weapons and engines to combine+ Turn-based (love it)+ Free to playCons:- UI (for some people might be unbearable, you'll get it eventually)- If you want all the stuff, you need to get premium (however, you can happily play without it and reach skyhigh)Just a little warning for all of you, this game causes a serious rage-quitting issues (parental advisory :D)			",124,7,3,21,7,1,32

												The idea of a car combat, turn based strategy game is interesting, and I am all for something different, but the game runs like a$$, especially on a new computer. What is funny? I can run this game on an older computer just fine, but just recently tried and it's choppy. Can't be an issue on my end. Also waiting to play a game is way too long, tried loading the tutorial, wouldn't load. The game is broken, and after 40 minutes or so, I said f**k it, I am done with it. Far better free to play games to play on here anyways. For those that enjoy it, I wish you the best.			",256,30,13,17,9,1,9

												Timeless classic.  I've been playing Darkwind for a long time before it came to Steam.  If you've played the table top game Car Wars, Darkwind is based loosely on this.  Turn based, but flows like real time pausable, you control a Mad Max style gang and watch them grow, train, become famous or infamous, get older if they're lucky, and eventually retire or die.  The cars/trucks that you aquire and equip with better and better weapons will enable you to reach deeper in the wastelands and eventually get even better gear... or end in complete financial disaster for your gang.  This game is a battle-game, RPG, financial simulator, all in one in a radiated distopian future.  If you've down voted this game, you haven't given it a proper chance to mature in your brain.  If you enjoy click fests, or first person shooters and nothing else, then move along.  This game requires some thought.			",14,8,3,11,45,0,17

												This is a slight recommend as this is a very niche game that will not appeal to most people.  It is also has a very unfriendly user interface and learning curve.The game is turn based, if you want to hop in a car, drive around however you want in real time, and blow stuff up, then go check out the Twisted Metal series or stuff like that, this isn't that.The graphics are old and not very good but functional.  The number of vehicles and weapons are pretty limited, even though this game has been live and active for years.  The gang and vehicle management is done via the website that is opened in an external browser.  The Free 2 Play aspects are not so limiting to a free player that you can't enjoy the game without having to pay as you get access to the 3 first major towns and most of the events take place there.So why the recommend? Gameplay.  If you are looking for a turn based Car Wars type game with real physics, this is your only option and a decent one.  I prefer turn based games that allow you to succeed via your wits not your twitch reflexes.  Again, the appeal for this game will be limited to a niche group, but if you feel that might be you, it is free to download and give it a try.			",100,36,7,67,36,6,23

												Typical ''pay to play' game. Without paying real money (quite often)  you play as clan of beggars in totally random and, unforgiving world plus have access to 10% area of it.You can lose all what you have (and earned for half year of playing) simply by bad luck. Game demands waiting for everything. I am not imatient but wait 4 REAL DAYS for my car to repair or 2 REAL WEEKS for one of my character to get back to health makes this game ideal for no lifers. Interface begs for mercy. AE to buy a weapons for your car you have to click on one place. To buy ammo, click on something totally different. And now try to guess where to repair your damaged gear.On the other hand: idea of the game and the game itself is very good. If not problems already mentioned I'd say it is one of best games I've ever played. If you like action paced games, where reflex is everything, dont even try to play this thing.At the end: This game has best, friendliest and most supportive community EVER.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Seems like a cool game.But when the tutorial makes you ask more questions since nothing is clarified in the tutorial. Well then the game can be amazing, but since you can’t understand it, then it does not matter.I made my own car cool. But I can’t use it in any races since; There is no races for that car type. Great.The first tutorial mission I should get 1000$ for jumping over a jump. I did actually over 20 times. But no mission clarification, and The tutorial had 240 rounds I was in 56 when I got bored of waiting. For some sort of acknowledge that I made the first part. Frack this game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Darkwind: War on Wheels is a multiplayer online, simultaneous turn-based game of vehicular combat. Set in a post-apocalyptic world, it involves physics-based tactical combat and deathracing, online leagues as well as cooperative wilderness scouting and looting, trading and camp-based crafting.  It worked, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok for a turn-based game, Car Wars and older graphics.  Try it, if you like Turn-Based games.  For more info:

												Where to begin? I wanted to like this game, I love the theme, the apparent table top inspired gameplay, the apparent depth... but there's just nothing here.First and foremost the UI is absolutly atrocious and painful to navigate. Menus hidden within menus, and none of it is very intuitive. This alone is unlikely to deter most potential players and if it was the only issue then it would be forgivable, however it merely sets the stage.The fundamental flaw of this game is the gameplay itself. It is a lie. There is no depth here.The gameplay is divided between events like racing and arena combat and then patroling which is where you will salvage vehicles and supplies.In a patrol evry combat encounter will play out exactly the same regardless of what vehicle you have. You will spawn into the map, the enemy will spawn behind you or facing you directly. If they spawn behind you, then you run, spin, form a firing line with the other players and then shoot as the enemy comes into range. If they spawn in front of you, you form a firing line and shoot as they come in range. Regardless of whether your car is a fast muscle car or an armor-plated SUV the tactics are the same. The physics in this game are pretty good, and if they actually gave the vehicles some decent speed and acceleration, and if the maps themselves and the enemy spawns where different then you could make use of the physics and actually take a tactical approach to the situation, but it is here that the game sabatoges itself. The encounters are lazy line battles and it gets lame quick.The races  have more to do with luck than the skill of the ""driver"" because there will inevitably be a giant crash and the winner is whoever manages to avoid it with the least loss of control. The death races are equally lame because they present little in the way of strategy. Once again it is mostly luck. Pulling ahead means you got shot in the rear by everyone behind you, hanging back means you run out of ammo after dispatching one racer. The best choice is to hang neck and neck with the drivers in the middle pack and hope those behind you target the adjacent races, meanwhile exploiting the firepower of those next to you in order to take out those in the lead. If you are very lucky then those behind you engaged other targets and those next to you are now too low on ammo to destroy you as you try to pull ahead. If the races were not all stock then perhaps some skill and much needed variety could be injected, as it is now though in an attempt to make things ""fair"" everyone is given the same vehicle and loadout and so we are left with a complete and utter mess. Apparently this game has a deep player driven economy and a few other features I missed because they are divided betweem the browser side of the game and/or hidden somewhere in the UI. This game has been out for a long while now, it still looks like crap, plays like crap, and shows no intention of fixing the core issues.The community is atually quite pleasant, though some of the more well known players and GMs are passive aggressive ♥♥♥♥♥.

												I came into this skeptical after seeing the page listing ""Mixed Reviews"" With so many bad instead of good reviews, However, I am now wondering if there are just a ton of troll reviews or what.I actually was plesantly supprised, The game, Though it seems very ""meh"" at first glance, I actually started to enjoy it more as I played it a bit longer,  I meant to only be on here an hour or two, but at 7.5 hours, and realising I have stayed up way too long, I must say this game has quite it's charm, A bit rough on the edges, but in an understandable way for a small Free to play game.The concept works well, and though it's a little hard to understand in a few ways, as well as some ""Real time for vehicle repairs"" stuff, IT's actually not that bad, and It seems to have a very friendly comunity, considering I had some take me on my first ""Scouting mission, and then got my first real vehicle from it rather then borrowing for races, then one gave me a second vehicle to use. It's a bit of a slow start but it's decently fun actually....Though I would reccomend making some friends while you play, or trying to play with friends so that way you can work together, and have fun.

												All in all, Darkwind can be very fun to play but without any future content or bug fixes, I can't recommend the time investment or to invest any money into the game. Don't expect to just hop into the game and understand the lobby or interface without asking questions in lobby chat or researching. Most of the veteran players are very friendly and helpful so don't be afraid to chat them up if you do decide to give it a shot. If you just want to play for free, you have nothing to lose. Only real limitation on free to play is you are stuck in Somerset, the beginning town. My guess is you will find this game entertaining for about a month or two of daily gaming if it is your cup of tea. If it isn't, you won't make it much farther than the tutorial before you uninstall.Positives:- Scouting is very fun, especially with other veteran players.- The game is hardcore and you can lose your vehicle(s) and gang quite easily, especially if you scout solo. It is not an easy or forgiving game, especially with unskilled gangers.Negatives:- Huge time investment to skill up gangers, to go scouting, to do pretty much anything.-The developer of this game, Sam, has moved on to bigger and better things. There will probably be no more content added to the game, there are skills like cycling that your characters have but cycles aren't even in the game and probably never will be put into the game. Do not spend any money on this game if you are hoping for serious improvements or ANY additional content added in the future. It is highly unlikely.- The game is very time consuming no matter what you do. Scouting takes a very long time usually and if you decide to do events, there are specific times when events in each town start so you may have to wait an hour or more for a specific event to start. Yes, you can start your own events once every 30 minutes, but the rewards are much less than the ones that are on timers.- There is a bug where the npc vehicles can shoot through the ground/terrain and hit you and when you shoot at them, you shoot the ground. You think you have positioned yourself in a good spot, only to get damaged or even killed due to this bug. VERY VERY ANNOYING OR EVEN GAME BREAKING. Why has this not been fixed? Probably because Sam doesn't care about this game anymore as he is too busy working on mobile games now.My ratings from 1(lowest) to 10(highest)Graphics - 5Sound - 4Gameplay/Control - 7Longevity/Playability - 6Overall Score - 6			",17,3,1,10,3,0,0

												It isn't too bad. The graphics is horrible but that is why it is unique at this time of 2014. It brings back old memories. Well back to the game it is quite interesting and you should give it a go. It may not look visually appealing but it is better than it looks. Don't judge a book by its cover! Give it a try people.

												I really want to like this game. It feels a lot like my old tabletop car wars days in the 80s, but after a month of trying and actually buying into the premium content I cannot recommend it to anyone that doesn't have a very high tolerance for abuse if not being an outright masochist.The game has potential, but it's broken in too many ways. It's AI is so stupid that to give the AI a fighting chance many events will have players so outnumbered that there is no way they could carry enough ammo to deal with all the targets.On top of the shoddy AI, it's riddled with bugs, some totally game breaking and many which will result in the losses to the player, and the developer is a full time college professor so he's really not putting any time into dealing with the game abusing players or even to fix the bugs or finish including content that was clearly planned from day 1.After three major losses to bugs, once to a driver dying and a ride being almost totally trashed because the front scraped the ground on a bump... a bus suddenly launching into the air and landing on it's side... and today an encounter 'Trucing' (meaning you supposedly made peace and avoid the conflict) not once but twice and then still making me fight it, in all costing me far too much to just dismiss as ""Meh, stuff happens.""Also, it's very unfriendly and borders on pay to win.Can't recommend it, tired of feeling abused by it, not expecting it to get any better anytime soon, and done giving it any of my time.If you decide you are thick skinned and highly tolerant and want to try it anyway, I highly recommend not paying a dime into the premium content until you have gangers that have months of training under their belt because the premium content is not for new characters and most of the veteran players there will just ridicule you if you complain... Heck, they will ridicule you if you bring up bugs, because the game has a large number of callous fanboys that think it's perfect in it's currently buggy (but apparently very exploitable by experienced players) condition.PS: The icing on the cake for my leaving and where the real need to be thick skinned lies is in the Troll riddled community. There are a handful of fanboys that will simply troll anyone they don't like out of the game... When I tried to discuss the issues the main heart of the review focuses on in their technical forum I got flamed for pages, one of the flamers following me to a forum post here on Steam and generally the last straw was a toxic community around the game and once again a developer that simply does not care about what is actually going on with his game.

												I Highly do not suggest this game it's tedious, slow and the controls are horrible. The online play is slow the game is laggy and the big takiling tutourial head scares the living daylight out of you! I suggest turning the volume off as this game has the worst audio I have ever heard it's the same repeditive loop of the same thing. But I did quite enjoy the Idea and the carnage but it wasn't enough to save the game I would give the game 4 out of 10!			",7,1,1,1,6,1,1

												This game is actually the best. Gr8 driving mechanics, graphics to rival Star Citizen. A huge open world bigger than Skyrim. A gr8 Mad Max style setting. A story which I was hanging off every word of the quest givers dialogue, also has a rich backstory. Your build relationships with everyone of your gang members and all of them are useful when doing anything. It contains a fantastic first person mode and you can even target the guns from this view! The scenery is beautiful and includes, deserted skyscrapers, huge termite mounds in the desert that stretches as far as the eye can see. There are no microtransactions so I have no idea how this game came to be. If you build a team of other players you can combine and a transformers/power rangers style way to take down whole buildings in one hit and then you get to see the levelution.In short this game is the best of all time it perfectly combines the gameplay aspects from driving games, shooters, MMOs, RPGs and open world games. It is incredibly underrated and comepletely free with a tiny download time (assuming you have decent internet). This game is astoundingly perfect in every way. It is gr8 m8 I would r8 8/8 no deb8 go and order a (free) cr8, it will s8 your desire for a gr8 game.LOL jk this game is absolutely crap don't get it.			",85,8,1,11,7,0,3

In case I'm not being clear; you move the steering wheel, then tell the game to move, and the car moves 5 feet. Then you move the steering wheel, then tell the game to move, and the car moves 5 feet.  Then you move the steering wheel, then tell the game to move, and the car moves 5 feet....

I dont believe that the gameplay is very unique as many people claim. I feel like this game is very familar and is reminiscent of  old warcraft 3 mods. But for a game to come out in 2014 in this style is unacceptable. This game would be descent if there was an easier matchmaking system that is inviting.

Very bad UI. Very long wait times. Walls of text. I wish this game would work, but it doesn't, not for me, not yet.			",35,43,1,0,5,1,2

												You spend like 20 minutes just getting into the game. You don't get to change your password and they have a ♥♥♥♥ manual.The graphics are worse than almost all games. with the exception of the overcomplicated rereleases of 2001 games thanks to steam. I havent spent much time on the game but I have a couple mates with 10+ hours. One enjoys it one agrees with me.I can see how people can enjoy the game but in my opionon it is just another of steams crappy 2001 re releases.			",96,6,2,9,12,3,24

												Couldn't find one thing to like about it.Alot of nonsense to look at and waste more of your time.In game is laced with too many bugs to deal with.Their customer service is about as useless as trying make conversation with a brick wall as they were sent several e-mails and they never replied to one.Overall i'd say its just a failure of game and their support team is even more pathetic.Its probably nothing more but a fool's attempt at making a buck.

												... Seemed good, the tutorial got me interested, but the lack of people playing means not many games are being set up.  On top of this if you sit idle for five minutes the Server drops you and you must wait 30 second to log back in.  This gets old, fast.  I wasn't able to get to the gameplay because of the lack of players wanting to start the game.     Edit: On top of this review I've been getting flamed/trolled by people that play the game because I wrote this review!  I've already uninstalled it and I do not want to be apart of the player group either because of the content in the comments I've deleted.			",68,8,3,11,11,2,18

												Dont get me wrong Im not against turn based combat but it a demolition derby game? This is not innovative and it is repetitive to say the least, heck I only played for 6 minutes and I was already bored. The music is in one word awful. Graphic on cars can be considered passable at best. The environments and textures are laughable. We shouldn't accpept bad games just because they're free. The best possible way i can descibe this game is so bad that it will make you laugh for a few minutes. If you are looking for a decent free game with more appealing gameplay and charm I suggest the Expendabros or You Have to Win The Game.  Darkwind may be free but it is honestly not worth waiting a minute and a half for it to download.			",24,4,1,1,2,1,0

The graphics resemble the old PS1 destruction derby games, with ♥♥♥♥♥ier 'plots'.

												Very fun turn based strategy game. It's quite unique in just about any way. I don't know of any other  turn based full physics vehicular combat MMO. It's definitely not everyone's cup of tea, and unfortunately the community is slowly dying. I remember the joy of getting my first Buzzer and the subsequent frustration when it was blown up two missions later.I remember setting a teammate's expensive Ambulance on fire by accident and watching it blow up a few turns later. They never talked to me again.The memories I made in this game are priceless, and was well worth the cost of strugging to learn how to play and almost losing everything during the first few hours of my gameplay.This game had a lot of potential. If there ever will be a sequel with better graphics, interfaces, and a bigger playerbase, I know I'll be hooked once more.			",191,15,6,8,11,0,34

												New and interesting concept, adn it's nice to see developers searching for different games to refresh the appetites of gamers, however i felt the game was too clunky and also the way the controls are designed is just not good. I respect that it may be under develpoment and with the help of updates the clunkiness will disappear, however i just feel that the idea of the game being turn-based will not work, maybe if the turns were longer it might be enjoyable but as it is the game doesn't seem like it will work. Many things seem promising, but the lack of flowing gameplay and combine that with the frankly poor menu i feel the game will need a lot of work because it is truly playable/P.S I don't mean for this review to be to scathing, but i just feel the game could be so much better than it is, not just if it had more time I think the developers just need to take a step back  and think about where their going with the game.

												Like games from the 80's? well here it is with the terrible matchmaking system you get to wait 10 mins to get a game and if your 10 secconds late (yep you must be at the pc waiting) you dont get to play and get to wait even longer YAY so fun much win. interface kills the game the tutorial for gameplay is ok, if you count the fact that all ui overlaps the chatbox to know what you are doing. BUT THATS IT it shows you how to play but not how to get into a match for that you must go into a browser and wiki how to do it. Its 2014 not the 80s i would not tell anyone to ever play a game where IN GAME it tells you to use youtube and wiki to figure it out this game is for some weird nerdy crowd as far as i can see. the game runs well as it should tho, again looking like its from the 80s i dont care about good looking games as long as they work problem is this game does not do that.      im not a review person by any stretch ot the means and i tend to be open to all games but the community telling me im a ""dumbass"" for not understanding how schedualed matchs is fun is laughable. 0/10 i would play superman 64 over this.
