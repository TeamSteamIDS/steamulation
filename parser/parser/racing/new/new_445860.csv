Early Access Review
								I waited for this game for quite a while. I wasn't sure what to think of it when i first saw it, because I'm a big fan of real war planes and I was afraid that this game wouldn't satisfy me need for planes in VR.On the other hand I loved Toy Commander on Dreamcast, so I gave it a shot.I was surprised in a very positive way when i first played it! It has a beginner friendly but also very satisfying fly physic with the ability to do complex maneuvers.DOGFIGHTS ARE VERY INTENSE.I fought against friends and it was very intense. Fighting against the AI is a good training. Aiming is easy and the level design features a lot of interactive elements like shootable blocks, balls or even slot cars.MY PERSONAL FAVORITE IS THE RACING MODE.Dogfights are intense but once i tried the racing mode, I found this even better. I raced against 2 other players and it was incredible intense. Three planes racing towards a narrow hohle where just one of us will fit through? Oh yeah. :)Summary of Pros/Cons of the current Early Access release:+ Immersive, gigantic looking rooms/apartments (a great feeling of beeing tiny)+ Lovely detailed planes (that woman in the double decker <3)+ Intense Dogfights + Awesome Racing Mode- No ingame Voice Chat to chat with the Team - In Racing Mode all players should choose the same planes because some are superior regarding top speedI'm looking forward to the upcoming maps and planes!

								First of all : I love this game! It's one of the best VR Games out there at the moment, and incredibly advanced for an early access game!So now im gonna explain why exactly i love this game :1. Gameplay :The gameplay is pretty simple. You fly a plane, and shoot other planes.But one point, wich a lot of plane games f*ck up is done incredibly well in Toy Plane Heroes : The controls.They are very responsive, and very easy to understand and master. You use one stick, to rotate the plane around it's own axis, and the other one to turn your plane left or right.To accelerate you just press RB (on an Xbox controller), and to brake you press LB.Shooting is done by pressing the triggers, one for each weapon.Where you shoot is depending on where you look. The two elements of steering your plane with the controller, and aiming your shots with the head makes the whole game very complex and deep, while it's still easy enough for people who know how to handle controllers! (If you're not a gamer though, you shouldn't start gaming with this game...)2. The GraphicsI can't say too much about the graphics, because this game has a toy... -ish(?) style to it, so of course it isn't hyper realistic. But overall the graphics are really good! They do exactly what they're supposed to be, the textures have a very good resolution, and the whole toyish look comes across great!Also, the style makes for relatively low graphics requirements, which is pretty good!3. The motion sicknessSo, for a plane game you would probably expect a lot of motion sickness, but, even though i get motion sick pretty quick, i can play this game for long periods of time without a lot of motion sickness! The only two times when i really get sick are 1. when i fly loopings (wich is understandable), and 2. when i get shot and my plane tumbles down. Because of the rapid movement, wich i can't control, it's really hard to look at. But after like 3 times, i just instinctively closed my eyes, which basically eliminates this problem.So overall this game is just awsome! I just recommend playing it for yourself. Especially with friends, it's awsome. Though, the bots are also very fun to play against.Overall im giving a rating of 8.5/10			",186,31,3,14,18,1,11

								Absolutely brilliant! Smooth xbox controls, fun aireal combat and seeing my brother looking behind him in his plane and nodding is just beyond everything. This was my very first multiplayer VR experience, and it was awesome! Thank you so much for creating this game! It runs as a dream here on my DK2 and CV1. Highly recommended and I'm eagerly awaiting updates!For those complaining about nausea, I experienced none of it, and I have only medium VR-legs. Might have to do with your settings, because it ran perfect for me (which cannot be said about some other games, blegh).Edit: I had a demo at work a while ago and several people spent some time flying around in VR, getting shot down by easy AI's and doing loopings only to get stuck in lamps and under the bed. They all LOVED it, and no-one got sick at all. This only strengthens my belief that settings might be a problem for some people. Recentering when in the plane can also help a lot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The game is cute and accessible and a lot of fun. I was up and flying in seconds and I even configured my HOTAS and was able to use it without any trouble. The game looks very promising. I recommend it. One downside: I never experienced motion sickness in my life until I played this game. Yikes!  I don't think it's the game's fault, though.  ",133,31,3,16,23,4,33

								Very dizzy experience deserving of the Intense Rating for sure ! Game is nice & colourful but there is only 3 rooms and they get old very quickly - they are adding a Supermarket soon but really there needs to be many more play areas added,  12 total would be a good number. I played in short bursts at different times thru the day and never once found anyone online at all in Australia, so I would say if you want MP this game is not ready as you can only go against Bots.  The game also desperately needs to have some good Sound effects implemented, the aircraft & weapon noise is very basic and the Oculus Dimensional & Positional sound is not used at all. There is one music tune playing which you will want to turn off after 5 minutes. Difficult to fully recommend although it has great potential,  I would say wait until a Steam sale, value is more around $6.49 not $12.99. Rate 5/10.			",10,0,8,0,4,0,0

								A really fun game!I simply love the scale of everything, you fell so small and that makes it even more fun. You actually feel like a tiny toy and seriously, is there anybody out there, who never dreamed of being a toy and do all the cool stuff? Luckily the maps are very imaginative, that suits you're heights and the adventure.The controls can be altered, which comes in handy, though you can't change the way you aim (I wouldn't change that anyway since that's a way even noobs like me can hit stuff).I really recommend the game, it's tons of fun and fairly easy to get into.

								This is a cute game with a lot of potential, but for those who are prone to motion sickness it is a no go at the moment (I guess the ""VR COMFORT: INTENSE"" warning is a VERY honest assessment in that respect). I would love to see a control scheme more like Anshar Wars 2 (for the Gear VR), where you use the headset to control your craft's motion and the controller to aim your weapon - that makes games like this MUCH more tolerable in VR, as the motion of your head better matches what your eyes are seeing, thus decreasing feelings of disorientation and nausea (I feel none whatsoever in Ashar Wars 2 and none in general on most VIVE games). If at all possible, PLEASE incorporate that as an alternate control scheme to make this game more accessible to a wider range of people, including myself.And as a side note, the game runs flawlessly on my system (GeForce 980 Ti x2 and core i7-5930 @ 4.0 GHz with a SSD on MSI Godlike board), so specs/settings have nothing to do with it. It is the disconnect between the visual stimulus and what the vestibular canals of the inner ear are sensing. Add the alternate control scheme I suggested, and it will be way more comfortable. ;)			",185,25,6,6,30,5,11

								I freakin love this game! It is such an intense and cool feeling to fly a little plane in a toy story world! I was sceptical when I read the few reviews about motion sickness, because I sometimes get it with other games but here I did not experience it at all. Excellent work! The game is really varied. So even if people are likely to get motion sickness, there are different ways to play the game now. I highly recommend it! Even with bots it is awesome!			",47,4,0,7,3,0,4

								looked fun, loved Toy Commander on Dreamcast so was excited to try this.Unfortunatly its extremely nauseating, played plenty of flight / space sim type games with my DK2 never had an issue, but this made me feel as sick as a dog, even slight movements of the plane caused my stomach to contract in anticipation of chunder chunks, played 10 mins before i couldnt take any more, spent rest of the day feeling like crap...will not play it again.

								Game shows a lot of promise and potential.Cannot reccomend as is though (6/15/16) only one(?) map consisting of a hallway and four rooms. Needs more maps, better sounds (no engine noises? really?) and as others have stated, this game is the roughest motion-sickness inducing game I've played in my month of oculus ownership (and I spend hours at a time in Elite: Dangerous. War thunder and DCS dont bother me either). Even in the planes with more of a cockpit (which are supposed to help cut down on sickness)I love the idea, and I'll definitely check back in a few updates			",194,23,4,31,18,2,22
