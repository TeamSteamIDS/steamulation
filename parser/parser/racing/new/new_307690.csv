												After the 100% completion I can say that:When it comes to visual differences the Definitive Edition features better lighting, character models and textures, some improved world textures, more depth of field, smoke, smoother reflections and visual effects. In short, the game feels more organic.Now you have more people and cars on the screen. I've noticed new faces, different outfits and generally better looks.The keyboard keys were remapped to more standard layout. Notable changes:-RMB to E (entering cars, countering).-Space to L.Shift (sprint and parkour).-RMB now is used for lock-on.The game mechanics are mostly the same. HUD has been slightly revamped, making elements sharper, smaller. Phone's front and UI has been changed completely. Most of the icons have been changed. Main menu has activity feed now and you can switch between social hub entries without the need to wait until they load.The car traffic AI is okay-ish, heavy trucks still scratch the walls on turns, but I've noticed that the AI sometimes keeps crashing into my parked cars. Car physics are semi-buggy. There have been cases of weird spawns and semi floating vehicles.Pedestrian AI needs a bit of polishing. I've experienced bunch of harmless / hilarious bugs and glitches:-Some individuals keep walking into other people as if they were walking into a wall. -Friendly AI had problems entering my car / locating door when needed.-Some thugs were levitating for a brief moment.-Panicking thugs tried to escape, got in a car and kept driving into a wall (they try to back off, but still hit the exact same spot).-Enemy reinforcements sometimes get stuck between cars or they keep looking at you from afar.-Random guy upstairs in Club Bam Bam went through the floor and landed on the ground floor like it was nothing.-Some pedestrian animations keep overwriting themselves (loop too early) and end up looking like they're having a stroke.-Sometimes people get spawned above the water.-Some people get stuck in walls.I've also noticed some audio issues. Sometimes some sound effects aren't played or they randomly appear / disappear. Seems like some audio bits also get either delayed or overlap (especially noticeable if happens during dialogues). Even had 2 radio tracks playing at the same time.I'd like to point out that camera needs tweaking too. Sometimes it doesn't center well, stucks in things or points at wrong angles, has weird sensivity. Especially noticable in action hijacks.I didn't experience these issues in original patched SD.The DLC content is nicely implemented into the main game. You do not get instant access to the items (which would ruin the experience and challenge like in the original SD), instead you can access them in shops (the clothes guy says wacky lines about individual sets), so in-game currency has extra use now. The NANP and YOS side stories are available directly at the main menu, no need to switch between them. The red envelopes are now scattered all around the map and can be found in semi-hidden places. Notable difference: most of the DLC related side missions can only be played once, not including Zodiac island.SWAT Pack DLC's unlimited side missions were turned into ""Cop Job"". No need to travel in a HKPD vehicles, the missions are marked separately on your map and unlock based on your progression. Possible scenarios (possible spoilers):-You raid, beat up and arrest street gangs while having a bunch of officers as a backup.-You're given a vehicle and have to ram the escaping suspect's car, then arrest him.-You respond to store shootouts and neutralize thugs.-Sharpshooting / one shot kill the thug without harming the hostage.There are also some modified individual side missions (possible spoilers):-""High Speed"". Imagine Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit. You've given a police car and your goal is to shutdown a race by slamming into racer cars.-Modified ""Death by a Thousand Cuts"". Arena fighting with a golden meat cleaver. Enemies have poisoned weapons and your goal is to survive and kill 30 enemies.  it's quite hardcore, especially if you haven't upgraded anything.-Modified ""Shaolin Showdown"". Defeat 40 monks. Up to 30 on screen.The optimization is even better than in the original. Playable on higher resolutions with less performance hits.Notable difference: you can Alt+Tab freely. The game doesn't go into windowed mode anymore and stays in full screen, there's no need to change options back every time (which was extremely annoying).Final verdict:Worth if you've never (for some reason) played the game before.Otherwise for fans that enjoyed the game.PS. Needs a lot of patching. The bugs add up even if they're semi harmless.I may update this review if we discover some new ""facts"".			",542,173,16,75,59,7,102

What is it?A story-driven action adventure set in a gorgeously recreated Hong Kong setting (a mix of various Hong Kong sectors fairly accurately recreated).  The game is based on real events (though names have been changed).  You are Wei Shen, and you lead a double life as a Triad gang member and an undercover cop - so you will be playing both sides of the story.  It is Wei's job to bring down the Sun On Yee gang (a tweaked name of the real-life 'Sun Yee On') from the inside, and so he must find a way in, and get people to trust him.  Soon, Wei starts to feel divided loyalties as he gets in deeper and deeper.  The main storyline is linear but the plot is fast-paced and entertaining.  There are masses of side missions that fit in with the plot very well and you can choose when and if to play these. Sleeping Dogs contains all the usual open-world elements we love: a gorgeously atmospheric and thriving city densely populated with people and traffic, great ambience (especially the night market), vehicles to unlock and drive (or simply steal), USEFUL collectibles that either upgrade your health and strength, or your bank balance!  Is it easy to play?Very.  The driving and parkour elements are simple and responsive and the martial arts moves are only taught gradually and are not overly complex, though you might find yourself scribbling down a few moves as there are ultimately 12 to remember!  The game's tuition system spreads your learnt moves gradually through the game using a novel system of returning to Wei's former Kung Fu school.  For exchange of each school's missing trophies, you will be taught a new move and given some non-aggressive adversaries to practise it on.  It works very well.  As for weapons combat, I personally found it easier to switch to mouse for aiming, but the game switches seamlessly between controllers while playing.  The only negative aspect is the sometimes-uncontrollable camera angles after reversing a vehicle.  The camera is too slow to face forward, meaning you often start driving blindly.  Other than this, everything is great.RequirementsRegarding game requirements, you really will need to pay attention to those because this is a heavy game graphically.  There is some stutter in the cut-scenes regardless of GPU but the cut-scenes are only occasional.  You will benefit greatly from a gamepad.  This is not the sort of game for people who have a 'delicate' audience in the room as there is a lot of 'colourful' language and such.    If you're a female gamer, you'll probably cringe at some of the lines spoken by some women (some are really bad!) - but not enough to kill enjoyment of the game.Is it worth upgrading from the original?If you enjoyed the game enough that you'd likely play it through again, then I'd say yes.  It looked great before but there are a plethora of improvements: denser NPCs and traffic, heaps more variety in shop signs, lots more lit signs, beautiful environment effects, super-realistic road and building textures and improved controls.  A few bugs in the original game have been fixed, and all the cars, outfits, apartments and cash DLC is no longer automatically awarded to you at the beginning of the game (a problem with the original version, leaving players with nothing further to play for).  The only caution is that, if your PC struggled a bit with the original, it will struggle more with this version given that it is a much heavier game for your GPU.			",238,117,21,21,132,3,67

												Sleeping Dogs is a nice blend of several different game genres, and while none of them are anything new or groundbreaking, everything generally played well. The original (non-definitive) version is one of the few games I have 100% completion on in my steam library.Since you can read up on pretty much any review for the actual game, I thought I'd focus on what's new for this re-release.The biggest improvement probably went into how the dlc was handled. Every single dlc (with the exception of the top dog booster packs) is now included, and rather than just dumping them all on you at once, they were all was integrated into the game a little better, unlocking a few pieces from each as you progress through the story. While some of the changes are minor, like a new vendor in the night market who sells some of the dlc costumes, they actually went back and tweaked a few of them to flow better. For example, the ""Shaolin Showdown"" side mission is no longer an endless arena where you fight until you die, but now has you running to several locations fighting smaller groups of enemies, eventually climaxing into one of the largest melee fights in the entire game. The Swat dlc missions were also changed into individual ""Cop missions"" that feel like they have a little more variety now and unlock over time instead of all at once. In fact, almost every mission got some sort of small tweak to it. However, Nightmare in North Point and Year of the Snake are still separate standalone stories that don't take your progress in the main story into account (though they both still unlock a few bonus items for the story when completed).The graphics also got a bit of an upgrade, though it's not immediately obvious because the original PC game was already a big improvement over the 360/ps3 versions. Mostly, everything now has even higher-resolution textures, and there are some new effects like fog in the streets, remodeled skin and hair for most characters that looks great in cutscenes, more dense vehicle and pedestrian traffic, and some new outdoor effects. In particular, the new rain effect (and the puddles it leaves on the street) looks fantastic.If you never played Sleeping Dogs, you really owe it to yourself to pick up this re-release, as it fixes some of the flaws of the original and includes all the dlc. However, if you already played the original and most of its dlc, you should probably skip this. Improvements and dlc aside, there is no new content (mission or story-wise) whatsoever.

												Because this is the same exact game as Sleeping dogs, my review for this game is also the same copy pasted text except now it's in 1080p high definition letters.Seriously if you own the original game and all the DLC's do not buy this one. If you don't own this game, buy it, it's amazing.Wonderful game. Looks like GTA and Yakuza had a child and it’s turned out to be awesome.Sleeping dogs owns GTA4 in every way. I was forcing myself to finish GTA4 and enjoyed Sleeping dogs twice (on PS3 and after couple of years on Steam) and even collected all the achievements.Firstly the graphics are much better, GTA4 looks like crap and sleeping dogs looks great and when it’s start to rain it looks amazing. Sleeping dogs runs much MUCH better too while GTA4 is barely playable and bad looking even on high end machines.The gameplay is much more fun than broken GTA4, where controls are pathetic, shooting is frustrating, cars are bouncing, etc. This is not existent in Sleeping dogs. Controls are really good except for some rare camera issues. Driving is fun, especially shooting while driving and hijacking. And shooting mechanics is great, it’s easy to target the enemy, shoot him in the head, hide behind cover or disarm the enemy.The fighting system, is something like Yakuza. There are some combos which you learn by levelling up, you can use environment and knives, cleavers or even umbrellas, purses and my favourite – a fish to kill people. Side missions are not boring unlike in some other games, most of them are different every time. Catching the thieves, throwing out the drunks from the shop, collecting debts, stealing cars or find the lady in a car’s trunk and free her only to find out that it’s some sexual game and she was waiting for her husband to find her, not you.The story is good too. As undercover cop you must infiltrate the triad and bring them down. So you play as a cop and as a gangster depending on the mission. Sometimes it’s just driving, sometimes fighting or some bloody shootout.Oh and the game have radio with a different genre of music. My favourite is roadrunner records station. It has such bands like Machine head, Dream theatre, Soulfly and Trivium. It’s really fun to kick some teeth while Fear factory’s edgecrusher is playing :) The only downside of this game for me is that it lacks activities. After playing Yakuza games which has a bunch of activities I want more of them in other games too. The only activities are ♥♥♥♥ fights, races and mah-jong. Because of this I’m giving this game 9/10 :)			",698,388,38,103,107,5,116

												Pros:- Beautiful scenery, especially at night- FIghting mechanics are great (not limited to buton mashing)- Cool vehicles- Crazy physics- Massage parlours- Pork buns (to become a whole man)- Night markets (they even simulate the annoying pestering of DVD sellers wow)- Enables players to be fluent in Cantonese swearing- Cool old chinese instrumental music when you enter the dojo (my mum once told me to stop playing to just let her listen to the music, which made me leave Wei Shen staring at those 4 dudes awkwardly while the music played)Cons:- The scenery sometimes seem to be a bit blurry but not too blurry to turn you off tho- Hot girls you can't have sex with (dammit)Overall, I love the game, love the missions, love how intense the gameplay is even though we have to admit they're pretty cliche from time to time...If you live in a family that understands Cantonese, please wear headphones while you're playing this game.You wouldn't want the kids in your house to start saying ""diu lei lou mou"" and ""ham ka chan"" and ""pok gai"", trust me.So no h8 m8 i r8 this game 8/8			",23,0,0,2,1,0,3

												(Review simply based on additions and improvements, not the game itself.)- Improved Graphics- Sharper looking text and interface- Increased the ammount of pedestrians and cars- Pedestrians now look a lot more varied (alternate clothes, different faces)- All DLC's included- Sound and audio has improved- Physics has improved- Driving is smoother- Special places to buy DLC outfits- New billboards and signs seen around the city- City feels more alive (More people eating in the Golden Koi, people taking photo's, police investigating crime scenes, etc)The only cons I have seen so far are not game breaking but as follows;- Tiny glitches such as people and objects stay static in the air for a few seconds if hit- Cars seem to crash into you more often even when parkedThe game is a nicely polished version of the original. Mostly for fans of the original game who want to up their experience a little or for those who want all the DLC for a decent price. Either way, fantastic game made better.			",286,61,4,39,16,2,19

												I only bought this game, because I live in Shanghai and I thought it would be nice to play a GTA-like game in an environment I'm familiar with. The city in this game is Hong Kong only in name. The city itself does not look like Hong Kong at all (I travel to HK a lot so I would know), so this might as well be Shanghai. The attention to detail in this game is mind blowing. I mean, sure the game elements (story, gameplay, fighting, racing, etc) are fine and entertaining, but what I really like the most about this game are the people. The main characters and especially the people on the street are so authentic and believable! I just love it! From obvious chanting of the street vendors to the not so obvious nose drilling sound before spitting, loud chewing with open mouth or the way people talk (even if translated into English). This is just my personal opinion of the game. If you are Chinese or if you have visited Hong Kong/Shanghai, get this game and have a good time! But since there's a better choice (GTAV), get this game when it's on sale. By now the full price is not worth it.

												Look at Watch Dogs. Now at this game. Now back to Watch Dogs. Now back to this game. Sadly Watch Dogs aren't nearly as well-optimized, while offering marginally (very marginally) better graphical fidelity. Also Watch Dogs doesn't have an amazingly authentic city of Hong Kong with TONS of cultural education content. Neither does it have an interesting unique combat system, phenomenal voice acting, great satisfying driving with action hijacking, actually meaningful and clever hacking minigame (ironic, right?), a lot of variety in mission types and gameplay and a good storyline with actual emotions and some seriously shocking scenes.Sleeping Dogs Definitive edition is definitely a definitive Open World Action game in a well-defined location, with a defiant for the genre, yet great combat system and the very definition of what a GTA-style game should be. Definitely. Incredible game. EFG have delivered in full. Wholeheartedly recommend.			",127,14,1,13,4,0,3

												""That is what worries me, Wei. That you have become one of them.""As the store page for the vanilla game is only available for the DLCs it's best to summarise what Sleeping Dogs is for the newcomers. In case you only wish to know what the Definitive Edition can offer please scroll down further where I detail its characteristics.Sleeping Dogs, in essence, is GTA in Hong Kong. You have a living, breathing city with hundreds of pedestrians, drivers and bad guys. Into this world comes Wei Shen, an undercover cop so that he can infiltrate the triads and end their reign once and for all. You are free to go wherever you wish in the city. Once you approach shining beacons at certain spots a mission is initiated which is introduced by a cutscene. This is the linear, the story part of the game and once a mission is complete you are back in Hong Kong where you can participate in racing events, do favors for citizens, bet in a cockfight, hack cameras, complete missions for the police, purchase clothing and vehicles. The activities are numerous not to mention the many collectibles scattered throughout the city: you can pay your respects at health shrines, collect lockboxes and red envelopes full of cash and you can look for jade statues to learn new moves from your old kung fu master. Oh, and you can date girls and participate in karaoke sessions, as well!The story of Wei Shen is excellent and full of intrigue, treachery and some surprises. Voice acting is excellent but why would anyone think differently: as soon as you hear the voice of Tom Wilkinson or James Hong you know the game will deliver! As opposed to GTA, in Sleeping Dogs emphasis is on the melee combat (attacks, heavy attacks and counters - rinse and repeat) but from time to time you can get hold of several firearms, too. I like how you can utilise the environment to ease a battle: enemies can be thrown into dumpsters or into a whirling fan where they are met with gruesome death. Both combat and car handling are smooth and fast!The 2 DLC stories that can be accessed from the main menu do not offer anything interesting, however, putting these aside in-game content requires you to devote at least 30-40 hours if you wish to reach 100% completion.The Definitive Edition:-- This edition gives you the full package with all DLCs included. Red envelopes are put elsewhere and some missions have been changed. In fact, the DLC clothing are now sold by a special vendor near the market area. Perhaps the most notable of this inclusion are the unique cop missions where you always assist your fellow officers (you need to hit and ram enemy vehicles or gun down bad guys or save a hostage).-- The game has better effects and higher resolution textures. Or so they say. The former are noticeable and for a city known for its ""light pollution"" it is a must, to be honest. In fact, there are more pedestrians on the streets so you can really feel being in Hong Kong.-- With all the graphics enhancements the game is still not demanding much: 60 FPS result is common, in fact, the game runs better on my rig than the original version did.-- With new features come new bugs: audio issues (overlapping) here and there and due to the more NPCs on the streets you notice more of them get stuck at certain places for no apparent reason. Still, these are all minor nuances.-- The game now has better keybindings. I know these can be changed in the controls menu but I always appreciate if the developers pick the applicable buttons per default. This layout now makes more sense.To use a pun I am happy to say this edition is a definitive must! As I had already had the vanilla game in my library I got a 50% special promotion for this super package - I believe this is nice so for me this edition was an immediate purchase.

The streets of Honk Kong are too narrow and crowded for proper racing, sure it's illegal racing but come on...at least remove the cars and breakeable entities for a proper racing track? Damn-Minor bugs, easily fixable, doesn't mean they can't be annoyingConclusionIf you can overlook the bugs and bloke driving system the game is great and intense, I highly recommend this game for those who played GTA and likes some good ol' fighting :3			",23,7,0,4,2,1,1

												This game is really good this second time around!!! Updated shaders and materials and a lot of optimizations have been made for better performance. (Higher Framerates, etc.)Gameplay Pros: - Parkour - Street races - A very interesting story (nothing totally original, but good) - Fun combat situations - Ka-ra-tay - Decent selection of cars to buy and driveGameplay Cons: - Annoying car physics, I say this because when you hit a cardboard box on the side of the road, the entire front of your car is mangled. The cars handling is ok... It's really how they deal damage and how they act on the road. (Ex: Pot hole = Fly into a doom pit pretty much) - Dialog, when a bad guy talks in a cut scene *SPOILER* Like when ""Smiley's"" men attack the Golden Koi, the gangster has a gun on Ms. Chu, his dialog makes you want to laugh... it's like ""FAK YU BICK I GOTTA FIE DALLA YU GIB ME DA SHET.""   xD - WHY PEGGY.

												+ Impressive graphics; particularly well done are the exterior urban environments+ Suberb voice-acting+ Gorgeous weather effects; you can even see steam rising from the pavement after a fresh rain+ Melee fighting mechanics are satisfying and intuitive+ Vehicles are well-designed, of sufficient variety, and handle well; the racing missions in this game (not something I'm usually a fan of) are extremely entertaining+ Freerunning/Parkour (whatever you want to call it) system is simple enough that it adds to the game, but doesn't come off as frustrating+ The story is engrossing and well-written; not necessarily anything original in content, and there are no significant surprises, but it is delivered so well that you will be very invested with the characters and their relationships (the character developement, too, is very, very  well done)+ Variety of outfit customization, including several cheeky cameos from other popular franchises- There are lots of cookie-cutter NPC models- Plot is linear, in that your choices will not affect the outcome- Firearm mechanics are easily this game's weakest point; they are clunky and poorly-implementedLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit ",195,26,1,22,22,0,22

												Sleeping Dogs is one of those rare games that everybody loves, and every recommend to each other, but somehow no one has ever played it ( as far as you know).So I picked it up during a sale after it had been sitting on my wish list for a long time, and wow. I get it now.Sleeping Dogs is an incredible open world game, unique, lovingly crafted, and expertly written. Does it have its faults? Of course it does, as any game does, but the risks it takes, and the ways it succeeds far outweigh any nitpicking.Protagonist Wei Shen is an interesting, layered, and complex main character, in a world and surrounded by characters that are just as complex as he is.The story about Hong-Kong Triads is very well done, and every character has so much personality, that you stay curious about how the story will unfold.I personally still haven't finished the main storyline because I simply don't want it to end. I treat myself to a story mission every now and then, like a delicious slice of cake on the weekend. But while the story itself is quite serious, as gangsters usually are, the story does make plenty of room for a bit of humor, and especially nods to Hong Kong action movies. The combat is unique and fun, the world vibrant and interesting, the characters complex, the story great.Please play Sleeping Dogs, so you can start recommending it to your friends who will also wait months to actually do so, like you did.

												This game deserves a proper sequel, one of the most underrated games in my opinion.+ Great story with a lot of twists and turns that will keep you hooked to the end.+ Amazing fighting mechanics that feels very fluent, with plenty of combos to unlock.+ Beautiful recreation of Hong Kong.+ The city feels alive with plenty of pedestrians doing different things like working and holding conversations.+ Great side missions that also has some interesting storylines.+ Fun DLCs.+ Fun mini games and such to do on the side.+ great feeling of progression as you unlock better safehouses and cars and clothes with time.+ Great and memorable characters+ Nice voice actingThis game went through ""development hell"" as it was first being developed as ""True Crime: Hong Kong"" by Activision but was later sold to Square Enix, but even though it went trough some drastic changes I couldn't ask for more from any game. Sure it has flaws like any other game, and things they could have done better, but at the end of the day it is a fantastic game. ",1045,313,46,89,82,9,101

												You heard the story of Wei Shen! But now, hear it again, only it is prettier now! Like way prettier, also all the hair is all soft and moving and his jackets have little doodads and his clothes have physics that weren't there the first time! Also, now the DLC is all integrated into the game and the DLC missions show up at story-appropriate times, and DLC outfits and content is slowly distributed throughout the game in a way that is much more satisfying! No more will you turn on the game and get some weird pop-up about how now you can dress up like some old guy from MMA and also you have lots of money and points! Now you will have to quest to look like that old guy from MMA (I think, I don't really know who that guy is?).If you have seen the protests on television, then you will know the government doesn't want you to Occupy Central! Don't give in! With Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition, you can digitally Occupy Central and show your solidarity. Wei Shen supports freedom and self-determination, you should too!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've already played through this twice and hit almost 100% completion, and I still find myself coming back to this amazing game.Sleeping Dogs is a fun and action packed game with a brilliant story, and a great setting, although at some points it's mechanics let it down.Story:In Sleeping Dogs, you will control Wei Shen, an undercover cop tasked with infiltrating one of the Hong Kong triads and bringing it down from the inside. Wei himself is mostly a pretty forgettable character, and is not really shown to have many major flaws. He is tough and intelligent, and is essentially a perfect human, to a borderline unrealistic point. The story does not so much shine in all its characters as much as it does with its excellent moral conflict as Wei begins to be torn between whether or not he wishes to destroy the gang he works himself into, and in my opinion the story is one of the best aspects of Sleeping Dogs, and is a main reason I continue to return to the game. Setting:While the map may be a tad small compared to many open world games, the way the streets are constructed, the sound effects, and the whole atmosphere really creates a rich setting which at least to me, never gets boring. Hong Kong is essentially a necessary part of the game due to its focus on the triads, and even though it's quite small, what they do have is done just right. While I haven't personally been to HK, a friend of mine has said that it does in fact look like the real city.Graphics:Sleeping Dogs is a beautiful game, especially considering how it isn't exactly too new. Some of the textures aren't too great, and often the characters seem to shine like they'd been polished, but leaving the games apartment and walking out onto a street at dusk just after some rain still never ceases to amaze me.Music:The original soundtrack in Sleeping Dogs, for me, isn't really anything special. It certainly isn't bad, it just isn't really unique enough to stand out. The radio songs on the other hand, really hit the mark, particularly in my opinion on stations such as Softly or Warp Radio. I never get sick of just driving around the city listening to the music.Gameplay:While Sleeping Dogs on the surface may look a bit similar to GTA, it is in fact quite different, something which is both a positive and a negative. On the plus side, Sleeping Dogs' hand to hand combat is very well done. While it is spammy if you want it to be, the range of options you have at your disposal means that the combat doesn't get boring no matter how many fights you are in. A downside to this combat is the presence of firearms. Guns are not introduced until about 30% through the campaign, and even once introduced you would be hard pressed to obtain one outside of a campaign mission. There is not traditional weapon select as there is in many open world games, instead you are able to carry one small firearm stored in your pocket, but that firearm does not persist between missions meaning that if you had a pistol in your pocket and then do a mission, likely that pistol will have despawned again once you re-enter the open world. The general lack of guns in Sleeping Dogs is not necessarily a bad thing however, because the guns you can use are in all honestly not always that fun. They do not really feel as satisfying as guns in, say, GTA do, particularly due to the lack of variation. While slow motion cover vaulting or quick disarms are fun, the gunplay itself is often quite lacklustre in my opinion, meaning don't come to Sleeping Dogs looking for a great shooter.Perhaps my least favourite mechanic out of the whole game is it's driving. Cars in Sleeping Dogs handle terribly. Steering is not smooth, handbrakes are a joke, and the reversing camera is just plain bad. The redeeming feature of vehicles is the ability to jump from one to another. Despite how unrealistic doing this is, it is still satisfying to jump from one car to another in slow motion.Overall, Sleeping Dogs is perhaps one of my favourite games of all time. It has an excellently told story taking place in a rich and atmospheric world with great visuals. The melee combat is deep and satisfying, even though guns and driving fall off a little, making Sleeping Dogs essentially a must for any fans of a good tale.			",68,12,0,11,5,0,0

												When a game is remade and released, they usualy fall short of expectations and claims. This time, the game didn't.

												An honestly great game that is often overlooked by most gamers. An undercover cop brawler set in Hong Kong is an awesome concept and thankfully the game does delivers on that promise. The story is gripping as you get to know the local thugs and have conflicting feelings along the way. There are many twists and turns that keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. But if you are ever tired of main story, the side missions are very enjoyable as well.  The combat is okay, but makes up for it with exciting enviromental takedowns and a fun driving system. If you ever have one of those days where you are feeling down, this game will lighten up your day with its fun sandbox.			",238,18,2,23,5,1,10

Drivers don't get out from your way and neither pedestrians. But it looks really nice+/- A bit hard to maintain your cop score on the main missions, but the experience is easy to gain from side missions.A well done game. Definetly a 8.5-9/10. I can recommend it.			",124,7,4,13,8,0,12

												Forward note! For my opinion on the Sleeping Dogs in general, I assure you I'm a fan. I've bought the game triple times now, and my disregard about ""definitive edition"" concerning only how little I got, paying for the game that third time. You can see my review on the Sleeping dogs there: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/202170/In short, if you have the Sleeping dogs game already, you don't need to buy that ""Definitive edition"".  But if you've missed it earlier - don't wait until it's become completely obsolete, give it a shot!What is new in ""Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition""? Well, there are many small things redistributed here and there, mostly to the better. Example: there was a bind to the right mouse button, so if you click it while driving, Wei Shen jumps off the venicle with the gun ready, in slow-mo, of course. Cool feature, very cinematographic, but almost never used. I remember more than dozen times in the original Sleeping dogs when I occasionally clicking that button in the middle of the chase... and have to restart all sequence. Because of the one stupid button binding. Good news: they fixed it in ""Definitive edition""! Sweet? Yeah, for sure!But hey, key binding is a very small thing, do we really need to buy all the game once more to have normal controls?Sorry, if I'm talking too long, but I'm gonna give you a full comparison of the two products now, so if you're not ready to read it all, goto 10, or skip to the bottom.Like I said earlier, developers of Sleeping dogs redistributed all the secondary stuff in the game. That means that original game, all its mechanics, practically all its glitches - remained the same. Remember dying in the ""Election"" mission in jumping sequence? It's remained the same. Stupid taxi mappings? There. And so on. Yep, if we take a general look, they refurbished some textures. But that was made with great price of tossing away all 32-bit systems. ""VIP only"" now! But if you ask me, if the game looking better now, I'll answer ""No, it remained almost where it was. You'll not see the difference even if you try to"".All about secondary stuff, that's it. Notorious DLC. Now, in the Definitive edition, they seems much more logically connected with the main story. Side missions appears connected with the main quest progress, experience they giving now is not enough to quick levelling. All is much more fair now. And dull. And dumb. See, from the first place, the main story itself is not logical and well-implemented with the real (or cinematographic) Hong Kong. It is not a comic book, thank God, but very close to it - naive, sketchy and simplesized. Was made that way to fit ""normal"" user, of course.What I'm trying to say there is that all that developers gain in logic and balance, they lose in general fun out of the game. Take a Retro-Triad suit for example. In general sense, Wei Shen cannot wear a suit like that no matter what. It is not fit into story. Yet, it is fun to wear. So it exist. But there's a difference. In the ""old edition"" you can wear some (any) parts of that suit separately. I, for example, liked gloves. Someone liked the haircut (yeah, it's part of the suit). So everyone could pick it's own look. Sorry, but no more. If you want Retro-Triad suit, it's there, but only as whole. Makes even less sense than it was before.Let me put it once again:+ Added some high-res textures for graphics freaks. Still not comparable with the Rockstar product, though.+ All DLC, all the seconadary stuff now structurized and appears with the progress of the main quest.+ Some new missions were added! They are quite short and linear, but new is a new!+ Some small glitches and questionable game features was fixed- Owners of 32-bit windows systems now aren't supported. What is more, new graphics features requires a tricky manual tuning to work properly (at least, for PC with two graphics systems, like the most of gaming notebooks)- Implementation of the DLC made some of them very limited. You cannot divide costumes, you cannot beat monks in the temple multiple times, ""death by a thousand cuts"" mission now limited to 30 enemies and one go through (and what a good skirmish it was before! sob)- Some major game glithes and disadvantages remains (like the falling from the ramp in ""the Election"" mission or people stucking in walls)I'd praised all the fixes were they a simple update to the existing game. But paying once again for the very same story with the very same experience and bugs? That's rip-off!			",725,237,45,155,101,5,232

TL;DR:Spiritual successor to the ""TRUE CRIME"" open world games, Sleeping Dogs is such a HUGE step on improvements in every aspects of the past series. Solid story, great gameplay, decent visuals and voice acting! Highly recommended for every gamers who love open-world GTA style games!The definitive edition brings every released DLC on the vanilla edition into this edition. There is claims of improved visuals and other aspects but I cannot confirm nor deny these allegations as I barely played the ""normal"" edition.PROS:+Solid story+Great and savage melee combat+Fun driving and gunplay+Big variety in missions+Good visuals and voice acting.+Many collectibles to hunt down and other enjoyable diversions (if that is your sort of thing) but for once, these collectibles are actually handy. In exemple, I suggest you do all the races then some special three-way missions unlock so you can work upon getting the best ""experimental"" car in the game. VERY HANDY!+I played this game with keyboard and mouse and the controls were solid throughout the whole game. +Game supports 21:9 ultrawide resolutions and everything was perfect on it!+Sleeping Dogs ran without any problems, tech issues or game breaking bugs. There was a few instances that the game had frozen objectives and only way for fixing it was reloading the checkpoint. Aside from that, no issues whatsoever!CONS: -Wonky driving camera as it always auto-resets itself and there is no way to disable it. -There would also be some minor cons like the lack of plane/helicopter piloting since in SD, you only drive cars and boats.-Radio soundtrack is average, with a few good licenced songs on different radio stations. They can't beat GTA in that department.RECOMMENDATION:I wholeheartedly recommend this game to any fan of open-world type games similar to GTA. You will love this game!...CLOSUREA few months ago, it was confirmed that the Canadian developing studio behind Sleeping Dogs closed down. Such a big shame... Game of this quality deserved more sequels and I was very saddened to hear of that bad news. I'm not sure if the MMO-type Sleeping Dogs that was in production was one of the reason for the downfall since mostly every fans only wanted a true sequel instead but no one will know for sure.I really wish the best to the devs that worked at UNITED FRONT GAMES!

												Like GTA, but you're an undercover cop in Hong Kong investigating the Triads.  There isn't nearly as wide a variety of side activities as in GTA (ex. you won't be playing golf), but there are numerous side missions, races and cop jobs in addition to the 15-hour storyline.  The story and voice-acting are well done, though I did run into 2 or 3 audio bugs over the course of the game.  The camera feels a bit sluggish when using a gamepad, but for the most part the controls are solid.If you enjoy just racking up stars and avoiding arrests in GTA, or generally causing mayhem, this won't have the same appeal.  But if you like open world games with a focused narrative, this game kicks ♥♥♥.			",113,22,2,15,9,4,19

YEAH, VERY REALISTIC.In Sleeping Dogs, you can kill the entire people in the nightmarket. And ram police car into trash to avoid the arrest. This is called a one-man slaughter. THIS IS A CRIME-THEMED GAME !!!! In GTA5, you carry a load of firearms and draw from nowhere. YEAH, VERY REALISTIC.In Sleeping Dogs, weapons and firearms are not very necessary. Your body is the primary weapon against the thugs. The mixed martial arts used by Wei will make you feel breathtaking. Highly recommend this game if you're into crime-themed ones.			",57,6,0,5,3,0,1

												This and Far Cry 3 are probably the 2 games I enjoyed the most in the last 2 or 3 years.You get to play as Wei Shen, an undercover cop joining the Triads in Hong Kong, Armed with guns, swords, fish (yes fish), knives and some awesome martial arts skills you get to kick A** around Kong Kong.I wont get in to the background story as its available on the store page but i will say this is much more than a GTA clone, the gameplay, the story, and especially the location all give this game its own identity. I visit Far Eastern Asia twice a year and playing this made me want to go back sooner, it also reminded me of home a little with the once British influence of HK, especially the roads and transport.I didnt want this game to end and when it did I started it again.10/10 Hoping they make another			",221,26,41,3,10,1,11

												Just as good as the original Sleeping Dogs - so about 35-40 hours of quality open-world action. This version has slightly better graphics, some new minor missions and overall better balance (the game is a bit harder since you don't start with all the booster packs as was the case with the original release). I was happy to re-play this gem.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is absolutely brilliant. The gameplay - especially the fighting style is terrfic. The counter system is something unique. The story is great as well and the game offers a completely new experience. It's a game worth every single penny you pay. $30 for such a great game is very very very cheap. Before I bought the game, I read that the cutscenes were a bit laggy but there's no such thing here (maybe they fixed it or whatever).Scores a 9/10 for me (and my brother who persuaded me to buy it lol).

Hands Down , this game has THE most atmospheric CITY in any game i've ever played .  The city feels truly authentic . This is true HONG KONG . The shooting in this game is kinda clunky but who cares when you can go Bruce lee on everybody's asses . Guns are  for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  . The definitive edition comes with a huge graphical overhaul and all the DLC and its very Cheap ! My advice - Why are you still reading this ? just get it !			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a hongkonger myself, i can say that many of the aspects in this game are spot-on, e.g. the phone booths and some stickers on the walls etc. The cantonese is also perfect, which is rare in games. Only thing that annoys me is that the roads and the places are all in the wrong place, and the city doesnt look like Hong Kong in some places. Still a bloody nice game though.			",7,0,8,0,1,0,0

												Sleeping Dogs the Definitive Edition is a great rebranding of the original game. It updates the parkour and combat system with slightly new controls and in my opinion more response from the original. The driving has been improved by alot the only thing they didnt spiff up a bit was the camera controls while driving which can still be a pain in some situations. As for the textures and update models I will say the graphics haven't been updated that much but the increased models makes the enviroment feel a little bit more immersive. Now for the DLC which I feel is done the right way in this game as opposed to the original where it was all handed to you the second you step into your apartment and you become the endgame badass on mission 2. All the clothing has been added to a Legendary Vendor, police vehicles and equipment is achieved by finishing cop jobs, cars and other clothing is all unlocked via finishing missions/side content and the zodiac tournament. If you haven't yet played this game this is definetly a great buy having the whole game and DLC's in one with update mechanics and improved code for a much more stable playing experience. If you have the original game but not all the DLC's and you were a fan of this game you'll love it all over again. 9/10.			",243,24,7,26,22,4,40

Since the recent closure of United Front Games, I decided to make a review of what I consider their masterpiece, Sleeping Dogs.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sleeping Dogs, originally released in 2012 was a shock for me. I didn't like a single thing about True Crime (Sleeping Dogs originally was a True Crime sequel), and I was ignoring it from the announcement until the release. Then, days after release, I got a copy of the game for PS3, since I was curious to see the reason of all those great review scores that it was getting, and decided to try and I was impressed with everything. Hong Kong lives in the game, UFG really made a amazing recreation of it. The story was good, and even more if we take the open-world genre in account, it's not a mind blowing tale, but for it's genre, it's quite well built, graphics were very good, and so the soundtrack.After I finished it, I decided to wait for the DLCs to play it again but I ended just skipping it. However, sometime ago Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition was in a sale on Steam and I jumped for it, and honestly, I don't regret a single bit. Damn, I could have bought it for the full price and I still wouldn't regret.First, the PC port is good. We have some graphics options, like AA, shadows quality, motion blur, and full support to 60FPS/1080p+, and this is nice. Also, the Definitive Edition fortunately don't make you overpowered from the start (the original game had a lot of DLCs to get fast upgrades, cars, money and more), and this is great. Also, I played it for long sections without a single crash or breaking bug, another good point. The graphics are okay for today standards.Talking about the story again, it's not the greatest story ever told, but I enjoyed it. We're playing as the undercover cop Wei Shen, that came back from the USA to work in HKPD, his mission is to infiltrate and weaken one of the triads that run the town, called Sun on Yee (based off on the real HK triad, Sun Yee On). Before leaving Hong Kong for the first time, Wei had contacts within the triad, with made his job easier and as him complete jobs for his leader, Winston Chu, he turns in a very important member. After some events, himself turns in a SoY leader and begin to question his boss in the police. Overall, it's predictable (with the exceptions of some events that really took me in surprise), but it's good, well made, of course, it has some fails and holes, like for example, back in the start of the game, there's almost no guns at all. Then close to the ending, almost every mission will involve a gunfight. Also, some characters, like Sonny Wu, that ends doing a big part on the game, weren't developed at all. Maybe this could be explained with cut contents, I don't know. But still is a good story.Then, gameplay-wise, the fighting system is extremely good and satisfying. Wei can learn fighting movements with his old sensei, and also he can learn others when your triad level get higher. Exploring the city feels good, it's interesting search for collectibles and there's a lot of side missions, including races, hacking cameras, random events, favors and more. Driving cars is not that pleasant, but is acceptable, and cops porsuit is also good. The game has a good level of customization possibilities, from clothing to buying cars and items for your houses.And man, the soundtrack. UFG did a great work with it, there's a lot of radios, some with english pop, rock or eletronic, other with cantonese radios, with hip-hop and popular songs in the country, and also, there's a radio with classic music. And it's incredible how some songs are put in story missions, after one of the saddest missions on the game the wedding, this song just begun to play in the first car I got. Then, in a race in a place more distant from the city, this one started.After writing this, I just feel bad because I know that a sequel is unlikely now. And seeing the status of some franchises owned by Square Enix and their latest titles, like Just Cause and Deus Ex, it might be best to remain like this, but if someday Sleeping Dogs 2 comes, I will be there with my pork buns ready.REVIEW: 9.5/10			",490,120,17,36,41,6,58

												Play as an undercover cop in the Chinese triads working your way up in the Chinese criminal underworld.This is an unique game focusing on violent Kung Fu moves & melee combat.I would even go as far as to call this game more brutal than the GTA series, because of the sick Bruce Lee touch over this.Great soundtrack goes along with a great story and fun gameplay.I hope to see more Sleeping Dog games in the future.

												Bought this game accidentally after watching some sort of fighting compilation video, treated it as a cheap GTA clone, never expected much, but damn, this game delivers.Game incorporates some really fun gameplay mechanics, yes they are not new, borrowed from Max Payne (shooting) and Def Jam (fighting), all this blended with your typical open world features. While the game doesn't probably match the quality of Rockstar open world games, it really miles ahead of them when it comes to mechanics. To the key points then, good things:Immersive main story with variety of missions.Lot's of stuff to do: sidequests, jobs, street racing, drug busts, collectibles ect.As mentioned - really fun gameplay mechanics, slow-motion shooting and limb-breaking kung-fu delivers.Graphics and animations are pretty, very good motion capture, lots of advanced graphical options (AA, SSAO, HI-RES textures, shadow filtering, motion blur etc.).Burnout-style arcade driving with the ability to hijack cars on the go.Rather good depiction of Hong Kong with memorable characters and stylish music. Mr. Will Yun Lee did a terrific job as Wei Shen and most other characters deserve a praise as well.A lot of DLC which is smoothly incorporated in the main game (aside from 2 bigger DLC campaigns).Controversial:While the fighting system is good it really lacks depth. I understand that it was their first attempt with this game and they just tested whether people would like such fighting system or not in an open word game, but unfortunately it becomes stale rather fast, most likely due to quite underdeveloped skill tree which rarely adds new moves to your arsenal and sometimes just repeats itself, not to mention that some ""skills"" add only questionable passive bonuses.Social Hub is a fun feature where you can crack some records in variety of activities, but like almost every other leader board on Steam it's overrun by hackers with their impossible numbers. You still can use friend-filter and check out who did better among your FL.Story is pretty short, I guess if you rush it then you can complete it in under 10 hours...Bad things:Game is very easy, I ended up going for disarms 24/7 instead of vault-shooting most of the time just because you can survive a dozen of point blank shots from every weapon. It was basically the only way to occasionally die and make things harder for myself. Dying in melee is almost impossible though. Game could really benefit from multiple difficulty settings.Some technical difficulties, game freezing sometimes during launch screen and it changes resolution from time to time when you alt-tab out of it.SSAO cannot be turned off completely for some obscure reasons (not even via driver settings) so be prepared for an extra tax on your hardware.If you're a fan of GTA then you probably already played this, but if you're not (like myself) and hesitant then give this game a try, it has all sorts of stuff to keep you playing.EDIT: I even made my own video :>

												Sleeping Dog's is a GTA style action and adventure game set in open-world Hong-Kong, where you take the role of Wei Shen, an undercover cop that infiltrates one of the HK triads Sun On Yee. As game progresses, you gain both Police and Triad XP that provides different perks for each next level. Additionally, you gain face XP that provides additional bonuses and certain collectibles (jade statues) allow you to unlock melee combos in the local martial arts club. The game offers a wide range of various side missions (chase sequences, beat-em up missions, drug busts, dating missions, shooting missions, races) and mini games (♥♥♥♥ (rooster) fights, tournaments, karaoke). In overall, there's a heavy focus on driving and puzzle solving, as well, as hand-to-hand combat. Although, hand-to-hand combat is enjoyable, the driving and puzzle solving starts to get annoying and/or repetitive after a while. It seems, that the game was artificially made longer through driving, lock picking, camera hacking and collectible searching. However, the story is really strong and interesting and you grow attached to the main character and some of the NPCs. The graphics and voice acting are of high level and overall Sleeping Dogs is a fun, action-pumped open-world experience with a nice dose of Hong-Kong action flick influence. But, unfortunately, there are quite a few little faults that pull the game down and, as a result, it offers only a slightly above-the-average experience. Definitely enjoyable, but with more polish it could've been excellent.PROS:- Interesting main story missions- A vast variety of side missions- A skill tree- A vast variety of character skins and wide range of vehicle choices- Great combat mechanics- Good graphics (although the Definitive Edition is actually not that much of an improvement compared to the Standard Edition)- Open-world environment that is a simplified and not a very accurate replica of Hong Kong (who cares though?)- Emma Stone and Lucy Liu as voice actors ;)CONS:- Lack of convenient fast-travel options (only taxis that cost money and are not available everywhere and the car valet)- Dependence on foods and drinks that need constant replenishing for stat boosts- Annoying driving experience from time to time (narrow streets, intense traffic, AIs suddenly stopping in the middle of the road or changing lanes, camera spins on reverse, exaggerated momentum)- Sometimes it's hard to find the objective in the street mazes of Hong Kong- Inaccurate ranged weapons and barely noticeable cross-hairsMISCELLANEOUS- Romance is very superficial, it should have had more substance- Both the Definitive and Standard Edition didn't recognize my Nvidia videocard on Windows 8 and 8.1 and they crashed or freezed on the first loading screen. The forum solutions didn't work. I was able to play Sleeping Dogs only after the upgrade to Windows 10.My overall rating: 7.5/10DLCs:- Nightmare in North Point: imo, the best DLC of them all. A fun combat experience with elements of Chinese folklore. Adds some additional combat mechanics that allows you to fight demons and the blood-craving ghosts.- The Zodiac Tournament - also a fun story around a fighting tournament in the style of Enter the Dragon- Year of the Snake - a heavy focus on driving, repetitive side missions. The story is about Wei Shen investigating a terrorist cult. Quite boring.			",139,38,1,27,5,2,24

												I beat the original on PS3, I put 20 hours or so into the standard edition on PC, and now I've picked up the Definitive Edition on PC. So yeah, obviously, I really enjoy this game. I think it holds it's own against other sandbox games in its class; notably GTA and Saints Row. It's much more serious in tone though--it plays the whole ""good cop in too deep"" thing with a very straight face.So, the positives: Deep hand to hand combat mechanics Environmental kills look neat (putting someones face in a fan blade never gets old)Gunplay is funDriving is solidGreat voice acting and engaging story despite the genre tropesPolished visuals The world is well built, its very immersive, you feel like you're in Hong KongCons - there aren't manyCamera can get a little wonky in closed spaces, doesn't happen oftenSome of the side quests are a bit on the dry/tedious sideThings to be aware ofI've personally found that the definitive edition is a bit more demanding graphically than the regular edition, which makes sense being that they polished it up for the ""next gen"" (their words, not mine. The game looks good but it's far from being a ""next gen"" experience, imo). This will demand a bit more from your rig. I can NOT run this edition as high as I did the standard edition. So, if you were barely able to play the previous iteration just be aware that you may not have such luck with the definitive. Don't know if anyone else has experienced this or not, just giving you my own story.Anyway, enjoy.			",123,39,1,20,8,1,12

												So I downloaded the Definitive Edition of Sleeping Dogs on Steam. Gotta say I was pretty impressed with some parts in the game they really took extra care of. One thing I really like instead of boxes and crates just flying around all over now they will actually move and break apart. Your car driving stages are MUCH smoother this time around compared to before. (I sometimes hated the driving and shooting stages.) They fixed alot of other bugs including one that was very annoying. When walking up to certain food stations or NPC's sometimes Wei will walk in place and take like 2 or 3 minutes to finally get in the right position to finally speak to them That thankfully also has been fixed. If you were on the fence about getting Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition before try it out now. Lots of improvements plus if you originally had the game you can upgrade and pay $15 for the newer version. Overall? Solid game Can't wait to play through it again!			",319,39,10,29,10,2,4

												""You are a cop, I'm an undercover cop. The rules are different"" I think this famous line from the sleeping dogs marketing campaign sums it up well. The games protagonist Wei Shen is as he says in the quote. An undercover cop, infiltrating the notorious (fictional) Hong Kong Triad the ""Sun On Yee."" You get to play Wei as he goes deeper and deeper into the Triad lifestyle and organization too try and shut it down from the inside, while trying to keep his loyalties to the police in this sandbox game from Square Enix. The game isn’t perfect but it accomplishes what it wanted to do and is a welcome change of pace in the sandbox genre.The story begins with Wei Shen working for the police department when he is recruited by the police superintendent to go deep undercover into the Sun On Yee Triad due to his extensive skills and childhood relationships with current members. Wei takes the job on and then the real journey begins. Wei goes through a lot to prove his loyalties to Triad lieutenant Winston along with his childhood friend Jackie. Wei finds that a rival lieutenant is at odds with Winston and it quickly leads to a gang war. Wei has to take extreme actions to prove he is loyal to his Triad which starts to put him at odds with the police. The hole gets deeper and deeper for Wei in a compelling story that’s well written and well-acted.The gameplay is pretty standard sandbox fair. It plays pretty much exactly like GTA which it takes obvious inspiration from in almost all aspects of the game. The key difference between the two is the emphasis on melee combat; guns are much more rare in Hong Kong than they are in American based sandbox games. So naturally the melee combat is much more refined than it is in other sandbox games. The melee combat plays almost identical to the ""Batman Arkham"" series, though not quite as smoothly but it works fine. Beating down gangsters in Bruce Lee style martial arts fighting never gets old thankfully and is lots of fun. It is however, naturally much more grounded than Batman, so don’t expect to go all flying fists everywhere during a fight. It actually works very well having the game's combat so focused on melee. It changes things up and provides greater difficulty than having all the games fights be settled with guns. Now that doesn’t mean that there aren't gun fights in this game because there sure are, lots of them and they have a John Woo film/Max Payne bullet time feature which is tons of fun. Particularly in the games third act. The guns fights really aren’t very hard, about as difficult as a GTA game and play identically to GTA IV and V. Driving naturally is also something that you will do A LOT. It's just the part of the nature of sandbox games as GTA and Saints Row players will know and expect. The game has plenty of cars and motorcycles and other types of vehicles to get around in. Another welcome addition that sleeping dogs brings to the table is an easy, functional and basic parkour system. The games parkour is mostly just for making moving around the city easy, fast and fun. You won’t be climbing buildings ""Assassins Creed"" style but it works well and makes movement lots of fun. Car combat is prevalent as well. The game allows you to shoot while driving with 360 degree aiming in a well-designed easy to use system. It makes crazy hi-octane car battles some of the highlights of Sleeping Dogs. The game's story mission and side mission structure works identically to GTA. There’s the main story missions marked with green icons on your map. Side missions are marked with variously coloured icons for different things such as: police missions, favours for citizens of Hong Kong etc. Story missions feature a clever mechanic where you are graded on your performance as a Triad gangster and a cop based on your actions during a mission. Killing your enemies in effective and brutal ways will get you more points with your Triad score while minimizing damage to the public will get you points for your cop score. It really makes missions more interesting and gives good incentive to be precise and careful during missions. There are quite a lot of side missions to do as well but unfortunately this is where one of the games main flaws resides. Many of the less significant side missions are recycled and repetitive which can be boring and even some what frustrating. It terms of the main story it’s also on the shorter side at thirty missions. It is an exciting, intense and well done story however so it's easy to forgive its shorter length. The best side missions are for sure the police cases. These have you looking into serious crimes for the police while working outside the system. You investigate kidnapping of illegal immigrants, serial killers, organ harvesters, the black market and hard core drug dealing. These all tell small stories on the side that are satisfying to play and solve. Street racing with various ""classes"" of vehicles ranging from class A-C is common and lots of fun, especially with the class A vehicles. It helps that the driving is pretty well done in the game. Now aside from the main story and side missions there are other things you can do with your time as well. Karaoke is very popular in Hong Kong and when you go to clubs there are rooms where you can take part in a guitar hero style mini game of karaoke played with your keyboard or your controller. There aren't many songs to play but they are fun. You can also go hunting the collectables, which thankfully are all helpful and actually do something. There are three kinds of collectables in the game: health shrines, jade statues and lockboxes. There are fifty health shrines in total and like the name suggests finding them will increase your max health. There are like one hundred lockboxes that are full of money and unlock more clothing options. The best collectables though are for sure the twelve jade statues, finding them allow you to unlock new moves to use in melee combat. These moves are taught to you by Wei's wise childhood sensei; every time you bring him one he has a heart to heart with Wei about his life choices and his past. They also discuss his life as a Triad but he cannot reveal his true nature as an undercover cop and it’s surprisingly insightful. The characters are very important of course, Sleeping Dogs has a big cast of characters who are all well written and very well acted. Besides Wei there's his best friend and Triad member Jackie, his Triad boss Winston, Police Superintendent Pendrew and many others. One thing that Sleeping Dogs brings back from GTA San Andreas is Wei having relationships with various women over the course of the story. However this is a big screw up in how Sleeping Dogs executes these relationships. Basically it works like this. You meet a woman and help her out, and then she gives Wei her number. You go on one date with her and then at the end of the date you have sex which you see or hear none of (this sex comes way too easy by the way) and then you unlock some bonus after. The bonuses are actually really helpful so even though these relationships are so poorly done they are still totally worth doing. Another issue with the game is the celebrity voices. No the celebrities don’t do bad jobs in their roles, in fact they do well. However they are super underutilized, Tom Wilkinson plays the police superintendent and even though it sounds super important he isn’t in the game nearly as much as you would expect. Lucy Lui and Emma Stone are barley even in the game at all. A total waste of money and talent. All in all Sleeping Dogs is a fun sandbox game. It has some notable flaws that hold it back from being in the same league as its competition and inspiration. It brings some welcome things to the sandbox game table with its parkour and emphasis on melee combat as well its clever cop/criminal dynamic with the protagonist. I can easily recommend this game when it’s on sale.  7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is often referred to as the Chinese/Japanese GTA. I hope that we can put this common misconception aside and look at this game as it is. The game brings so much more to the table. It has a hacking system, good melee combat , free running, mahjong poker, classical music & chinese pop on the radio and even karaoke. That's not the surprising part, the surprising part to me was that it brought as much as GTA IV and combine it with so much more side stuff. To give you an idea how much there is, there is about 30% story and the rest of it is all side stuff. And when you are thinking that you are done with everything you can call contacts to unlock even more side content, at the moment 32 hours in, I did just about did half of the whole package.The fighting system is both smooth on keyboard and mouse as it is on controller. The main fighting style in the city is kung fu, and anyone seems to master it, and the game loves to shed light upon this style to make players use it . What I mean with that is that gun fights are going to be there but they are going to be scarce. There are loads of combinations to unlock in fighting to make you even more of a powerhouse. They even added realistic sounds to the fighting, whenever we are doing a finisher which is breaking an arm for example sounded so realistic that it reminded me from when I dislocated my shoulder. It sounded so similar that I got goose bumps from it. Some kinds of fighters grab you from behind and hold you in a uncomfortable position to escape from but it is so hard to escape from that it's annoying. Another minor disadvantage is that the heavy and weak attack is set to the same key which I thought made the combinations a bit harder than they should be.The story starts off pretty straight forward and linear but eventually I got attached to the main character as you get to understand him. You play Wei Shen, a returning Hong Kong citizen, which had connections with the Sun On Yee triads from his childhood. Upon his return he got arrested because of crimes he commited in the United States. Since he has connections to the triads he has to infiltrate into the gang and destroy the gang from inside out. This includes betrayal, killing, investigations on people and even hacking to achieve your goal. Most of the side mission also are about the police work you can do. The main character really was well fit into the story, most of the time you could not even tell if he was instinctivily making decisions in the gang or he was doing it to succeed in his mission to destroy the gang. In the end the story takes a few interesting turns which came out of nowhere but it turned out very good. In the past you could buy the version without the DLC's but I looked into it and they seemed mandatory since that version is not available anymore. There are two extra stories, obviously smaller than the main story.The first DLC is called Nightmare in North Point which is set after the main story as a horror story. It includes ancient Chinese myths like the Jiang Shi folklore. The combat is also pretty engaging because every fight gets more intense with an extra difficulty added. For me this DLC is equally good content as the main story.The second DLC is called Year of the Snake which is set right before Chinese New Year. Here you have to do cop work to defeat a terrorist cult trying to bomb the city and most of it's citizens. It was more of a cat and mouse game than the suposed investigation on the cult. Some of the missions initiated with searching within an area which was just as easy as finding the odd looking guys in special suits. I wish they had made that more intense. What I also noticed is that unlike in the main story of the first DLC is that Wei was very quiet which I did not like, I would have loved some conversations even if it just was filler.All in all a real thrill to play and even worth trying out if you favor GTA above anything. If the fighting style sounds like you would enjoy it or enjoy the combination they pulled off with the police work and the triad crimes you really should try out this game. However you shouldn't pick this up if you do not prefer melee combat.			",34,6,0,9,8,0,6

												GTA but with pork buns how could you not want it?Really though it was an enjoyable game, the story isn't necessarily amazing but it's definitely enough to keep you playing. Of course like other 3rd person console ports there are some issues with controls (and disgusting aim assist) and the driving felt very weird to me like you were driving through molasses or something but even with that the game was still fun to play through. I didn't do all the side quests but I did most of them (and played pretty slowly) and racked up 25 hours so for the current price I'd say it's a definite pickup. That being said it's, in my opinion, not worth the $30 price tag that it has normally, it's a fun game but it's not $30 fun. 7/10 get some pork buns			",117,11,0,5,5,1,0

												This game is amazing,ok it's also not perfect even in its ""definitive edition""but the Hong Kong setting, very different to what I'm used to, undercover cop... very interesting game imho. Also a good GTA-like albeit with a bit more fighting.The good:-good gfx-good music-awesome setting-Lucy Liu voiced Vivienne !The minor flaws : -some binds are not rebindable, even though you can rebind most of them too badexamples : map hotkey, phone hotkeys-can't call anyone in the middle of missions, sometimes forcing you to steal a car or walk a lot-the car controls are good overall, very easy to do 180° turns & the like, that said they lack in precision, it's somewhat not easy to navigate in between cars without hitting any, particularly with fast cars. It's not undoable, it's just the car tend to jump left & right instead of smoothly turn.-when people are in your car, or even alone, sometimes it's good to drive ""slowly"" if you wanna hear all the conversations, I know I made the mistake a few times and the game just skip ahead if you went too fast, therefore you might miss out on stuff. (albeit it's minor)-I know guns are a rarity in hong kong, but you can lose your gun while eating pork bun .....it just vanishes ....also in the same vein, some guns are in locked boxes, had an Uzi ? well there was a gun in the box, Uzi vanished ...If you read all that you must think : ""what the hell so many flaws ?"" well it's all pretty minor, too bad this wasn't polished a little more, but the game is worth going through these little annoyances.

												Wow, I can't thank the developers of this game enough for an amazing job they have done to create a game that looks amazing and can be played flawlessly. The game has such fluid motion even in full throttle action racing through the streets and the gameplay from start to finish is very personal and inviting. From a PC Enthusiast I recommend this game over Watch Dogs and all the GTA's. I put this in the same category of joy to play a PC game as playing Tomb Raider, Kingdoms of Amular, Skyrim, Witcher 2, Batman Arkham City, Darksiders and Prince of Persia Forgotten Sands of Time. I'm not saying it is better or worse than these games but I thoroughly enjoyed these games and it's so hard to find a new game with these next generation high definition graphics that can play well, well this one plays amazingly. Thank you for updating this game and  getting it to play so well. I must admit to all gamers out there this game uses 95% on GPU1 and 97% on GPU2 of my GTX 690 and averages 55-60FPS at 1080P, reduces to 45FPS sometimes but I don't notice unless I watch the FPS counter. so it isn't going to play 60FPS for your everyday card but I do have the game on the most extreme settings.I7 2600 @ 4.2Ghz Alphacool Watercooling System16GB G Skill Ram - 6GB used for XFAST RAMGTX 690 Alphacooled Watercooling SystemASROCK Z77 Extreme 4 MotherboardWindows 7I hope this review was helpful to you and you enjoy the game as much as I am, worth every cent.

												Is this a copycat GTA game? Sure! A lot of stuff in this game is almost a direct copy of GTA game mechanics. Does that make the game worse than GTA? No not at all!  Even though they have blatantly copied a lot of (the good) stuff from GTA they have added enough destinctive differences to make it a different game with it's own attitude and atmosphere. You do notice that this game has been made with a smaller budget than GTA series. Controls are a bit rough at times specially with vehicles, fighting the camera at some places, lesser quality physics and a bit less detailed map. However, the gameplay is more fun than in GTA (imo). Unlike in GTA your character in Sleeping Dogs can fight and learn fighting techniques. Specially later on in the game after your character is a skilled fighter you can have some great looking (kung fu) combat moves against opponents and have challenging battles on your hand.As for the story and all the story missions you can expect the same'ísh as in GTA, same thing more or less, but then in Asian style. It does have more interesting game mechanics that GTA does not have, such remote manual unlocking/hacking with your phone.And as for the map, it is a bit more oldschool made than GTA 4 and 5, specially the terrain,vegetation and rocks. When you look at the buildings and the terrain you can see they didn't had the budget to compete with GTA quality, however it still looks great and immersive on maxed settings!For some reason this game never became quite AAA popular, even at release (if I remember right) it wasn't that hyped at all. Strange, because this game is so worth a playthrough (and a 2nd)! 85/100			",148,11,15,23,22,1,29

												A beautiful remake of Sleeping Dogs, Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition brings many improvements, such as an increased population to the city (Hong Kong isn't a ghost town, after all), far better reflections, an everpresent and atmospheric fog, and much better textures. This of course causes much greater load on your machine, so be sure you've got enough juice. On my 7970s, it can get quite framey when deep in the city with large crowds. Otherwise, it runs at a buttery-smooth 60FPS.While some may dismiss this as a quick cash-grab, if you haven't had a chance to play Sleeping Dogs, now's your chance, and if you have, you'll enjoy the graphical improvements.

												I just finished beating the main story and the expansion""Year of the Snake.""  This is a great game with an exciting combat system.  This game plays like a modern day kung fu movie.  Where it is honestly hard to tell which side of the law your character will prefer.  Will he choose to rat out his childhood friends and assist the police, or fight for the Sun on Yee Triad?  The plot twists and turns until the very end.  During game play you will learn several different martial arts attacks and pick up some ancient chinese wisdom along the way.  Courtesy of your neighborhood kung fu master.  I really enjoy the added features of the definitive edition.  Especially the added character skins or outfits.  Like the all to important SWAT uniform, which is great for brawls.  Leveling up is fast and it is possible to level up in several different manners.  With the most important being your Triad and Police scores given after the completion of each mission.  The only downside is there are a few glitches leftover from the earlier version on console.  Your phone might glitch so you can't put it away or your cars might disappear from the garage during the Amanda side missions.  There is no way to get them back.All in all a great game.  I would recommend this game to anyone who has ever watched a martial arts movie.   ",15,0,0,0,4,1,2

												So is the definitive edition of Sleeping Dogs worth it if you have already played Sleeping Dogs on pc. Well from the get go you will notice the little details like Facial features.car textures,colors & the streets of hong kong are more populated with people I have never seen before & I have seen a lot in the original Sleeping Dogs in my 59 hours of playing it .The lighting has also been imporved as well to give it that more realistic feel. There is also a legendary clothing shop which makes all the dlc clothing available for purchase & not just in your wardrobe which makes the process of going out collecting the red envlopes & opening lockboxes more enjoyable when you actually have to spend the time to work towards buying all your outfits instead of having a large sum of money towards the end game.There are also some new cop missions as well from taking out gangs members to stopping a street race by taking out All the street racers before the race finishes.Add that in with the bonus of getting all the dlc & you have yourself one of the best looking games on pc for a reasonable price. For those that haven't played Sleeping Dogs yet what are you waiting for go & experience Wei Shen's Amazing story now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I spent over 100 hours on the original Sleeping Dogs several years ago on my old PC; on my new, much more powerful machine, I was thrilled to play the definitive edition. It's not merely a re-release - it's a reworking of the graphics and an improvement on the already fun, fluid combat and driving mechanics, and it contains additions to the campaign (extended narrative, extra side missions) that are worthy of the repurchase cost for fans who already have the original (specifically those who liked it and want to play it again). Because I had already finished the campaign as well as the DLC episodes, I was hesitant to buy the same game twice, but when it went on sale for $7.50, I struck and was very happy I did. This is not only an extended and much more immersive experience; it works better on newer software and hardware architecture. It manages to pack Hong Kong more densely with NPCs and greatly improve environmental textures and weather while demanding much less of my GPU than the original release. They both hit some of the same framerates, but with settings cranked, my video card runs much harder & hotter in the original release while it's capable of rendering much more with less power in the definitive edition. Truly an optimal redesign for the PC.For the many who've already played Sleeping Dogs and loved it, I recommend picking up the definitive edition IF you want to play through the campaign again or if you haven't played the DLC episodes (and I'd wait for a sale). You may find the experience enjoyable as I did or you may feel like you're wading through the same water (albeit much more detailed, highly rendered water). If you've never played this modern classic, this is the edition to get - it's a very fun open world action/adventure game in the vein of Grand Theft Auto with tons of collectibles, a martial arts beat 'em up combat system, great driving mechanics, fun missions and side-objectives, and, most importantly of all, a captivating story fronted by a compelling protagonist who leads a double life as both an undercover cop & triad member and a Chinese-American immigrant & Chinese national. As another Asian-American who's faced confusion stemming from a bi-cultural background, I find Wei Shen to be a well written, sympathetic and multi-faceted hero/anti-hero. In addition, the ties the game shares with HK Crime and Kung Fu films (references, atmosphere, setting, style) alone are enough to draw me in to its highly detailed vision of modern Hong Kong and keep me playing in it time and time again.

 I give Sleeping Dogs: 8/10  SPOILER FREE! Sleeping Dogs is a really immersive game, not in terms of graphics but in terms of gameplay. We follow our main protagonist who is a cop, back in his hometown of Hong Kong where he grew up. Only this time, he's going undercover to stop big crime organisations such as the Sun On Yee (Sun Yee On in real life, yes they were real gangs). The game itself had some of the most fun gameplay features I've ever seen. The gameplay felt like I was really a part of Hong Kong. Pros  The best feature about this game is the combat. The combat gameplay in this game is really mind-blowing because of how balanced it is. At times, it doesn't feel too easy but it isn't too hard either. I really liked how you can unlock new moves, and how the game focused more on brawling than gun gameplay. The graphics in this game are really good, especially on the interior houses that you own. The character models could be improved a bit, so can the whole depth of field and atmosphere, but the world detail was really outstanding and I really liked it. The character development in this game was really done well. You built relationships with the people around you, both cop and gang sides. The sound is the game is really good too. It builds you into the environment like as if you are really there. Performance wasn't an issue, the game ran really smooth on high. Cons  the worst thing about sleeping dogs in my opinion was the driving. The driving felt really stiff and at times, racing was a lot harder because of this. Yes there was handbrakes and braking, but the driving just didn't really make me like how it was controlled. Lack of vehicle catergories. There was hardly any wide ranges of cars/bikes, and besides that, there is only on land and on sea vehicles. That showed the game with less variety. The map is really short and inconvinient. Sometimes, the map felt really short and didn't make Hong Kong seem big at all. It would have been better if the map was a lot bigger.I hope you have enjoyed my review of Sleeping Dogs. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a Fast and Furious like game, (or even a Kung Fu movie).

												Note: This review is about the changes in ""Definitive Edition"", not about the game itself. So what is the difference between the original version and definitive edition? Not much, it's just patched original Sleeping Dogs with full DLC and some improvements to the graphic that are either insignificant or unimportant. I can play the original version at max setting with solid fps, but I have to play this one on medium because the fps are too unstable (FYI, my spec is more or less the same as recommended), I also have a problem with ingame screen resolution, it causes me to have some kind of slightly visible letterbox appears at times, which is annoying because original version didn't have it. But as I said, the changes to graphic are insignificant. World density is the only improvement that worth mentioning, which makes the world more living by adding more cars, people on streets, NPC variations (less clones),... but this change can be achieved by a free patch, not a patch being sold. Also, still no Steam Cloud, wtf dev? Seriously? In short, Sleeping Dogs is an amazing game, but this Definitive Edition is a quick cash grab, patched games being sold at high price. Don't buy it if you already owned the original version, it's not worth it.For people with spec below recommended: Don't buy it because the spec given by the dev is inaccurate, you can play it on low smoothly, but it will look worse and less stable than the original version on medium. It seems the game doesn't use up all the CPU power, but depends mostly on GPU power, which means you need a strong GPU to play this game on high smoothly.			",175,29,1,29,9,0,6

												Amazing storyline, diverse characters that are all unique and with great dialogue and voice acting, fun events, side missions, and DLC. You can really relate to the protagonist, Wei Shen, and the other main characters you meet throughout the story. Sleeping Dogs will always be one of my most favourite games. I can't remember how many times I've played through it on console or PC. The campaign is amazing, unfortunately it immerses you so much that you end up completing it before you know it, leaving you feeling empty and defeated. Then you just start from the begining again and the cycle continues :)Honestly, the greatest, most underrated open world game of the decade.Overall, if you haven't played Sleeping Dogs before, then I highly recommend that you do. It's one of those games you simply must experience.			",110,19,0,11,9,0,5

												Sleeping Dogs features Wei Shen, an undercover cop struggling to balance his Triad loyalty and police responsibilities on the streets of Hong Kong.The game features a well-crafted martial arts combat system, blending combos, counters, light and heavy attacks, and grabs/throws to create freeform fights that emphasize flow and diversity over efficiency. Environmental attacks and upgradeable special moves round out the variety.The real selling point is the map design - Hong Kong is lovingly rendered with beautiful levels of detail, from crowded market streets to curved highways overlooking endless rows of shipping docks. It's a delight to simply drive along the coastal highways and listen to the rippling shoreline or zip around the market districts. It's downright breathtaking, and stands head and shoulders above GTA's cities in terms of sheer visual interest.The story is solid, albeit a bit standard. Gunplay, driving, and some side activities like gambling or drug busts provide a solid variety of activities for the entire map. Music, sound and voice acting are top-notch.This is a a polished and cinematic take on the GTA sandbox formula, I thoroughly recommend it.			",214,23,0,22,10,2,9

A review for Sleeping Dogs : Definitive EditionIn this review, most of the review will review the gameplay of the game, as I seen that the meat of the game should also be in its gameplay. While some game will require great interfaces, games that are focused on open-world fighting/shooting should be focused on its gameplay.The first thing about this game, is that it has excellent gameplay, and quite varied with the well-established free-roaming games such as Grand Theft Auto series, Saints Row series, or Just Cause series. While four of them are great, the thing that makes Sleeping Dogs great is it have small amount of guns. It means that guns are hard to come by, most enemies don't have guns, and for the most part of the game you won't be using a gun.You won't be using your gun, but you are using your fist and your martial skill, this is what makes the game interesting. As with other fighting games, you can chain combo, do heavy strikes, block and counter, and other typical fighting moves. As you collect collectibles in the game, you will gain more advanced martial arts strikes, thus making you are more potent combatant. For most of the game you will face off with your enemy with Triad enemies with your fist, so fighting in the game have more color than its FPS aspect. In the fighting, you and your enemies will use believable melee weapons such as knife, tire iron, batons, meat cleaver, and not using melee weapons that are scarcely available in modern settings such as spears, katanas, or swords. This makes the fighting more realistic.The great aspect in the fighting is the environmental kills. These type of kills are brutal, that's for sure. You could stick someone's head in rotating fans, throw somebody to a flaming furnace, electrocute them with high voltage, throw them to the garbage bin, puncture their lungs using ""sharp objects"", drown them in water, and many more. In the shooting aspect, this game is also good. Not great, but good. The type of weapon did not vary very much, because then, as the story will tells you : ""Guns are rare in Hong Kong."" The game features a ""shoot from cover"" system and ""blind fire"" system, closely looks like GTA IV system, but there are some perks in shooting aspect, like you can enter slow mo mode if you leap from one place to other place. There is nothing new in shooting aspect, but it's good enough, in my opinion it's better than GTA IV system.In the gameplay, it's interesting also to note that your character is not Thor or something. The character will die quickly if shot at, making we more careful if we exchange fire with firearm-wielding enemies. While the character could take more damage in melee fighting, it's interesting to see that our character could not take much hit from firearms. It's quite real obviously, you could take three to four punches without dying, but two shots could kill you. This, and coupled with lack of firearms (and its ammunition) makes the police/law in the game very strong, because you could not bring your fist to a firefight.The ambience of Hong Kong is very greatly potrayed. I have been to Hong Kong for numerous times, and I would like to say that the spirit of Hong Kong is captured well. The signboards really reflects Hong Kong, as does how Hong Kong shop owners shout to the customers to ask them to purchase some DVDs, or how great their pork bun is. The street is also filled with Hong Kong cars, most notably the red taxi, the green small bus, the blue truck/construction worker transport, and many others. The street signs also are done in Chinese, so that the environment is greatly looking as the real Hong Kong. The only thing that I complains is there are lack of Chinese language use, because though Hong Kong people do understand English, in most times they are using Chinese, not English. While some ""curses"" in the game are obviously Chinese, I would like if the game respect Chinese language more.The activity of this game is somewhat bland. You have the regular racing (while you have to be #1, which is another thing I complain). You have fight clubs, where you will fight people. The only activity that interests me is the ""drug raid"" system, which are akin to GTA San Andreas hood takeover system. You fight some people, and you call something on TV, jobs done. There are lockboxes, shrines, and others as collectibles, but I don't see collecting collectibles as activities. For instance, there are no restaurants, no strip clubs, no bars, that you could interact. Story wise, this game have excellent story. I would not spoil it, but somewhat the ending is ""expected"". The twist of the game is ""expected"" too. If you have watched the movie about undercover agents you would know who will betray you. But, all in all, an excellent story.The ""other"" games that are provided in the Definitive Edition (the zombie, the police pack, etc.) are not going to be reviewed much, because they are not the meat of the game. While they are interesting, I would say that the DLCs are pretty bland. Purchase this game, and purchase that pork bun, because a man without a pork bun in their hand is not a real man.

												Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is quite the thrill ride! It takes place in Hong Kong, and you take on the role of an undercover cop, Wei Shen. It is tasked to you to infiltrate the Triad gang known as the Sun On Yee (新安義), and become one of their own. Wei Shen starts his way into the gang by means of his childhood friend Jackie Ma, slowly gaining trust and respect along the way.The game is played in third-person, from behind the main character, though you have free camera movement to look from the front, sides, up, down, etc. There are various play styles along the way, from casual walking and running, to driving cars or motorcycles, to combat moments, parkour chases, driving gunfights, and so on...The visuals of the game are gorgeous, the city is bright and beautiful, especially when the lights all come on at night. When it rains, which usually is a pretty torrential downpour, is always visually beautiful, everything is wet and shiny. The surface of a simple puddle on the ground reflecting the world around it, it's absolutely stunning. When driving fast in a car or on a bike, the way the world streaks and blurs away in motion is great.There are clothes shops throughout the city that you can purchase different elements of clothing from shirts, vests, jackets, coats, pants, shorts, shoes, glasses, hats, chains, watches, bracelets, etc. There are also vehicle stores for purchasing cars and motorcycles throughout the city as well. Some clothing and vehicles are unlocked automatically through game progression, but most you will purchase as you make money on jobs and favours (and running over parking meters on the sides of the street with your car, haha).Many missions are presented to you throughout the game, some are through regular game progression, some you have to find, including small favours from shop owners, random people you meet on the street, fellow gang members, etc. These are optional, but I find that they are often very much worth doing, as you gain money and respect / influence.Gameplay is fluid, very smooth and natural, running, walking, driving... the parkour requires you to be smooth, you need to time your jumping over objects just right, or else you end up clumsily hopping over something and slowing down, trying to catch your bearings. The combat is sometimes difficult, and not so smooth. You will often have someone attacking you while you are dealing with one guy, and you need to counter their attack. Counters, grapples, and environmental kills are often fun, but have to be done just right (but those can often be quite brutal, yet satisfying).With the Definitive Edition of the game, you get all the DLC packs that were originally purchased separately from the main game, the key ones being Nightmare at North Point and Year of the Snake stories, which I would recommend doing after you have completed the main story. Year of the Snake pretty much takes you to right after the main game is finished, you're a beat cop investigating a cultist group planting bombs all over the city during the Chinese New Year. Nightmare at North Point takes you into only one area of the city, North Point (obviously) is only one of four areas you will see on your map. It is in this area that supernatural occurrences start taking place, as the undead start to rise by way of their leader Smiley Cat. But you gain some new supernatural abilities as well to deal with them.Overall, I had an awesome time playing this game. Put in about 70 hours at the time of this review. Main story and the DLCs, completed all missions and favours, and have 100% achievements. It was, as I said, quite a thrill ride, and I loved it. Highly recommended 9.5/10			",520,174,17,100,73,14,90

												I love this game!Major overhaul on the graphics: really makes Hong Kong feel alive, also it awesome that they included all the DLCs with the game. Solid gameplay, does get repetitive after a while if you don't progress through the story. Speaking of Sleeping Dogs story line, its a nice change when compared to all the new indie survival/voxel/horror/crafting/multiplayer-only/rpg/storyline-less games. I picked it up when it came out for 15$ and recommend, if you're interested, you buy it now during the autumn sale or the winter sale(might be cheaper).For those like myself that already own the original version I still recommend getting it. I didn't realize I'd have so much fun in a second play through. TL;DR Buy it			",432,40,14,34,35,0,42

												I've played the original Sleeping Dogs and it was a pretty great game. This version is no different, however, it has improvements that make me recommend it over the original. The performance is solid, the controls are more natural for PC players, and really looks better in general. There's things like HDAO that make cutscenes look great, improved models, city density, better lighting and reflections, and of course, everyone's favorite, lens flare. I'd say it's a great game to get into if you haven't played it before. If you have, it's definately worth playing through again with all the pretty graphics and blinky lights. All the DLC is included as well so there is a lot available from the get-go. Visit the trading forum to get this game really cheap!I don't support this type of behavior from developers, but I liked the original and got it for free with my graphics card. I've always wanted to play the DLC missions as well, so this was an instant buy for me. Adding the solid 60fps that I didn't get from the original, I'd have to recommend it.Also, having FRAPS open disables the overlay.I'd give this a 9/10.			",439,103,12,38,31,2,41

												A great open world game with a lot to do, excellent cast and plot, fun fluid martial arts combat and some good action-movie styled gunplay/shootouts. The sidemissions in the game are generally fun, although the drug busts can get repetitive. Decent character customization, but some bad animation besides in the cutscenes (which were done with motion capture I imagine) and the martial arts combat, which felt very fluid.Gunplay was alright, it wasn't the highlight of the game but it was still very fun, and the slow-motion while vaulting and shooting was very satisfying. The graphics are good, the model detail was good for the most part, although the detail on the civilians was pretty bad for the most part, as to be expected with an open world game.Overall, this game is a fun open-world interpretation of Hong-Kong. In my opinion it's worth more than the 30$ it's selling at right now. If I was to rate it, I'd give it an 8/10. Favorite Square-Enix game in my opinion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

-Quick Review-Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is an Open World, with Third-Person Shooter and Martial Arts combat themes. There are many side tasks and side missions for you to run; races, fight clubs, gambling, police missions, and much more. -Detailed breakdown review-Story: You play as Wei Shen, an undercover cop attempting to infiltrate a Hong Kong criminal organization known as the ""Sun On Yee"". Will Wei Shen keep his loyalties to the cops? will he become unstable from the stress? Will he be swayed to only work for the Sun On Yee and forsake his allegiances? You'll need to play to find out. (I'll tell you this much: I had no idea which direction we were going in this game.)

Gameplay: (There's a lot to say about the Gameplay in Sleeping dogs, so I'm going to add more sub-topics. Hopefully that makes the information easier to read.)-CombatMartial ArtsThere are two types of combat in Sleeping Dogs; Martial Arts and eventually (when you get a gun) the shooting combat is played in third person. The Martial Arts section has different combinations of attacks; for example, click click click-and-hold, click click click click click-and-hold. However for most of the combo's you'll need to unlock by returning statues (hold that thought, we'll come back to that later).So you've got your clicky basic attacks, but wait! There's more! There is also grappling. By grappling you grab a hold of your enemy for a short time, you can proceed to beat your enemy like a drum with standard clicks... or you can embrace your inner monster and smash your new dance partner into an environmental object. You can do a special environmental kills with various objects which are outlined in red while grappling. (remember to make your choice fast, or else your dance partner will escape!)Arguably the most important features of the hand-to-hand combat is counter attacking, before most attacks the attacking NPC will suddenly have a red outline, at this time if you press the counter button (""E"" on the default keyboard controls) Wei will execute various counter attacks, counters are extremely important, many tough enemies are nearly impossible to defeat without them.I would quickly like to make a few aesthetic mentions: the Martial Arts moves are spot on. I've been practicing TaeKwonDo for a few years, and watching those backspin kicks... oh! it's beautiful! Additionally the animation styles are very varied; so you don't keep seeing the same slow motion kills again and again, even after 30 hours spent in the game it's extremely satisfying to punch out someone, or if I get tired of that I could just put 'em in a dumpster.


Hello Face, I would like to introduce you to Mr.Table Saw

Third Person ShooterEventually Wei gets his hands on some weapons; there are plenty of them. The first few weapons will just be melee weapons, but eventually fire arms are introduced. At this point the game turns into a Third-Person Shooter. the significant feature of Sleeping Dogs where guns are concerned, is triggering slow motion after vaulting over objects while aiming.I have borderline-exploited this feature, I will spoiler tag my trick in case you want to figure it out on your own. While in slow motion I would score head shots on anyone in cross hairs distance. After slow motion stops I would just vault over another object to enter slow motion mode again. -DrivingThere's a lot of different types of vehicles you can drive; there are boats, motorcycles, cars, buses, motorized bikes, and many more. You can shoot while in most vehicle if you have a gun while driving. You can jump out of your vehicle and hijack other vehicles. You can smash into other vehicles by using a bashing or side swipe ability (""L-Shift"" on the default keyboard controls) -Leveling/progressionThere's a lot to appreciate about the sense of progression in Sleeping Dogs! There are 3 different experience and levels: Police experience, Triad Experience, and Face Experience. Each level rewards a different skill or perk. Additionally there are many collectibles, the most important collectibles are various statues which can be returned to the Dojo in exchange for new combination hand-to-hand-techniques.-DLCUnfortunately (or maybe 'fortunately', depends on if you like my reviews. haha) I cannot write reviews for the individual DLC. But to quickly cover the DLC: It's good.There's a lot of DLC included with the Definite Edition, I think I've only gotten through a fourth of the DLC content. It's also worth noting that the Definitive edition was advertised as adding graphical improvements to the game. (It ran very well on my Windows 10 machine at 1080p, just a side note)Achievements: Oh boy... an analytical break down for the steam achievements would take far too long. At the time that I'm writing this review, I've successfully completed the story and maxed triad, police, and face experience (30 hours, many of those hours being distracted by civilian tag with cars).A good chunk of the achievements are allocated like most other games: story, extra's, missions, 100%, find all the things. I can't speak from first hand experience (yet), but a friend of mine has already earned 100% completion on the game.Price: Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is priced at $29.99 I just relaxed and enjoyed taking my time on beating the main story and I've already racked up 30 hours. with only 50% of the achievements it's safe to say I've got plenty of game time that'll increase after this review has been posted.For those of you unfamiliar with my value system: I like to get a hour out of a game for every dollar spent. So I'm saying this game was a great value, and will increase in value as I play it.Conclusion: All in all, if you like Martial Arts, Third Person shooters, Action, Open World action genre games, Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is for you. I was probably the target audience for this game, because I get really pumped while I play, in a way it helps inspire me for my next TaeKwonDo practice sessions.Special thanks to Angfucious for gifting me this game. You were 100% correct that I would love this game.P.S. The Umbrella Gang has it's eye on you. Umbrella gang! FOR UNCLE PO!


I'll probably use this for my review

Well... after finishing the story mode of the game in 2 days I can honestly say, this was an amazing journey.Introduction to the gameYou start the game as Wei Shen, a former police officer in San Francisco who's been transfered to a fictional hong kong which is split into four districts. Wei Shen has been assigned to destroy a Triad organization by the name of Sun On Yee.From there on out the game splits you into two characters - Wei Shen, police officer and Wei Shen, a member of the triad organization. Gameplay    → The Combat The combat system in this game is quite simple and easy to use, you fight with the click of your left mouse button and dodge incomming hits by pressing E at the right time. I really relish the fighting moments in the game where the character is faced off against 8 or more enemies at the same time, prooves quite a challenge at first but gets easier the more you do it. Another big thing in a lot of games are guns, not in this game though. You don't get a gun in your hand in the first 2 hours atleast into the game, you actually feel how powerful guns are in the game once you get them. You'll be spending most of the game fighting enemies with your fists or some other melee weapon rather then a pistol or an automatic.    → The VehiclesSimilarly to other games you can steal vehicles from a parking lot or the road by brutally janking the driver out, taking his place. Of course you don't have to steal vehicles, there is another to get a vehicle.There's a large variety of vehicles in the game for you to choose from. Once you obtain these vehicles in your garage you can choose 3-5 colors of your car and where you wish to recieve it from, there are multiple spots on the map from which you may take an infinite amount of these vehicles from. Some vehicles handle very nicely, others not so much. Occasionally you will run into a police situation from which you must escape and in this game it is quite easy, you just drive out of their detection zone and any ammount of police attention you had is just suddenly gone. Unfortunately there's no way of getting any air vehicles - Helicopters, planes etc. The sea vehicles are a bit of frustrating to control as they turn very slowly.    →The MinigamesSometimes you just want to take a break from the story mode but what do you do then? Do you go shoot people? Do you go explode cars? The answer is no. You go and sing karaoke ↓Me trying KaraokeIf karaoke isn't your thing you can also enjoy an exciting adrenaline rushing race in the streets of hong kong, or perhaps you feel like busting some crimes, you can!    → The collectiblesThroughout the map are placed many collectable items like statues, which you can give your old sensei in return for a new fighting technique. Then there are healing statue things which collecting will give you permanently more health, money can also be found in briefcases with sometimes a piece of clothing.     →The ExtrasYou can also purchase with ingame money clothing for Wei Shen which he will wear in any cutscene in the game, I think that's a very neat feature to the game aswell.The StoryThis game's story was really quite the journey, you can really feel the emotions of the characters in the game. Excitement, anger, grief, relief - all emotions that I've felt while playing this amazing masterpiece of a game, and if you really listen to the dialogue you will feel too. This is one of those games where once you start playing, you can't stop untill it's done.Final VertdictThis game has been a wonderful expirience for me and I suggest everyone to play it and enjoy it too. If you don't think you can run the definitve edition you should atleast buy the orginal. I'd rate this game a 10/10 for the pure depth of the game and story of it.			",454,137,11,45,31,5,29

												This game is just riddled with bugs and lags. People can sit in the car without opening the doorSecond thing is the melee fighting mechanics, which are the whole core of the game as the weapons are truly scarce. The only real strategy that works in a fight is to: 1. grap smaller opponents, beat them up, run away,  2. kick bigger opponents once, run away  3 wait for the guy with a knife to strike, counter and hope none of the others are too close, run away. I think the countering system is essentially broken, where even if your reaction time is on spot, the character just does nothing to avoid damage. Best just to run in circles and grab, grab, grab. Driving is frustrating as hell.3/10 for good story and Hong Kong			",385,104,7,21,14,0,22

												Note: This review is about the changes in ""Definitive Edition"", not about the game itself. So what is the difference between the original version and definitive edition? Not much, it's just patched original Sleeping Dogs with full DLC and some improvements to the graphic that are either insignificant or unimportant. I can play the original version at max setting with solid fps, but I have to play this one on medium because the fps are too unstable (FYI, my spec is more or less the same as recommended), I also have a problem with ingame screen resolution, it causes me to have some kind of slightly visible letterbox appears at times, which is annoying because original version didn't have it. But as I said, the changes to graphic are insignificant. World density is the only improvement that worth mentioning, which makes the world more living by adding more cars, people on streets, NPC variations (less clones),... but this change can be achieved by a free patch, not a patch being sold. Also, still no Steam Cloud, wtf dev? Seriously? In short, Sleeping Dogs is an amazing game, but this Definitive Edition is a quick cash grab, patched games being sold at high price. Don't buy it if you already owned the original version, it's not worth it.For people with spec below recommended: Don't buy it because the spec given by the dev is inaccurate, you can play it on low smoothly, but it will look worse and less stable than the original version on medium. It seems the game doesn't use up all the CPU power, but depends mostly on GPU power, which means you need a strong GPU to play this game on high smoothly.			",112,17,1,4,3,1,8

												This open world, third person action feels a lot like Saints Row with a more serious note. There's blood and scenarios are merciless.The game is mainly fought with fists, but guns are available on select missions. Some situations are crazy, specially the bike races - NPCs will ram the flag girl at the start. The rest of the way, they will go crazy on you.Car physics are not easy to control. Ramming (button) can also be used while going sideways, which could be exploited when racing or driving fast in general. If you think races are difficult, just race later after you have the prototype car - then races can get funny.Movement is also awkward (I am using a mouse and keyboard setup). Camera angles in any mode (car / bike / foot) is hard to control, and you can't look too far up (which I find weird and sometimes irritating). On foot, turning is not as precise or quick as in other games (or even compared to real life). This can be frustrating in fighting... until you realize that you can use a car or bike to win them. The game is probably programmed more towards using a gamepad.Soundtrack is good. I only started to get tired of them after more than 30 hours of playing.Graphics are good, but sometimes can't keep up when driving fast. It only required 50% at 750MHz from my GTX 770, so I think many gamers can play this game.Sound effects are amazing. It has perfect use of audio positioning and environmental sounds are there. Though, at times, motor boat and water splashing sounds were skipping (not produced) for a few seconds in intervals.The story is alright, and the story telling is fine. Events can sometimes get weird. You can't grab who you're chasing (even when you're already touching them) until you've reached the end where you'll fight a group or they simply give up; but at the same time, as part of the game rule, you can't be too far away from them (again, in a chase scenario).This game scored a 5/10 for me, but I'm labeling it as a Recommend for the story telling and overall good fun. The controls is the biggest let-down as I was forced to play with a hard to control character until I finish it. The game has a serious note, but remember that this is a game and better just take full advantage of what you can do to avoid character control, camera and other possible frustrations it could give you.

												You'd be forgiven some trepidations about any game that's charted as ... unconventional a course to retail shelves as Sleeping Dogs. It first went into development at United Front Games as ""Black Lotus,"" then transformed to a reboot of Activision's True Crime series. Then, as the mega-publisher let the game slide into the hands of Square-Enix, it lost the legacy branding and was re-redubbed Sleeping Dogs. The ship that emerges from those choppy waters is surprisingly seaworthy, but it's not without a few cracks in the hull. For some, Sleeping Dogs' leaks may be hard to ignore.Triad gangs took Hong Kong police officer Wei Shen's sister from him, and he's given up everything to take them apart. As Sleeping Dogs picks up his story, Shen's already deep undercover, embedded in a low-level position with the Sun On Yee (a thinly veiled nod to the Sun Yee On, a real-life Triad gang).Though the Hong Kong setting may be exotic, Shen's story will be familiar to anyone who's ever watched, read, or played a story of an undercover cop. As Shen gets closer to toppling the organization, he's also getting closer to its members, embracing their vicious, glamorous lifestyle until even the player may be left to wonder where, exactly, he stands.At first, the distinction between cop and criminal is easy to make. Shen has no firearms and so must rely on martial arts (and the occasional tire iron) to bring down members of rival gangs.			",296,86,9,25,26,6,44

Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is a frenzied, artistic action game that, though it is marred by slight technical difficulties, still provides an enjoyable alternative to the standard action-sandbox.Sleeping Dogs' greatest strength comes from its presentation. The developers implemented the game's open-world replica of Hong Kong painstakingly with striking visuals and smartly interconnected layouts, which help the player see this beautifully-realized city from all angles. The characters' presentations are also done in an effective manner. The effort put into the story of the main character especially pays off, as gamers can easily identify with the upbringing and struggles that drive development of protagonist Wei Shen as he searches to define himself between connections with the Hong Kong Police and the gang Sun On Yee. Wei is joined by a cast of secondary characters that would generally fall into the category of ""stereotypical"", but fortunately most have some extraordinary developments or twists that keep them from becoming stale or predictable.Comparisons between Sleeping Dogs and the Grand Theft Auto series are commonplace. However, such claims made in an attempt to denigrate Sleeping Dogs is, at best, ignorant. Martial arts motifs play a significant role in the design of the gameplay here, composing the greatest difference between this and GTA. The player lacks the GTA-standard arsenal of weapons to carry around as combat is largely focused on hand-to-hand combat. Though some later levels heavily feature guns, players will largely find themseleves using combos and counters to dispatch foes. Other mechanics, ranging from a unique on-the-road hijack system to genre-standard slow-motion sequences further reinforce the kung-fu movie feel that the game is going for.Sleeping Dogs suffers from an array of technical malfunctions and limitations. The game in general works appropriately (no issues with rendering or framerate), though on rare occasion it crashed with no warning. Because the game generates cutscenes and scripted actions in the real game environment (i.e. instead of cutscenes being full video, the background of the scene is a continuation of what is going on with NPCs in the open world), unintended consequences often result. These consequences range from the hilarious (two characters showing indifference after being run over during a cutscene) to the catastrophic (being stuck behind an invisible wall after a scripted event, requiring reset). Getting stuck is moreso an issue with platforming in this game, as it attempts to emulate Assassin's Creed's parkour system, only to provide an unrefined version, leaving many instances of floating above objets or glitching around walls where one shouldn't be. Finally, the overreliance on the counter mechanism during combat makes it difficult to fight off groups of enemies as the game cannot handle many targets to counter at once. This proves especially troublesome during the beginning of the game, when Wei is too weak to take most attacks and must abuse the counter, leading to some unfair situations. This becomes less of an issue as he grows stronger in the game.In spite of this variety of issues the game faces, it was never enough to outweigh the positive experience that playing this game provided. It offers a lengthy primary campaign, bolstered by sidequests, completion goals and simple-yet-fun minigames. The Definitive Edition provides a significant amount of bonus missions and accessories to effectively bolster the length of the game after beating the main game. Additionally, it provides two scenarios seperate from the main game to play, which are both worthwhile in their own right. Though the final result of the game faced faulty implementation due to what the game was trying to accomplish, it still succeeds in providing a more visually-enthralling, narrative driven experience than is normal for action sandbox titles, and is a worthy game in any collection. Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition gets a B.			",358,98,14,42,20,5,35

												I never play the old version of Sleeping Dogs, so I can't review the different of it.I really enjoy the story, the fighting is fluid, the animation is great, the city is alive. the graphic is good.- Audio glitch sometimes in the car, two radio play at the same time, after I leave the car, the radio still playing.- In Nightmare in North Point sometimes I punch some Jiang Shi and got it stuck under a car, then after that I can't enter the car.- I found some problematic bug/glitch with the Achievement, I need to reopen all the lockbox in Central, when I already open all 30/30 in the game, after I do reopen all the lockbox in new games, after dating at Victoria Peak, I got the achievement.Hope if there are new sleeping dogs, I need to have Taxi number in my contact, it's really help travel a lot.I'm a taxi user, sometimes npc get in, then Wei said ""Do I look like a cab driver to you?"" Good.I really enjoy the game, even I experience a bug/glitch that take me some times to get a perfect game.It's a recomended game, it's also cheaper then the previos version and also contain all the DLC.

 SLEEPING DOGS: DEFINITIVE EDITION REVIEW  Have you ever wanted to play Grand Theft Auto, but set in Hong Kong with tons of Chinese themes throughout the game. Well is Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition the game for you. The game has you playing Wei Shen an undercover cop who has to start getting in good with the Sun on Yee (Hong Kong Triad) and moving up in ranks and gaining their trust, but when Wei is getting taken off the case he insists on finishing the job he started, and that's what he intends to do.The game plays very well. The combat can be very smooth, maybe not to the extent of a Batman Arkham Game, but it's alright. Gun play in Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is a bit iffy and is only really acceptable when using a mouse, but I recommend the use of a controller for everything else. The cars control beautifully. Wei also feels very fluent on the ground when running and parkouring throughout Hong Kong.The game visually is pretty damn good and is a sight to behold. The original verson of Sleeping Dogs is no longer available on steam, but the definitive edition is basically the full package anyways. If you have a good enough pc to run it, it won't matter if the old version isn't available. GOOD GAME, COULD USE SOME ACTUAL SLEEPING DOGS NEXT TIME. 9.5/10  ",257,59,4,24,7,3,10

												I'll start this by saying that I've really enjoyed this game. A good mix between GTA and Saints Row. Story is cliche but engaging at the same time, although I was really hoping that there would be multiple endings at the end (it seemed like the story was leading to that). The game's story had the potential to top GTA's if they had put in multiple endings.GTA should do collectables like how Sleeping Dogs did it. The problem with GTA's collectables is that they had no value to it. Sleeping Dogs gave you upgrades for completing collectables. Thus, giving you the reason to go hunting them down.Combat system is one of the best for this genre, forcing you to use martial arts instead of going in guns blazing (not true for all missions, as the last few missions were gunfights). And note that I said 'for this genre'. Combat is definately not as good as the Batman series or Shadow of Mordor. And the chase scenes are amazing, as the freerunning system is simple but engaging at the same time.Problems only come in when you're trying to get all achevements and 100% the whole game. Bugs start to show, and I had to restart missions multiple times (sometimes even the whole game). Missions became tedious to do. At this point, the game got frustrating and I was playing it for the sake of completion. But this all started after the 25-30 hour mark.DLCs were mostly meh... 'Nightmare in North Point' was OK. You would probably enjoy 'Year of the Snake' if you really enjoyed the police missions in the main game.TL;DR Main story cliche but good. Brings new mechanics to the table for this genre. DLCs are meh. Game can become tedious and frustrating when trying to 100% it. Highly recommended.BTW, always remember, ""A man who never eats pork buns is never a whole man.""			",64,16,0,11,10,0,7

												[Disclaimer]Sigh* I had already finished this game twice but steam didnt record that time nor achievement because I didn't have internet at that time 24/7 so none of my time or achievement register. The ones you see are just me checking to make sure the game is still alright before doing my review. Game Info Name: Sleeping DogsDeveloper: United Front GamesGenre: Beat Em Up, Kung Fu, Action, Stealth, RacingPersonal Verdict: Ever wanted to put a leg up someones face? Do so in HD. What is Sleeping Dogs:Definitive Edition Originally Sleeping Dogs without the Definitive Edition tack to it this version sees square enix adding and adjusting the entire DLC released in Sleeping Dog previous version into something well errr, better. Anyways to the game itself.Sleeping Dog is a visceral game of Kung-Fu, betrayal, triads and friendship as we follow one Wei Shen as he does his job in the brilliantly rendered world of Hong Kong, Wei must choose between his allegiance to the triads or to his police officers as he delivers justice. One Kung-Fu at a time. Story Playing the story of Sleeping Dogs [SD] reminds me of the old action Kung-Fu movie where the story moves at breakneck speed and emotional rollercoaster happens all the time. Which is to say the story kick ♥♥♥. It delivers them in spades and is not afraid to hold back from doing all sorts of nasties that the player will no doubt witness and feel. Graphic Usually I do not like to talk much about graphics because what the heck am I suppose to write?! Exception of course are made. Sleeping Dogs treats the world of Hong Kong is pretty bland with repetitive civilian, normal texture etc etc but it really comes alive during the night and rain! Especially night and rain together in tandem! Skins exude a sheen, cars has powerful reflection upon them and everything is generally 10x better than it is during daytime. Not to say the standard graphics are bad but upping it up and witnessing the full glory of the engine in rain and night is a breathtaking experience. Sound United Front Games pulled no punches in making sure we get the most authenthic experience for our stay in Hong Kong. Random quips in Cantonese can be heard as you walk the streets, Character that do not speak english instead does full Cantonese dialogue. The crisp clear audio makes subtitle a secondary thing as oppose to be a mandatory on for most games and every effect down to the last mission complete evoke a strangely nostalgic chinese feel. Gameplay Ah Sleeping Dogs, I turn you on, kick a few citizen stuff them into the boot of their car then kill them right in front of the hospital with my KUNG-FU. What better way to start a monday.In an otherwise typical fare of open world game Sleeping Dog does the competition shame by focusing on one aspect many game have neglected: The melee system. While initially the melee system seems easy with 1 hko object scattered all over the enviroment and enemies come in weak and puny form they soon ramp it up especially towards midgame where you will be punching, kicking and hurling foes off rail while covered in blood. Essentially press counter when enemy glow red, punch them up till they die and then when the meter is full use face mode to recover health and make your enemy fear you. Along the way explore the world! Beat up people in side activities to uncover drug raids, beat people up again to obtain chests of money and clothing. Turn Wei into the most fashion savvy freak with the game large customization option. Engage in daring fights as you beat up people to get money and more face value! Or perhaps you're a picky one eh? Want a bit of dialogue and action in your beat em up? Look no further. Turn into a cop hunt down people as you become the scourge of the underworld, help your eccentric group of buddies as they get into random hijinks that often ends with beating people up. Or you know, just help around the citizen of Hong Kong, they could use a help from a friendly people-beating gangster. But alas the gunplay fall shorts, since most resources went into fighting people up the gun lacks recoil, feels plasticky and holds no weight. Cleverly the game wave them away from most mission by stating ""HONG KONG DON'T ALLOW GUNS!"" it works for me it should works for you. The car good to say however is awesome and a joy to ride, and since you can simply steal a car it doesnt matter if you're walking on foot, simply steal a car and be on your way. Or you can use the car valet. Eh. Fun feature includes the ability to steal cars within a car without going out. Amazing when you think about it since you don't have to dismount but can happily continue your ride in a shiny new car as the wreck of your old ones burns behind you.Completing mission earns you triad points by being brutal and police point for being civilised lawful cop. Leveling up gives you a choice of perk within the skill tree. An oddly choice of collectible, side missions and all that jazz ensures you won't be bored of the game anytime soon.  Conclusion How I wish i could experience it all over again, the powerful gunfight, desperate Kung-Fu action and emotional story. Why does more game can be this way? Alas a few minor issues does bog it down though. But does this makes it a bad game? It is an excellent game released suddenly to our world. Buy it already I am tired of typing this all out. Basically this game is awesome.Scoring Methology [Courtesy of Meat King]:-	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorVerdict: A++ RankCheck out the Original Network Groups.

												10/10 Amazing GameI have finished the original version multiple times already and am still amazingly impressed by it's realistic feel of Hong Kong and how it's archetecture reflects on various different area's. Most would know Triads did exist around year 1950 and were incorporated into the game so realisticly and did things real triads did (Trafficing Drugs, fighting and prostitution) and being able to play through it as Wei Shen is like being in HK. Triad groups in the game were based on the real Son Yee On and 14K as they were real enemies.I love the use of stereotypes in the game and found them especially funny because i do speak Cantonese as a first language and i am astonished at how accurately dialogue in the city is put into a game where you can freely explore the vibrant culture of HK.It is a game you can keep on playing, and never get bored of.

												A suspense action-thriller, organized crime story, of a multidimensional Asian American undercover agent, whose loyalty is tested in extreme circumstances brought by a dark past he left behind.Hugely underrated, Sleeping Dogs is the surprise cult hit of 2012, and delivered an honorable tribute to masterpiece films, such as Infernal Affairs, and its Hollywood remake, The Departed.Sandbox gameplay set in a highly detailed cosmopolitan city, fully fleshed out with fresh style of slick eastern-esque aesthetics, well suited for the enigmatic Hong Kong Triad theme. Primary combat is raw hand-to-hand packed with myriad true-to-life martial techniques to employ; a feature that adds to its unique flavor when compared to GTA or Watch Dogs.Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition (2014) is more than worth the asked price point.

												It's like a Bruce Lee kung fu movie married with a Jackie Chan Hong Kong police detective movie, in a GTA-style engine.  The only truly open world GTA-like engine i know of where you're not playing a degenerate thug, there's LA Noire but everyone says it is unfortunately very light on the open world aspect, and there's Just Cause where you're a government thug.This game is not in the least overrated, I'd say it's a little underrated, it has story, it has cinematics, it has a full brawler martial arts combat system. It deserves its M rating however. ",2269,951,84,246,324,24,372

												For those waiting for GTA V or a similar open world type game, Sleeping Dogs fills the gap suitably. The structure of the game is no surprise for any GTA player, or if you have played the previous True Crime games, with the only major difference here is that the game's combat is based on a Batman-style melee approach, which is suitably fun once you get the hang of it and identify the various moves. It does get a bit repetative towards the end of the main mission set, but that's common with most open world games; there's also a good deal of completionist gathering one can go after. However, elements like the story itself are somewhat lackluster - you can get an idea where the story is heading early on, and there's not much redeeming or vile about any of the characters. The Definition Edition includes two packs of DLC, both adding another 2-3 hr each of gameplay. The second one, Year of the Snake, feels like a good single movie in terms of plot (attempting to stop a cult bombing the city), while the first one has fun elements of movies like Big Trouble in Little China in it. The only issue that I have against the game is a lack of technical updates from the publisher, which many have commented on the forums. In my case, I had started the game, and during that time had to update a completely separate hardware driver for a camera device, among other things. This caused the game to be inoperable. Only until I was at a point that I had replaced the camera with a different one, did the game then work fine. As one of the few troubleshooting tips they have given has been to disconnect all USB devices which have worked for some but not all, this might create a technical problem for you.

												Sleepings Dogs: Definitive Edition,Is the first game in its genre that's actually able to keep me interested. Game's like GTA and Saints Row, which do a good job on their own, don't come even close to what Sleeping Dogs offers me when it comes down to gameplay, handling, atmosphere, voice overs and hints of reality.The city of (virtual) Honk Kong is beautifully dirty and down to earth. The people all look very realistic and not like some comic book character. The cars look the way they should look: normal.There're many mini games throughout the main game and they all blend in perfectly and make sens in one way or another. It's nothing stupid, but fitting.Another good thing is that random violence is not rewarded, but rather punished. Especially when doing a mission.If you're looking for a game that's very similar to GTA or Saints Row, but want a somewhat more realistic setting, then get Sleeping Dogs. It provides action, drama, fun and visuals for content tourists; all on a very, very high level.The two DLC's that come with the definitive edition provide each 2-3 hours of extra gameplay and I've got to be honest that the ""year of the Snake"" DLC suprised me in a very positive way. That's because you're actually playing as a police officer. (Wearing the uniform and all) As which your main goal is to cover up some cultist scheme and to arrest people.

												The Definitive edition of the Sleeping Dogs game is all in all very good, Yet it has some major flaws not even the first release had. 1. Finnished missions and submissions like Thousant Cuts cannot be replayer again. There is a little left to do after the main story is finnished. I Finished everything and still didn´t reached the full XP in Triad section - now I cannot even replay the old missions in order to do them better and recieve some additional Triad XP.2. When I I pick up pistol with Wei anywhere, including the golden version which is granted after upon finnishing the main story, or even guns which are part of the costume, e.g. Hitman, S.W.A.T, etc. - for some reason Wei looses this gun when put in holster after few minuted of playing. For instance, I picked up the golden pistol at home, went to garage, took some car, drove around few blocks, then someone crashed my car, I wanted to shoot like drive-by, and I realized, I have no gun!!! This happens all the time :/3. When practicing with the wood men, there is horrible noise like crushing wood in the first few hits. And this wasn´t the problem in regular Sleeping Dogs. I believe it is some sort of bug. It would be nice if it could be fixed. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I probably should have left this review on the original Sleeping Dogs game, but here we go anyways. Probably contains spoilers so consider yourself warned.\\ Story:The story is an amazingly tangled mess of triad fighting and personal choices. It is going to break you down inside and i was left a crying mess throughout the game. It should be said that i am very easily attached to, and affected by things. The wedding, where the oh so sad love song always plays before ♥♥♥♥ is going down, Uncle Po, and not to forget the most horrible death of them all (to me at least), Jackie.. The last had me bawling my eyes out because the story and character had sucked me in (and i kinda had a minor crush on Edison Chen). Anyhow, the story is solid, A+. \\ Gameplay and graphics:The improved graphics are stunning, and almost killed my computer because i was overly confident while choosing the ultra high settings. It was definitely worth the upgrade and it was even more immersive this time around than the first. I sat for eight hours the first day and ten hours the second to finish the game and i've never gotten so sucked into anything before. The vibrant colors and the city itself feels even more realistic now. I love the random encounters with people selling art and birds and whatnot too. And the food looks so amazingly good i just keep drooling every time i look at it.The only thing that annoyed me was towards the end of the game when the car valet kept saying he was busy and couldnt deliver to you, but apart from that i have nothing negative to say. Easily one of my favorite games and one of the best i've played so far.			",235,157,2,74,67,0,30

												I absolutely love this game.  I got 100% on ps3, close to 100% on the older version on pc, and I plan on doing 100% again now for this version.  After an hour with the definitive edition I can already tell there are a lot of differences between versions, and I am happy to say so far they are all for the better.  If you are a fan of open world games this one should be at the top of your list of games to play.			",235,13,8,19,4,1,21

The hand to hand combat is nice not perfect but good non the less. The open world activities are not much unfortunatly, but adds something to do when you just want to crause in your cool car or bike and take a look at the BEATIFULY made world :3.

												I have to admit that I only bought this game because I was in the mood for a GTA-like free-roam game. The game is awesome. Very enjoyable to play and tons of things to do in Hong Kong, from bursting in street races to betting on animal fights. The only negative thing in this for me are the DLCs which feel rushed and needless. Definitely a nice and stylish game.			",61,2,0,10,2,0,5

												Had some pretty serious graphics issues with this game until I got a 144hz monitor. Many false starts due to graphics issues. Finally gave this a good shot, and I am not sorry I did.This game is one of the better GTA style games. Some familiar concepts but it brings a lot of new ideas to the table. Playing as an undercover cop is a new way of looking at these crime sim games, and adds a level of character complexity to the game. If you have this in your library and never really started it, (I can see many of you do on my  friends list) give this another shot.			",627,162,11,125,73,6,98

												Spoiler free review.I like this game more than gta-series. Mainly because it has more serious story. Gta is fun, but i just personally prefer more serious approach. The story tells of an undercover cop, infiltrating and destroying a triad organization from within, but eventually, he becomes friends with them, and starts to notice, they might not be as bad as he thought. They're just humans, with relationship, and hardships in life that drove them to the criminal path.I really liked this aspect, it wasn't the basic ""good guys are good guys, and bad guys are bad guys"" type of setting. It was an interesting plot to follow.The city itself is lively, fun to explore, parkour aspect contributes to the joy of exploring, and gives new areas where to go. Sidequests are plenty, helping people, learning new martial art moves and hunting for collectibles. There's also police missions, in addition to the triad ones. But it seems they didn't really explore how they wuold collide, like really give a hint that you're on the danger of revealing yourself to the triad during the police missions.------------------The DLC-------------------------Definitive edition comes with all of them, of course. The first being integrate into the game, the zodiac tournament, is a fun little nod to Bruce Lee, and the one i found most enjoyable of the 3 biggest story dlc's. Nightmare in North Point is a horror themed, little and short dlc set only in North point, not much story. My second favorite of these ones.The last one, year of the snake continues from the main story, basically for the intro video. It was a big letdown, i mean a BIG. After the intro video, it's just mainly cop missions from the main game, put one after atnoher, and after few of them, it's done. That's it. There's some minor story dialoque in some ""missions"", when Wei is driving a car and talking on the phone for example. It seemed to me, that it was putten together hastily. When Zodiac tournament and Nightmare had more proper feel to them.			",396,158,8,45,43,3,41

												Probably one of the greatest, if not THE greatest underrated game ever. I've replayed this 3 times on the PS3, 4 times on the PS4, and now going through my 2nd playthrough on PC. This game has a nice blend of badass kung-fu with equally badass gunfights. The story is great. You infiltrate, as an undercover officer of the law, into a ruthless Chinese Triad syndicate in Hong Kong, surrounded by people you knew in your childhood, and you must take down the entire Triad syndicate using legal and morally right methods, however, you also have a grudge against some of these guys, for what they did to your sister. The story, fighting, and side activites (which could've been better but are still fun to do) made me drawn to this game. It's great, and at $7.50, it's a steal.			",45,1,1,7,4,1,2

												After playing through this game I can safely say it is one of those titles anyone must play.Sleeping dogs doesn't attempt to be a GTA or Saints Row clone. It has it's own vibe. Including being set in a sort of underrepresented setting: Modern day Hong Kong. The amount of variation of scenery is pretty nice for the size of the map.The story is in no way generic, either. Expect a nice variety of missions. The presentation is straight on and the controls are very fluid. Dealing with mobs of enemies using Kung-Fu never felt more satisfying, rewarding you for knowing when to strike, for how long and when to counter.The main storyline is about 10 hours of gameplay long, but the side cases and expansions most certainly add a lot to that.Definitely get this and play it.

												Nice and pretty smooth. After comparing both versions. Definitive Edition has better lighting, response, and control. Some of the glitches are still there with AI and main character. Overall I would still recommend the game to those that never bough the original. DLC's are included, except they are apart of the story line. Unlike the Original Version, Once you bought certain DLC's, the clothing or vehicles would be easily/readily accesible, not in this edition, you have to work (i.e. buy them) for them.

												If you have played the original Sleeping Dogs released back In 2012 then you're probaly wondering why you should get the game again,well simply put the game Is amazing and Is more detailed and better looking then ever.The lighting In this game Is absolutely amazing and Is noticeable especially at night and when It Is raining,plus with the addition of Volumetric Fog you really feel like you're In Hong Kong.Also another Inprovement over the original release Is the Increase of NPC's roaming the street's of Hong Kong,more pedestrian's walking and the Increase of traffic throughout the city really bring's the game to life and give's you the feeling of the reality of everyday Hong Kong,the Night Market was one of my favourite place's In the game due to the fact that It Is absolutely crowded with NPC'S and you can constantly hear people yelling out to either yourself or other NPC'S trying to sell food or clothing,It make's you feel like you're In the everyday market's that are packed In Hong Kong.From the story's point of view I think It Is very well done and It Is really Interesting,I wasn't bored at any point during the game and the action got better and better as the story progressed,I would buy this game again just for the sake of the story alone because It Is very good.From the technical point of the game It Is extremely well optimized with a constant 60FPS! at 1080P however the extreme Anti Aliasing setting which use's SSAA Is extremely demanding and i would turn the setting down to high as I noticed no major difference in picture quality but did get better performance,also there was no game breaking bug's or freeze's.I would recommended this game to everybody,the story Is absolutely solid!,there Is plenty and I mean plenty of side mission's,collectibles and DLC's to be enthralled In.and also lot's of action packed fun exploring Hong Kong.So would I recommend people who bought the original Sleeping Dogs back In 2012 to buy the game again,absolutely!  If you never played Sleepings Dogs before,well then you must buy this game,It Is a one of a kind game and to both fan's and newcomer's of the game,It truly Is the Definitive Edition!

												Sleeping Dogs was originally released on August 13, 2012 for Xbox 360, PS3, and PC. It was recently released on Xbox One and PS4 as well. It was developed by United Front Games and published by Square Enix. It received a 9 out of 10 on Steam, 4 out of 5 on Metacritic and an 8.5 out of 10 on IGN.While most people consider Sleeping Dogs a GTA knock off set in Hong Kong, I would argue that perception is false. While the initial concept is the same, an open world crime game, the basic mechanics of Sleeping Dogs sets it apart. These mechanics include cop/triad alliances, a focus on melee combat, and a Max Payne esque bullet time when sliding over objects during gun play.Because of the great implementation of the aforementioned mechanics, the smaller size of the open world compared to similar releases such as GTA and Watch_Dogs, still provides a fantastic experience.The story in follows an ex San Francisco cop that has been thrown back into the world of the Triads in modern day Hong Kong. While the story may seem cliche at first, if you give it some time you will find a rewarding plot line to follow.The Definitive Edition includes six downloadable content packages for your consumption, and with the current holiday sale on Steam, is well worth the additional cost.

												One of the most highly underrated open-world action single player game to come out.  The story is based on a lot of similarties to most HK typical traid vs traid vs police.  However the story is very well done and well paced.  The melee combat is fun and fluid once you get the hang of it and does not take long.  The gunplay is very familair to max payne, which is a good thing.  The graphics still holds up really well with this definitive edition even though this game is almost 5 years old.  The city looks amazing at night with all the lights and reflections. The city really feels alive with lots of npcs, cars,stores, attractions, etc.  Also if you do play in very high resolution like 2k or 4K like myself, there is a UI scale option which is perfect.The voice acting are excellent.  Some very big name in the asian film industry gave the voices to the game and really shines during cutscenes.  The soundtrack also very good.  With mix of chinese traditional music, to hip-hop, instrumentals, dance, and pop songs.   I often took longer route to my destination just to hear more of the music, which says a lot.  Car controls well and is definately way better than most open world and even more of the recent releases.  This game really didn't get a lot of attention when it first released but it should not be missed.  One of the best sleeper hit to come out in the past 5 years.			",79,7,0,24,2,0,3

												~ One of the best games that I have ever played! ~It's a gorgeous 3rd person shooter! It includes a ton of DLC, which are rebalanced and properly integrated into the game's story, unlike the standard edition of Sleeping Dogs. The DLC do not give you an unfair advantage anymore. Also, some DLC are unlocked as you progress through the main story and there are two more DLC that can be accessed from the Main Menu, which are separated from the main game.It's a great PC port, featuring DX11 support and an integrated high-res texture pack.

												I've already reviewed the regular edition, so I've moved that review over with a few additional Definitive Edition-specific comments. The good: This is one of my favorite games, so I could probably fill a page with ""the good."" I find the story line extremely enjoyable. Being an undercover cop gives you a chance to cause mayhem while not feeling like a total dirtbag. The interactions between the player & NPCs are fun, and the voice acting is good. The setting and story really make you pull for a lot of different sides and think about life and family. The atmosphere is excellent. Hong Kong feels very vibrant and alive. The fighting system is one of my favorites. There are few guns available in this game; instead, the game mostly relies on martial arts. There's a gym where you can practice your moves before you take on street thugs and rival triads. The bad: The driving is kind of awful. I've tried it with a controller and liked it slightly better, but it still wasn't great. However, once you get used to it, it's playable, if a little frustrating. I thought the main campaign was rather short. It's an open world game with lots of side quests, but the way each of the main quests comes up sort of gives you an urgency that can push you through the game at a faster pace. I raced through a lot of the main quest and suddenly went, oh, that's the end? Definitive Edition comments: Almost all of the DLCs from the original edition were bundled into the Definitive Edition. They removed the (what I considered to be) game-breaking DLCs that gave you tons of money and XP right at the beginning, so the game progresses in a much more natural fashion now. All the outfits previously added by the DLCs are available for purchase at the Night Market; Wheels of Fury missions are now spread out so that you don't gain a super OP car immediately. The textures, graphics, and higher population density of the Definitive Edition may cause performance issues on some systems. I have an Nvidia graphics card and had to play with my settings to get the game to run on that card rather than my integrated graphics. General info: The open world provides ample opportunity for exploration and side quests. The story is great and the world is very atmospheric (Hong Kong makes a nice change from the generic cities a lot of games are set in). The art style is fairly good (better with the HD textures). Overall: I would definitely recommend this game! If you haven't played it yet, you need to!System Specs Used: Intel Core i7-3610QM, Nvidia GeForce GTX 670M / 3GB GDDR5, DDRIII 12GB RAM, Windows 7			",182,71,2,25,11,1,10

												Sleeping Dogs takes you on a blood-spattered journey through the violent Hong Kong underworld as undercover cop Wei Shen, a man torn between two worlds and not wholly of either one. The game is a sandbox crime sim and is closer to Grand Theft Auto then to Saints Row in terms of gameplay, but is generally more enjoyable to play then the former. It does however lack any kind of multiplayer, which I am sure would be very offputting for some. While it places a much lower emphasis on shooting then most games in the genre, it flavors its gunfights with bullet time- but most of the time, Wei engages his foes with a brutal combination of strikes, counters and throws, coupled with some very painful-looking environmental finishers (table saws, spikes, furnaces, fan blades- the list goes on) You unlock additional melee techniques along the way and while the fights may eventually get stale and lack the tactical depth of say, the Batman: Arkham games, they remain a cut above the drunken flailing that passes for melee in GTA V. Unlike the purely aesthetic clothing options in GTA V, clothing in Sleeping Dogs can provide bonuses when worn as a set.  Driving is manageable, though most the cars do not handle very well and you will find yourself grinding a lot of hard surfaces at speed. However, you have the ability to jolt your car left, right or forwards to ram other cars, which is both useful and entertaining. Bullet time also kicks in when aiming a gun from a car, making engaging pursuers infinitely easier. As per standard for the genre, there are a multitude of collectables scattered about the map. While the lockboxes reward only some money and occasionally clothes and the security camera hacks offer no reward at all, the shrines confer a maximum health upgrade for every five shrines found and are absolutely vital, as finding them all doubles Wei's starting health. Luckily, you unlock the ability to see the shrines on your map early on, and like GTA V, the entire city is available to explore at the start, barring only a few story mission-only areas.  This ""definitive"" edition of the game includes almost all of the DLCs- fair enough, considering the vanilla edition is no longer available (Wow Squarenix, really?) These include a number of extra outfits, vehicles and missions that if used/done during the course of a playthrough will make the core content much easier, especially the police tactical gear that cuts all damage you take in half. There are a pair of mini-story addons, one dealing with a prototype, gatling-equipped supercar and the other a martial arts tournament ripped straight out of Enter the Dragon, which offers up some of the most difficult melee fights in the game. Money is also no object beyond the first few hours of the story, beginning with the fact that you can run over parking meters to get it! There are also a pair of full story addons: Nightmare on North Point is your standard horror-flavored DLC that has you fighting Jiang Shi vampires, Yaoguai demons and the ghosts of enemies fought in the main campaign. The second, Year of the Snake, sees Wei back on the force and combating a bomb-crazy doomsday cult on Chinese New Year's. While Nightmare has new enemies and Snake has some good gunfights, both DLCs are somewhat repetitive and are not up to the same quality as the core campaign. They are, however, short enough that they do not overstay their welcome. Though I played these addons after completing the story, you may wish to complete Year of the Snake earlier on as it adds a tear-gas grenade launcher to your main playthrough. Overall, I enjoyed Sleeping Dogs and found it more then worth its lowered price. If you enjoy sandbox crime games, Sleeping Dogs is certainly worth your time.			",332,6,5,16,2,1,15

												It is way better than I thought.This game is something between Saints Row and GTA without that many guns.Story is good and it gets better the deeper you are in the story.After 40 hours I still had lot things to do. This map is filled with collectibles of all kind.Only downside is older graphics and sometimes controls.			",326,75,10,31,23,3,29

												While I like the graphical improvements and other tweaks, I must say I'm somewhat disappointed with the lack of bug fixes.  There's a few times where you can fail a mission randomly due to bad AI (ie: if you have an ally driving for you and they flip the car) or just some inexplicable auto-fails.  Nonetheless, the concept of the game is very appealing and is mostly well done.  It doesn't have the same polish as GTA in some ways but the martial arts combat system and parkour is way more advanced than what GTA has.  One terrible thing in this game is that you can't seem to hail a cab without car jacking half the time.  Nobody thought of using  another button for the car jacking?  Bugs and minor headaches aside, it's definitely a buy if you haven't played the original version and love games like GTA and Saints Row.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played the original Sleeping Dogs quite a bit since 2013 and it has grown to be one of my favorite games of all time. So much so that I figured it would be a crime if I did not buy the new Definitive Edition. After play for an hour, I have to say that I am impressed by the Definitive Edition. Right off the bat, the menu is ultra-sharp, even in 1920x1080p. Even the menu sounds and menu music quality have been improved! The introduction is better than ever; I had an absolute BLAST with the new destruction mechanics in the beginning chase and fights. I threw an enemy at a cabinet and the drawers of the cabinet actually came out and papers flew out. Then, I slammed a metal gate in the market on top of an enemy and it actually bent in the middle. This kind of stuff never happened before... I love it! The electronic street signs have been improved (all the textures too) to make Hong Kong look better than ever. The rain effects look phenomenal, and I have realized that the map, loading dragon, in-game floating HUD icons, etc. are almost 4k sharp. Many other elements of the game have been improved as wellIf you already have Sleeping Dogs and love it to death (and have extra money), get it. If you have not played it at all, get it. If you already have the Definitive Edition, play it! :)			",53,10,0,6,8,0,3

												It's a really good GTA clone that recreates the tone of classic Cantonese action flicks. What makes it interesting is that it incorporates an Arkham-style martial arts fight system with the guns and cars.Note that this ""definitive"" edition comes with all of the DLC they ever produced, and a lot of it is way off tone from the base game. The costume/moveset addons let you conduct undercover police operations dressed as Wukong the monkey king, or cosplaying as Jensen from Deus Ex. There's a series of optional missions in which you build a ridiculous Bond car with an EMP generator and dual minigun turrets. The story DLCs are also pretty zany. There's an optional mission where you get sucked into a '70s kung fu grindhouse movie, and an expansion that's a horror comedy about an invasion of hopping vampires. So if you're big on immersion and just want to stick to the Infernal Affairs-style cop movie storyline you'll probably want to avoid doing any of the DLC.If you're looking for an open world game without any of GTA's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, this is definitely worth buying during a sale.

												Sleepy Dogs is one of my all time favorite open world games. I played this game for the first time last year and promised myself that I would eventually buy all of the DLC and replay the game eventually.  When the Definitive edition came out, I knew I had to get it immediately.  The DE sprinkles the newly unlocked DLC throughout the story so you are not immediately over powered at the start with crazy guns/cars/money.  That was a very good thing and added much to the overall gameplay.  The graphic upgrade was a nice touch as well.  In all, if you are thinking about buying Sleeping Dogs the DE is definitely the one to get.2015 Edit: After playing GTA 5, I can safely say that I enjoyed my time with this game more than Grand Theft Auto. I wish that Sleepy Dogs could have a touch more of the amazing world building that GTA has. But that's it. I S ranked this game and would STILL be willing to take another spin in the world of Sleepy Dogs.			",196,60,12,50,25,1,49

												If you're familiar with the  True Crime series, this is the spiritual successor! absolutely beautiful graphics, gripping story line, lovable characters, fun combat system(almost like the PS2 classic  The Warriors ) though not to be mistaken for a GTA clone, there are firefights, this game is mainly filled with hand-to-hand combat, kung-fu style! with added environmental attacks (which can be pretty gruesome, if gore isn't your thing)The DLCs leave a little something to be desired, and feel quite rushed, but they are still worth checking out for your Sleeping Dogs fix! There are a tonne of side-quests, collectibles, cars, and clothes to collect/buy also! I have bought this game for PS3, Xbox and PC twice, it is absolutely stunning, and I 100% recommend it!

												Graphic is improved obviously. But the control is not as good as the original Sleeping Dogs I played 1 year ago. First is the control, its  not as responsive as before, plus the camera is a bit frustrating, its hard to adjust the camera when I am driving. And button mapping is different than the original Sleepiong Dogs, I like the original button mapping, E for hijack/talk/interact, right click for counter, and space for running/ramming vehicle/climbing. In this definitive edition, counter/hijack/ interact is the same buttong. Running and climbing using left shift, took a while to adjust the control. Not serious problem, but it could be better. I like the fighting mechanism in this game, tho the unresponsive control sometimes makes me go into rage, I can still manage my mental state good enoughThe game's content is great, worth the price, but why does it have to be vampires? And Wei only has his fist to fight the vampires and sword (sometimes) only to kill demon, this is Wei too much man. 5 vampires jumped at me, I counter, the result of unresponsive control, got bitten a lot, and when u are faced with 5 vampires and the jiang shi, a little bit chaos. Last is the clothing, why does 1 outfit has to be worn as 1, I can wear them separately. Dont like it. And the super fast police car is tied to the side mission only. Cmon, it would be fun to be able to ride this epic fast car in a free roam and mess with the police when I'm in it. And when it comes to driving in a race with super fast car, get ready to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Remember the camera? Yeah, the camera is the main enemy here. I am going to buy a controller for this game, I hope it would improve my in game experience.Conclusion, recommended, but only if you didnt buy the original one. ",348,56,3,70,14,1,18

												A very good game, it's very addictive and enjoyable to play. I recommend if you enjoy open world games like GTA and Saints Row, it's simular to that, but unlike those games that are US based, Sleeping Dogs is refreshingly oriental, based in Hong Kong. With good martial arts combat.This is a open world game, with martial arts, crime, street racing, gambling,  with main missions, various side quests and hunting for collectibles. You don't get to use guns till later on.The main character you play as is Wei Shen a undercover cop who infiltrates and works with the triads to try and take them down, so you get to partake in criminal activities without really being a criminal and find yourself getting deeper into the criminal world. The story is very good and I could not help but feel sad when certain things happened even though they are criminals.The driving in the game at first feels terrible, until you get cars with better handling.Only thing I really hated was the phone tracing mini game, at first I did not get what I had to do, you have a limited time to trace the person and I kept failing it and having to start it all over again. And even when I did get it, it usually takes me a couple of tries as it does not give you enough time.The only thing  that was a bit weird was that enemies can put their fists up to block, but Wei has no block ability, he can only use counter on most attacks used on him.I didn't experience any major glitches or problems with this game.I had minor glitches such as a few times when entering a car Wei would get flung away from the car, causing a mission to fail as it said I left the area :pWith the DLC's they are short and I enjoyed Nightmare in North Point, it had an overall creepy feel to it.  Year of the Snake even shorter and not as fun. Zodiac Tournament was alright, a bit annoying.It's good that the DLC is included in the definitive addition as to me they don't seem worth paying extra for as they are very short and don't have much content and are more like tacked on side missions. And the bad thing about the Dlc's is they are seperate from the main game and you can't use clothing and cars that you have previously bought so you end up stuck with only boring police vehicles in your garage when you play the year of the snake and no awesome DZS-90 wheels of fury car.Short DLC aside This is a must play game, a game is really good to me when I can't stand the thought that it's going to end. I highly recommend this game. 8/10 a must play.			",74,18,0,13,12,1,2

												I read that a lot of people compare it to GTA. Since I don't play GTA, this review will try to cover and talk about aspects that maybe GTA has too. Therefore, sorry if some of the points may look, from your point of view, like something to be expected from a 2014 game and shouldn't be seen as selling points.The plot is truly interesting, and although is widely known that you take the role of an undercover cop, things are not as plain as it may seem. You're not an average undercover cop, you're a person suited to fill that role, with a particular psychological profile. You'll infiltrate in a main branch of the Triad, in Hong Kong, and things won't go as smooth as you'd like. That profile won't help and you'll get caught in something a bit more deep, a bit more scary, a bit more of your own.It won't be about choosing sides, it will be more about merging in both, without leaving any trace, nor any part of you.It will be more about swimming inside a stream, while trying not to follow its flow.Gameplay - Wise, I didn't feel disappointed at all. The environment is gorgeus, accurate, colourful yet gray. Turns, hills, alleys, signs.Driving is fun but steering is a must, and makes things more exciting. Shame there aren't many car models. You can't steal a car and make it yours by driving it into your parking lot, but you'll own many cars, obtained by buying them or by doing main missions and / or side missions. Same applies for motorcycles.While cars can't be customized, noone says that you can't steal them and drive them through all Hong Kong, shooting at other cars' tires or directly at their front window. Aim well for a clean headshot, will you? Or if you feel like you need a new car, keep putting the pedal to the metal, jump from your seat to the roof of your new love interest or hit them until they'll stop driving.And there will be lot of pursuits. Relentless pursuits. Be it in North Point or in the highway, drive wherever you want, just get rid of the pursuers. This is one of the things I liked most from the game, as it's one of the few cases where you'll hold a firearm and you'll see cars exploding.Because what has been seen by many as a flaw, my eyes and my racing heart tells me otherwise.Firearms are rare, very rare so that you won't feel overpowered and start a killing spree. You'll treasure them and hide them. You won't waste bullets and you'll scavenge a lot. And you'll enjoy the moment when you'll use your gun to set a car on fire, or while taking cover behind a counter, against a volley of bullets.Gunfires will make you remind that you're made of flesh, so don't try to run against your enemies. Take cover and plan the right time to shoot.This scarce source of guns makes hand-to-hand combat the way to clean the path ahead of you. Keep countering, break their arms, thair legs, their teeth. Use everything at your disposal: a fan, a swordfish, a boiler, a railing, or take them hostages and use their bodies as shields, or put them inside the boot; they may change their minds.There's still more, but I don't think I should spoil everything.Secondary missions are interesting, they add layers to an already thick background, encouraging you to live this game more deeply, on both sides of the same coin.They will encourage you to explore to the fullest the map, uncovering favors, races, secrets and so on.Buy it, because I didn't tell you everything, and because it deserves more sunlight than shades.

												Wanna learn kung fu? Ez, play this game. Why even attack the enemy when you can always counter his attacks?? Although there were not any actual dogs sleeping in-game, that isn't really a deal breaker for me. Its a 3rd person open world game which many will refer as a ""cheap ripoff of GTA"".. if you encounter any of those people you should tell them to stfu and ♥♥♥♥♥ slap them because it isn't. The story is good (but 2 short 4 me) and in the definitive edition graphics have been improved, fighting mechanism is awesome just like the ones you can find in the batman series. The only downside for me is that the driving is a bit stiff (just like ♥♥♥♥ing watch dogs ♥♥♥♥♥ hell..). And also the game is set in Hong Kong which is what makes the game unique and more fun. Overall I rate this game 9/11 as it totally deserves it.			",19,2,1,1,2,0,0

												2013 - Rushed through campaign and really enjoyed the gangsta/cop story, 24 achievements.2016 - Bought the definitive edition on sale and played all of the content. 59 achievements and didn't get tired of the game until I had to get 30 gold awards + 5 for the Nightmare In Northpoint DLC which was actually pretty fun for about an episode or 2's worth of time.So the reason I went back to this game and 100 percented it.I love this game. It's as simple as that honestly. Sleeping Dogs has a great Oriental Cop/Gangster story, its like Super Cop meets Enter the Dragon meets some badass movie with Triad gangsters in it. You are Wei Shen an undercover cop bent on infiltrating the Triad and bringing down the worst of them for justice and possibly revenge. Sure the gameplay is a GTA clone but honestly why would you care? The GTA series were great games and Sleeping Dogs is the Oriental cousin GTA never really had. The story has a good familiar feel to it and is a little predictable at some points but this shouldnt discourage you if you are a fan of the genre. The extra content from the DLC's are fun concepts especially Nightmare In Northpoint, I wasn't a fan of Year of the Snake but I feel like outside of story content the Wheels of Fury DLC made up for what YoTS lacked and that is the DZS-90 (please drive irresponsibly).Combat is very fun throughout the game but can get very repetitious as per usual with this genre. also I loved the missions, most of them are quick and easy and somewhat challenging. Alot of costumes you get from the extra content directly affect your combat strength/XP gains.Dating in the game is a means to an end and the only regretful aspect.The achievement system is actually super easy. They are a little grindy but easily doable.Thanks for reading this short review I give this game 8/10 enjoy!			",192,73,0,48,7,1,26

												Before I start my review of this product, I would like to mention that this is one of my first gaming experiences on the PC and this game has won me over. At the time of reviewing this, I have put in 90 or so minutes into the game so you could consider this a first impressions review. OverviewSleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is a revamp of Sleeping Dogs with improved graphics. Wei Shen finds himself at ends when he gets in too deep with the gangs of Hong Kong as you work undercover for the police to infiltrate the Sun On Yee gang. Rating/Topic+ GraphicsLet's start at the graphics, which is a selling point for the definitive edition. The game looks amazing and the city of Hong Kong has a feeling of immersion like nothing I have played before. The graphics are great and they do live up to the marketing of the definitive edition. Overall, this department is solid. - ControlsMy second topic is the controls for keyboard and mouse. I really am not a fan of them, but I don't like KB&M for most third person games either. I guess they are okay if you are good with a keyboard and mouse in third person games, but I found it to be a much better experience on the Xbox One controller. The game recognized the controller immediately and I was very satisfied without needing to change any of the default controls. The KB&M controls aren't as stellar as the graphics, but they are decent. I recommend a controller to get the best experience for this game.+ Storyline The storyline is a modern masterpiece. I have played only 90 minutes, yet I can say that the story has excellent pacing and makes you think about your actions. I went in playing the game like GTA, but every car you steal and every rival thug you beat up alters your opinion and immerses you into the game like nothing I have experienced. I can't emphasize how enjoyable it is to play this game. After a session of gaming, I sit back as if I am Wei Sheng and contemplate my actions like the game is real life. Overall, the story is amazing and is a huge selling point of this game.+ CombatThe combat is simple enough for me as someone who does not play fighting games, I found the combat sequences to be at a good middle ground for difficulty. The camera shakes as you slam someone against the wall and you can feel each hit you put on your opponent. The AI is great and thugs will be less likely to attack you when you push one of their face's into a fan or smash someone against a telephone booth. This game is great at immersing you into every aspect of the game. In all, the combat is just as solid as the graphics and storyline. Other Notes+ The soundtrack fits the theme very well+ Traffic and NPC's are very realistic, a must for a game set in one of the biggest cities in the world- Driving feels a bit clunky+/- Little to no gun combat, which could be a plus or minus depending on how you feel+ Definitive Edition includes all DLC's+/- Okay optimization, got a stable 60 FPS on high @ 1920x1080 on an OEM GTX 760, which gets 4-5 frames per second lower than a normal 760. Quick pro tip here, running this game on the Extreme preset enabled will turn on high SSAA & FXAA, which will eat up your FPS without providing much visual difference. Best to use a custom preset and switch to high FXAA and medium SSAA. SummarySleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition lives up to it's claim of improved graphics and delivers a very enjoyable gaming experience, but the keyboard and mouse experience is not the best. I recommend a controller, and be weary that the Extreme graphic preset enables high super sampling anti-aliasing which will eat up FPS, I recommend using a custom setup and use medium SSAA and high FXAA if you have a mid-tier graphics card such as the 270X or 760. I would happily recommend this to anyone who has enjoyed games such as GTA, Assassin's Creed, Watch Dogs or any of the Batman games. It isn't the most recent title, but the definitive edition includes all the DLC's and the updated graphics are on par with 2014 releases. My overall rating for this game is a very sold 9/10.

												Sleeping Dogs: DE edition is why steam needs more review options than either yes/no -  Sleeping Dogs is a game that I would give a neutral review on,  the gameplay has varied amount of issues and bugs but also occasionally is great fun to play.  Sleeping Dogs is the epitome of take two steps forward and three steps backwards, hopefully SE will decide on making a sequel and address many of the issues that keep Sleeping Dogs from being a masterpiece. +Great Graphics+Great setting and story+Good fighting mechanics+Plenty of action sequences+Lots of side missions+Good voice actors-Poor racing missions, especially bike races-Questionable vehicle handling-Many bugs and occasional crashes-Poor gunplay-Frustrating missions-Useless weapons especially gunsThere are many questionable design flaws in Sleeping Dogs which really don't help the game, such as several highly useless abilities like access police weapons from the trunks of police cars, alls this does is immediately start a police chase, not that the guns will help you since they'll disappear if you interact with the world - yes, you heard that currently since SE constantly defend the fact that this is a melee based game, they state that guns are a 'power-up' but that doesn't explain why if I use a health shrine or open a box, or do anything other than shoot the gun will mysteriously disappear - this renders all the DLC that have bonus weapons completely useless. Hong Kong looks great - plenty of eye candy all around but even so, SE fails to go beyond that - the character customization is limited, clothing is limited with few giving XP or special boosts.   Car customization is non-existant which is a shame and doesn't really make that much sense since a large portion of content revolves around illegal street racing, which brings up another major issue - the racing is exceptionally poor, the car races are 100% based on picking the correct car for the race, its as simple as that - whilst the bike racing is mind blowing bad, your rival racers seem to ride ungodly powerful bikes that go significantly faster, have insanely perfect handling around tight spaces and have godly acceleration, the only chances the player has to win the bike races is to have the best bikes and to drive the race with perfection, no crashes, no drift errors - as your rivals will slow down at certain parts allowing you to get in front, and then catch just as quickly. In closing,  whilst I'm giving this a recommedation, this game does have its issues so I would rather give it a mixed review rather than a purely postive one.   I would say this game is worth a purchase if on sale or cheap but be aware of potential issues.			",573,171,24,105,82,4,89

												It seems like every other game these days is an open-world affair, and if you’re looking to explore an urban environment – cars, guns, and crime included – you might first think of such titles as Grand Theft Auto V or Watch Dogs. For the more adventurous, however, comes the rerelease of a 2012 hit; Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition sees the game with a whole host of tweaks and updates, plus the inclusion of DLC content. It’s a worthy contender in a strong genre, but unfortunately remains a long way from being graphically spectacular or particularly innovative.Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition will see you stepping into the shoes of Wei Shen, a police officer going undercover in the Sun On Yee triad. The story is an engrossing affair, a tale of loyalty, betrayal and duty set against the vibrant background of Hong Kong. Shen’s emotional turmoil is the real driving force behind the game, as he is promoted within the triad from foot soldier to “Red Pole”, or lieutenant, and struggles to walk the narrow line between crime and the law, committing terrible acts in order to maintain his cover, and all in the name of the greater good. It’s a story full of emotional highs and lows, with twists and turns aplenty to keep you interested. Perhaps the biggest character in the piece is not Shen, however, but Hong Kong itself. The city is visually fascinating, a warren of shady alleyways and broad highways, of clubs and skyscrapers and cluttered neon signs all battling for your attention. It’s a welcome change from the usual American cities where open-world games are set, and by game’s end you’ll be sad to be leaving it behind.There are plenty of vehicles you can use to traverse Hong Kong, including cars, motorbikes, vans and boats; you can even catch a taxi if you’re feeling particularly lazy. The missions are varied and largely good fun, and put Shen’s various abilities to good use. There’s a good amount of free-running and martial arts to be done, along with car chases, street racing and a fair bit of gunplay. Some missions are slower paced and show a playful side to the game; taking girls on dates, for example, can involve such silliness as taking photos at the park, singing karaoke, or even just driving a fast car really, really fast. A nice touch is how the gameplay mirrors the story. As the stakes become bigger, so too do the missions. The first few hours are largely given over to hand-to-hand combat and simple challenges, and it’s several hours in before Shen even picks up a gun. The bigger set pieces – gun battles in the streets, car chases which see Shen leaping from vehicle to vehicle – are saved for the important moments. This means the game never stays static, always building and growing and offering something new with each hour that goes by.The gameplay itself is remarkably intuitive. Inevitable comparisons to the Batman: Arkham games must be made when it comes to the combat, which is simple but has a great deal of depth. There’s a button for attacking, a button for grappling, and a button for countering enemy strikes; using the three in combination showcases Shen’s martial arts skills with some serious aplomb. You can also perform environmental attacks, such as slamming people into phone booths or impaling them (yes, this one’s true) on a pile of swordfish heads. It’s a system which works well but never becomes so convoluted that you’ll press the wrong button at a crucial moment. The rest of the gameplay follows suit. Free-running involves simply holding the run button down and then tapping it when you come to an obstacle. Using guns is much the same as any third-person shooter, with a simple cover system and an array of weapons including machine guns and grenade launchers. Driving vehicles is well balanced; each one has a distinct feel, but they are largely easy to control and you won’t find yourself careering off course for no apparent reason.You can also develop Shen’s abilities over time. You earn two types of experience for each mission based on your performance; one is “Cop” experience and the other is “Triad”. These can be put towards unlocking new skills in their respective trees, and you can also add new moves to Shen’s repertoire at a martial arts school if you find the requisite items. There is also something called “Face” experience, which is gained by helping people around the city and lets you obtain new clothes and cars. Some of the missions to improve this can seem trivial – delivering someone’s lunch, for example, seems a strange task for a triad lieutenant – but do help to add yet more variety to the game.Largely speaking, Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is an excellent effort. It weaves a fascinating narrative and it’s fun to play, with a good amount of content to sink your teeth into. The main story takes a good fifteen to twenty hours to complete, and there are side missions galore on top of it. What problems there are tend to be exceedingly minor. Some of the character animations are stiff and unrealistic, but with a voice cast including talents such as Tom Wilkinson, Emma Stone and Lucy Liu, you won’t much notice. Occasionally a car will appear from nowhere, necessitating evasive action (or else a spectacular high-speed crash) but this only happened once or twice while I was playing.The biggest problem with Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is that it simply doesn’t feel like a game for the new generation of consoles. Despite all its many tweaks and improvements over the original, it doesn’t feel like they’ve made a great deal of difference. When The Last of Us was ported to PlayStation 4 it looked like it belonged there, but Sleeping Dogs doesn’t achieve the same feat. Graphically, it looks like a PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 game. The gameplay may be better balanced but unless you’ve played the original this simply won’t make an impact on you. Furthermore, for those who did play the original there doesn’t seem much point in upgrading. The major DLCs which come packaged with the Definitive Edition aren’t particularly long and aren’t as engrossing as the main game. The best is probably Nightmare at North Point, which breaks canon to pit Shen against ghostly gangster Smiley Cat and his army of the undead. Hong Kong takes on a dark, supernatural feel and the plot displays a wicked sense of humour, but there isn’t a great deal of variety to it and it only takes a couple of hours to complete. The other major DLC, Year of the Snake, is similar in length but extremely short on story; it offers only a threadbare reason to carry out a few new missions and extend your time in Hong Kong. Much of the other DLC is additional content – extra outfits, weapons and vehicles – which you won’t even notice in the main game.If you missed it the first time around, Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is well worth picking up. It plays beautifully, has a great story, and will introduce you to a world you never knew you wanted to explore. There’s also no doubting that it’s better than the original release. It has been improved in many ways; the graphics, presentation and gameplay have been tweaked and there is some additional content, even if not a great deal. It’s a superb game, but not one worth upgrading your hardware for. Highly Recommended ",1490,577,44,240,153,14,217

SD normal edition is great because of optimization and CF/SLI support. this edition don't seem to go above 30 fps no matter what settings you use. and is not CF/SLI friendly like the normal edition. i understand that better graphics means more requirments, but should still get over 30fps. the DLC is all now part of the game it's self. you now have to open everything up by doing all the missions.  so it's not directly added to your inventory. you also have to purchase it from a NPC in the game and alot of the stuff is priced at insane prices like 350,000+ for a single outfit from the DLC that you gust get in the normal version.IMO this is an ""OK"" version. but i don't recommend it, if you can get the original with all the DLC. i know steam no longer sells it. but you can buy the original through ♥♥♥ or another reseller for steam games.normal edition 10/10definitive edition 6/10			",603,182,45,69,92,9,96

												The moment I walked into the bright and vibrant city streets of Hong Kong, I knew this game would blow my mind. Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition is a unique open-world action videogame with crime as its main topic. In Sleeping Dogs you play as Wei Shen, a american-asian undercover police detective tasked to infilitrate into the Sun On Yee, one of the five triads in the  city. The game's graphics are brilliant for it's age, and I must say the developers have worked hard to polish it up for the definitive edition. The storyline is as great as always, with memorable characters and exceptional dialogue, all laced with brief chinese and cantonese words to make the enviorment feel more like a living, breathing Hong Kong city. The gameplay mechanics mainly focus on combat, and unlike the Arkham series developed by Rocksteady, this game's combat mechanics centers on counter-attacks. With both brilliant and brutal enviormental kills such as slamming a person into a rooftop fanblade and impaling enemies onto bamboo shoots, the combat is both lively, exhilerating and amazing. The storyline is lengthy and is not repetitive, unlike recent videogames such as Mafia 3. The missions are fun, the storyline is brilliant told and filled with fun, comedic jokes along the way. This game is much more than a 'GTA-Clone', it is open-world games taken to a whole new level. Most open-world games take place in the west, this was the first game that changed that. The change in enviorment and the interactivity of the world around you makes this game a memorable, beautiful, unique, awesome and brilliant masterpiece.This was the best open-world game I've played of all time, buying it at the full price is definitely worth it.

												This game is, quite frankly, amazing. I've only spent a small amount of time with it, but I've completed the story. It's the only game that makes me compare other games to it and feel disatisifed with the other games. STORYThe game's story puts you as Wei, a cop. I found the story quite fun, as it makes you laugh and cheer on some of the characters at certain points (looking at you, grandma!) and some people might not like it due to it's cliche nature. However, don't go thinking about the story too critically; you will be slightly dissapointed. The story makes you feel for the characters, and wanting to go against the characters in the story; which, I believe, is the purpose. It isn't the best story ever, but I love it due to it's nature. Highly subjective!GAMEPLAYAh, the most important part to lots of people. The gameplay is incredibly fun! Lots of high action, slow mo moves to make you really feel like Wei, and not some generic character. The system reminds me of the Arkham series, but I prefer this system by miles. The gunplay is alright, not great, but I love how the pistols feel. I think this matters because it is reminiscent of gang violence, which is what the game is based around. The general style of the combat made me play Sleeping Dog's MMO, which is called Triad Wars, but don't try it. Seriously. Waste. Of. Time.GRAPHICSThe graphics are fine, not too good, not too bad. The only annoyance is the low view distance, which is covered by a Depth-of-Field like fog. I wish you could turn it off. Other than that, the graphics are fine and make you feel immersed.Nice viarety of graphics options, lacking an FoV slider but that isn't too necessary. REPLAYABILITYNow, this is where my hours come into account. Notice the low amount; I believe that it has little to no replayability, and that is why I wanted the MMO to succeed. Sure, if you like collecting things, you'll have a great time completing this one, but if you're like me, and just 'play' games, you won't particularly like this one. OVERALLGreat game, nice graphics, amazing combat, fantastic story, but no replayability. BUT, I won't let this one itch stop me. I love this game, and it's easily one of the best games I've ever played. It's a 10/10. Have fun!			",158,20,8,16,8,2,12

												This is a martial arts game that is fun. The story line is quite good and the graphics are great when they are maxed out. The additional DLC brings some extra gameplay time which is nice an some new vehicles which are fun to use. The combat system is similar to Assassin's Creed and the batman games but it is still fluid and good to use. If you buy this game on sale or cheap then it is definitely worth it :)			",559,133,27,50,58,15,66

												Personally I've found this game more fun than GTA V, not as an entire game against another, but as the single player experience. If you're looking for a more single player oriented GTA open world style game, then I would highly suggest you give this a try. If you play GTA games(GTA V Specifically) for the co-op/online experience, then you may want to save your money for GTA V when it comes out.With that said, I absolutely loved the game and was way better than I have expected. The story will keep you wanting to know what happens next so prepare yourself for that if you do decide to pick this game up.			",82,7,1,17,1,0,6

												Amazing game.It is a ""would be"" True Crime game. For comparison, other games in this series are very mediocre. Not Sleeping Dogs, though. This one could easily go toe to toe with the big fish like GTA.Also sports the best car in a game I've seen. A crossover of the Knight Rider and a James Bond car.The cons are negligible. The camera spazzes out occasionally, especially when performing Action Hijacks. The GPS can be a load of crap sometimes. In addition, money isn't a problem at all, unless you go for a completionist playthrough and want to buy all the cars and clothes. The main story DLCs are great, but very short (from around 40 minutes to 3 hours to complete). Also, they are significantly less serious in tone compared to the base game, which might be a drawback for some people.That's all the cons I could think of.			",188,13,0,16,3,1,18

It is definitely worth its price. The gameplay will make you feel like a badass from an 80's action film, and the story will keep you engrossed until you finish it. Whether you're leaping from car to car on a freeway or beating up everyone in a fight club, Sleeping Dogs will be a fun experience.			",80,4,0,14,7,0,5

												The moment I walked into the bright and vibrant city streets of Hong Kong, I knew this game would blow my mind. Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition is a unique open-world action videogame with crime as its main topic. In Sleeping Dogs you play as Wei Shen, a american-asian undercover police detective tasked to infilitrate into the Sun On Yee, one of the five triads in the  city. The game's graphics are brilliant for it's age, and I must say the developers have worked hard to polish it up for the definitive edition. The storyline is as great as always, with memorable characters and exceptional dialogue, all laced with brief chinese and cantonese words to make the enviorment feel more like a living, breathing Hong Kong city. The gameplay mechanics mainly focus on combat, and unlike the Arkham series developed by Rocksteady, this game's combat mechanics centers on counter-attacks. With both brilliant and brutal enviormental kills such as slamming a person into a rooftop fanblade and impaling enemies onto bamboo shoots, the combat is both lively, exhilerating and amazing. The storyline is lengthy and is not repetitive, unlike recent videogames such as Mafia 3. The missions are fun, the storyline is brilliant told and filled with fun, comedic jokes along the way. This game is much more than a 'GTA-Clone', it is open-world games taken to a whole new level. Most open-world games take place in the west, this was the first game that changed that. The change in enviorment and the interactivity of the world around you makes this game a memorable, beautiful, unique, awesome and brilliant masterpiece.This was the best open-world game I've played of all time, buying it at the full price is definitely worth it.

												Sleeping Dogs: Definitive edition is almost a straight-upgrade to the original, Of which I had on my Xbox 360, Loved it to pieces and then when I heard about this, and in the 2 year time period of the games coming out got a gaming PC, I knew I had to get it on the PC. It has amazing parkour mechanics, With smooth yet realistic mechanics, The slow-motion is possibly the best around and dont get me started on the figthing mechanics... Maghad. The fighting mechanics are possibly the best I have seen in years. GTA's fighting mechanics are... Okay, But compared to Sleeping Dogs', GTA is on its hands and feet. Its a mass of fun to play, WIth vastly updated mechanics and content, And when you buy the game, You get all 24 DLC's included with it. The graphics have been updated, But not that much tbh. Cant get much better than that, Right?Pro's- Amazing parkour mechanics- Brilliant sound effects- updated graphics- Absoloutely brilliant fighting and shooting mechanics- The slow-motion... :DCon's- No modding compatability as of UK: 10/12/14 US: 12/10/14 GDArcan said that there ""won’t be any mod tools"" ;'(- Graphics haven't been vastly upgraded.OVERALL:9/10Would definately recommend.

												One of the few open world games I finished.Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is well worth the purchase.The main character, Wei Shen, is an undercover cop who returns to Hong Kong to help infiltrate the Sun On Yee Triad organization. As Wei continues proving himself loyal to the Triads, he gets stuck in war between triad factions while remaining undercover and reporting to his superiors, blurring the lines between him being a cop and being a Triad member.Positives:- Combat system: Consists of striking, grappling, and counters. These can be chained into combos and other cool moves as you unlock more of Wei's abilities.- The city: It isn't an exact replica of Hong Kong. But having been there a few times, I can say that the game captures the spirit of Hong Kong beautifully.- Characters: Really intruiging as you go deeper into the story.- Driving: Probably one the best driving experience i had in open world games- Tons of clothes.- The Zodiac tournament: A Really cool homage to Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon.Negatives:- Minor sound bug: On a mission requiring you to shoot a machine gun while on a car, a constant machine gun sound will start and won't stop. This can be fixed multiples ways: by quitting the game and reloading the file, by restarting your PC, Remove the save file and put it back again.- Too much English. Wish the characters spoke more Cantonese since the game is set in Hong Kong.- No matter how much heat you have, the cops stop chasing you once you enter your apartment.Score: 8.5 / 10			",21,1,2,7,6,2,4

												Do you like Hong Kong action flicks from the 90's to early 00's? Do you like Asian metropolis' with its colourful citizens? This game is for you, then.There are two things that seperate this game from the rest of the open world, modern day genres:1. Its Kung Fu combat system.2. Its RPG elements that allow you to improve your character.I enjoyed this game on the Xbox 360 and I purchased it on a whim on Steam when I saw it included all the DLC. I find that every generation of consoles, there is an Asian-style fighting game that takes place in Hong Kong. In 2003, we had Jet Li's Rise to Honour. In 2013, we have Sleeping Dogs. What does 2023 hold for us? Only time will tell.Anyways, get it when it's on sale. The physics and gameplay isn't as realistic or fleshed out as GTA V, but the game itself and the flavour is worth it.			",212,20,4,29,36,0,26

												I bought this game while it was on sale, and when I first started playing it, I disliked the graphics and gameplay. The fighting was confusing, and I was comparing it to GTA5. However, I made a huge HUGE mistake.This quickly became one of my favourite games.Lets get the cons over with: The lighting and environment is slightly dull, and there are some weird vehicle glitchesPROS:The fighting style is amazing, easy to learn and cool af once you master it. It has a proper learning curve, and increases in challenge. There is no ultimate kill-mode you attain at the end, you simply climb the learning curve sucessfullyThe car races are fun with a capital F. You are allowed to bash, crash and slam the other opponents. The vehicle controls are easy to master and the variety of cars are fun. The hijack system is fun to screw around with as well!The storyline, although it didn't impress me significantly, it was short and sweet, and it was fun achieving the 'police' and 'triad' xp, as well as leveling up and achieving milestones (disarms, headshots, etc)All in all, I went and got a 100% clear on the game, dlcs and all. I would recommend picking this up for a cool jackie chan/bruce lee version of gta.			",204,74,2,15,18,4,19

												If you've already got Sleeping Dogs, I don't know if getting the DE is strictly necessary. But I bought it anyway just to see what the differences were (which seem to be that you get all the DLC integrated and there's some cosmetic improvements).Nevertheless, I ended up playing through the whole thing again. It really is one of the best open world games released in the last while, so if you DON'T have it and you like this sort of thing, umm, why don't you have it yet? To recap, the characterisation is superb, the gameplay is very good - the melee combat is particularly satisfying, as you would want a game with an particular emphasis on the martial arts to be. No doubt there is the usual disjoint between the plot and the open-world stuff in that you play an undercover cop who does a very convincing job of not giving two hoots about the law. The tone varies accordingly so it gets quite dark, with the odd lighter moment, but is never goofy.Also, swordfish.			",143,38,10,20,58,0,31

												One of the best games I've recently played. I played about an hour of the original, so I don't know how well this compares to the other, but man is this game fun.Combat is very fluid and very tight. It feels a little bit like the Arkham games, but in it's own way. You mash left click to punch and depending on a certain way you press it, it does a special move, and you have to press right click to counterattack an enemy. There are guns in this game, but I find that most of the time you won't be needing them, only on missions where the enemies have their own guns. The shooting is pretty much like any other third person shooter, nothing special but it works nicely.Driving is alright in this game. It's not as good as GTA V, but it's passable. I like the ability to jump off your motorcycle and onto another car, it's really cool. I also like that you can press Shift to ram into other vehicles and drive them off road. There's lots of cars in the game too, and you can buy a bunch of them and keep them forever. I'm not sure if you're allowed to put a stolen vehicle into your parking garage.The game takes place in Hong Kong and boy it's beautiful. Driving down the alley way you can see all the wires hanging from the tall apartment building, the roads are littered with bright neon lights, and there are tons of people too. One new improvement from the original is that there are more people on screen at one time and it's actually pretty impressive. Walking down the Night Market at night (lol) is impressive because that's when everyone comes out. There are huge crowds of people, and it's fun to stalk them and listen in on their conversation. It's neat because it's kinda rare to hear the same conversation repeated in a short period of time. There are always new things that the people are talking about.The sounds in this game are pretty decent. Cars sound loud, punching people has a satisfying thump to it, and the voice acting is great. One of the best things about the sound is the original soundtrack. It's like a mixture of classic Chinese music and hip-hop beats, as if Wu-Tang made their beats with an orchestra. I catch myself sitting at the main menu for a few minutes listening to the wonderful music.The graphics are pleasing as well. You won't find graphics as good as Arma 3 or Battlefield 4 here, but it's better than most other recent games (looking at you, SR4). There are a good ammount of graphics options available. Also, there is another HD texture pack that you can install onto the game.Included with the Definitive Edition is all the past DLC from the original game. There are two expanision packs included, and to my knowledge they are pretty long themselves. The other DLC is mostly cars, clothing, weapons, that sort of thing. What it all comes down to really is if it's fun or not, and it most definitely is. The combat is fun, takes skill and is very satisfying, the driving is neat, and the story is good enough to get you hooked on thinking whats gonna happen next. Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition gets a 8/10. ",291,48,5,36,29,1,21

												Wei's story will resonate with anyone who grew up in two cultures or is Asian-American. You will go through what pulls him in two directions as he struggles to find his place culturally. If HBO, did a miniseries about a cop infiltrating the mafia in Asia, it would be Sleeping dogs.Compared to GTA:- Better fighting. Like infinitely better- Better environment/immersion. Looks like Asia/HK even down to stuff like the air conditioner and bongo trucks.- Better RPG. You can customize your abilities towards cop / triad.- Better car management. You can get a car from any parking garage.- Better side missions. There's racing like GTA, but also fight club. Also, your side missions not only give you money but also mafia XP or police XP.- Worse driving, but only slightly- Gunplay is different. You throw away a gun after running out of ammo. You cannot store your gun (only if you have DLC that includes guns with your outfits). But gunplay isn't important to the story since it's fighting based. ",326,86,5,26,30,5,28

												It has an amazing storyline with great voice acting and character development. It is one of my favourite games due to the many different characters that you meet and the plot twists that happen as you progress through the game.I'd have to give it a 9/10			",81,5,0,9,5,0,5

												So in this game you play as an immoral wank*r (Triad Member) who is actually a professional wank*r (Police Officer) in a city once ruled by imperial wank*rs (Hong Kong). Yup... and you can be sure that my psycho-side was in full force when I played this. I just couldn't help myself. XDIt's basically a sandbox crime game, but with the added twist of you sometimes doing sandbox stuff where you punch crime instead. Or taze it. Or shoot it. Or arrest it. Or... yeah not continuing this. Anyway, there's lots of side missions, collectibles, places to explore, minigames, and citizens to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of when they make rude remarks about your clothes, hit you with their car, or just simply exist. Honestly, I didn't need reasons to act like a total sociopath (even moreso than I do in the Saints Row games, which is really saying something), so I had a tendency to act like one......except during alot of missions when it actually has negative effects. Basically you have three leveling systems: Police (which you get xp for by obeying the law and punching criminals on police missions), Triad (for punching people or slamming their head into... woah that was uncalled for), and Face (for helping people, which I find funny since pride pretty much never involves being a benefactor). It's pretty obvious which of these three leveling systems I didn't get much XP for. The minigames were kinda silly, particularly that karaoke stuff and the whole collecting girl phone numbers thing (which I never called because I never got that bored). At least the combat is pretty good.There is a story, and it's actually pretty good. At times predictable, and I often felt as if my main character was being way too antagonistic towards his police handler. But it's good. Also its crazy-violent, because gangsters who talk about codes and honor are the last people to actually respect such things. And while I was not torn at all about whose side I was on (because Triad people are scum), I did cheer a few times when they did stuff I wanted them to do, such as when the character I hated the most (because he pulled a Walder Frey, which made me think about the ""RW"" and all that comes with that) ended up being killed by a crazed lady feeding him one of his henchmen and chopping him with a meat cleaver. And while that was certainly satisfying, it wasn't one of the many ideas I had between the ""Hong Kong RW"" and that scene about what way I would have ended that guy (or Walder Frey). I had an alarming tendency to ponder what outrageous act of violence I wanted to see end the lives of certain characters, most of which were more brutal than what actually happened. I really must be a psycho. >_<Anyway... sandbox crime, violence, betrayal... all that horse-♥♥♥♥. There isn't really anything new here, and while I certainly prefer other games (like the Saints Row series) for this type of fun, this is alright. So I guess that's a ""yes"" from me.Yey.

												SUMARRY: This game is very very fun! I really like the story and the setting, if GTA was set in Hong Kong basically. The story is all about underground crime and I really love that in games, shows you how much ♥♥♥♥ can be going in behind the scenes that you dont know about. This game is very much focused on hand to hand combat but not button mashing. And the graphics are very nice.PROS:-Combat is fantastic-Parkour system flows well-Great story-Great character progression-Use the environment in combat which is fantastic-Great music and soundtrack and i'm not a soundtrack personCONS:-Cant customize cars :(CONCLUSION:If you like underground crime stories and enjoyed GTA, you will enjoy this game, buy it! And heres a sneak peak of how good the graphics can look******STORY SPOILER*********

												Great game, it is basically GTA in Hong Kong. Graphics are great, especially when it is raining. The story is well written, an undercover cop goes back to his roots in Hong Kong and gets involved in the triad war. Sounds cliche but is very interesting! Game is full of a lot to do and is definitely an underrated game, game took about 16 hours for me to complete and was worth every penny			",200,14,4,16,5,1,8

												Cool game, lovely voice work and great graphics. The environments are nice and the combat is fun. However there is one thing that I cannot shake when I play this and it is very irritating. It feels like a poor man's GTA. Driving vehicles is no fun either, mostly because when using a mouse and keyboard, the camera is awkward. Reversing on a bike will spin the camera, but if you manually move the mouse to get a better look as you set off forward, it will still rotate the camera and as such go beyond the forward view - as if it has to complete the entire motion. Why they couldn't of made it so moving the camera view yourself resets the camera spin, I just don't know.There are are a few other minor annoyances. Sometimes AI will walk into things, which isn't that bad really and many games are guilty of that (ahem Payday 2), but one of my biggest gripes when playing on foot is that there is no toggle for walk and run. Instead, if you want to walk you must rely on holding the free aim button (which is right click by default). However using free aim to walk is evidently not the proper way of doing it because whenever you get near an interactable object that you wish to talk past, your guy will just... sort of strafe past it while trying to get it in focus. Bit daft really that they couldn't simply add a walk toggle button.Another annoyance? The weird buttons. The game plays brilliantly with mouse and keyboard, but I have no idea why some menus rely solely on pressing Left-CTRL and Right-CTRL and Backspace and Enter. Why couldn't a cursor be implemented? Seems a bit lazy if you ask me.Overall, of what I've played (among some other very minor bugs which I've decided not to mention here), the game is excellent and well worth the money if you haven't already got the base game. For those who have the original Sleeping Dogs, I wouldn't necessarily say the increase in graphical fidelity and draw distance was worth it... although that is ultimately your decision.

Soon,the region-restricted money-grabber will be(has been) deleted in my list as I asked for the regional discrimination,not before I played it enough to have right to post this.Good job,publisher,you've allured us by using the obsession.I wrote this review for the original edition owners.Sleeping Dogs+HD Pack+rest of the DLCs＞Sleeping Dogs:Definitive EditionIt is too similar to the original in graphic,mechanics and glitches.You should note that there is a DLC called ""High Resolution Texture Pack"",with which,the original version can be run in better graphics.And the so-called ""Definitive Edition"" seems to be improved limitedly.It's not too long time since the original edition released in 2012 and the graphics of the original game hasn't been dated enough to require that ""redux"".Some content lacked,compared to the original Sleeping Dogs:Brawling gloveHigh Roller outfitAn Ikoze sport watch(I opened all lockboxes and left only this item still locked in the entire list,seems like a glitch.)Maybe some other things.SE just want to sell the ONE product again.Why not?Low budget for production and merely adding some little enhancement and copy-paste work for the obsession sufferers to add a ""new"" game in their lists?A ""wise"" idea.Though I bought this game twice and unlocked all the achievement and completed the badly designed in-game stat challenges twice like an autosadist(one of the Ikoze Sport Watches still lacked,it seems like a bug.).I have posted the review for the high texture DLC as below:If you consider buying a game published by SE,like Sleeping Dogs,Tomb Raider and Deus Ex,stay calm and hold back your money,just wait for the ""GOTY Edition"",""Director's Edition"" or some other ""FREAKING AWESOME Editions"".

												Absolutely one of the most under-appreciated games ever made, hands down probably my favorite open-world game. I'd say it's a Chinese-American version of Yakuza, but less people know about that than this probably.Pros:-Combat: The hand-to-hand combat is fantastic, it's a slightly more complex ""Arkham style"", with counters, grabs, and actual button combos, which lead to visceral fist fights, ending in the always enjoyable slow-motion knockout/kill. This is probably what sells the game for me, it's just so much fun getting in huge fights that range from fists, to melee weapons, to all-out gun fights.-Story: Playing an undercover cop in a Triad gang is a great start, as we watch the main character grapple with needing to enforce the law, but also being in a gang that he comes to respect/love. Spoilers aside, it's pretty great. The voice-acting is fantastic as well, with enough actual Mandarin that it doesn't feel like Disney Presents: Sleeping Dogs.-Driving: Some people aren't a huge fan of the car physics in the game, which I can respect, but I love it. It feels rather Arcade-y, with hairpin handbrake turning, and the ability to jump from your car to others, it's just a blast to drive around causing havoc. It's true, sometimes I felt cheated by getting caught on something only to spin out and get stuck, but that's a rare occurrence.-Customization: There are tons of outfits for your character, which actually changes how you play, with some getting bonus XP, and others giving you increased gun accuracy or melee strength. You can't change his hair or anything like that, but watching him enter a scene dressed like a '90s rocker is always fun.-Length: There is plenty to do, my first playthrough on the PS3 got me about 20-25 hours of messing around and plot, and now this version has even more added content, with new missions and side-activities, it's definitely not a game to speedrun.Cons:-Guns: I did say I enjoy the gun fights, but it's hardly a terrible thing they're not too frequent. You never feel very accurate when shooting, and will most likely miss more than you hit, especially in the driving sections that ask you to protect the car. They're far from game-breaking, but you can really tell they focused on the fisticuffs and threw in guns afterwards.-Level Up System: One of the cruxes of the game, is how you level up. There are 2 level up paths; Triad and Cop. Each mission will award XP to both in a ""star-sytem"", that is, maximum XP is 3 stars, and minimum is no stars. When you start a mission, cop XP starts at 3 full stars, but when you mess up you lose from that potential reward pool, by either hurting innocents, or driving like a maniac. Triad XP is earned  by fighting and general killing, and builds from 0 stars. What you have to do is try and be as bad aas possible, while still being good. Interesting on paper, but in reality it's rather annoying. It is so much easier to get cop XP that you may be fully leveled on Cop, and on level 5 of Triad. While also not game-breaking, it just feels unbalanced.World Size: It says it's open-world, but in reality it's about 3 or 4 small cities attached by roads, circling a large empty area. It looks far larger than it really is, and seems rather deceiving.Other than that I can't think of anything right now, it's a hell of a game, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a new twist on an old genre. It's fun to play, easy to get into, and will swallow your time if you give it the chance.			",247,38,2,32,10,1,24

												Good story line so far, amazing graphics!! Great selection of outfits. I love the mini tasks like hacking security cameras. Although combat move commands are quite complex to perform and remember, pretty nice gameplay. Though, what I dislike about it is that if I exit the game in the middle of a mission (that is already a checkpoint) and then return, I will appear in my safehouse instead of the place where my last progress is & the mission will restart and all the progress in between is lost.

												Great Game with a great story line!My opinions regarding the game:You have to remember that you are in Hong Kong and they do drive on the left. Especially when you are not used to have cars go on the left but on the right in real life. How many times have I crossed the road to be plowed from behind? A mystery because I lost count after 100+.I understand there are so many insurance frauds in the real world, but driving on the road and the car in front slams the brakes a great majority of the time for no reason gets frustrating.The driving game camera could be better controlled especially when you need to reverse fast and move forward. The camera view becomes a real pain when it whips around when you get stuck with the car.Should have a setting to select the radio station you wished to be default for your game or another option is to be able to add your own music folder as a radio station like GTA would be awesome.A fast way to make a lot of money in the game, is to use ""Tran"" car mini-quests from the cellphone. Can make a great deal of money in a short time, of course depended on the cars you obtain until completed all the requests. A few other odd little annoyances like in all other games and that is it, it’s just a game but great game.A trick for achieving the Social Hub “Gambler”:If you go into “Statistics”, then “Completion”, it will show you the “Overall net gambling performance”. The stat tracker in the Social Hub will only take into account the highest of your overall performance has ever been and not what it is currently. The one in Social Hub will never go lower if you go on a losing streak, so you have to look into the “Statistics”, then “Completion”, will show you the “Overall net gambling performance” to find out.This is why it isn't increasing in the Social Hub section. In “Statistics”, I was at -$24 500 for my Overall net performance, even though in Social Hub was stating that I had maximum of $215 000.Follow the tips found online on so many sites in regards of achieving this by saving the game on wins and reload when you lose. Took about 30 minutes to accomplish this by reloading when was at North Point, walk until can grab a taxi to the vehicle store at the dock in Kennedy; steal the car behind when out of the taxi to drive the remaining section to the Kennedy ^Rooster fight. Still a great game to play and challenging to try to obtain all the achievements!P.S. the *Rooster was supposed to be written KCOC <- written backwards, but it gets censored!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sleeping Dogs is a solid, but sorta clunky, game. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes action/open world games.    First off, I would recommend playing with a controller for this game. The keyboard controls aren't TERRIBLE, but you will be finding yourself fustrated in some fighting/driving sections in the game. Nevertheless, Sleeping Dogs has a fun combat system, similar to the Batman Arkham games. It is smooth and you will be finding yourself just going around Hong Kong beating up baddies.    Hong Kong is spectacular to look at (especially at night). Overall, it is a good looking game. Character models look good and all characters in the game are well voice acted. The characters in Sleeping Dogs are detailed and Wei Shen is a likeable main character along with the other supporting characters in the game.     Hong Kong feels alive, wherever you go it will feel like you are in an actual city that you will be able to explore. Sleeping Dogs also has quite a few side activities including: races, fight clubs, karaoke (yes, karaoke), side challenges, betting on chicken fights and more.      There are quite a few things to collect around Hong Kong. There is actual importance in these collectibles, like to learn to fighting moves or increase your maximum health.     Sleeping Dogs has some issues that shine a little too many times throughout this game. The game is sometimes too easy. In shooter sections, it is just too easy, the AI just isn't smart enough to make you get a game over screen in these sections. And although there is quite a bit of side mission in this game, they kinda get repettitive. Some quests often have you do very similar activities here and there. And this game can be fustratingly buggy. Just be prepared when the game just decides to do a total U-turn on you in some sections like action hijacking a big vehicle for example.      With all of that said, Sleeping Dogs is a decently solid game. I was actually amazed by how much fun I was having when I first played this game. But I recommend Sleeping Dogs to anyone that is looking for an action/ open world game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The developers definitely did a lot of research into Hong Kong and Chinese culture and behaviors. Even if you aren't Chinese, you're sure to get 90% of the full experience. You won't be able to understand a few things, but the pure gameplay and storyline will be more than enough to sate you.			",219,23,6,28,13,1,6

												A fun ride in the Streets of Hong Kong. The Story unfolds like a classic Hong Kong Martial Arts/Police Drama. While the Gameplay may not be as refined as some if its counterparts it is still fun and well worth the money, especially when it is reduced price.To run it on Windows 10 I had to create a Windows 8 Compatibility shortcut and disable Touch Keyboard and Handwriting panel Service.

												If you think Sleeping Dogs is just an asian GTA you would be right except that it is fantastic.  Playing as an undercover cop and having to balance your crime with your law enforcement just makes things infinatly better.			",157,40,2,39,22,0,25

												If you enjoy Hong Kong action films, you'll love this game!Let me preface this by saying that I'm usually not a big fan of GTA-style games.  What usually happens is that I spend the first hour trying to adapt to the funky console-ported controls and views, then get sidetracked on several repetitive missions, before finally getting stuck on an crucial plot-related mission and quitting in frustration.  But this game is just GOOD!  First, the Sleeping Dogs world is immersive and believable.  You are constantly reminded that the story takes place in Hong Kong, beginning with the left-hand driving, to the street signs, language immersion (Cantonese), and the cultural cues (like Asian Pop).   The music is great and the action is fun.  Unlike the US, guns are illegal in Hong Kong and gun-violence is rare.  Most, but not all, of the action involves martial arts (generally button combos) and vehicle chases.Give this game a try!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was the most enjoyable experience I have ever had while playing a game. Everything about this game was SO prefect that I played it 2 days straight just to complete the story.

												This game is exactly the same as the original just with a HD pack & lots of graphic fixes, lens focus and attention to detail. Not forgetting also additional expansion DLCs built into the game & online score keeping so you can compare your outcomes against friends.I'm not going into the details of the storyline because if you've played the original you should know what it's about if not then you'll experience the best Hong-Kong Triad themed game played in the 3rd Person view (similar to GTA & Saint's Row).Graphics: 8/10Sound: 8/10Music: 7/10Level Design: 8/10Re-play Value: 8/10Total score: 7.8/10 ",428,40,11,18,24,3,25

												If you're a fan of the Grand Theft Auto games you'll like this although it places a huge emphasis on martial arts melee combat with a minimal amount of gunplay so take that into account.I loved the story, who doesn't enjoy an undercover cop trying to infiltrate the chinese Triad who starts to get attached to the people he's supposed to investigate while trying to do his duty. Wei Shen's inner conflict and moral decisions are clearly depicted throughout the game and the story could easily stand tall with any AAA Hollywood movie of the same genre, in large part due to its excellent voice acting.The gameplay itself is well done and enjoyable, with excellent kung fu moves to unlock as well as other character bonuses that you open up through a smart upgrade system that intergrates itself beautifully into the game. A bevy of diverse and entertaining side missions further complement the game, enabling you to stretch your gametime into dozens of hours if you're so inclined, especially if you take into account the multitude of collectibles that reward you with cool & interesting outfits, health upgrades and vehicles - I'm always more motivated to get all collectibles if they actually give you something in return, so it's nice to see that here.I also did not encounter a single bug throughout my 40+ hours of playtime, which is awesome.On a seperate note I'd skip the DLCs if you can, especially ""Year of the Snake"" as I found it to be so boring that I didn't manage to finish it. ""Nightmare in North Point"" however is a lot more fun, more so if you're into vampires (like I am) as we get to go up against Jiang Shi, China's version of vampires. One thing that kind of drove me crazy in the DLCs however is that you don't have full access to the martial arts moves from the campaign whether by design or possible bugs that never got fixed. Regardless of the reason I found this to be frustrating when coupled with the fact that the mini-map doesn't display selected driving routes as it does in the campaign so you're forced to consult the full-screen map quite often.

Runs at 60+ FPS without much trouble on my machine.Overall good port but the PC controls are a bit cumbersome. I'd recommend using an Xbox 360 controller (or a DS3 with XInput) if you have one.

												Excellent game with a good story line, nice graphics, enough collectables and side quests to keep you going for a while. Nice fighting mechanics (although some of the moves can seem a little hard to pull off when surrounded by 20 bad guys). Throwing a bad guy onto a pallet of swordfish heads, pork buns, massage parlours (of both types ;-)) doggy DVD sellers, learn swearing in another language, nice mix of music to choose in cars, hot girls.The not so good aspects, after a while the melee loses its appeal and I resorted to cheap run them over with a car just to avoid a long drawn out fist fight. Pork buns (not a whole man), doggy DVD sellers, and hot girls you can’t get down a dirty with.Overall, a brilliant game with loads of movie clichés and fun action with a nice decent feel, it’s as if your almost in Hong Kong trying to bring down an underworld organisation as an undercover cop, well worth price especially on sale. I give it thumbs up! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just buy it - it's awesome. It's basically GTA and Batman squooshed together, with a sprinkling of Assassin's Creed thrown in for good measure. One of the best games I've ever played and the first I've 100%'ed on the pc since switching from console peasant.05.08.15. I'm sorry, I have to add to this. I was in a bit of a rush when I wrote the original review and didn't do this title justice at all. So, in order to try to redress the balance:I had this game for absolutely ages on the xbox360 and never got around to playing it, it came up for sale on steam and I thought 'Why not?'. I started playing this after finishing the game I was into at the time and O. M. G. - the first mission was kind of yeah, yeah, been here, seen it, done it on countless other games, with the only difference being the setting, but then - wham! the game just sort of opened up (as they do, I hear you say) but it sort of blew my mind.In essence, as I said at the start, it's pretty much GTA:Hong Kong in style, what with all the different things you can do outside of story missions, with parkour thrown in for free. BUT and it is a big but! - Sleeping Dogs is more like Red Dead Redemption in the way that it takes a well known tried and tested formula and puts it in a setting that makes it seem VERY different and the impact that this has on you, the player. Little touches in the game, (random overheard conversations, or people's doorsteps for example) made it seem so much like the real Hong Kong (although slightly squashed and far less crowded) that anyone could go to HK and not feel completey alienated. (The only things that's missing is the smell!). This game really made me feel like I was living the lifestyle of a chinese gangster (not so much the undercover cop, but I did have pangs of guilt whenever pedestrians got hurt and felt obliged to rescue handbags when the occasion presented itself!).Pros: beautifully recreated in superb graphics (very pretty game), grittyand slightly more realistic feelings for the character than most games of this ilk, cool parkour activity, captures the essence of a chinese/british culture almost perfectly, good variety of missions which meant you hardly ever had to do the same thing twice in a row, excellent balance of fighting and gunplay. Cons: Occasionally getting 'stuck' on something - usually around knee height - that you can't climb/jump over. Not anywhere near as crowded as the real place and one or two things misplaced or missing completely - such as Happy Valley and Kowloon (but I understand that certain things had to be sacrificed and United Front/Square Enix Eu did an excellent job in regards to this).As you can see, I'm kind of nit-picking on the cons. I just struggled to think of any negatives, such was the enjoyment I had with this game. This is the ONLY game where I fully enjoyed just rolling around and doing whatever took my fancy at the time. Yes, I did this in several gta's, but not to the extent I did it to in Sleeping Dogs and with nowhere near as much fun.I stand by my original statement - one of the best games I have ever played. On any platform. I think I'll give it a while and then play the (normal) version on my hexbox.*Extra bit 'cos have nominated this game for a steam award. Nothing has changed my opinion of this game - it's still awesome, it's still the only game I've 100%ed on my pc and I may never get around to playing it on my peasant box, but I will play this again on here!!

												I already played the sht out of this game on my xbox360 but I wanted to play it again so I got it for pc. Very pretty looking game, the city feels very alive too. The fighting system works really well (it kinda reminds me of the Batman games, which is a good thing) and all the moves look really cool. The driving is kinda eh.. but in exchange you can do all kinds of parkour moves and there are some pretty bad ♥♥♥ car and on foot chases. I thought the story was really good too. I don't have the best pc in the world but the game runs fine, most of the time. The framerate does drop (nowhere near unplayable though) when I go into very crowded areas but that's probably just my pc's fault. If you're into open world, action or fighting games at all you should definitely give this game a try			",132,18,35,9,23,4,8

												This game is amazing it blew my mind. It has excellent graphics, a great storyline, brutal fighting, and awesome character progression. I reccomend this game to people who like to feel like a badass and to people who love a great story. If you are one of those people then you should buy Sleeping Dogs.			",46,3,0,7,4,0,2

												Solid game with a surprisingly good soundtrack (particularly the Ninja Tune and Warp stations). Reminiscent of GTA games but with a primary focus on hand-to-hand combat instead of shooting. Tons of side missions and activities. Beautiful scenery and graphics. Runs at 60+ FPS without much trouble on my machine.Overall good port but the PC controls are a bit cumbersome. I'd recommend using an Xbox 360 controller (or a DS3 with XInput) if you have one. You can transition between a keyboard/mouse and controller seamlessly.			",61,7,0,6,6,0,1

												Why settle for simply shooting your enemies, when you can break every bone in their bodies and turn them into a bloody pulp.The battle mechanics is too much fun. The freeform fighting and environment based kills remind me of the Yakuza series while retaining its' own unique flavor. The driving mechanics, while not striving for realism, provides its' own brand of fun with the easy drifting and the sideswipe takedowns.While the amount of side activities aren't as varied as GTA (No tennis or darts, for example), the amount of available side activities is fun on its' own. When was the last time you visited a cockfighting ring, bet 100000 HK$ on a chicken named Sun Tzu, and lose it in 2 minutes?This game might not be your cup of tea if you only enjoy causing havoc and rampage and accrue wanted levels as in GTA, but if you do enjoy using the open world as a facet for the engaging narrative, then this game's for you. Bonus points for being able to replay the story missions after getting enough Face levels to wear that yellow Game of Death Bruce Lee jumpsuit xD10/10 Don't be a pok gai, get this game.

												This game's story was easily one of the best stories I've played through to the very date.  Is this game perfect? No, but it sure is worth a shot. In the game, you are Wei Chen, an undercover cop with a troubled past. Now, in the present, Wei is charged with the task of infiltrating a triad in Hong Kong, the Sun On Yee. It is up to him to do what ever it takes to get them to trust him and for him to take down the Sun On Yee from the inside. The story is one of the greatest parts about this game, it deals with 'stockholm like' stuff and getting overly attached, it also blurs the clear cut line between what is right and wrong. The characters are also memorable and well written.   The gameplay is also another great thing about this game. The game is an open world game where you can drive cars or take taxes to your destinations. Driving around the city is pretty fun and the city is fairly large. Along with the main missions, there are other things to be done, such as go on dates, do favors for people, shop for clothes and food, buy cars, stop drug deals, steal cars, karaoke (Yes, karaoke), and do police cases. There are also collectible items and shires to collect/activate, which reward you (New fighting moves and health upgrades).   The fighting is another key factor in this game in which the creators take pride in. The fighting is similiar to the Batman Arkham series, but is different enough that it isn't copying it. As you go you, you learn more moves, which is extremely helpful at times to take down those annoying thugs. The fighting is martial arts based and can be very satisfying. There's also 'environmental take-downs', which allow you to shove someone into a fish tank, or close a door on someone's face, or even put them in an ice chopper (brutal!). There's also gunplay in this game that isn't really anything new, but is still fun. There is, however; a slow motion mechanic that is pretty cool. The driving isn't also anything that new, but the cars handle well, depending on the car, and it does have some pretty great driving mechanics.  The one problem that I had with the game is that a good majority of the buildings in the game were just shells. It really doesn't affect the gameplay that much, but it is still worth mentioning. Like many open world games, there are radio stations. The music provided in the game is pretty great and adds something special to long drives or even some chase scenes. The missions in the game are very fun, some are similiar but most feel different and are definitely worth the time to play through them (they aren't usually that long). Being that this version is the Definitive Edition, it also comes with the dlc, which adds some more story to do after the campaign. The dlc is definutely worth checking out too.  Overall, I had a blast playing through this and I look forward to coming back to in the near future. I personally got this game on sale, but I'd definitely buy it for its full retail price!

												This game was simply amazing, but even saying that doesn't do it justice.Pros:-Nice progression. You really notice how you're getting stronger and yet it's not too hard or easy to do go about doing-Great story. The story following Mr. Shen will have you guessing and is extremely immersive.-Music. The ambient music is very good quality and when driving cars/motorcycles the radio stations offer diverse types of music from Classical to Heavy Metal to Rap. Even Techno-esque dubstep type is in there.-The Combat is simply amazing. The gunplay is kinda meh due to slow-time, but the hand-to-hand fighting and melee combat is extremely rewarding and, to put it simply, makes you feel like a bad-♥♥♥ while doing it. Best part is the fighting doesn't look cheesey or anything like that either.-A serious game that throws jokes in at just the right timeCons:-While the character models and world models look pretty nice, the lip synching looked a little off-Stores look really fake due to them being a ""Wallpaper,"" and not an actual store. Still, can't complain too much due to it greatly reducing the amount of lag.-Some of the Context situations (Example: Shift to jump on a car rather then slide over it) can be clunky-Too short. I mean, I put 28.5 hours into the main story (There are dlc missions as well,) but I ran out of story... That counts as a bad thing, right?			",135,12,0,25,10,1,26

												Sleeping Dogs, I must say, is one of the best story-driven sandbox RPG game I have played so far. In addition, Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition brought the game to its near maximum potential due to its graphics update and the whole environment that have been added into the game. Certain physics and other stuff have been implemented as well to add realness and finesse as you play trough it:- Hair, clothes, and boob physics (cause, why not) :3- More people = more carnage- More vibrant atmosphere in various places- 1080p goodnessAnnoying/recurring bugs:- Sudden sfx loss (when riding a boat or using a certain type of vehicle)- Counter mechanics is still a bit clunky (in my opinion) but alot more responsive than it used to.- Certain glitch occurence (i.e Zodiac Tournament).There might not be alot of changes, but it is certain that Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition have captured the Hong Kong experience once more.

												I really enjoyed SD:DF. Take the mechanics that made the GTA games fun and combine it with an edgy and interesting storyline set in modern day Hong Kong. Wei Shen is a Chinese-American returning home after many years with a chip on his shoulder regarding the corrupt and powerful triad that messed with his family long ago. The Sun On Yee, the game begins as Wei, now an officer of the law infiltrates the Sun On Yee through an old friend Jackie and the story just continues to build from there.You are given the ability to roam free in the large city of Hong Kong with side quests litered everywhere. From progresing the Police quest line, to the (main) Triad story there are quests to increase your face (reputation), unlock new cars through street races, street brawls, and many variets there of. To add additional flavour you can unlock additional skills and attributes depending on how many side quests you have done which can turn you into a martial arts, asskicking, gun welding unstopable machine.Highly recommend, I played it in small-chunks after work and it kept me thoroughly entertained.

												How can you ♥♥♥♥ up the camera THIS badly. It tries so hard to be hands free its useless, and you cant reverse without the camera auto focusing forward and you not knowing where you're going. THE ONLY VEHICLE WHERE THE CAMERA TURNS AROUND WHEN U REVERSE IS THE ♥♥♥♥ING BOATS. YOU GOTTA BE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ME.Gets boring and repetative 15 minutes into a session.Random events you'll drive by will make you randomly fail because you don't give a ♥♥♥♥ if a drunk is harassing a store, the game dares to take you out of your vehicle and basically restart you on the street for no reason and restarts your navigational point because you dont want to do the event. PLS.Even if you have a holstered pistol the game will randomly remove it completely if you get restarted forcing you to do boring 5 click combat because theres really only one effective fighting move and countering.Any mission or favor you do seems glitched half the time, almost half of the missions I do i need to restart because something's glitched. First 10 hours was fine, now it feels even more than half ♥♥♥♥♥ than before, quarter ♥♥♥♥♥.Cops spawn right infront of you not giving a ♥♥♥♥ you can see them or behind you after you just escaped them.Even with all these faults, I still like the game, but I cant look past them when I have to fight the camera every few seconds, theres no way to disable it, and no mods either.If the game mechanics seem to be built to ♥♥♥♥ you off, how can I recommend being annoyed?

												It's hard not to draw comparison to the more popular Grand Theft Auto, but it still exceeds at being it's own thing.Sleeping Dogs takes place in Hong Kong and the map is about as big as GTA IV.You can traverse the map how you like: By Car, Bike, Foot, Boat.The biggest difference from GTA is that this is a more brawler-melee oriented game. You learn and practice martial arts to take down your enemies - you find melee weapons and firearms in certain locations.You play as an undercover cop who has a job to infiltrate the Triads and take them down from the inside.I don't know if you're aware of gangster life, but this ♥♥♥♥ is gritty and intense. Definitely one of the most immersive storylines of 2012.You have three reputations to choose to uphold: Cop, Triad and Face.You earn Cop by doing Cop missions, Triad by Triad missions, and Face by doing favors on the street.There is plenty to do so you will never be bored: Drag Races, Underground Fight Clubs, Murder Mysteries to solve - the game engine does an A+ job at making Hong Kong feel alive.12/10________________________________________________________________________________PERSONAL EXPERIENCE:I ran down the street in my Sun Wukong outfit and some jerk hit me with his SUV. I hijacked the nearest bike, caught up with him, stood on it's seat and jumped onto the hood of the SUV.I opened the driver-side door and threw my newly sworn enemy onto the rocky gravel below me to his death. I drove into the sunset, satisfied with my new SUV.I drove the SUV into the Ocean.I am the Emperor of Hong Kong.Don't ♥♥♥♥ with the Emperor.			",176,8,2,13,3,3,8

Sleeping DogsThis one is good. You are an undercover HKPD agent who is tasked with infiltrating the ranks of the Triad Gangs, in order to exact some justice. Along the way, you make choices; you face tough decisions and you become immersed in a alternate reality form of Hong Kong. The city is riddled with violent gangs (unlike the real Hong Kong) and as a HKPD officer, you have to weigh in decisions of going dirty or doing it by the law. The graphics are more PC-worthy, with my only complaint being, that the SSAO is actually not that appealing. What makes this different from GTA and GTA clones, is that it emphasizes the use of martial arts in combat, instead of melee weapons and guns. You do have access to melee weapons and guns, but they are not the do-all be-all of the game. I do praise the adoption of native cantonese language which bears similarity to what you hear in Hong Kong; there are of course, optional english subtitles for those who need them. There is some touches of humor, but the story and dialogue is more on a serious level. There are minigames such as karaoke (reminds me of a form of guitar hero or audiosurf), you can do police missions or triad missions, you can buy cheap and really nice cars and keep them in a garage; you can call a valet or taxi driver. Also, thanks to the definitive edition: You can max out the crowd density, which depicts a more accurate Hong Kong instead of the older console version which was optimized for old consoles. You will pick up the fact that the map of Hong Kong in this game isn't a 100% accurate match of the real Hong Kong, the roads are different and the island is the primary location. There are some places which bear resemblance to Hong Kong, (like victoria peak); but other than that the designers did some embellishing to fit the story, which is fine in my opinion.All in all, I recommend this game for those who like open-city martial arts GTA style games. The story is good and the gameplay is entertaining, with a certain amount of replay value. Now, instead of giving pros and cons; I will give the recipe to pork buns. Why?

												The first open world game that actually makes you feel like doing the side missions, the story is great and the character development is awesome, except wtf happened to amanda, she just disappeared. Mrs. Chu is just savage which you know is pretty badass for an old lady with that meat cleaver. The game physics is just awesome and also the fighting mechanics are also just way better than gta. Also they don't focus on guns too much which is nice as it brings a change to the frigging arsenal of guns you can pull out of your butt in gta. Well this game honestly has no cons its actually one of the most badass games i have ever played. I would say that you should be able to customize your cars a bit especially some NO2 is required because well there are lots of street races and all.

												One day this game went on to Xbox Live for a free game with gold so I decided to get it. It was the original version and this one hadn't come out yet. I loved the game so much, and it was my favorite game. Sadly, my Xbox broke for unknown reasons and I was unable to play the game for a while. Then one day i see that this new and improved version of Sleeping Dogs has been released, and by then I had purchased a gaming PC so I was very exited when I found out I would be able to play Sleeping Dogs once again.I bought this, downloaded it, and played it. I spent 15 hours playing it on my first day of owning it. Now, the Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition goes through various improvements from the previous version. I will now go step by step describing them.Graphical Stuff: 9/10The trailer boasts about graphical and texture improvements, and they weren't lying. There aren't much improvements to the graphics as there are to the textures. Lighting is very clearly improved and clothing and hair are no longer static. There is a few minor glitches to this kind of things but nothing too noticeable.Audio: 5/10I personally cant see much difference.Gameplay: 8/10Sleeping Dogs: DE has a few changes to the gameplay. For example, the city of Hong Kong feels much more immersive, there is more pedestrians and traffic making Hong Kong feel more like Hong Kong. The driving mechanics feel much smoother and better. But now for cons. some of the walking controls feel very wonky and sometimes it is more difficult to actually do the parkour in the game. The game is also no longer able to generate everything in your general area, so sometimes you'll take a few step and all of a sudden the game will span a group of civilians right next to Wei. and sometimes people spawn in the sky and fall to Earth. but overall, really good gameplay. SPOILERS FROM HERE ON! I love this game so much, the story is amazing and there is so much attachment to characters. I felt bad for Mrs. Chu when Winston died at his wedding, and cried when Wei found Jackie Ma's dead body. When you find that Pendrew was a bad guy I was shocked. So much happens within this game and I hope to never stop playing itThat's why my final rating for this game is 9/10.───────────────────████───────────────────█████───────────────────██████───────────────────███████──────────────────████████──────────────────████████─────────────────█████████────────────────█████████───────────────█████████──────────────█████████──────────────██████████████████────────────█████████████████████───────────███████████████████████████████─██████████████████████████████████─███████████████████████████████████─█████Recommended█████████████████████─████████████████████████████████████─████████████████████████████████████─████████████████████████████████████─███████████████████████████████████─██████████████████████████████████─█████████████████████████████████─████████████████████████████████─███████████████████████			",122,14,4,14,9,0,7

												If any one was worried this game is not only a HD revamp. There are also some added content. Little red bags of cash. New cop missions and they got rid of the crap lock on system so combat is smoth. The performance has been improved as well!Before on the original I had to run minimum setings which tanked hard core when on a driving mission. Now I am on medium setings with some slownes but I can still have great control while driving very fast. There is also a cool setting where you can control the amount of cars and people in the city. Lower it for performance and you should be fine if your runing a low end laptop like me. For its price and all the DLC content in it I think its very worth the buy. Defenly get it if you never tryed it before. There are a TON of things to do in this game. Charaters in the game are memorable. Story is great.  ",65,3,0,10,3,1,11

												""A man without pork bun is never truly a whole man"" - Pork Bun Vendor8/10 game overall - great heart, great core ideas, some tough bugs but overall a very very well produced game. The minigames actually feel connected to gameplay, the sidequests are just interesting enough to pursue whenever possible, and the combat is very fluid. Unlocking skills feels natural enough, with none of them really feeling 'essential' or gamebreaking. Once guns are unlocked, they dont become the new main focus in what is a mostly melee game. The story is actually well written, and kept me engaged.Worth buying just to play essentially Grand Theft Auto: Hong Kong.			",338,55,10,32,44,3,71

												Not sure what it is that grabs me about this game, but I really enjoy it. Played through fully on Xbox 360 when it first came out, Xbox One, and now PC. The combat system is pretty good, but in all honesty, you can finish the melee side of the game by mashing the X button and kicking everyone to death.Although it's enjoyable, it's not without it's bugs and annoyances, the main one for me being the world's worst parcour running. One minute you can run up a wall to grab a ledge, the next you can't jump over a waist high fence! I kept experiencing audio loops too, where a gunshot or explosion sound would loop until I exited the game.Expansion wise, the nightmare DLC is pretty lame, and can be rattled off in about an hour and is very repetative. Don't go expecting anything on par with Red Dead Redemption's nightmare expansion. Zodiac Island (Enter the Dragon) is pretty cool, but again just over an hour. Year of the Dragon is pretty good too. Much of the other DLC was inventory items, collections, tweaks, etc.All in all, I'd definately recommend buying this if you've never played it. For my money it beats the whole GTA series in to the ground, then special moves it into the wood chipper!			",129,14,4,6,6,0,21

												After recalibrating my Life I've now decided I want to live in Hong Kong. I have mastered Martial Arts and Am now moving on to impressing The Beautiful Hong kong Women. Only problem is Am not sure whats more rewarding arresting a Drug pusher or beating up inocent bystanders and senior citizens. Its the story of my Life and I can't stop playing...The graphics are amazing, The realism is really captivating just when you think you've seen it all, it rains and you open up your umbrlla. Honestly, if The cars were alittle more detailed and responsive, This game would definately be Alot better than any of the Grand Theft Auto series.As far as Story line and playablity..its still a complete 10. The fighting sequences are amazing. Theres nothing more rewarding than putting a Bad guys Head thru a glass table or into a wall, These are things that Grand Theft does not do as well..rewarding battles and a very challenging story line..you feel like your not just playing a game your accomplishing goals all the time. Amazing!!Again another area Grand Theft doesn't handle as well...rewards. This Game is very rewarding. Your given new outfits, New Fighting Combo's, new vehicals, lets just say This Game will not leave you unrewarded!  Its a statement that no other game has matched since its release...funnny thing these guys did all this before Theft V... Great-Amazing-Beautifully Done.. would recommend to anyone who owns a joystick. What a blast. Thanks Steam for another great recommendation. A classic tribute to game developers and a true Gift to Gamers. Love IT.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Load times are acceptable and menus are easy enough to navigate.You certainly won’t find it ""a beautiful game"", but it looks nice. It’s too bad that there are some texture loading issues and a poor draw distance, though.Camera angles can get wonked-out while fighting and especially while driving. But melee combat and gunplay alike are still a lot of fun, and the driving is generally sublime.			",233,87,0,25,19,2,9

So my advice would be to enjoy this game from start to finish and who knows, you may just want to playthrough 3 times or more :)			",56,1,1,1,0,1,0

												One of the best single player games I played. (I know I wrote it several times but meh, I'm what french people call an eternal dissatisfied man, so when I love a game I have to recommend it!)First, playing in Asia is uncommon enough to be noticed. The environment makes you travel and the moments when you see Honkong by night, with its lights reflected on the wet roads are intense and unforgettable.In addition, as an eternal dissatisfied player, I often uninstall a game when I feel that I'm not not free of my movements enough. This is what I loved in the game: the Parkour influences in Sleeping Dogs delighted me.And it's the same for the fights. As a martial arts practicer, I hate when I fight scene isn't realistic. Here, you learn real boxing and kung-fu moves. The weapons are quite rare, which makes you fight your enemies with your bare hands.But, the thing that spoiled the gameplay is the driving levels. You have to drive a lot for your missions and it's so hard to handle the cars.The scenario is maybe the best part. It's really simple but effective: you're an undercover cop who must infiltrate a dangerous gang. So you have two personalities and two kinds of opposed missions. Your character will have affection for some members of your gang (no spoil). The only improvement the game could have is a choice system like in Mass Effect to impact your story. But even if you don't really make choices, your character's are always legit and don't really stop your immersion.Do I recommend it? YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.9.25/10			",59,4,0,6,1,0,2

												A game that should have received a sequel, SD brings players into a vibrant Hong Kong, eschewing guns for a visceral hand-to-hand combat system. It's big, it's flashy, it has great music and it doesn't take itself too seriously. Whenever I miss HK I just need to fire up SD to re-capture the feeling. I do hope the developers get picked up by other studios, they showed their talent with this game.			",458,162,28,85,56,3,116

Cars can be a bit wonky to control but once you get the hang of it, its not that bad (it's much better with a controller). I wish more of the dialogue was in Cantonese (with subs obviously) since you ARE in Hong Kong, but that's just a minor problem. It's a shame that the studio that made the game shut down.

												This game is flat out awesome and one of th best open world with story games I've ever played. Graphics are decent for it's age, the voice acting is great, the combat is varied and tricky at times and while the hand to hand portion is not dificult it is very satisifying espeically once you unlock some of the hard hitting moves. The story is immersive and while predictable at times is still fun to play out and watch.Also the majoritity of the DLCs (which are included with this version) are good and fun to play. In short this game is worth a full price purchase and if you can find it on sale for 50% or more there is no reason not to snag this game cause it will be worth every cent.And if all that isn't good enough you get ot play as a character named Wei Shen who does bare a slight resemblance to and likely inspired slighty by the Big Trouble in Litttle China character of the same name!

												I loved Sleeping Dogs begining to end, with it's great radio soundtrack, interesting story and characters, amazing fighting mechanics which will actually keep you from button mashing, and it's atmospheric and immersive world. A game like this will really make you wish it was first person.Now, on with the ratings.Story: 8.25 / 10You play as undercover cop Wei Shen, working with the Hong Kong Police Department to bring down triad gangs in Hong Kong upon moving back to the city after living in the United States.Characters: 9 / 10I felt the characters were unique and amazing in their own way.Missions: 7.5 / 10Although the main story missions were somewhat cliched and mostly combat-oriented, I did have fun with them. The activities are quite lacking, but the side missions are very enjoyable.Soundtrack: 8 / 10The radio stations have extremely good music compared to other games like GTA. In addition, the oriental-style OST added to the immersion factor.Combat: 9 / 10The combos prevent button mashing while keeping it interesting. Fighting is very fluid, and shooting is solid. Weapons can be picked up, and the environment around you can be used to defeat your enemies in entertaining and enjoyable ways. Also, as small of a feature as it is, the blood forming on combatants and inanimate objects give the feeling that you're really doing something.World: 9.75 / 10This is probably the best world I've seen in an open world game comparable to GTA and others. The city sounds, small alleyways, street vendors, city lights, bystanders, and beautiful weather bring this area together in a living, immersive, atmospheric, awesome world. My only complaint is that there aren't many areas with nature, and instead the world is 95% city.Overall: 52 points out of 60. A must buy for those who love any of the following: PORK BUNS, open world games, fighting games, crime games, and of course, the amazing PORK BUN. All hail PORK BUN.			",155,13,3,20,9,0,0

												It's a great game, IMHO better than GTA V. After playing countless hours of the xbox version, I bought the game via Steam, mostly for the portability of having it on my laptop. Unfortunately, the game doesn't seem to like SOMETHING about my computer, as it crashes every ~15 minutes. Would still recommmend to others, I've done a lot of shady modification to this computer, which is likely the cause of the issues. Or it could be Win10 again, who knows.9/10, Great game.

												This game is great. The combat system is fantastic and it's an open world so there's plenty of possibilities. A vital tip is that you should get the full ""Mountain Triad Clothing Set"" asap because with the 15% bonus exp you should be able to get all 10 upgrades by the end game. Triad exp, is really only viable through the main story quest line, whereas cop exp can be gained through a ton of side stuff. I'm currently playing through again because I fell short at 9 nine triad upgrades last play through.			",118,22,4,7,17,2,9

Jet Li meets The DepartedSleeping Dogs satisfies the need for a fast paced, action packed crime thriller with a gripping story line. Competing with the ever popular Grand Theft Auto franchise, Square Enix has delivered a masterpiece of dramatic, story-telling adventure. And the story is where Sleeping Dogs surpasses the competition.SD strikes a neat balance between action and cutscenes -- which are beautifully directed. I never found myself waiting for the scene to end, perhaps due to their brevity, but definitely because they're fun to watch! The plot is gripping, the characters are authentic, and their journeys are moving.There are a couple of parts where the plot progression seems rushed, but character development still feels genuine. About half-way through the game, I started to feel like Jackie was my best friend too! And did I mention how great the animation in the cutscenes looks?At least as important as the story telling is the gameplay. Like other games in it's genre, it has a tendency to throw control mechanics at you that are overly simple, yet obnoxiously difficult to execute. Combat and driving controls come with a steep learning curve, but are manageable... but only just. Despite the difficulty, fist fighting a bunch of thugs, or shooting it out while slow mo flying over obstacles is a blast! This all does get easier as you level up with the build ssytem learning new kung fu techniques and street criminal tactics, Add in parkour and some fun mini games to break up the monotony and it's a really fun experience. This game isn't as bad as others in terms of doing several missions that feel exactly the same. You'll still end up chasing down a lot of people, but it's... better some how.There are some kinks to work out, like running the game in compatability mode was the only way to keep it from looping on the loading screen between missions. The skinny: like every other game in this genre, Sleeping Dogs is plagued with some issues, but for me, it pulls ahead of the pack and is a great game. If you like GTA-type games, you're going to love Sleeping Dogs.			",33,1,0,6,0,0,4

												The best singleplayer game I've played in a couple of years.If you like kung-fu action movies with Jet Li, this game is better.Scenery is beautiful, full of colours, neons and Chinese atmosphere. Night market with pushy salesmen or Soho at night - aahhh.The storyline is so addictive, that I played 3-4 hours at once.Gameplay is fast and intense. In most missions you'll find fight, car chases and shooting. There are also stealth and logic parts, like phone tracking or hacking.You've to earn reputation to get bonuses, can dress Wei up like you want or learn new kung-fu moves - another big plus.Only bad thing about it: It's to short. I needed 25 hours to complete main storyline and get most of bonuses.Rate: 9/10, because I could never play it again for the first time.			",48,4,0,9,3,0,7

												Oh my god...This game is so awesome that I can't write a review without cantonese slang.. lol :D. Really realistic enough for a game.His counter moves in a fight and everything is so realistic I would say, being a police and doing all the thug life stuff is really cool... I've been playing two days straight for 5~6 hours + each day, done with half of the game though not everything I do is on the main mission line (green). Its awesome and its 100% worth it. I paid 10$ for this originally costing 30$ game. I only feel sad for one part, i.e the day after I bought it for 10$, it went for 75% summer sale to 2.5$, so all I can say is grab it, those of you who can.PS: Mac users: works perfectly fine.

												Good graphics, voice acting and good enough undercover cop story. In terms of custumization, cars, outfits, girlfriends, side missions and city scale, it's on par with GTA IV, but with San Andreas or Vice City's arcade style, for a kung fu movie cinematic atmosphere. Really good, really cheap.Played it on PC and Mac as well, excellent performances on both.			",45,8,0,11,8,0,32

												If you enjoy open world games with a rich story, then you will definitely fall in love with this one!There are so many upgrades, fighting combos, amazing radio stations and, well things to do, that you will not want to stop playing.The story in this game had me hooked from start to finish, and the characters, I fell in love with them :DThe unique martial arts aspect of this game is very satisfying and easy to use. I wish the developers would make a sequel, although that is very unlikely... So my advice would be to enjoy this game from start to finish and who knows, you may just want to playthrough 3 times or more :)			",56,1,1,1,0,1,0

Now I have to decrease it to low setting and even then I only get 20 to 30 fps.  I heard this was a problem with the original sleeping dogs but I would think the remastered would solve these issues.EDIT: Looks like the mistake was on my end.  With that said I do recommend this game.  Fun Story, good character and and overall fun experience.  Gotta say though my favorite thing to do is jump on a motorcycle with the cops chasing me and drive full speed toward an oncoming car and just before hitting it, pop and wheelie and use the car as a ramp.

												Wow! I should say that I haven't played Sleeping Dogs first-issue, and can't judge how much it changed (or not).. But, what i saw here, like seeing totally new game, is much better than GTA IV. Can't compare to GTA V cause I haven't got (and don't like) console and haven't played it yet.I always thought that GTA is unique and I love this whole series from the time when it was 2d, you know. And now.. Sleeping Dogs.. Wow..Its really well done - fighting system is fascinating! I really like how its is animated, how it is feels and the difficulty is perfect tuned for me. Every fight you can win without spending 999 tries like in Dark Souls, but if you relax a bit and go casual style - you lose - its just perfect!Second - I like the car physics - its way better than in GTA IV. Also a small detail - traffic goes left handed in HongKong - it is a trifle, but I don't know why it fascinates me. Feels so fresh :)Also I really like China spirit and have not much respect for American one. Yes - they all gangsters in both games, but Americans feels so empty and dumb, and Chinesse.. they have history much bigger than ours and it matters.What more to say.. I really happy that I found this game and will go continue playing ^_^P.S. I haven't completed or even played much yet, but I realized that I want to go here and write the review immediately!

Vast Hong Kong city places to visit, foods to eat not without it's flaws though there are a lot of one sided characters that appear for mission or two then you just forget about em, but there is also a lot of memorable characters in latter stage of the game that you just gonna loveGameplay is tons of fun with varied triad and cop missions the movement of characters are fluid and so is combat, driving lacks though  gotta give extra props for amazing soundtracks and good radio tracks I haven't touched the DLC yet but I suggest this game for people who enjoy good story with GTA-esque gameplay			",72,11,0,6,2,0,2

												3 AM in Hong Kong. A group of thugs loiter around a parking lot, waiting for the drug-dealing boss to come back with their pork buns. Suddenly a police motorcycle crashes through a barrier, Cantonese hip hop music blaring. The rider, Wei Shen, wearing a purple puffy coat and aviator sunglasses, leaps off, dramatically drawing his pistol as he falls through the air in slow motion, frantically firing at one thug before finally managing to hit the headshot. Wei proceeds to knee each thug in the groin before throwing them into nearby dumpsters and trunks. With the thugs in pieces and/or car trunks, he hacks the nearby security camera, hops back on his motorcycle, and peels out of the parking lot as the song starts over from the beginning. He hits several pedestrians but doesn't stop, because he's feeling hungry. Hungry for pork buns.			",401,74,13,28,23,5,47

												Okay so i've got Sleeping Dogs, and i came in expecting a somewhat NEW game since this is my first time buying a ""remake"" edition or whatever they call it.  The game is fun, if you don't have the actual game yet then get this 100% However, if you've already got the game, completed the game or don't have the DLC's then it's not really worth it. However this game is amazing, so i bought it anyway since i wanted to replay it. Better story than GTA in my opinion, amazing sceneary and not the old boring Americas. What i did notice, it doesn't have many customization options, clothing is bare, so are cars.			",114,7,3,9,11,1,6

												The destructible environments add to the already great combat. There are way more and varied people around in the game world and I love how they have integrated the DLC into the main game. You no longer just get a bunch of free stuff in your wardrobe and garage, you either have to buy the stuff from a special vendor or earn some of them from missions in the game. Even the Red Envelopes are now hidden packages instead of just right next to the garages like before. To me it really balances out the game much better then before. The only DLC it doesn't seem to include is the Top Dog Gold and Silver packs that let you level up, it would have been nice to have the option to use them in this version but overall I am kind of glad they are not there as that did make the old version very easy and less fun to me.The improvements are very good in this version and don't believe the people saying this game looks worse then the HD pack from the old version because that is total BS. Whatever their reason or agenda is I'm not sure, but look for yourself at real images from an impartial sight and not some jokers personal images that could be from the lowest settings or even the original game.http://tech4gamers.com/sleeping-dogs-sd-vs-sleeping-dogs-definitive-edition-graphics-comparison-and-benchmarks/ ",91,9,0,14,3,0,4

The with guns it is farirly standard but the hand-to-hand tries to be like Arkham but reaction time can be a little off when you see the indicatior. Beyond that I would recomend this game to anyone who is a fan of the GTA style of game.			",102,16,0,14,6,2,0

												If you are in desperate need of an action packed story driven game, this is for you. Sleeping Dogs has absolutely outstanding graphics for its age. The game has fantastic voice acting, animations and characters. The game comes with many dramatic losses as well as adrenaline driven missions. I would 100% suggest this to anyone that enjoys free roam and action. There is something about hopping from one car to another in a high speed chase which makes your heart rushing.

												Worked great two days ago.. on extreme setting at 60 fps. Played it today had like 6 fps on extreme don't know why tf it decreased. Didn't change anything. Now I have to decrease it to low setting and even then I only get 20 to 30 fps.  I heard this was a problem with the original sleeping dogs but I would think the remastered would solve these issues.EDIT: Looks like the mistake was on my end.  With that said I do recommend this game.  Fun Story, good character and and overall fun experience.  Gotta say though my favorite thing to do is jump on a motorcycle with the cops chasing me and drive full speed toward an oncoming car and just before hitting it, pop and wheelie and use the car as a ramp.

												Sleeping Doge is an open world action-adventure game similar to GTA. It deals with the life an undercover cop by the name of Wei Shen who is given the task of investigating a Triad group called the Sun On Yee. Pros: -Good Story.-Good Music.-Good Voice Acting.-Fun combat system.-Improved Graphics.-Definitive Edition Includes DLCs.-Simple and fluid gameplay.Cons?: -No real end game content.-Missions are repetitive.-Driving is not fun. Ramming however, is hilarious.Overall, Sleeping Dogs is a solid game that is fun similar to other games of the genre. What sets it apart from the others is its story and braindead, yet fun combat system. I highly recommend it, especially if you can get it in a sale. This game is literally what Shenmue 3 should be like.			",35,16,0,13,5,0,2

												A great open-world action game. I was drawn in immediately by the aesthetic, which is done very well, and kept playing because of the simple, yet very satisfying, brutal combat system. With strings of combos, you can break enemies' legs, arms, faces, and smash them into fans and refridgeraters. The story is good - it feels a little more fresh to be part of the police, working undercover. It doesn't go quite as deep as I had hoped it would, but the game does openly explore some moral boundaries related to killing which adds depth.While the driving is a bit wonky, and at times frustrating, the burnout-style ""ramming"" is really fun and arcadey. Overall, this is a great action game, and one I would even recommend over grand theft auto.			",316,85,35,51,25,2,58

tl;dr: Sleeping Dogs is a superb open world action game that will make you feel like the star of a kung fu movie.Sleeping Dogs is one of my favorite open world games ever, I played it so much when it originally released and I was surprised how great the game actually was. All of the environments in Definitive Edition look beautiful especially when running on higher settings. The gun combat isn't bad but it's not really anything special, where Sleeping Dogs really shines is with the hand to hand combat. The fighting mechanics feel great and throughout the game you learn new fighting techniques to add to your arsenal. There are also several different environment takedowns you can preform that are brutal as they are awesome. Sleeping Dogs also allows you to free run and preform stunts all over Hong Kong. Where Sleeping Dogs took me by surprise the most is its story. In Sleeping Dogs you play as Wei Shen, a undercover cop tasked to infiltrate the Triads. The story is well written and all of the characters are intriguing. The story takes lots of twists and turns, is mostly action packed, and makes it harder for Wei to decide if he is more of a cop or more of a Triad as it progresses. Wei Shen is a fantastic protagonist, he is just a truely bad ♥♥♥ character, one of my favorite video game protagonists of all time for sure. While I'm at it I might as well say that all of the other main characters are great and well voiced too. There is always something to do in Sleeping Dogs; you can go do a mission for the Triads, do a police mission, help a stranger in need, participate in a race, participate in a fighting tournament, bet on a ♥♥♥♥ fight, go on a date, take out rival gangs, learn new fighting moves from the dojo, explore the world to find lock boxes, plus lots more and everything else you could expect from a open world sandbox action game. So in closing, Sleeping Dogs is a amazing game filled with action, narrative, and variety that I highly recommend to anyone who is even just a little interested in the game, it should pleasantly surprise you as it did to me. Sleeping Dogs is a hidden gem among open world games and one of the best open world games I have ever played.			",429,56,15,20,28,5,28

												Like Grand Theft Auto had sweet, sweet babies with Saints Row in a Hong Kong back alley and abandoned it at the doorstep of a martial arts school. Hong Kong looks beautiful, the combat is incredibly satisfying, but driving is a little hard to get used to if you're used to playing Grand Theft Auto and/or Saints Row. I like the storyline, but it left much to be desired. But you don't play games like this for the story, you play it to kick ♥♥♥ and take names.			",108,17,2,18,10,1,16

												Would I recommend this?  That's actually not a 'yes' or a 'no'.  If you do not own the original, then yes, I would recommend you buy this, as Sleeping Dogs is, in my opinion, a very brilliant and under-rated game.  If you do own the original, then, no, I wouldn't recommend it unless you like the look of enough of the DLC available that you don't already have that this will actually end up being cheaper than buying that DLC.  Why do I say this?  Well, the graphics, once you actually get them working right, do show improvement over the original, and the world feels a bit more populated, but the difference is more of a case of a minor nip and tuck, rather than a jaw-dropping overhaul, so it's not really worth even the discounted price for that alone.

												Wow! I should say that I haven't played Sleeping Dogs first-issue, and can't judge how much it changed (or not).. But, what i saw here, like seeing totally new game, is much better than GTA IV. Can't compare to GTA V cause I haven't got (and don't like) console and haven't played it yet.I always thought that GTA is unique and I love this whole series from the time when it was 2d, you know. And now.. Sleeping Dogs.. Wow..Its really well done - fighting system is fascinating! I really like how its is animated, how it is feels and the difficulty is perfect tuned for me. Every fight you can win without spending 999 tries like in Dark Souls, but if you relax a bit and go casual style - you lose - its just perfect!Second - I like the car physics - its way better than in GTA IV. Also a small detail - traffic goes left handed in HongKong - it is a trifle, but I don't know why it fascinates me. Feels so fresh :)Also I really like China spirit and have not much respect for American one. Yes - they all gangsters in both games, but Americans feels so empty and dumb, and Chinesse.. they have history much bigger than ours and it matters.What more to say.. I really happy that I found this game and will go continue playing ^_^P.S. I haven't completed or even played much yet, but I realized that I want to go here and write the review immediately!

The game is fun, if you don't have the actual game yet then get this 100% However, if you've already got the game, completed the game or don't have the DLC's then it's not really worth it. However this game is amazing, so i bought it anyway since i wanted to replay it. Better story than GTA in my opinion, amazing sceneary and not the old boring Americas.

												The destructible environments add to the already great combat. There are way more and varied people around in the game world and I love how they have integrated the DLC into the main game. You no longer just get a bunch of free stuff in your wardrobe and garage, you either have to buy the stuff from a special vendor or earn some of them from missions in the game. Even the Red Envelopes are now hidden packages instead of just right next to the garages like before. To me it really balances out the game much better then before. The only DLC it doesn't seem to include is the Top Dog Gold and Silver packs that let you level up, it would have been nice to have the option to use them in this version but overall I am kind of glad they are not there as that did make the old version very easy and less fun to me.The improvements are very good in this version and don't believe the people saying this game looks worse then the HD pack from the old version because that is total BS. Whatever their reason or agenda is I'm not sure, but look for yourself at real images from an impartial sight and not some jokers personal images that could be from the lowest settings or even the original game.http://tech4gamers.com/sleeping-dogs-sd-vs-sleeping-dogs-definitive-edition-graphics-comparison-and-benchmarks/ ",91,9,0,14,3,0,4

Like GTA but in Hong Kong and more focused on melee.Pros: -Great story-Very good melee combat system-Good dialogue-Amazing in-game radio-Lots of content-Very good bang for your buck when on sale-Beatiful world, scenery and lighting-Lots of collectibles and vehicles-All DLC includedCons:-No planes-Some side missions can get a bit repetitive-Vehicle control is kind of dodgy-Sometimes GPS gives you wrong directions-Gun play isn't greatOverall I think this game is a must for any open-world fan or any gamer to be honest.8/10			",202,45,9,24,15,7,34

												THIS GAME HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BEAT GTA!!!The game has nice graphics similar to the latest GTA series:GTA V.However,it has features that GTA doesn't have such as:-Ability to have multiple vehicles;regardless of cars or motorcycle parked in the parking-lot similar to the mechanics of a garage.-Martial arts ofc!It has an interesting story line with the hero being a guy named Wei Shen,an undercover cop situated in Hong Kong and disguised as a gangster to tackle the crimes in HK.It gets interesting as the story goes as Wei slowly meets gang leaders and well,I wouldn't spoil the experience for those who haven't bought this game.IF YOU HAVEN'T BUY THIS GAME YET,BUY IT!!!Btw,martial arts ftw :D			",35,1,0,0,1,0,0

												Worked great two days ago.. on extreme setting at 60 fps. Played it today had like 6 fps on extreme don't know why tf it decreased. Didn't change anything. Now I have to decrease it to low setting and even then I only get 20 to 30 fps.  I heard this was a problem with the original sleeping dogs but I would think the remastered would solve these issues.EDIT: Looks like the mistake was on my end.  With that said I do recommend this game.  Fun Story, good character and and overall fun experience.  Gotta say though my favorite thing to do is jump on a motorcycle with the cops chasing me and drive full speed toward an oncoming car and just before hitting it, pop and wheelie and use the car as a ramp.

												Wow! I should say that I haven't played Sleeping Dogs first-issue, and can't judge how much it changed (or not).. But, what i saw here, like seeing totally new game, is much better than GTA IV. Can't compare to GTA V cause I haven't got (and don't like) console and haven't played it yet.I always thought that GTA is unique and I love this whole series from the time when it was 2d, you know. And now.. Sleeping Dogs.. Wow..Its really well done - fighting system is fascinating! I really like how its is animated, how it is feels and the difficulty is perfect tuned for me. Every fight you can win without spending 999 tries like in Dark Souls, but if you relax a bit and go casual style - you lose - its just perfect!Second - I like the car physics - its way better than in GTA IV. Also a small detail - traffic goes left handed in HongKong - it is a trifle, but I don't know why it fascinates me. Feels so fresh :)Also I really like China spirit and have not much respect for American one. Yes - they all gangsters in both games, but Americans feels so empty and dumb, and Chinesse.. they have history much bigger than ours and it matters.What more to say.. I really happy that I found this game and will go continue playing ^_^P.S. I haven't completed or even played much yet, but I realized that I want to go here and write the review immediately!

												Okay so i've got Sleeping Dogs, and i came in expecting a somewhat NEW game since this is my first time buying a ""remake"" edition or whatever they call it.  The game is fun, if you don't have the actual game yet then get this 100% However, if you've already got the game, completed the game or don't have the DLC's then it's not really worth it. However this game is amazing, so i bought it anyway since i wanted to replay it. Better story than GTA in my opinion, amazing sceneary and not the old boring Americas. What i did notice, it doesn't have many customization options, clothing is bare, so are cars.			",114,7,3,9,11,1,6

												The destructible environments add to the already great combat. There are way more and varied people around in the game world and I love how they have integrated the DLC into the main game. You no longer just get a bunch of free stuff in your wardrobe and garage, you either have to buy the stuff from a special vendor or earn some of them from missions in the game. Even the Red Envelopes are now hidden packages instead of just right next to the garages like before. To me it really balances out the game much better then before. The only DLC it doesn't seem to include is the Top Dog Gold and Silver packs that let you level up, it would have been nice to have the option to use them in this version but overall I am kind of glad they are not there as that did make the old version very easy and less fun to me.The improvements are very good in this version and don't believe the people saying this game looks worse then the HD pack from the old version because that is total BS. Whatever their reason or agenda is I'm not sure, but look for yourself at real images from an impartial sight and not some jokers personal images that could be from the lowest settings or even the original game.http://tech4gamers.com/sleeping-dogs-sd-vs-sleeping-dogs-definitive-edition-graphics-comparison-and-benchmarks/ ",91,9,0,14,3,0,4

												Loved the original edition, never got back to it to grab the DLC. Picked up the 'Definitive' edition during the winter sale. Despite the glitches, bugs, and general wonkiness that can still be found I still rate it as one of my all time favorite action 'sandbox' games, falling only behind Red Dead Redemption. If you haven't played it yet, definite 'must buy' category.			",254,36,25,43,66,4,65
