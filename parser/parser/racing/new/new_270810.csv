												Despite the cats, I can't broadly recommend this. The concept is cute, the sound effects and texts are all nice, and the ""idea"" of the gameplay would be fine. However, the camera is sickeningly bad (it jerks around like nobody's business and doesn't show the important upcoming stuff). The menus are also poor, meaning you'll spend a lot of time waiting in them and clicking through them to get back to the core part of this game: the cute meow sound of picking up kittens.At a push, you might get this as a novelty gift for a cat loving friend, but it really needs some fixing-up before it's playable for any length of time.(note on playtime: I played this before on Desura because  come on saving cats is an awesome concept. I'd say I've played a total 40minutes-1 hour)			",1277,482,63,164,209,19,275

												Pure cancer.From level 9 the game forces impossible obstacles on you due to the speed increase, and when I say impossible I don't mean hard, I mean trying to walk through a wall kind of impossible.You get 2 hazards which have a very short distance between them, that forces you to touch the 2nd one by avoiding the first one - only to get pushed back behind the first one again, so you're basically dead no matter what.Don't even mind that the top upgrades purchases ask for an astronomical amount + your virginity.Only play this if you hate your mom, your girlfriend, your dog, your life, the universe and will ♥♥♥♥♥ yourself out on the streets for achievements.

												Frustrating obstacles past Hazard 9 where the game goes too fast and you cannot pass them no matter how hard you try (ex: wall + slide log). The problem isn't the fact that it goes fast (i like fast games), the problem is that it isn't involving skill, it's involving impossibility. You HAVE to jump to pass the wall, and if you jump, you stub yourself into the logs behind, you can't reach the ground to slide under it, so the level can't be completed unless you are lucky with the layout.And the game hasn't much to offer, it's just always the same scenery, and an horrible uninspired grind (it takes hours in order to be able to buy an uninspired upgrade)There are so many better endless runners, free and paying, I can't find the appeal of this one.

												A simple, fun, and occasionally frustrating game. Pluses: the art style is adorable, each run is short - success or failure - so it's easy to play in between other things, and the controls are responsive. Minuses: some obstacles are very hard to see, or don't come on screen until you've already committed to a jump to catch more kitties; lack of achievements and leader boards limits the motivation to try and do better. Unless you're into that weird ""personal improvement"" nonsense.In short: more features would be nice, but for the price it's an easy recommendation.			",1603,732,61,207,160,18,229

This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.Putting kittens into any game is going to instantly get you bonus points, but putting hundreds and hundreds of them into a game is basically a winning combination. Jones on Fire puts you in the shoes of a firefighter saving kittens from the burning blaze throughout a forest. The gameplay itself is very simple. All you need is one button, the up key. Jones is constantly moving and you cannot stop, you must jump and slide under burning objects, if you miss the jump, the wall of fire catches up to you for a bit until you can gain some ground on it. After each run through, you get the chance to spend your money, which is in turn granted by how many kittens you save. The rewards consist of straight upgrades, or one time abilities, such as cat nip, which basically attracts all the kittens to you without having to move to collect them. Each run you get three lives, at the end of the three lives you have to start again, but you don't lose all of your rewards and upgrades, these are carried over. This makes it feel like every run you are improving your character in some way. This game does the simplicity very well, there looks to be some more content on the way looking at the reward screen as there are two more sections with ""Coming Soon"" showing, so it will be interesting to see what else is added. I can definitely recommend Jones on Fire for the price that is currently set at (£1,99), I have only played for half an hour and I can see myself jumping in again to save a couple hundred more kitties!

Jonas on Fire it's a simple 2D side scrolling runner game where you have 2 buttons: jump and slide. It was originally a game designed for mobile devices, and later ported to PC version. The player's mission is to guide a firefighter along frenzied levels in flames and save the largest possible number of kittens. With this, the player will collect money and points that can later be used to purchase power-ups. Maybe a little cute concept game but nothing more. The camera is quite bad (it jerks around like nobody's business and doesn't show the important upcoming stuff). The menus are too poor, meaning you'll spend a lot of time waiting in them.The gameplay is so bland. It's just a runner game without nothing new to offer. It's just always the same scenery, and an horrible uninspired grind. With ten levels to overcome, the diversity of adventure will not much beyond what appears at first, especially with the visual scenarios. Graphically it's clearly based on Minecraft fashion that seems to have been, but the style doesn't encourage. At the same time it's a freaking jumping game - the problem isn't the speed of the game, the problem is that it isn't involving skill, it's involving impossibility and unpredictability. You have to jump to pass the flames, and if you jump, you stub yourself into the logs behind, you can't reach the ground to slide under it, so the level can't be completed. Add to this, a huge repetitive game.Jones of Fire could have been successful if it had been more ambitious but the limitations of converting a mobile game to a home console format quickly become all too obvious. While there's some fun to be had in short, quick sessions, Jones of Fire doesn't take long until it becomes too repetitive and its overall components are clearly weak to what is expected from a platform game. There are so many better runners games and free. I can't recommend this.I think this game neither as a gift for a friend would be good.			",226,74,10,8,26,0,33

												A runner game where you save kittens from a burning forest and get back to base safely. Gets challenging rather quickly, but gets repetitive just as quick. The upgrades and golden kittens just take that long to get and you don't feel like there is much of a goal other than getting to a higher ""hazard level"". Ultimately, It sucks that you need so many golden kitties for higher level temporary boosts (or permanent abilities) so that you can have a proper run - on one level at a time (because the boost wears off after 1 level).The game often asks you to tweet score for small daily bonuses and each time you press ""tweet"" it opens a new tab in your browser. I really don't like that. I'd rather get the bonus somehow else.Edit: Also, occassionally on higher difficulty levels, your mid-air slides (or even running and falling from top of a obstacle) tend to go too far because there are a lot of obstacles... this can be frustrating and kind of make it really hard to get into hazard 10+----------------It's still a fun experience and I recommend giving it a try.8/!0			",638,166,16,115,52,7,80

												Jones on Fire is a fun little time-waster with a simple yet engaging mechanic. It's accessible if you're not a superstar gamer, but definitely challenging enough for more advanced gamers (save ALL the kitties!). I played it first on iOS, and I'm delighted to be able to play it on my Mac as well. I haven’t tried setting up a controller yet, but I think that would be an even better way to play (there isn’t native support, but with a little effort it should work).I also highly recommend the sorta-sequel, Hot Tin Roof.

												Timing, timing is everything with this game. So you see a kitty hanging there? You jump to save him/her and come down. Oh no! There was a log! In this game you NEED to pay attention to where you are going and where you will land when jumping. On the gameplay side of things it's simplistic, but has that old style level runner that a lot of us grew up with as kids. Controls are simble, jump, slide, etc. Doesn't take long to learn them. Especially if you complete the tutorial in the beginning. (I recommend this) You start at hazard level 1, 2hp (Or times you can land in fire or smash into something) before you lose a life. Not to worry! You start with 3, and they appear to regen over time provided you clear a level. When the counter reaches 0, well I'm sure you can guess what happens! It is however a bit hardcore afterward as you drop back to level 1. However, unlike most games that drop you back, you retain all your perks and or upgrades you had purchased previously. This is nice, and certainly helps you continue to climb higher and higher each time you go through runs. Your only objective is simple! You run out there and rescue kitties! And depending how many you rescue, you got it! Determines your over all score for the level and how many points you earn to spend at the actual upgrade stations.Art style wise it's cute. It's not overly complex, but it doesn't look terrible either. I recommend playing the game to find out! (Music is pretty fun as well but gets slightly repetitive. Thats my personal opinion however!)

												Disclaimer: At the time of writing, most of my experience with this game is from a non-Steam version.Overall simple and fun. You collect floating kitties while avoiding logs and fire. Collect enough kitties and you can add some more variation to your capabilities. Higher levels have more kitties, and with a higher multiplier when completed. However, if you lose all your lives, you go back to level one. The highest level is 10, and the skill progression can feel a bit slow.Also, there are slight moments of darkness...why is there a never-ending forest fire and why are there so many cats out there, just floating and spinning in the air?It's probably better not to ask, just rescue as many as you can.

The more you play, the more deceptively complex it becomes; the controls are simple, but the ways in which they're used in combination with the landscape and obstacles offers a great ""just one more go"" experience.

												If you have any familiarity with making games in Unity, this is one of those games where it makes you think ""Damn, I could make this game"", but it's done so well that you want to keep playing it anyway.This is a two-button (jump/slide) auto-running platformer with skill progression (through in-game earned currency). It's all been done before, but it is done EXTREMELY well here, and the price is right. Great music, endearing graphics, and I really appreciate the female protagonist.			",291,73,12,59,39,8,35

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Parkour automatically sidescrolling platform  game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThey give you a tutorial tour if you are new to the game.You can slide the bar to change the volume to music and the sound.Music is 8-bitish.Graphics are pixelated.About the game.There are in-game challenges and if you complete them you get some extra points.You have to save kitties from the fire.You only have to press the Up arrow key or the down arrow key.You get points and you could spend them to upgrade your character or the kitties.White kitties gives white K and golden kitties gives golden K.The music is decent and it is sort of funky.You have a health bar and 3 lives. Whenever you ran out of lives then you have to spend Gold K.If you can't spend golden K to buy lives again. Then you will start all the way back to level 1 again.Upgrades and challenges will NOT be lost whenever you are restarting back to level 1.You can recover a health bar by outrunning the fire wall.Game is very easy to understand and to pickup.The Parkour will be changed whenever you have died on the level. Other things.Jones is a girl...Mew :3-------------------I Give this game a 7/10 ",462,169,6,45,48,1,62

												Side scrolling runner game. Has all the markings of a mobile port (""premium"" currency, 3 objectives, daily quests, social media integration). Not that any those those are a bad thing. But the core gameplay is, well, bland. It's just a run of the mill, runner game with nothing new to offer. Not challenging at all, after about 5-10 minutes of playing I was able to pass the levels with no mistakes. There's only 3 obstacles ffs, 2 you jump over and 1 you slide (or jump) over, meaning you can play the entire game with just the Up key, which is, well.. boring. This game isn't terrible by any means, but it's not great either; it's average at best, mediocre at it's worst.Worth Checking Out? Probably not, unless you really like runner games.Likeliness of Being Bundled? Medium to HighPrice to pay? >$1			",1216,285,54,126,121,12,160

												It's in the category of Endless runners. it has a simple premise Run from wild fire and save kitties. Its a fun little time waster. You can even buy upgrades with the kitties you save. They also have little missions you can do for more kitties to buy more powerups.			",613,210,9,122,44,3,55

												Super easy mechanics, and fun. I almost gave up until I realized there is not a perfect game Jones on Fire, that's the point. Try and try again to save as many kitties as possible, and who doesn't want to save kitties? I was suprired I like it as much as I do. It's great for a 10 minute break.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really enjoy this game. It's not very long and I don't see much replay ability if that is what you look for in games...but it is mostly relaxing with a few challenging areas. Pretty easy to get cheevos in too. The art style is pretty cool, and I didn't have any issues as far as bugs or freeze-ups, etc...it's not a bad little game.			",215,42,0,30,10,1,13

												Simplistic, stereotypical, yet, also entertaining.This game is just super cute in its own little way, analogizing to Jetpack Joyride with its constant fast-paced action game, or Temple Run's classic past-time activity. Or just even compare to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Flappy Bird. It may look like I'm just comparing only somewhat similar games, but what they all have in common is that certain types of feeling you experience while playing the game.This game seemed to be suited for people who like classic, or even just small-looking Phone games. [Specifically to people who fall for cute kitties!]Pros:Fun, time-waster.Gets more challenging as one progresses, so it doesn't get bland quicklyKitties! Lots and lots of Kitties for you!It also appeals to your Pathological emotion, when you lose all of those lives, not being able to save those kitties ahead, you always got infinite second chances, no matter how much you have to walk on flaming logs and slide through flames![* Powerups!]Cons:I had this on a seperate account, and I remember that:The only problem I had with this game was 'shortness', this game just needed a few game modes, I mean, once you get all the power ups, [takes a while] and also all the other items, thats where it actually seems to get bland at, because there isn't much to do after that.

												I bought this game beacause the witcher II gived me a 20% sale off ticket, and it was fun in the very begining.But there is a only way to play this game.Just keep running and avoiding all stupid slumber or fire or more annoying slumber.I have to admit cats are really nice and the sound effects are cute.But it's just too easy and I get really tiered about this.But there are the achivements I can not give up.I have to keep palying.It's really painful to collecte the cat, beacause you only can collecte 5000 cats and 50 golden cats in around(maybe just beacause I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ so I can only collecte this.I don't know.).But if you wanna get the achivements.Trust me, It will take you a lot of time.And I don't know, have this company concidered to put this in ipad?This game is too time wasting:(			",49,44,1,15,4,0,2

												This game does what it was meant to do so in that way it was a success... however it is a repetitive side running game which seems to be ported from an app.Basically its cute but a tad boring. If you like a super casual games then go for it... though Im really only going to play to finish off the achievemts and woudnt play it otherwise. (Basically Im just being too nice to not recommend it)If you like cats then that might help... If you are bad at games and like setting cats on fire then this might be the best game you have ever played. Each to their own.			",157,118,0,20,11,1,13

												Overall a pretty simplistic game. Not worth 3 bucks or whatever it goes for normally, but if you get it on sale and sell the trading cards, it's about a net loss of 30 cents, and it's worth that. It's structured kind of like a mobile game in that it has an in game social media function, currencies, and a simple, 2 button game mechanic. These, however, do not take away from the fun of the game.Regardless, if you like cats or know someone who likes cats, it's worth the 30 cents for a giggle or 2 and the righteous feeling of saving felines.
