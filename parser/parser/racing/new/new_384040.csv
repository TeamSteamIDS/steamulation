												Played with bots 10 minutes...mehPlayed with wife 10 minutes... she rage quitPlayed with brother 10 minutes... he rage quit Played with both of them over 3,5 hours... pricelessGraphic is very colorful on black background, really enjoyable and catchy for an eye.Music is ok, it doesent get borring in time, you probably wont even hear it from yelling and laughing with friends.It doesent have online multiplayer, and it really dont need it. Its perfect game to play with friends and family at home.With fair price, i recommend this to everyone who have social life as MUST BUY.So what are you waiting for, buy it, call your friends to bring pizza and beer and have fun ^^			",883,335,29,105,143,8,107

												I bought this game not expecting it to have the control system it has but it works surprisingly well.  Playing on gamepad acceleration is achieved by continuously tapping away at the A button to maintain speed and then steering controlled via rotation using left and right on the analogue stick.  It feels a bit like racing on ice at times but works considerably well as a party-style game.

There are a good variety of tracks and an even greater variety of game modes.  The video above is of pass-the-bomb mode which can be a used as a short chaotic break from racing.If you have two or more friends to play locally with and enjoy easy to pick up racing games then Impulse revolution is a no-brainer.

												Warning, this game is addictive. If you like your fingers I would advise against playing it but holy crap is it fun. It is one of the best couch games ever in my humble opinion. Grab a couple friends, a few spare controllers and set aside an evening. There is enough variance in the maps and game modes, with some of the most creative and unique ideas I've encountered in a long time in a game of this type.As fun as the game is there are a couple of downsides, it is incredibly taxing on your hands and fingers, and is best played in short bursts as the method of propulsion requires rapidly tapping the keys or buttons. The lack of online multiplayer hurts it as well but for £5 the bots will provide plenty of entertainment as they are sufficiently challenging ",151,21,3,14,18,2,15

												A fun and frantic cyber racing game with lots and lots of choices... game types, weapon choices and numerous ways to win! Cant wait to get some friends together and play this on the big screen :D			",133,3,2,18,7,2,27

												Read it wrong and thought it was regular (online) mulitplayer. Turns out to be local only. Fun game but gets old real quick playing against bots. Would recommend if it had online multiplayer.			",103,39,5,3,13,0,2

												This game is really fun! I really like the costomize option of the puck your racing! What i think you should add is online multiplayer cause its hard for so many hands on one keyboard to control the pucks and it will be fun to skype with people while racing! I also suggest adding a control options on keys to fire cause sometimes the fire key is too far away or is too hard to reach! This game has alot of modes too so you can never get bored with so many options! Highly Recommend! But please add online multiplayer! :)			",38,1,2,0,4,0,0

												Impulse Revolution is a game about racing through tracks.. probably..This game is great for 4 local player to play on.. I dont have anything to say.. just gonna list all the good and bad thing this game have to offerPros:-Can be play up to 4 player either on controller or keyboard (yes, it support up to 4 player on keyboard)-5 different game modes giving you some variety to play-16 different track -Can add so many bots on a few modes -tournament mode up to 4 players-Simple to control and easy to understand.. anyone can play..-Really colourful graphics :DCons-You cant change control (which is bad for laptops)-Can get old quickly if you dont have friends.. even you have friends.. the variety is pretty limited-no workshop or mods support-no level editor-just dont be mad with your friends..Overall.. with the price it asking.. i recommend you to pick it up! The game is worth every pennyWarning: This game is no online mode and probably never will have.. The dev said that it is require netcode to get online working and none of them know how to do that.

												Try the demo. There are a lot more tracks and game options in the actual game but the demo gives a good feel of the controls and lets you try a couple modes on one track you can try it mp so its worth testing out before buying.			",271,14,47,4,6,7,16
