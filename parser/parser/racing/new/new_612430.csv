												I can only speak to the solo part of the game so far, but as far as that goes, I like it. You control two characters at once, which makes this a pretty difficult platformer in my eyes. Your right hand controls one character, and your left the other. In one of the levels I've beaten, you have to dodge an enemy with one character, while moving the other character through obstacles... You'll die. A lot.As far as multiplayer goes, I fiddled around with it, and it looks like an extremely promising party game. However, the only downside I see is that you'd have to have a few controllers at your disposal to make this enjoyable for some game modes. I plan to play this next time I'm with a group of friends, and will update the review accordingly. With a $5 price tag, I'd recommend it. I recieved the key from the dev, but I've paid $5 for FAR less content.I raged quite a bit, but I'm having fun playing it. Gameplay below if you're interested.
