												Whatever you do, do not pay for this ""game"". If i sat in my chair for the next 12 minutes and I did nothing, It would be far more fun and productive than if played this game. Steam should not offer content like this. It makes me think they just want to scam me out of my money.			",1,0,2,0,4,0,1

												Dont buy. This game looks like a crappy port of a Mobile game that was developed in less then a week. A.I. Brain dead, Game more then likely stole assets, And physics are too drifty in circuit races. Here's a video I made on it.

												Not worth the money so i'm glad i got it free... There's only 5 cars.. It says it has a ""smart and dangerous A.I"" but no the A.I is crap and the driving physics is way too drifty for a racing game.			",145,27,5,23,10,1,10

												This can't be the final product, it' just bad.. - AI is dumb - Physics needs a lot of work- Car sounds are bad (especially the turbo, it's annoying)- Only 4 cars- No Controller - Tuning is nice thoBUT with some work it can be turned into a playable game.			",113,29,10,17,10,0,8

												Expected.As soon as I saw the trailer, I knew that this game wouldn't be all that good. It had bad controls as it focuses on drifting above everything else but can't even handle drifting well, it wasn't thrilling and the maps did absolutely nothing to interest me, they were so unoriginal and far too simple. I enjoy racing games for the way they can be exciting, but this one was the exact opposite. It was boring. The fact that this game isn't free is stupid.Do I recommend this game? No.			",22,11,3,2,2,1,0

												Good game, Funny af, physics need some work but fckin good, the game got released 1week ago or something like that, if you search fun, with a bit of difficulty buy it! I like the customisation setting.Same with body, and rims.The whole game is good expect some work to do on physics but its 50% good.Carreer mode is insame.If you want chill you got a freeroam mode.Need to add more cars.Good game buy it!

												So one main problem right now? No controller support! why do people make racing games and not give them controller support on release? Other than that its ok at the moment, does need alot of work though.			",41,2,9,2,9,0,2

												It's strangely addictive and totally recommended for fans of PS2 era racers. It just needs controller support and a few bug fixes/updates. I think younger gamers will be put off by the arcade style physics and OG aesthetic, but if you're into the old NFS games this should be worth a look.			",117,2,2,6,3,1,2
