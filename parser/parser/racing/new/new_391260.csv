												I just stayed up until almost 2 AM to finish this game, and I wasn't disappointed. Essentially, if you love retro JRPGs, you'll enjoy this. Game play is standard turn-based, abilities are gained by exploration, there are TONS of items to pimp out your characters, and the ending is pretty solid. As far as negatives go, the writing is average, I'd say (the love story could have been fleshed out to great effect), and some of the puzzles seemed a tad glitchy. The labyrinths teeter on the line of challenging and rage-quit inducing, individual players may vary on how they feel about it. You don't get other playable characters until later in the game, though your main character is pretty beastly on his own. On the whole, I really enjoyed this game; it reminded me in the best ways of the early Final Fantasy games, and I can't wait to play the sequel!			",249,125,2,68,21,2,45

												WARNING!KEYBOARD USERS, keyboard is currently ded, only controller, if you don't have a controller, avoid this at all cost! Even if it cost $1.94! Looks like it's fixedWhy I recommend it☑ Price☑ Beautiful tiles or map's textures☑ Nice sound track☑ Lot's of labyrinths☑ Nice storyIt's an RPG-maker game, but this is an amazing game, you get it? a-maze-ing, ahueheuheuheuehuehue, ok nvm. You get the idea of how the game function with rpg maker, so I wont elaborate.Now the cons, tl;drIt's very time consumingAfter the intro, you are allowed to roam around the world, basically your mission is to collect all four elemental stones. The thing is, there are paths that are not accessible unless you have certain items (e.g. pickaxe, someone's weapon), but the game doesn't hint you where to get it, so this make the game much much more tougher, because it doesn't encourage you to explore the world, it forces you to. Without a map, some maps are just tooooooo huge to explore randomly, most of my time, and probably yours, will be spent on figuring out where in the map you are.			",652,248,14,83,75,5,116

												Overall a pretty solid RPG Maker game. The main complaints that I have so far are that quite a few of the puzzles are inscrutible, and it's never very clear exactly where you're supposed to be going or what you're supposed to be doing at any given time. All you can find out is where you SHOULDN'T be, which is usually discovered by getting killed by a monster in 2 hits. Quite a few of the midgame maps are HUGE, and you can easily get completely lost.The story is also likely to be a bit hit or miss with some people. Most of it is uncovering the background, both for the world, and your character, and the plot bits tend to be pretty far apart.. And the majority of text was clearly written by someone who is not a native English speaker. It sort of bounces between extremely simple English, simple English with words used wrong, and bizarrely stilted, awkward writing. Things like ""Do not forget these words when the urge to start moving is awakened in you."" and ""North from here, a land of water reigns. Maybe it's just me, but I feel kind of quenched everytime I'm in the hood."" And that's just in the first 5 minutes of play.Still, if you can look past the flaws, it's a solid, challenging, old-school RPG with a lot of depth and content, and a low price tag.

												This is a terrible game. Absolutely awful. I can't believe I finished it.I like retro games. I have a lot of nostalgia for SNES era RPGs. But those games relied on their stories to make up for their lack of expressive graphics. Whereas here the art and sound are maybe the only positives for Labyronia. The music was solid. The visuals are decent. And the special effects can be quite good.But the story. The writing. The game system. The grinding. The backtracking. The mazes. All abysmal.There's no plot. Go collect four crystals. Gee, never seen that before.Despite the fact that this is a party game with up to three characters for you to play as you'll have only a single character for the first 95% of the game. The second and third come in time for the final dungeon. That's it.Getting to the end is the biggest chore. You have to grind in order to move forward. At least 2-3 hours of my 12 hour playthrough was grinding. It's bad planning. You can do the math for the system so that's not required.Even figuring out where to go next is basically impossible. The overworld does not have a lot of clues. There is no journal, no list of quests or an objective. That would be fine if the way to move forward made any sort of logical sense, but it doesn't.The dungeon/labyrinth design is the worst part of it all. They infinitely wrap around on themselves, so you have no idea where you're oriented within one. I spent several hours just wandering around, lost. This is a stupid problem to have in a game. There's no reason for it. Simply putting an edge on the map and not making them wrap would've helped immensely, and been way more believable physically.On top of that, there's no faster form of travel than walking until the very end. And of course, you have to do massive amounts of backtracking in order to move forward. But this is not explicitly stated anywhere. Finding the key items needed to progress is a futile endeavor. You can spend many many hours with no idea what you're supposed to do. Your only recourse is to revisit every location. It's beyond frustrating.I can't believe this game made it through play testing as designed. I would've sent it back to the drawing board.			",204,74,1,29,4,2,23

												Okay !!! After quite an extensive run and being stuck at the moment ( and refusing any outside help). I thought it might eb a good idea to write a review of this game as a sort of catharsis after hat I went through.First thing first, if I had to describe Labyronia, I'll say that the game lives up to its namesake, because this is a god damn MAZE !!! No really, I've never felt that lost in a game, you'll spend hour trying to figure out the exit of an area with no reliable way to keep track on where you're going. You'll bash your head in frustration on your keyboard and pray David Bowie to get you out of here, but the only thing you'll get will be an ankward glare from your roommate. To make the matter worse, this game really likes backtracking ... and it'll make sure that you must return multiple time in the same location to get in a SPECIFIC area (odds are that you'll find it randomly most of the time). Devs say they took inspiration from pokemon for their game. That statement is quite true, type advantage is key for winning battles in this game. They even brought you memorable feature from Pokemon such as ""the run in a cave without Flash with Zubats everywhere"". Unfortunately, no escape rope or dig, which I think would have been great features in this game considering the lenght of certain dungeons without a shortcut to the exit when done ( from what I've seen you get a blimp later on in the game, but you'll have to get through 8 hours of walking to get that reward, and I hope you can actualy use it to fast travel the world map).An other thing regarding the battle system and which pained me is that it seems that some fights are neraly impossible without a specific item or spell. And I'm not talking about quest item or plot spell ! No I'm taling about easely missable features that will bite you in the ♥♥♥ later if you don't have them for the battle. A sound exemple will be for the Chimera, if you go unprepared, you'll find that this fight is impossible no matter how much you try because of one ability that prevent your character from doing anything during the fight (you're bloody petrify). Of course there is only one way to go around that ability, but it's NOT in the dungeon ! No it's some special boots that make you immune to stunt and petrify ailments and are sold by only one merchant that happened to be on the other side from where you standing, and that you came by 2 hours ago !!! Needless to say, the reason if I'm currently stuck in the game is because I just happened to bump into another creature like that; and I can't defeat it because somehow I missed again the missable item that I need to beat it ( and it's not even a boss !! ) .Other than that, I'll say battle are pretty challenging and rewarding when you do have the key elements needed, ennemies actions are not randomize but follow a pattern of actions that they repeat over and over in the same order, alloing you to play around these actions to take minimal damages from punishing blow while destroying your opponent when his guard is open.Now regarding the story, so far there is not much exposition, which is a good thing ! The story is your to discover through books and dialogues which are quite extensive and well written ( despite some being forced and cringe worthy, trust me you'll understand me when you get to the desert level). Unfortunately I've failed so far to find the main character interesting ( granted I don't find him annoying and it's kind of reflreshing to have a mature man for a lead character), I feel like the dev were focusing to much on his backstory ( which is great)  to give him actual character traits, so far none that he'd displayed stroke me as memorable and some were kind of contradicting themselve ... I don't have much to say about the supportive cast considering I've not seen much of them for now, just that I recruited my first party member after 7 hours of gameplay which is kinda long, and it seems like you have to a GLORIOUS amount of backtracking in past areas if you want to unlock new power for them (and again there is no way to tell if any of them is going to prove MANDATORY in the future).Now despite, all the backlashes, I still don't hate this game, it's like dark souls playing with your nerves and pushing you to the limit of self-destruction. It's quite remarkable that I'm still able to enjoy a game that frustrating. To be honest, the game is quite well made for an RPG Maker game. Sure it doesn't go overboard and use it's own sprite our illustration (hell even that thumbnail for the game lokks like vergil from Dmc ) but it's still quite charming with the world their proposing.To top it off, the game is not expensive at all, you'll have a run for your money so no reason for not buying it.

												Not a genre that I usually play, but I find myself keep getting drawn back to Labyronia RPG. Really nice, simple graphic design helps (I understand that this is a RPG Maker game) and a fantasy storyline that for reasons that I can't explain has just got me hooked. 360 controls work really well and save games are frequent so you never have to replay huge chunks of game when you die. The English is a little shaky here and there which is rather charming. Price is very generous so there is really no reason not to buy if you are a fan of the genre or want some fantasy story-based gaming.			",360,81,17,31,59,8,50

												First of all, im a huge Fan of Games made with the Rpg-Maker.So when i saw this on sale for a couple of cents and read the positive reviews i thought, ""Yeah lets try it.""Huge Disappointment.Graphic: Its not a problem that its just the Rpg-Maker-Style, some may find it plain ugly, some (like me) just consider it retro and like it. The problem here is that the assets used are basically all the assets you see in every other RPG-Maker game. Plain, boring, overused and uninspired.Story: its thin as paper, unoriginal and boring. The stuff that was already boring 15 years ago. 4 Elements 4 Cristals Gods destroy earth blablabla *falls asleep*Music: the music is propably the best part about this game, classic tones you expect from a RPG of this kind but still niceGameplay: classic retro JRPG is what you get, nothing not to like. Yet still its just the standart fighting system from the RPG-Maker, which you can find in thousands of other RPG-Maker Games.This is what leads me to my conclusion, if you dont like classic JRPG's then dont buy this game, if you DO like classic JRPG'S still dont buy this game (not even for 29 cents) since there are RPG-Maker games out there that are tremendously better than this pile of below-mediocracy and are available FOR FREE.I would love to see the RPG-Maker-Community getting more attention, but not through meh games like this.(If you want to try a commercial one i advise you to look at To the Moon on Steam or just google one of the various Rpg-Maker-Sites for free ones)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would definitely recommend Labyronia, it is not without issues but these are far outweighed by its successes. The combat, world, and addiction to levelling your character are all very solid. Reminding me of Mystic Quest(one of the old FF games, renamed for some reason... I think). So far I've yet to pick up any companions but there is space for two by the look of it, will be nice when I finally get one. Much of the combat and movement around the world feels refreshing fast compared to the old games of this type, falling somewhere in between those and Half minute Hero. Far less random encounters hindering your progress and far less long battles for little XP reward, all plus points in my view.The controls are a little bit counter intuitive when played with an Xbox 360 pad, walking done via the left thumb stick and the menu's etc done via the D-Pad. You get used to this quickly and in some ways it actually adds to the retro feel but I would like the option of doing it all on one.The enemies lack animation, though all magics and attacks have nice effects representing them, the werewolf warp effect being one to avoid if you have a problem with strobes. For £2 or less this is to be expected, asset creation is extremely time intensive and every frame of animation pretty much doubles the load, hopefully enough people will buy this to give them both the incentive and the capital to address this in future releases.All in all Labyronia is well worth the asking price for anyone wanting a solid slice of retro style JRPG action!

Basic InformationTitle:  Labyronia RPGDeveloper:  LabyrinthinePublisher:  Epic Quest GamesGenre:  Classic-style RPGGeneral ImpressionLabyronia RPG is a visually pleasant game that despite using some assets from RPG Maker as well as several new ones, also manages to provide us with an original and entertaining story and likeable characters. The game world is quite large and offers enough terrain and random encounter diversity, that it offsets the time wasted on grinding to a decent level. There are also many quests which never seem repetitive and rewards that make it all worth it. Labyronia is by now a succesful RPG series in its own right thanks to a correct asking price and captivating story.Strong Points+ Excellent storyline and plenty of quests.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- Difficult start which requires too much grinding.Rating 7/10 This review was submitted for SUPER Giveaways.

												Wow! Simply WOW! I'm going to be honest here. The dev posted a competition claiming whoever beat the game first would win 300$. Now I'm not sure if that is true or not but at this point I really don't care!!! This game was fantastic!!! The game introduces a ""Cue"" sytem which when examining objects will give you new spells and skills. The story had me pleasantly suprised. Not super on edge or anything but I still thought it was pretty good. Another thing I really enjoyed about this game was the soundtrack. Not sure how they did it but I thought it was really well done. If I had to make a complaint about the game it would be that A lot of the ""cues"" you find early on you can't use because you don't have the corresponding party member. Other than that I had absolutely no gripes with this game. If you love Old School RPG's definitely pick this up! At a price of 1-3$ it's absolutely a steal. I mean I got 14 hours out of it for 2$ LOL!!			",596,77,6,68,17,3,48

												For the price of Labyronia RPG, is a fun game made with RPG Maker. Good story and easy to follow. Basically, the 4 Gods of Labyronia created labyrinths with a magical pendant that caused a bunch of monsters to appear. Arres, who is a very talented mage, sets out to see why this was done and if he can put a stop to it. Along the way to save the ""world"" you will encounter all sorts of enemies that will try to stop you.After the Intro you are forced to explore the world. But it helps you learn the map and know where to go quickly. Lots of puzzles / labyrinths to solve. Good music and map texture. The game will open in a small window size but you can ALT + ENTER on the keyboard to run any game or program in fullsreen mode and it works here.I normally watch people play these RPG games.

Labyrinths and a story that surprisesEnter a realm in which mortals played gods, and ultimately failed.Graphics: Ø The graphics aren't surprising, and they are standard - but they are even in their ""enlarged"" state not ugly and not unsightly.Sound: Ø Quite standard fare for a RPGMaker game. Nothing outstanding, but also nothing too annoying.Playability: + The game has some traps laid out, but those actually make the game work perfect in all other areas. The traps are, spots were a low level character can get killed too easily... so take care, and play through the game. I encountered no bugs... some minor typos and a game that ran smoothly and without even once crashing - and I tried hard to get it crashing... No chance at this. You can't save everywhere in the game which actually isn't bad at all. And encounters are often visible on the maps (only not on the world map).Genre Values:Story: ++ You play Arres a Battlemage with no history at all, and as shrouded as your history is your future and your abilities. You start off trying to know more about your surroundings, and you learn about the monsters invading all the lands - and about the labyrinths which were created by the four elemental gods. The story is well executed, not too nosy and you choose the pace in which you will do your duties. Leveling: + You don't gain powers automatically by rising up a level or by just grinding enough monsters to gather EP's you have to search and look for your powers and it is easy to lose track of powers or even imagine what powers there are in the game for you. This is good, since some spells open up new tactics and new possibilities to get your foes more readily vanquished.Immersion: + Though the game has simple graphics, you can lose yourself in the game. I started to play it and suddenly five hours were gone - most of this effect is derived from the nice story of the game. You just want to know what is your next step, where to go next - why are the people of one city so damn aloof, while in another town you are taken in with a lot of respect. The story uncovers over time your own story, and this makes the game a nice experience. Even grinding is by far not as enervating as you might expect.Overall Rating: 5 + Alone on this I can say that I was positively surprised by the game, first it's under one buck to buy the game. Depending on how forced you play it, you might solve the game in between 10 to 20 hours, a lot of tripple A games with a lot of fancy graphics but a bad storyline offer less to a much higher price, or spread their contents over several editions of the game. The game isn't the invention of the tyre, but it is decent, nice to play and offering some neat entertainment.Value for Money: High at 0,99 The game offers at least 10 hours of game time, a good story and stable gameplay, all this for a really low price. Recommended, especially for JRPG Fans and RPG Fans in general.As I said, the gamedeveloper didn't invent the tyre new, but he tried to deliver a game that runs without killing your time in waste. The only thing that troubled me was the story between Arres and Ann... Huh? You wan't to know? Buy the game... NOW... You'll see it's fun, especially to read the awkward situation between the Hero and his Heroine... maybe a bit cheesy... but still fun. ***Remark: No cheese was harmed during writing this Review***			",1553,810,51,244,215,11,264

												Wanted to like this game, but I found myself completely unable to get into it. Most of the flaws I hit in my short attempt to play were all minor things... but there's just so many small things that they added up. -Remapping the controls is confusing. There's no actual ""Options"" menu on the main screen (which is baffling to me), so you need to know to hit F1 to remap. And once you do get into it, you find that the keyboard has multiple keys mapped to the same letter, all which seem to be based off the old Sega Genesis Turbo controllers.-Using a controller (at least a X-box one) is awkward. You use the control stick to move, but you can't use it to select options in menus, so you have to constantly swap between D-pad and the stick. Button options also felt odd, and took a couple remapping attempts to feel comfortable for me.-The game starts with a scroll of text that's basically: Monsters wrecked the world. Humanity wussed out. Mages fought and lost. And then you find yourself playing as some guy who wakes up and decides he's going to solve the problem 50-years after it started. But you have no idea who he is, other than he ""knows magic"". And by ""knows magic"" I mean he has a heal and that's it. But they give the impression shortly in that you're supposed to be some super well known battle-mage.-Monsters go from being your difficulty level (40ish dmg a hit) to well outside your ability (300+ dmg a hit) with no real signal. You'll walk half a screen away from a easy battle to find yourself getting bashed in the face and hoping to get away.-Edit-Gave it a bit more time (3 hours) hoping something would change. All it's done is let me find more flaws and lessen my opinion even more.-Area maps are, for lack of a better word, round. What I mean by this is you walk into a forest and there is a sign there to tell you it's the entrance. Great! You then decide to go left... and left some more. You end up back at the entrance. Same with if you head up, down, right, doesnt matter. If you head in 1 direction, you wrap around and end up back where you started. And given that theres no map key, you find exploring becomes more of a pain in the ♥♥♥ than the adventure it should be. It's also completely illogical.-Mob/debuff balance doesnt exist. There are debuff combos that will lock you out of the ability to act and, if RNG is against you, you can go from 100% to dead without being able to attack. And not even against overly strong monsters either. It happened to me against mobs that I had killed in 2 swings in the encounter right before.-The ""key items"" have no story presence. The goal of the game as far as I can tell at this point, seems to be based around collecting 4 elemental cores. So you would think these cores are hugely important to the world, right? Wrong. The first core has a Guard blocking you way that wont move until you do a quest for the town's leader. You finish the quest and get a letter giving you permission to go anywhere in the city. You use it to pry the god damn gem from the monument in the center of town and walk away without anyone caring (except 1 random NPC who seems VERY nervous about what he saw). And it isnt even like a ""Hey you helped our leader, take this very important gem as our thank you!"". You do the quest for the leader and they tell you to get the hell away from them and not come back.-3 hours into the game... still no party members. Not even temporary ones. -3 hours into the game... still no backstory on the hero. No plot points, no foreshadowing, nothing.-3 hours into the game... still no STORYLINE. At all. There's no explaination (aside from a 2 second ""Guess I'll save the world since no one else can"" at the VERY start) on why you're doing what you're doing, or why no one else is fighting. No explaination on why if the world is filled with this powerful destruction causing monsters that theres little villages everywhere without walls or soldiers or graveyards.After spending 3 hours I've gone from thinking this game was at best a 2/10 to not even being worth the $2 I spent on it during a sale. I've gone from hoping the company continues making games (because I really like the genre) but focus more on story, to hoping they never attempt another RPG again.In short, not only can I not recommend the game, I strongly advise people to stay away from it even if they offer if for 90% off. Hell I wouldn't even suggest people get it if it becomes free, because it's not worth the memory even if you have 4TB of free space left.			",75,13,0,16,5,0,13

												As an RPGmaker game, you really can't expect to have the best graphics and screen resolution. But you can expect some very imaginative storylines which can drive them to be good, regardless of the graphics or the program it was built upon. While this has a good storyline and some nice music, I don't really care for the battle system. Now mind you, I have nothing against RPGmaker games, I just tend to shy away from most of them. I guess it's a personal preference thing, but I've never really got into games like Final Fantasy and the Dragon Quest series, which is what this game is inspired by.So basically, the 4 Gods of Labyronia created labyrinths with a magical pendant that caused a bunch of monsters to appear. Arres, who is a very talented mage, sets out to see why this was done and if he can put a stop to it. Along the way to save the ""world"" you will encounter all sorts of enemies that will try to stop you.( I got wrecked on the second fight cause I suck at this lol). When you die you will be returned to the main title screen where you'll have to start a new game or load from a previously saved game. In order to improve your skills and whatnot, you will have to find certain objects around the world (cues). This can be anything that looks out of the ordinary, a ""weird looking stone for example"" (Ibiz).Why do I still recommend this game? Because I like the story, and I'm sure others will too. Besides, I really can't fault the game for it not being my style, nor can I fault it for not liking the battle system.			",258,65,4,11,40,2,19

												I really enjoyed this game. The story (no spoilers from me) was quite well thought out & also well written. The store page will give a rough outline about the games plot.It is a RPG Maker game, which i know will make some people will immediately ignore it, but if u don't mind the art & music of RPG Maker games u should give this a shot.It features exploration, turn-based-battles, & some puzzle sections usually of the maze/ labyrinth type.It took me just over 20hrs to finish the game & i used a guide for most parts (link below) as i found it easy to get lost & not know what to do next, but that's just my weakness, lol.Labyronia has 6 Achievements as well as Trading Cards.Again, the strong part for me was the story & i'll eventually play Labyronia 2 to see what happens next, although i don't think it's mandatory to get proper enjoyment out of the 1st Labyronia game.6/10.The (excellent) guide i used, written by aquatorrent:

												Labyronia RPG is a type of game I have not ever played before. It is based off the orginal Final Fantasy games and it reminds me of the old Pokemon/Zelda graphics. In the game you play as Arres a battle mage and you explore the world of Labyronia to find magic crystals , learn magic and beat dragons. A typical RPG set up of leveling up and gaining armor and equipment to help you get through the game. A labrynth game with lots of puzzles simaliar to the old Zelda game. This game definantly took some getting use to... searching for what to do and need while being attacked by random monsters then... sometimes dying and having to do it all over again. If you like these type of RPG's then sure, this game is good for running around to catchy music and trying to figure out just how to get through this puzzle to obtain that magic crystal to beat that boss. Fun and new, with lots of help on the forums from all the others that got stuck were you are. The community is very helpful. Only down side(s) is no blood, dying means restarting and It seems imposible to beat with out looking up at some point on what to do.			",77,12,0,17,2,0,18

												DISCLAIMER: I was given a key for free by the publisher!Labyronia RPG is a classic 16-bit era style RPG made with RPGMaker using default assets. While this may be a turn off reason for some people out there, it would be shame to pass on an actually fun to play little game that gives a lot for it's small price tag.From the beginning on you are free to explorer the world map, where you will have random encounters. Only in the dungeons or Labyrinth you will be able to see the enemies and random encounters will be turned off; oh and don't expect those to be push-overs. Strategy and use of abilities (basically magic spells, which you will have to find in the world by exploring is crucial to victory, so don't expect to kill the first foes you encounter by simply just relying on your attack ability.

												Disclosure: Received review copyRpgMaker game that has a somewhat classical JRPG setting but does things differently by having a world that is literally a labyrinth. For me this is a hard game to review as i must confess classical JRPG games with all their clichés dont have a chance in my eyes with their worn out mechanics and this game comes close to this category. So is it different enough? Yes, so it seems after some hours of gameplay. The most defining feature of the game is the Map of the world that is literaly a labyrinth. Lots of back tracking and figuring out routes.  Combat is hard and there is lots of it once you start to explore the world map and lots of grinding for experience. Game has a tendency to show you that you just took a wrong turn by sending unbeatable monsters in your way.  Many monsters will hit you with status attacks and kill you. It also goes the other way around and this makes combat one of the better designed feature in the game. Abilities are learned with 'cues' that are scattered around the map. Books can be found during the travels that explain the story. Pretty straightforward actually. I am really on the fence with this game. It is a new kind of blast from the past with a hardcore heart built on a old game engine. Buyer beware. Look closely to what you are about to buy before getting this. There is nothing casual about this title so prepare for a tough adventure where no one holds your hand and tells what to do.  ",775,311,45,87,97,7,148

Review - Labyronia RPG""It's a nice and cheap RPG game made from RPG Maker.""Labyronia RPG is a classic RPG adventure game made from the RPG Maker. As the main protagonist, your main objective is to retrieve the pendant of Labyronia in order to save and reunite the realm of Labyronia. The game gives a very nostalgic vibe to avid RPG gamers especially to those who have played the classic Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest series. The game features the traditional turn-based battle system and also the classic on-field puzzles that you need to finish in order to progress the main story. The game also features a mix of different monster encounter designs throughout the game. You encounter actual monsters roaming on the dungeon maps while you also encounter random monster battles on the world map.Labyronia RPG is a decent and good RPG game but the only problem I see is the merciless AI of the monsters. There will be times that you'll encounter and battle a set of monsters that will take you down with a series of attacks without giving you a chance to at least make a move. I don't know if the developers did it on purpose but there will be times that it can be a bit frustrating to players especially in cases when you're trying to strengthen your character and you accidentally bump into that annoying set of monsters.Still, I recommend this game to big fans of classic Adventure RPG games. The game would even be worth more if you can get it during a sale although it's already cheap.Personal Rating:Gameplay: 7/10Graphics: 6/10Story/Plot: 7/10Music: 8/10Overall: 7/10			",99,66,2,18,11,3,15

												I really wasn't expecting this game to be any good. Taking into consideration that Labyronia RPG is designed using the RPG Maker VX Ace Engine (which is available to buy on steam), I was really surprised on how well everything seemed to flow. The only thing that mainly sucked was how long it took to get other party members. Oh yeah, and how randomly unobvious it was to get to new locations at times. Although doing that certainly spikes the difficulty in one aspect, the needle in a haystack approach can only grab someone's attention and intelligence for so long. Labyrinthine got really close to crossing the line in that regard. But they didn't. On a more positive note, the gameplay (very typical turn-based combat with familiar JRPG abilities) and how you acquire new skills (cues) by actioning different objects is cool. I thought the story was interesting too. There were some really subtle elements that dive deep into spiritualized ecological understandings. You play as a bearded wonderer (Arres) who doesn't know who he is the entire game. Near the end he speaks with Ibiz and THEN his destiny and means to defeat the Demigods (although they're referred to as Gods) is more clearly revealed. The story is somewhat intricate, but essentially Arres is destined to collect the 4 elemental crystals. And he needs to kick a lot of ♥♥♥ in order to do that and restore balance to the world. It's...very typical...but not bad! Over all, I think this game is a pretty fun experience if you keep an open mind. It's certainly interesting to see a new breed wanting to experiment, progress, and gain credibility throughout the JRPG community. I'm curious to see if Labyrinthine is going to take some bigger leaps forward because the capability to do so is definitely there! Over all, great work!			",35,5,0,6,1,0,2

												If you've played the old Final Fantasy titles, Shining Force, or old school RPGs - this game will feel very nostalgic. It gives the same sense of reward for being attentive, thorough, and patient. I finished it in one go, split between 2 days. Was it a game worth the time? Definitely. Otherwise I wouldn't have put in the hours. Was it a game worth for the price? (I paid half because it was on sale) Yes. Easily 18+ hours if you're a fan of puzzles and exploration.But be warned, if you're the kind who likes being spoon fed on where to go and being strung along on every game mechanic - this game is not for you.This game literally throws you in with no tutorial. There is a story that progresses, but its minor and most of the time you'll be too preoccupied on trying to find just that small bit of information, or clue, to help you proceed. The story itself isn't polished. I myself cringed at a few script dialogues and cliched instances. But it is one that was unique in its own and one that carried me towards the end.Overall, it is a good game for its price and the effort put into it. Just don't expect Square Enix level of content because it isn't. But it does have the soul of one,			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really like this game for the most part. However, there are two things that are very frustrating:1. Sometimes enemies can have multiple hits in a row, and other times they take turns with you (like most old-school RPGs).  This is very confusing as an enemy can just annhilate you without you getting a hit in.  2. Often during battle initials pop up and there is no explanation for what they mean or what they do (MDF, etc.).  Some information on the battle system would help.At first I recommended this game, but the more I play, the more I say save your money.  Even at 2 bucks, it's a rip.  The enemies range from being too easy to downright impossible, all within a short distance of each other.  No guidance or instructions... what a mess.  Thumbs down.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even though I am not personally a fan of this genre, it has all the qualities and features of JRPG games, a decent story that brings nothing new but also isn’t disappointing, clean and bearable graphics, etc. Best part of Labyronia RPG game is its gameplay process (need to mention the fact that the progression is non-linear placed in a huge world), which is awesome, very addicting, very entertaining and actually very demanding.

-Quick Review-Labyronia RPG was developed by Labyrinthine and released in 2015. As it's name suggests: Labyronia is an RPG. being an RPG there are many common themes that you experience in this genre of games: Emphasis on story, monster grinding, and gear juggling.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: You play as Arres, a particularly gifted Mage and student of Ibiz, you start your quest in an isolated shanty, and very little explanation on what to do. Like many classic RPG's you don't start out knowing what your goal is, you need to systematically talk to everyone and eventually come across the objective.Sure, the “About this game” text give some incite into what the objective is, but when you actually start playing you need to stumble and explore your way to each area. The only way I figured out where to go next, is if one place 1-shots me, then I guess that's not the next area to go. (rocket science... i know)An update... of sorts...About 10 hours into the game suddenly interesting things started to happen and I started to become invested in the story, consider this an ""updated"" section of the guide; I became quite interested in Arres, and the enemies he encountered. It turns out there is more to the story then I had realized!Gameplay: Labyronia RPG boasts on 6 key features:1) “non-linear progression”Well in a literal sense there is some sense of exploration, but as I said earlier, it was pretty clear to me when I was in the wrong area: I would be defeated in 1 hit.2) “Cue system to encourage exploration”Not really, if you play RPG's you speak to everyone anyway, and anytime you see some strange structure you're going to check it out in case it progresses the story. I would disagree with this point, the Cue system could be replaced with any reward.3) “Strategic Boss battles, and smooth combat system”I would disagree with this feature, while the combat is very minimalist, there are some key points that you need to learn about within the game, specifically: different armor increases different stats, sometimes you need to equip a higher magic defense item, over a better general-defense-item.(Call me an idiot, but in almost every other game ever made, the more green numbers the better the armor is... not the armor that spikes one stat.)4) “Random Battles are only on the world map”Thank god, more RPG's need to do this. The down side is that you need to leave and reenter area's to grind, but I'm not complaining! I'd rather have the chance to sneak by an encounter.5) “Clean, colorful visuals”Well that's a fair description... but I'm not the kind of person who cares about graphics, I could play a game which only has text... if it was well written I could enjoy it too.6) “Experience the emotional storyline and challenge the four elemental gods”Well, I haven't felt emotionally moved by these characters because you don't really learn more about Arres, he's almost a silent protagonist... he does occasionally speak when progressing in the story, but at least half way through the game I don't really have a sentimental connection to this world, or the story.update after 10 hours:It gets better! but you gotta keep going for it to get interesting...Achievements: Labyronia RPG has six achievements, the easiest to earn are the first three. The first achievement (Welcome to the world!) you earn just by starting the game. The second (Unknown Explorer) is earned if you stumble into the forest early... which you probably will, you'll do it sooner or later. The third achievement you'll earn by wandering around and speaking to everyone in the game, you'll eventually come across a random bar and see a poor fellow in the corner by himself. The last three achievements are unlocked much later in the game.Price: Labyronia RPG is priced at $2.99, while I won't say 'this game is the most fun RPG I've ever played', it passes my price-value-system, for every dollar spent I want to spend at least an hour playing the game.Conclusion: To recap: The story was so-so, not very memorable. The gameplay is on par for most RPG's, but not very engaging. The achievements aren't over done, but do require beating the game. The Price is very fair for the game released.I can recommend this game to anyone who wants to play an RPG which is easier on your computer graphic's card and CPU, doesn't mind experience grinding, looking for some challenge and learning new-ish mechanics.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update November 15, 2015:For some strange reason I could post ""test"", but not my whole review, so I just posted test and pasted my review in its place.Edit/Update August 15, 2016:Click here to check out my Labyronia RPG 2 review[/url ",141,13,3,13,8,0,23

												♥♥♥♥♥ water shrineEDIT:  Okay, here is the real review xD.Pros:This game has very simple controls and you don't even need a tutorial to learn how to fight and control your character, it's that simple.Hours of gameplay in store.  I know that I don't have very many hours, but I still tell that there is a lot of game in store for me.Very cheap for what it is worth. This game is masterpiece and I think that the developers should bump up the price.  I got it for around $2 on sale, and it is at least $5 - $10.Cons:Some parts are slow and take a lot of patience.  But really, is everything in a video game going to be action packed all the time?  No.You have to grind a bit.  This isn't a huge problem in the game, but you just need a little patience.♥♥♥♥♥ Water Shrine.  (It really isn't bad or a con, I am just impatient when running through it xD).Overall, this game is very enjoyable to me and I love playing it.  I would definitely recommend this to people who like the Final Fantasy Series 1-6, Chrono Trigger, and any RPGs.			",124,11,0,14,8,0,1

												An hour into the game im giving up; It doesnt have good pacing at all. Walking to the first town you'll (maybe) randomly encounter some mobs that arent that hard to kill but after that i seemly could not defeat anything, so i repeated farming and farming and farming in hopes maybe id get better: nope... once you are effected by a status effect you'll die. I ran into two mobs that had a silly attack pattern First one lowered Att and Def( not that bad ) just made it a long ♥♥♥ fight for nothing bt a normal mob. The second one had sleep and a regain, the regain was way to high (50hp when i was hitting for about 75-100) and the fact that you have a single character the sleep just stops any chance of counter play ( even if i wanted to buy the super overpriced status removing item (500g even i was getting 20-35g per mob). The game was pretty empty from what i saw and that fact you NEED to grind to get anywhere thats kind of a problem. I wont hate on the story as i never got into it but i will say i didn't see it being anything worth grinding more for.			",140,29,2,13,8,3,14

												Labyronia RPG is a cute little RPG, similar to Final Fantasy VI, Dragon Warrior, and other NES-based RPG's. The plot is interesting, Four Elemental GODS, acquire an artifact that enables them to take control over the world, The nations lay down their arms in terror, but the Wizards of Labyronia refuse and fight back. After being all but wiped out, the story begins with Arres, who we know little about at first. Arres is tasked with a mission, through he doesn't know the reason behind it, and he sets out from his remote village and your story begins.I think the game is very well done for a 16bit JRPG, Visually it looks like a typical retro RPG, and the music is very comforting, something you would expect to find in a final fantasy game. I think it is sufficently challenging to be both fun and replayable. For such a low asking price, this is a game worth picking up if you like Retro RPG's with an interesting story and some challenge behind them.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												I have mixed feelings towards this.  The first half of the game is very frustrating, and the second half is much better.In the first half of the game you only have one party member, so getting hit by status effects is very dangerous.  Also it's possible to wander into places that you won't be able to handle.  The second half mitigates this quite a bit, but it's also hard to complete the game without a lot of grinding.

												If you like old school RPGs this is a well-designed one for a RPGMaker game.  The story is reminiscent of when we had to defeat elemental lords of water, fire, earth and air to beat the earlier Final Fantasy games, although it is a bit simpler than any of the classic RPGs.  That's okay, though, if you're just playing this game to kill some time.  It does a good job of that - expect to spend at least 20 hours in finishing this game.Game progression can also be pretty non-linear, meaning I had to figure out how I would like to proceed - and there were enough options to make the game more interesting than most of your cookie-cutter RPGs out there.  It was easy to miss something important and a lot of backtracking might have to be made.  If you're very thorough with exploring, it will pay off, though.  And if you miss something, you might come back much stronger, making backtracking that much easier to do.  I was especially satisfied with how I came back to one particular area - the Deep Grotto - and was able to handily beat a mob that I couldn't the first time I went through it.The story itself is linear, though - your actions won't change how the game ultimately plays out.  The puzzles are somewhat challenging but not overly frustrating if you have a good memory and pay attention to what you're doing.  There are some key items you absolutely need to make any progress at all, however.  The pickaxe is especially important and you will always have occasion to look for a way to use it.  The labyrinths are only frustrating if you keep forgetting the way to go.  The enemies have vulnerabilities you have to learn how to exploit.  You also have to learn new abilities from finding ""cues"" which can be anything from a statue to an animal, as well, so keeping an eye out for anything unusual is important.  Learning what gear can be best for specific battles is also useful in many different situations.Dialogue was pretty well done, although I had to chuckle at some of the text in the books that you read in the game - one called a historical decision ""ret..arded"" for example, not exactly what you'd expect in the lore of a fantasy game.  A blossoming romance in the game also felt unnecessarily forced.  Forming an actual party actually doesn't happen until much later in the game which I felt like was something that could have been done sooner.  That being said, the game is very fun to play for old school RPGers and I recommend it if you like that type of game.			",11,2,0,4,0,0,0

												Amaizing game!I recommend you to play Legend of Mysteria first to follow the story.The gameplay is simple and smooth, The battles are challenging, because you need to know the attacking sequence for each opponent in order to win, especially against bosses. No need to check everything in your environment, you only had to look for cues, and they are pretty visible.I had so much fun playing this gameand beating it was really challenging.

												How anyone can recommend a game that has controls this poor is a mystery to me...Negatives...Out of combat gamepad - pick one analogue or direction keys to moveInside combat - the REVERSE one controls combat... so you can move with the one but then menus and combat is the other... that is just utterly stupidGameplay balanace... outside the very first part of the game, you can encounter an enemy who literally cannot be beaten until you level up...  I often wondered why evil villans didn't have their level 99 monsters guarding near small villages...  Turns out this evil enemy is smart enough to do so.F1 needed to full screen, no real options for the game...Its just NOT good...NOT good I say			",107,22,0,46,4,0,5

												One of the better RPG Maker titles I've played, Labyronia revels in the old school mechanics of the genre without feeling tired.Pros:+Solid writing+Good atmosphere+Music's not shabby+Great gameplay time/price ratio (especially on sale)+Achievements that are possible (I got 100% in about 12 hours)+Sense of progression+Many well designed dungeons+Lots of secrets and lore to find+Has a sense of polish usually only found from larger development studios, would not feel out of place in a SNES cartridgeCons:-Can be very unclear on where to proceed, both in story and actual direction in a few areas (I'm looking at you, desert)-Difficulty curve is wonky-Grindy in parts-Story isn't exactly new-A lot of back tracking to get spells for new party members-Wind Shrine and final boss towerAll in all I had great fun with it and beat it over the course of 2 or 3 evenings. While it heavily leans on old ideas for the storytelling (ice world, fire world, rescue the 4 crystals, get an airship, etc etc) it tries to get it right on the details. It was also one of the few JRPG style games I can recall where you only had 1 party member during the majority of the game so kudos to that.			",204,37,8,29,20,0,26

												Labyronia RPG is a game about a guy named Arres who goes in search of his past. Spoiler:   Later discovered that memory loss is related to the appearance of labyrinths in Labyronia.	The objective of the game, as well as discover the past of Arres, is to save Labyronia of the appearance of mazes that can destroy the whole region and contribute to the appearance of monsters in different places, so it is necessary to collect four elemental crystals scattered around the map.During the journey you will need to unlock your skills, called cues, which are hidden in random objects found, in treasures and/or rewards of any extra mission. It will also unlock two more playable characters, but is virtually at the end of the game  (so no need to worry about unlock them). Pros   Engaging story;  Labyrinths in every corner;  Difficulty above normal;  Easy drop cards. Cons   Fullscreen mode (4 x 3), does not have Widescreen (16 x 9);  Maps without lateral border is annoying especially in Alathar and Desert of Illusions;  Bug in printscreen with F12, it goes back to the home screen without saving any progress.

												Has some problems.  Aside from standard issues I see in a lot of RPG maker games (repeating conversations that are meant to happen once, inability to use WASD for movement, out of place slang, and minor grammatical issues sporadically throughout) this game is very confusing.The opening scene is meant to be dramatic, but I was just left with the feeling that large pieces of the story were missing.  Then there's actually navigating the world.  The entire story is based on Labyrinths, which can lead to some frustration, but my main problem was figuring out where I was supposed to go next.  I finally stopped when I got to a point where everywhere I went was either blocked by rocks, or full of instant death battles.  I got this game in a bundle for what amounts to 18 cents, so I'll keep it and come back eventually to see if I can make it to the end, but I can't recommend it.  There are better RPG maker games available for free.			",71,48,1,17,5,0,3

For those who either don't want check it out or don't have the 30 mins it takes for me to get to the ponit that I kinda liked it however after playing about 5 more hours I definitely don't, I feel the game is lacking in balance, focus, proper path finding and forces you to grind right out of the gate with monsters that can hit twice and cause poison, this causes most players to spend way to much time in the starting area and a bunch of uneeded game overs.It's not just in the starting area either practically every area you go to feels like a game of guess what the dev is thinking from an area of ware-wolf's that you cannot fight until your lvl 10 at lest with the fire ball technique or a snow field thats so big you have to spend 2 hours at lest before you figure out that this game just hates you.What I didn't really get to record is just how bad some of the maps can be for instance: in the aforementioned snow field you have to know in order to continue on you have to get a key from a dragon that you have to fight  dragon, but in order to do that you have to find a key in a field, after that you have to find a diary in a ruined house in order to help a ghost that doesn't tell you any of this, but then and only then can you go to a castle to get an item that you need to cross a desert, AND THAT IS ONLY ONE AREA!Even the story witch is THE most important part in a RPG is completely glossed over and we're give some lines about gods and labyrinths and we need elemental stones.... alright its not that I wasn't paying attention here its that in this RPG the story is taking a back seat and letting to player drive, and while that may work for some games in the genre a game made in RPG maker cannot claim unique that it has revolutionary new game play mechanics.However that being said I did enjoy battle (when I wasn't being put to sleep, blinded, and grounded at the same time) and the world and monster designs were definitely nice, the music in the game is just awesome and I love that this game is made by some one who is inspired by older game like chrono trigger and I can really feel some of the older RPG's influence in many different areas in the game.It would have been really nice to see this game get rebalanced, maybe get another look over and fix some things, or even a easy mode for newer players, but as I'm writing this I can already that they have a squeal so with heavy heart I must give this a final score of 4/10 below average.

												Labyronia is a really good, classic JRPG that should satisfy fans of the genre. The music is really catchy in some areas in the game and makes the experience pleasant throughout. The art direction in the battle scenes is excellent. The dialogue is well thought out and often entertaining - I liked that the world of Labyronia was very consistent and had a history behind it which reflected the locales you explored. There are also lots of things to read which added more context to the world without being superfluous - I just couldn't help myself by reading all of the books in the environment. The battles are strategic and generally quite balanced throughout the game. I really only had to grind at the very start of the game to build up my character, afterwhich the battles scaled very smoothly and were still challenging. The game rewards thorough exploration, most of your magic skills are obtained by exploring areas and finding cues which are contained in distinguished objects and monsters. Much of the puzzles and game progression is driven by your ability to connect various clues in the environments and dialogues - I rarely found myself in a quandary about what to do next.Overall, I would give this game an 8.5/10. Also, I beat Bastion before I started this game, and I would easily choose Labyronia over Bastion anyday. Bastion was good, but not nearly as strategic and open as Labyronia.			",44,19,0,42,1,0,20

												this review has spoilers youve been warnedMy god this game was terrible, i give it credit for actually functioning.graphics are RPGM stock, the story barely exists, half the time you have to wander around explore new places and acedently progress the plot. characters are flat and dialog is bland and lifeless. the romance just plain breaks suspension of disbelief.quiet a few mechanics are bothersome as well. want to learn skills? guess what, you have to find them by enteracting with random objects like a broken green jar, or a golden tinted mug of beer. good luck finding all of your skills. dungeons live up to the games name and are massive mazes with few landmarks and many duplicate layouts to make it even harder to navigate, the also wrap top to bottom and left to right. one dungeon has a perpetual game over timer you refil by using an item and if you forget to use the item, the game wont use it for you, it just game overs. the game only has 3 characters, and you dont get the other 2 until past the halfway mark of the game, and you cant use them in the final battle. speaking of final battle, cliff hanger ending, hope you bought the sequel!all in all i kept pushing through hoping it would improve only to be let down again and againthis game was not worth properly formating this review			",155,61,3,71,15,2,23

												Labryonia was simple but enjoyable enough for a time but is weighed down a glaring flaw: you only have one party member, at least for the few hours I played it. What this means is that when an enemy inevitably hits you with Sleep or Paralysis, it will probably end in a game over. This is one of the few games where those status effects seem to last a decent amount of time, and with no one else around to heal you there is nothing you can do.It was a very cheap game but I certainly do not have the patience to brute force my way through because one area decided to have an enemy who could afflict the aforementioned status effects turn after turn.

												Disclaimer: I was generously given a free copy of Labyronia RPG with the understanding that I was expected to review the title after spending some time with it.       Before I even began playing, I already had a gripe: Labyronia was not built for HD. Yes, I know that the art style mimics that of old SNES RPGs but that is no excuse for looking absolutely janky when in fullscreen. Following up the poor initial presentation was a story that was... cheesy? I find it difficult to accurately describe it. There are Gods who have a super power ancient artifact, non-gods are at war with them, non-gods lose and the world is fractured into X number of factions/regions, etc. It’s not quite “cookie-cutter” but very generic for these types of games.       Speaking of broad stereotyping of RPG maker games, the opening scene-as if following the cliche template bullet for bullet-begins with you waking up in your bedroom. At least others give some quasi-convincing exposition for why you of all the inhabitants of the world are going to begin a journey to defeat the prior specified evil. Labyronia opens with “Time to fight this evil, which I am qualified to do because I have magic and skills. Let me get my sword out of the chest.” I don’t think a game has ever motivated me less.       So what was my gameplay experience like? I wandered around the room and clicked on things (like you do) bringing me to the first straw: the default key binding for interacting with anything is O (B for 360 pads). Yes this is a almost pointless gripe, but I was curled up and comfy in bed with no desire to get up to the keyboard to remap it. I sucked it up and headed out side, using the button ubiquitously responsible for cancel/escape to talk to people. In the process I managed to open my inventory, a critical RPG feature which I have no idea how to access since the only button pressed thus far has been O/B. This led to the acquisition of straw number two. I got out of bed determined to figure out all the buttons once and for all via the F1 menu. This was the most horrendous mapping interface I have ever seen; gamepad buttons were mapped to random letters with no explanation as to what they actually did. I couldn’t be bothered to decrypt this menu so I returned to the game for the final straw. I COULD NOT leave the inventory screen. For those who are thinking “Oh, you just don’t have the button mapped to the controller correctly”, you’re right. Do you know where else it wasn’t mapped? ANYWHERE. I pushed every-and I do mean every- button on the keyboard and mouse and nothing did more than give me a rude buzzer.        RPG Maker shovel-ware is a dime a dozen (often literally) and unless you offer something mindblowing out of the gate, any small flaw or defect can become a dealbreaker. I have a key for Labyronia RPG 2 which is next on my roster; here’s hoping they have polished it up considerably.			",296,131,12,29,48,4,47

												WARNING: IF YOU PLAN TO BUY AND PLAY THE GAME, MAKE A MULTIPLE SAVE WHEN YOU ARE IN THE DESERT AREA. There is a bug which forces you to start over in that area.Now, on to the review.Note that i got this game for free as a bonus from a giveaway.This is a RPG Maker game. I finished the game in around 9 hours with a guide in hand (which means, it can be longer).Pros:- Loads of labyrinth. If you like dungeons and labyrinth, this game is perfect for you.- You don't really have to grind in this game (you will beat the game when you are level 2x+).- You'll have to do some exploring to proceed (which continues to cons #1)- Well thought concept of the world, although some parts seems 'weird' and not explained thoroughly.Cons:- You can get stuck on certain area, mostly because there isn't a clear explanation of what to do next.- Late-coming party members. You get party member when you are about to finish the game, which is uncool.- Some music can be annoying (especially that clock ticking sound)- No clear difference between the equipment status unless you buy them. You can only compare whether your armor has a higher defense compared to the armor you use (who knows if you are looking for magic defense stat for armor?). It doesn't really matter later on though.Is it worthy to buy this game?Depends.Are you the type who likes to spend money for a game? If so, then yes.Are you the type who doesn't like to spend money for a game? If so, then no.You see, the game is very cheap actually, and it got a discount (at this moment).If you enjoy old JRPG games, then just grab it.			",104,49,4,17,11,2,6

												Well... that was certainly an adventure.Labyronia is obviously similar to Finaly Fantasy, Dragon Quest and  Chrono Trigger as it states, though it has taken inspirations from these games, it is its own game entirely and I reccomend playing it.Lets start of with the negatives:-Lack of Story until the end - For the most part you're just gathering these crystals because of a hunch and the story doesn't start unravelling till the end- No Directive - This game doesn't tell you where to go from the start, it just puts you in and if you end up going to Ferdel Forest, like most people do, you'll continuously die no matter what you try and get frustrated, this almost made me quit at the start- All mobs are extremely hard without grinding - If you want to be able to easily get past monsters, grind your heart out because thats the only way you're going to travel through with a breeze. I reccomend fighting random monsters around Jenise until you're level 12 then go to the deep grotto past Ferdel Forest and farm were wolves, when you get the baloon go south of the desert to a dirt island, the monsters there give you 15k exp per kill.-The love story just happens - He meets the girl and is like all of a sudden ""I wanna hold you in my arms, I love you"" with no real conversation besides complimenting each others eyes.Now the Pros-Nostalgic Feel - it has the clasic rpg feel and it brings back memories from the days of playing Final Fantasy-Rewarding for your hard work - The harder you work to complete this game, the more cues, levels and gear you get, the better you feel afterwards when you can kill mobs that you couldn't before with ease.-Good Story - Even though the story takes a long time to develop, it is a good story.-Good Gameplay - Its got the classic rpg gameplay, the gameplay that made RPG games the games they are now.I reccomend this game to any of you RPG enthusiasts or RPGMAKER fans.

												Im enjoying the game so, far. I was worried i was going to dislike this game because many rpg maker games are terrible. This one has to be on my top 5 favorite RPG maker game. Ive enjoyed it so much i have bought part 2. The game is simply amazing! Only downfall i have to say is you literally have to lvl up at some spots just so you wont die over and over again. Once you start lvl till you reach 5 or else your going to die and die and rage, Same goes to the final boss! Just lvl till you are lvl 40 and than fight him!Pros:Good StoryPuzzles.Challenging Detective game.Many things to exploreGood dialogueCue system.Cons:Too much grinding			",889,197,17,58,56,3,87

												For costing just a few bucks, this game was pretty good. An ambitious setting, solid combat, and unique mechanics kept me playing even when the puzzles had me flustered.You can tell the creators spent a lot of time dreaming up the world of Labyronia, with a history of war, magic, gods, and monsters to discover as you play. Some details seem superfluous, while you may want to keep others in mind if you want to progress. Talk to every NPC, read every book, and examine everything that looks even slightly out of place. You'll find that rewards await the diligent investigator in the form of quest items, spells and abilities, and treasure.The combat is simple enough, with most enemies sporting elemental weaknesses that you find by setting them on fire and such. There is a difficulty curve that can be quite steep if you don't take some time to grind a level here and there. The acquisition of the second and third party members is relatively close together fairly late in the game, which trivialized several battles but made up for it near the end of the game, when combining abilities is almost essential to prevail.Cues are in-game locations and objects that serve as skill books, with each cue teaching a spell or ability to a certain party member. Keep each cue you find in mind, as you may not be able to use it the first time you run across it. Some are for abilities you might never use, but others are pretty much required to beat the game. With a wealth of items and several tiers of gear, you'll upgrade at a nice pace. Since the best gear is found in the world and money isn't really ever an issue past the beginning, it's easy enough to dilute the difficulty by buying stacks of health potions and revives and whittling away at stronger enemies while chugging healing drinks.The puzzles ranged in difficulty from ""that was a puzzle?"" to ""there is no way this is a puzzle, the game must be broken,"" and I had to look up the solution once or twice because I'm bad and I should feel bad. But you shouldn't feel bad if you have to. As you may have guessed from the name, there are several labyrinths involved in this game. Another, less obvious theme is that of fractals. These two concepts serve as the foundation for the design and aesthetic of the world, for better or worse. You'll wind your way through a labyrinth, spot that chest sitting just out of reach on another spur of land, and wonder where you had to turn three intersections back to get to it. Likewise, you'll wonder what lay in the center of this strange pattern of terrain and go back and forth to find an entrance and wriggle your way through, usually to a prize.A few of my gripes were that some areas were just too big, with a lot of empty space you have to run through, usually while you're backtracking from a dead end. All of the quest items are only used once to get past a specific obstacle, which was a bummer for me at first. After getting these shoes that let me walk on lily pads, you think I would be able to walk across all the lily pads, and not just the one floating in front of the door of a shrine I need to burglarize. Many puzzles could have easiliy incorporated elements that would put these items to use so that when you find one it doesn't just get used once and lay forgotten in the key items tab of your inventory. Even some of the usable items were literally useless, except to provide flavor. I thought that maybe this drakna cigar or whatever might have a use somewhere down the line, perhaps to trade with an NPC, but apparently it's just for when the hero gets to jonesing for a smoke. Sure, it probably restores some (of what replaces) mana, but I never noticed. It's the same sort of thing with several other items. At the end of the day, all you need are the potions that fullly restore health, the ones for mana, and the revive items once you get party members.Labyronia is a great game, especially considering the price. If you can get it on sale, even better. It's several hours of puzzling, fighting, and storytelling on par with a more expensive game, with just a few drawbacks to test your patience.

You have to grind a lot to be able to beat most bosses. Pros:-Interesting plot -Cues -Feels great when you beat a boss -Pretty big map -Steam trading cards Cons: -Grinding -Story really starts at around 50%  I give Labyronia RPG a 7.5/10  ",230,86,10,29,13,5,30

												Quite possibly the best .49 cents I've ever spent! Yes, it's an RPG Maker game, but it's done very well IMO. If you like Final Fantasy 2 on the SNES( 4 in Japan), but don't mind if the quality is brought down a few notches (you can't expect a small upstart studio to compete with Square Soft...)  I genuinely enjoyed the story and the mazes drove me crazy.... in a good way! Bosses were pretty tough in spots, and it is a little ""grindy"" which I like.Coming from a JRPG fan of over 25+ years (I played FF1 on the NES back in '88-ish along with the original Dragon Warrior) This game is totally worth even the full price of $2 easily! I put approx 20 hours into it to ""90%"" it (didn't find everything... but most stuff) and beat the game. If you like old school FF or Phantasy Star, you will probably like this, that is if you aren't extremely picky.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is surprisingly addictive, offering a good blend of story-driven content, regular fight scenes, hidden loot and the ability to trade in towns. If you are a fan of Ultima and other early fantasy titles, you should enjoy this game. From the start, the encounters with monsters prove quite challenging. If you choose to fight rather than escape, it is worth saving often to avoid death.In my opinion the graphics look best when playing zoomed out in a window, rather than full screen (toggle using F5/F6). The soundtrack keeps things interesting and, at times, the music choices really add to the atmosphere of the scenes. The controls are also very simple to use.The only downside I can foresee is that once the quests are complete, there is limited replay-ability. On the plus-side though, there is Labyronia 2 and Mysteria to follow. At such a low price, Labyronia is really worth exploring.			",36,28,0,2,3,0,17

												Labyronia is a very well done RPG that reminds me of the final fantasy series.The story starts with Labyronia which is controlled by four gods together with the Pendant of Labyronia (the the main quest item that you're after) rule the world.In the past the council of wizards rebelled against the gods although they were defeated.With the whole realm of Labyronia falling due to strange and powerful monsters it's up to you to recover the labyronia pendant and reunite the realm.Overall score:Story: 9/10Graphics: 10/10Gameplay/mechanics: 10/10 (very similar to old school RPGs I've played)Music/sound: 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Labyronia RPG is about a man who seeks himself and his purpose. The plot is very interesting because there are elements, gods, and love kinds of stuffs which I liked about most RPGs.Why you should try it:-As I said, great plot! (There is also a sequel, so it might be that good.)-Unlike the other RPGs on steam, Labyronia RPG will take some of your time. (like about 5-8 hours?)-The maze are somewhat confusing but CHALLENGING!-Unlike others, you need to search for your skills!I recommend it!			",14,2,0,2,0,0,0

												First off let's understand what the name of this game entails.Labyronia... Labrynth.That one key word: Labrynth, already tells you what you're in for.This is a labrynth styled game. If you're not into games where you spent a lot of your time traversing the land and the areas going in circles, then this game is not for you. This game isn't for you either, if you're expecting to be guided. This is a very lightly guided game, you're in charge of where to go for the most part, but you'll find that there are areas for higher levels and areas for lower levels. Otherwise, if you're into that kind of stuff, then this game is for you. I enjoyed the grinding aspect, because I didn't know what level I had to be to really be prepared to kill ♥♥♥♥.. I ended up grinding up to level 15 within the first 4 hours of gameplay. A few of the areas are really frustrating..namely the snow area. Too much white. Outside of that, this wasn't half bad for the purchase. But I'd definitely recommend getting this game when it's on sale. The dialogue in this game is meh, but it's decent enough. Overall for the price of 50 cents for this game and it's sequel.. I'd give it a 7/10.			",37,0,0,5,2,0,3

												Labyronia RPG is a decent game. It's not great. It's not bad. It's just decent.Playing through this game, I noticed a few plot holes here and there. They weren't story-breaking, but they were apparent enough to bring me out of the experience of playing the game.The story is alright, but sometimes it felt like it wasn't explained well enough. Or, at other times, it was explained too much. This left me confused every now and again. I figured I would keep playing and it would make sense later (which most of it did), but it still brought me out of the experience of playing the game.The grammar of this game is a bit rough. I'm no English major (or a hardcore grammar policeman), but I even noticed some issues.I ended up using the walkthrough on the Community Hub to figure out most of this game. I felt like I was stumbling my way through the entire thing.Despite all these issues, I liked the game. The story is fun enough too. If you can get it on sale for 50 cents or so, I would suggest buying it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is a pretty linear game; however, the pace of the game is just right.  There is a section of the game that I found to be tedious (the desert and snow section) as you can easily walk on and on looking for your way to advance the story; however, that is merely a small gripe.The game took me less then twenty (20) hours to complete and I am looking forward to playing Layronia RPG2.

												This right here game is garbage. The only positive thing one could say about it - it's dirt cheap(you could buy a copy by donating hair from your ♥♥♥♥, for example).Game's written in some GUI, so there are flaws right from the start. You can't alt-tab properly. You can't even get to your mixer if you want to dial game's boring repetative music back a bit.  The graphics are as stock as you can imagine, i haven't found one fresh idea all the time i played. The difficulty is ridiculously spastic - you go around killing everything you see, next thing you know you get beaten with no ability to do something. You simply do not want to waste time with this game.My advice would be buying some other, good rpg here on steam, even if it would cost you a few coppers more.			",347,48,4,22,11,0,23

So you can continue to walk in one direction for as long as your heart desires on a map, and you would keep walking.  If you have to find certain check points to have an idea of where you are, and then you can find the items or exits to get out.Good Story, with a Good Ending.  Challenging Combat.  Just a fun, challenging game.Achievement Quest:  So, the achievements are strange as they are not all tied to the story.  Easy to get, but with the game as difficult as it is, might be worth a guide just to get through the game, and if you find one with the achievements along the way, all the better.

												Story: 2/10Gameplay: 3/10Environments: 3/10Despite my negative review, I did have a pretty fun time playing this game. I actually recommend it if it is on sale and if you are willing to put some time into it. There are far, far better RPGs out there, though.StoryAfter the brief intro scene fades out, the main character awakens and for some reason decides that it is time to finally do his part in trying to save Labyronia. That's all the game really gives you to begin the game with, and it makes a bit of a habit out of leaving the player in the dark about what exactly you are supposed to be doing. For the majority of the game the only real information you learn about the world and plot comes from books and notes that you can read and are almost entirely optional. The story only really begins once you have obtained the fire crystal, the third out of four, which is perhaps more than four hours into the game depending on how lost you get in each area. Up to that point you are mostly going around looking for a way to obtain the crystalss and trying to see what areas you can access without dying to enemies. Once the story starts, though, it proves to be both basic and pretty lackluster, especially the sudden romance that occurs between the main character and an eventual party member. There is nothing especially memorable about any of the dialogue in this game; despite playing it to it's completion just the other day I don't even remember if it was really poorly written or not, which may or may not be a plus. It was nice to learn about the characters and the world, but there really isn't much to it all.GameplayGeneral:Regarding the shops in this game, they all seemed to contain pretty balanced items for the area, though I found it strange that so much armor was available for party members you wouldn't even have for a number of hours yet. Sometimes newer shops would even have better alternatives, so there would be no point to going back for the older variants when you could make use of them.As far as consumables go, you can access the Witch's shop very early on in the game, perhaps even before the first boss if you are careful, and it sells full HP potions and full AP potions that are considerably cheaper than a lot of healing items that are not as effective. What's more is that in the area around the Witch's shop are enemies that drop an absolute fortune compared to other monsters and they are only ever fought one at a time. Of course, you can't even dream of fighting them early on in the game, but I found myself heading back to the Witch whenever I needed to stockpile potions.Exploring:Wandering around the overworld was very tedious for the vast majority of the game. In towns and dungeons and such you can move quite a bit faster, but the overworld does not have an equivalent to the ""Dash"" option. I think it wouldn't have been so bad if there had been no chance to encounter enemies in the overworld, especially since the majority of encounters in the game already do not occur in the overworld. Nearer to the end of the game, travel becomes incredibly simple and actually pretty fun, but you have to put up with a lot of trudging around back and forth the world map a couple times to get that far.One of my least favorite aspects of this game is exploring wide open areas. The labyrinths honestly aren't so bad on their own, but the worst part is that there is no map system (save for a place where it was still very possible to get lost even when you know where you are wanting to go). If there were a map that the main character filled out as you explored allowing for easy back-tracking, the labyrinths would have been a lot less of a pain to navigate, but the real pain comes from exploring areas that wrap around (once you go all the way right you end up on the very left, etc) with items in specific places that are required to progress in the game. I recall at least two areas like that in the game, and they both took me a absolutely boring amount of time to completely traverse.One thing I actually really liked about this game was the Cue system. Scattered around the map are interactable objects that your characters can learn new skills from, provided they are in your party. This reminded me a lot of the way you obtained new Effects in Yume Nikki, and it was actually pretty fun to see what skill each Cue was going to give the characters. Unfortunately, a number of these skills are pretty boring or useless and you have to backtrack quite a lot for them once you finally have your other party members. Most of the back-tracking for Cues isn't so bad, but, once again, the wide open areas are a nightmare for finding specific things.Battles:The combat system is very basic in this game which I find to be more of a positive than a negative in this case. However, I was many hours into the game before I accidentally stumbled accross the option to flee battles as there is no indication that you can do so whatsoever. The balancing could have used a lot of work, too; sometimes you can be strolling along defeating enemies with ease and then you can run into an enemy that has the ability to Confuse or Ground you repeatedly, both of which have a chance to render you unable to fight until you die. This is perhaps most apparent in the boss fight for the earth crystal, because if you don't have resistance to Grounding, this is exactly what will kill you over and over again. That's not even what makes this fight so memorable; you'll have to backtrack all the way across the map to purchase an item that gives you that resistance before heading all the way back for the crystal. However, this very same tactic can be used against enemies once you obtain abilities that have a chance to stun, though the game unfortunately does not tell you when an enemy is immune to certain status effects.For the most part, it isn't too difficult to tell when you are powerful enough to be in a new area and as you progress you should find that the majority of enemies (including bosses!) are forgettable and pretty easy to beat. This becomes far more obvious when you finally gain party members, which makes all the battles in the game tremendously simple, especially when you discover a certain skill for the archer; out of all the skills I collected, the second best for the archer attacked three times and had a chance to hit each enemy in the battle, whereas the best skill attacked every single enemy you were fighting six times each.The final point I would like to make regarding the battle system is that the ""twist"" for the final boss irritated me more than anything. It's pretty hard to mention without spoiling what happens, but it basically forces you, without warning, to change your play style right as you face the most difficult battle of the game. In any case, once you've figured out the patterns and how much better flat out resistance is over defense points it becomes pretty simple as well.EnvironmentsI had no issues with most of the art, but apparently a lot of the assets in this game are just RPG Maker assets, and a lot of the monsters looked odd or almost out of place because of this. I had no issues with the music or sound effects. The music was actually pretty nice, but, again, it wasn't particularly memorable. Very few of the characters in this game felt like more than a standard npc, and some of the character portraits looked a bit strange.As far as level design goes, a lot of the game was pretty okay without being terribly original, but there was one labyrinth at the least that I specifically recall disliking, and it was the one where you get the air crystal. Even now I'm not entirely sure how it works, but I assume that it was teleporting me around at random. After clearing it, I just kept walking up to teleporters until I found my way to the end, which left a bad taste in my mouth.			",150,42,3,22,7,0,9

												After I bought ""Legend of Mysteria RPG"" which is developed by the same guy(s) I knew that this game and the sequel are going to be epic. So I waited for a sale and bought them both. These are the best 24 cents I've ever spent for a game (48 for the 2 of them). I got ""Legend of Mysteria RPG"" in a bundle for maybe 10-15 cents. Now, just because they are cheap doesn't mean they are bad. Personally I had a great time playing them. I will focus on reviewing my experience in ""Labyronia RPG"".It's an RPG game (obviously) so that's a plus (for me at least). You fight monsters and bosses, get gold, eat food to regenerate hp or use spells to do that, gain xp, buy a lot of things, explore the map, collect key items, level up, collect cues to learn new spells. I love all of that!I've followed two guides to complete the game. Yes, I died a lot of times and spent time wandering but my point is that it's not a short game.The music is good (not irritating). At different areas it changes. I enjoyed one particular track and the rest were ok.There are many characters, few of which are the main ones. Most of the game you will fight monsters with a single character. At about mid game one more character joins you and then another. The more, the merrier, right? It turns out that ""Legend of Mysteria RPG"" is connected to ""Labyronia RPG"". I mean, in the latter I've been to a place that I'd already visited in the former. However there were still a lot of new areas to explore and that's always been fun. Speaking of which, the map is huge. There are a lot of places to visit and it takes time to do so (I am not complaining). When you are at end game it's a lot easier to travel.The only drawback is that the game crashed twice. But I played it for 15 and a half hours so I can't complain. You have 16 save slots so save often.There are achievements, all of which can be unlocked (I did that) and there are also trading cards (I don't care about them).So for this price it's a must-buy. It's ridiculously cheap if you ask me. I've played tons of games which were more expensive and I didn't enjoy some of them as much as I enjoyed ""Labyronia RPG"". Can't wait to play the sequel. Great game for a great price. The ""Add to Cart"" button is waiting for you to click it. Don't hesitate and do that.			",651,285,14,45,69,10,88

												I really haven't played this long enough to give it a fair review, but so far, for it's dirt cheap price, it seems pretty cool.The game is very similar to Final Fantasy VI with regards to combat and controls. The character models are nice, the art is pretty. So far, after the 20 minutes I've played it, the only downside is it plays like an old 8-bit GBA emulator game, which is fine becuase that seems to be what it was designed to be, and I love those old titles so I don't have an issue with it, but it may be a turn-off for those gamers who are only in it for violence and sexy graphics.OVERAL IMPRESSION: Seems cool and it's dirt cheap so buy it and try it out!

												Labyronia is a maze like RPG where you're free to explore and grind to your heart's content. Without spoiling too much ; You play as Arres who seems to suffer from amnesia, and your goal is to find and explore labyrinths to collect 4 elemental crystals. ( sound familiar ? :P ) It has a slow and grindy start, but it tends to pick up near the middle of the game -- especially when you finally get party members.Summary+ Interesting story+ Fun and strategic combat. Almost every enemy has a weakness, find and exploit it !+ Plenty of collectible spells and secrets to find spread out across the world.-/+ Extremely easy to get lost, but if you like mazes you'll love this. Try to pay attention to landmarks, or marks on the ground like the green (moss?) in the earth labyrinth. You'll be surprised by the subtle hints that you can miss. ALSO read the books and talk to NPCs, they give hints and reveal secrets !- Has a slow and grindy start- Grammar and wording can be a bit off at timesIf you're looking for an RPG that's like some of the classics, like Final Fantasy, then you might enjoy this. It's definitely one of the better RPG Makers I've played. I look forward to playing the second game !			",101,26,2,13,7,1,9

												Mediocre at best. The music is alright, the story was interesting at first but ruined over time (the ending in particular), and it has the basic combat and loot system. The twist with Labyronia though is that it throws you into the game without ANY idea of where to go unless you pay close attention to the dialogue, and even then it still is difficult to know where to go (especially in the desert). That's what makes it unique (I at least haven't seen anything similar), and made me keep going.(there's also the statues you have to find to get more abilities which are nigh NECESSARY and definitely worth using a guide to find.)

												Don't know what I was expecting after reading the title, the game was surprisingly challenging. The gameplay is prettymuch like any other turn-based RPG. Just grind until your over level then wipethe floor with bosses then rinse and repeat. However the main challenging aspect of the game is them maps... 90% of the game are very confusing mazes which loop.Guess thats where the bread and butter of this game lies. Many hours of just walking in circles in  the desert.Overall a really challenging puzzle game more than anything else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok so I really tried to like this game but with that said I can not reccomend this game. First story seems like its going to be decent so their no problems there so lets start with the cons since I didn't get any where the 10 times I tried it. The enemies are WAY to difficult, feels like some random stats pulled up on RPG Maker with no thought put in to which current level you are or what gear you could possibly have. Like after you start you walk down the road a ways to find a town, this town has your normal stores with only a few items, weapons and armors. Ok not a problem but the price was (I'll get to that later). Now I set up with a +2 from the standard sword you start with for a crappy axe for 35G but better then sword. I then sold sword for 50G, sweet more stuff I can buy. I proceed to the Armory, find they have a buckler for 40G to go with my armors and weapon! I then head to the general store to maybe get some thing else but decide to save since everything was $$$. After that I leave town, find a campsite and some upgraded armor to replace the worn tunic I had, awesome and unexpected. So I proceed north explore a little get in fight its a Ogre! Wow ok I knew of the ogres but one attack from this guy was a 3 hit combo killing me!!!! So I started my save from town did all over changed to better axe this time. Fought 2 elven archers trying to get out of FIRST maze at level 2, did 400+ damage to one enemy and he did not die and they killed me. Well luckly I saved at the begining of the maze as it gives you that option. So start up again go a different way in maze and BAM some rock throwing creature kills me in 2 hits!! F#^%^&# And this whole time I had tried different weapons, armors, combos, found some ""RARE"" tobbaco leaves which cost more then I could sell for. I don't know maybe I did something wrong or whatever but I have RPG Maker VX Ace and MV so I feel personally the scale is way off balance and for that I can't reccomend. ",59,7,1,2,7,0,0

												Poor difficulty balance makes it borring overall. It seems like it would be a fun game, but its maybe 1% playing and 99% grinding for levels from the very beginning to be able to not die instantly in the level 1 forest area... and again for the level 2 forest area after that, but its even more boring because the battles are not random in the second area so it takes more time to go to each spawn location then leave and reenter the area to grind for the third area... I've done this a few dozen times and still die instantly in the third area while using the fire magic that the forest enemies are weak against, I just have to do it another 100 times, spending hours and hours on this boring ♥♥♥♥ to be powerful enough like I did in the first area so I could survive the level 1 forest area. Its not even worth continuing to play it, theres just too many better games in my queue some of which were also <$1. Not to mention free downloads of emulated old Gameboy games are about the same graphics and layout quality with the same style of gameplay but far better difficulty balance so its not so boring to play. Like with Pokemon RGB/Yellow you could actually beat the game with just your starter by defeating every enemy that you bump into naturaly and every trainer/gym leader with him and not do any training, or even do some training with multiple pokemon to work out strategies and its not as boring because you have mini goals (new moves, evolutions) where as in this game you get nothing from leveling except automatic health and power increase, doesn't even have the most basic of rpg strategy elements: stat/skill points to apply. Instead you gain skills by clicking on stuff in nature... In say LoZ OoA/OoS for Gameboy you don't even have to deal with this stupid grinding ♥♥♥♥ because it doesn't have player levels its just based on your own skill as a player, but this game is like the opposite of that they have only very rudimentary strategy like use fire spell to damage willowosips or do more damage to elves, wind spell to do more damage to mosquitos in the first area. But by the time you are able to tolerate the level 1 forest area you have all of the best equip from the first town (except the lucky charm, which I have now and it does nothing) and can kill those mosqitos with one physical attack anyway. This game is maybe a 2/5, because the grinding is ridiculously long and boring.I was informed in the comments that despite the fact that I was prevented from entering the area to the north of the first area which is what forced me to enter the forest area second, the game is designed to allow the player to go to that area. The developer claims that doing so will make it not require grinding before you can tolerate the level 1 forest area but by his own admission this does not effect the difficulty jump to the level 2 forest area. I have not felt like starting a new game to test the validity of his claim that it eliminates grinding required for a beginning player if you (assuming you can) go to the area north of the first area (across the bridge) before attempting to enter the forest. However even if it eliminated the grind requirement to enter level 1 forest; which I highly doubt, reduce yes but eliminate that much time of grinding just by traveling to one other town and back I find hard to believe even with more powerful items; my issue with grinding would not change as the second area still jumps in power. Which as I mentioned is a part of his difficulty design, you need to be lucky enough to not be attacked by the werewolves (expect to die a lot, I did) before you (I assume) find a new spell that makes them beatable (I never found it, and decided grinding would be faster, but got tired of the grinding lameness) just like with Fire in the first forest level. All of the other reasons I have specified for not recommending this game are still valid, and if you also find these reasons to be a good reason to not play the game then you shouldn't buy it but if you don't mind them then you should give it a try because you will probably like it if you're not as intolerant as I am of the issues I've mentioned.

												After deciding to play based on positive reviews, I really wish I hadn't. In a rather irritating way, it has become one of my mini-addictions.Adventure type Labyrinth, slaying monsters, getting terribly lost, saving the kingdom and the like.- The fact that there are no health bars on the monsters in this game is incredibly annoying. Even more so, that it feels impossible to break away from playing, because you may be close to killing something.Anticipation is, with no measure of how fast at all, killing me.(And if there are health bars and I just haven't seen them, die by my sword, ♥♥♥♥♥.) - Lore texts could be written a lot better (and spell checked.) The ideas are there, but it feels very flat and with little depth. - The music however, is wonderful. Seriously, that water labyrinth track? Soundtrack DLs please.- I understand from other reviews that it was made with RPG maker. Perhaps I am a little picky, but once again nothing really stands out among other games of the same genre.In the end, don't hate the game because you died and didn't save. You know just as well as anyone else Mr, that you walked right back to the save point a hundred times without meaning to. Take the hint.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												4 Hours in, don't want to play anymore. I should expect as much from a virtually free game, but my time is worth money to me, and honestly, I feel like I should be paid to play something like this...Problems?, lack of characters, 4 hours in, only one character who doesn't develop on even the bystandards he encounters.Location layout, horrible, mixing vast unending areas with looping terrain and no direction is a sin, especially at the beginning of the game, I'd expect some sort of landscape wasteland somewhere in a good game, after your well involved in the game, but nothings really impressed me yet.Combat is boring, mostly because there are few characters.I don't even want to think about any more things wrong with this game.For a game that Imitates ChronoTrigger, Final Fantasy, and Dragon Quest (and I don't even think Dragon Quest is good), it fails to compare with any of them. They must have been thinking the first Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, but they are not even that good, and it's nothing like ChronoTrigger.Hopefully my curiosity never leads me back to this game, Get Last Dream, or replay a classic RPG, this is not worth the time.

												This is a bad game.  The ideas were there, but it's almost as if it wasn't playtested.  There are tons of gramical errors, which cause you to lose immersion.   You play with ONE character through at least 6 hours of the game.  You have random battles with multiple enemies casting the same spell of confusion, which causes your character to attack any random enemy or himself, no way to remove this effect since you only have the ONE character, no way (That I found before encountering this random battle) to prevent this status effect, the enemies can do this as many times as they want.  So, what you have happen is, you get your airship, land on a random island, walk around for a little to scope it out, get into this fight, lose.  Okay, this is not for me, since I only have one character, let me walk back to the airship.  ONLY YOU CANT GET BACK TO YOUR AIRSHIP WITHOUT WINNING ONE RANDOM BATTLE OF THIS BATTLE WHERE THEY CONFUSE YOU UNTIL YOU DIE.  GOOD THING YOU SAVED ON THE ISLAND AND CAN'T GET BACK TO THE AIRSHIP.

												Definetly a warm reception here.Ok,first offf,RPG maker or not,this a great game.Soundtrack is on target,graphics are good but bland like old school super nintendo and for me this is a good thing.I love the retro look.Battle system is to the point and not overkill so u have plenty of time to explore instead of being sacked every corner you take.The special price for this release is awesome but I would have  easily payed the full for this rpg simply because I can tell there was an honest effort to make this game good and not some devs just trying to cash in on retro game lovers,so that said,thank you for a game well done devs and hope to see more as word has it you are already may have sequels done or in the works and I hope they make it to steam as well.......Oh and folks keep in mind the main character is cleptomaniac,in the short time I have played i have took several peoples gold,snatched a wool robe from someones tent,snagged a fish from a wayfarer on the coast,stole a sausage from a family at dinner time,and the list goes on.This game is definetly on par with Thief Deadly Shadow's.Also this game is better if you toggle the characters speed off,no sense running around like you are on meth for the whole adventure.Nice job,worth my money.Hope my review helps others decide on a purchase and now I must go back and save the world and steal some more stuff.

												I  have played the game a lot more since the past review, and I gotta say, I have had even more of my mind blown. Here is what you can expect from Labyronia RPG: Adrenaline inducing fightsA heist mystery that despite being a Big Lipped Alligator Moment, is entertainingAn engaging story (once you get around 2 it)Fun Party Members with their own pros and cons (Once you get around 2 them)The incredible usage of the cue system, which the game states you don't need but you will spend hours looking for.And freaking huge maps. Really. You will not believe how huge these are. The game is kind of RPG Maker Skyrim.The devs have done way too much, but in a good way. At one point you are in a gigantic desert, and there are not only various NPCs, each coping with heat induced insanity in seperate ways, but there is enough fun little weirdness going on. A living miniature boat takes you to a cryptic creepy clown, there is a Paper Mario type quiz, and a fun little puzzle. The devs have also put together one of the most complete and interesting worlds in an RPG Maker game, and not just map wise. There is an abundance of books that can tell you details about the world and the lore, ranging from personal notes to histories. I can truly say this game, which uses generic rpg maker random encounter enemies, is a rpg maker Final Fantasy game. 9/10.			",40,27,0,16,2,0,1

												The story and setting are uninspired and underdeveloped. You are given a task and that's what you get. You can find some lore books to read that attempt to flesh out the world like what has been seen in the Elder Scrolls series, but there is nothing within the game to connect that lore, so it doesn't even matter and isn't worth the time. Characters don't develop, plot doesn't develop it just advances on its own as you go forth, and the dialog is stale.In terms of gameplay, it is the barebone standard of turn-based RPGs.  Having one character for more than half the game makes some status effects game ending cheap shots. Instead of having magic be a level-based unlock, there is a gimmicky cue system where you must find strange things in your environment to interact with to learn new spells. It is very unnecessary and a pain when new party members finally join for you will be off backtracking to all the areas you visited that had cues you couldn't use. Considering each area is rather small and cues being blatantly obvious, what little exploration is there is forced and uninteresting. The graphics and sound are fine for what they are and I love pixel art, especially where RPGs are concerned. I don't personally care about stock assets considering the price of the game is so low; I understand not everyone is a born Edward Hopper. I'm more interested in plot and setting in these regards and that is where the game ultimately failed for me.Labyronia doesn't feel like a polished game. It seems like a good start to a campaign, despite the formulaic premise, but lacks any real meat to make you care about anything to keep pressing on, despite the short game length. It's too bare-boned and lifeless as a whole for me to regard it in a positive light.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm a person that loves RPG Maker games; my avatar's the Batter from OFF, for crying out loud. I enjoy going on rpgmaker.net and seeing the things that some people can make. A lot of people stereotype RPG Maker games to be low effort when there's just as many games that have care put into them, with original graphics and everything.But this game - and all other games by the creator - symbolizes that stereotype.Labryonia just seems to use the default assets provided by the RPG Maker VX Ace engine along with some resources that seem to be pulled from resource packs. The only original things seem to be those book pages you find lying around every now and then, but even then they all just seem like text pasted onto a page template. As for the story, it's pretty much humdrum elemental stuff. If you're in for an incredibly basic JRPG experience, sure, it's fine, but as some games like To the Moon demonstrates, RPG Maker could be used to tell incredible stories, and sadly Labryonia is as bland as it is uninspired.My play time looks short, yes, but the beginning parts of the game looks like an omen of mediocrity to come. Allow me to rant. The first, real dungeon of the game is the Water Labyrinth. The first dungeon of a game should be easy and interesting (though not overly interesting - the real fascinating stuff should be saved for toward the end), but this dungeon is neither. It's like the Hell Maze from Yume Nikki except somehow worse, and it's real easy to get lost an/or hit dead-ends. The whole dungeon is blue. It's an eyesore. There is little varience in dungeon design as well, save for the occasional red crystal. See, you're supposed to find all these red crystals to open the door to the boss... but of course these crystals are hidden all throughout the dungeon so you'll be stuck with the tedious and eye-killing task of walking around the badly designed dungeon. There are two reprieves though, I'll have to admit. Thankfully encounters in dungeons are on-screen and not random encounters; if they were, I would have dropped the game right then and there. Secondly, there is an item that gives you regenerating AP (the game's version of MP), so you'll be able to heal off any damage you take. If you're sincerely playing this game, I recommend picking this up. Meanwhile, the actual boss fight is manageable - if extremely tedious like everything else.Now that is not a good way to start a game off. Games should ease you into the experience, not bore or frustrate you into senselessness, but Labryonia did just that. I'm honestly shocked that this game has such a good rating on Steam. If rpgmaker.net had more users and momentum, I'm sure that the game would have gotten completely savaged like most other low-effort works. In all honesty, the only reason why I picked this and the second game up is because it was dirt cheap and I'm a sucker for easy Steam cards.Do you want a good RPG Maker game? This is not one. I recommend going on RPG Maker sites and poking around for anything good. I personally recommend Grist of Flies and HOME if you're looking for anything recent-ish. Want to throw your money at an RPG Maker game? Why not give Lisa: The Painful RPG and To the Moon a go instead of this?But then again, this game is dirt cheap, so why not?(If there is one thing to praise about this game though, I like the idea of gaining skills from certain sources. If this was a good game this would push the player to explore, providing incentive beyond a chest full of gold or items. Too bad this isn't a good game.)			",102,41,0,23,9,2,23

												Bought it on sale because it's cheap, and i like RPG and RPGMaker stuff.No complain about the graphics, sounds, or the crazily difficult enemies.The plot is almost nowhere to be found. I found myself staring at the screen for a bit after the 'intro' is done. Who the hell am i playing as? Who the hell is his mentor? Why the hell is he writing a diary at that age? Why is he our chosen hero? The first town i got to also doesn't explains anything. The town is literally just there to be 'your first town you visited after you left your home'.And the biggest downer, the most sinful of all, is the characters. I mean i don't mind playing as an old guy, but do you seriously have to put a guy in a promotional images, and NOT having him in the game? Like, at all?I was seriously hoping that the main character would be the guy from the promotional image, and instead, i got an old man that looks NOTHING like the guy in the picture. I was actually thinking that the old man is sort of like the 'prologue' character, which provides backstory, which then later gets replaced by the other guy.Yeah, i'm only 10 minutes in, and i'm biased towards the things other people said about the characters, but really though? RPG's main selling point is the diversity of the characters, and there's like, 8 hours until my first party member? Yeah no.In short, don't buy this game if you're in for the characters and character development			",132,32,0,31,17,1,8

												I'm a fan of RPG and the description of this game said it was heavily inspired by 3 similarly amazing games. So, decided to try this and yes, I've had moments where I enjoyed it (story mostly) and moments where I hated it (ugh).To begin, the story starts off very mysteriously and nearing the very end, you find out what goes on. It does have a story, but it is not as story rich as one hoped. In fact, not much of a story going on until you encounter the new party members, whom joins you near the end of the game.  Yes, I don't understand why the game was developed in this manner, but oh well. The game mechanics are pretty much turn and agility based. Characters take turns to perform an action and whomever has the higher agility goes first. Soundtrack is nice and kept me entertained during gameplay (all ~10 hrs of it). Not a bad soundtrack overall. Graphics are as mostly decent for an RPG 2D game. Some monsters did appear very pixelated, which I'm not sure if that was intended or not. One big concept with graphics is that most cue items are differently designed to have their graphics be different than a 'normal' object. This and the golden circles for important info in the game are highlighted and should be commended. Otherwise, you will be stuck clicking on many items throughout the game (or just miss it all haha).Past all that comes the downside of this game. When you begin the game, there is absolutely no sense of direction of where to go. No 'navigation' and you can honestly wander off to do something completely out of order. While what you can or cannot do is limited, you can easily frustrate yourself by doing something out of order and have to backtrack. I got lucky and I believe I went in a pretty much correct order, but I can see someone else playing and screwing up at the beginning, because they chose differently. Next, the concept of a looping map is very cool, but not enjoyable. In Alathar and the Desert of Illusions, the maps are gigantic and much larger than I honestly think they should be. You can easily wander the map for an hour or two and just starting to understand where anything is at before you can progress to the next part in the game. It was at this point I had to refer to a guide to even progress, because I spent quite awhile trying to locate what I needed to get to progress in the game. Again, lack of direction/navigation from the game. This is especially true if you stop playing the game and come back to it, you probably won't recall where you left off or what to do next. Another mechanic of the game where I think needs improvement, is that once you have access to Artemis and you have free reign of the world, you really need to keep the airship closeby and remember to go back to it. IE: I went to the desert and went through it all to the other side. Learned the hard way that Artemis remains where you left it (facepalm). Lastly, the concept of money and items throughout the game. At the beginning of the game, I tried to pinch every piece of gold and didn't purchase the most 'powerful' items at the time. If you have played other RPGs, you may have developed a habit hoarding and pinching your resources habit. In this game, not so much of an issue. If you do run out of gold, go fight a few monsters and you will earn it back easily. If you aren't strong enough, wait a little bit and explore the section of where you are and look for the chests. They will most likely yield items for you to be stronger/strong enough to pass through this section and a little bit in the next. So most items aren't necessary until the final section of the game. However, at that point, money is everywhere and you can easily amass it via grinding on some monsters (werewolves are nice, but there are those carnivorous trolls, which are definitely the best!). Some items just come too late in the game too. IE: Crown of Ely, flower that revives you with 50% HP, rings that boost elemental defense. If they came up earlier in the game, it would've been more enjoyable and it could've been a reason to make certain enemies stronger.  Overall, still a fun RPG game to play. I can see someone rushing past the whole game in about half the time I played. I took my time and tried to not refer to the guide as much as possible for about the first half of the game. If you don't have a guide, I think you are looking at 15+ hours of trying to figure everything out. With the guide, straight to finish, probably 5-6hrs. Definitely some issues/flaws in this game, but still enjoyable to play. 7.5/10.			",52,13,0,4,0,0,1

												This game is... mixed.The beginning. The beginning is the worst part and has the slowest crawl. There are secrets everywhere and some are required to find to have a chance or progress. This is one of those games that drops you in the middle of nowhere (Sometimes literally) And gives you no clues or hints on where you need to go next.THOUGH there are times that they do provide hints. Markings in a labryinth or landmarks in a large vast area. And once you get partners the game REALLY starts to pick up. The music is pretty nice actually, especially the boss battles with the choir thing going on and for some reason a late game ice town has a pretty cool techno track. The issue is about eighty percent of the game is you being solo. And you're going to die. A lot. There is once section in the game where you have to run from werewolves because they can stun you and essentially hit you multiple times with a high crit rate. This was the hardest part for me and almost made me quit.The battles have TONS of strategy and even some minor appearances require a bit of though. Unless you're overleveled spamming the basic attack is going to get you killed. And late game there is a bit of backtracking and secret exploration, that's always neat. So I... have to recommend this game if you actually wanna play a retro difficult RPG. Some of the difficulty is forced and will test your patience, keep that in mind. I have to say the plot is eye rolling in the beginning but does pick up near the end with a nice little twist. Not much character development though.  ",95,18,1,15,3,0,3

												So like others before have stated, I wanted to like this game. I really did, but there were far too many cons in just over an hour of playtime that gradually depleted that hope until all I was left with was a game over screen screen prompting me to return to the source and try my luck again, which unfortunately, you will be needing a lot of if you attempt to play this game. First I will start with the pros that I found.+ The sounds and music are very well done, and are reminiscent to Secret of Mana in regards to music quality and Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest in regards to the sound effects, especially your sword attack.+ When you talk to some NPCs they show a small character profile of them which is very well drawn.+ The first and only village I visited, which while small, was well drawn out and I liked seeing some of the animations, including the flowers blowing in the wind, and the birds and butterflies moving around. It definitely added a bit of charm to the otherwise static world.Now I have to move on to the cons and before anybody chooses to downvote my review, please take into account that this is my opinion.- When I booted up the game it started off in a small (Minesweeper) size window that was hard to see, so I found the option to move it into fullscreen which upgraded the screen size about 1/3 more which wasn't much better but it at least made it viewable. Unfortunately, while playing, the screen constantly flickered and glitched while I moved slowly, I might add around the overworld, which after a few minutes began to hurt my eyes. There is an option in the settings where you can decrease the flickering, but after clicking it, it didn't do much to help.- My character moves as slow as a snail in the overworld map to the point where I would pray that I wouldn't encounter an enemy while I could see the lone village at the edge of my screen. Although, his pace quickly changes in specific area screens with the click of the Shift button making it more bearable, but still making me dread trudging once again around the overworld.- The first battle I had after leaving my house was with a Python enemy, and so I thought I got this, but was sorely mistaken after getting knocked out from three hits without even the knowledge of knowing how much damage I inflicted on it. No enemy health bars makes the battles annoying to the point where I had to keep track of how much health each of the six enemy types I encountered had in my head and relied once again on luck to strike back with the correct amount of damage in the fewest amount of turns.- No item drops, only gold which becomes pointless after a short while due to no variance in weapons, armor or items available in the first town. How can the Wool Robe be worth more MDG (Whatever that is) that the Leather Tunic and the tunic only increases your defense by 2 points? Really? How does that make sense?- I must have crossed the first bridge at least thirty times farming for experience, which you will need to do right off the bat, trust me, and no matter how fast I was, or well versed with my timing, could not sneak up on the lone enemy! Almost every RPG, especially 90's era RPGs have allowed the character/ player to sneak up and get a surprise attack, why is that not an option now?- Some of the design choices that were made baffle me, like for instance, on the first bridge, there are holes in it which reveal water beneath that is a solid blue color, like something straight out of MS Paint, but the wood paneling of the bridge is very well textured and designed. That is odd but whatever, eventually get to the Northern Bridge seperating you from the Ice World and the water surrounding the bridge is textured and even animated. Why the difference? It doesn't make any bit of sense.- What you need to be doing and where you need to go are muddled and ultimately left out for you to figure out on your own. Tried heading into the Elven forest but got sniped by the first enemy I encountered, which was an Elven Archer. Okay, let's try the Ice World, but alas, can't break rocks yet and got attacked by a gang of six ice bats all doing 30+ damage each turn which will dwindle your health pretty quickly even after reaching level 5, so I had to flee. Let's try going left towards Jenise which I figured out was the name of a city and not a woman after talking to a bald NPC in the ""Cold Shoulder"" Pub. Good luck trying to make it to the cave that you are supposed to travel through to the city before an Orc destroys you with their critical hits that come into play 1/2 the time. This leads me to believe that I better start grinding away or dash my chances of progressing in the game, which annoyed me further. I understand the need to grind in an RPG but make it not only fun but rewarding for the player. Take Earthbound for instance, you can beat the game at the minimum level of 40 which is nice while I could barely take down the first few enemies in this game at level 5.- The battles are completely based on luck and the games mercy at giving you a good roll of the die. This is the same for a plethora of RPGs but in this game, you merely have to spam the z button and pray that you survive, whereas in other games you can have a bit of strategy.I can go on and on and really nitpick the crap out of this but alas, I choose to forego returning to the source and ending my experience with a few closing comments.I read a review that stated this game felt like it was made in RPG Maker and I can agree wholeheartedly with that statement. Nothing felt finished, and the things that worked were overshadowed completely by the list of things that didn't. This game, is to be put bluntly, lazy and nothing more than a ploy at getting a few dollars here and there from people before getting dismissed to the bowels of Steams library. No wonder the developer is offering $300 to the first person to finish the game and send them a screenshot. It is mindnumbingly tedious and quite an endeavor to brave the rest of the game for a few hundred dollars. So in conclusion, I would not recommend this game for anyone looking to have a good time. Avoid this and go play a better game like Chrono Trigger, Earthbound, Secret of Mana, etc.2/10			",57,11,0,9,1,1,2

												I love good 2 D RPG games. The most has a great charme, this one too. Sure its not uniqe, epic or something but it feels a bit like Zelda Majoras Mask in 2 D get 4 Crystals to find the truth. It has many items and skills to find and they are well hidden and make fun to find every puzzle/ piece. The story is fine mysterious, the fights are tough, sometimes to tough and you get frustated to get back again the whole way without saving and most time you feel lost, no maps, no or less helps, that is for some gamers to stop the game unfinished. Graphic is fine and play length for me too, even sometimes it could more details. The secret fake walls and all the secret stuff (like strong bonus enemys if you get all cues). Sometimes are places like air laby where you get really annoying on some place but this are only a few to test your reaction/ timing and play will. To find your way, all weapons, cues and get level 40 (i would love a bit more areas and levels or some god weapons for 99.999 Gold and even super secret super boss Enemys) its fine. All small critic. Save often and take care of your next steps it could be your last ;) but in all th over 15 hours was great and so i give 8,9 Points. I hope you enjoy it and dont give up till the end :) It was Trading Cards and Steam Achievements (could be some more ;) ), so enjoy them. I start now Labyronia 2 and hope it has the same fantastic quality like part 1. For that less money its worth to test it yourself or look a review/ lets play.			",2535,1136,73,265,297,25,355

												Unfortunately, I can't recommend this game.  Despite the extremely cheap price, there just isn't enough here to keep me playing after an hour and change.Story is cliche, combat is mundane, character abilities aren't that interesting, playing with one char isn't that engaging, and while it isn't terrible, it's too generic to justify continued play when there are so many other compelling games out there.If you like most any rpg maker game that isn't terrible, you'll probably like this one.  If you only prefer the ones that are unique, you're better off looking elsewhere.			",16,30,0,37,4,0,5

												I've put what I consider to be an incredibly fair amount of time into this game, and cannot recommend it.I'm nearly to the 3rd crystal (out of 4) and still don't have any more party members? Turn based fighting is not fun when you only get one turn. Way too many of the areas are way too large to have fun in. There is no way to guide yourself, you can only walk in directions aimlessly as you guess on how to get to the next location that you'll spend an entire 60 seconds at. And then after passing that area, you'll be greeted with another area equally as large and as boring to traverse through...but this time? It's a desert, and you'll dehydrate and get sent back every 5 minutes. Seriously, who thought this ♥♥♥♥ up? You've had ""fun"" before, right? Is this what it looked like to you?Skip this, and maybe check out Labyronia 2. I haven't played it yet, but reviews seem to say they fixed a lot of these problems.This first one is entirely skippable, though. I couldn't even summarize the story for you, because it was boring and nearly non-existent.			",102,120,0,8,5,2,6

												Labyronia RPG Review - Raymond KTI usually am a fan of retro RPG style games, but this one is well different to put it nicely. It's best redeeming value is that it's cheap enough that you're not throwing much away to buy it, but the simple fact of the matter is that the combat system is dull and uninteresting, and it really doesn't try to make itself worth your while. Just not much of anything there to like.  I have a lot of nostalgia for SNES era RPGs. But those games relied on their stories to make up for their lack of expressive graphics. Whereas here the art and sound are maybe the only positives for Labyronia. The music was solid. The visuals are decent. And the special effects can be quite good. But the story. The writing. The game system. The grinding. The backtracking. The mazes. All abysmal. This is what leads me to my conclusion, if you dont like classic JRPG's then dont buy this game, if you DO like classic JRPG'S still dont buy this game (not even for 29 cents) since there are RPG-Maker games out there that are tremendously better than this pile of below-mediocracy and are available FOR FREE.I would love to see the RPG-Maker-Community getting more attention, but not through meh games like this.(If you want to try a commercial one i advise you to look at To the Moon on Steam or just google one of the various Rpg-Maker-Sites for free ones)			",106,29,6,13,24,1,11

												Very charming, short RPG. The world is small, but because of how its structured (around labyrinths!), navigating it can be puzzling, but usually in enjoyable ways. The characters aren't particularly impressive, but as this is the first game in a series, it can be expected that they will be further developed in later games. The exploration (which is almost always rewarded with rare treasures) and the lore (books to read are scattered throughout) are, in my opinion, the strengths of Labyronia. The combat isn't particularly impressive, but there are certain fights that will require strategy, usually in the form of utilizing a specific ""cue,"" the game's version of spells/arts. Criticisms include the aforementioned lackluster character design/development, a few glitches (specific interactions with a few choice NPCs that essentially freeze the game), and the confusion that comes from navigating a few of the game's looping areas (namely Alathar and the Desert of Illusions). Eagerly anticipating the sequel, should it be released on Steam.			",37,86,0,25,10,0,2

												*pre pre note last line sums it up**pre note--if you've enjoyed games like the old legend of zeldas on gameboy or games with a few small puzzles this is espcially geared for you* I got this game and it's sequel and another game in a $.50 bundle.  I looked at it it's page and thought this looks like it's going to be complete S*** if yuh know what I mean.  Anyway, I was incredibly mistaken.  The story is pretty well written.  The turn based combat mechanics are very smooth and enjoyable (for it's type of game ofc course).  The travel system is pretty alright, you go from traveling very slow early game (on the map scale that is) to very very fast so you can retrace your steps later and get goodies you may have missed.  The In zone travel however gives a toggle/held dash option which makes makes it feel like a pretty fast paced game even though it's meant to be taken slow when going through the dialouges/readables.   Took me about 15 hours to complete (with small help from a guide and yes their are a few good guides incase you get stuck like i did for about an hr because i'm a goofball and yes i have like 20 hrs i left the game on when i went to the store and made dinner  don't judge me >.<).  If you do things optimally it's about a 9-11 hr game which is well worth it for me.  So yeah just pick it up if it's bundled with it's sequal for like a dollar or less.			",55,7,0,11,1,0,2

												At first it was not too bad of a game. However the farther you get the more impossible the game becomes. You seem to make boss battles geared towards the player losing without any chance of coming close to winning. My game has halted with the battle against Nefer. With the enemy only vulnerable to water magic, physical attacks do average damage, Nefer cast a spell to lower your magic attack and Nefer cast a spell to do regeneration. The enemy is now fully capable of withstanding my attacks indefinitely, since the recasting of spells occurs at exactly the moment the spell wears off. This also occured in a previous battle. Otherwise it has its good points and bad. I think the desert timer with such a large map is overkill. Without being able to complete what may be an important part, my current rating is 5/10. I will endevour to carry on without completing some parts - I just don't like having to repeat an area.			",16,43,0,24,0,0,1

												From me I give this game a 6/10, I would have given i more stars if this game actually had a certain motive or mission after you leave your house. But no, not a single hint about where you are meant to start. The storyline is quite well written but the leveling system is quite unfair. There are some monsters near your house that can one-hit you. I found that a little unfair since these powerful monsters are spawning next to your house. This game is great and really fun once you get into it and are at a pretty good level. But I found it quite annoying that you have to grind so much to just get to certain areas without dying. Although the leveling system in this game is quite harsh the storyline and characters are qutie well done. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of RPG\'s and has a lot of patience (grinding and leveling up). Other than that this is a great game, it is worth the money.			",44,4,0,1,3,0,3

												I was not expecting this to be a great game knowing it was made with RPG Maker VX Ace but I did not think it would be this bad. Frankly I did not go far enough to know anything about what the story would be like because playing this game felt like a chore.      This games combat uses much of the defaults included in the software with noticeable changes such as parts edited on enemy battlers which were not too bad, no playable character sprites on screen and the usual Attack; Defend; Magic; Item actions. The problem with combat is that I had one character the entire time and it was mostly me using the same attack commands unless I had to heal. I can only say that the good thing about enemies is that they are run-into except in the over world.      Another problem is movement. I was never sure where to go to progress the story and I got stuck twice because I was navigating through mazes rather than dungeons with multiple paths that are easy to identify if your are going the right way or have already been there.     I do not recommend anyone play this game even as to view an example of the execution of peoples creations with RPG Maker VX Ace. There are other games made with this software that can be played for free and if you want RPGs that may be worth it, play those that are over 10 years old like those this game claims to be inspired by or what I recommend: Suikoden II.

												Labyronia RPG is a classic turn-based RPG in the style of Chrono Trigger and the earlier Final Fantasy titles. As an RPG fan, there is little not to like in this title. There is world-adventuring, dungeon-crawling and puzzle-solving. There are small villages and larger towns, each with their own style and feel. There is lore to the game, revealed in books and scraps of paper throughout the game. Hidden in caves and dungeons all over the map are rare items and secrets, and players should take note of anything unusual they see to come back to.A fundamental aspect of the combat are Auras, derived from Cues found around the game world. An example of this might be an angry chef, who gives you the Cue for a flame attack. These Cues are scattered all over the place and serve as a fun and lasting impetus for players to really explore every nook and cranny of the world.The story is sparse and anodyne at first - stay with it. It really picks up, especially towards the end. I feel like the developers really caught the atmosphere of world-changing events well. The climactic boss battle felt grounded in the game world's events - not only difficult, but meaningful. It felt as if the outcome mattered, and the sense of reward when beating something which makes you feel that way is exactly what I play videogames for.The music was great, even the omnipresent world music I never tired of. The enemies are varied and interesting, a far cry from the re-coloured skins of Final Fantasy eg., and helped give the dungeons they inhabit their own distinct atmospheres.My only negatives with this game were as follows: the lack of direction - often I was very unsure where I was going and what to, and I could see how this might put a more casual gamer off; the confusing maps (looking at you, frozen field, forest and desert) that take far longer to traverse than should be necessary, and SPOILER  the baffling decision to only unlock your second and third party members in the last fifth of the game. Why?!  And then MEGA SPOILER  to lose the third member before the final boss battle! So you take pains to prepare, building a balanced team, only to lose a member for the duration of the fight. I laughed when it happened, it was so unexpected and silly. Some players may also have trouble with the game's difficulty, particularly at the start. All I can say is to stick with it. Longtime RPGers should have no problem, and more casual gamers will certainly find that grinding for a level or two or finding a new Cue will make once-impossible foes much more beatable.If you take the time to look past the admittedly minor problems, you will be rewarded with an entertaining, nostalgic game based around a solid combat mechanic and set in a colourful, vibrant world. I finished the game in one 12 hour playthrough and there is still more to do. For its price, Labyronia RPG is a steal and I would highly recommend you buy it.			",88,27,1,17,5,0,7

												I would definitely recommend this game.Pros:- It doesn't lie, it literally is a mix between Pokemon/Dragon Quest.- Hours of gameplay, due to the traveling and NPCs to talk to.- Stunning graphics for the type of game that it is.- Hella fun.Cons:- Could do with a character creation, classes etc.- SO MUCH TRECKING.- There's not really a quest system, you just sorta go with the flow.All in all, this game is fab and I'm glad I bought it.

												Nice game i liked the way you acquired powers and companions + if you know the item location its a fast game otherwise exploration and a keen eye is required if you want to play this alone with no help, anything could lead you to progress. That's at least how I felt about the game. Anyways the twist is ok and the map size + lots of lore that's what I like to see in games lots and lots of books with lore.			",171,34,5,34,23,2,16

												Its a fun game but a very hard one, it isn't for everyone and it surely isn't a pick-up and play game, you have to spend quite a few hours before you can even start to progress in the story, you have to grind alot which is where I think you spend most of your game time. If you want a nice and easy retro style RPG with updated graphics then this isn't it, it requires alot of waiting but when you finally hit a certain point in the game that you have been working towards for ages it is so rewarding for example hitting 1,000 gold, reaching level 10, having your inventory stocked with superb gear.If you want to spend hours in a game and have fun with rewarding gameplay then BUY this game!! if not move on.

												As an advid rpg player and avid rpg developer for my second project it's one thing I've learned is that you DON'T make HUGE maps that endlessly loop especially if you have to back track.  Labyronia has a few of these maps, and unfortuneatly you have to rely to the ""voice of the community"" to navigate your way out, which is sad.  There are no images of maps either...I've looked.It's one thing to make HUGE maps it's another deal if you make them LOOP endlessly.  I'm just glad the developer was SMART enough not to put random encounters because I would have been DONE at that point.Thank you community for helping me out navigating Altahar snow area, unlike the developer's keen sense of common sense, you've helped me out.  Thanks!Aside from that, the battle system is well done and balanced although you have objectives the game is vague at times about it to figure things out.  Great use of tinting and weather effects which I enjoyed the most.  I will finish this game however, I hope the developer learns their lesson with the second game which I have but not yet played.  You just don't design badly made maps this way. ",154,28,1,39,3,1,4

												First the game dumps you at the start, no directions are except for the fact that you need 4 elemental crystals of sorts.Then without any kind of directions you are just ""left"" there to find it all out for yourself.At some point you come across an ice area (where you can be stuck for hours if you do not systematically search the place.To make matters worse there is a similar area, but this time it's a desert..... which is even bigger it seems.The game is fun, until you are forced to comb every inch of an ""looping"" area to find GOD knows what, so you can move onto the next.

												I'll keep to straight to the point this was confusing from the get go. It’s one of those RPGs where the aim of the game is to grind and get somewhere. For me it felt like constantly being stuck in a maze even when you're out of a dungeon.The gameplay itself is good no technical issues, decent animations and good build for developing character. But it is difficult where encounters usually result in death and save points are limited to certain areas. That takes away the desire to push forward as it’s easy to get stuck in a loop as well as a maze. It’s a clever game that rewards true RPG players but to me it wasn't worth it. Maybe I'll go back to it with a guide but considering the amount of RPGs out there it’s easy to skip this one altogether as at least they have some sense of direction and a more meaningful story.

												For the RPG fanatic who likes to explore.        Positives:                    It is not expensive.  ($1.99)   [I bought it in a bundle; so, I believe it was even cheaper.)                 Protagonist and other characters are likeable.  Goal is admirable.  Story is fine.         On the Fence:                    Open world... or is it?  Where am I going?  Well, I can't fight that yet.                 Location investigation: it was tedious.  But there were clues.  There was exploration.     Negatives:                   It was a tedious game.                   The final boss fight is ridiculously hard.  It seems like you are required to obtain the proper skills in the game to succeed.  ""Not fair.""  The ending... ",41,5,0,6,1,0,9

												Pretty simple, but still quite fun RPG. The game uses some basic RPGMaker assets, such as the mountains and trees, but the art is much better than a lot of the custom assets in other RPGMaker games I have played. And I really appreciate that it doesn't spend the first half hour of the game on exposition.You start the game, you grab your sword, and you go out into the world.This is a very good way to make a game IMO.The combat is punishing and attacks have decent animations. Minor annoyances are that the games seems to have no option screen to rebind keys or change resolution outside of the typical RPGMaker F1 keybind. Resolution is limited to fullscreen or a small window. On my 360 pad the action key was on X by default rather than A, which took longer to figure out than it should have as I assumed my controller was just being stupid instead of trying all the buttons like a sane human being. I would've preferred to change the keybindings in game, but I can deal with the RPGMaker menu.Overall I'd say it's worth your time if you don't like handholding and are a fan of RPGMaker titles. Solid game and pretty darn cheap even without a sale.			",624,165,8,93,53,5,70

It shows a lack of creativity and extreme laziness. 1.99 is about 1.99 too much topay for that nonsense.I hate it even more when they put the game on the foreground and you cannot go do something else while you harvest the steam cards. No windowed mode, no options menu to change settings. Basically, when you're about to go to sleep, you have to leave it running, then come back and turn it off and uninstall it.

The pixels look nice, and i love the old school 16bit feel.Then i went outside my house. I was in combat! YES a chance to test my sword!.It as a snake, or a python. He hit me 4 times (in a double attack) for 200 hp, i swing for 90.I died on the FIRST trash mob, from a random battle. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. B/13, what is this i dont even.(EDIT 8/16) Got lost in the first ice dungeon, Boss is a fairy with 7 jellyfish. (who can blind on touch) and the party is still only the main character. I miss my one attack, i get hurt for 7 attacks. The fairy has a buff that once a turn the damage doubles. So if you dont kill the fairy, FAST, you will be destroyed within 6 turns.

												I bought this game in a really cheap bundle, which included two of their other games, thinking i got a good deal. What i'll say is: no wonder it was so cheap.The movement is clunky and unresponsive. The graphics look bad. The story isnt very intresting. I cant find ANYTHING good about this game. I guess if your japanese and were born in the 80's you might enjoy it, or if you just enjoy old school RPGs. But even for an old school styled game, its awfull.I'd like a refund.			",48,6,0,4,9,0,1

												Worth buying if it's on sale and you're looking for an RPG to kill some time. The battles are a little clunky, but the game makes up for with with the story and exploration from my short time trying. Thumbs up from me.If it helps any, I made a quick video of my first time playing

												I was looking forward to playing this RPG as the videos and screenshots looked pretty good to me.  I booted the game up and was greeted by a super tiny window and title screen.  I decided to jump right into it anyway, and after a short intro screen the game introduced me to the Options menu.Great, I thought.  I can finally get the game to run in full screen. Well, the Fullscreen option did not work without a ton of screen flickering which made my eyes hurt.  Luckily I saw an option in the menu to reduce screen flickering, so I figured I'd try that one.  Nope, the option to reduce screen flickering did not help alleviate this problem.So then I decided, I'd turn down the resolution on my monitor, and give it another shot in a slightly less super tiny window.  I did a little bit of exploring, checking out the first nearby town and talking to some of the people.  After a couple of random battles, and visiting a shop I decided I wanted to adjust my control options.Adjusting the control options isn't a straightforward task.  It allows you to re-map your controller to different keyboard letters in the game, but doesn't actually say what each button does.  I figured I'd just re-map the buttons a little bit and I'd have it set up to a somewhat tolerable level to continue to check out the game some more.  Unfortunately after I re-mapped the buttons, the game bugged out and was unplayable.After booting the game back up another time, and confirming that my previous control settings were saved, I decided to plunge in one more time.  The first thing I noticed was that the changes I made in the controls screen didn't actually make any difference in the game, my controller still did the same things.  So, again I continued to play the game further constantly telling myself I'd just have to get used to the controls because I really wanted to check out this game!After wandering around for another 10 minutes and finding the first place I was supposed to go, I died valiantly in battle due to pressing the wrong button.  Then I decided that I was not interested in this game any more. As for the rest of the game I haven't played enough of it to review. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If I Had A Nickel For Every Time I Wasted 30 Hours On A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Game, I Could Buy This Game - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]This review is inspired by The Angry Video Game Nerd, Jeff Dunham, and Adam Sandler.It's 20-♥♥♥♥ing-16. Almost 20-♥♥♥♥ing-17. This game's release date is 20-♥♥♥♥ing-15, but that's only one ♥♥♥♥ing year and this is still un-♥♥♥♥ing-acceptable.Do you know how many games I have in my backlog? Too many. I have a problem. I spend too much money. I'm hungry, there's not enough food because I spend my money on games. I told you, I have a problem.I filled a plastic bag with dead grass from my neighbor's lawnmower and sold it to middle schoolers. I spent that on more Steam money and like some Taco Bell. Sorry, I'm getting off-topic. The topic being that I am very upset.You see this game? You see this ♥♥♥♥ing game? It's aight. But ♥♥♥♥ it. Okay? ♥♥♥♥. It.Labyronia, or Labyronia RPG as its referred to just about everywhere I see it, is a quaint little PC game available through Steam. It's an RPG, which is probably why they put RPG in the title. Most likely. Though that would imply there was a Labyronia something that wasn't an RPG. I hope there's nothing else. I really do.""Labyronia is an epic RPG, heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy VI, and the Dragon Quest series"" according to their game's description on the store page. I really don't get why they gotta go name-dropping like that. Like your game is worth a ♥♥♥♥ing nickel, dude. Don't get all uppity. I got a whole bundle of your ♥♥♥♥ for a nickel, actually. Labia RPG 1, Labia RPG 2, and some other ♥♥♥♥. Heavily inspired my ♥♥♥, boy, sit down.Labia RPG is one of the many retro-style RPG's churned out of the RPG Maker engine, allowing even you to make an RPG if you really wanted to. Anyone can do it. Even... Squidward's house.I have a problem with Labia RPG. A number of problems. There's nothing wrong with being a retro RPG churned out of the RPG Maker ♥♥♥♥ factory. That's totally cool. Some cool stuff can be made with it. The problem, though, is an RPG that struggles to capture the interest of the player with any discernible hook of any kind.I gave it a chance, I really did. I didn't want to write ""lol this game is a nickel it so bad that it only a nickel"" and for that to be the whole review. I wanted to give it a chance and play it through to the end to see if the story ever took off, or if anything interesting ever happened, but it failed on every front.Labia RPG is a bit of a mess. Its battle system could use some balancing, that's for sure. It's awfully grindy, in all of the worst ways. It brags about its ""semi-nonlinear world to explore"" which is pretty much dropping you into an RPG world without telling you what to do, despite there being one or two things specific you need to do. No, I don't expect a trail of yellow sparkles like Fable to literally guide me throughout the entire game. But I'd like something besides ""lol just walk around you'll find it"". Talking to NPC's, anything.Worst of all is Labia RPG's abhorrent dungeon design. They're all literal mazes. Like the back of a family restaurant place-mat. Subtle landmark cues lighten a laborious task of navigating them if you can figure them out, but there's still puzzles buried in them without enough clues to figure them out. I'm a fan of puzzles. I love puzzle games. Puzzles in RPG's, sure. Puzzles in adventure games, sure. Puzzles that don't respect my ♥♥♥♥ing time? No.I don't have time for Labia RPG. In a day and age where there's tons of 100-hour RPG's with much better storytelling and gameplay mechanics than this, this is ridiculous. I have way too many RPG's in my backlog with much more appealing gameplay. There's no hook to Labia RPG. It gives me no incentive to press on and figure out its poorly put together puzzles or grind through its dungeons. The game is a chore. Grinding itself is a chore because within the first hour of playing the game I ran into an enemy on the world map maybe once, forcing me to enter and exit dungeons repeatedly to kill the enemies that only spawn once in each room.Unless you're that ♥♥♥♥ing neckbeard that never shuts up about only liking retro RPG's, there are better games worth your time. RPG's are a time investment. They take time to play, time that not everyone has or wants to spare. I'd love to give Labia RPG my 50+ hours of gameplay, but it failed to hold my attention for longer than an hour. And I tried to give it more. I pushed on, despite very much not feeling it. And what did I get for it? Nothing. A Steam ♥♥♥♥ing Trading Card. Thanks, Labia RPG.The writing didn't even impress me, and that's usually something that can hold together even the stalest RPG experience. Generic fantasy mumbo-jumbo that's too wordy for its own good. A cliché Final Fantasy-esque elemental crystals plotline written by the guys that do the endless paragraphs of lore for Dragon Age that no one ever reads.Unless you're looking to play a game to beat your meat to because you're such a retro RPG fan, don't bother.I'm such a retro RPG fan, I love playing games that look like they were made decades ago. This game's bare-bones art style that uses the bare minimum of assets dragged and dropped from a fair use game assets bin out of a cookie-cutter RPG game engine really gets me hard. I loooooooove the fact that I have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue what to do, it's just like when games were poorly translated from Japanese when I was like 8 and didn't know how to ♥♥♥♥ing read in the first place. I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually, there's no school on Monday because of Labor Day so I have a three day weekend. I can just spend the whole weekend in front of my TV with a bowl of Froot Loops and figure this cluster♥♥♥♥ of a game out, it's no big deal. Retro RPG games like this are the only games I can play. You know Final Fantasy IV was the best one? Because it ♥♥♥♥ing was. That was the real Final Fantasy. Everthing after that was so dumb. I miss the old Final Fantasy, when they didn't go to the future. I like games with, like swords and ♥♥♥♥. Do you ever, like, swords? You know? Retro games really are the best. I hate all new games. Yup, they just don't make them the same like they used to.This game is the equivalent of walking on a treadmill naked, for 30 hours straight without stopping, in a plain white room, in the middle of Siberia. It's something to do.But you really don't get anything out of it except having exerted yourself in the most basic of ways to take way too long in order to accomplish absolutely nothing.I already get enough of that every day of my life.

												Edit: You can downwote me as much as you like but its an unbiased opinion as I am not an RPG lover so its just facts and if you are offened by this as an RPG fan well I dont give a crap. This game in not epic but it could been better so just :dealwithit:.I got it from a GamePromoters so I didn't spend a penny on it.I am not a huge fan of RPG 2D but something new is always awesome to experience. 30min gameplay.Price worth it? Yes, if on sale. If you are only looking for high end RPG 2D then I wouldn't suggest it unless you like spending time to figure it out how things work.Is it a polished game you will have no trouble playing? No, its controls are some sort unfinished as I tried to take a screenshot with default  F12 and it kicked me back to the main menu without saving or even warning. You can read books but you cant navigate the pages (like back and forth). Also it doesnt have a map or any type of warning system that you are going into a high lvl area where you will be killed straight away. A very simplistic game without any fancy work done to make it an epic RPG as I would say it.THE BIGGEST thing I hated is that it runs in a tiny window which you can't fullscreen or stretch & on my 2560x1440 it only took like 1/16 of my screen.I will be playing some more so I could had misunderstood or didnt figured it out how it really worked but for now thats it.

												This game seems to be yet another RPG adventure maker product, really I dont understand why these games still exist or even get listed in steam. Sure it can be fun for ppl to play these kind of games, when we were 40 years back in time. Nowadays these games should only be played on an ancient gameboy and not on our powerhouses :)Don't get me wrong, I acknowlegde the work put into this game but unfortunately it goes to waste by the limited capabilities of the adventure maker software.One possitive point though, the music is nice :)Definitely not recommended by me but if you are into Zelda like games from about 40 year ago then you will probably have a blast!

												This game is pretty fun and challenging. I wasn't sure what I was getting into at first with this game since it was an rpg maker release. But I like it, and the soundtrack is fantastic. Amazing music. The one thing I wish there was more of though, was that there was a guide or something. That way if somebody has no clue where to go, they can get a push in the right direction. I tried the forums, but no one ever replied to me. -_____- so I'm stuck. but maybe a guide will come out sooner or later. Hopefully, sooner. fun game so far and cool storyline/concept.

												This game is a reminder of games of old such as Dragon warrior and Legend of Zelda combined. How so you may ask? The Legend of Zelda aspect comes in the open world travelling and talking to n.p.c.s.  The dragon warrior aspect comes from the combat system, meaning you fight the creatures in duels that have you in a first person mode during the duels. Villages and farms are also a big draw as they add in the old Dragon warrior aspect of visiting each village and purchasing equipment and gear to build your character up.			",81,8,2,20,7,1,10

												[My First review of a game so It is kinda sloppy...It has humor though!]First off, I wanna say that this game's story will have you staying up extremely late/early just because your human curiosity tells you so. That being said, I am writing this review after a good half week of playing Labyronia 1 and 2 (With an all nighter in between). The game does have a slow start, and decent back tracking, however I got very lucky and found a lot of secrets while wandering around, only using a walkthrough 2 times.  In Labyronia one, you take control of a curious Battle mage known as Arres, Who wonders too much about his life and what the hell he is even existing for. So he finds answers by traveling the beautiful vibrant world of Labyronia. Arres becomes so OP I sometimes believe he is on par with how powerful the Final Fantasy characters are. The game has like I said a slow start, however once you're baited to play you will take a while to stop. My hours do show a bit more than other reviewers, however I took my time without a walkthrough and was overleveled + destroyed the optional bosses. If you choose to play it, the game will hook you on it, and it reminds me about how good a story can be portrayed through an RPG Maker Software. Oh also people with purple eyes are Over powered in life. Arres and Purple guy from fnaf prove it!!! ",23,4,0,3,2,0,0

												It is RPG at its core, since you do not have someone telling you what you should do; you have to find it out by talking to people, exploring, learning spells from the environment, reading the specifications of the objects, interacting, etc.Just follow the clues and you will be fine!Note: I bought this game in a bundle, for like 25 cents... the game is short, but is ok for the price ",45,10,3,9,3,1,2

												Labyronia is surprisingly huge, and involved, for what it is -- a cheap RPG maker game. However, the length feels a little artificial to me simply because so much time is spent to walking (veeeery slowly) across the main map. Overall though it was worth the price if you have time to spare, though not groundbreaking.Cons: It's obvious early on that you're meant to gain a party, but this happens SO late in the game that it's disappointing. If you leave the game for a few days, or just don't have a great memory, it's pretty difficult to figure out what the heck you were doing; the NPCs don't often repeat plot info if you talk to them again, and you have no in-game way of checking progress. After a certain point, I also found that none of the fights were really a struggle -- I can't pinpoint why I'm feeling that, but I know especially the 'end game training area' was almost laughably easy IMO, since the fights could be won just spamming attacks, since the monsters end up doing little damage.Final con: I just didn't get that invested in the story or characters. Cut scenes could be annoyingly long, with weird long pauses that made me think the game was broken. There is a ""romance"" that I found just laughable.Pros: However the world is pretty big! Which I enjoyed. Which frustratingly maze-y at times, that was the point. Similarly, the lack of clear instructions (aka, closed off areas, ""Go north now to do the next task!"" style directions), espeically early game, I enjoyed since it felt more organic as an adventure, while there were still mechanics to more or less guide you to the right areas. The fighting was pretty well fleshed out, though nothing groundbreaking. The graphics were pretty good (except for some reason Ann's character portrait makes me think of evil dolls, idk) and the enemies were nicely varied.Bottom line, if you like explore-y (j)RPGs that let you figure things out, and have time but want to save some money, this is worth checking out.My in-game time is around 15 hours, but it would probably be a little faster for many players since I did a lot of backtracking and so on.

												The game is easy to play, the tips on the forums make a good walkthrough.I enjoyed it for 45 hours and recommend it for ff fans and games of the genre.The main weakness of the game is the scenario: no humour, the characters are not very attaching, the story is rather flat, no chocobo, moogles, card games and the like.Also more than half of the gameplay is with only one character, it would be more fun to have sooner additional members to the party.Anyway, I spent 45 hours on it and was happy to win it. Given the price it is an excellent fun / price ratio, and I will try the sequel soon.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For a dollar or so, it's worth it.  The story is a generic RPG story and the ending is pretty good, definitely makes me want to play the second game.  There are moments of the game that are frustrating as a lot of labyrinths and little direction; however, the guides found in the comment section and YouTube helps overcome it.  This is like the dollar novels you used to see in the shop.  Nothing special, but good for it's value as it has at least 7 hours of game play (more when you get lost a lot like me).

												Yeah...  I played a little.  😂Labyronia is that classic RPG game,  with lots of puzzle solving. It needs a lot of patience to solve,  but nevertheless the story and plot is exciting. It gives you that wondering effect,  and makes you intrigued. And yes.  There is a bit of romance.  Eh...  *pokes the girlsYou'll love it.  Cause I know I do.  ✌			",19,5,0,4,5,0,1

												I really enjoy playing this game, it's something which you can easily play for about 10 minutes before you need to leave and then stop. For the price id highly recommend it and the bundle too because if you are a fan of the dragon quest series then it's like a cheaper version of that! The only issue I have is how hard it can be sometimes to find enemies in the wild that's my only dislike about this game			",90,9,0,13,20,1,6

												I enjoyed this game a lot. It's really challenging, the music is pretty cool and the story is entertaining. I'd say the game is worth your time. The only thing I can complain about is *minor spoiler* *minor spoiler* *minor spoiler* that you play like the first 70% of the game with only one character and no companions whatsoever. Other than that, a full recommondation. 7/10			",51,13,6,8,2,0,3

												FYI: This game says it has Gamepad support. But you can't change the buttons around although it has the options to do so. Secondly *You must turn the Gamepad ""ON"" before you launch the game for the pad to work correctly. After having that said, this game is just like any other JRPG. If you like'em, get this.

												Quite a fun RPG.Some tips: in the overworld, the kind of enemy you can encounter depends on what terrain you're on. Especially while you're still a low level, there can be quite a big difference in the difficulty of enemies even in two adjacent terrains (or two types of enemies you can find in a single dungeon). Make sure you save frequently, especially when you are first testing the difficulty of enemies in an area.Also, the name of the game is ""Labyronia"", as in labyrinths. Expect the maps to be confusing and that it might take you a little while to get a feel for them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I finished the game with almost all complete. Its a good RPG, the story was enjoyable and with a medium difficulty, for me. Pros:- Nice story and develop of characters.- Searching for ""cues"" to get new skills was a nice touch, it's more fun than just kill and kill monsters to get lvl up and better skills.- The labyrinths are great!, some of them meticulously done. Also I liked a lot how there was explained the background history of the game and the relation with labyrinths .Cons:- RPG maker make things ugly, the visual part of skills was generally poor, except for the last part of the game (in which there are ones with nice visualization).- The characters visual aspect was poor too, it seems the creators used predefined templates for making the faces... :/.- lack of skills: it would've been great if the game would had more skills and maybe more complexity in the strategy part of fights...It's a nice and cheap game, I would have paid twice or triple if the visual part would've been better			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Pros:- The need to use ""cues"" (aka your spells and abilities). You won't beat this game if you just melee- Difficult enemies during the beginning and middle of the game. It's nice knowing they aren't all the same level as you- Your typical world is in danger, must collect gems/crystals/orbs to save it story.Cons:- Backtracking to progress the story- Backtracking to get cues- Backtracking to get items- BACKTRACKING!
