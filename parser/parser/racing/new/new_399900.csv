												One of the Best Devs I worked with, He was willing to spend the 2 1/2Hs in Skype with screen sharing, log sharing, and code sharing to work out the issue on the community downloads not working. Everything works as intended now!!!Ever wanted to know what Cool Boards 1, 2, & 3 on the PSX would be like on the PC.. This is it.. Let the nostalgia beginControls 4/5 : Simple to use on a xbox360, a bit more trickery with the keyboard. Sound 3/5 Music isn't bad, Sound Effect are basic. All it all it works for the game.. It keep ya going.Graphics 3/5 Its above average then most Unity Games have.. Nothing special but nothing ugly ether.. The Gameplay makes up for it allGameplay 4/5 This is where the game shines.. The game play is solid...for the most part.. Sure, due to some Level designs and the limitation on the Editor you can find yourself doing all sort of weird stuff like shooting right outside the level at ridicules speeds.. The game play is a blast, from speed runs to Racking up trick points... and with the community made levels the replay value is through the roof.. never a dull moment...oh can’t forget the Local 4 players at once on the same screen.. This is a great little party couch game just in time for every one looking at getting a Steam link/machine. oh did I mention the LVL editor... board? build your own. Easy to use..All in all  despite it being built on unity (unreal would have been way better IMO) this game is worth the price tag, from unlimited replay value, Pick up and play and local multiplayer. the only thing missing is Online play.Overall 4/5			",1484,601,91,238,249,12,198

												This game doing a lot of fun, is a very fast descent on the track with many twistsThe jumps proves to be very demanding, I needed several times a distance to ever come to the finish			",2373,935,89,256,310,25,367

Teal DeerDevelopers: Denis Lapiner Publishers: Denis Lapiner Initial release: Sept 2015Genre: Snowboarding, Racing#Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationI rode a banana down a mountain as a monkey. I was hoping for some sort of approximation of an SSX game in this. I've wanted a decent snowboarding game on PC ever since I can remember. This... is what I want? Stay with me. This game FEELS almost good. It ALMOST feels like an SSX game. I think this game suffers a bit from what I call the Coolboarders syndrome in where you remember it being good and enjoying it. But in retrospect you didn't. Not at all. And enough time has passed where you only remember thinking you had fun. Only that all happens within minutes.This is a mobile port with some added controls which is fine. There are plenty of great mobile games, the platform itself is not indicative of poor quality. Although maybe for the genre it is. Overambitious. The game is very simple. It works. The UI is very large and very bubbly for obvious reasons of mobile gaming. There is a split screen multiplayer. But in all honesty I'm not sure why you would do such a thing to your friends. You might not use that as a designation for each other afterwords.There is also a level editor that isn't terrible; it is sufficient in making a level that is noticeably different than other ones. The thing is, this game is trying to hard. Its trying to do everything and thus only does those things sub par if at all. Everything is functional at best. I was truly surprised when I went back to visit the store page to have it revealed to me that this was not still in early access. What even more surprising is I have had more enjoyment from this game than SNOW. But that story is for another time. I am honestly torn about this game. It feels good. Sort of. Good enough. Its silly, it has the strange and goofy characters needed to maintain that sentiment. It reminds me a little of TrackMania in the way that if this game had a larger community there could be a plethora of insane crazy stages that mess with the physics and probably some other ideas that people who are more creative than me can come up with. The thing is, its kind of a barren wasteland. And for that reason I cannot recommend this game without that level of curation or group of creators backing it constantly making new levels. And in all honesty I don't see it developing that audience. It needed that from the get go. You can't manufacture interest I suppose.THE GISTThis game is totally fine as a product that exists and can be purchased. But for many reasons I HIGHLY recommend that you do not purchase it. Go eat a sandwich instead. You'll come away from that experience much more fulfilled. Pun intended.Follow my curation for more ",1041,295,48,106,93,7,96

												Ugh. Like probably everyone else that bought this game or had it wishlisted, I was hoping for an SSX-type of game -- in my case for the open world racing, as I don't care about tricks. Unfortunately, with those expectations in mind, Mad Snowboarding ended up being a huge disappointment.Note that I only played this for about half an hour, but it says something that by the end, playing to see what else this game offered was was quite a chore -- I would even characterize it as painful. I was bored out of my mind. In the levels I played, the world was very plain and dull. It isn't as ""open"" as it looks, and I quickly ran into ""walls"" when going not that far left or right. This is basically a really, really boring demo.In my case, I bought this as a spare bundle key for about $0.20, so I'm not crying. But I would definitely encourage anyone wanting to pay full price to watch a lot of videos of this game and reading some of the more critical reviews before pulling the trigger.Again, I only played half an hour, but half an hour into a game ... if it is that painfully boring, I find it hard to believe that the game would change dramatically after that. Maybe those creative types who enjoy designing stages and playing user-created levels will get more enjoyment out of it.Seriously, why doesn't EA bring the SSX series to Steam? Even a port of an older SSX game will do. As it is, I suspect a lot of people will pick Mad Snowboarding up on sale to satisfy their SSX itch and end up disappointed.1/10			",721,283,47,114,46,8,71

												Do you like open world games where you attempt to reach the finish while trying to do awesome stunts in the meantime?If yes this is the game for you.I might have not played that much due to not having any free time ubt here is my opinionPros:Has multiplayerHas co-opHas a lot of modes to playHas level editor (this makes the possibilities endlessIt is a great time killer for people like meIt is great fun to play even by yourselfGives you the option to play with a joystick and a keyboardControls are easy to get used toCons: It might be a bit pricy for some peopleOverall this game has a lot of potential and it can be a great way to spend your free time.I would give it an 8/10.Now lets go to thethings i would personally like to see be added:Currency:You get it throughout the map in the from of coins/shards and it is used for trading in a Yeti shop for new boards,cosmetics,single-use powerups for better scores or even map packs with a bunch of cool stages.Wildlife:Animals like bears or penguins running around making you fail if you bump into themBoss-type stages:A giant yeti chases you with a snowboard and you have to outrun it and finish before it catches you/Escape an avalance or types of stages like that.Thank you mod for making this awesome game and i hope you consider my ideas worthy of using.Keep  up te great work			",29,4,1,4,1,0,0

												Are there worse bare bones Unity games? Yes. Does that mean Mad Snowboarding is worth $8.99? No. If only a little more work had gone into it to make things more complex and interest, it could be a decent budget title. Hell, it could be a decent budget title I'd happily give a thumbs up to if it was much cheaper, but frankly, there's a sea of better stuff you could spend that money on. Mad Snowboarding just does not give you enough bang for your buck.			",87,9,2,2,1,0,2

 Small personal opinion (review complete in Italian):  The game is still in its infancy, I hope that the community create other levels as those inserted are very few.Also there are still problems in the commands, which are to be improved and the launch price unfortunately does not help, but future updates can improve everything, because the game is quite fun and well done.  Rating 6/10 -----------Mad Snowboard è di Snowboard game molto folle!Bisogna usare ogni trucco possibile per raggiungere l'obbiettivo, nel gioco c'è la modalità ""editor di livelli"" dove è possibile creare il proprio livello e condividerlo con la community.Il gioco integra anche una classifica online dei punteggi più alti ed è possibile giocare fino a quattro giocatori contemporaneamente , in modalità split sceen!Feature:Mondo Aperto (i livelli si possono finire in molti approci diversi)Editor di livelli, si possono creare i livelli4 Giocatori in split-screenClassifiche, Replay e modalità fantasma5 Personaggi sbloccabili ( in base all'esperienza)Parere personale:Il gioco è ancora in fase embrionale, spero che la community crei altri livelli poichè quelli inseriti sono molto pochi.Inoltre ci sono ancora delle problematiche nei comandi, che sono da migliorare e il prezzo di lancio purtroppo non aiuta, ma futuri update possono migliorare il tutto, in quanto poi il gioco riesce nel suo piccolo a divertire.

												I figured that I would try this out, being a huge SSX fan. It is closer to 1080 Snowboarding than SSX, but it's pretty fun. It's too bad that EA hasn't made an SSX sequel in many years.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
