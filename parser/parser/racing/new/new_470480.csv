												A new action game by EasyGameStation, the studio behind Recettear and Chantelise. With such a pedigree, there's a lot to live up to! It's a sidescrolling race/combat game, similar to Speedrunners, Rush Bros., or Sonic Rivals. It's score-based, you earn points for getting hits on monsters and other players, by collecting goodies, or by crossing the finish line first, and you lose points for dying or falling behind. Each type of gem you pick up slightly increases your speed, acceleration, or defense, depending on its type. The translation is by Rockin' Android (instead of Carpe Fulgar), and for the most part is competent, albeit not as gut-bustingly entertaining as Recettear. There's the obligatory typo in the first cutscene, but I haven't seen any other errors yet. The kerning is all messed up, but doujin games always tend to be like this. You're only allowed five letters to name your character with, and there's no default character name, but I suppose that's only mildly annoying. There's a ""newletter"" you can read after every stage, which contains gameplay tips and a novelization of Chantelise (although the character's names have been relocalized for, I assume, licensing reasons). The music is good, although the invincibility item throws off your groove with every use, resetting the stage’s music. There isn’t any annoying voice acting. I’m happy with my purchase, overall. I’ll rate this game a $7.49 out of $9.99, which makes it a steal at just about any sale price.  ",1751,692,73,232,219,22,303

												From the makers of Capitalism Simulator comes a new side-scrolling adventure:  Mailman Simulator!Ever wondered how news gets around in all those fantasy games?  Curious about those who cross the land rain or shine, snow or sleet, slime or 'shroom?  Well worry no longer as you take on the life of a Messenger!Brave the dangers of the world to deliver your charge.  Jump over obstacles!  Stomp on 'shrooms!  Smash blocks!  Even go on an invincible technicolor rampage!  (Wait a minute....)  All in search of a pay-off that you're not even sure exists!So what are you waiting for?  Seriously.  These letters aren't gonna deliver themselves.On a slightly more serious note, it actually is a pretty fun side-scroller.  Starts off simple enough but has a nice growth in complexity as you go on.  Certainly seems like it'd be fun to mess around on with friends, as multiplayer is supported.  Different level types include time-based runs, versus battles, and occasional special challenges.  Wouldn't say it's as complex/involved as Recettear, but it's still its own fun little game.Capitalism Courier, Ho!			",92,39,2,25,13,3,14

												Disclosure: I marked “received this product for free” because I obtained it through a giveaway.Admittedly, Angel Express isn't the type of game I typically play these days.  It is a cute anime style sidescrolling racing platformer created by Japanese doujin developer EasyGameStation.  Several of their games are on Steam (notably Chantelise and Recettear) but were published by a different publisher (Carpe Fulgur rather than Rockin' Android).  Strangely, the developer on the store page is currently listed as Easy Game Station instead of EasyGameStation which probably makes the game harder to find for EasyGameStation fans.  Anyway, I'm a fan of platformers so I decided to give it a shot.The player takes the role of a messenger girl on her quest to become an Express Angel.  It's fairly light on story, but what's there can be humorous at times.  You race through each stage as fast as you can maneuvering around obstacles and sometimes competing with other messengers.  After you beat the game, additional stages and branching paths open up.  If you want to reach the final ending you'll be required to beat the same stages multiple times.  They're pretty short though and mostly easy once you get the hang of everything.Each stage has an objective.  There is some variation but most of the time it will be to beat the stage within a time limit or to win a race against one or several messengers.  Not unlike Mario Kart, there are plenty of items that can be used to your advantage.  Some are offensive, some defensive, and others are speed related.  The main character can be customized.  You can select her outfit color, dash style, and class (once additional classes are unlocked).  The class bonuses are small, but one of the ones I found was very helpful for traversing the stages.All of my playtime was spent in the single player campaign. It appears the game features local and online multiplayer, but I have can't say how well it works as I had no way to test it out.  If it works, I imagine it would be quite fun.  I encountered several bugs while playing single player, so it wouldn't surprise me if there are some issues with multiplayer.  There wasn't anything severe enough to prevent me from completing the game, but the game crashing on start the first time I opened it felt like a harbinger of things to come. I found a few minor bugs and one reproducible crash bug which fortunately wasn't connected to the actual gameplay.  I imagine it all would be quite easy to fix, but the fact that it hasn't been fixed gives the game a sloppy feeling.Despite a few issues, I enjoyed my time with the single player campaign. It took me approximately five hours to do a blind completion on normal mode.  Assuming multiplayer works, it wouldn't be hard for me to imagine someone getting more time out of Angel Express.  The graphics and sound are reminiscent of Dreamcast era games, which may or may not be an issue for players.  Personally, I thought it was fine.  I'd recommend this game to fans of Mario Kart and people that really enjoyed playing Gourmet Race in Kirby Super Star.			",147,28,2,20,10,1,3

												TL;DR - It's an adorable sidescrolling racer that's a throwback to charming Japanese-made Playstation and Dreamcast games visually. With cute-but-chunky 3D visuals, bright & colorful textures and stylized background art, it particularly recalls games like Klonoa or Threads of Fate. If you were worried about controls or something, don't be. This may be simple but its well made. Angel Express is just a fun, simple little game. And its a pretty unique spin on the platformer. If you like the looks of it, and enjoy games like Klonoa, don't hesitate to pick this up! What is this? - Angel Express plays like a hybrid platformer and ""kart"" racer. You can jump, double jump and use a dash if you've built up enough juice to use it in your special bar. The heroine generally feels pretty good to control: she's speedy enough, responsive, collides with the environment correctly, stops well, has a good jump & double jump, and a good bounce off of targets. So with a solid feel under its belt but just a small group of core game mechanics, the Pickups are where some gameplay depth is served up... though its still a pretty simple, pick-up-and-play type of game overall.You race through a stage 3 times (for laps), picking up gems and items from treasure chests, while avoiding traps and enemies (or stomping them/using items to clear them out of your way). The levels are even destructible to a certain extent, so watch where you're throwing those bombs ;) Every area has two unique tracks, except for the last area at the end of your run. There, you'll find just one track, and you'll have to fight a boss. Angel Express also features a world map with branching paths that opens up after you complete your first playthrough too; more on that in a bit.How is it? - There's a nice selection of levels with varied themes, a cute little story (told through short asides between stages), and multiple stage types. Some are straightforward ""just beat the level before the timer runs down""-style challenges. Others may change things up with environmental effects such as adding fog to decreases visibility. Several stages pit you against your rival. Some pit you against multiple opponents, and then there are the bosses. The boss fights are not always races; you'll have to do battle with some of them by avoiding attack patterns, gathering treasure chests and then unloading items onto the boss.The progression is a little weird, as you don't have free reign on the World Map. You'll be run through 4 stage courses straight to a quickie end. Then you continue that game, and head down the world map again, this time taking different branches throughout your runs to see more stages and endings. Its kind of like Outrun, how that game would start in the same area and then give you different end points depending on which forks you took throughout the race? That's how Angel Express' World Map works.Any downsides? - The momentum makes it hard to slow down and actually land on 1-block platforms while racing, and the collision tends to get messy in VS races when colliding with other players, and also on certain traps/items - namely, the spinners. I also saw slowdown whenever there were more than 2 messengers running. Heck, there'd be random, minimal, slowdown during those 2-player races too, but its far worse in 3 or 4-player. Its like playing the whole stage in bullet time... which is actually pretty okay. It just made it easier to react to, and appreciate, all the chaos going on during those stages, honestly. Any little annoyances don't really equal frustration or even difficulty; you shouldn't have to retry a stage more than once or twice to actually get through any of them, and the punishment for losing is... getting to try again. This may surprise you, but this cheerful & colorful adorable game isn't big on punishing the player :P  Wrap up - That's really all there is to it. Fun races and challenge types, with a good little chunk of levels to play through, plus the ability to make your own. This won't be clogging up your backlog; you'll actually be able to get through this in a few hours, but it'll all be enjoyable. This is bright and cheery, with cute music and characters, and a solid, charming script (honestly, there's far fewer misspelled words than I ever would've expected. Good work, devs!). This is the kind of game not a lot of people make anymore, and when you pick this up, you'll be reminded of how sad that is. This game is a gem for fans of instantly fun arcadey action and pure positivity.------Notes about the Level Creator: It's pretty good. Its kind of like a basic Mario Maker; you scroll through the stage and drag and drop elements  from a menu -- your tiles, blocks, traps, gems, enemies, etc. -- onto the grid to make your level. It's pretty intuitive. The only thing that's weird to me is that there's no ""instant test"" option; so you have to Save it out, then leave Edit, then go to Time Trial, THEN select your ""Edit Stages"" and pick it there to try it out.

												Game Background:This is a 2D platformer time attack game where the main goal most of the time is to finish the set course within the given time. You finish the course by getting to the end goal on the rightmost part of the stage and completing the required number of laps.  Along the stages there are monsters and obstacles which will try to hinder your progress.  There are many tools that you can collect to help you clear a stage. Some of its effects include destroying walls (bomb), make you run faster (carrot) , make you invulnerable and smack any monster you go into (cake) and many more.Sometimes during the adventure, there are other AI players you will encounter, for this type of challenge you need not only to clear the course within the time limit, but also make sure that you have higher points than them, otherwise you can't proceed to the next stage.Story:The world the main character lives in has seen a rise of monster population in recent years. Because of that, the letter delivery industry is having a hard time to their job. To combat this, they begun hiring messengers, girls who can see spirits, to deliver all kinds of letters to any location. Because of the aid of spirits, they have little trouble passing through monsters.The main character (which you can name whatever you like) is a girl who aims to get the mythical title ""Express Angel"", although the circumstances to get this title is somewhat unclear. Along the way, she will overcome various obstacles, and meet friendly(?) rivals, and who knows, she might actually get the mythical title.What I like:Basically this game is fun. I like platformers myself so... anyway this game is fun because of the time mechanic, it's like you're already playing a speedrun for every round.  The controls are smooth too, even by using the default keyboard layout I didn't have any problems during in-game. This game can also run on any toaster due to its low requirements (my current PC is still a toaster, but I'm upgrading soon lol.) The graphics are 3D, not too realistic but the world itself is full of bright colors. The characters are modeled after the ""Chibi"" style (or SD or etc.) The game also has story cutscenes which are alright. The humor reminds me of Gurumin, where the narrative pokes fun at the setting itself. Most of the in-game stages are well made. What I don't like:There are few issues about the game. The ability to change keyboard controls is not present, even though I tried my best to look for it on the game folder, or in-game. If there is a way without relying to 3rd party software please do inform me. So if you are not familiar with Japanese style keyboard game layout (arrow keys + Z key), then you might need to play this with a Steam controller or any other gamepad (I'll try my arcade stick next)Overall:If you happen to like platformers and racing against time, then this game is for you.  The stages are interesting and the game is easy to pickup. Although having the ability to change the keyboard controls would be better, if you have a gamepad then you can play this with no problem.

												Meh, just another runner game that reuses the same polygons repeatedly. There's only one character model reused with different color variations, and four stages also recycled. On a positive note there's some story interactions between stages that are somewhat amusing, and a boss fight, which is surprising. This game is better off as a mobile game tbh, it's a time waster nothing more.			",217,46,7,35,2,0,1

												The game is ltierally broken. Several reinstalls later, I can't even play the tutorial. Tried several online fixes, and just nothing. Maybe jsut my experience, but I do have a fairly beefy PC. I was enjoying some of the visuals, but having to restart my computer every time I want to fail to start the tutorial is a deal breaker for me.			",152,91,2,43,16,1,10
