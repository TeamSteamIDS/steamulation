												I am talking about this game after playing GTR 2.As for this game, this game is very well developed, the car handles perfect and the tweaking system of the cars is even more beneficial than ever before(previous updates)The number of cars in the game is few but we cannot easily forget the modding scene regarding this game. As for me, a friend of mine gifted this game to me. I got the extreme edition including RACE 07 DLC, RACE 07 and GTR Evolution. Due to all the three contents, the selection of cars and tracks increased a lot. Addition of Nurburgring(Track) via GTR Evolution was must since every racing game is considered incomplete due to it's absense.As for the ingame physics, the game is far better than Need For Speed franchise which emphasizes on ultra quality graphics and High end cars rather than ingame physics. Cars handles and feels realistic and the engine sounds are very similar to the ones in real life.Because this is an old game, the multiplayer lobby mostly remains empty but if you are lucky, you will find a server with 15-14 players. Don't hesitate to buy it, the amount of ingame content is anormous and the modding community is still growing at an amazing rate. Cars, tracks feels lively.Buy this game and if you own any steering wheel controller for pc, it will act as chocolate syrup over the existing cake.Go on, buy it   :DThank you all for reading, and thanks to my friend for gifting me this :D			",89,12,5,8,9,0,11

												It absolutely does not metter because this game is released 2007 i give it 20/10 ( lol ) why ?It's a simulationIt's one of the best simulation i have played so farEverithing feels right when i play itIt's good optimized ( sure it's old engine of the graphic ""dx9"" but still avesome )Never got any lags or problemsAI drives like humans do , fast , agressive but they doing mistakes to , it's nice to see when they spin out of a track the same way and for the same reason like you can spin out = BalancedThere are so much Racing Track's and Cars to select and  race them , but the best is , you can find on several websites Fan made customized tracks and cars for free , most of them look's much better than the original game tracks / cars.It's compatible with a lot tipes of steering wheel and with a nice settup , full enjoyable with a Xbox 360 Gamepad.RecommendedIf you like a simulation , and you don't care so much about a ""new un-optimized graphic engine like they have nowday's , where you constantly crash becouse the game is not optimized good and you get a micro lag by driving on 300 km / h "" then this game is definatelly worth the cheap price to have it in your collection.I Definatelly Recommended.

												By itself the game is fun once you learn the car handling, but the online community is extremely hostile to you and anyone new to the game. You're new and don't quiet know how to handle it yet? Kick or Ban. You learn it and drive properly, not even being an crashing ♥♥♥? Kick or ban just because ""free key"". You wanna spectate the people better than you? NOOO!! Not to mention everyone just quits mid-races and it doesn't matter if they are in the first places or the last places, they just do it even if theres still 5 laps to go. Additionally, you can't join Games that are in progress of a Race so you end up racing against no one or your buddy given that quitting behavior.			",516,165,16,48,30,5,69

												I've played for years and it is absolutely the best racing simulation out there. Well optimized, I've never suffered any stutter or lag whatsoever. Graphics may not be absolutely cutting edge by todays standards, but there is certainly not anything lacking in the visual department. ( The actual game looks much better than the promo videos, believe me ) I do find that user made skins available at mod sites generally look superior to the stock car skins. Cars have excellent physics and feel, controller set-up is easily customized to suit your style of controller and play, car setups can be finely tuned with many many variables which accurately mirror real-world tuneability. Alternately, pre-configured set-ups are available online. There are a huge number of different cars and tracks to suit any skill level or particular interest, Everything from high-downforce open-wheel racing, to touring cars, minis, etc etc. I prefer the vintage sports cars myself, the Retro pack with GT Legends mod brings me back to the golden years of vintage sports car racing. The modding community is still very active, there are too many user made cars, tracks, skins, and effects mods to list, which add a lot to the game, and are not very difficult to install and run.In summary, if you are a racing enthusiast and you don't have this game, you are really missing the boat. Don't expect any ""yo dude, that was so gnarly"" as in, say, DIRT2. What you are getting here is pure racing, and nothing but. At this price, you're stealing it. So get it, and drive it like you stole it.Is it easy? No. Are you going to jump right into the most powerful car and dominate the competition? No. This is not an arcade game, it's a simulation. There is a learning curve. You may learn that you actually suck, at first anyways. Ever watch racing on television and think; ""hey I could do that no problem""? Here's your chance. Think you're fast? Find out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Race’07 is simply a must to any real sim racer’s library. It is quite simply the best touring car experience out there. I've put hundreds of hours into this sim, most of which doing competitive league and championship racing at Race2Play.com. The features and details this sim has to offer, especially at the time of its release, were second to none. Comprehensive tire model, very rich setup with (most) cars responding very well to the setup changes, best FWD touring car or similar experience to date, windscreen and visor bug splats/mud with helmets having tear-offs, lots of good add-ons (particularly Retro Expansion!) which gave a variety of cars and more tracks such as the entire Green Hell and a barrage of GT1 - GT3 content with the GTREvo expansion.The GT car physics are sub-par, I'll be honest. GTR2 was much better for these and GTRE fails to exploit the same GT experience. The formula cars are kind of a hit and miss. You really need to dive into the setup to get these feeling correctly, but the FMaster and FRR are really fun when you do. Unfortunately the Formula cars in this game use GT car brakes! Grand Prix length events with the FRR, even with full brake duct and lower pressure, will overheat and destroy the brakes. Because they overheat at 600C like the GT brakes, instead of overheating at the F1 range of 1000C, which they can easily reach with higher ambient temperature and heavy brake-load circuits. Unfortunately having my brakes fail in two Grands Prix cost me a very prestigious drivers championship at R2P so I remain bitter about that flaw.But all-in-all the setup depth and complexity and telemetry coming off the car, the amount of cars and the detail put into the individual physics for each (even model-by-model in classes!) is amazing, the detail of the tracks including the bumps and undulations of the surface make driving a F1 or GT1 car on the edge in league racing incredibly intense, and just.. yeah. It's a sim, not an arcade game. If you take the time to learn how to setup each car, push yourself to be consistent and drive it like a sim - drive it like you would a real car - setup your FFB to really feel the front suspension weight transfers this is a driving sim experience like no other!

												Make sure you at least have a controller that can be plugged in to your computer. Otherwise you're going to have a bad time accelerating, braking, and turning.Like the game says you're going to have to accelerate/brake lightly majority of the time, and you can't do that with a keyboard. If this was an arcade racing game, it would be different.Game: ""Dude, you have to do stuff with finess. Here's your chance, turn left lightly.""Keyboard: ""LEFT!""			",160,18,7,16,17,1,23

												My first impressions of Race 07 when I picked it up was that it would be a cheap little sim that I wouldn't put much time into, 60+ hours later and I belive it is safe to say that this has become my go to racing game, the game offers a large mixture of closed and open wheeled cars and that's before you get into the modding community for it. The modding community is still active and mods are still being pushed out any, and I mean any, racing series or track you can think of can more than likely be found either through offical dlc, which is pretty good, or mods.I would reccomend this sim to any racing game fan no matter what level of experince or preference to series as, like I said, you can find anything you want through mods or dlc.

												To be clear from the start Race 07 is a simulation game. That means to play it, it is recommended to have a gamepad or wheel. Trying to do anything without one of those is a waste of time.To start off with there are lots of annoying things, the control setup is tedious (but it works), the settings are sometimes overly complicated, people online can be ♥♥♥♥♥ (if I had a cent for every first corner accident...) and the AI opponents are mentally challenged.However once you've set up everything correctly and connect to a multiplayer server (preferably with some friends) the game is great. For people who like 'real' racing the gameplay is great. Cars handle like they should and once you know what you're doing close racing is very much possible.Also because of the driving aids people with different skill levels can easily compete with each other for fun racing sessions.From there on there is a myriad of tweaks and settings to change to get that extra bit of speed out of your car, I am not interested in that but for the simracing enthusiast it is great.To conclude, there are some small issues with Race 07 but on the whole it is the best sim racing game available on Steam, period.

												Shortly after getting off of GTR 2 FIA GT Racing Game (wrote a review for it), this was the next game I attempted at, and by god this one is much better!As I continued my urge to play some racing games, this one was next on the list of downloaded games. Coming right from GTR 2, this game is the exact same, but vastly upgraded and runs so much better. As I had previously stated in my last review, there was major graphical issues with it that straight up broke the game. This one I was able to go max settings and still run at 120 FPS smoothly. The menus were much easier to navigate as well. It only took me about 20 min to set up all my settings were the last one took an hour. The 1 music track is boring and turned off the music instantly.I got in and did a few races and had a blast. I only experienced a few crashes trying to select a few cars, but otherwise no problems. One big thing that I strongly agree with is that this game supports mods! After finding a guide with links, I was able to add in 30+ cars and 70+ more tracks into the game!This is a game that I plan on keeping on my PC for when I have more urges for a racing game. Strongly recommend if you like Racing Simulators!			",986,298,40,103,74,9,150

 High Quality Racing at a Low Price  Race 07 is an absolutely amazing racing simulator, for a cheap price too. Though this game was released in late 2007, It is still very relevant and challenges many new games that are released. I have not a single complaint about this game. I would even call it one of the best racing simulators on PC when all of the expansion packs are installed.  I actually received this game as well as the GTR Evolution Expansion as part of a Steam key giveaway a while back, but I can tell you that I would gladly pay double the price of the game because it is so good. I enjoyed it so much that I recently purchased the Mega Bundle that contains all of the expansion packs, which I definitely recommend you buy. I've already had hours of fun with this game, and I can assure many more are to come.The physics are great, the AI is pretty decent, and I can't complain about the graphics. With a wheel, this game is even more realistic. There are dozens of preset controls for multiple wheels, including the G27 which I have been playing the game with. If you get bored of Single Player mode, there is always a multiplayer mode, which is still quite active for an older game. The drivers are sometimes sub-par, but you really get that in any online experience. Overall, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a bit of fun. It has a cheap price, so there really isn't any reason to not buy it. I give it a 9/10.			",32,2,27,3,17,0,1

The best part is that you dont have to pay monthly fees, pay for cars or tracks, an so on. The ""newer"" sims like AC or RF2 just suck up your money and require a powerful computer.

												I used to play GTR2, then I tried this as it is the secuel of the previous, it didn't attract me at the begining, but then I purchased the expansion: GTR evolution, I strongly recomend you to try if you are looking for racing simulator.Diferences between GTR 2 and RACE 07: in GTR 2 the car seems more light, more difficult to control, the game charges much faster even if not optimized for parallel computing. RACE 07 is a bit more easy to handle, making it more accessible to everyone, the graphics would say are a bit better, not big difference, just fine for a racing simulator.

												I literally have zero cons for this game. Get the game + all expansions, its one of those lifetime games, where you could play it in 10 years and still enjoy it. Easily top 3 actual racing games (I mean racing, with pits and 20 laps with a realistic full grid of cars and an actual season, with whatever tracks you want, using any car catagory) on PC and probably top 3 racing games of all time for me. As much as i love the graphics of GRID and GT and FORZA, this game I can race 20+ laps and have pits and feel like im in an actual race. Bumper to bumper and fighting for every corner, provided you put teh Ai high enough for your personal skill level. I'm not a bad racer and 95% Ai gives me a very solid hardcore sweat filled competitive race with asteering wheel. Whereas most racing games GRID etc, you have 1 race, have some fun, but theres really nothing else to it. There's no intense championship seasons in most of those games, accept Codemasters F1 and perhaps DIRT RALLY. Race 07 is like a slightly more realistic version of TOCA 3. With mods and V8 Supercar and DTM mods you can download from around the web , plus tons of other mods and a brutal Ai if you stick the Ai on 90% or higher, its endless intense racing , doesnt matter how old it is now.

												NOTE: This review includes notes on expansions aswell.With 800+ Hours played, I think it's safe to say that this game and it's expansions is one that will last the test of time.It may not have the following of other racing simulators like rFactor or iRacing, but this is easily up there with some/all of the best.It has a great racing community if you find a relaxed group of racers (RaceDepartment are great for clean racing and no lock-in racing series). The choice of cars across all the expansions is perfect for online racing. There really is something for everyone, from slow and nimble Mini Coopers, to high powered open wheel racers, to classic and modern muscle cars (Race On expansion).My favorite part of this game though is it's single player section though. It's ability to play and create championships makes this a great single player game, along with the fact that the AI is actually rather smart to race against compared to other games.Modding is also fairly popular with this game as is evident by sites like NoGripRacing and RaceDepartment, with various add-on cars and tracks all waiting to be played.Since this is a racing simulation, it is definitely a greater experience to use a wheel. I highly recommend getting yourself a wheel if you don't have one yet as it will change your experience entirely.If you don't play racing games that often it's more than acceptable to use a gamepad, it's still good fun but not as good as with a wheel. The game is drivable with a keyboard as well, but that's a last resort.In short, it's definitely worth getting the whole package: Race Injection, GTR Evo and Race On. It's perfect to me...For games as a whole, it's easily 8/10.For racing sims, it's 9/10.			",65,8,17,3,14,0,9

Name one game on the market that allows you to actually use Pit Strategy, Tire Wear, Fuel Consumption, and take into accout car damage while you race? There isn't one. There is no game that allows you to customize your race with so many options and also include your friends in those custom races. After racing for so long you forget the visuals and the first impressions. All you want is a game that plays well and has the options, cars, tracks and longevity you want in a game.

Race 07 is probably one of the best racing sims on the market for the money.If you're looking for a realistic racing experience, look no further. I managed to pick this game up and all of its DLC for about a buck each during a humble bundle, and I have loved this game ever since. Although it may not have the aesthetics of modern racing sims, the graphics hold up incredibly well, and can easily be optimized for any system. The many different cars in Race 07 feel completely different from one another, and handle much like you would expect them to. Open wheel F1 style cars can corner with ease, assuming you can control the massive amount of power they contain, while heavy muscle cars provide an interesting challenge in the bends. The controls can be fine tuned to your liking, whether you own a wheel or a gamepad or just have a keyboard and mouse. For only $3.99 (at the time I'm writing this) you'd be crazy not to buy this game if your a fan of motorsports. Just remember, your not buying a crazy, over the top game like Need for Speed or Burnout, your buying a game with a pure focus on racing.			",93,4,29,11,30,0,8

												I own Project Cars, Assetto Corsa, Stock car Xtreme, Dirt 3 and now Race07.How does it compare......its brilliant, next to assetto corsa & project cars the best racer among the above games....why?...cos feels like you are driving a car, there are loads of options, frame rate is great, graphics are excellent, loads of cars and competitions, supports G27 wheel with no issues and its cheap! On top of this its great fun, AI seems to be intelligent and gives you a great race, you can modify the AI strength too or use set defaults like easy, pro etc. I bought the bundle including retro racing pack , the old minis are awesome!

Race 07Is Race 07 a good game?Before we get into whether or not this game is good or not, I should start off by saying this game is quite old. Meaning this game is quite outdated and the only things that will be fixed or updated are possible bugs that may arise.While this game is impressively old, it also manages to be one of the better racing sims you can buy for the price of chips at Walmart. Seriously, this game is dirt cheap. This game is so cheap it makes a ring out of macaroni and cheese for a marriage proposal. The advantage of it having a low price gives it quite the advantage in the value for money department.The graphics may not be the best but the gamplay is almost second to none. While the multiplayer aspect is almost dead, there are a few servers that live even in the abandoned town that is Race 07. One being 100Mbit; 100Mbit is a server I've raced on for a year now and I've had a lot of great times racing on the server. Races have been won and lost and battles have been sparked no matter how dense or empty the grid may be. You can't just jump straight into 100Mbit though, you need to get some practice in the singleplayer and learn to be cautious and friendly to other drivers. Not to mentioing giving them enough room to race instead of simply running them off the road. Once this is done, let the fun of being in a competition begin.There is still much to enjoy about this game even without the multiplayer, as there are quite a lot of track mods you can download and have a go with. Such as some Mario 64 race tracks to have a go racing around.There are other games that I think to be the spirtual successor to this game, games such as Automobilista and Asseto Corsa. However, if you want a game that is cheaper than a brand name pillow from JC Penny's.....This is your game. ",16,2,16,2,3,0,0

												The 'Race' series comes from a little Swedish company called Simbin, not the most evocotive name. But when you take the entire series as a whole, they have created an absolute master piece of PC gaming.Race 07, the core game of the series, is primarily focused on the WTCC (World Touring Car Championsip) for 2007, along with serveral 'support' series you can race also. Having learnt leassons from previous racing sims, Simbin have just kept adding to the game, & despite the final collection numbering near double figures, the game is still stable, reliable & entertaining as day one.The one thing that should grab the attention of serious racing-sim fans is the fact that behind the less glamourous series' is in fact nothing less than a licensed version of the rFactor engine, a sim that has gone beyond being a game, it is tool that is even used by top racing teams to train professional drivers!Once you have the full works of the Race series, you can race everything from Caterhams, MINI Coopers, WTCC cars of various series, Formula BMW, GT cars, muscle cars... The number of different cars on offer is quite astounding.However, the real bonus to the Race series is that Simbin have left the game entirely open to being heavily modded, & in fact, have made allowances for making the game easy to mod, from car skins, to tracks, graphics tweaks to entirely new cars that have never existed in the game. Despite having added a huge number of mods of various types to my install, the game remains stable & utterly reliable, something that could quite easily be the make or break of a modding favourite.On the downside, you pretty much need the whole hog to ensure mods will work, meaning you do have to commit to it. Also, given the quality of the 'sim' part, if you don't have, or never intend to, get a steering wheel, don't bother with it, you'll just be wasting the game & not getting the full experience.It adds up to a game where you can race almost anything you want to, on pretty much any track you like. There are even online racing clubs who use the game.I've reached a point where I actually wouldn't even consider buying new racing sims as Race has everything I need, with all the quality & realism of a truly great game that could only be this great on a PC.

												The same goes for GTR Evolution and RACE 07.This game is eternal. A true masterpiece. 7 years after its release this classical car racing simulation is not obsolete and will never be.GTR Evolution / Race 07 has it all: decent graphics, awesome physics, solid AI and huge content. The game – no, the simulation – is highly customizable. It can thus appeal to both beginners and hardcore simracers.During Steam Sales, this game is simply the best value for money of the entire racing sim universe.What do I need to play a car sim ?Racing wheel is not mandatory. But a game pad is a must. X360 controller works fine.Wait ! 7 years old and counting ? How about online ?The online community is tiny but robust. Anyway brand new sims will soon suffer the same situation.Add-on content ?There are a lot of add-on contents developed by the community. Especially tracks. But generally no setup is provided for the different car types. And it takes skill and time to create a good setup. But fear not ! Even if you stick to the vanilla game, you can enjoy hundreds hours of play thanks to so many tracks and car models.Yet I want add-ons ! Free add-ons !Simbin has released two free DLCs:Formula Raceroom (Formula 1)Andy Priaulx Crown Plaza Raceway (track) ",97,7,7,20,8,2,18

												Don't be deceived by the age or the price of this game. It's very good.The amount and variety of content puts many later titles to shame, and so does the AI.For the first time in a long time, I can race the AI without simply strolling through the pack or watching a single file of cars disappear over the horizon leaving me to hot lap alone. In addition, I have yet to be rear ended or shoved off the track by the AI, no matter where I am on track or how slow I am going. If you have track position, the AI will respect that as best it can, however if you try things like cheap late dives up the inside, they will hold their line and you will get clumped. This enables you to battle with the AI for fun under proper 'Queensbury Rules', which is how it should be.The only other game I can think of at the moment that has AI close to this is Stock Car Extreme.In addition, the AI cars also have their own little battles between themselves from time to time which helps greatly with the immersion and I have yet to see any AI cars get bunched up and stuck anywhere. (Quick Tip: Don't max out the number of AI cars when you race. Keep the AI numbers on the low side and this will further help to avoid congestion.)Graphics are fine, and with a little graphics card tweaking (anti-aliasing in particular) it can be made to look very nice - not photo realistic, no - but still nice looking. Smooth and and clean.Force feedback is also good if you take the time to tweak the settings to your liking. One advantage of being an older game is that there's plenty of information on the internet to help set up most wheels properly.Kudos also for the clean and clear user interface. Everything is laid out logically, and setting up races and competitions (you can also create your own custom competitions by the way) follows a nice logical flow through track and car selection to get you to race day.So, if you're at all frustrated whilst waiting for a fix or patch on your latest photo-realistic uber-racing sim, do yourself a favour - spend £2.50 on this and have some serious fun in the mean time.Highly recommended.P.S. I've spent quite a bit more time playing this game than the numbers above would indicate, before writing this review. :)			",7,0,7,0,1,0,2

												First of all, this game is fun. If you're into racing and a bit of simulation, this is really a game you shoud get. There are tons of cars and maps, and decent graphics. If your not into racing, don't spend the 4 dollars. If you don't give a crap and want to try it, you might like it. It's a fun game. And if you have a wheel, it makes it a ton better. If your looking for a cheap racing game, than look no further. If I were to rate this game, I were to say 8.5/10. And no, this is my personal rating, and not IGN :)			",72,4,7,4,8,0,1

												Hmm what to say about this. Now do take mention that this game is started to show its age. Its an amazing racer, the standard content is greater but the community really made it shine, there are thousands of mods for this game so you can have a car count which rivals that of even behemoths like granturismo. honestly there could be moments where you are just messing around looking at the different cars instead of actually racing. The online community has gotten a lot more bitter since this game was given away for free. For the price tag you will struggle to get better bang for buck, maybe from gtr2 but personally i prefer this to the gtr series and the layout seems to be more friendlyAnyways remember that this is a sim racer so spinning out, blood and tears will be things that you will encounter from time to time and there is a learning curve, some will enjoy that while others will headbutt a wall.The graphics are dated as it came out in 2007, the main problem is that the anti-aliasing sucks big time. If you have a nvidia card throw that DSR on and downsample from 4k. Amds VSR works in a similiar way but as of this review it works only with the 290 series which is a shame as i have a 7870 xt.The bottom line is that this great while great is started to lose its touch, the newer games of the racing world namely Assetto corsa, Iracing, Rfactor 2 and maybe Game stock car are the kings, they have great physics but also have great graphics and many believe that Assetto corsa will take the crowd and be the spiritual father of Race 07. If you want a great racing game but are strapped for cash this is a uncanny deal, if you are balling and want to make it rain, get Assetto corsa. ",287,101,36,76,28,0,27

The high level of customization can make the game to be played almost as an arcade or, if you're a fan and have a wheel, very close to a simulator experience.

I tried it without the wheel so I used the keyboard, it wasn't as good but I still enjoyed it the same. Get this game!			",14,6,10,0,19,3,7

												Very good game, very good value.Although old, Race 07 is still a very good game with a good amount of content. I got the base game + all DLC on sale, but even at its regular price Race 07 is a game worth buying imo. There's a good number of car classes & track locations, enough to keep me busy for a long time, and on top of that the game supports mods. Race 07 doesn't have as many mods as rFactor1, but there's still enough to provide a lot of variety to the game.Race 07 has a number of options for practicing & setting up custom races against AI, as well as custom championships. One can do a championship with full race weekends and realistic rules or simply setup a quick race with whatever car/track they want.I'm playing the game with a Xbox 360 controller, controller support is pretty good, default controller settings work well, game lets me customize button setup, driving cars without driving aids require precision but controls feel intuitive.Graphics are slightly better than rFactor1, graphics are dated by today's standards but look pretty good for a game released almost 10 years ago.Sounds are good as well, engine sounds, gear changes, collisions, etc.Overall I'm very glad I bought this game and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good racing sim, especially if they're on a budget or if they want a game that can be played on older pcs.

												This game is a good contender for best Racing game ever made. First, if you really want this game, wait for a sale, but because you should by the Race Injection Bundle. To start, the AI and physics are some of the best I've ever seen. The AI is very human, and can make mistakes and even crash. The graphics are great and hold up well, even after almost 10 years since this games release. Now here's the fun part, though the game has some content to begin with, you can easily add more through moding; and boy does this game have a lot of mods. You can race any track with any car you want, if you find the mods for it. I myself have about 100 tracks, and still counting, on my computer alone. There's online but I don't really see many people there. You'll also want a controller or wheel, because using a keyboard takes a lot of the realism away due to all the assists you'll have to use to even drive in a straight line.If you're a fan of Simulation Racing Games, but have a tight budget, this is the game for you.

												Still brilliant IMO, though has been superseded a fair few times. I recommend this (or rFactor) as a cheap way in for people who aren't sure if they want to spend a lot but want to try something a bit more simmy than Forza/GT.NB: The claimed 'over 300 cars' is 300 individual cars (i.e. a lot are the same car with different liveries), not 300 different models of car like you'd get in Forza/GT.Dig out an old PS2/3 wheel and grab this for a few pennies, and you can't really go wrong.

												Is it good YES!Should you buy? NO!   There are numerous standalone expansions to this game that contain all of this content and are equally cheapIf you like competing against your own best times (just you and the car) then GT Legends has more interesting cars.But if you want to Race against other cars and trade some paint then this game is THE one.It has fantastic AI and you will never be trapped in races that are too easy or too hard since it lets you fine tune the difficulty settings yourself.It's best experinced with a wheel but is more gamepad/keyboard friendly than most, just keep in mind that it is going to feel more klunky with a keyboard than Need for Speed or even Forza			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For less than the price of 2 pieces of bread sandwiching some sort of delicious filling, you will not find a better value racing game. Sure, it's 7 years old now, but that doesn't matter. That means even if your PC isn't crammed with the latest technology, you'll still be able to run it. If you do have a brand new, highlly-specced gaming machine, you'll still be able to make this game look good whilst running perfecly smoothly, even with 30 cars on screen.Included within are great deal of interesting and varied circuits and a collection of proper racing cars, from saloons to single seaters, prototypes, featherlight caterhams and high performance road cars. The handelling may not be entirely 100% sim-like, but it's close enough and means you can play with a controller just as well as a wheel and pedals. Lotso race options available, from 3 lap sprints to 120 minute endurances, fully tyre wear, fuel depletion, damage modelling, engine and gearbox failures, sliding scale AI so no matter how good or bad you are you'll be challenged. There's still a healthy online community playing and modding this game at the likes of RaceDepartment or ReallyRubbishRacing. And all of this before you even take into account the increibly cheap expansion packs that add even more circuits and cars to play with.Cannot recommend enough as an entry into sim racing, and a game you'll no doub continue playing into the future.

												Race 07 is an excellent entry-level simulator for the PC. It does require you to use some sort of controller other than a keyboard and mouse, but can easily be controlled with the stuff you probably already own, like a Dualshock III or Xbox controller.The expansion packs are worth it, especially GTR Evolution for us who need a bit more speed than what touring cars can offer.The community creates a lot of free tracks and cars that are excellent for making the game last a lot longer.On the downside of things, the force feedback in this game compared to earlier Simbin titles like GTR2 is horrible. You don't get that distinct feel of lack of grip when understeering, a vital thing in a game with mostly FWD cars.The graphics are very dated by now, and no mod seems to freshen them up properly. Creating your own skins do help a bit though, something I do a lot. All in all, for its age, Race07 is around an 8/10 because of the lack of proper FFB and lack of ""fast"" racing cars. GTR2 is better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The graphics are old, but as far as gameplay it's an amazing game-possibly my favorite racing sim. It's not a ''Zoom through the city raising panic while swerving from bullets, and while I'm in a maxed out hot rodded Mclaren some guy in a Ford Model T passes me"", rather, it's a WTCC (as you know from the description) racing game. It seems a little hard to find non street racing games that are good these days, but this is one I'd recommend.Pros:Quick races for the less competitive gamers, where you can still make your own championships and such but there isn't anything to lose if you, well, lose.Super fun and addictingCheap! The less money you spend, the better, right?Ultra graphics settings works on old, slower computers.Pro/Con, depending on preference: The crash physics are a slight but strange, as sometimes you'll fly up into the air spinning faster then a top, but by the same token, it's super fun to crash into walls at full speed and wach the replayCon:The graphics ain't quite Project Cars levels, if you get what I'm saying.The graphics ain't quite Crysis levels either.Or Battlefront ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great sim for its age. Loads of content with dlc although its messy as simbin never set it out properly. Dollar for dollar one of the best plug n play sims around. For a few bucks highly recommended gfx are a bit dated but physics are good . But then again look at rfactor 2 and in looks this for old title isnt far behind.			",42,7,45,0,22,0,3

												I bought RACE 07 and some DLC's on the Steam Summer Sale. I haven't played many hours of the game yet, but I can already say if you should buy this game or not.This game is totally worth it if you:A) Have a decent wheel with Force FeedbackB) Have a computer that can run the game on high or max graphic settings (I have a gaming computer, not very good, but not bad either. Can run it with atleast high graphic setting and still have good FPS)C) Can drive realistic (you don't need to be a fast and good driver, but atleast brake at the braking points, hit apex and generally control the car you're driving. If you are a pro driver at Need for Speed it doesn't count)The force feedback is fantastic in this game, and so is the handling of the cars. It feels like a game from this year if you ignore the graphics (graphics are good at high or max settings, but not the same as most games from 2013 and 2014). AI also feels nice. In this game you can't point the wheel in the direction you want to go and floor it. No, you have to fight it! It is a proper racing sim, you hear that?This game is a masterpiece.EDIT: I would like to add something that might help you understand how good this game actually is.This game is better than most racing sims released after this was released. Most of the realistic driving and racing games released the last years are worse than this. I am mostly thinking about the realism of course (AI, handling of cars, and so on).			",63,16,28,3,46,0,7

Its easy to play and i would recommmend this game to EVERYBODY. i bought a steering wheel a few weeks ago just to make racing games more awesome.

												Very decent racing-sim which is still being played by dozens of racers online. Has a big modding community - nearly every real track out there as well as various racing series are downloadable from mod sites. If you dont find a race online that is your taste, go race against the challenging KI which behaves almost like real opponents.

												Real cars, real tracks and a huge modding community. The game is pretty immersive, especially with a ForceFeedback steering wheel. It's possible to play it with a Keyboard, but analog controls are recommended. There's no ""storymode"", you can play every car or track immediately. The multiplayer and the variety of tracks and cars provide good long-term motivation, but playing on a public multiplayer server could get frustrating. Luckily there are still some active communities that host server, which are only accessible for members and provide fair and fun races. In case your favorite racetrack is missing you'll find it for download in the Internet.So if you're looking for a realistic racing game with a good multiplayer, this game is right for you. It also runs on pretty low-end PCs and is cheap ;)			",71,1,15,2,5,1,1

												First of all I'd like to mention the good stuff. The game is a great package for the money. I haven't heard of another realistic racing sim you could pick up for that little cash. It takes itself very seriously and is very driver focused. It looks like the real deal most of the time (the rules, the damage, the race weekend etc). You can also make comprehensive adjustments to your car and there's a good selection of different tracks. However the game looks like something that would come with a box of cereal, meaning extremely cheap (check the price once again). The car selection is woefully small (half of them comprising of caterhams and radicals with different power outputs). There are a lot of customizing options as mentioned, but they didn't bother to explain what kind of effect these changes would have on the cars performance or at least mentioning the basics of car setup. The AI are like oiled up bricks and don't make a satisfying opponent. If by any chance you find yourself off the tarmac, then you're essentially on rails, because you can't steer or break or accelerate. The cars themselves (mainly with stability control off) are far too nervous and unbalanced meaning they will frequently spin (especially high hp cars). This results in extreme effort put into driving clean, fast laps, but the rewards are not in any way satisying. Not once was I smiling whilst playing this game. I could kind of tolerate much of it, but the idiotic driving characteristics was the last straw - the gear you're in, affects the understeer going into a corner and also the braking distance. Also cars with maximum amount of downforce, happily skidded about. And once you start putting on a few dlc-s (to get more cars and tracks), the price climbs quickly (20eur+) and it just can't compete with the alternative titles.Overall a good racing sim if you're in need of a racing game for less than 5 eur or if you're into a challenging realistic (as good as they came in 2007) racing experience then give it a go. But there  are so many far better alternatives to this game that I don't see the need for a regular car guy to own this. ",78,25,5,7,1,0,0

												I have played several Simbin games. All of them including this one are very realistic with excellent steering wheel and force feedback handling.More so and better than most games I tried. I have both a F1 like wheel and a 900 degree typical wheel, both work very nicely and was easy to adjust in the game, both in handling and force feedback.Some well known sims try to increase the difficulty level by exaggerating greatly all damage the vehicle gets, like in overrevving for a second, there is no such nonsense in this game, it's all pretty realistic.The graphics in this game are dated but the playability is high. The AI of other drivers could be better, they are overly and unrealistically agressive. The sound is fitting but not memorable.Highly recommended and good value.Tip for beginners:Many people recommend beginners to use driving aids in sim games. I do not.If you are, say in your forties and an experienced driver in real life, go for the most realistic, just choose cars in the beginning that are similar to cars you have driven for real.When practicing, go for better time than your last, but don't try to be an ace. Otherwise you might make to many mistakes, get disappointed and loose interest in the game.. ",203,64,12,17,9,3,29

												For $3.99 the game is worth it. It has partial controller though it doesn't state so. You need the mouse to get through the menus. And you must go to control options and pick your controller. But knowing this, the actual driving can be controlled through a controller. I have a xbox wired pc controller. I like that it has a very easy practice track to get experience first before actually racing. You can tell it's an older game but, again, for $3.99 it's a good buy. However, this add-on was automatically given to you as well when you download this game. It's called ""RACE 07 - Formula RaceRoom Add-On"". I don't know what happened but when I launched it, the menus were unreadable. Like the graphics was totally off. I can't even read the menu enough to change the graphics. So I may uninstall this add-on to save space. That one I was disappointed on.The controls were fine. Not too touchy.

												Only for die hard racing fans. I mean, yes, there are all kinds of assists in this game but let`s be frank. No arcade kiddy will try this game more than once. The graphics are outdated and never look as good as in the trailers showed by Simbin. There is no career style play like say SHIFT, GT or FM. It`s just racing; season, time attack and multiplayer. Even for an experienced sim racer, this game can get really hard at times. It is as realistic as it gets. You won`t do drifting here as much as slamming into a concrete wall. Offline play doesn`t give much incentive to go on, though there are plenty of nice tracks and cars to drive on and in. This game really shines in online leagues, where other sim racing fans gather. You can tune the car to hell and back. The interiors are well made. The sounds are very good and immersive.If you ever wanted to see how it is to drive a WTCC car and don`t own one, this is the closest thing to it			",306,103,32,44,40,2,54

												Race 07 is Pretty simple racing game. It has a decent amount of content and features to keep Race fans interested, while being easy enough to learn to attract new faces. The game itself has visuals that many would consider ""dated"" but the gameplay still holds up to modern racing games. I enjoyed playing Race 07 enough to recommend it to anyone who is interested in a racing game. It is definitely worth a look.			",374,144,14,85,57,11,89

												First of all I'd like to mention the good stuff. The game is a great package for the money. I haven't heard of another realistic racing sim you could pick up for that little cash. It takes itself very seriously and is very driver focused. It looks like the real deal most of the time (the rules, the damage, the race weekend etc). You can also make comprehensive adjustments to your car and there's a good selection of different tracks. However the game looks like something that would come with a box of cereal, meaning extremely cheap (check the price once again). The car selection is woefully small (half of them comprising of caterhams and radicals with different power outputs). There are a lot of customizing options as mentioned, but they didn't bother to explain what kind of effect these changes would have on the cars performance or at least mentioning the basics of car setup. The AI are like oiled up bricks and don't make a satisfying opponent. If by any chance you find yourself off the tarmac, then you're essentially on rails, because you can't steer or break or accelerate. The cars themselves (mainly with stability control off) are far too nervous and unbalanced meaning they will frequently spin (especially high hp cars). This results in extreme effort put into driving clean, fast laps, but the rewards are not in any way satisying. Not once was I smiling whilst playing this game. I could kind of tolerate much of it, but the idiotic driving characteristics was the last straw - the gear you're in, affects the understeer going into a corner and also the braking distance. Also cars with maximum amount of downforce, happily skidded about. And once you start putting on a few dlc-s (to get more cars and tracks), the price climbs quickly (20eur+) and it just can't compete with the alternative titles.Overall a good racing sim if you're in need of a racing game for less than 5 eur or if you're into a challenging realistic (as good as they came in 2007) racing experience then give it a go. But there  are so many far better alternatives to this game that I don't see the need for a regular car guy to own this. ",78,25,5,7,1,0,0

												  Truly as marvel from the 21st century.  Race 07 is an emotional tale describing the romanting adventures between two audi cars, and the tragic tale surrounding the helpless spirit both of these cars have to endure. It has great graphics, amazing soundtrack, and a story worthy of the biggest compliments of the industry. I was in tears when both audi cars got stuck in a turn and had to understand their death in less than 10 minutes, remembering the times they add together, the bad times they pulled through, and the memories they kept close in their heart.  Race 07 is the most emotional tale I have ever experienced, and I recommend it to all of my steam friends, for it is the best storytelling I've witnessed in the videogame medium.			",56,7,3,3,7,0,2

												What a game! +Very nice physics, nice graphics, works wonderfully with wheel steering and pedal sets even if some adjustments need to be done, plenty of mods for cars and tracks to be downloaded for free in the net, a very nice price, many servers for mp racing.-Not weather and time change as in GTR2 (a strange decision), some tracks and cars missing (Ferrari and Posrsche and some others can be bought through expansions), many expansions to get the full set (but low price)To sum up, if you like sims this is the most modern and best value one. If you like arcadish driving games, buy the basic game only (Race 07) and put the assists on. Slowly you will learn to drive without them and a new world will open in front of you.8/10			",92,18,16,27,18,2,49

												This is one of the best racing games I have ever played. Also one of the hardest. If you are expecting to jump right in and do well on max difficulty settings if all you've played is arcade style games (a la Need for Speed), forget it. The touring cars are easy enough to drive decently well. If you get some of the DLC packs such as the GT cars, those things are monsters to try to handle if you aren't used to it. The online play is pretty good, but expect to be treated harshly or kicked if you aren't there to try to race properly and not ram into people and ""forget"" to use the brakes. 10/10 worth buying for any racing fan. Steering wheel recommended for best experience and playability.Oh, and not to mention tons of mods that can be downloaded online, almost any track you could want for these types of cars, and quite a few cars as well as tons of skins.

												Race 07 and its addon (I have them all) is starting to show its age in terms of game engine.  That being said, it's still one of the best racing games I've played...  If you're into modding!  Websites like www.nogripracing.com will offer loads of tracks, car skins and full championships, that you can throw into your installed folder and play with.  The game developers offered car templates for all their cars, and there is a system to create your own skins for the cars!  This is what makes me come back to this again and again.  Even with the aging game engine, being able to race against car skins who bare names of your friends and enemies, you can enjoy battling hard with AI or with other people online.  Touring Cars, Single Seaters, Classic cars, Muscle cars and performance cars are all available, depending on the addons. Great game.  Love racing, get this.			",141,3,20,12,14,0,12

												Race 07 is a highly interactive racing game that is very aged. It's post modernistic individualization of the races divide the community within 4 sub racing sections. This creates an interesting dynamic between the ""Ford Agenda"" and future gamers.  This game introduces the average gamer into racing games in the most perfect way possible.			",98,4,2,13,6,0,8

												This is one of the best racing games I have ever played. Also one of the hardest. If you are expecting to jump right in and do well on max difficulty settings if all you've played is arcade style games (a la Need for Speed), forget it. The touring cars are easy enough to drive decently well. If you get some of the DLC packs such as the GT cars, those things are monsters to try to handle if you aren't used to it. The online play is pretty good, but expect to be treated harshly or kicked if you aren't there to try to race properly and not ram into people and ""forget"" to use the brakes. 10/10 worth buying for any racing fan. Steering wheel recommended for best experience and playability.Oh, and not to mention tons of mods that can be downloaded online, almost any track you could want for these types of cars, and quite a few cars as well as tons of skins.

												Great game, especially for the price! I recommend getting the SimBin Mega Bundle to get ALL the DLC and extra stuff for $40, it's a great deal. The only problems I have with this game is the collision models, they get a bit wierd sometimes but, hey its not a demolition derby. THIS GAME IS NOT FOR PEOPLE THAT LIKE ARCADE RACERS!!!

												One of the best racing simulators to date! Recommended to be bought along with a DLC like Race Injection. Online still works which is amazing for a game which is almost 8 years old. This is a must for any racing enthusiasts out there and for people who want to try a simulator but don't have the PC specs for any upcoming games such as Assetto Corsa.			",43,3,16,1,2,0,0

												The 2'nd best racing game. And for £2-3.00 for the game, (And most add-ons!) Its a bargin! graphics isn't good, but the cost for the game is amazing! so get this game! the most expencive add-on is £9.00! And the bundle (£25.00) For 25 add-ons is ridiculus! So get anything for this game! or £25.00 for 25 Add-ons and the game! So i recomend the bundle if you are a Pro. if your new to the game, Then get the slowest car pack, then work up to the GT packs. there are cars such as BMW, Audi, Seat, Mercs, aston Martin, And much more! So this all in all is 10/10 easy! my most favourite racing game so far! 12/12/2015			",6,1,14,0,12,0,0

												It's fun and really cheap. You can get all the addons for pennies in a sale, and if you do, the amount of content is huge. The graphics are what they are, but that isn't really relevant in a sim. Some car interiors and some tracks seem to look a lot better than others.The physics is the most important thing, and it's a bit weird, a bit different. It seems like it's a step towards Forza and Gran Turismo from the most realistic PC sims. This slight wonkiness prevents this game being a perfect ten, and the best sim ever, but it's still good. Too bad it has it's issues in the most important part of a sim, the physics.(And, to be clear, by physics I mean the full driving experience with maximum realism, and how the physics model feels in my hands, not the actual raw math running underneath. I have no idea how this physics engine comapares to other games in complexity, accuracy, level of detail, etc.)			",99,15,19,15,12,0,33

												Started race, reached corner, spun out, sat spinning for 30 seconds  but managed to recalim my first place spot by cutting cornerrs and ramming other cars onto the grass . . . I then got disquallified. If car racing in real life was as exciting as when i race in games then i would probably watch it. In any case I was hoping for something a little less Toca 3/Gran Turismo and a little more grid, this game would be alright with a steering wheel but on pc its just boredom, completely reminded me of one of the racing games id play at an arcard which is great because they are fun there but on pc i find them boring, if your into the more serious/realistic car games normally found at arcades by all means give this a go but otherwise i wouldnt recommend it sorry.

												Absolutely dreadful.The opening cutscene had me so psyched; for being an older racing sim, it looked fantastic. The menus were a nightmare to navigate through but I was almost anticipating that knowing how simulators are typically presented. I began my first race and was immediately unimpressed visually, the interior of the car looks pretty dreadful, but again this is an older game so that's not unexpected. What immediately ended my play time was this bizarre graphical glitch I experienced after about 2 and 1/2 laps. Imagine the screen was split horizontally at multiple uneven locations, dividing the screen into roughly 14 or 15 long rectangles of rendering. Now each of these are vibrating in opposite directions constantly, causing almost instantaneous nausea.I hope I never see a game run like that ever again.			",296,131,12,29,48,4,47

												I bought Race 07 and all the DLC of it.I downloaded and run the app .Terms of agreement comes.I agreed it and the game don't run...I opened Race 07 while I have my Steam app opened so I can tell I am currently playing this game or not.When I opened Race 07 steam app shows that I'm in game - Race 07 but after 5 second or so,it shows that I'm not in the game.I'm currently using Windows 8 and meet all the system requirement for this game except for Windows version.Any Windows 8 user playing this game?And I also visited SimBin studio website but only Main Page appears and other sub pages (Contact,games,blog etc.) dont work there.I guess SimBin studio developers no longer supports any of their games.So I need help and replies from other Race 07 users and Windows 8 users to solve or conclude this problem of mine.Sorry for spoiling reputation of this game but I can only give not recommend to this game because it might happen to other Steam users who have not bought this game.

												I don’t understand it.Racing games are so much fun on my Xbox360. Honestly Forza is all I play on my Xbox. Period.So a racing game on the PC should be even better right? Wrong…I have an Xbox360 remote for my PC, but its still completely useless in this game.Allow me to explain what I’m getting at.You fire up your Xbox. Start Forza. And you pick a car and race. Its simple, you have your assists you can check on or off, you don’t have tons and tons and tons of little nitpicky options to chose from, and everybody you ever play with has the exact same controller as you. The same two stick, two trigger setup.Everybody is on even ground. And the physics in Forza are fluid, and while not entirely realistic, just FEEL right. You learn how to drift, how hard to apply the brakes, it starts to feel natural. And you know you lost because you weren’t as fast as the other guy, not because he had a better control setup, or ticked off a setting I wasn’t aware off…Now take Race007. You fire it up, pick a car, and your plumped onto a track. The engines shut off. Ok that’s neat, but how do I start it?  Duck into the settings and assign a key…  Ok great the motors started here we… ugh I stalled it, better assign a clutch button on my controller… Ok here we go, turn right to exit the pits… oh my god is that what it feels like steering in this game!? Your wheels will turn in slowly, but as soon as you centre the stick your wheels snap back to centre instantly. It feels horrible! There must be a setting to fix it… no… ugh… ok I’ll just have to deal with it. Try a race. The AI kick my ♥♥♥, executing each corner perfectly. While I’m flailing around the course, struggling just to take a turn without messing up… Why not try multiplayer? Sure why not. They should make the same mistakes as me. Nope. They all have $200 wheels and pedals. They can turn with ease and I’m left in the pits… assigning keys I wont remember because the settings changed because this server has different rules… SCREW THIS… I’m going back to Forza…See the dilemma? No? Hey its your cash. Knock yourself out…			",20,1,5,1,14,0,8

												When you start (I have no idea if you unlock more), there are four cars to choose from. The BMW  handles like a brick, the other two I tried spin out at the slightest twitch from sitting still (even with all the assisted crap on), and the fourth I didn't try because I didn't want to sit through another loading screen to be met with the same results.Deciding that I should probably work my way through a championship in order to unlock more content, I headed over to the screen and found that the championships available were ones you create yourself.I must admit that there are a nice selection of tracks, and that I did eventually manage to have some fun when I got into racing. I still, however, don't quite understand how that part works. I set it to five laps but ended up doing limitless amounts to a time limit of what I think was 20 minutes. The aim seemed to be to set the fastest lap time in the alloted time limit, but it also kept reminding me how far behind me the driver in second place was, making me uncertain of the actual goal. And although it seemed under the dialometer that I should visit pit stops at strategic intervals, when I did so I couldn't find any real way to repair my car (although I may not have looked long enough) and when setting off again, the first lap from the pits didn't seem to count towards a time. And also the guy in second place closed our gap by a lap. That was a little terrifying.Anyway, if you got this game for free, give it a shot because you might get some fun out of it. Despite what it says it actually does have 360 controller support. Other than that, don't spend money on this game. You'll regret it.In the meantime, I may come back to this and see if I can make better sense out of it. Maybe that's the key to enjoying this game.			",336,70,35,48,31,5,29

												kinda outdated no? The game engine is probably not from the best, rFactor is better contender mod wise and has better engine than this and other simbin games. Rfactor 2 seems more interesting, then there's the NetKar PRO (outdated now), and the coming Assetto Corsa (from makers of NKP). These following games I've mentioned are all superior to this, and are better places to spend time in.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You know what this is? It's a game. I mention that only because the creators seem to think they have actually built a magical device that is a REAL racing experience. But it's not. It is a program on a computer, and frankly not a very good one either. The problem with so many of these ""racing sims"" is that the people playing them and the people making them will not acknowledge the fact that these are games, built for entertainment value. The view of the world from inside a car is a whole hell of a lot different from one sitting in front of a computer screen. The same rules don't apply. For instance, no matter how good a setup you may have you will never actually be able to feel the car tires start to lose grip. This is a very, very important part of driving that you cannot replicate. But let's be honest here; 99.9% of the people who play games don't have a wheel and pedals and a racing chair - it's just too expensive. Most people will be playing these games with controlers, and will only have a few hours at a time to dedicate to playing. It takes years to learn how to be a real race car driver, and frankly if the people playing these games could be racing car drivers they wouldn't be playing a frankly appaling port of their job. This is a game, but because the makers of this game refuse to admit that it is a game, it's not very good. Unless you are a harcore racing game fanatic, you will hate this game. if you are a hardcore racing game fanatic you will be playing something much better, like Project Cars. This is a game with no real dempographic, and it really shows. Lot's of technical detail, very little enjoyment. I paid $2 for a bundle of seven racing games and I guess this is a classic example of caveat emptor. I got what I paid for.			",157,23,30,29,14,1,22

Sounds are horrible. It sounded like I was driving with a flat tire the whole timeTurned settings to where there was NO damage and yet car would take damage.I like the older graphics and cars, is why I purchased it.

												What Half-Life is to first person shooters I believe Race07 is to racers. It's a mild, simple racing simulator that's not too hard and not too easy. It doesn't bank on ridiculous features to entertain, and it has no codemasters style permanent color scheme. It's not the most user friendly(menus, settings, and pitstops), and does take awhile to get used to(handling and all). But racing with a wheel, for those that enjoy racing, is engaging enough to play race after race of. AI can be challenging when you're on 95% difficulty, however they are hopeless at overtaking and will unintentionally ram you if you slow down. Singleplayer has a good range of options, multiplayer is hit and miss.			",328,38,37,15,49,2,50

												If you like driving games, then get this. The game and its DLC sets are great value now. I play via keyboard, and its main cars work fine via that. Some of the more complex cars in DLC may need a wheel or controller to work well, but don't let that stop you. The graphics are good enough, because its the cars handling and the gameplay that really matter. The bulk of the cars can be changed to handle how you like, and frankly I've played a lot of PC car games where the handling is rubbish. In this game the cars handling, the physics, and the game play are at another level. You'll find that practice is required, and playing online against good drivers is an eye opener for sure. Its a fabulous game - at this price? A steal.			",105,4,25,3,23,1,39

												If you are into racing simulation games, boy do I have a game for you. Yes, Race07 is getting quite old now, but hey, it's racing sim, so we don't really need next-gen graphics. Besides, old game means that it should run just fine on older machines.The really cool thing though is the ability to steer with mouse. This means you don't need a steering wheel to be fast.The only downside is that community is slowly dying. There are still plenty of servers to race with friends and other people, but the most popular ones are just Monza 24/7. I really wish more racers would play other servers with more interesting tracks.			",41,0,10,2,5,0,4

												For me this was, is and will forever be the best racing game ever. A massive selection of cars and to top it off you are allowed to do some under the hood work as well. So you are your own driver and mechanic. Great tracks, in fact the best tracks in racing games history and various rule sets for each of them. Multiplayer is fun and the community is great with everyone playing in they`re favourite leagues and sometimes diving in others just for a new experience. And this is what each race in this game is: an experience. This feels like the real deal and everyone should give it a try.			",198,24,7,35,7,2,34

												Race 07 is a great racing simulator. I would call myself an average racing fanatic and I have to say that the gameplay is hard , but realistic. You get the controls used after a couple of races and then you can try to win a race online/offline! Race 07 has a lot of DLC which are really good. I recommend the GTR EVOLUTION downloadable content for RACE 07. And to be fair, a game for 3 bucks? what can go possibly wrong?			",43,4,5,4,16,0,5

For any actual WTCC fans out there I would recommend purchacing the 2010 season for another $4, then downloading the excelent 2012-2013 seasons mod. A full 6 seasons worth of WTCC drivers and cars will be available (87, 06 and 07 are included). Plus Formula 3000, Caterhams, and a few more that come with the game. Graphics don't look the best, and gameplay is heavy on the sim side, but for the price you can't ask for much more.			",37,4,17,4,12,1,3

												I love my racing games a bit more realistic than Gran Turismo, but not overly so like iRacing and such. This game really makes me able to draw upon that middle ground of quite a bit of realism yet not too hardcore. The controls are perfect, although I wish I had a steering wheel (controller for now) and the additional content is great. Only thing I'd love is a US track pack, since I have fond memories of those tracks. And what do you know? They're just as easy to get via mods and free addons and whatnot. This stuff is excellent.TL;DR get this if you're into medium hardcore racing and don't mind older graphics.			",310,52,25,39,55,1,67

The game covers thanks to modders nearly every well known circuit; F1 from the late 80s - present; DTM, supercars - and BTCC. If you ever had any enjoyment from Toca Touring cars and have been pining for Codies to get their act together and stop making drift games... Get this, get AndersFC's incredible BTCC mod - 96 - 2003. Outstanding. Damage model nothing close to DirT / Grid's, but it's a cracking game nevertheless.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is great a good sim all around. The base game is very enjoyable a nice number of cars and tracks. And the DLC there is free but the paid is very cheap so that's a plus. The AI can be set to different levels of difficulty, so the game is for new and experienced racers. The cars are great the small Formula BMW the bigger Formula 3000 and the DLC Formula RaceRoom, also there is a mini which is very fun, the caterham csr and the radical sr are 2 very challenging cars which can be a lot of fun if you know how to drive them. And the WTCC cars are very enjoyable the 2006/2007 will give you great moments, in some corners you could be sideways going full throttle and the '87 cars are very interesting. The physics are good and visually the game for it's age is great.			",15,0,14,0,1,0,0

												Simbin made some of the best PC road racing games ever in my opinion. It is not the easiest game to learn, but it is very satisfying when you run a good race.Races can be set to either time or laps. Select the class you would like to races, and even download mods or DLC to add even more classes of cars and tracks. Now this game does not have as many mods available as GTR2, but there is still plenty out there to add to your Race 07 experience as well as three DLC packs and a free add track on which is included with this purchase. I race with a mircosoft 360 wireless controler on my PC, and it is still a blast. Have a wheel and it gets even better.You can adjust the AI skill to suit your ability, and have an enjoyable race, and don't forget that there are open wheel cars in this game which GTR2 does not include without a mod.The price is very reasonable, and most computer can run this pretty well.If you like racing games, do not be afraid to give this game a try. You will be doing yourself a diservice.(Note: My hours played is not a true record, since I owned the game on disc when it came out, and I gifted it to the boys and girls club, and I rebought it on Steam when I started to miss my racing games.)

												old but still very fun. the large number of mods out o the internet is amazing and will keep things feeling fresh. if i was to gauge the simulation of Race 07 I think it would be, (better then Gran Turismo but falling behide IRacing) I think the big draw for me was that its still holds a great deal of simulation without the need for a monthly fee  like IRacing.be mindful that this is a simulator and trying to play without a wheel/gamepad is going to be very hard. keyboard/mouse will only lead to frustration.the only big downside to this game are the players themselves. don't even bother trying to jump in a room as you will be kicked for no reason other then your new. so go into race 07 thinking mainly of offline play.

												Do I reccomend this game?Hell yeah! As a long time fan of rFactor, I was intrigued by this game, especially given it's amazing price of £0.47 in the steam christmas sale, this was basically a free game for me, as all the money I used to buy it came from TF2 items and trading cards!The game itself is an accurate and in depth simulation. It has almost all the options of rFactor, and some extras. The graphics are also nicer than rFactor, however, this is to be expected, given that it is a newer game. All the different game modes and cars that are avaliable feel smooth, and drive very well. The game even works well with a pad, although, wheels are obviously the better choice. The only problem I really have with this game is it's multiplayer communtiy, they treat you like s***, if you are new to the game, however, if you play some singleplayer for a few hours beforehand (like I am now doing) then you should be good. This is, however, something to be wary of.So, in conclusion, the singleplayer on this game is simply fantastic, featuring great cars, which all feel well programmed and very nice to drive, good graphics (at least, for 2007) and great gameplay. The multiplayer is also well designed, however, some players could be a little less harsh, because, not everyone has 200+ hours on the game.Overall, I would reccomend this game. Partictularly when it is on sale.Well worth it!			",84,5,4,10,5,0,11

												If you are looking for hardcore racing sim this is it. Physic is great and it should work with the specialized controller easily.However, be warned. This is the HARDCORE sim after all, there are rules and yellow flag and yadda-yadda. In fact, it was so detailed, I got quite tired of playing even on custom short race, there are too many thing to be just pickup-and-play.There isn't a car custamization either. This is solely focuses on racing.In essence, this isn't other kind of Gran Turismo or Forza. This is very detailed racing sim. For some people, it might be a better option to just grab the Grid. Again, if you are into real-world racing sim, this is the best option.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My favorite PC racing game/sim. The collection of tracks is fantastic and the racing action is some of the best out there. Level of control is great, adjusting control sensitivity is easy and you can get it exactly where you want it. Difficulty levels are fantastic as the % slider makes it so you can fight on exactly your level. So many racing games have easy, medium hard. In RACE07 if the AI is just slightly too challenging/easy you can make it anywhere from 1% to 100% easier or harder so you can find the precise difficulty you are looking for.The game does has a few downsides but these do not stop it from being an excellent racer. The graphics are a bit dated (but certainly not bad) by modern standards, the car selection is a bit limited and for some reason spa francorchamps isnt in the game. The car selection is something that can be fixed by acquiring one of several DLC packs. A must have product for any serious racing fan			",180,67,18,46,37,1,47

												If you are looking for hardcore racing sim this is it. Physic is great and it should work with the specialized controller easily.However, be warned. This is the HARDCORE sim after all, there are rules and yellow flag and yadda-yadda. In fact, it was so detailed, I got quite tired of playing even on custom short race, there are too many thing to be just pickup-and-play.There isn't a car custamization either. This is solely focuses on racing.In essence, this isn't other kind of Gran Turismo or Forza. This is very detailed racing sim. For some people, it might be a better option to just grab the Grid. Again, if you are into real-world racing sim, this is the best option.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simbin made some of the best PC road racing games ever in my opinion. It is not the easiest game to learn, but it is very satisfying when you run a good race.Races can be set to either time or laps. Select the class you would like to races, and even download mods or DLC to add even more classes of cars and tracks. Now this game does not have as many mods available as GTR2, but there is still plenty out there to add to your Race 07 experience as well as three DLC packs and a free add track on which is included with this purchase. I race with a mircosoft 360 wireless controler on my PC, and it is still a blast. Have a wheel and it gets even better.You can adjust the AI skill to suit your ability, and have an enjoyable race, and don't forget that there are open wheel cars in this game which GTR2 does not include without a mod.The price is very reasonable, and most computer can run this pretty well.If you like racing games, do not be afraid to give this game a try. You will be doing yourself a diservice.(Note: My hours played is not a true record, since I owned the game on disc when it came out, and I gifted it to the boys and girls club, and I rebought it on Steam when I started to miss my racing games.)

												Do I reccomend this game?Hell yeah! As a long time fan of rFactor, I was intrigued by this game, especially given it's amazing price of £0.47 in the steam christmas sale, this was basically a free game for me, as all the money I used to buy it came from TF2 items and trading cards!The game itself is an accurate and in depth simulation. It has almost all the options of rFactor, and some extras. The graphics are also nicer than rFactor, however, this is to be expected, given that it is a newer game. All the different game modes and cars that are avaliable feel smooth, and drive very well. The game even works well with a pad, although, wheels are obviously the better choice. The only problem I really have with this game is it's multiplayer communtiy, they treat you like s***, if you are new to the game, however, if you play some singleplayer for a few hours beforehand (like I am now doing) then you should be good. This is, however, something to be wary of.So, in conclusion, the singleplayer on this game is simply fantastic, featuring great cars, which all feel well programmed and very nice to drive, good graphics (at least, for 2007) and great gameplay. The multiplayer is also well designed, however, some players could be a little less harsh, because, not everyone has 200+ hours on the game.Overall, I would reccomend this game. Partictularly when it is on sale.Well worth it!			",84,5,4,10,5,0,11

												One of greatest touring car race simulations.Pitstop strategies can be used to great effect in longer races and when race regulations demand to have a pitstop during race (STCC rules). Plenty of setup choices to tune pace for your driving style and durability of tires etc.Car physics are good and realistic, engine and tire modeling are properly done.Visually it's starting to show the age and some controller settings are limited and awkward by today's standards.Also you may need to edit some configuration files manually to get it use your VRAM properly and so on.It's still a good simulation of touring car racing with some open-wheel racers as well.If only there was a sequel or update coming.

												If you are into racing simulation games, boy do I have a game for you. Yes, Race07 is getting quite old now, but hey, it's racing sim, so we don't really need next-gen graphics. Besides, old game means that it should run just fine on older machines.The really cool thing though is the ability to steer with mouse. This means you don't need a steering wheel to be fast.The only downside is that community is slowly dying. There are still plenty of servers to race with friends and other people, but the most popular ones are just Monza 24/7. I really wish more racers would play other servers with more interesting tracks.			",41,0,10,2,5,0,4

												If you like driving games, then get this. The game and its DLC sets are great value now. I play via keyboard, and its main cars work fine via that. Some of the more complex cars in DLC may need a wheel or controller to work well, but don't let that stop you. The graphics are good enough, because its the cars handling and the gameplay that really matter. The bulk of the cars can be changed to handle how you like, and frankly I've played a lot of PC car games where the handling is rubbish. In this game the cars handling, the physics, and the game play are at another level. You'll find that practice is required, and playing online against good drivers is an eye opener for sure. Its a fabulous game - at this price? A steal.			",105,4,25,3,23,1,39

												I've spent hundreds of hours racing in the Race07 series of titles. The WTCC (World Touring Car Championship) series here along with the BTCC (British Touring Car Championship) mods are great short duration races if you run them like they actually would race. Top that off with the STCC (Scandanavian Touring Car Championship) series add-ons and you get races on very tight and tricky tracks of the north. No there is no long duration races possibble here as in other SimBin titles but what you do get are races that are of a shorter duration but full of fun to race. Don't just sit there get it and try it out!!!			",17,2,17,1,8,0,3

												If you're not a regular fan of sim racing games Race 07 will get you hooked. When you purchase Race Injection you get plently of expansion packs along with Race 07 and I have to say it exceeded my expectations. With many cars and tracks to choose from and endless race variations, you will most likely be glued to your seat for hours, and I haven't even got to the gameplay yet. SimBin has really created a top-of-the-line physics engine and I'm not kidding. You have to play it to believe it. Although this game is infact enjoyable when you play with a keyboard I would highly recommend a steering wheel and pedals, as this significantly enhances the experience. Overall Race 07 gets a rating of 9/10 from me. The only factor not giving it a perfect score is the multiplayer which isn't always as enjoyable and challenging as lets say competing against computer opponents.			",64,3,17,7,4,0,4

												First things first: This game is perfectly playable - and vastly enjoyable - with a gamepad. There. I said it.I'm not saying that it is the BEST way to get the MOST out of the game but the reviews I'm seeing posted that state the game is only playable with a steering wheel are misleading at best. The only thing that will ruin this great game is a lack of patience. And it does require patience! If I flick the thumbstick too much the car spins; if I squeeze the trigger too much while trying to turn the car spins; one wheel off the track and on the grass? Guess what? The car spins!However, after a couple of hours focussing on one car (Mini Cooper) on one track (Brands Hatch) I eventually became accustomed to the physics of the game and began to put in some pretty decent lap times. Then, emboldened, I even started removing some of the driving assists. After more hours I became very comfortable and was putting in consistently quick laps. Now I've just got to learn how to handle the rest of the cars. And how to race round the rest of the tracks. And I can't wait.If you have patience and either a gaming wheel or a gamepad, buy this game - it's all of £2.49! It is so much more rewarding than any other racing game I have played. Also, there is a modding community that is still very active and has done a great job professionally recreating pretty much every circuit ever raced on. So if you fancy taking a Touring Car or a Formula 3000 car for a spin (literally in my case!) around Snetterton, Aintree, Sepang or even the Top Gear test track then this is the game for you.

												great racing game.   Graphics are dated but adequate.  Many many many Mods available.  Some of the BEST Door to door bumper to bumper racing in traffic.  turn up the AI to 100% or better and you have a hard time getting through traffic let alone winning.  I think still one of the best racing games.  Lots of Online racing Leagues available.  Downside is no Force Feedback.			",33,0,14,0,3,0,0

												Race 07 is a great racing simulator. I would call myself an average racing fanatic and I have to say that the gameplay is hard , but realistic. You get the controls used after a couple of races and then you can try to win a race online/offline! Race 07 has a lot of DLC which are really good. I recommend the GTR EVOLUTION downloadable content for RACE 07. And to be fair, a game for 3 bucks? what can go possibly wrong?			",43,4,5,4,16,0,5

												I don't have much to add to these reviews except this:If you're thinking about getting into racing games but don't have a wheel, don't let anyone tell you that you can't play Race 07 and its kin (GTL, GTR2, etc) with a keyboard.  Hooey!  I've only been playing racing games since late '07, but I have a bunch of the SimBin games as well as some NFS games and Codemasters games.  Some are more keyboard-friendly than others, but all are amenable to keyboard play.Get a wheel and pedals if you have room for it and don't mind spending the money, but don't worry about having only a keyboard if that's your situation.  I tried a game pad early on, but gave it up right away as just too strange (way too old to have been raised with one in my hands).Spend a little time to come up with your own key mapping profile and practice, practice, practice.Don't worry, have fun.Frank			",3,0,11,0,3,0,0

												Do I reccomend this game?Hell yeah! As a long time fan of rFactor, I was intrigued by this game, especially given it's amazing price of £0.47 in the steam christmas sale, this was basically a free game for me, as all the money I used to buy it came from TF2 items and trading cards!The game itself is an accurate and in depth simulation. It has almost all the options of rFactor, and some extras. The graphics are also nicer than rFactor, however, this is to be expected, given that it is a newer game. All the different game modes and cars that are avaliable feel smooth, and drive very well. The game even works well with a pad, although, wheels are obviously the better choice. The only problem I really have with this game is it's multiplayer communtiy, they treat you like s***, if you are new to the game, however, if you play some singleplayer for a few hours beforehand (like I am now doing) then you should be good. This is, however, something to be wary of.So, in conclusion, the singleplayer on this game is simply fantastic, featuring great cars, which all feel well programmed and very nice to drive, good graphics (at least, for 2007) and great gameplay. The multiplayer is also well designed, however, some players could be a little less harsh, because, not everyone has 200+ hours on the game.Overall, I would reccomend this game. Partictularly when it is on sale.Well worth it!			",84,5,4,10,5,0,11

												Still haven't really understood what Race07 offered more than GT2. All the expansions seem to me that could be imported to gtr2 as well , unless its just a pricing model thing.Anyways , I cannot really find obvious differences between the titles except for the content, and driving them is an enjoyable experience for me. I find the menus quite annoying . The online community is quite alive , but its popularity starts to degrade as newer titles come up and. More leagues are organized in AC , rFactor 2 , and the still alive rFactor.Anyways , Simbin has a tradition in making racing titles and they cannot literally disappoint you concerning the fun you can have , instead they have set high standards so that people always expect more. And it seems that with their next gem sim R3E , they will hit the sweet spot in the future.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If your a fan of fast pace racing with great tracks then race07 is a game you will enjoy and i was surprised at the system requirements this needed to run as i thought i would struggle to run the game using my computer but my old budget gaming pc didn't struggle at all which is a first lol.I havn't spent much time playing the online section of it yet but the couple of races i did play seemed to be enjoyable and didn't find any connection issues with the other players such as people lagging round the track.

												First things first: This game is perfectly playable - and vastly enjoyable - with a gamepad. There. I said it.I'm not saying that it is the BEST way to get the MOST out of the game but the reviews I'm seeing posted that state the game is only playable with a steering wheel are misleading at best. The only thing that will ruin this great game is a lack of patience. And it does require patience! If I flick the thumbstick too much the car spins; if I squeeze the trigger too much while trying to turn the car spins; one wheel off the track and on the grass? Guess what? The car spins!However, after a couple of hours focussing on one car (Mini Cooper) on one track (Brands Hatch) I eventually became accustomed to the physics of the game and began to put in some pretty decent lap times. Then, emboldened, I even started removing some of the driving assists. After more hours I became very comfortable and was putting in consistently quick laps. Now I've just got to learn how to handle the rest of the cars. And how to race round the rest of the tracks. And I can't wait.If you have patience and either a gaming wheel or a gamepad, buy this game - it's all of £2.49! It is so much more rewarding than any other racing game I have played. Also, there is a modding community that is still very active and has done a great job professionally recreating pretty much every circuit ever raced on. So if you fancy taking a Touring Car or a Formula 3000 car for a spin (literally in my case!) around Snetterton, Aintree, Sepang or even the Top Gear test track then this is the game for you.

												I read the reviews and purchased RACE 07 low on funds and looking for something different from my other games. Glad I did! This game is now one of my favorites. Not having a wheel and only using a mouse and keyboard, I was a bit concerned if it would be all that playable. Rest assure it's not only playable, but downright fun! If you use the keyboard and mouse, by editing the settings and keeping most of the auto settings on, you can for the most part play with just a mouse alone, You probably couldn't keep up with the big boys and gals online though, also after a couple hours of straight racing my hand tends to cramp up due to tightnig my grip to steer.The replay viewer and camera controls are another plus. You can go back and watch where you messed up or find out what exactly caused that multi-car pile up. Yes, the graphics are a bit dated, but when your doing 110+ mph and coming up on a hairpin curve, with bumper to bumper cars, you really should be paying more attention to your driving and not enjoying the scenery, This ain't a Sunday drive game! Still, the graphics are better than expected and my laptop running Windows 10 an intel core i3-4030U CPU, 6GB RAM, with built in Intel 4400 HD Graphics has no problem running this game smoothly with everything set to max. Your mileage may vary depending on make and model, so I can't say how good your performance will be.Haven't tried the multiplayer due to a poor internet connection, so being able to play offline is just about a must and RACE 07 allows you to do just that.More free mods, car skins and tracks can be found online by doing a search, but read the descriptions and install instructions carefully, with so much DLC addon content available for 07, some downloads require you to have more than just the base game.I see a wheel and more of the DLC content being added in the near future, best purchse value for the fun in a long time!Thanks ",24,2,3,2,18,0,4

												I've spent hundreds of hours racing in the Race07 series of titles. The WTCC (World Touring Car Championship) series here along with the BTCC (British Touring Car Championship) mods are great short duration races if you run them like they actually would race. Top that off with the STCC (Scandanavian Touring Car Championship) series add-ons and you get races on very tight and tricky tracks of the north. No there is no long duration races possibble here as in other SimBin titles but what you do get are races that are of a shorter duration but full of fun to race. Don't just sit there get it and try it out!!!			",17,2,17,1,8,0,3
