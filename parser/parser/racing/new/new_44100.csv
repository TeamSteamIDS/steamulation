												I thoroughly recommend this game. If you are an old-schooler and remember Super Cars (II or III) on Amiga 500 or Micro Machines to a lesser degree, then this is very similar.It's a very racey shootey 2D-er, with a great challenge and fantastic soundtrack, (the kind of beat beat boom boom boom, I usually only like in video games). If you can pick it up cheap, then do!You probably won’t give it 100 hours, but if you give it 10 or 20 they will not be boring.I give it 10 thumbs up (wait, what?). ",125,17,14,3,15,2,21

												The game has a few bugs and inconveniences:- Gamepad doesn't really work. With it plugged in I couldn't race. It gets stuck on the loading screen just before a race.- Windowed mode isn't recommended. The gameplay will be extremely choppy. Fullscreen is basically required for smooth play.- You can't do much else if you're playing this game. If you run any other software at the same time that uses your CPU reasonably, this game'll be choppy. It seems a tad poorly coded for such a simple looking game.That aside, for just under 1 euro (in a sale) you have an amusing little racing game. You have a choice out of various tracks, difficulty, and what type of race you want. You can do a normal race, elimination, survival, or time trial. Multiplayer's possible as well, though I haven't tried it yet. You can also decide which vehicle you want to race in, each have their own pros and cons.The screenshots of this game pretty much says it all about what the game looks like. You get to be able to shoot at your opponents, after you've driven over those red square thingies. That is the weapon box. The other symbols have various effects like boost, or reducing your speed. You can customize tracks as well, including changing the colors.I can recommend this game if you see it for cheap in a sale and you happen to like top-down racing games.. It's just that, a little racing game, worth a buck at most.			",987,514,42,197,143,15,253

												This is a really old game! It's a F-Zero type racer (where your cars can blow up if you take too much damage, and you can heal by running over special tracks), with some Mario Kart items and Geometry Wars graphics. The soundtrack is very good if you're into electronica, and each racecar has different properties that can work with different playstyles or different racetracks. For achievement hunters who happen to have this in their library already, it should provide about 10 hours of pleasant frustration. Otherwise, I don't really recommend it.Firstly, this game has an outrageous number of technical problems. Sometimes when you try to run it, it doesn't initialize and you have to task-kill it before trying again. Sometimes it runs, but if something's hogging processor cycles, the framerate lag will snowball out of control until the game becomes completely unplayable. And the online multiplayer has long since been disabled, you can't host a server anymore. LAN play still works, however.If you actually get the game to run, you might find that it's a very decent racer. There are some real magical moments of exhilaration when you're absolutely shredding the track and trying to maintain your first place lead. Unfortunately, the magic is killed by the game's terrible selection of items and the CPU players who will use them on you. See, when you get hit with an item, you lose the ability to steer your vehicle for about five seconds. It's just about as annoying as it might sound. If you're about to take a sharp turn and a CPU player comes up from behind and blasts you with a seeking missile... sorry! Now you're careening off the track and way in last place, and there was nothing you could really do to prevent it. Luck-based Mario Kart hell.The items are not only unfun to get hit with, they're unfun to wield, and they require high precision if you want to do anything with them -- precision that the CPU players have, but not you. While I never caught a CPU blatantly cheating, they have an infuriatingly accurate aiming algorithm that leads their shot to exactly where you'll be when the shot will hit. It's very impressive and must use some kind of trigonometry calculation, but it will make you pull your hair out. They also have an uncanny ability to get a seeking missile or a tractor beam when they're in close second. Naturally, the shield item is the best item in the game, and it's usually the case that the player(s) who get the shield within the first five seconds of the race will be able to get a huge lead that they'll keep for the remainder of the race.The weapon chaos wouldn't be so bad if the game didn't expect you to come in first place every single race if you want to get the final achievement. Luckily, you get infinite retries if you abuse the restarting feature, and you will absolutely need to abuse it if you want to survive the random chaos in the first ten seconds of every race.Overall, it's a perfect demonstration of why an F-Zero racer shouldn't have Mario Kart items. It's one of those games that's a complete blast when you're winning, but utter bull when bad luck screws everything up. Give it another chance if you already own it, but otherwise avoid.

												Are you a fan of retro racing games like Wipeout or F-Zero? Are you a fan of Geometry Wars? If so, buy this game. It's a brilliant little top-down kart-style racer with Geometry Wars-esque ships and graphics and Wipeout-esque weapons. Such a simple concept, and pulled off really well.

												If Super Laser Racer were a pair of sneakers, mine would be worn-out, haggard shreds of leather, and I've enjoyed wearing them since they were bright, shiny, and sitting in a box with crumpled up packing paper. SLC invites you to defeat all of it. It offers enough variety in tracks and levels of difficulty that it was fun to revisit until I'd completed everything. The game is simple and straight-forward. The controls are relatively decent and you'll never have a tough time figuring out what your objective is (in case you're wondering: WIN THE RACE ;-).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It feels like this game isn't finished but it has all the core fundamentals which are required. It has a fairly nice variety of weapons and the track layouts are fun to play. There's not really any point in playing multiplayer without the ""equal ships"" setting because you aren't allowed to choose your ship, so you will probably be at a disadvantage to others otherwise.For £1 I think this was a good purchase for a quick bit of fun, but I think if they polished it up and added some features which you would expect, like background music in multiplayer, a better multiplayer chat system, the ability to change server settings without starting a new server, an end-game timer for slower players, the ability to do something rather than stare at the leaderboard until the next game, etc., then it would be worth its normal £3.

												Simple game, but well made. The weapons are well implemented standards, and the racing has more to it than just get the weapons, stay ahead. Each racer has it's own stats, affecting top speed, acceleration, durability, and most interestingly, turning. It makes for an interesting set up, and execution. The best part is that the randomness of the other racers keeps the matches from becoming predictable. Simple, but entertaining, overall.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a crock this is.Every vehicle handles pretty much the same as the others, aside from very minute differences, the power-ups are a joke, and the difficulty is completely artificial.+Soundtrack is okay, I guess.+The style is nice. Lasers are pretty cool.+Top down racer.-Controller support is a joke. You can't pause the race with anything but the escape key. No modern controller support. (A big ""screw you"" to ExBawks and PS users.)-Power-ups aren't remotely balanced. You can get hit with a tractor beam off-screen and be slowed and unable to turn for as long as they're behind you. So you could drop from first to last because of one power-p.-The vehicles handle the same, and thus the stat values mean nothing. 20% of what? 80% of what?All in all, glad I got this in a humble bundle for a dollar.

												Super Laser Racer does several things right and one very major thing wrong. Widescreen modes and the Steam Overlay are supported, as are a Steam Achievements. The game features multiplayer, a leaderboard and even an editor in addition to the single player racing mode. The music is appropriate and not annoying and the games graphics are serviceable. However, the glaring problem with Super Laser Racer is the keyboard control scheme, basically the arrow keys and the space bar, which make completing even the simplest of tracks extremely challenging. Fortunately the game does include controller support, which in the case of this game is arguably a requirement.   I would recommend that most players avoid this title, unless of course your primary interest is in designing new tracks.			",1051,328,48,158,114,10,216

I recommend F-Zero and SpeedRunners instead.- Editor lacks zoom, gamepad support, edge scrolling, and correctly defined start area because it won't save your track without one!- Multiplayer service is down, showing only weird HTML.- Unbalanced weapons. Some require exact aim and others instantly affect the nearest player anywhere on the map.- Rocket still plays seeking sound after exploding.- Engines sound slow, and loud while idle.- Collision physics are kinda random.- Border areas deal damage as well as slow you down even more. Super Mario Kart leaves damage to easier, more satisfying weapons.Good:+ Old gamepads are (mostly) supported.+ Lots of vehicles and tracks.			",208,26,6,26,18,2,41
