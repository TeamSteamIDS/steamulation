								Great game, using boost to make perfect drifts is like a dream that becomes true! I really love all the graphics, cars and their parts are very nice looking, and I feel highly involved into the race.I see a lot of potential here and I can't wait to start my career. Shut up and take my money! :D			",67,14,3,5,10,0,8

								This game is awsome !!! Much better than other racing Games !!! But for the future i would like to see:-Parts being unlocked when winning a Race (example: Hyber Speedway with 3 laps and Manual Transmission to win the new bumper)-more Tracks-better Performance-better Handling-more Parts in totalBut exept that its the best Game i ever played since i bought Minecraft and Scrap Mechanic :) ",13,2,2,0,8,1,1

								So firs off I'd like to say im so glad this game is finally out, ive been following development for a while, saying as this is early access I have noticed some things that need some work, but overall the game has a lot of potential! The visuals are stunning and the art style is really cool. as I mentioned in my email this morning, the controls do need a touch of work, (coming from someone playing on a keyboard). I really do love the game and I cant wait to see where it goes!			",15,0,3,0,1,0,1

								Great game! Very pretty considering it's early access state, and they're going to allow you to 3D print your cars which is super neat and a pretty new concept in gaming. Has a lot of promise and i'm excited to see what else they have in store to come. Not super realistic controls but like I said, early access, and i'm sure it'll improve as they develope. Here's a look at it so far
