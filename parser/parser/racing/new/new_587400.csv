												I have wanted a snowmachine game sense SledStorm came out on PlayStation one. This is the best thing to come out sense then for people that want a snow cross game. The game is very arcade and the snowmachines have a generic sound and don't really handle like a real snowmachine but its not bad. It does'int quite have the realism that MX unleashed offered for moto-cross games but It's a good start. Only complaint I have is the price. I fell like $9.99 is a more realistic price for the quailty of game.			",97,8,14,4,31,0,17

												We’re at a mountain top. Wind blows up snow in the air and the the two-cylinder smoke lies as a curtain behind the drivers. All equally tense. Everyone looking in the same direction with the same goal. Hearts pounding, nervousness and an enormous adrenaline onslaught. The drivers tightening their grips on the handlebars with their thumb on the gas. That’s how it’s like on the starting line, now let me tell you about the gameplay. Ready-Set-Go! Off we go and all the tension is wiped away. I’m off to a perfect start by timing it and my controller starts to shake as I push the nitro button for extra speed. My snowmobile shakes from the speed boost as I switch to first person view for better immersion. I’m totally there, taking a crazy route noone’s ever taken, far away from the other racers. I barely miss two trees and bounce slightly on a wicked bush. I manage to release the gas, and I slide sideways past two competitors, to line up perfectly in front of the next gate. Slowly up the hill now, trying to make a stunt with the right stick while driving to reload some nitro, slowly towards the goal on the top… curses … I’m passed, not once but twice, and I’m third in the race. If you’re like me, that’s not OK, you’ll want to stay for a long time in this world of snow and speed - to be the best!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun little indie game, especially with few options in this genre. High jumping, fast adrenaline, arcade racing game. Ski-Doo Challenge on PS3 is the last snowmobile game that I have played. Its has some similarities to the very few jetski games on the market too, just snow rather than water-waves. It is much more arcade (tricks for boosts) than sim, but lots of events and some nicely designed tracks to unlock. The open point-to-point races are a bit bland though. Day-night-weather cycles make it look nice too and the snow is detailed.The important physics and handling can get sloppy resulting in lots of over-steering on the slim tracks and going all over the place, but with some practice and upgraded snowmobiles that have better handling-grip it gets better. I didn't see any controller adjustments for the sensitive steering. Also, you accellerate very fast, so momentum and proper control is not so important unlike with sims. Those are some areas that could improve. $19 when on sale is decent. Will update as I play more...			",313,64,48,19,11,3,23
