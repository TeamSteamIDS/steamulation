												Very beautiful, I wish it would take longer to get to the finish, and great for my 5-year old daughter.  There's not much (quality) VR titles for children so many thanks to the ELIOT team!			",153,105,5,3,31,3,3

												I am going to give this game positive feedback because the developers made a good work. It is fun to play for people from every age.The only negative point is that there is only one race. Maybe something for in the future....			",949,130,62,46,121,22,97

												This ""game"" is rather short, only consisting of one track, no way to rebind keys and not even any high scores. HOWEVER, the quality of the VR experience is amazing and I really enjoy running through the level to try and beat my high score. I use an xbox controller and I don't experience any sickness. I really hope the developer can add online high scores and more content down the road. It is cheap, but it is short. If you have VR and like racing games, why not give it a punt.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
