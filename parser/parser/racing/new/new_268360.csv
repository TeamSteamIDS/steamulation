Early Access Review
								You could say that Krautscape is almost a finished product with how polished everything is, but i hope not, the game will come out of Steam Early Access and launch after a few months of developing, i love the art style/graphics of the game, and the gameplay and it's unique ideas like the track building while you race, this is a great game for the asking pricing, it has local and online support, and a split-screen too, one thing is missing though that i find would make make recommend this game without question, there is no AI/Bots, you could say ""well it doesn't need it, just play with your friends or online in a match"", i could do that but what if i couldn't? i can't have my friends come play with me whenever i please, the online component of the game can be is another solution but it may die off in time, that's why bots are needed in the game and i hope they do add it when the game releases.More info at: http://www.ksalue.com/main/2014/04/game-shock-krautscape/

								It's a fun and simple multiplayer game with a neat art style.My favorite mode so far is ""Ping Pong"". The player in the lead creates the track as they drive. When the time limit is up, the finish line is created and first car there gets a point. Then you race the track you just built in reverse... first car to the previous start gets a point and you keep going to build more race track in that direction. This repeats a few times, so the track gets longer each round. The trick is trying to remember the layout so that you can fly between sections of the track and skip over huge chunks.

								Alright, here's the deal with this game, the game got released, got attention, and slowly faded into a small community, however after a while the dev had to focus his attention on another projects so eventually the population faded into zero, luckily the dev is back! :DAbout the gameThe game is truely fun and competitive, it recently got a big singleplayer update(still no bots, doubt bots will ever PROPERLY happen due to how racing works), the racing + flying physics got updated recently and they need alot of tweaking, IF you get this, get it with friends because that'll be where this game shines, in competitive multiplayer.Let's hope the dev keeps working on the game!

								Played it at my friend's home.  IT'S AWESOME! Unbelieveable how awesome this game is. As first I thought ""ugh, what is this..."" played it for 2 minutes and felt in love with it. The AWESOME point about it - YOU generate the track, your enemies don't know what's coming. I mean, as first you make a track that is straight, suddenly you make a sharp right turn& so does the track generates at the goal a sharp right turn. Your enemies can't react that fast so they fall off the track.. but hey, it's not over yet.. they decide to press SPACE and fly back on the road! It's AWESOME! We just need more players, so guys - buy it, add me & lets play! :)			",143,13,6,10,14,3,17

								[INFORMATION REFLECTS BETA AS OF 4/2/2014]The game is very good and lots of fun when you can find other people to play with, although that's tough at the moment.  Still some glitches where your car will get stuck if you hit a blockade too fast.BACKSPACE key will reset your vehicle.Gliding isn't quite as accurate (in terms of physics) as you would want.  I think they need to spend some time with a glider to understand what will happen when you turn hard left/right.  Other than that, though, I like this title.  Looking forward to keeping an eye on it.			",55,22,1,10,28,4,14

								It needs a ton of work, but is otherwise fun. Very unique game that i recommend and i hope that online mode gets more players. It takes practice and doesn't handle quite like a typical racer. It is a mix of arcade and sim in its current build. The colors are... eh, something else. I really recommend those get changed around.Would like to see the ability to make your own tracks, perhaps some different kart designs down the road or hoverships.			",101,87,17,28,3,0,6

												The concept for this game is great, but the execution is downright awful.  This is a racing game (with flying cars, I might add) where you have no speed indicator and the controls essentially prohibit precision braking, accelerating, and turning, making it extraordinarily difficult to stay on a track that has a lot of tight corners.The track is created by the player currently in first in this racing game.  That player can create sharp or gradual turns, straight track, and occasionally loops or jumps.  I expected the lead player to have some extra controls to cycle through track choices for the next leg, but instead the track is generated based on where the player drives on the course.  If you drive on the far left, you create a sharp left turn.  If you drive slightly left of center, you create a gradual left turn.  This is  pretty much the worst way you could possibly build track, because anyone who has ever played a racing game knows you start sharp turns from the opposite side, so the lead player has no incentive to ever make the track turn because it would cause him to crash into the wall!This horrendous oversight in game mechanics all assumes you could even play a multiplayer game.  I have sat for over 30 minutes on the  “Waiting for Players” screen and only once got a multiplayer game going, but the player dropped out of the race shortly after it began.  This is probably because the stupid controls are unmanageable and the cars are all identical, thus there is no way to catch up when you inevitably fall behind unless the other player also makes a grievous mistake.  There are no power ups, no speed boosts, no anything that could give you an advantage or help even the race.  I’m guessing multiplayer would be a lot more fun than solo, but it seems this game isn’t nearly enjoyable enough to keep enough players interested in joining multiplayer sessions.  Perhaps it might be fun if you and 3 of your closest friends collectively waste $$ on this game, but probably not.The solo levels are also garbage.  The game forces you to earn a medal on a level before the next one opens up.  This means that sooner rather than later you will get stuck and be unable to progress.The Cars-with-wings aspect is kind of cool, but flying slows you down to about half normal speed, so you have no reason to ever fly unless there is a jump in the course.  Also, the car constantly veers in a completely unexpected direction when you attempt to steer while flying, so that sucks too.			",261,95,7,15,27,2,18

												Here's the deal. This is a game designed for multiplayer. Playing online is incredibly fun (particularly ping-pong mode), each game creates a different track with different ways to reach the goal, and it is fast-paced and requires you to plan ahead your course. I'm typically not a fan of racing games, but this one really appeals to me.For such a low price, I definitely recommend this game. It's fun to pick up and play a few races. My only problem is that people are rarely online (not the dev's fault); hopefully this will change with time.			",33,6,1,1,7,0,3

The only real downfall is that it is almost impossible to find peeps playing it online.  BUT, if u get this with friends, WHICH I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU DO, you will have a blast.  The implications of the game mechanics create many ways for the people lagging behind to catch up and/or screw up the front player, but the front player has a lot of freedom while creating whatever track they wish.I LOVE THIS GAME.

												Great art style and core gameplay mechanic is brilliant. While the game does have a singleplayer component the meat and potatoes of this game is the competitive multiplayer, in which you will compete with others to bend and curve the track to reach your objective before anyone else. Unfortunatley you may find it rather difficult to find anyone to play multiplayer with you. The community for this game has become so small since it's initial early access release that it's in your best interest to find one of your friends to play with rather than waiting for randos online. The controls in this game are also very floaty, your ""car"" has a very wide turning radius and the brakes don't really stop you but rather slow you down, the air controls can be a bit finicky at times but are overall solid. If you have a couple of friends to play this with I would definitley recommend picking it up, if not you might want to wait on it.			",45,26,1,4,5,1,12

								...Krautscape's trailer does the job well enough; cherry picks the best bits for others to see. I'll hand it to them; they gave the great impression of a game that promises high speed racing with the allure that, if you fly off the track, you can gracefully fly like a bird and reclaim victory from the jaws of defeat.Lies.Lies and deciet.Starting out the game, I headed to singleplayer; I heard multiplayer was basically non-existant, and I wanted get a grip on the controls, see how the mechanics worked....The controls are GARBAGE. Your car is not a car; it is a block of ice with a motor and it is HORRIBLY unbalanced in the air (one errant twitch, not going perfectly straight? Your straight rise up becomes a tumble).The first few levels try to teach you about how the car controls; turns and junk, have you pass through checkpoints. It'd be great if the car's turning wasn't ABYSMAL. Don't even think about using the brake, either; you just try to stop on a dime, and going fast and trying to make sharp turns with a that block of ice and a brake? You spin (like a record). You spin out, skid, stop. There goes your medal. Reset level.I had the patience to go an hour into the single player levels, and I didn't even get any flying action; it was awful turning with painfully slow acceleration (don't even get me started on boost pads coupled with tight turns; WHOOPS, THERE'S THE ENDLESS ABYSS) and a horribly slow restart back into the game.Super Meat Kart this is not; you have to pause. Hit reset. Go back to the start of the level, wait five seconds to start again, go with your slow start...and inevitably, crash and burn, time and time again.I was stuck on one level, a seemingly simple thing: bunch of boosts up a ramp, platform on the other side. You'd think they'd get THAT right....10 minutes. A sixth of my playtime. Dedicated to slowly accelerating to the boosts up, boosting up, rising...And hitting the tiny grey support platform in front of it, falling back down into the abyss, yet again. For ten minutes.I can finally see why people are skeptical about Early Access. You don't know what you're getting into, especially when a large percent of the reviews for this game are positive....I dove into the abyss, and came out a bitter, angry man.I'll think of giving this game another shot when things aren't awful, but for now, for those reading this that're skeptical?Buy it. See for yourself. And after you're done, give the dev a pat on the back and show him how to do things better.Make something better than...this.			",137,28,1,8,6,2,10

												Krautscape is a racing game in which you build the track as you drive. Also, your car can fly. It's a neat idea, but it's so terrible in practice. The physics are the worst I've ever seen in a racing game. When you're flying your carplane will veer off in the wrong direction for no apparent reason. I can't tell if it's just buggy or if the game is supposed to be simulating wind, and doing a very poor job of it. Even on land the car controls like a giant icecube with a steering wheel attached. The trailer shows the car flying gracefully into the air like a bird, and doing sweet drifts to send the track exactly where they want it to go. None of this ever happens in the game. Attempting to drive around a corner is a horrible experience. And if you fall off the track (you will) you get sent right to the back. Not behind the last racer, right at the start of the track. The track does disappear when you drive over it, but if you're in the air, this doesn't happen. So if you attempt to skip a section of track by flying over it and you mess it up... you're gonna have to do it all again. I should explain how the the track building works. It chooses the next piece based on which part of the track the leader is driving on. If they drive on the left, the track curves to the left. But there's absolutely no reason to do this, it only makes your opponents more likely to overtake you. If you curve the track, you're gonna have to slow down to make the turn without falling off, giving your more reckless opponents a chance to zoom past you. Or you can risk falling off and waiting for your car to slowly respawn. Plus, it's probably just going to put your section of track closer to previous sections, making it easier for other racers to fly over and catch up. If you just drive in a straight line without curving at all, there's nothing the other racers can do to overtake you. There are no items or boosts that might help even things out. All you can do is keep driving and hope they somehow ♥♥♥♥ up. But because the leader never has to fly or make unexpected turns, their chance of ♥♥♥♥ing up is much lower than yours. When someone gets in the lead, they tend to stay in the lead.And then the final nail in the coffin: the multiplayer is dead. I have never seen a multiplayer game this dead. I could only find two people playing it, and they were just repeating the same mode over and over again. And of course there's no map variation to keep things interesting. There's a single player, but no AI racers. All you can do is drive the tracks on your own. Not much fun.I played for less than 2 hours so I could get a refund, but I could tell my opinion wasn't going to change. Great idea let down by terrible execution.			",250,56,3,37,30,2,30

								As it stands, this game is very interesting and very fun. The track generation is just so fun to play with, and it's a blast to see what crazy world willl be generated. And then to just fly across it, finding your own ""secret shortcuts"" is just amazing and fun.Right now, it's better to play with friends than online, as being in early access, you'll only encounter the same players over and over, being stuck against people who constantly win. Worse yet, you often find every other game type is empty while one has the only players playing. This is a fault of early access and should be remidied in the future as the game progresses and gains more players, but it is something to note at this time.Edit: Currently, NOBODY plays this game. Which is sad. It's very hard to find anyone to play with at all.There is no single player, so you'll always be playing online unless you've got a joypad and a friend, so be prepared for that. If you can get past all that, the game is great in this state, and I can see it getting better as the game gets updated as well as gets more players.			",193,37,4,9,15,4,17

												You have two main vehicles: a car, and a car with wings.You drive an abstract vehicle on an abstract track floating on an empty abstract world.However, for a racing game, this game has several flaws:- No HUD for the target times (gold/silver/bronze). The times are only shown AFTER you complete the race. So, there is no way to see if you are doing well or if you should restart the track early. In other words, the game forces the player to waste time.- No HUD for the current speed. I can't know for sure if my strategy is better or worse, nor can I know if I am too fast for the next turn, just because I have no way to measure it. This quickly becomes a blind trial-and-error, wasting your time.- Upon the start of the race, or after hitting the RESTART button after finishing a race, there is a 5-second waiting time until you can move. Again, this is the game forcing you to waste time. Fortunately, if you hit Backspace (or gamepad Y) while racing, you get a ""fast restart"", where there is only a much more reasonable 1-second delay.- You have to beat the Bronze time in order to progress. However, the times are pretty tight, so most (casual?) players won't ever beat those times.- The wings of the car, when retracted, fold up, obscuring some essential portions of the view area.- Although the game can be controlled with an analog input device, the control itself is digital. It doesn't matter if you slightly turn your analog stick (or racing wheel), the car will either go straight or fully turn the wheels.- The settings screen only has the predefined Unity settings. No way to fine-tune the graphics.I want to support indie devs, but I must be honest: I didn't like this game.Overall, my feeling while playing it was: ""Why am I playing this inferior game? I should be playing TrackMania instead.""Sure, TrackMania doesn't have a flying car, but it is a much more enjoyable, much more polished, and a much better experience. Go play TrackMania instead of Krautscape.			",612,229,21,38,55,9,66

								A promising game with some major issues.Krautscape is an online"" fly/race game that tries to get away from the traditional race genre.You play as some folded origami bird and try to complete a map as quick as possible be it driving or flying. Probably a good deal of both. The track is just there..if you think you can take a shortcut, go for it!You might be rewarded for your guess or severely punished.On top of that there is the aspect of 'make your track as you go'. Can't say how interesting that is 'cause I havn't been able to find someone to play online with EVER (and there are lots of people who own/owned this much longer than me who experienced thesame issue..)It's already a beautiful and interesting game but it needs some fixes and even more a decent playerbase.The rest I'll give to you in a quick pro's and cons down below:Pros:- Native support for split screen and LAN- interesting gameplay with decent single player.- beautiful art style- Challenging handling/steering with a real sense of velocity- interesting take on race gamesWhat de dev's need to do is:-Fix the much too often screen freezes. -Give an option to mute or at least adjust the annoying ambient sounds- Make user made maps easier to share and make (and by 'make' I mean in the traditional sense of the word, probably with a track builder like Speed Runners or TrackMania, the current thing just isn't going to work) -NOT GIVE UP ON THIS GAME, promote it! or just cut the online aspect completely..and let it fade into obscurity...

												Got this game in a bundle - Probably would have ignored it, but was looking at the game screen and thought it might be worth a try.  Just played for a little before work and i like it.  The graphics are good, very good for an indie game in a bundle for a good price.  The controls are good, though i preferred the xbox controller to the keyboard.  Audio is good and gameplay gradually builds so you are challenged but not overwhelmingly so.  I just played a few of the flying tracks and found that to be quite fun as well.  This is much better than your average indiegala first tier game, or 2nd tier for that matter.  I can't speak to the replayability or long term play until i spend some more time on it, but it looks promising.  Good Job to the programmers!			",3188,1239,129,330,427,35,504

								The idea for this game is really great! It's like a heavily modified trackmania, but lacks some of the most vital parts for this kind of game to really work out.Ok let's dive in shall we??Is it like trackmania?You bet your sweet ♥♥♥ it is. Well, at least its got all those big windey tracks and sick loops that it has. the driving is more like a copy and paste script that you can easily find on the Unity3D Forums. the turning is for ♥♥♥♥, and the driving is all around arcade-like, so thats no fun. but wait? Isnt this a driving game?YEAH! and thats whats so frustrating. I firmly believe that in order to make an effective driving game, you have to include more than stop, go, and shift. Unfortunately for you, there is barely a brake to even use. Either youre going 120 mph or youre dead stopped and turned around 180 degress. But wait! Theres more!Indeed! Theres a flying aspect to it! Sounds neat, but I havent gotten around to that so I'll keep you posted. Ok so thats neat-o. So like, can you make your own tracks and stuff?""Hell nah, son. I havent been able to find a Copy-paste script on the Unity3D forums yet. But when I do....""I really wouldnt consider this a game, as much as I would a project for your 3d Game Development 101 final. It's something that should have been ported over to Iphone because there are obtainable medals, and there is so little content that the only thing you will find in this game is premade tracks, some driving mechanics, and a setting page that includes all of the Unity3D preset settings. Classy.Now I'm not totally filled with disgust for this game. I can be a happy guy.Mr. Mario von Rickenbach was so kind enough to include a multiplayer option, where you can both either go head to head, or race other people, and do a derby maybe??? I actually dont know because there isnt a single soul who is online in the game.Plus, there is enough track to keep you happy for 3 hours at the least. thats just below the threshold to refund the game.Just dont let these screenshots fool you, because this is blatently a game from a guy who just jumped out of a long twitter battle with one of his #indiedev buddies and won the battle by using justunfollow.me to DM blast everyone to rate this game on greenlight.Now I could be wrong, I could be right, but heres what you should know: If I missed anything (In which I'm damn sure I did) let me know.

								It's a good racing game :D feels like mario kart. (the one with transformed vehicles what do you call it) and sega/sonic racing transformed.Graphics are pretty, shadows don't go nuts on me, and good fpsControls are slick and cool at the same time.Gameplay: Build the track. Cool :) One thing i would recommend is adding some premade tracks so the player could have some fun on other people's tracks. or even better! make an oval shaped track with 8 gates. and wherever line your on, it goes that way and back to the next gate :) that would be coolonly i don't like is that the developer/s dont update as much anymore but its cool still so yeah :DI'd recommend for the racing fan or the pretty game fan. 9/10			",68,16,1,14,2,0,6

								Good with friends, like these brownies. play games and eat brownies....togetherBROWNIE LAYER:3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter1 1/2 cups bittersweet chocolate chips1 cup granulated white sugar1/2 cup packed light brown sugar4 large eggs1 teaspoon vanilla extract1/2 teaspoon salt1 cup all-purpose flourCOOKIE DOUGH:3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature or almost melted3/4 cup granulated white sugar3/4 cup packed light brown sugar1/4 teaspoon salt2 tablespoons milk or cream1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste1 cup all-purpose flour1 cup miniature chocolate chipsadditional miniature chocolate chips, if desired (to garnish the top)Directions:Prepare the brownie layer-1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9x9-inch pan with nonstick spray, then line with a strip of parchment paper so that it covers the bottom and comes up two sides of the pan. Spray the parchment with nonstick spray too.2. In a microwave safe bowl (or in the top of a double boiler or pan set on top of a pan of simmering water), microwave in 30 second bursts to melt butter and chocolate chips together until all is melted and smooth. Whisk in the sugars, then whisk in the eggs, vanilla and salt. Sift flour into the bowl and stir that in too. Scrape the brownie batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the brownie layer is cooked through (toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean). Place the pan of brownies in the refrigerator to speed up the cooling process (or cool at room temperature and add the cookie dough layer later).Prepare the cookie dough layer:3. In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to combine the butter, sugars and salt until soft and creamy (1 to 2 minutes). Mix in the milk and vanilla. Sprinkle in the flour and mix in until combined. Stir in the 1 cup of chocolate chips. Scoop the cookie dough onto the top of the brownies and spread onto the brownie layer. I find that it's easiest to do this if the brownie layer is chilled and firm. Wet your hands or spray them with nonstick spray and pat the cookie dough on top in a even layer. Sprinkle additional chocolate chips on top to create a nicer, visual appearance. For easy, clean cutting, chill the brownies (wrap the brownies with plastic wrap and chill until firm- 1 to 2 hours or up to 2 days).4. Cut the brownies: Run a knife along the sides of the brownie pan and then use the parchment paper to lift the brownies from the pan and onto a cutting board. Slice the brownies with a sharp knife, wiping the knife with a paper towel between cuts. If you'd like all of your slices of brownies to look clean-cut without edges, use the knife to cut the sides of the brownies off before cutting pieces. Keep brownies slices covered and chilled until ready to serve.			",69,8,2,7,4,0,3

A racer with a difference and a unique aesthetic art style. Krautscape is an action-packed racing game with bird-like flying cars, focused on competitive multiplayer gameplay. The leading player actively builds the racetrack while the chasing players can take shortcuts by flying off the track to overcome obstacles. But the track is needed to score and to get speed – the vehicles don't have any thrusters to accelerate while flying. The three multiplayer game modes are designed to support nonlinear gameplay and intelligent movement instead of forcing you to drive perfectly. - Recommended!			",1016,194,27,62,73,1,89

								The game looks fantastic and the track-building concept is interesting, but the physics are really off-putting. The game simply does not control well at all. You can't feel the road at all and it feels as through you are sliding around on ice most of the time. A racing game needs to have tight controls that help you feel the road. This game does not. Add to the list of cons a progression system that forces you to replay annoying tracks over and over again until you hit a set time before you can progress onto the next track. If it played as good as it looked, there would be a lot to like here. Unfortunately the controls leave me disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Car mode Handles like ♥♥♥. Airplane Mode Handles like.... ♥♥♥. tested with x360 controller and Xb-one controller. Very fun concept.This seems more of an arcade style game but when flying you cannot bank then try to fly down by pressing forward. Like a real plane banking left then pressing forward you suddenly turn right instead of the expected behavior of diving. overall the car at speed tumbles crashes. front end lifts and other sorts of NOT fun behavior.

												Krautscape, a game where I drive, fly, and fall into the never ending abyss. If your not into checkpoint races or multi-player and thus like me then do not get this game as that is all the single player really is. I have no idea if the multi-player is alright or not, but what little of the single player I did play was killed for me by having to meet near impossible time trial goals for medals to unlock the next levels. The difficulty with meeting said goals lies with steering the damnable car itslef, which turns a little better then I imagine a lead brick might. Overall I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone unless they really like simple but incredibly frustrating (challenging) control scemes. Also the flying isn't really flying, at best it's gliding with style and only really usuable on tracks where you are meant to use it and only when you are meant to use it. That said my experience only involves the first 1st or 2nd levels of each type of game mode as I just literally could not get passed them so I can't claim any sort of deep knowledge here but perhaps that speaks for itself in a way.

								Few things i like and things i dont like.Likes: Good change of pace from usual racing. Good idea of race tracks. Gives off a new kind of high.Dislikes: Needs to improve on building tracks (like the tutorial needs to teach players how to finish tracks, I couldn't finish nor save any tracks), there needs to be different types of racing vehicles, It felt like a mix between FWD and AWD, but turning mechanics was awkward. I would enter a corner like a FWD, but exit like an AWD. Also, I wanted to know whether or not the wings had any effect on turning, wind resistance, drag coefficients, and downforce. There should be a menu on types of vehicles to choose and characteristics, like different style wings (concentrating more on mid air speed, turning speed, road speed, etc) mainly for individual racing benefits and disadvantages, this would make players think twice before choosing the best type of settings for the race. Building race tracks need more improvement for versatility, I ended up with bunch of turns that I didn't want, instead i wanted loops, jumps, etc. This would be excellent if it could incorporate building tracks like ""Trackmania,"" it gives more control over how a track can be created, deleted, modified. Also, I felt some major lag while turning. Like, as the game went on, the memory started to stack upwards, then the turning would delay, maybe because it had to save, and build up memory while racing. I played this on highest graphic settings. I would love to see updates to improve on this. Also, I would like to see ""key bindings"" in options, because it took me a while to find out what ""C"" button did. Also, sound settings need improvement, like sound vs. bgm music. I turned off sound but i kept hearing acceleration sounds, beeping sounds, etc. If the game allowed drifting, even in midair. I bet this game would hit at least, top 5 games of 2014-15.

												While this game has a compelling hook and a uniquely interesting presentation, the core experience of driving is too vanilla to recommend. As a car, the physics are lacking, and the handling felt uninspired. I also felt I was battling the controls (keyboard and mouse), either turning too much or too little, or diving when I should have been climbing in the air. THe latter is due to the unfortunate fact that the same up key that causes you to accelerate as a car sends you into a dive when you transform.			",58,18,4,5,5,0,11

								I don't play other racing games so I can't speak to how Krautscape compares to them, but I like it, and here's why:- The gliding mechanic is super cool. I mean, really, really fun.- The play modes are all quite different from each other. With ping-pong in particular it's easy for the lead to change often, which is good.- Playtime can be short and still satisfying. I find it hard to find a game I really like that doesn't take hours for a good session, so this is a valuable trait in my book.As others have said, it would be nice to have a bigger community playing online. I played it with a game partner at home and the LAN was a bit funky (he could join my game but I couldn't join his for some reason); I'm sure they'll get that sorted, though. I recommend without reservation.			",23,16,2,9,7,0,6

								A complete utter piece of ♥♥♥♥ is presented here. I wasted nearly 1 hour waiting on the online only to discover it doesn't work. The controls are like the controls that are to sensitive on a striaght track. And on the cornera you bash into the sides and your timed on the drive and fly mode and I know. ''DUDE U R SNOB MAN UNGRATRFUL ♥♥♥♥♥ HERE GUYZ DONT LIZTEN TO THIS CRAP! U CAN FRIEKIN FLY''. But you have to pick up speed befor flying and your bound to crash and come off the over side and fall off the track when you land. Suggestion. Get it AFTER EARLY ACCES!!!			",46,9,0,0,4,1,1
