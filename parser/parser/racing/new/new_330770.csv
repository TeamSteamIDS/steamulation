Early Access Review
								I absolutely love the concept of this game. It's definitely tons of fun... for the first hour or so. My major problem is, there's really no diversity in the tracks, aside from them looking different. Each track still plays the exact same way and doesn't change. They feel very.... static to me. There's no real hazards in the levels, and the only way you can pass someone is if you time your speedups right and don't mess up, or wait for them to mess up. But as it stands right now, it's fairly easy to be that ""perfect player"" that hits all the speed boosts and doesn't mess up.I don't want to be that guy, but the tracks should be more engaging and dynamic, because they just feel bland. And this is just a suggestion, but why not add some special abilities to the vehicles, and the white aura thingies recharge said abilities? For example, let's say vehicle A's special ability is a minor speed boost, and vehicle B's ability is a knockback, and vehicle C's would be something like missiles that slow down a target in front of you? Something along those lines would definitely keep player retention. Of course, there would have to be a lot of balancing of vehicles to ensure fair play. But that's just it. In its current form, it's a novelty that is fun for about an hour or two. But after that, it becomes incredibly dull. You've got the formula down, now you just need to figure out how to keep player retention, so that people will want to play for hours on end.I do love everything else about this game; it reminds me of this weird techno-motorcycle game I used to play on the N64. As bland as the gameplay is, the graphics are beautiful. The levels really feel alive, like when asteroids come wizzing past you as you're trying to pass the guy in front of you. I like how you can reverse gravity too, definitely a cool mechanic that needs to be utilized in a wider variety of scenarios. It looks very polished and refined, visually. I will give you guys credit for that. I'm not a fan of the game's soundtrack, but I can't really complain about it because it isn't that bad. Although I do wish it was more diverse. The soundtrack of any game is what really gets me immersed in the moment. For example in an RPG, where epic music plays on a huge boss fight with the choir singing and whatnot, and makes your hair stand up like you know you're about to have a great time. Soundtracks that can give me goosebumps like that are usually automatic likes for me. I like the techno theme this game brings, I just see a whole lot more potential than what's being presented. Throw in some dude shredding an electric guitar or something on one of em, or perhaps a solo violin segment on one of the levels with a more serene atomosphere, give it some flavor. Or who knows, maybe you can come up with something even more crazy that ends up working really well. But most importantly, a memorable track should have a discernible melody. Maybe that melody could be the game's leitmotif or something. Just some suggestions. I'm no expert.I realise this is still early access, which is why I'm writing this at all. Hopefully my thoughts will reach the developers this way. I'm going to not recommend this game for right now, simply because it feels sort of bland. But there's plenty of room for improvement. Spice the gameplay up a bit! Good luck!			",29,8,1,3,7,1,6

								Great game, sorta like F-Zero except instead of being on a flat 2-dimensionalish track, you are on a round snake like track which you are free to move and rotate around.  Sorta think of a monorail which you can move freely around.  Unlike a standard racing track which you may slam against a side wall or guardrail, you are able to rotate freely around the track, allowing for a huge amount of racing space.  This creates a need for ""driving"" skill since unlike a traditional raceway there tends to be very little bottlenecking where you can fight aggressively against your opponents. Instead, you have to focus on maneuvering around the track, dodging slowdown shields and trying to hit every booster you can, in order to get your highest possible speed.  In it's current state, the game is very fun and feels polished, but there are few tracks and ships to choose from, which is to be expected from an early access title.  Due to the lack of ""content"" at this point, the races can become very repetitive.  As the game updates however, we should expect to see more added content, adding for a more unique experience each race.  If you are looking for a racer in which you can immerse yourself, and spend hours playing, look elsewhere for the moment.  If you are willing to take the slight lack of content built on top of a quality core and give it a test drive, this is a great title to look into.  I personally look forward to keeping up with updates and trying out the new features as the game becomes more immersive with features, and hope others are willing to do the same.

												Awfully flat, both visually and in terms of gameplay.  It's an exercise in rolling around a worm and trying to hit the boost pads.  Sometimes you avoid red barricades.  You might jump occasionally.  Even more occasionally, you might get to drive on the roof.  And that's pretty much the sum total of Radial-G.

								I've been using the DEMO of Radial-G to show off the Oculus Rift to friends. It's a crowd pleaser and something I can show that is actually interactive and a game. Lately I go to work and I start to fantisize about what kind of VR experience I want when I get home... I keep choosing the DEMO of Radial-G. The thrill I get out of the speed of this game is addicting. I finally caved in and bought the full game (early access) and I am not only not ecstatic  I did... I'm freaking out how much they have already improved it! It's F-Zero come to life! Anyway... I'm going back into VR. I highly recommend this if you're an Oculus Rift owner.			",223,104,4,48,36,3,27

								I've played Radial-G since the Kickstarter demo, and I absolutely love this game! It's like a cross between wipEout and Ballistics (remember that?) and it's just so fun to play. Tammeka Games has created the best expression of going fast that is available on Steam, and the early access is only the beginning.I play this on a normal monitor and it plays absolutely fine.

								Great VR racing game.The game is good even without VR.  Admittedly at first, I was hoping for a Wipeout clone... this isn't it.  It's actually different and I think better.   It's like a Wipeout game, but for a new age.   Add VR...A latest patch (v0.9) makes VR easy and work very well.  One of the very best VR games I've played so far.  I'd recommend this games for any fan of this type of racing, and this is a MUST HAVE game for anybody with VR.(playing with a DK1, I'm sure newer tech will be even better) ",672,226,65,78,76,9,89

								Despite needing to better implement Direct 2 Rift this is my goto game for showing the how awesome the Rift can be.Its almost flawless in its execution.Neither me nor anyone else I've shown it to has ever felt nausea. However the recent update causes judder in direct 2 rift mode, but changing to extended makes it better (please fix direct 2 rift mode though).This game has the potential to be every bit as awesome and fun as games like F-ZeroX and Wipeout, and its very much getting there. 20 more ships and 20 more tracks (I like variety) and it will be the best space-racing game I know, and well within my top 5 games ever.Also something similar to FZero-Xs bump right and left would be cool or a Wipeout type weapon system, anything where we can really ruin your fellow racers day would be greatSo yea A+++ and I'm looking forward to smashing you off mah damn tube in multiplayer.

								Radial-G is an essential purchase for all owners of the DK2, the graphics are great looking and really focus on DK2's strengths. Most PC users will find no issues in maintaining a high frame rate to eliminate any feeling of queasiness that other poorer performing games generate.The controls are simple enough that if you choose to use the game to Demo your Oculus Rift to friends/family/coworker anybody will be able to pick up a control pad and start playing. The racing action is high speed frantic fun, a white knuckle chase to the end. You will find you self smiling a lot as you play this game, that's natural. It's your bodies way of telling you just how much fun you are having.			",272,32,19,17,25,4,36

												To the developers: I don't want you to be discouraged. VR is going to change the world, and I want skilled, creative developers to build a name for themselves from the start. This is just my opinion, and if you passionately disagree, then do what you think is best.To the consumers: I understand that the market is small, and as such, VR games are relatively more expensive. That said, I still think $25 is too much for what this is. The tracks/race mechanics feel dated, the music wasn't gripping, and as a result, it just couldn't compete against the rest of my VR library. When I got in, I just kept asking ""Why am I even trying to win?"" Sure, to unlock the next levels (and ultimately the locked ships), but it felt like the game was wanting me to experience something beyond a simple arcade racing sim. Like it was telling me it had a backstory, when none was present.For example: Price aside, this is just the importance of music. Holopoint, a VR archery game, is pretty simple and light on content, but the music is extremely complementary to the experience, making it a ton of fun. Granted, if they charged $25, I'd probably pass based on the content, but they didn't. They sold themselves as an arcade-style game, and they delivered on that very nicely.Radial-G's art direction was very nice, and the ships and cockpits were nicely detailed. With some changes, I could see myself rebuying this one for sure (suggestions below). It's not a mess of a game, it just feels incomplete in its current state.Maybe Radial-G is the most amazing game two hours into it, but half an hour in, it wasn't, and as a consumer, I just don't want to wait to find out. I have other games in my library that I'd rather play NOW. If I waited for every game that wasn't fun off the bat, I'd have wasted many hours of my life taking two hours to find out what I could take a half an hour to find out.What I would suggest, based on my own interests: 1) It would have made it a lot more interesting for me if I got to see the other racers. Weird alien creatures, or seedy criminal-looking characters; something that leads you to inherently like or dislike your competitors based on your tastes, like the F-Zero games, for example.2) Music that just caused you to really worry about winning; something that made you feel like you're in an intense movie, you're the hero, and you have to win in that very moment.3) Some reason for me to really care about winning. Is there a bad guy who's the number one racer? Or maybe winning races earns me some cash to upgrade my ride and feel more invested in my career (considering how many races there were to unlock). TL;DR  It's not a bad title, but it just feels like it could use some extra depth for the price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I also demoed this for a LAN-party at university and it was a huge success, everybody loved it. The fact you have to tilt your head to look up for example when the track goes up beyond your view to look ahead is super imersive. 3 tracks isn't very much, but will come more.

								Highly recommended! This is just insane in a Rift DK2! The graphics look amazing and the gameplay is hypnotic! You can really groove in on this one. As far as stellar Rift games and sims, this one is right up there. The menus are wonderfully polished, the neon graphics look beautiful, and the controls are right there! This is a go-to game for demoing the Rift or just spending some time under the hood. It's easy for new Rifters to pick up but requires a lot of skill to drive it well. You truly get transported to other worlds all while screaming around a twisty tubular alien track. For driving I love Assetto Corsa but the menus take a little juggling. For flying it's DCS but there are issues with minor stutter and also menus. Radial-G is the total package. You fire it up, put on the Rift, and immerse in a really bizarre alien world to race around in. Simple but tons of fun. Again, highly recommended!One thing to be aware of, though. I had my joystick plugged in and it had control of Radial-G instead of my game pad. The joystick might be great, but for this, I like the pad. Anyway, if you are having trouble with the controls, try unplugging any joysticks, wheels, or whatever, and see if that doesn't make it all better. I just saw a scathing review where a guy said the controls didn't work. I bet he had something else plugged in and the computer just saw the other controller first.			",7,10,4,0,17,0,0

								Radial-G Racing is a solid experience.  It has fun tracks, a great environment and works great with the Oculus Rift (DK2 used).  If only other titles worked so seamlessly with it!In its current state as of this review, there are 3 vehicles to choose from and 3 different tracks.  The vehicle choices seem cosmetic right now.  The tracks are all in the same asteroid/space setting.  It looks awesome and fits in well with the style.  Races consist of driving along a giant cable with the ability to rotate completely around it.  There are boosts scattered around the cable and depending on the race style, red gates to avoid that if hit, will greatly slow you down.  Races are a chaotic frenzy of rotating to catch boost pads and dodge gates, jumps and avoiding falling off the track when the cable splits.  With the rift, it just feels right and amazing.  It's dizzying in a good way.  Looking around the cockpit of the ship is cool.  Suggestions for the future of the game:- More race types.  No gates and regular are excellent.  Death Race seemed very limited/short... I'm not sure I would play that mode again.  - A weapons mode or power ups similar to mario kart or the like.  - A no boost (no ship boost, no boost pads) mode to allow racers to really test their skill at navigating the track the most efficient way.If you own a rift, you should own this game.  If you don't own a rift, you should still own this game (if you enjoy racing). ",225,89,7,38,53,4,43

The game has been updated considerably since my first review.Radial G is a futuristic racing game inspired by F-Zero. Radial-G is sadly nothing special. Gameplay is boring & very repetitive. The AI does not provide any fair challenge.Either the AI is insanely far ahead or it's stuck respawning time after time in the same position. The individual worlds are beautiful and very well designed. Tracks on the other handare uninspiring and very 'cramped'. Even though you have the ability to rotate around the hole track tube, they don't feel 'open'. Only specific areas of the track allow you to leaveand even at that, you respawn instantly. You don't have the option of trying to fly back onto the track. They're rocket ships but can't fly?Performance is ten-folds better now compared to when I wrote my last review. Game is at a steady 60fps. No more stuttering or slowdowns. As I mentioned before, the game looks great.Sound effects are great but dull. Either they're too quiet or lack bass / treble. I almost expected to have the sounds screaming & blaring intensely. I felt nothing as if the soundsare placeholders. I love the sound track. Brings me back to the days of Destruction Derby series, F-Zero, Vigilante 8, and early twisted metal. I'm not a fan of the UI. The UI is generic and doesn't look like it fit with Radial-G. Looks exactly like Unity's example asset UI. The UI does not allow for mouse control or tab control.Quality options is very limited. Radial-G uses Unity3D. Unity has a huge list of options for developers to implement into their games. Radial-G only allows for Resolution change and a simplequality switch low, medium, high. I seriously think that Radial-G would benefit from having ultra widescreen / multi monitor support. The UI does not scale to ultra widescreen / multi monitorand the FOV is not properly adjusted.This game could be improved so much but it doesn't seem like the devs care or they have moved onto another game. I do not recommend getting Radial-G for $25. Wait for it to go on sale.

												I was very unsure about this game when I first started researching VR games to buy, but I'm glad I did. The negative comments people have made about lack of map variety are true to some extent, but the adrenaline rush of each race more than compensates for that in imho. Even better, the developers appear to be taking those reviews seriously, and the list of updates they have planned is very impressive. If you like racing games and want to experience a great on in VR, look no further!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I'm a huge fan of F-Zero GX for the GC, and this game brings back many of those fond memories I have. It's fast-paced, intense, and requires some mad maneuvering to land on those boosts / avoid the gates. I'm excited to see what content the devs bring to this.			",59,3,0,18,0,0,17

								Revisiting this game after a while and a lot has changed! Better sound (engine sound), new content and now weapons added.  I play this game in VR (Vive) and it looks stunning.  Real sense of presence.Tracks look stunning and the sense of speed is impressive.  For those who think this game consists of just avoiding red gates and hitting speed boosts.. wrong.  When racing with a faster ship you need to get used to breaking on some turns.  Combat mode makes it a whole lot more involved as you have to try and avoid competitor weapons and pick up weapons yourself.Radial-G should be regarded as a showcase game for VR.

												Updated Review: Spending more time reflecting on my experience.Experience is quite charming on the Rift 1.3.2.2.210591.Overall graphics are quite coherent with themselve, good techno soundtrack, quick pace actions. I really the esthetics of the area the main menu is in. I've done the first tournament and a few single races. There seems to be plenty of content to sink hours in until your get enough of the game, the three rigs available at first are enough considering the complexity of the title. On the other hands, you never can have too much choice. Kudos for having a female character. I also like the cockpit view. It though to look at it while keep an eye on the race but assume it was made in consequence. I wish the shield status was easier to see though.Got confortable within a minute of racing, then felt great, engaged and immersed.Other notes: I would've liked if driver hands would animate a bit with speed as it currently feels a bit static in the cockpit. Too much movement would be annoying but a little something would be nice. Like a thumb movement proportionnal to the rigs' speed (like how you drive a vtt). I found the use of shield and it's current state a bit unclear.Otherwise, fun stuff!			",235,67,3,28,7,3,15

												Reviewed with HTC Vive Consumer Gen 1 and an Xbox One Wireless Controller.Absolutely brutal first person racing game. It reminds me of somewhere between Audiosurf's track and atmosphere and Captain Falcon's F-Zero. Gameplay Breakdown:Control the camera with the head-tracked movement. Use the joystick to move left and right. Aim for the green boost pads to speed up while avoiding the red slowdown lasers and driving off the track into endless space. Enemy racers can be damaged and eventually blown up by high-speed impact.Pros: +Incredible headtracking and cockpit.. Look around without missing a beat.+Tight racing controls on an Xbox One Wireless Controller.+The feeling of speed you get from the VR perspective is hard to put to words. My one friend had to calm down from the adrenaline rush after playing his first race.+Complete offline mode with Career, single races, and time trials.+Very nice track design and visual effects!Cons:-I could see it causing motion sickness in those prone to it.A definite reccomendation!

								This game has a pretty much all the good aspects of an exemplary Early Access title:-Awesome developers that openly communicate-A mostly pristine gaming experience, with limited content as the game is still being built up-A price tag that doesn't overshoot closer to AAA retail prices like some other Early Access games haveAt the moment, the game only features a limited number of tracks and some concepts are still being built up. I have a problem with falling off the track at the splits, but the devs have clarified to me that the splits are experimental, and that there should be less over time, being restricted to more difficult tracks. In addition to that, my suggestions for difficulty mechanisms replacing ""falling off the track"" were well received.So far it definitely looks like Radial-G is headed to be an experience worthy of comparison to the greats like F-Zero. While this game is already awesome on screen, with its impeccable Oculus Rift support, it's even a greater experience in VR!			",118,17,6,4,16,0,1

												I know I haven't played it for long, but the reasons why I can't recommend it aren't very hard to check 5 minutes in. I actually went through with testing the actual game instead of judging it on its cover, but it still feels the same after a handful of races with a few ships : this game looks and feels cheap.The trailer made me think it could be like a not so hard but slick racing game. I had seen previews and hands on online, obviously focused on the VR aspect of the game. Anyone who's ever played a Wip3out game inside the cockpit or Ballistics knows how intense the experience can become with a VR headset. Being a fan of the later, I was hyped, hooked, or whatever...So here I am, and here it is.The game itself is OK at best. Nothing like a good old face strecher heart pumping techno blasting awesome futuristic suicidal speedy racing game, but... like ""OK, that will do for now"".I can't comment on the VR aspect off the game, though I will say that if playing it VR is the only way to make it really enjoyable and unforgettable, that means that we're still in early relationship with VR and once everything sets up, we'll  broke up and part ways, thinking that was a stupid idea to blast 900€ on a VR headset just for ""that"". Racing games can be awesome and awful for numberous reasons, none of which have anything to do with the existence of a headset on your head.If the game is no good without VR, it is no good with it. Again, wait 'till the VR hype calms down, and look at your games for what they really are.In that case, we have an OK racing game, with a TERRIBLE menu design, and an overall bad taste/cheap feeling. Like if they had to rush it like hell so that they could meet with VR market deadlines (I suppose that's what happened, it wouldn't be a surprise).The menus are bad in that sense each sub-level feels like it has been made by a different person, without considering talking to each other and agree on some sort of plan. Let's overlook the fact that it's ugly (no accounting for taste), it's just obviously lacking polish and design. If you enter career mode, you can choose a ship and the the type of racing (different ingame rules) and go for it, but if you enter single race mode, you choose your ship, then the track... and then here comes another menu, pretty much like a main menu, but inside the track... where you can also change your ship and choose track settings... what the... why isn't it like the other one ?And why on earth do I gain XP points for finishing a track ?! What for ?!Let's get this straight : if the game was ONLY about racing, like you just press Start and you immediatly start a race and then jump to the next one, without any menu or anything, it would be so much better than this version ! No XP, no clumsy options, no career mode (that I happen to broke/bug exploit just by going back to change my ship), no nothing. Just pure racing.Since it's a (big) polish issue, I suspect they can still patch it up and work it out, but history shows it won't happen. So in the time being, let's not recommend this game. Play it if you need your fix right now or if you're high up on VR sensations.Otherwise, don't.			",307,77,2,41,28,2,49

								This game is one of the most frenetic experiences I had in VR. I'm a defensive driver in real life, but the intense feeling of speed and flow gives me a very satisfying experience I did not think I would enjoy as much as I do. The game feels very futuristic. The different parts of a race track vary between superfast tight curves and long curves/straights with stunning vistas of the surrounding alien cyberstructures.  The newer levels also add a lot more track design ideas like jumps from convex to concave tubes and back, see-through lanes or spirally twisted lanes.The soundtrack is consisting of very fitting and quite tasteful techno/electro tracks and seems to be updated with new additions as well. Despite the fast pace with all the constant spins, turns and jumps I have gotten zero sim sickness from the game. Playable with the keyboard but much better with a controller, because the analogue stick helps a lot for precise steering over the speed-ups and through the rotating gates.This is one of my favourite games vor Virtual Reality and highly recommended.

								Radial-G has, by far, the best and easiest to use Oculus implementation I have experienced. The design of the game plays to the strengths of the DK2 but more importantly it has direct mode support instead of relying on the janky extended mode. You can launch the game from 2D desktop or from Steam's VR mode flawlessly. The only problem I have is with the controls. I am using a Logitech F13 Dual Shock. The feedback does not seem to work and there is a laggy feeling in the menus and when turning. I tried using Xinput and DirectInput mode. When switching to Xinput it seemed to fix itself at first before eventually drifting into a noticable delay.  ",126,51,0,19,9,0,22

								If I had reviewed this game 6 months ago it would be less positive. Back then the game was fairly unstable, but even back then when I COULD get it to run (on a 3 year old laptop built for home use, not gaming) it was really fun. Now I have a powerful gaming rig and a stable build of the game. And it's amazing.Pros:- The concept is really unique and definitely enthralling.- The entire aesthetic compliments the gameplay, as well as being amazing on it's own.- This is the first racing game in years i've felt compelled to play.Con: - It's a bit of a nitpick, but still important to list that those who are more sensitive to motion sickness may want to steer away from this game.

								Very cool futuristic racer, supports Occulus (which I don't own, but for those of you who do, I imagine it's a cool experience in VR). Since I've purchased the game they have added a couple new tracks, leaderboards, and a third person view. All great additions. I recommend this game even though I don't have many hours logged into it. Usually I just pick it up and play a race or two  or a few laps of Lap Attack.I do hope more people give this game a chance, it was a solid purchase in my eyes.			",469,97,57,50,116,7,61

I'm hoping to see in the near future more ships, and possibly the ability to build your own ships, kind of like the ship building in F-Zero on Gamecube. I enjoy all the current tracks. Very challenging. It would also be great to see additional tracks that are not just cylindrical. Local 2-Player would also be awesome! Again, I love this game in Early Access, so I am very excited to see whats to come! Great job to all at Tammeka Games! I'm excited for whats to come!			",31,3,1,5,1,0,0

Early Access Review
								This is simply one of the best VR games to date.Currently on DK2 with SDK 0.8 and direct to rift works perfectly.No stutters, no lazy 3D menu programming that requires you to use your monitor first and then go to the rift after joining a race. None of that bs you find in so many other games.I played a bit before using the Oculus to get a feel for the game in 2D as well. And it feels pretty good in either setup.But the Oculus Rift does give you an advantage as you can look around and see what's coming.This is THE game I'll be using to demo the Rift to friends and family from this point on.
