Early Access Review
								There are plenty of reviews out there which focus on the game, so I'll focus mine on the devs.Between the game's private beta and the public release on Steam, it has been updated numerous times already. Not just adding features along the way, but also implementing user feedback (ranging from bug reports to game suggestions) from the community. They devs are super approachable, but stay true to the game and their vision.This isn't EA reviving an old franchise to churn out ♥♥♥♥. This is cool dudes making a cool game: we actually care edition.Even so, that's not enough. I'll tell you why I have faith in this project, despite it's early access status:Rob spent a lot of his free time to update the PC port of Rollcage, 15 years after it's initial release, to please old fanboys who couldn't let go of the game. I'm talking rewriting the rendering engine, rewriting of the audio engine, rewriting of the networking system, all to make it work better on modern operating systems.Now he's working on GRIP, earning less than he would have working a regular job, but he's doing it out of love.David is another one of those blokes who worked on the original Rollcage games. Obviously he's not nearly as amazing as Rob, but this guy went dumpsterdiving (in his attic) and dug out some sweet nostalgia from the Rollcage developing-days for us to gaze at.Also, this man made a few of the Rollcage tracks many have grown to love (or hate) and was the producer of Stage II. Dude's an expert on making you feel good. He made me feel good and I want him to do it again.Chris is the one who got the project started and he's cool as a cucumber. He knows that if he messes up in any way, people will come to stalk him in Canada.Luckily, for his own sake, he hasn't messed up yet and actually gives the impression that he 'gets' what people want/like.Probably has something to do with him being a fan of the Rollcage games as well.There are quite a few more helping hands behind the scenes, but I honestly haven't communicated with them all that much yet.(Despite it being super easy[forum.cagedelement.com]).Either way, this game is in good hands.

PROS:Great sense of speed and a unique verticality to the racing that adds a lot of depth in comparison to traditional Kart racers.Very faithful to the original Rollcage game.Satisfying weaponry compounded by the great visuals of the Unreal 4 engine makes the game look good. ~95% 60fps with my GTX770 on all epic settings outside of post processing which murders the framerate.CONS:As a Pre-Alpha the game lacks content, no online multiplayer and only 3 race maps, 2 of which are WIP.Cars slide a bit too easily making it difficult to land after hitting jumps and small bumps.Track design uses invisible walls a bit too much (mainly in the incomplete maps).Grip is a fantastic pre-alpha, and it makes me excited to see how the game develops through its time in early access. The driving is satisfying, the combat feels brutal, and the current tracks are all both fun to drive on and beautiful to look at. The only real problems I have with the game outside of current lack of content are more of personal preferences and small balance issues that can and will be fixed throughout the development of the game. Once this game gets multiplayer and a few more tracks this will be a definite buy for those looking for a fun, high skill high depth kart racing experience.			",228,50,7,23,40,3,37

								1st race: I blew it. Stone cold last, 10th place,2nd race: Getting the feel for it, 8th place,3rd race: It all came flooding back from Rollcage. I was in the frae from the start to end, jostling for position with missiles going over head, cars driving above me, machine guns disrupting my steering, explosions blasting competitors out of the way and that unmistakable bleeping of a missile locking on to me,  it was 4 laps of my heart going as fast as my car, huge smile on my face, action packet, 400kph combat racing. This is what the game is about, ow and I got 3rd place.			",693,122,33,79,68,11,123

								If you played Rollcage (Deathtrack Racing) or Rollcage Stage 2 on the PS1 or PC, this game should be on your radar.If you like dirty, filthy drum and bass, this game should be on your radar.If you are interested in the idea of driving on the ceiling firing a chaingun or missiles at other racers in flippable cars that weigh tonnes at upwards of 400kph, this should be on your radar.If you enjoy noisy, speedy, action-packed fun, see above.The developers are actively updating and listening to the players, yes, it's early access, but it holds genuine pedigree, former Attention To Detail (Rollcage, Rollcage S2) developers are in the development team and they have been working constantly with meaty updates, it keeps getting better.Multiplayer currently has split-screen mode, online will be coming later.The cars feel weighty, weapons have that carthatic sensation, the music bangs away nicely.Recommended, even in early access.

Early Access Review
								Despite being So early in development this game is incredible, even with just single race mode and arena mode at the moment it is so much fun, the cars feel Strong and ""meaty"" if a little unstable at the moment, the finish and polish of the rendering engine is incredible this game already looks stunning. The weapons take this game to its own level with beautiful locking rockets and frustratingly accurate machine guns the shield have some of the best design work I’ve ever seen.AS of this review Split screen has just been launched, and works a treat using 2 Xbox controllers, more support is apparently coming but if you don’t have 2 controllers ""x360ce"" works a treat for faking it. And honestly i can’t wait for online multiplayer; i know it’s likely quite far off in development. But hell I’ve sunk 20 hours in already just racing around with the AI and I’m still having so much fun with it.The latest update has added a third racing track (very early in development) as well as making some massive improvements to the other two. New weapon has been added called the Assassin which is a beautifully destructive tracking missile.Updates have been regular having 5 BIG updates since the games pre alpha release in November (its Feb 2nd now)All in all i can’t recommend this game enough, even this early in development I feel that it’s worth every penny of the asking price right now update november 2016Still loving this game Content updates are stiill frequent and substancial, this game is makeing big strides towards completion			",106,10,7,2,9,1,1

Early Access Review
								In the modern world of gaming, a lot of venerated video game genres have died a slow death - most notably the 90s platformer.Another genre that suffered the same fate was the combat racer.And just like the 90s platformer, the combat racer has risen from the grave with GRIP.I did not grow up in the heyday of these games - I was four years old when Rollcage was released, and the most combat-est of a racing game I played was the PS2's Rumble Racing (which was amazing).For the longest time, I have been searching for a racing game that was not an uber-realism Gran Turismo wannabe, and here it is. It saddens me when I ask someone if they enjoy racing games, and they say 'no, I don't like Forza or Project CARS'. There is so much more to the genre than having the highest polycount vehicle model.This is a racing game for people who don't usually play racing games. It's easy to learn but difficult to master. You can play it for 10 minutes, or 100. It's versatile, loud, engaging, and strikes the perfect balance of inducing righteous fury at the guy who hit you with a missile while not making you so angry you quit the game.Most importantly - it's fun to lose.For myself, who grew up with Rumble Racing, Motorstorm, Test Drive: Eve of Destruction, and Jak X, I can immediately see that the developers care about what they are doing. The music is amazing, the environments are stunning, the motion blur is excellent, the particle effects are the right mix of sensibility and EXPLOSION. Each sound and visual is tailored so that you know exactly what is happening on screen. As your vehicle gets more damaged, your HUD begins to lose integrity in a fantastically thematic way. The vehicles feel meaty and weighty, and you rarely feel like a crash was the fault of the physics engine.EDIT: Okay, not rarely. Usually. The physics engine is the devs' current main focus, and while it's come a long way, your car will still do some wacky things on occasion.It is in early access, so there are bugs. There is an excellent forum for reporting, and bugs are constantly being fixed by the dev team.We need to prove to the world that games that aren't MOBAs, arena shooters, or freemium microtransaction stores can SUCCEED. Buy this game, and invest in both the future of the game industry and the future of your procrastination time simultaneously.			",133,21,7,11,19,1,12

Early Access Review
 I've received a copy for reviewing, yet this hasn't affected my review.  It's finally here...The successor for the PlayStation and PC game, Rollcage, has arrived in full force! The current version gives us on the plate three game modes (Race, Arena, Playground), one car and plenty of stages for now. The single problem I had so far was the lack of control, steering of the car proved to be really difficult and I could not maintain my first place at all, I hope it is going to get fixed as soon as possible for a smoother gameplay, I pretty much felt like a newbie. It is one of the few cons I've found so far in the game, the rest of it is simply divine. Gameplay Going onto the game modes, race let us compete against computer controlled cars with some intense combat in the package, basically high speed chasing after the first place with miniguns and missiles. Sad thing is, there's only miniguns, two types of missiles and landmines so far and I'd love some more diversity in the weaponry, but it's early access so they'll probably develop some more in the meantime. While racing gives us a combat for the first place, arena is a merciless carnage where all drivers are put to fight against each other with the mentioned arsenal at disposition along with a speed boost and shield (They are also in the race mode, do not fret) powerup. Then, comes the playground mode where it pits the player to find all the 42 packages on a map that looks like a construction site but also gives us a few hints as of what destruction to expect later on (In the site map you can destroy walls, pillars) yet I ran into the problem that if you crash into certain places and get stuck you can't respawn but to exit and restart it from the start. Graphics The stages are pure eye candy, just stunning and extremely detailed even for the ones that are prototypes. They all have a different setting which makes them unique but, there's something that bugs me and those are the barricades in the tunnels which are really easy to hit and can make you fall down in the leaderboard to the last place quite fast. OST & SFX The soundtrack? Drum and bass is enough for an eargasm and some chills down the spine as you destroy your way to the first place! Should you buy it? Grip is already a masterpiece and has met my expectations. You should buy it as soon as possible, because this is a gem that shouldn't be missing from your game collection and its the best experience you can get for this price.

								I had the great opportunity to test this game in the private testing phase and I loved it since the very first version!It's really well made and you can see the love they have for the game translated into the gameplay and attention to detail :)Now if the game is that good in early stages imagine in the future!EDIT: I'm in the future now!Better handling and lot's of fixes in a short period of time! So yeah still looking good :)EDIT: Until now I have no complains cause updates really change the game a lot and they don't take years to come. Each update makes the game even better so for me this is the example of what a early access game should be.And guess what? Multiplayer is here baby!Just buy it and support the devs so the game can be even better cause this game is our savior for the long dead futuristic combat racing genre!!!****************************WARNING****************************Yeah the game is difficult but it's not a bad thing. If you like really easy games just don't buy the game and 10 minutes later post a bad review making a game that some of us love get bad reputation :( I'm not a good player so follow my example and keep trying! Don't give a thumbs down cause you're a casul :)****************************WARNING**************************** ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								GRIP is pretty cool!  We need more of these combat racers.  The graphics engine used is perfect, Unreal 4 does a great job here.  For an early-stage alpha, it shows great promise.The problem is that I think the controls are a little sluggish.  I can notice at least a 0.25s input lag on every turn of the joystick.  It made it difficult to play, to be honest.  I'm normally very good at racing games, but this game made me feel like I had never played a racer before.  Each time I had to avoid an object, it was like I pressed the controls too late.  Even on easy mode, with the rubberband ""catch up"" mode enabled, I can barely avoid make last place in a race.  It's actually almost impossible for me, and when I compare my reaction times with something face paced like Race The Sun, this game feels like there is an old grandma at the wheel.  PLEASE make the turning reaction quicker!  There are only a few modes right now; racing, arena, and playground.  Racing I found too difficult due to lag, and that leaves arena as a focus point.  Well, there are machine guns and rocket launchers.  It's very ordinary.  We need many, many more weapons to make it interesting.  But it's a good start.  Playground could be fun, but there's only one map right now, they should let us explore the racing maps and arena maps too.  In the one ""construction"" map, there is some fun to be had here, but a problem I had is that you cannot respawn.  If you get stuck, you need to exit and enter the map again.  There are 42 packages to find in the playground map, but you need to find them all before you get stuck somewhere, as every time you reload the map you need to start over.  Lame!  Let us just find all 42 packages once, or at least remember which ones we previously found, otherwise it's not an easter egg hunt anymore.  A fix for this would be to make the respawn button just respawn us at the beginning of the map.  Also, in playground mode there is some excellent examples of map destruction (walls to destroy, pillars) which I suppose are previews of what to expect later.  These are really cool.  But for some reason you can't play local co-op in playground mode.  This would have been the most fun!!!The map design for the races are done very well.  There are only a couple that do not have ""VERY EARLY ALPHA PROTOTYPE"" plastered all over the thumbnails, but to be honest they are all very good.  It was never the maps that threw me off, and they are all very unique and well though out.  Except that one where you go through tunnels and have to somehow fit in a pathway that is the width of the car.  Please remove or limit the size of these little barriers.  I have never been able to make it through that gap.  It's a problem.  Especially with how sluggish the controls are.So overall, the game is very hard to recommend.  However it IS an early access alpha, and it looks great.  It feels right, but not tight.  It's just in need of a few more maps and weapons before it's ready.  The hard part is done, now they just need to finish it.  I'm really looking forward to seeing patches for this game come rolling down the pipeline and to watch it progress.

Early Access Review
								This is a spiritual successor to the ""Rollcage"" series from the late 1990's/early 2000's, which means that if you liked Rollcage, you'll absolutely love this, and if you've never played Rollcage but like fast-paced combat racers focused on skill, you're at least certain to like this a lot. Think Trackmania mixed with Mariokart mixed with Rocket League, and you pretty much have this series of games, it's challenging, fun, addicting, and generally just really, really good. It's got online multiplayer planned, and unlike most other modern PC games, it also has splitscreen multiplayer available.I see that some people complain that the game's currently too hard, which is something I disagree with. Like most other racing games, the tracks themselves are bigger foes than your opponents. The difference being that this game, just like it's predecessors, kick this up a notch through a combination of neckbreaking speeds, tunnels, and obstacles that require skill, timing and precision to avoid in an efficient manner, but of course this becomes harder when the racers in front of you plant mines for you and the other competitors to hit, and the ones behind you fire various projectiles your way. It won't hold your hand, and nor should it. It'll be hard when you first start playing, sure, but this only ensures it being a satisfying experience once you've gained the skills required. I will admit that I find the game a bit too easy at the moment, if anything. In it's current state, the AI's pretty stupid and will do many mistakes, and the tracks themselves aren't particularly hard to master either (explained by the fact that only ""Easy"" and ""Medium"" difficulty tracks are currently available, with only one of the tracks being relatively finished). One thing to note however is that the controls currently in place adds some difficulty that wasn't present in the older games; the steering feels a bit clumsy and unresponsive, which is something I hope and think will get fixed fairly soon.  It's also got a really stable technical foundation, beautiful graphics, and great performance, I've tried it on different hardware ranging from a relatively ""low-end"" gaming system with an AMD A10 7850K coupled with an Nvidia GTX 560, and a ""higher-mid-end"" system with an Intel i5 4690K coupled with an Nvidia GTX 970, and it runs really well on both, with the latter system running it with max settings in 1920x1080 with ease, making it a gem compared to most other graphically advanced early access titles.The sound design is also really good, with satisfying 3D effects and feedback, albeit it's suffering from some glitches at the moment (certain explosions and bullet impacts sounding as if they're right next to you, even though they're happening at the other side of the track), but minor quirks like that are to be expected in such an early stage of development, and the developers are working on a fix. As long as you like Drum & Base, it's also got an absolutely killer soundtrack. The developers are perfect for this game, not only because some of them worked on the previous games, but also because they listen to and interact with the player base, not only on the Steam forums, but on their own forums as well, making sure reported problems get fixed, and popular suggestions get implemented.I think most of the success about this launch is thanks to the fact that these developers work out of passion. This whole thing started out of love for the original games, and even though their kickstarter campaign failed horribly due to a lack of attention, they still fought on and got it into a working state, as opposed to quite a lot of EA developers out to make a quick buck by catering to popular genres, and then more or less abandoning the project once a satisfiable amount of money has been made.Oh, and if everything goes according to plan, which I have no doubt it will, we will also get modding tools allowing players to create their own cars and tracks.So, TL;DR:+ Fun, addicting gameplay+ Splitscreen support+ Great sound design+ Amazing soundtrack (If you like DnB)+ The rare combination of good graphics and great performance+ Awesome developers that are actually passionate about their work and release good while listening to and interacting with the community (I.E how Early Access should work)+ IT'S ♥♥♥♥ING ROLLCAGE- The AI's currently a bit too easy/stupid- The steering's currently a bit unresponsive- Some minor glitches ",215,16,9,10,14,0,5

								Grip is a throwback to all the old classic 90's/early 00's arcade racing games.It will immediately remind you of rollcage. Not only does it play like rollcage. But it betters it. The developers hearts are well and truly in this one. They wanted to re-create the glory days of future arcade racers. And with each update comes great additions, and improvements. The game currently has 7 playable tracks. 16 in total is the aim for completion. 4 customizable vehicles classes.A great selection of power-ups.500mph+ speeds.A whole host of modes including an old school battle arena.Online multiplayer is coming soon.Local co-op works fine.Beautiful detailed tracks that keep getting things added to them with each update.A price that is honestly a steal for what you will get.And a dev team that reads all your comments and replies constantly on the steam forums as well as the grip site forums.Honestly, grip is the most fun I have had with an arcade racer in years. It's simply 'fun'. And very addictive. And with regular updates that are far from minimal. And a development team with a huge passion for these kinds of games, and communicate daily to their community..............what more could you want from an early access title?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								What is GRIP? to paraphrase the great 21st century singer Lionel Richie:""oh....what a feeling.....when you're driving on the ceiling""THE SHORT REVIEW:If you have fond memories of an old game called Rollcage then you will love this - it's pretty much the same game, by the same developers.THE LONG REVIEW:If you've never heard of Rollcage it will be tough to describe just how nuts this game is......1)   It's frighteningly fast racing2)   You can drive up walls....and on the ceiling.....3)   It doesn't matter whether your car flips over, and ends up upside down - it just keeps on driving4)   You can maneuver it in the air5)   As if dealing with defying gravity at speeds which will make your eyes bleed wasn't enough - you also have various                weapons to attack other drivers with. And they don't hesitate in using them on you......   Between the sexy graphics, blistering speed, intense sound effects, pumping electronic musica and general mayhem, it's enough to leave you feeling a bit woozy. At this point that's the only downer with GRIP - as much as it's sensory overload for your brain, it's also a little bit more than the camera can keep up with at times. However that can be easily fixed as the game develops. This is otherwise pretty polished for Early Access, though considering they previously developed two Rollcage games that's hardly surprising as this is, well, Rollcage in all but name.The content is a bit small at the moment, and online play isn't implemented yet, but the early signs are very encouraging. And it's super fun......but sick bags are not included with a purchase of the game. Now, if you'll excuse me - I need to lie down, as the room is spinning......			",473,127,14,37,10,0,48

								From the yearning of my childhood playing Rollcage and Rollcage Stage 2, comes this...THIS! Grip, made up of pretty much some big time vets that worked on the originals, they have created, just a small slice in EA, of that high speed, authentic future sci-fi combat racer along the likeless of Xtreme G Racing, F-ZERO days and to a lesser extent Wipeout. With 3 tracks currently, 1 playground and 2 arenas, it's only just launched publicly as I've been a part of private access for a little while now. With a handful of powerfups from miniguns, rockets, seeker rockets, mines, speed boosts and shields with many more to come, even the early combat is feelign strong. My play time doesn't quite factor in the full story as i've probably done about a 100 racers in this so far and wow.It stands on it's own from Rollcage even though it is very very like it (and that's a good thing) with the sounds of those powerful engines and the glorious high speed transmission whine which is a fantastic sound sample, one of the most enthralling I've heard in a while, this game is set up to be doing everything right.Created in UE4 (yes!) it's one of the first proper games to be coming using the power of this new engine, from the sensation of high speed which is getting better with each update, to the sounds and graphics and of course the physics, which is the most important aspect for a game like this, is on track feeling great.This review will be updated in time as more content is added but for now, it is a shining gem in a catagory on PC which all but forgotten. A scifi combat high speed racer that is featuring expansive tracks, a full career mode to come like RC1 and RC2, and brand new additions such as destructible environments (to what extent we yet not fully know), get this now and support a game that is shaping up to be one of the best of this year if the current communication with devs is anything to go by.Loved RC1/RC2 on PS1 and PC of the past? Love that high speed, combat racer feeling but in a UE4 game? Love that nostalgia from over 16 years ago? Then get it now, support the devs, and be in for a good time!***Last updated 02/02/2016***			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								are you the one responsible for melting the PS1 laser assembly after one too many hours of rollcage? if so, welcome back. rollcage veterans should have little trouble adapting to controls or handling. i've been driving like it was 1999 since the third race.9/10, because grip completely reeks of fresh, hot rollcage.

								Racing games have sucked lately, people seem to be focusing on realisim over actual fun. Gear switching n stuff like ugh who cares. It's about time we get a combat racer like burnout or vigilante 8.But GRIPOh gripJesus H ♥♥♥♥in Chrst GripI used to play a bit of rollcage on the PC and man was it fun. Find out that this GRIP game exists, and is made by the samedevs caught my eye.  And it's insane.I go in the game, and just FOOOM, SWOOSH, PEW PEW PEW, ALLUAH AKBAR ♥♥♥♥in ISIS WET DREAM IN DIS ♥♥♥♥♥. MAD MAX GOT ♥♥♥♥ ON THIS GAME. Racing even with the AI is both intense, fun, difficult and makes you want to play more. Ovbs this aint a game that you will spend your entire life on, but man is it fun.Although i do have a few comments, the steering is okay. It feels like it's a little resistant but not game breaking.Also hitting things are really painful not because you hit them, but because its a struggle to wiggle back into the race.Other than that no complaints, knowing the devotion of these people towards the project, the fairly frequent updates I have to say this is a E.A game that I was happy to put money into. If you want to fund a combat racer look no further. GRIP is one of those games that takes a simple premise and expands on it without it being too gimmicky and creating a skill curve that is fairly impressionable.			",33,1,1,2,1,0,0

Early Access Review
								My review is based on the following version: Pre-Alpha Early Access v1.0.6.0I haven't played all that much of the game yet, but what I've played was fantastic! First things first: GRIP definitely has the ""Early Access feel"" to it. There currently is only one proper vehicle (though in several color variations), there are not that many tracks yet, my controller doesn't work in the menus and it's a pain to change some settings like resolution. There are also some glitches and bugs I've experienced, plus the physics and collisions don't always feel on point. Yes, this is in Early Access and very much feels like it, so those of you who want an absolutely polished, content-rich game should probably wait out.Now on to the things GRIP has in store and already makes right - it is ridiculously fun and addictive! I never played the original Roll Cage, but I quickly fell in love with the concept. It's mad fun driving on the walls and on the ceiling and makes for a very dynamic gameplay. The controls, while a little tricky at first, feel tight. Just as tricky can be the car's behaviour on ramps and during landings playing it for the first time, but it's easy to get used to the physics. The sense of speed is in full effect, though it rarely feels like actually driving 400+ km/h ;) Still a fantastic feeling to drive past all opponents when the nitrous pickup kicks in! Speaking of pickups: The current selection of pickups offers the typical variants that I expect from such a car combat game. Nitrous, mines, shields, short-range miniguns as well as chasing rockets. Each pickup can help tremendously when used right, but also be wasted when the usage is timed badly. A great feature that compliments the pickup weapons well is the function to manually activate slow-motion. You can pull off very cinematic sequences with enemies losing control because of you shooting at him, causing him to drive up a rock, spinning uncontrollably in the air - all in awesome slo-mo! The game does a good job at presenting all the action that is caused by the sly tracks, by the use of pickups and by the AI drivers. I quite like all of the three AI presets that this game has to offer. But GRIP is tense even on the easiest difficulty, as a simple screwup or a well timed hit by an enemy in the last section of a track usually results in losing several spots.Let's talk about content, that is not too shabby considering the EA state. There are three game modes available that contain different maps and tracks. Race is my favorite and currently contains three tracks. Two of those are more or less finished as far as I can tell, with the third one being in an early work in progress state - still being lots of fun already though. Players have several options to setup the action on the tracks. Along with the difficulty setting there are options to disable pickups, to configure the number of laps (2,4 or 8) and the number of combatants (6,8 or 10). On top of that, the engine power can experimentally be raised and a catch-up assist can be enabled. I really like this option for a rubberbanding AI, as it can be easy to mess up and loose the opponents. This option helps catching up on the enemies to ensure a tense race. Arena has all the same options and sees all the combatants trying to damage and eventually frag each other. Once again, there are three levels ready, with one being an experimental early build. Both Arena and Race seem to ultimately get 12 tracks each, which I would be totally fine with. I'm having so much fun on every single one of the available maps that I'm sure that the others will be equally great. Next up is the mode Playground, that has the player collect some orbs spread across a huge, you guessed it, playground and just mess around with the vehicle and lots of ramps and walls. The devs apparently want this mode to have three playgrounds, with one already available. Greyed out for now is the Time Trial mode, which I guess will pretty much be Race without the opponents. Not there yet but hinted at already is ""Grip League"". As the devs want to add online functionality with a future update, I figure this will be a competititve online league. Lastly, there already is a splitscreen mode for two players in place with the same modes and options as in solo play, minus Playground. Great fun for some couch competitiveness, with four player splitscreen already announced as well. So all in all, I wouldn't call the content sparse, though it's also not packed with lots of vehicles and tracks...yet. The content as of today is solid for EA and there are many great things in prospect.The soundtrack consists of some great Drum'n'Bass tunes that fit amazingly well to the action and always get me pumped. Graphically, it looks pretty good. Even though the early version tracks might look a little barren, the game overall looks good in motion. I'd even call it pretty on the most barebone graphical settings. It has a decent amount of settings in this department, ranging from FXAA and TXAA as Anti-Aliasing solutions to object quality, effects, shadow, post process and texture quality settings. Playing on a R9 390, I5 6600K, 8GB RAM at 1440p, I use most settings at their highest choice and get a decent performance that sits well above 60 FPS for most of the time. I feel that the higher effects settings cost a lot of performance, so I leave that on Low and it still looks really good. Performance is pretty consistent, though the game might dip when lots of opponents are on screen next to explosions. With my slightly lowered settings, I keep the dips at a small pace though. Once again, considering the EA state, I'm impressed with both the looks and the performance.I absolutely love what I've played so far and immediately wanna get back into the combat madness! The main concept is brilliant and well executed. The content is okay-ish, with much more on the horizon though. There are some smaller issues that still scream ""Early Access"", but nothing that really comes in the way of having fun. If you are even slightly interested in what you are seeing and fine with content being gradually rolled out, go for it! Now! And thank me later :) ",305,115,12,29,42,4,19

								While still in early state GRIP is already a blast to play for a Rollcage fan. Arcade style combat racing with sick DnB soundtrack is all i could ask for and GRIP is all about that.At its current state its a good demo on what to expect from a full game and every update has been a great improvement from the last build. The developers are listening to peoples opinions on improving the game and the upcoming content. ",196,17,2,9,7,1,5

								First of all a Rollcage like game is here? I need it!I actually played some rounds in the game and i defently recommend it. It is an amazing game with good looking graphics thanks to Epic Games' Unreal Engine 4. The Cars look amazing and the speed is acutally there you feel like ""Holy Cow! Why am i so fast?"" or like ""Woooohooo speed baby!"" then the game is for you. So i hope you consider buying the game on steam and not on keyseller sites like ♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥ or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to directly support the dev team.			",217,28,28,20,18,6,26

I just wanted to support the game and pay for the early access. I look forward to more content and an eventual polish product.

								Remember Rollcage?This game is the successor to Rollcage, and was even made with the help of some of the original Rollcage devs.For those who never played Rollcage:GRIP is a fun arcade racer where your goal to simply go fast and win 1st place in a car similiar to those badass RC cars which could drive upside down and wish you had as a kid. In order to avoid momentum loss you can use the track itself to ROLL around (on tunnels, walls, in the air, and on map specefic contraptions), while managing to keep your tires on the ground (upside-down or vice-versa). Such a simple gimmic creats plenty of fun moments and creates a surprising difficulty curve for   those who love arcade racing.			",157,44,3,20,8,2,13

Early Access Review
								Grip is a very fast, futuristic combat racing game. With very nice looking graphics and nice soundtrack, the game can be an adrenaline rush. It’s a racing game where you can drive on walls and even the ceiling upside down. This takes racing to another level as you can use the terrain to your advantage. Combine that with weapons and power ups it’s a really nice game. It’s in early access at the moment so you can expect bugs and such.Graphics:The graphics looks absolutely gorgeous in this game. It runs on Unreal 4 engine so you can expect some nice graphics. The maps also look very themed, like the snowy track is dark and really feels like you’re racing in the snowy mountains. Plenty of option in the graphics menu as you can expect from any Unreal engine based game. I played the game on high settings (maximum is the EPIC setting.) and I was getting 40-60 FPS throughout.Sound:The music in this game is sort of a hybrid between techno and a little bit of metal thrown in. It’s very upbeat and fuels your adrenaline you get from the races. This sort of music is well suitable for a fast paced combat racing game. The good thing about music in this game is that you can individually select the tracks you like and turn the others off. There are a total of 10 tracks as of this review.Gameplay:At the moment you can only play 1 player or 2 player split screen. The split screen can be done horizontally or vertically. There is no campaign or multiplayer mode as of now but the developers are working on it. The car has huge wheels with the body in the middle so the wheels are sticking out on top and bottom, this means if the car even gets flipped upside down, you can keep going.There are many types of games you can play. Simple race, elimination, deathmatch, playground and time trial. All of these are pretty fun. Simple races are regular races where you have to complete a number of laps and whoever finishes first wins, if you get hit by enemy missiles or gun you will respawn. The Elimination is also like racing except when you eliminate someone they’re permanently out of the race. Deathmatch is a car arena where you have a certain number of combatants and you must go around collecting power-ups and trying to eliminate others. Last one standing wins the match. The playground is also arena with all sorts of tunnels, pipes, half-pipes and other obstacles and there are a certain number of collectibles you must pick up within the allotted time. The time trial is basically you trying to do the track in best time.You get pickups and you can hold 2 pickups at one time. The first one can be triggered using the shift while the second can be triggered by pressing the control key on the keyboard. These power ups include a machine gun, missiles and mines. There’s also the nitro boost speed power up and another protection power-up which sort of gives you armor at the back of your car so you can defend against machine gun or missiles attacks from behind. There’s a total of 2 racing tracks, 2 combat arenas and 1 playground map at the time of this review. The developers are working on more maps and more content. So keep an eye out for future updates which can make this game even better. A gameplay video of a race I did can be found below:

Graphics: 8/10Sound: 7/10Gameplay: 8/10Overall: 7/10Conclusion:The game has very fast paced adrenaline fueled combat racing.  Arcade type of racing with weapons combat. You can drive on walls, ceilings of tunnels, sides of the mountain basically any terrain. The camera will follow you no matter how many times you flip upside down inside of a tunnel, this makes it a very fun experience in my opinion. The game certainly has bugs and low FPS from what I could tell but it’s in early access, so the developers are ironing out the bugs hopefully. ",3607,1329,150,390,488,44,554

								-EDITED 29.3.2017!- Marked edited pros/cons with E. Having loads of fun with online MP!ROLLCAGE IS BACK!Copying my post from /r/grip:THE STATE OF THE GAME AS OF NOWHey guys,I suddenly stumbled upon Grip in the Steam store, and as an old Rollcage fan I was astounded. Is my childhood favourite making a return? YES! After watching videos and reading reviews I picked it up from Indiegala as they had a small sale.Even though it's early access and we all know how they usually go down in flames, this one has impressed me. I haven't had so much fun in a racing game in years. It's great! Really brings me back to the old Rollcage times, except Grip looks ASTONISHING and runs very, very smooth with my setup (i7-3770k&gtx970&144hz). There is quite a lot of content already, as there are several maps, cars and gamemodes available.So, after about 5 hours of gameplay I am putting together Pros and Cons, starting withPROS -Open and communicative devs E: Really, one of the developers played multiplayer with us!-Astounding graphics -Runs smooth, no lag or stutter -Basically Rollcage 2017 -The sense of speed is great -Driving is fun and rewarding -Gamepad support, later wheels -Physics work well for the cars that are ready E: New car is nice!-Several game modes included already -Interesting planets & fun tracks E: New ""Hard"" track is AMAZING!-Challenging AI (in races, not so much in Deathmatch) -Up to 10 AI in races is a plus -Some car customizing, more to come -A simple damage system already And the best for last..-PC SPLITSCREEN! At the moment for 2, later for 4! Whoooo!CONS -Splitscreen only functional with 2 gamepads at the moment! Keyboard+controller doesn't work yet -Soundtrack quite boring at the moment E: I have grown to like it, or just turn on spotify-Not so many weapons available yet -Online multiplayer isn't available anymore, coming back though E: It's back! SO MUCH FUN!-Story mode not available yet -Some gamemodes not available yet -Accelerating from a stop seems somewhy sluggish on all cars, but gets better after gaining speed. Not sure if intended. E: Physics improved, works again-Crashing to small obstacles and then just accelerating away is annoying. From 800kph to a small metal tube and poof, 0 kph. Maybe make a crash system instead of just stopping?-Cars should have some sort of spikes or something in the body to damage the car in the front and sides. Now it's just following and nudging a little. Maybe a part to purchase and customize? -Gravity seems too low sometimes, because if you bounce to the wrong direction from a rock or something, you are going to spend a lot of time in the air and land to the outskirts of the map, and resetting is always the best choice. -Not a ready game yet :[So there are my thoughts about the game for now. A really nice thing is that the devs are veterans and open to discussion in the forums and things get added and removed with the voice of the community in mind. It's great that they have a list on their website regarding what there is to come for the game. Looking forward to this game getting better and better, and I can already suggest trying the early access version. I am having fun with it!			",45,4,2,3,4,0,7

Im starting with: This is a good game.If you miss that rollcage times, Jack X or even Motor Storm, this is your game.Nice tracks, nice speed, good AI, some good graphics that a GT 740 2Gb can run and some epic moments that you will remember is what makes this game good. The atention to detail on the cars is high, and the effects are pretty.Some cons?-Some bugs. It's an early acces after all, but they dont bother that much.-The driving feels weird at first. You get used to it, but it is something to note.-Not so many maps at the moment. As I said, it's an early acces after all, but at this moment this is a con.-Sometimes, when on the air, the car can do weird ♥♥♥♥ like suddenly spin to a side. That usually happens when you crash with something.Other things to note is that they say that the multiplayer (currently at private branch) likes to crash. I played some games and i didn't had many problems, only cars shuttering sometimes.As I said, this game can be runned on a potato (a nice one, though) so don't worry if CanIRunit tells you that you can't run the game (unless if you have an Intel Graphics, wich I don't know why you do).Gameplay: 8/10Graphics: 10/10 they are still good on med-lowContent: 6.5/10Overall: 8/10PS: Im from Spain, sorry if I mess up the english sometimes.

Early Access Review
								Though GRIP is now more than a year old, I can recall only the vaguest memory of it before its current multiplayer iteration. And that is a great shame, since it’s quite a remarkable game. This week it’s my favorite (non-pinball) game, and that’s even including some wonderful racing/driving games. But it’s not perfect...(For this review, I consider SINGLE-PLAYER only. At least for now.)GRIP, as the Store Page indicates, is a futuristic racing game, taking place on other planets with a varied selection of technologically advanced vehicles. What really makes these “cars” stand out….they can’t land wrong! (Other than backwards.) Because of design, whatever side they land on is the bottom, and they can instantly GO!!!...reaching speeds of about 600 MPH (1,000 KPH.) Of course, at those speeds, steering requires some substantial degree of precision, and even a small bump (or impact) can send a car HUNDREDS of feet into the air........!What makes GRIP special? You don’t have to be a great driver-gamer to have fun, or even to do well. While an experienced driver will certainly have an edge (especially with “newbie buttons” turned off), unlike most racing games, any player should outright WIN some percentage of races. And there’s even a “bail-out” button; holding the “respawn” button will get you back in the race with little time or distance lost, almost no matter the situation you may be in.GRIP is hard to explain. The vehicles basically “stick” to the track, so players will often find themselves traveling at high speeds……completely upside down. And that's often not obvious until something goes wrong, and gravity instantly takes control.The GRIP tracks are beautifully designed for functionality, as well as appearance. The Store Page trailers and screenshots say more than my words can begin to express (so I won’t try, except to say that what they add to the game can’t be measured.) Most tracks offer shortcuts that may offer an advantage….. if you dare! I expect to still be discovering new nooks and crannies for quite some time.The GRIP cars offer features very specific to players’ driving styles. Fortunately, I quickly found a car that suits beginning drivers (such as myself); slower, but with maximum control (and at average speeds of 250 – 300 MPH, good to have.) None of the cars are locked (and in fact, nothing in GRIP is locked at this point.) But none of the cars can be upgraded either. Yes, their color and rims can be changed (yawn), as can the tires. But does a tire change alter performance? Hard to say, and GRIP isn’t talking (that I could find.)The GRIP game modes are pretty standard. Simple racing (yet with weapons. Strange.....), battle racing, elimination racing and best time with one player only. For beginners, I’d strongly suggest the time trials. Being on the course alone is the best way to learn the tracks. (Although just being thrown unto an unknown track with nine other racers has a certain undeniable, desperate charm as well!) There are also two Deathmatch arenas and something referred to as “Carkour” that one presumes to be a form of car parkour. I have little experience with either.While GRIP’s best features speak for themselves (and LOUDLY so!), there are some less fortunate aspects that should be noted:While the tracks available are great, there aren’t very many of them, and almost half of them are simply reversals.Almost everything about each race is GREAT! But then what? There is no type of progression (at least for single player.) Presumably, much of the reason is that there are so many variables, possibilities and options, it would be difficult to create a standardized system of progression. Yet, it takes much out of the game (in this player’s opinion) to go nowhere. For example, currently in battle races, the final scoreboard has to wait for all racers to complete to finish calculating (even if you're last), which often never happens, no matter how long one waits. But the player soon realizes; So what if there’s no final score posted? It would serve no purpose in GRIP’s current form.Pickups are basically a “learn as you go” process, as well as studying the controller settings to try to understand how to use them. There’s nothing even remotely like a tutorial, and that would be VERY helpful (at least for beginners.) Which is a weapon? Which is a tool? What do the symbols mean? How do you use them?GRIP’s battle system is weak. Some weapons have little purpose, are badly utilized by the controller, and come with no explanation. (In fact, the only difference between the regular race and battle race is the final scoring method. This seems inexcusable.) The notification of points scored is almost meaningless. (Who did what, and to whom? Green text? Red text? Which name first…or second?)Personally, I find techno music lacks the sort of heart-pounding intensity I would choose for such immersive racing, but players have the option to race to their own music as well.The cameras can behave unpredictably, especially if you happen to get turned around, or are involved in a collision. And more camera choices really need to be considered.Best scores aren't stored. What's your best time on time trials? Your best Battle race score on a certain track? Once you leave that mode, it's gone forever.While GRIP has many changes to consider (some of which will be dealbreakers for many gamers), it’s still a fun game with lots of potential at a reasonable price. If these changes are made, this could be a top tier game. Otherwise, it’s still a fun game, just not with the power to keep most players’ attention for an extended period of time. (NOT written as a criticism, simply as an observation of a VERY competitive genre I've spent a respectable amount of time in.)Thank you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Aight so I know all the jokes surrounding games on Early Access, BUT MY GOD, if you ever were or still are a fan of combat racers, you ABSOLUTELY need to play and follow this game, cause it can bring the genre back into its former popularity. The game is only in pre-alpha (only 6 tracks currently, most of which are still under construction), but that alone is already more than just a proof of concept. The fun of GRIP is %50 competition, %50 sensory experience. I prefer to focus on the latter in this review, as I'm sure plenty others will make it a point to address performance/controls/UI (which aren't too shabby imo).So, GRIP manages to create that rush of high-octane chaos when you launch out of the finish line and you and the other racers are funneled into that first tunnel section; where the boys get sorted from the men. You truly feel the sense of speed as dilapidated sections of blast doors and support columns whip passed you. You feel the weight of your tremendous battle wagon, HAULIN' it down the track. You feel the GRIP of your monstrous tires claw at the ceiling and walls as you ride them like a damn maniac. It is all just that wondrous combination of STEEL and FIRE and GRIT, all going 10fold faster than what you ever thought possible. I hadn't felt these things in a long time, until GRIP ♥♥♥♥ING RIPPED THEM OUT OF ME.And this is just what the early access pre-alpha dishes out...So please, pick up this game on early access to support these awesome guys at Caged Element, and give them your feedback if you do, cause they're always looking for input from players on the forum regarding game mechanics, vehicle and track design, etc. We can bring combat racing back.tl;dr: WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? GET A GRIP, AND GET GRIP.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I recommend this game for everyone, especially those who played Rollcage in their childhood, whether it was on PC or PlayStation 1.This game as it is stated for now, is still in early access, but don't back off yet. It's not just an ordinary unfinished product with lazy developers who will leave it unfinished. Community on forum and steam group is alive as any other. Developers always talk to us and gives constant updates on the situation. There are already tons of topics and ideas for upcoming content and If you like racing games such as Motorstorm: Apocalypse, Wipeout or even F-Zero. You will definitely like this one. About graphics, It Runs on Unreal Engine 4 and it looks very beautiful (it looks like an AAA title)This game is constantly under development, the career mode with story will be added later, the physics of cars will change and full version will have connection with workshop. You will be able to import your own content into the game. (hopefully)There is lot more to talk about, but basically this is what is GRiP as for today. Be patient though, as it will get only better, and I can fully recommend this game from bottom of my heart. Community and developers are kind, and the game is really there with each update. Spiritual successor at its finest.			",55,10,11,0,3,1,0

								I want to like this game. It has such potential. There's a lot of things to love about this game. But I have a few fundamental problems with it1. I am stuck playing against bots. There is no online multiplayer atm. This is a massive disappointment to me.2. The physics feel off. The cars lose GRIP after hitting the tiniest inconceivable pebble in the road, and sometimes it feels quite arbitrary. The cars seem to be too light in general.3. Lack of control mid-air (like Rocket League, kind of)4. Cars drive at awesome speeds, but the handling feels slugging for such a fast paced game. ----I would probably change my review to Positive if they adressed my first point only.edit: change to positive because the game has a multipålayer. The MP experience could be a lot better but it's WIP I guess			",344,60,17,38,18,7,63

Early Access Review
								This game is everything I loved about Rollcage.  It doesn't try to be realistic or modern in any way  and despite being currently in Alpha, it runs smoothly on my high end PC and on my average Joe laptop.  The pumping drum and bass, meaty machine guns and beefy explosions are a welcome assault on my ears, leaving the crisp (and sometimes quite trippy) graphics to take care of the visuals and turn my stomache.And you are guarunteed a few tummy lurchers.  What stood out in Rollcage, was the multi dimensional nature of the gameplay.  Sure, you can stick to the ground in an attempt to indulge in a casual Sunday drive... but why would you when you can pick up a rocket, drive 90 degrees around a banked turn, fire your rocket down on a player on the ground, jump from the vertical bank into a narrow pipe, throw up a little as you lose all sense of direction, fly out the pipe upside-down landing perfectly.As far as content is concerned, there is just enough to wet the appetite of anyone who took the plunge into the realm of early access.  I completed everything available (bar multiplayer) a couple of times in just under an hour but I'm planning to convice a few friends to pick it up to tackle the multiplayer side.Thoroughly looking forward to the development of this title!

								Great game with a promising future, and for the price you pay (which warrant you a continuous stream of contents still yet to come, including multiplayer), it will probably get you busy for a little while. It's still in early access, so by any means don't expect a finished product, but what we have here is top notch. It's a fresh take on an old time favorite, (best suited for fans of fast paced arcade racers (think Wipeout, F-Zero, Dethkarz and the like)). A must-have for any Rollcage fan out there. Go pick it up before the price raise. I highly recommend this game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
Portable DescriptionGRIP is a battle racing game with a style reminiscent of similar combat racers released near the turn of the century, most notably Rollcage. With beautiful visuals and a heart-pumping soundtrack, GRIP is a fantastic way to release any pent up destructive tendencies. Note: GRIP is still in Early Access. There is currently no online multiplayer or campaign mode as of yet, but the game is still extremely promising. GameplayGame ModesGRIP can be played either solo, or with a local coop buddy. There is currently no multiplayer/campaign yet. To start a match, you must first choose a game mode, then a planet and track/arena. There are 8 different maps, some are WIP, available for play at the moment with a few tracks that are mode-exclusive. Each game mode can be customized by changing various settings, such as: No. of laps/combatants, difficulty, reversed/mirrored tracks, etc. The included game modes are:RacesEliminationDeathmatchPlaygroundTime TrialItem PickupsPickup platforms are placed throughout the levels which provide the player with weapons or powerups, such as:Raptor: high-impact machine gun.Scorpion: homing missile that targets the opponent in front of you.Assassin: tracking missile that targets the current opponent in 1st place.Quaker: proximity mine.Aegis: rear-facing shield.Firestorm: turbo-boost.EMP: EMP that shuts down opponents' engines.

 ControlsHandlingGRIP's vehicular handling is not as tight as a kart racer, nor is it as realistic as a racing sim (for obvious reasons). The cars seem to be designed to go airborne, careen out of control or switch perspectives very often as you are essentially controlling an RC flip car. Although the handling is perfectly acceptable if these are the design intentions, controlling the cars are not as fluid as I had hoped. The developers are aware of this and the collision physics are a WIP. A couple suggestions that may help improve handling experience are listed below, however, I understand it may be very difficult to actually incorporate them. Increasing the vehicle’s weight, or sense of one. Reducing the reliance of releasing the accelerator to improve control; allow for strict handbrake control at full acceleration.PresentationArt & Sound DesignGRIP's visuals are truly magnificent. The tracks are extremely varied from each other with regards to level design, aesthetics, and environments. The different biomes you can race or battle through can be extremely luscious, barren or frigid; however, what remains the same is that the graphics are so good that they can sometimes distract you from the main objective. The accompanying EDM and fast-tempo soundtrack also does a fantastic job keeping you focused and immersed while providing a sense of speed and adrenaline rush.ConclusionEarly AccessFor those that are not aware of the Early Access concept, it is perfectly acceptable for bugs to be present (only minor ones observed) and game mechanics to be missing. According to the Early Access notes:The full version of GRIP will have 12 cars (3 classes), 16 tracks (4 planets), 10 pickups, career mode, arcade mode, arena mode (with arenas), precision mode (with a few tracks), multiplayer (online or local LAN and split-screen), mod tools for custom cars, and (depending on funding moving forward) a track editor so players can build their own courses. Our goal is to have the ""final"" version of GRIP by the end of 2016, though with the right support GRIP will never be final, as we hope to be adding new cars, tracks and possibly pick-ups well into 2017. The developers have shown interest in maintaining GRIP’s balance and development progression as seen in the major monthly patch notes here, and active responses in the Discussions board.VerdictGRIP is an extremely promising, albeit limited-content, combat racer/arena battler. With its impressive visuals, level design and combat mechanics, I can easily recommend this game to battle racing/arena fans; however, it is understandable to want to wait until the game releases career/multiplayer modes (local coop is already supported). For those that pick-up the game right now, understand that you have the power to help guide the developers with their balancing tweaks and feedback suggestions. They are very receptive and seem to incorporate player responses fairly well. Review copy provided by Caged Element Inc. ",857,336,42,86,70,12,108

Early Access Review
								GRIP is fast, furious, fun. Racing in the same league as the likes of Rollcage, F-Zero and Wipeout, GRIP brings futuristic combat racing bang up-to-date.Unlike in F-Zero and Wipeout, your racecraft sits on four wheels (most of the time), but you can ride up the walls and onto the ceilings of tunnels. The brilliantly designed courses go from narrow winding corridors into wide open spaces that encourage the daring racer to take shortcuts to attain first place. Much like in the aforementioned games there are plenty of pick-ups to grab. Speed boosts, machine guns and rockets litter the course allowing you to gain a timely advantage over your opponents. I love how intense the racing is in this game. Everything can change in a split-second, which is very exciting.Apart from the standard races and time trials, at time of writing you also get access to 'arena' mode which throws you into a battleground against a number of opponents in a last-man-standing fight to the finish. 'Playground' rounds off the game modes in the current build, which challenges you to find all of the pick-ups on an elaborate testing ground. Even in early access GRIP provides lots to keep you occupied.Graphically, GRIP looks and sounds great. The maps are vibrant, the craft are colourful, it just looks nice. The soundtrack is the kind of techno that we've heard in other future-racers, and might not be to everyone's taste but the music's not overbearing and fits the theme nicely.Even in its current early early-access stage GRIP is shaping up very well, and might very well end up being a modern day contender to the brilliant futuristic combat racers of old. Here's a gameplay video:

								This is the follow up to the cult post-Wipeout racing game ""Rollcage"". The developers carry the passion to create a fast arcade game with the sensibilities of the end of 90's Psx era, but in beautifully Unreal Engine 4 rendered graphics. Even though in early access they keep adding new features, cars, tracks, game modes, and gameplay/physics tweaks, according to player feedback as well, so I'm happy to say this looks like a classic in the making, and that if any of these things tickle your fancy you will not be disappointed and should support the developers (Caged Element).

Early Access Review
It's a modern take on a crazy old school racer.Let's make one thing straight from the start. It's not Rollcage 3. It's a lot more than that :DEven at an early access state (highly pre-alpha), the game runs solid like stone. Even with the horrendous streak that nVidia has with their drivers, this game is yet to crash a single time for me. On top of that it runs smooth and utilises my favourite form of anti-aliasing, the TXAA. Optimisation is great and the Unreal Engine 4 powering this game seems like a magnificent choice given that the game graphical wise looks amazing retaining that Rollcage feel to it.Technical stuff aside, the gameplay is highly reminiscent of... yet again, Rollcage series. It's a spiritual successor after all, made by people who were also a part of the team that was responsible for the Rollcage series. You have an actual wallriding, not wall-welding known from Need For Sales, ceiling riding as well, a selection of weapons that that allow you to give out tickets to the moon in a disturbingly fast pace and even a pure deathmatch mode aka destruction derby, just with more... weapons and explosions. That said, if you don't like weapons, you can disable them and stick to pure racing.Early Access experience is... quite different. I've been a part of DiRT Rally Early Access which has an opinion of being one of the best so far on Steam ever, but let me tell you... those guys here are something else. They really take their time to post on the forums trying to explain the issues, inform and (here's the part that is just unbelievable) apologise for any and all breaks and lacks of activity that may occur.Aside from having great communication and actually implementing ideas and fixes (I mentioned a fix for a part of track, few days later it was implemented) they share their views and often discuss some of the more interesting topics. They're not afraid to ask for feedback on the forums but also can straight out say ""we won't do it"", which shows they have a vision for the game and don't want to just put everything there is into the game, which would most likely create a boring mess.Quite honestly, those guys put DiRT Rally early access to a shame. And that says a lot.Given that the game is still in Early Access, there's not that much content. Dev team is small (only one person responsible for entirety of physics!) so they're unable to pomp out a lot of content, however it's coming and nothing is being missed. If they say something is coming, then it is. Multiplayer is next, so... :DIf you're one of those that understand that realism can only be fully applied to things of past and present and not future (thus the term ""futuristic"" exist) and love some good ol' proper arcade racer, then this game is for you.TL;DR;- spiritual successor to Rollcage series, but gives option to not use weapons- technical side of the game is impeccable- puts DiRT Rally early access to a shame- content comes out irregularly but solidly, nothing gets missed			",53,8,12,19,5,1,11

Early Access Review
								Oh my goodness. I don't know what to say! I bought this game, having entirely missed that it's in Early Access, and STILL found myself grinning ear-to-ear and laughing - with no one else around - at how tremendously silly and fun this game is! What a gem! I can't wait for it to be completed. I never played the games it's based on, either, so nostalgia is not a factor, here.As for the mechanics, the racing is glorious and smooth. If you see a smooth surface, you can drive on it...and ramp off of it, transfer to the ceiling of a tunnel, stay stuck to it somehow, come rocketing our the other end, land upside-down onm a wall, and keep going. The game also clearly tells you when a feature isn't quite ready for primetime: there's a work-in-progress map in the game, multiplayer is present but incomplete, menu navigation is limited to mouse input in parts...and I know everything is working as currently intended because the game is actually upfront with what's being worked on.On top of that there are options I don't normally expect to see in cheap racing games (or, in fact, *any* arcade racing games). The HUD has a visibility slider, you can adjust the FOV up to basically fisheye levels, you can disable certain crash effects - although honestly the crash effects on the HUD are so mental that I love them, you can toggle slow-mo in a race by hitting Select on the controller, there are several types of game modes with multiple different types of tracks and arenas to accomodate them.I'm sure there are issues, and I've only played for an hour or so, but I have been enjoying the game so much that I had to close out and give it a hearty recommendation.

								Spiritual sequel to Rollcage and Rollcage Stage 2.Review updated 6/4/17:A solid ammount of content has been added since the early days of early access to turn this into a very solid game in the Rollcage lineage. The somewhat aenemic lineup of cars and tracks has been filled out with more to come. The physics have greatly improved and the cars are far less prone to floating about when you ramp off obstacles within the circuits. Track detail is excellent and the art is great all around. Grip looks terrific with nice sound effects and a very good neurofunk style soundtrack.The price is right and the devs have been updating the game regularly, if you ever played the original Rollcage games and enjoyed them or have enjoyed more current combat racing games like Blur or Split/Second you should definitly pick it up.

								What a blast from the past! I loved Rollcage from back in the day, and this game nails it as a clone or spiritual successor! It's still very early in development, but even from the get go (I bought on day one on their website,) one could easily see this game has good direction and great potential for having fun just like the Rollcage days. Todays update (29/01/16) has only solidified the direction with an enhanced UI, better responsiveness, split-screen and some more great drum and bass tracks! I can see me and friends sinking hours into split screen. And even more into the online component when thats ready.The game also runs great @ 1440p + 144hz using a 980 ti and an i7 4770k, I maintained 100 fps easily at max settings and the game looks very nice already. The game has perfect controller support too. The game uses the UE4 engine.Grip is being made with some of the old Rollcage developers/team and i can't wait to see what they do next with the game in future updates, which so far have been frequent and awesome.Recorded time doesn't account for actual time played. Will update as the game evolves.			",342,43,15,50,45,4,56

								--- Early Access Review ---I was just bored, searching the steam store for some new release. There was like nothing interesting, until something caught my eye. ""Wait is that new rollcage?"" My childhood game where i spent hours playing by myself and with friends. I MUST HAVE IT! - without thinking i bought this 5 minutes after finding it, not knowing almost anything about current playability. I did not regret it.And here i am, experiencing this amazing racing game greatly inspired by Rollcage series which is more than 15 years old. Racing through apocalyptic world of weaponized cars, which simply cant end up on their roof... kinda... Prepare to be competing in a fast-paced races full of adrenaline, pickups and explosions. Get your weapons ready, its time to put on your racing pants and join the world of GRIP !Game Currently Contains:- 7 Playable maps (including mirrored and reverse mode for each)- 4 Different Cars- 1 Arena Mode with 2 maps |Expected: 3 arena modes|- Carkour Mode with few maps = short obstacle courses- Basic car customizationWhat to know before buying:- Online Multiplayer is planned in a close future (currently available in beta branch)- Very occasionaly game may crash (no longer the case for me after latest updates)- Split Screen is currently only available with 2 controllers only (Controller + Keyboard doesnt work yet)Note: You may still play this on your keyboard in single player- Developers are very open to feedback and suggestion on their official forum site.- They plan to add few more maps and vehicles, additional gamemodes, some more pick-ups and... possibly workshop and level editor in the later stage?- Updates about once a month(Will be updating the review as the content is released)Highly recommending so far :)			",99,16,9,6,4,2,19

Announcement: GRIP update 1.0.8 is now live! 
GRIP, Mar 12, 2016

			- GRIP Early Access Release v.1.0.8 is now live! - Another big patch that has plenty of improvements and additions! http://www.cagedelement.com/grip/temp/Patch108.jpg The biggest changes include a...		


As such, i will update this review.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So far, i am loving this game despite playing it only for a few minutes. I haven't been this into a racing game in a long time! GRIP is basically a spiritual successor to the popular PS1 and PC classic ""Rollcage"" (both 1 and 2). If you don't know what Rollcage is, watch this video:

Pros:+ Beautiful Graphics (Once again, Unreal Engine 4)+ Runs very well at a constant 60fps with Vsync on at max settings in 1080p (Specs are on my profile)+ It's fast, intense, engaging, and consistant. This game FLOWS like no other racer i've played before!+ Weapon Pickups (This is a combat racer after all)+ Well done track designs, which offer you some shortcuts to either get ahead, or stay ahead of the game+ Splitscreen multiplayer. Again, we need more devs to start including this in their games. NOT EVERYTHING HAS TO BE ONLINE ONLY PEOPLE! + Playground mode, which is essentialy a free roam mode+ Time trial mode (I'm sure you know what this is by now)+ The floaty controls have been bettered in this new update. Cars drive much nicer now! As a result, i have now moved this to the pros.Cons:- Cars STILL bounce easily on even the smallest things. This can also be a bit annoying at first, but it can be funny when you manage to tumble into everyone causing them to tumble and bounce around with you XD- Still no mid-air control. You cannot steer yourself in the air like most other racers let you do, which can at times get ridiculous when you just cannot stop running into things and bouncing around everywhere- Arena mode is kinda lacking, but then again this game doesn't have too much to offer at the moment. I'm not surprised, but maybe this'll be more fun with a friend or friends. All you do in this mode is just drive around collecting weapon pickups to destroy all the enemy vehicles.If they can give us the ability to steer ourselfs mid-flight like a majestic eagle, then this game would be even better! Do i recommend this game?The answer: OH HELL YEAH! Go buy the game right now, the devs can really use the money to continue supporting and updating the game with new tracks and more! I'll update this review as i play more of it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								----Original Review at Bottom---Alright so it seems my review oddly got a small amount of attention. I'm not really a super awesome curator review person, but, since it's had some attention I'll update it to be a bit more proper using Pro's and Con'sPro's:Visuals are fantasticIMO the game feels kind of immersive due to way the screen has a visual effect at higher speedsCombat is well done without being overpowering, and if thats not your sort of thing you can disable pickups and use classic race mode where position determins a win.The maps are varried accross different planets, each with a different enviroment.The multiplayer is good and works. I don't have a lot of play time, but, I played several matches in arena and racing, and I didn't encounter any issues. Abliet the voting system did just recieve a patch.Cons:Some of the maps can be quite difficult but are still a WIP. I played the WIP Sky track map today and found it somewhat difficult to get back in 1st after getting hit by a rocket on an upside down portion of the track which leads me to my next conThe Reset mechanic. It can be a bit squarilly at times, and is best invoked yourself rather than letting it do it itself. And even then, when you are reset on an upside down portion of the track, it can be very hard to get enough speed back up to not fall again to get reset again. Try and aim for a green turbo arrow on the track right away when your reset if in this situation, if there are any.------So, thats a bit of an update to the review, yes I know it's not the best review, but, I have a huge backlog of games and ADHD so it's a bit hard at times for me to keep track of it all. If this review keeps getting attention, I'll try to update it as I play more. TLDR; It's a great remake of an older game with a pretty unique style of racing. I'd buy again.Original Review: WOW. JUST WOW! I have played only 3 races and I am BLOWN AWAY! If you have ever played Rollcage GET THIS GAME! If you have never played anything like this, GET THIS GAME! GET IT RIGHT NOW! You will not be dissapointed. I actually felt like I was screaming down the track at 400+ KPH a couple of times. It's amazing. I love this game. GET IT!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								As an early backer, I got this game a while ago and didn't play much of it as it was one track and needed a lot of work. However, It was super fun to play. (I love it when you go through tunnels upside down) I am glad it's finally made it to Early access, and I sincerely hope the developers finish the game they envisaged when it announced on Kick Starter.So yes, buy it. Support it. And help them finish it.			",96,39,0,11,6,2,10

								I've been an early access supporter of grip for a few months now, and so far I've been having a blast with this game. I've loved racing games for a long time and even though Grip is in early development, it is my favorite racing game because the core gameplay is amazing and the game has tons of potential for a rich story, lots of cusomization, awesome maps, new cars, weapons, and an epic online mode that will come a little later in development. For 16 euro I find it well worth it :)			",83,2,2,5,5,2,4

								Before I even put my opinion out there, I want to give a shout out to FailRace for introducing me to this game in one of his videos.  Remember those RC cars that could flip over and keep going without issue?  Someone thought ""hey let's make a racing game out of this"".  Combine some aspects of Mario Kart, F-Zero and Distance, and you got a great game in your hands.  I have only a few gripes about this, but considering how early it is in development, I can let them slide.*Air control isn't fast enough.  Not only that, it's really loose and any momentum will make it hard to readjust.*The tunnels can be disorienting and aren't very stable to drive through at times.  This is more significant in the smaller ones, like on the first track of the first planet.*It is way too easy to get out of bounds and fall into the void.*I've had some problems with the front of my car clipping into a wall in the playground area, often getting stuck with no way to reset except to restart the entire session.

Early Access Review
								Ladies and Gentlemen, follow this game, thats how Early Access is done.The game runs amazingly well on my potato, its gameplay is fast and objective, just press your arrow keys (or analogs) and you will be good to go!No really, this really captures the look and feel of Rollcage and places it on a modern engine, everything feels enjoyable just like the old game, the powerups are extremely useful not only for you, but for the AI aswell (careful, they drive just as good as you, so don't be so confident you will always come in first place), gameplay is FAST, like, REALLY fast, be careful to not spin your car on those closed turns and tight places.Keep up the pace! The game is well shaped for early access and if it keeps going like that, it will be a huge hit.(Now tell me other game developer team [you know who you are and what game you made], if those guys could do a good remake, both visually and technically, why couldn't you?)

								The sense of speed is nuts...even at 4k. Even though inspired by Rollcage - POD, Wipeout and Crash & Burn (3DO) fans will find something special here. As an EAG, it's not complete, but what's here so far is terrific. The presentation and sound of missles in this game something special. Nice job. More tracks please.			",500,41,49,38,61,6,64

Early Access Review
								Pre-emptive review (will be updated/changed before/on game release):- its on UE4 , looks great, sounds great. The style and atmosphere is top notch imho.- the gameplay is ..kinda insane. car combat on 400-700+ km/h (300-400+ mph)+ speeds..- ride on walls and ceilings, nothing should stop a speed demon.- very fun if you don't fear death or epilepsy. Feels like Neo Tokyo racing scene at times.- Great to play sober and not... (I consider it a bonus) Just don't expect to win at that point. - different weapon pickups aswell as boost/shield pickups and more. - Boost pads on tracks to keep your momentum going if you can handle it.- different Game modes (more Combat or Speed/final placement focused racing, Arena, Sudden Death etc.), options to choose from (Reverse track!/Mirror Track!/ CatchUp/Laps/Destructible cars etc.)- selection of planets, each containing varried tracks for racing with alternate paths to take on and master each of them.- its raw, it will neeed more development time to go and all that... and who knows what will be added/changed.- It got 4 cars at the moment each with its own character, with color/rims/tires customisation. Naturaly, all of them are insane in their own right, depends on how you like your endorphin delivered.- multiplayer is in early development/test stage. Split screen available !- hard to learn, harder to master. - begs for a steering wheel/joystick to get the maximum control of your own death...when the speed gets to 600+ km/h- You can already feel like Yuri Gagarin. We have a Lift Off.Yes I do recommend this game, I would recommend to have your eye on it (or both), await for it's release or get involved in alpha.especialy if you like 400-700+ km/h speeds, electronic music, adrenaline, hi-tech/futuristic/sci-fi/ car combat racing on jets with wheels, ..and if you can handle it and want to handle it.It took me some time to get into it, to learn the handling (the game is still changed/developed so..) but now I do enjoy coming back to it for a few races, to get my junky speed fix.

The game also looks and runs really good, even on the tracks marked as a work in progress, which was a surprise.If you love insanely high speed combat racing then you owe it to yourself to get this game.

								Totally bought this out of nostalgia for Rollcage Stage 2, was not disappointed.  I haven't played enough to spot any bugs yet, but I already fell in love with it in the short time I have played.  I'm looking forward to future updates and online multiplayer!Pros+Tight racing controls (once you get a feel for it)+Gorgeous environments+Sick cars and customizations+Good amount of content for early access+Fast paced+Fun and not too infuriating (Although the AI tends to place mines in the most annoying places)Cons-No online multiplayer yet-Not a lot of cars (theres 3 but the current customization makes up for that at the moment)-The options are kinda odd, took me a little while to realize X button was drift since it was labelled ""Pad Face Left""-I can only use the mouse to cycle through menus-Not many power ups-No tutorial (or at least I havent found one)If you like combat racers or the old Rollcage games from PS1 days, then you're gonna love this game.

								WOW! A beautiful racing game with weapons on the unreal 4 engine? SIGN ME UP! This game is fantastic fun even in its early access stages. I jumped on board early so I could get a cheaper price after my kickstarter pledge was canceled when it failed. I want these Devs to have my money to continue adding more stuff. Let me say, this game is HARD. Even on slowest speed and easiest AI. That is part of why I'm so drawn to it.  Having a game where you can pull off some super epic stuff with an insane skill level is awesome. The splitscreen is just an added bonus. I will update my review as the game gets updated, but this review was written on the very first version, and even at this stage its worth a purchase!			",912,138,59,85,56,7,110

Early Access Review
								GRIP is a super speed racing game in the spirit of the Rollcage games (and the devs of it).Although the game is in early access, it feels very good gameplay-wise. Driving at 500 km/h (or up to 700 km/h!) feels awesome. Controlling the car properly gives enormous satisfaction. When you nail that curve, coming at it 500 km/h, ease off the gas a little to gain better control, dodge that mine in last second only to see that the guy coming behind you hits it, it feels pretty awesome. Or when you see and hear the guy behind you starts his gattler at you, you deploy your back shield to show a middle finger at him, then drop a mine in a tight tunnel and look back as your enemy drives right into it, exploding (then you drive against a wall because of looking back but that is beside the point).GRIP feels very good. This feeling comes from great soundtrack, gorgeous looking tracks and ofc the racing itself. Sound effects are top notch, for example everytime you fire the gattling gun it feels like it has some serious power. The low ""chuckchuckchuck"" sound of the gun, the swirling sound of the gattler ""swrrrrrr"", and the sound when it hits your metal enemy ""chingchingching"". You send your enemy veering and take the leader position. Soon after that you hear a beeb thats increasing its frequency, and realize a missile is coming to you! Quickly, you manouver to a power up hoping it would give you a shield. No shield? Tough luck. You look back and see a guy coming right after you. You let off the gas and brake just a little, to give that guy the first place. Soon after that the missile hits the guy infront (BOOM) of you sending him flying wildly all over the place, and you take the leader position again. All this while the crunchy drum and bass music plays in the backround to raise your pulse just the right amount. The driving itself is great. At first it feels like the car bounces too easily off the little bumbs etc, but you soon learn the use of braking and letting off the gas pedal dramatically increases your control. For example, you see ahead a little hill that you are going to take air from. If you go to that jump with full throttle and you are not driving 100% straight to it, you are gonna bounce wildly all over. Instead, you must ease off the gas a little, and make a little correctional driving manouvers so that you jump so that your car doesn't go all over but instead does a neat little controlled jump. Remember that you are driving 500 km/h, at that speed a little bumb or hill must be taken seriously. This makes the driving feel really good, you feel like you are in total control of your car, and if you get distracted you will be punished for that. It feels like you are on the edge all the time, even a small mistake can make you fly and spin. You cannot go full throttle and hit the walls in curves, like in some arcade racing games. Even if the game is really awesome, early access means very limited content though. Patches have been regular. I will remind you, dear reader, that if you want a full game experience with proper amount of content, wait longer. If, however, you can't wait to give these metal beast a run, enjoy awesome drum and bass music and wish to support this badass racing game, buy it now! Remember that buying the game now secures that it will come a finished product, and it already offers many hours of crazy speed driving goodness. I normally feel very sceptical about EA games, but this one I had to give a go and I am super glad I did!			",160,16,9,11,7,2,1

								Really fun futuristic combat racer.This is the spiritual successor to Rollcage from the PS1 circa 1999.It plays just like i remember rollcage playing.Its great to see these types of racers making a comeback instead of the endless sim racing games that companies have been pumping out over the last 5+ years.If you wanna see some gameplay you can check my video here.

								Prepare your ♥♥♥♥ because that game will ♥♥♥♥ your ♥♥♥ and won`t even pay for it!It`s a must buy for every oldschool racer lover. You have to be the dankest danker that ever danked to play this. BELIEVE ME.You have to be atleast 420Blazeit360Noscoper to even being close to first place.Nah but for real. This game is Dark Souls of combat racers, you have to throw out through the window everything you knew about racing, To win a race you have to know 100% of the track, and be 200% precise, even one accident will ♥♥♥♥ up your whole race.Music fits really well with the game and fast pace, additional props for having two of original composers from Rollcage: Stage IIPlanets look gorgeous, and tracks are well thought, there are many secrets on pretty much every track.I give this Game 420BlazeIt/360NoscopeWould dank again.After alot of updates, this game became even better, first implementation of multiplayer is nearly perfect for a p2p connection, new design of the cars is gorgeous, new tracks are fun, and customization is really well made although a bit unfinished.

Early Access Review
								Grip is a hardcore futuristic combat racing game that is not for the faint of heart. Grip stands out from the very few combat racing game that are out there by focusing on high speed a little more than the combat but the combat isn't overshadowed. The cars are the star of the show featuring the ability to flip over and to continue driving. The cars are big, heavy, durable and a little drifty but what did you expect from a several ton machine. While it is a little realistic (I'm using that term very loosely), the driving style the classic arcade style instead of the constantly overused simulator driving style. (As of version 1.0.6.0) There is a lack of content but what did you expect from a just out of private release game? Keep in mind that there is only a small team working on this game but have been really good about consistantly updating the game, listening to the community, and responding in the forums of the game. Wait if you feel iffy about early access but it seems very unlikley that these guys will burn you. Caged Element had a kickstarter but did not get enough publicity so they cancelled it. Undeterred, they went straight to early access and they are making this game not for money but out of labor of love for hardcore arcade racing games.			",167,9,11,12,13,2,9

Early Access Review
								A very fun, very intense, very fast futuristic racing game which is naturally lacking content due to it's early access.Gameplay: Racing is very satifying, but can sometimes be frustrating. The game harnesses super high speeds, resulting in very intense, fast moving action. You can find yourself being flung into the sky at points simply because you were going at speeds around 600 KMH, but this is not an issue in the more complete maps. Do not let the speed be a turn off for you however, as I would say its one of the most captivating mechanics of GRIP for good reason. To feel competitive in a race with such tremendous speeds around you, in such a way that your vehicle can drive smoothly up walls, is a feature found few and far in racing games, probably because its hard to utilise as a fun aspect of a race. GRIP executes this well with their tracks being built around many optional roads, shortcuts and large, curved terrain. This gives nice replayability with driving the race tracks, and can put forward different play styles as you go.Graphics: The graphics in GRIP are probably some of the best graphics I have seen of any racing game, to date. I have Play quite a few racing games over some time, and GRIP has captured almost perfect graphical immersion. From the textures on the car, to the back ground of race tracks, to the beautiful looking transparent shields, GRIP has shown no remorse towards a graphical component. When it comes to immersion, the game will produce a flame like HUD around your screen when you are hitting high speeds as well as a dust effect, having dots splinter your camera. You also see the physical gears of your rough gutted car switch as you gain speed. This game looks beautiful.Content: Of course, GRIP actually doesnt have a supreme amount of game to play currently as it is in early access. You will find yourself bored and wanting more within 5 hours of play time. As sad of a fact as this is, the developers are not weak with updates, most having content around 1.5 GBs, so you will always have something to toy around with on new updates. However as it stands now, you will run out of things to do quite quickly.I reccomend it. I encourage that you dont fear a lack of content, as it is dispensed some what consistantly. This game has mega potential, as I am sure you will feel when you try it for the first time.			",52,3,0,4,3,1,1

								What a fun experience!  What an awesomely spectacular game!It is fast-paced combat racing the way it should be.  Beautifully flowing tracks and intense speed.  At 400 km/h plus you're almost a fighter pilot :) ... and you WILL be doing some flying .  Futuristic-looking.  Different planets with different tracks.  I totally love the roll-cage thing.Even if you're not a big fan of racing games, like me, you might be surprised by this one.  I'd recommend GRIP any day.  For me it's the most fun since that old classic combat racer Re-Volt.  And it's going to keep getting better as development continues.  It most certainly gets my vote.			",62,17,1,0,3,2,0

								I've only just played a few minutes of this game, but damn, does it have potential. Great concept of flippable cars, physics and car handling feel tight and responsive, and the games weapons give it an almost ""mario kart"" arcade battle racer feel. The current tracks in the game are great and well designed, looking forward to whats to come.Currently has two player splitscreen but four player splitscreen is coming, and when it does, this will be my go-to game for some intense racing with mates.Really hope to see this game through early access and I wish the devs GL on their progress. Once the game is done I'd definitely pay for DLC tracks, too.Game ran flawlessly on my rig and felt super smooth and fast. Can't wait to see where the devs take this ;)			",44,6,33,2,6,0,0

Early Access Review
								As a guy who grew up playing rollcage, everytime i start the game I have the same feeling than I used to have in the original one. if you loved that game, it is a must buy! if you didn't, well you arrived in the right time to see it getting ressurected.As this game is EA still, it is no surprise that many many things are buggy, unbalanced or simply just need some polishing, as well as many content to be made for it.many people write about how things are getting better, car handle, maps, etc, and I don't really feel like repeating them. We just got the ability to recolor our cars as well as many many new small things like new lock-on indicators and ui and stuff like that. the game is progressing in a nice pace, the devs seem really dedicated to make the game as good as they can, and it's not a surprise as some of them are the original devs of rollcage, and I'm sure they want to remake is as much as I want a remake.Overall I can only recomend it if you are a fan of rollcage or other combat racers (eg wipeout, blur, split/secoound etc) and long for something epic with rocket boosters miniguns and neckbreaking tracks and speed. but you have to accept that there are bugs and very little content yet, but its getting bigger with very patch. So if you are into EA stuff go ahead throw a few bucks for the devs, if you are just getting into ccombat racers, or not really keen on EA, then just follow it and watch how it progresses, because it deserves the attention!

 Disclaimer - I have been gifted a free key for this game for review purposes, however my review will be kept as truthful as possible, since I am meant to help developers and buyers/gamers.    GRIP review  Overview ""GRIP is futuristic combat racer inspired by the Rollcaage games from 1999/2000."" A racing/twisted metal video game Developed by and Published by Caged Element Inc released in early access Feb 2, 2016. Graphics The graphics for an early access game are crazy good, I guess since the graphics become epic,   it would also take a epic good pc to run them on ""Epic"" as the highest you can go. Music/Options/Menu The music was really cool and pumping adding a nice feel to game like this, The menu was nice and simple easy to get a hang of, And the Options again very nice for a very early access game like GRIP. Pros and Cons Pros:LOTS of pure potenialA nice looking racing game with a fun twist4 modes which all change up the game quite nicelyCons:Semi decently optimisedYou need a decent pc to run on max graphicsI found a few bugs like falling through the map Final Rating A fun racing/arcadey type game with potenial and active Developers and a good future I give it a 8.5/10 I have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game. They make my review about games like this possible. If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group:   The Group  ",137,16,0,14,11,0,12

Early Access Review
								Review and Bug Report – Developers, this is for you.  3 weeks into early access and I’ve picked up this game, played it for over an hour, and I’m gonna start off this review by saying that this isn’t simply a spiritual successor to the Rollcage series. It IS Rollcage 3, whether you want to call it that or not.Now, let’s get into the actual review. This is based off of playing Time Attack for almost the whole time, and should be treated as such. The sense of speed is exhilarating. I never expected to come into it and do well, and I didn’t; the case was the same with the first two games. I crashed a ton of times on every lap, span off or did a 180, drove up the side of walls, left the track boundaries, always struggling to get back on track, and losing a lot of time in the process. But it never feels cheap, nor is it frustrating. When you do screw up, you always know that it’s because that you just couldn’t quite handle the beast that is your vehicle, and that’s great, because Grip – and Rollcage as a whole – is not an easy game/series by any means – this game is hard. It takes a lot of precision and skill to master handling this four wheeled juggernaut; the smallest mistake can screw you over, but it really is rewarding when you can get it under control. And even if you do crash, drive off or spin off a bunch of times, the game never stops being fun as hell to play. ***BUG REPORTING STARTS HERE***Now let’s get onto the bug reporting. As it’s only 3 weeks into early access, I can forgive the fact that the UI and everything except the core game needs a huge amount of work. Still, it needs to be addressed:Screen resolution options: The resolution sets itself every time I click the arrow to go through the available screen resolution settings. So when I go from 1280x720 to 1280x768, screen flashes to black and then sets to the new res. And this happens for as many different available settings there are: the screen flashes to black no more than a dozen times before I can reach 1080p. We need to be able to click through them all without it auto applying every time: give us an ‘Apply’ button or a dropdown menu, the current system is far too slow. Second issue – the res resets itself from 1080p (my selected res) to 720p when I alt tab out and back in, and to make matters worse, there’s no ‘Options’ menu in the Pause menu. So all that time spent clicking through every available resolution to get to the one I need, down the drain. After that I just left it at 720p out of frustration.The menus can’t be navigated without a mouse – not even the Pause menu. I don’t think the keyboard can be used either. So I can pause the game with my controller (for reference it’s an Xbone controller), but to resume I need the mouse, which requires me to get into an awkward position so that I can left click resume with my left hand while keeping my finger down on the right trigger to accelerate. That’s the next issue – upon resuming the game at the Pause menu while holding down the right trigger, it does nothing: I have to release it and press it again to accelerate. For some reason I can pause the game after I finish the race and viewing my ‘You placed 1st!’ (Hahaha, me, first…) – This should not be possible. Nor should I be able to pause the game at this point.Please auto-hide the cursor during gameplay, or when a controller is in use.The hit boxes for the menu buttons are too small to be clicked with a mouse: the hit boxes should be the same size as the menu buttons themselves. On the track Transport, on the planet Liddo 5, the frame rate gets cut in half every time I enter a tunnel, and returns to normal when I exit.The setup menu needs settings removed from it depending on the game mode currently selected. AI difficulty, number of bots, and number of laps are still included in Time Trial mode, even though there is no AI, and there are unlimited laps. ****BUG REPORT ENDS****Despite all of these typical Early Access issues (as is the way with Early Access), for the love of god, buy this game, and support the developers. You won’t regret it, especially considering everything that the team has to offer in the Early Access description. I’ve been waiting for Rollcage 3 for over a decade, and well, here it is. I was gonna give this game 22/10 but then the front half of my car got stuck in the ground when I landed after being launched into the air (fix this pls), so I’m gonna take half off and say 11/10, cos the AI names sound like Transformers.…♥♥♥♥ it, one of them is a Transformer and his name is Jetfire.

Early Access Review
								Being that this game is pretty early in early access, there's not a lot of stuff to it at the moment. What it does currently have, though, absolutely reeks of futuristic racing games from the 90s(San Francisco Rush 2049, Extreme-G, Wipeout, etc.), just with a modern day coat of paint. The tracks, the music, the vehicle design, the weapons and power-ups, and the overall vibe add up pretty nicely to something that makes this quite a spiritual successor to the game Rollcage, and a kind of game that we just don't see very often. If you want more than a small handful of areas, vehicles and things like online multiplayer(it has local splitscreen for people with actual irl friends), then you may want to wait a while on buying this. Just note that the price will go up ever so much as the early access program goes on. If however you're fine with it as it is and don't mind the current lack of content, I say go ahead and buy it.""10/10 Like Wipeout with wheels"" -IGN			",97,8,15,8,11,2,3

								This is currently in great shape considering the pre-alpha state, controls ae already tight, track design is really rollcage next level, weapons systems work and their initial soundtrack is excellent there's however clearly a lot of graphical (loads of pop in)  and other optimization left and the menu system needs a lot of work but for an old-school rollcage fan like myself seeing this coming to fruition is awesome.As far as spiritual psygnosis successors go this is leaps and bounds above formula fusion at this time, hopefully the devs reconsider the xbox one version as I would so love to have this on my xbox one.Looking forward to alpha, beta and release for sure.

								I got an e mail that says: GRIP is on early access.Without a slightest hesitation, i opened steam and literaly without even looking at the price. It was 20 somethinhg :)And you know what? It was totaly worth it. As a huge rollcage fan, i am realy hopeful for this game. Right now even the early access is looking awesome. Here are my opinions, pros and cons.I only finished 2 races in the game and tickled with settings. Design of the game is pretty straight forward and fluid.Gameplay feels like old rollcage and this is a good thing. Develoeprs should keep this unchanged.I'm sure tracks and music are gonna be realy fun and appropriate for the context.Only downside seems to be high performance graphics card requirement. My hd 6950 is having hard time running on high settings. I think this will be optimized as days go by. But the important thing about rollcage-like game like this is to be fluent and playable. This game doesn't require amazing visuals and stunning environment. This game has to keep to action and excitement up, and the gamer on toes. I'm sure we won't have time to appreciate visual details as we are strugling through obstacles and doding missiles. So YOU SHOULD NOT bother prepearing a demandind environment.

								If you like the original Rollcage games, then GRIP certainly is a game for you. If you don't know the concept of Rollcage yet: your car can drive on walls and roofs and it can drive both on its topside and underside. This creates an unique way of racing, because you can continue driving on falls and upside-down jumps. Combine this with various powerups as mines and rockets and you'll have a lot of fun. The gameplay of GRIP is already very enjoyable in this early access version. It's combination of racing and weapony provides a high-paced and intense experience. The graphics are great and the up-tempo music really adds to the feeling of speed. With each patch, the tracks are getting better flow and many improvements are made to the physics. Besides normal racing, there are interesting game modes such as time trial, arena (deathmatch), and playground (capture powerups in a sandbox environment) . The powerups such as speed boots, shields, mines, rockets and miniguns are fun and are visually appealing. All in all, all the main elements that you would expect in a combat racer are already there. Clearly, there are still downsides that can be expected in an early access version. Multiplayer mode is yet to be implemented. The content is still rather limited with one car and three racing tracks, one of which is heavily work in progress. There is also a noticeable framerate drop when shooting a minigun in some sections. Despite these downsides, you can have a lot of fun with this early access version. As final remark, I would like to add that this game has a great development team. The developers are easy to approach and are actively adressing player feedback. This gives the feeling that you are really involved in the development.			",30,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I VOTE A YESS!!! YESSS YESSS!!!!! its really hard to find an arcadey type racer nowadays that isnt cheesy or polished over like track mania. i like brutal racing and moments that make my hair stand on edge. Grip does just that. Its ultra fast and chaotic plus the music is the cherry on top honestly. Drumm and bass is meant for racing and grip does a great job with the selection. Yes, its in alpha, but i was very willing to support the developers as when i saw this, i flashed back to the days when i was playing rollcage with my dad back in 1999. never thought id see a game similar to it make a come back.

								Like the old Rollcage game but with modern graphics with the Unreal Engine 4. It does look really nice and performance is good as well. The content is still a bit lacking but there are more cars and tracks and everything planned for the full release. If you want this for multiplayer, then don't be fooled by the low playerbase. You will only be able to race with 10 people at the same time anyway and you can connect to a race which is already in progress, although you need to wait till the next round. So as long there are more than 10 players in multiplayer you won't notice any difference between 10,000 or 100 people playing it, since you will find a lobby with players right away and can't play with more than 10 anyway. Also missing players are replaced by bots to fill up the field if that is the case.Now I am not sure how many hours I will spend in this game but it is a really fun arcade futuristic racer and is basically a true Rollcare remastered version one could say. Definitely worth spending time on a few multiplayer races every other evening.			",131,38,4,30,85,1,22

								Hello people. I've been a fighting/racing games fan since the crash bandicoot and after that game rollcage was an epic adventure where there were no turning back. I mean i'd play with bots for eternity... seeing this game rebooted after merely 15 years later is like an epic xmas. If you're addicted to speed and weapons this is the game for you... do not expect something easy though... its hard as hell to play but its a blast. Also the games' devs are really cool people they will consider what idea or whatever you have in mind. Or what you say about things. That is the beauty of this game so much nostalgia and speed together even if you dont know the rollcage games i'd bet you will still like this game. ITS EPIC. is my last remark ^_^			",52,6,3,2,5,0,2

Early Access Review
Provisional Review, Full review once game leaves early access.TL:DR - Alright as-is, but will it be ready in time for an end of 2016 release? Also, I wish I could give this a ""meh"".Provisional review: I got this game for $15.29 CAD, and I am personally excited for the game to be finished, but as-is, the content is severly lacking, especially less than two months before the targeted ""final"" release date.Rant Incoming, mouse over if you care.Currently, the game's features, as compared to the aimed goals, are far below the values they hoped to reach in time for the release. There are only 5/16 tracks (not counting the hallowe'en tracks) from 2/4 planets, only two-player local splitscreen (although the beta currently has online multiplayer being playtested), no mod tools, and no career mode! According to the Early Access page, the developers have stated that they expect to finish ""the ""final"" version of GRIP by the end of 2016"". Considering that more than half of the game's content is missing just 8 weeks before their deadline, I am worried that developpment may be pushed back into mid-2017. From there, who knows when/if we'll ever see a final version.End RantSorry, I just had to get that off my chest, first. Now, as for the game itself, it revives the long-lost art of ""non-Mario Kart"" combat racing: The weapons are satisfying to use, although I feel like the missle needs to lock-on and launch faster. The gameplay is fast paced, and the physics are dead-on, but I feel as though the combination of the speed of the cars and the fact that even the smallet barrel can affect the car's path, it leads to a few too many circumstances where the car flies up in the air and off course, in one case costing me the race. This combined with the fact that the controls (not sure if this is just me and my toaster of a PC) feel delayed at times, regardless of keyboard or Gamepad, and it could make races seem unfair at times, especially since the AI can be brutal on the higher speeds and difficulties.  Overall, it just makes me wish that I could pick a maybe for a recommendation. Ultimatley, I have followed this game since it was first founded, and have good faith that the developpers will do whatever they can to make the game better as time goes on.Still, if you don't have this game in your library yet, hold off for a little bit: Follow this game on steam, and once developpment gets to a point that you feel confident enough to jump in to try the game... wait a little while longer, at least for a sale. This game is slowly, but surely, getting to its final state... but will it meet its end-of-2016 deadline?			",26,3,1,0,8,0,0

Early Access Review
								for a game that was released on my birthday, and considering it's essentially a reboot of one of my childhood game's, i'm a little annoyed that i've only just found out about Grip nearly a year after it's release...maybe now i can throw away my original copy of Rollcage?[gyazo.com] pffft nah never. This is even being made by some of the dudes who did the original. niceAnyway, IMO:-Grip looks great visually and retains the style of it's inspired original very well, not just in the levels but the cars too. -Performance wise, the only issues i've had has been while alt-tabbing... nothing new there. Otherwise it's been butter smooth for me.The controls and feel of the driving?-The speed feels great and faced paced once you get going and set up the race to use the faster engine types (a bit like mario karts 50cc/100cc/150cc etc).-The steering for keyboard users, I personally feel the steering aspect still need work, there's something about it i can't put my finger on but when going too fast or too slow, i end up losing my position in the race because i cant turn fast enough to correct a crash when im going slowly, and when im going fast i feel like its too easy to oversteer. A controller of some sorts is definately advised, as with pretty much all racing games. (or maybe i'll try and get my wheel to work...that'll be interesting)-Rolling in the air to perfect your landing is much harder than the original. it felt really slow to rotate and correct myself and by the time i'd started turning, i'd crashed awkwardly.But who knows, maybe i just need more practice since i haven't played a rollcage-esque game since 2004-6-the weapons so far are a trip down memory lanealthough missing some of the originals, but this is early access at the moment and there's more on the way so here's hoping for the time warp, wormhole and ice sheet to come back because they were my favourites:fingerscrossed:.-The music, while i'm not a fan of the genre, it definitely still suits the game very well so i don't mind listening to it since it isn't bad at all... just not to my taste to want to listen on the daily.I don't find the price to be too high either. In fact I would've probably paid a little more, since despite it's early access, it's still a great solid arcade racing game, and also because im slightly biased and loved the original.Oh it also has splitscreen so thats a great bonus. Remember the days when you'd invite a friend over to play games and not just rely on online multiplayer? good times.			",470,33,23,29,20,4,22

								Absolutely beautiful game honoring the old Rollcage games which I spent so many hours playing on my old pc as a kid..Then in highschool my friends used to sneak into the media room during sport hours and split-screen using the projectors.Not too much content so far but plenty to have a good time for a bunch of hours, and after online is released well that's pretty much infinite replayability right there. All the mechanics are done beautifully; nothing lame that helps you out of being completely disoriented after hitting a corner and spinning uncontrollably and then recovering and driving in the wrong direction and hating everything, which is good.My one request is they re-add those triple helix rockets from the original game because they were sick.

Early Access Review
								In todays world of steam many, many games get stuck in early access. I feared that a few weeks after I bought this game... since this was the first early access game I bought. Though the game still remains in early access, the devs have made vast improvement to the gameplay. From the difficulty, when I first played I outsmarted the AI and consistantly won 1st place within 30 minutes of playing. Now that I've jumped back in I'm struggling to get 5th. Another improvement is the handling, before when you hit something your car would just stop, now it feels much more natural. There are also many more improbements.My point being, they are updating and making the game better... nuff said.			",228,38,0,48,8,1,16

								Hi!I'm a Rollcage fan since '99 so I was very excited about this game since I first heard about it. The game is beautiful and it definitely has that feeling that I was looking for so long but you can't find it only in a Rollcage (inspired) game. These are my first thoughts after 2 hours of gaming:1. I miss the glow in front of the car when you reach near maximum speed.2. Where's the speed boost bonus if you hit acceleration as close as possible to the GO sing on start?2. The speed boost pickup feels like a steady acceleration instead of that instant 'omg' speed boom from Rollcage3. Too many mines4. I miss the spinning non-targeted rockets and a few Rollcage pickup very much! The teleport would be fun! I think emp is replacing the time slowing one, that is great. The point is that we need more pickup types.4. The physics engine feels unfinished, keep up the good work!5. Can't wait for more maps, multiplayer, campaign, etc!			",1,0,0,1,0,0,0

								Nostalgia holds you quite well in this game - but this doesn't mean that's all that keeps you playing. It recreates everything players loved about the originals but remasters it. While everything's not quite there yet (Early access), what IS there gives you confidence in that the devs know what they want to create, and how they wish to go about it.  My one gripe right now is the way the vehicles handle; everything is INCREDIBLY slippery and slight turns at high speed can REALLY screw up your drive. That and the lack of track variation right now does affect the replayability, but for so early in the EA lifespan plus Deathmatch with bots, and how well this project has progressed so far - it's almost a non-issue. And what's better than a PC game that has multiplayer splitscreen for good ol' party game fun?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								It has been a long time since I've had this much fun in a racing game. It is very fast-paced, the cars that flip over make racing both more forgiving and more fun, and the weapons are excellent. I don't know what to say, but GRIP is incredibly cool and great for multiplayer. Everyone I've showed this game to immediately loves it, and few racing games have had that effect.As for the early access matter, development appears to be going very well (they are adding a new car or track about every month). At present there are 7 tracks and 4 cars, and even if development magically halted right now, it would still be worth the $16 asking price. This is already an extremely fun game, and it will just get better as time goes on.			",35,8,7,5,2,0,9

								First things first: The game has the Rollcage feeling i had back in the day on my PlayStation. Besides that one could say it has not enough content but for early access i am ok with the price. The game is not optimized in any way to any hardware. It heats up my system more brutal than RotTR on Ultra. My i7 4790k is up to 58°C and the Sapphire R9 390x is at 68°C after 5 minutes of gaming. Compared to RotTR on Ultra the CPU is at 41°C and the graphics card barely hits 50°C playing 30 minutes. You should keep an eye on your temperatures while gaming. Have fun.			",67,14,1,4,5,1,7

								Three tracks, two classes of car, only singular race modes and I’ve sunk 15 hours into this bad boy. Without a doubt, some of the best fun I’ve had in a racing game in a very long time. You’ll have your head tilting and body leaning into corners with these furious races.Pros:Fast & fun gameplay – jump into a race and put the peddle to the metal. Prepare to 'woo'Killer music – original soundtrack is loads of fun and really suits the vibe of the gameShort game is a good game – great for burst gameplay sessions when you have twenty min to killActual skill is involved – learning when to apply the brakes, deaccelerate and line up your jumps makes you feel like you’re becoming a better racer. Also learning how to cop a hit can save you from spinning out from a missileDifferent day, different mode – Multiple modes of play are fun. You have standard races, elimination races, battle arena mode and time trial will keep you occupiedDiverse tracks – all the tracks are very distinct and have their own unique feel. You can also reverse and mirror the tracks tooCons:Too easy – at first I struggled to take first position, but now I can snatch the trophy even when giving the AI a lap leadPhysics are inconsistent – much better than what they used to be, but the physics can get annoying when you’re airborne or collide with other racersStatic tracks – at the moment there is only one track which can have its course altered by racers. This feature is promised to be fleshed out, but for now it’s lackingPoints about early access:Updates occur about once a month, but they usually have substantial content. The physics engine is being worked on, so at the moment the car physics are a bit wonky. But I like to think that adds to the challenge. The developers are very active in the forums and chat to lowly peasants like myself. More tracks, cars, songs and modes to come.This game is incredible. Get it. ",31,4,2,9,5,0,10

Despite being alpha, this game allready feels 100x more polished then other alpha games i've gotten in to, and it's one of the first new releases i've played that i actually had fun. Side note: I find the steering sensitivity to be way to high and i'd like to be able to adjust it, aswell as being to do custom keymaping would be great as well.Overall this is a fantastic game,so thankyou GRIP team for bringing this game to me, and keep up the good work.

Early Access Review
								Warning: This game is still in development! Having that said, this game proves 2 things.1: Arcade racing is far from dead. 2: '90s/ '00s gameplay still has a reason for existing today. I will explain these points. This game is based on a late PSX arcade racer called Rollcage. It was a futuristic racer like Wipeout and F-zero, with speed and course layout were the primary focus of the game. As with wipeout, Rollcage had weapons, which (if used correctly) could give you an edge or help you get back in the race. But most of all it was the rush of combining the speed, chaos and great music that made the game great.GRIP doesn't do much different than Rollcage did in it's days. It's still amazingly fast, it's tracks are still build to give you that awesome rollercoaster feeling and the music still completes the experience. But it only adds to that old Rollcage game with everything we like from our games these days, without taking anything away. The graphics are great, the tracks look magnificent, with my avagage PC setup the game moves at a steady 60 fps, weapons look awesome and work like a charm the 6 cars (which differ more than enough) sound great with each car another engine sound,. Talking about sound, there is so much quality and detail in that department here. We got the different engine sounds per car, the speed boosts sound powerful, you can hear the drivetrain sqeak at high speeds, missiles and machineguns sound great and the music completes it. You can do some basic car customisation by choosing the color of your car's paintwork, changing the rims and their paintjob and change which kind of tires you want on the car (although it doesn't change how the car handles). Then there are quite a few tracks and game modus (including a new online multiplayer) added to the game allready, but more will come. Tracks can be rough, which might make your car bump out of bounds, but resetting your car to the track is both easy and looks awesome too. The best thing is: the action and fun is so good, that it doesn't matter if you get 1st or last. It brings a smile to your face and before you know it, you are in another race, having the time of you life boosting through upsidedown tunnels, blasting other cars away, dodging obstacles and enjoying the immense sense of speed this game gives you. Rollcage is back, better than ever and now for the new generation to enjoy :D			",43,1,3,10,5,0,4

								good potential in this game. needs a lot of work though before I can see myself giving a flawless review like I want to do. the game is fun but there are quite a few glaring issues I have with it. the cars needs better tranction as they feel like they're jsut floating on the ground or wall you're drivign on and love to spin out if you so much as bump into a pebble. and if you bump into another car both cars will spin out, it takes away fromt he flow of the race as you'll have massive pile ups of cars a lot of times. secondly the missles tend to explode as soon as deployed hurting you more often than your target. map design is good enough but the physics need to be much smoother to fit some of them as they clearly had obsicles and sharp turns in mind to make it more challanging but without smooth turning and your car jumping all over the place it really isn't an enjoyable experience to try to play said maps. thirdly, in some maps if you get flung off the side of the map from the controls being not all the responsive or hitting something on the track you can run on the side of invisible walls set throughout the course. this leads to some very hilarious moments where you'll be driving your car sideways in the sky. I would reccomend putting some taller walls on some levels so if you spin out or get flung you don't immediately get outside the intended play area of the track. thankfully there is a reset button which helps in situations like that but it's uncanny how many times I found myself having to use it because of things liek that. these are the biggest issues I have with the game but overall I see a lot of promise in this game and I hope as it develops we'll see some of these issues fixed. also just a suggestion to the developer, maybe add a turbo boost meter that fills up with boost pickups? I know you have turbo as a power up but I feel a bar that everyone can fill up and store for later use and use it up only as long as you have the turbo button held meaning you could just give yourself a nudge to get going again and still have plenty left over would be a very welcome addition to the game. getting up to speed after a crash is much to slow given how often you'll end up crashing from the controls and bouncy nature of the physics as it is right now. being able to get back up to speed faster after a halt would help keep the pace of the race going for the player. anyways I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a combat racing game for the price and I wish the best to the developer in making this game the best it can be.

								Really really fun. At first I thought it had a really big learning curve in skill because the speed was to fast, but then I learned that the game was set to hard mode automatically. I could plug in my controller, and despite it not working in the menu, it was flawless ingame. The game is fun and competiative and multiplayer, although has not been implemented yet, would be a fitting addition to the game. Arena mode is even more fun and competative and gives a real halo for the original xbox vibe. Overall, great game for just being released yesterday and I'm excited for the ptaches and added content to come. :D			",50,6,0,2,2,0,1

								There might not be that much content featured in this game so far.But what little there is, feels absolutely amazing and after a little digging, you find out that it's done by a very small team of devs. Which makes it seem even more amazing!Like I said, there isn't much so far. But sometimes you just need to race 2-3 tracks. Yell at the game because it once again threw you into gods ring muscle, or into a dead end. All while listing to music from back when you where just a stupid little kid, and this game really does take you back to a time when you where just that, a kid.I can't wait to see this game in it's full glory!

Early Access Review
								Great paced racer which really reminds me of the craziness of the likes of F-ZeroGX. The only thing that I can think could possibly be improved is totally losing control of the vehicle and the fact that it keeps accelerating, meaning you can be in the air going at ridiculous speeds and pass a lot of the other racers qutie easily just by not letting go of the accelerator (I realise this is playing it the ""wrong"" way but it's still a bit annoying when it happens because it can feel like cheating). Still highly recommended because when the mechanics, physics and feel of the vehicles all come toether and you keep proper control it's amazing fun and feels properly solid, avoiding the ""floaty"" feel some other racing games suffer from.

								I saw this a while ago and finally decided to give it a go. I can't stop playing. Graphics are fantastic and so smooth. The sound effects are great, I personally love the speed booster sound. I think the ability to use your own music is a great idea. With 'catchup' on and the AI on hard it is mayhem and so much fun.I recommend 100% thus far and can't wait for future updates.

								   You know, that sense then you was sitting there, at age of 8, for example, watching the opening cinematic and questioning yourself ""will i ever see such awesomeness like this intro..?"" and still the game as beatiful, flashing and emotive, like CTF_face, all theese futuristic constructions floating in the sky..    And then like ten years later you sitting here and get that nostalgic feel, questioning yourself ""will i ever see the one of my school favorite games realised the way that it deserves to..?""    And then you come across some title named ""GRIP"". And then you drop your jaw because THAT'S IT! Exactly one of the best PSX era racing games been reproduced with a proper vibe, awesome quality and great taste! That's just awesome!   It's a musthave for all who seen the PSX era and just rally really good futuristic racing game, who haven't.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								The asking price may be a bit high for a game thats still in development, but after getting in a solid hour of gameplay and racing multiple tracks several times i can honestly say that i havent played a racing game this fun in a long time.This game plays somewhat like a Mariocart game or the game Blur for the playstation referring the pickups you get during racing.  There's even a missile with a blue smoke trail that goes for the guy in first reminicent of the blue shell from Mariocart, which is always a good laugh (unless you're in first).  The car choice is very limited with mulitple colorations for the 2 choices, but this isnt really a bad thing.  The tracks are mostly well designed and thought out quite nicely.  The scenery of each track is great to look at too, especailly when you crash into something and come to a dead stop (then you can really enjoy the view!).  The controls for the game, overall, are very responsive which is great.  However, there are times where, when your car catches air, the vehicle controls about as well as a paper plate with a radio transmitter on it with you telling it through a microphone to turn left or right depending on where the track goes. This can be frustrating mainly due to the fact that you can throw yourself off the track by mistake, ruining the great positioning you achieved.  Now, this isnt game breaking by any means, but its still quite the annoyance when your car bumbs into a rock going 300 mph which sends your car tumbling and skipping along the track every which-way making it all the more difficult to regain control and get your car moving in the right direction again.  But getting a better feel for how the tracks are and how your car handles on them can compensate for this later on.The A.I. is also good.  They are about as competent as you are on the track and can mess up the same as a normal player would.  If the A.I. becomes too challenging for you, there are adjustments in the game that makes it so the computer wont completely leave you behind, giving you a chance to catch up.There are a few things still needing improvements on, but the developers are excellent in recognizing potential problems and correcting them.  They are deligent in keeping their game as balanced yet fun as possible.Overall, if you have 15 bucks to spare and are in the mood for EXTREMELY fast paced racing, i highly recomend this game. 9/10 ",25,5,1,9,3,0,7

								GRIP has elements of F-Zero and JetMoto of the old days and REDOUT, Formula Fusion, Radial G, Roll Cage  and Quantum Rush Champions of modern days, and is a fun sci-fi racer. I think for the genre it is second only to Redout from that list.

								Not a bad reboot of Rollcage, but this release still needs work. I'm writing this review on the first day that multiplayer came out. So far, it is a lot like the original; fast, hectic, cool music, cool ""cars, etc. What really bothers me is how unforgiving this game is. I'll go into pros and cons.Pros:+ beautiful graphics+ fast and exciting gameplay+ great art design, both with the cars and tracks+ classic Rollcage feeling+ soundtrack is perfectCons:- you will reset your car contantly from flying everywhere, reset is a necessary game mechanic- cars are flat out difficult to control... wall riding is common, despite brakes and ""drift"" (I see this with other players all the time too - refer to above con)- the camera is wonky; rather than staying behind your car, on tight turns and crashes the camera will do whatever- in multiplayer, collisions with other players are way off: you are likely to ricochet into the walls from hitting other players while they ride off unscathed- heavier cars are just betterThis game is fun and addicting, but it would be a little better if the cars were just easier to control themselves so they work better with the hectic combat, high speeds and hazard-littered racetracks. I'll still recommend, for nostalgia and early access.			",141,11,0,23,7,0,10

								Yes, its still a work in progress, but boy, trying that out was fun!Beforehand, I'm not the player with the most experience regarding racing games in here. My last really nice memory of a racing game was Rollcage, apart from gaming with kids with Mario Kart 8. GRIP fits well into that combination, actually. The good:Its massive fun to slam down acceleration and ram yourself through the track. Steering seems a bit assisted with regards of turning the car into the correct direction, but this could be just the better steering possible at low speeds. Anyways, its not bothering me much and adds to the flow of the game. Control of the cars is a bit rough, but ok if you step down from the gas sometimes. Rating of the tracks currently has only normal and hard a modes, I think that's accurate :) AI seems okGraphics are gorgeous! I'm trying the game on a beamer via the steam link and the steam controller and I'm blow away.The Bad: After 6 to 7 matches it gets a bit repetative. But this is due to the status of the game and I am rather sure that the finalized game will have more tracks and something like a league-mode. Nothing Ugly found so far, keep it up!  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								So if you liked Rollcage, here it is once again! And it’s looking sweet!It's still early days of course, so much of what’s here will be getting enhanced, but already it’s a solid build that runs smooth and shows a lot of potential. It is not an easy game in the slightest, there's certainly a lot for the devs to do in the handling department, and there's currently no online multiplayer (although it is coming and is a priority). It does however currently have a 2 player split screen mode.Should you get it? If you're crazy about futuristic racers, and loved the original, then yes absolutely. If you're not quite a fanatic about this kind of thing, perhaps hold off until it’s a bit more refined. Personally I’m super stoked about this one and can't wait to see how it's development progresses.			",390,25,14,15,18,3,15

								""Roads...? Where were going we don't need 'roads' "" A great futuristic racer with all of the familiar ""tropes"" from what made the original inspiring series so awesome. TLDR: Worth Buying! Great graphics, sweet electronic tunes and fluid controls.Sleek design, a unique mechanic of driving on any surface at high speeds, and the unbridled speed and chaos of launching yourself at high velocity into a wall only to barrel off and continue blazing along down the track. This stays true to its source material by including a great soundtrack with heavy electronic tunes that blast along as you continue down the track. Some cool weapon pickups (I wish the warphole weapon of the original were here still!) and great track design.If you remember the PS1 era futuristic racer (Rollcage) this has all the original trappings of that great series and more, presented with a stylish visual update. If you're a fan of futuristic racing games or racing games in general it deserves a playthrough especially if you have never experienced the series before. As far as future content goes, the tracklist is very limited as of 07/22/16 at  there are only 4 tracks and no League Mode as of yet. It appears the developers intend to include at least league mode. Hopefully some tracks similar to the levels in the original i.e. a downtown metropolis / futuristic city, a coastal area with building struts you can take out to take down buildings, a lava level, etc... Would be great to see! What matters is what content that is presented is very well done. I almost feel I could do without the playground, deathmatch, and elimination modes in favor of a more robust league / cup tournament mode and more levels. If you're a fan of the old series Rollcage it's a no-brainer purchase. If you're a fan of racing games otherwise, it's worth experiencing. If you're a fan of electronic tunes and futuristic stuff / cart esque racers with weapon pickups, you'll probably dig it. This is the best futuristic racer available on Steam as of 2016, hands-down. A great addition to a great franchise.			",354,104,3,23,6,0,20

								Fast! Fun! Fantastic!Anyone who played the original Rollcage games back on the Ps1 will adore this reboot. I have waited many years for someone to remake this game and this does not disappoint. I cannot wait to see where they go with this game and it's nice to come across a good early access game that's not riddled with bugs.For the other people moaning about the physics and controls, this is what makes this game what it is, I wouldn’t have it any other way. Nice to see developers keeping to the roots of a classic. Bravo. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Rockets, machine guns, more rockets, explosions? It's overcharged, super fast aerodynamical insanity!Ride on ceilings, walls, land and keep going as if you just barfed all over Newton's first law of motion, your maths is no match for my magic flippity reversal wheels you Woolsthorpe born plagueling!Yes, it's that good, sure it's only got 2.2 tracks as of the end of Jan 2016 and a few extra fun stuffs, But it's EA and there is more to come, If you loved the Rollcage games, you're going to find Grip more than adequate to induce a full blown nostalgiagasm for the PS1 days with Fatboy Slim in the BG (he's not in Grip sadly BTW) but there are some nice techno/electronic beats to fill in the noise between the explosions and engine RAWRS!Buy this game... Or wait, there is more to come, it's still EA, I just possess a raging semi for this title having played both Rollcage games for years...You can see what a normal Race is like here:

								Man! This game is totally awesome even now, considering it's only in pre-alpha! It brings back the old memories of my old time favourite racing game Rollcage I-II which were among the first games I ever played on PC. The developers catched the essence of the good old speed&thrill combo, and mounted it on a modern engine which looks awesome! The game sure has potential, and can be a lot of fun (not to mention the splitscreen awesomeness), so have fun with it, I do recommend!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								WOW!! Simply amazing.This game has potential to be one of the greatest. Being one of the few lucky individuals to beta test GRIP, I have seen this game grow.As mentioned by others, GRIP was not created by a big game company whose only interest is revenue. GRIP is a small family of developers whose only interest is creating a really good game for people to enjoy. The proof is their involvement with the community. Not only reading people's comments/suggestions, but also taking part in discussions. When was the last time one of the big game companies got involved and actually listened to the public?GRIP is constantly being updated and improved. The music and the game go together really well. The sound effects of the vehicles and especially the weapons are really cool. The level of detail (vehicles, weapons, and environment) looks really nice, even when going 400km/h. The in-game play is challenging, even on the easiest setting. Overall, I highly recommend this game and for less than $20, how can you go wrong?			",33,1,1,3,3,0,1

								ROLLCAGE IS BACK!!!! Ok, its not rollcage, but....well, it is. And for those that dont know what rollcage is, (shame on you!), think of it like, if Mariokart and Rocketleague, took lots of coccaine, had sex, this is the love child. If you like speed, you'll love this, its like no other racing game ever made. But more than that, its difficult in a way that when you get it right, you feel like the baddest mutha ever and everyone should bow to your greatness. The game is still in early access which means bugs, but not as many as i thought, the main ones being collisions sometimes causes cars to get stuck, if you get knocked off track it can be a pain getting back on especially if its walled. But other than that its smooooooooth. It currently has no online multiplayer but does support local split screen but if i was you, id get it now and get practicing...you will need it!10/10 would snort this s**t again!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Along with Redout I consider Grip one of the best futuristic racers available on Steam.I guess the best way to describe it is this: you drive huge, rocket powered tractors that can be flipped upside down and still drive without issue (wheels are magnetically attached). This means that level design can get pretty crazy. Thankfully, it does.There's plenty of variety on the tracks, but they are all designed to let you do weird stunts like driving on walls and ceilings all while you shoot everything on sight. It also has really good visuals, great performance, split screen support (this is a huge plus for me) and a unique, rough looking visual style. It's good! I highly recommend it for fans of the genre.			",234,18,31,12,12,0,10

								So far, from what i've played [also tried a pirated version so there's a bit more than what it shows as played time], the game has huge potential to be an actual succesor of the Rollcage series. I hope they won't be stuck with 4 vehicles and the handful of weapons and more (both original and from the Rollcage series) weapons and vehicles will be introduced into the game.I would also like several other features like the EMP being able to turn off the missile's guidance system, since imo it would be completely logical and by the time the systems are restored the rocket should technically collide into what was in its front... nope, that's the only one i can think of that i want.I can also envision GRIP introducing a crate system like CS:GO, Rocket League and so on with special rims, bodies and maybe even weapon effects and colors [like different EMP color or flashy or flamey]. As Rocket League and CSGO, those items should be completely cosmetical and not tear the gamers into 2 tiers like CoD series.The tracks, most of them at least are gorgeous, in design, textures and pathway, though i still manage to lose path quite easily or fall entirely in love with a pillar that was in front of me, making love to it at 400km/h. [METRIC SYSTEM FTW!]The HUD is quite minimal while staying true to the predecessors with the same leaderboard design that i had quite a rough time in the childhood to understand it properly.All-in-all i expect good from it because it already looks like it will be as badass as the originals.

								Grip's got tons of potential.I've never played the Rollcage games (which I'm actually kinda disappinted about since I grew up with a PS1) but this game will still feel nostalgic if you've ever played any old school arcade racer. The cars do take some getting used to; like a lot of people have mentioned, I got my ♥♥♥ kicked to hell and back on my first race. A couple of rounds later, though, and I was consistently placing higher on the game's default difficulty settings. Hell, I even won one race. The battle arena mode is fun too, and it'll be a total blast if online multiplayer makes it into the game. The weapons that are already in the game feel good, the cars have a great sense of speed to them, the tracks are pretty well designed (although there's not a lot yet) and the sound design's great. I LOVE drum and bass, so the kickass soundtrack is a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome bonus.The one and only negative thing I can think of so far is the game's sheer lack of content. As of right now, there's: 1 car, 3 tracks, and 3 battle arenas (I haven't tried out the ""playground"" thing yet). But that's fine since the game's in early access...the devs have shown us what they plan to do and this game can only get better as they add more content and tweak what's already here. The game runs great for me; I have a 6-core AMD processor, 8 gigs of RAM, and a GTX 970 (which is still an admittedly powerful card) and so far on max settings I've never seen a single dip below 60fps. The one guy who said this game is terribly unoptimized must be running Grip on a literal toaster; for an early access game running on Unreal 4, Grip is as smooth as hot butter.Just a quick note to the devs if they ever see this: It'd be cool if cars had health meters in races; I feel like blowing up and respawning might be a little less punishing in some situations. It'd also be neat if we saw the arena mode expanded with deathmatch-style rounds or even some team gameplay. Just suggestions; don't get me wrong, the game's already a ton of fun.Final verdict: Grip's a real breath of fresh air in a racing genre currently plagued with an over-emphasis on realism. It just wants you to have fun. I suggest you buy it now before the price goes up!			",110,8,17,3,3,0,0

								Ok. Remember playing hot wheels when you were young? Shooting up your brothers and sisters' vehicles and learnig how to be a general douch, While occasionally pulling off stunts.  This game is Very nice and you would definitely get the same feeling from here. It's fast and the mech-like vehicles gives you a weird sense of badassery without doing really anything.The only real Items I have to pick with this is: Lack of barriers, bounce physics and machine gun.Barriers because it is amazing to get on a mountain and be able to just flip or flop off of and back to stage.(Made me think of Mass Effect), BUT! flying off  into them amidst heat is really annoying. One major flop and that race is done. (Speaking of when online was to hit).Bounce Physics. In some parts of the maps there are spots In the middle of the road where you can just flip out. Sky Track Has landing points where you will pop off of the road, and if you have played the track for a long while you notice, falling off is the easiest thing to do there.  Missile? Off you go. Machine gun> Goodbye. Random wreck because all other racers spun out due to bounce? You know the drill. Just tone down the bouncing on the road. Machine Gun. This seems to be overpowered. I know this isnt finished but just so you know. Machine Gun makes the vehicles hit bounce and swerve (of course) as long as you keep hitting them. It takes down the opponents full shield and can still kill that opponent IF you tardet only him. All in one. Maybe im wrong ther, but i'm positive I've destroyed may cars by just slowing down and letting it go.  Oh, You can glitch through Sky Track. Besides these, This is just an awesome game.Lastly, I thought having to hand break just to make a small turn sometimes was a pain, but the vehicles are massive and it began to feel good.Edit: Last Last thing... Hitting barrels that are strewn about and flying because of it. Make them pause you, Not send you packing.			",9,1,0,1,0,0,0

								A well made, beautiful, fun and exhilirating game!! I'm a very happy Kickstarter backer!Things to keep in mind:- I tried playing this on an MSI 970 on low settings in 1080P and the game would go from 20FPS to 40FPS contantly, making driving nearly impossible. After getting a 1080 Ti card and setting everything to EPIC with 1440P screen, this game flies!!! And the GPU is only loaded 36% during the entire game session. (TLDR; Get a proper GPU!)- It's important to note that the ""reset"" button is important to bind or you will hit your head against the wall every time you go out-of-bounds - which you will, repeatedly!- The Multiplayer is very fun but needs a bit clearer ""status"" so you know what to do and how it works, joining an ongoing game can make you wait 20 minutes...

FX8350/970 - everything on ultra and silky smooth.- Beatiful looking.- While strange at first, the handling of the cars is pretty decent and doesn't take long to get used to.- The banging dnb soundtrack.- Track design.- Good selection of game modes.- Devs seem very devoted to this project.- Bots are smart enough to enjoy single player thourougly.Cons:- Some cars seem OP.- Crashes can be a little too unforgiving.- No controller support in menus as of yet.- Can't think of much else here!All in all 9/10 - refreshing to play an early access game that feels this good.

I am usually very hesitant when it comes to remakes, but when I saw the first video of GRIP, I immediately backed in even though it wasn't even available as a demo or anything. And I can tell you this: THIS IS ROLLCAGE. If Rollcage was made today, that's how it would look, sound and feel. I am absolutely mind blown, this is totally awesome comeback! The game is VERY fast, the powerups and weapons are juicy, the tracks that are available now are well thought out and interesting to drive. The only thing that I'd love is a bit more melodic/fuild drum'n'bass as a soundtrack, the current tracks are great, but they're all a bit samey. Give me Aphrodite! Give me EZ Rollers! Give mee more! Even at this early stage I am giving this game 9/10 - it's an absolute legend of a game. If you like fast paced, futuristic racing and if you like drum and bass - get it now, I guarantee you won't be disappointed!			",156,56,5,25,22,2,22

								AMAZING! It is a must buy if you love combat racing games or grew up playing Ja X ike me. Never played the first Grip but this is really only the most modern combat racing game out there, so the nostalgia is there. Highly recommned this to anyone that loves this genre, so support this title if you do. There is also a hug update coming in the next few months that overhauls the game. This is my first ealy access game so i am not sure if the price goes up once it is finished.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								In a world of people trying to make AAA racing games with quests, storylines, open world, etc, (looking at you, Forza) this game is an absolute GEM.I grew up playing POD (Planet of Death) an old school racer similar to this. I mainly love shooter games but GRIP is a diamond in the rough of modern racing games. Who cares about upgrades and quests? I just want a high octane, violent, FAST racing game that I can let off some steam and ""need for speed"" in. This game nails it.Oh, and the music is ON POINT. High paced techno for the win.

								This game takes me way bak to my Playstation (1st gen) days. This is a really good homage to the Rollcage games I loved from my youth. The graphics and sound design are on point, the controls are what I remember from all those years ago and the feel of speed is very real. I thouroughly enjoy this game. There are however, two things this game is missing:1. destructable environment2. customisable controls for game padsOther than that this game is a surefire fun fest.			",17,0,1,0,0,0,1

								GRIP brings back all the good Rollcage memories I have, turbocharges them and puts drugs into the engine. You can truly feel the speed when moving at speeds exceeding 700km/h while dodging your fellow racers' weaponry. For an early access game, the graphical quality is really good. The cars are a bit difficult to drive without any Rollcage experience, but the controls are intuitive enough to allow for quick adaption.I'd recommend this game to all of my friends!UPDATE (10.12.2016):Since I posted this review, a lot of things have happened. Online multiplayer is currently in public beta, there are new cars, car customisation, new tracks and a completely redesigned main menu UI. All in all, the improvements are absolutely fantastic!

								When I was younger I loved this game and it is back!!!At the beginning I was afraid to buy it because, keyboard user..., but you can get used to it.So... About controlls when you press the turn button it should react immediately but its not and when you turn ( pushing turn button to the limit ) it feels like its not enough.So my suggestion is make it immediately react when you push a button and make it more turnable? just a little bit, because in such and amazing, epic, fast phasing game you dont need to use brakes only if you feel you gonna fail a turn. Feels like you gonna lose 1-3 positions if you gonna use a brake.Another suggestion is, when you take a tool / weapon make voice speech to tell you what kind of fool / wep yoo took, it will help a lot.Shield feels a little too long... I mean if wep / tool is taken by someone and you won't get it then make shield shorter or leave as it is if everyone could take it.Another thing is game UI could be better before you launch a game, come on it's 2016! :DLater on you could add car decal ( graffity, random lines, flames, camo etc), rims.Can't wait for more weapons, tracks, car.Music is amazing.

								after playing this game for 30 minutes. i was amazed by how well this game was designed, its brilliant. for a small team of 10 people, the developers of this game have done a wonderful job at creating a game based off the Rollcage game from way back in 1999 - 2000. There is still some improvements to be made to this game, but overall, the game is fantastic. For it being very new, it's very well optimised and i have no issues playing at low-medium settings with my 920m. i highly recommend this game to everyone, even if your not a fan of racing games.

Early Access Review
								GRIP, a game that is aiming to return to the unique style of car combat racing games that were Rollcage & Rollcage 2. The developers vision is very apparent, they know exactly what they want this game to be, and represent. High octane driving that will literally make your head spin as you try your best to keep control of your car as you fly down the race track at 300mph+.Winning in this game isn't just about being fast, regardless of what style of race event you are entering. It's about driving on each of the beautifully designed and well crafted tracks intelligently. Using the multiple routes the tracks offer you to your advantage, using the speed boosts effectively, collecting power ups and using them to pummel your opposition into submission all the while avoiding their returning fire. The AI are intelligent and aggressive, requiring you to keep your tactics changing almost instantly on the fly throughout the race. (I can only imagine what racing against real people will be like)The game also features a stellar soundtrack, it's one of the few games in my library where instead of having my own music blasting in place of the games, I happily turn up the in-game music and enjoy it. This game is indeed a very worthy spiritual successor to Rollcage & Rollcage 2. I cannot reccomend it enough to anyone who enjoyed those games, or who enjoy a tough, yet very rewarding combat racing game. Definetly worth the asking price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The gameplay is awesome.  The physics are awesome.  The soundtrack is awesome.  The high speed is really satisfying when you get on a role.Need to add native support for Dualshock 4, though DS4 tool isn't complicated.Please if and when a PS4 version is released, make it cross platform if at all possible.  Also it would be especially awesome if when online multiplayer is released, it is possible to use splitscreen at the same time as online.  Perhaps also increase splitscreen to a max of 4 players so I can game across 4 monitors with 3 others.I know core gameplay is the focus right now in development, but I bought a gift copy of this game for my friend who was not familiar with Rollcage, but was familiar with Drome Racers.  One thing he would have liked is some sort of introduction to the game (maybe an introduction or tutorial track).  The campaign mode is still up and coming, I know, and I assume there will be some sort of introduction there as well.  Maybe sort tracks by difficulty, also.If you guys can get this game polished out and get some marketing for it- maybe get in contact with some other influential Rollcage fans (maybe Sony), and show them how great and unique the concept is, I truly believe this game will sell millions.  Maybe you could get some more people working on it too so you can get it out earlier (hint hint wink wink).			",48,5,2,5,6,0,2

								Currently, Grip stands as the forerunner of the futuristic arcade racer. It plays like it's spiritual predecessor Rollcage, which ate up  countless hours back in the day on my psx. Graphically though its very sharp, using Unreal Engine 4 it shines. Also despite still being in development this game blazes, currently with all settings turned to max its staying pegged at 144fps which is the cieling I set to match my monitors refresh rate. The scenery blazes by, the cars are nicely detailed and little things like the smoke trail from a fired rocket all show nicely. Control wize its spot on. I'm playing with an Xbox 1 pad and it reminds me of a slightly tighter wipeout. The courses are limited currenlty but smartly designed with alternate routes and plenty of oppurtunities to drive on the walls or ceiling in a bid to gain advantage over an opponent. Its in early access and you can tell, the presentation is rough, switching resolutions is kind of a pain.  Game modes are limited but shows the potential of where the devs are headed. Overall I would definately reccomend even in its early state, currently the best futuristic arcade racer on steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								WARNING: This review was written when this game was in Early Access. If and/or when the title is fully released, I wll eventually get around to changing my review to reflect that.I may have played the original Rollcage once in my life, years ago. Whatever the case, I had one of the toys as a child and loved the ♥♥♥♥ out of it.I bought grip because it looked fun and I wanted combat racing without mario in it. It's been a lot of fun. The weapons are alright, the car handling is okay, and the wallriding/upside-down driving functionality works great. The missile pathing still needs some work, but the devs have been on that from the getgo, trying to get it right. The physics in the game also need some work, as hitting things can send you flying in directions and ways that don't make much sense. Don't worry too much, as the devs have tweaked the physics in every patch, and are trying very hard to get it right.Now, is the game worth the price? Eehhh.....maybe. Depends on you really. It is a ton of fun though, and you should play it for a few hours before you really drop it. And if you're having a ton of trouble flying instead of driving, try turning down the engine power in the settings.			",98,9,0,8,4,1,8

								Big fan of the Rollcage games so i knew i needed to get this one aswell. After sometime playing i was very pleased i made the purchase. Grip has really nice looking graphics and a really familiar feel so i felt right at home from 1st race onward. Performance wise it runs well and loadtimes are really short which is great. Theres lots of options and customization to choose when it comes to actual gameplay so you can make every race just the way you feel like. As a big Drum n Bass fan i can say the soundtrack couldn't be any better as the original games exposed me to this lovely genre, im happy that Grip continues this trend.Overall im very happy whats here but i also like to see what the updates will bring to the table.I will also do my best to spread the message about this gem of a racing game.

We will be adding destruction to the game, just need more time. We've always wanted to do this, just we haven't been able to dedicate the resources thus far :/""2.Allow use to use our computer gaming mouse to steer.3. The tracks seem just way too short.

I cannot see myself playing this unless I can use my computer gaming mouse to move my car with precision.Look, you guys responded to a nobody gamer. You see people? We need more developers that actually RESPOND to your needs AFTER the game is put out. Chris, you are the opposite of Sean Murray. Thank you for taking my thoughts and considerations into serious account.Even if you do not implement mouse control, provide a track designer or even make the obstacles destructable, I would recommend this game for the sole fact that you LISTEN to your customers and fans.Thank you, Chris.

								Every racing game I have ever played, I have thought to myself ""It's good, but... It's not rollcage"". But no longer!The game is amazing, and you have a LOT of fun playing it - the sense of speed is incredible. Powerups turn the tide of the race, and can easily knock someone in first place in to last if timed right. The level design is very very well made too.My only concern with this game is that it probably won't remain active online for very long. I found this game by watching some rollcage videos randomly online - it's not ""front page stuff"" at the moment. Online multiplayer will need a ""hook"" to keep people playing it - unlockable customisations like rocket league would be really cool.			",170,30,3,14,14,1,11

								Things I liked about GRIP:  The overwhelming sense of speed it gives.  The huge weight of the vehicles that you can feel while driving.  The awesome graphics.  The powerful sound FX of the combined internal combustion and jet (rocket?) engines.  The atmospheric racing circuits on several different planets.  The absurd amount of practice and luck necessary to win on highest difficulty (just like it was in the Rollcage games).  The community-oriented developers with their regular updates to the game. Things I did not like about GRIP (even considering it is still in Early Access):
The sheer lack of tooltips/explanations for in-game settings. You have to browse the internet to know what some of them do or how they do it.  On the final note: while reading some of the game forums and lurking in the GRIP community for a short while, I got the impression that the developers still cannot decide how to make GRIP appeal to the old fans of Rollcage games while at the same time being attractive to the casual gamers (you know, so that they do not rage quit before the 2 hour mark and decide to refund). I'm afraid this might not end well for anybody. Only time will tell, I passed my 2 hour mark already. The game is a little gem that needs a bit more polish. Well, actually, it needs a lot of hard work...Still, well worth the money and your (scarce) time you might want to invest in it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								a game like Rollcage and Mega Race for about the price of a single day meal? COUNT ME IN!! This is still in Early Access, but if you love Racing with an action twist including Missles, Machine Guns, Mines and lots of speed, Drift, crazy jumps and beautiful graphics, this game will blow you away!

								So you used to play Rollcage? So you used to think you were the bee's knees. So that copper wasn't as good as he thought he was. But look now, you're here. Looking at the store page for what is quite frankly, my most anticipated game ever! I've been waiting for something like this to come along, and in the unreal engine no doubt!The devs are working hard on the game and making it from the ground up, and so far it's looking slick. If you do decide to buy this game (Which I highly reccomend) then join the Discord server, the devs are active on there and will listen to any feedback you may have.I love this game so much, and can't wait to see this through to the end!

								Whoa! You've got the makings of a good game here. Never played the original Rollcage, but futuristic racers like WipeOut, F Zero, Extreme G, etc. have always been faves. Grip along with RedOut are two great discoveries that take the genre into HD. The gameplay is very good although it is too easy to get hung up on stuff which can be frustrating. I guess I just need to play more and get better!Now we just need a deep career mode a la Redout and some more tracks. What's here is really fun. Kudos. Money well spent.			",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is still in early access, and it shows. I recommend it because I think the game has shown enough already to warrant buying it, although it's far from extensively playable. The maps/levels that are playable are magnificent, and a perfect throw-back to the times of Rollcage 1 and 2. If you feel like a fast, hectic racer with amazing SPLIT-SCREEN multiplayer, buy it and don't look back.			",272,83,13,35,43,2,66

								YES, I recommend it, but NO don't buy it yet! It's too early (access). ;)This is the spiritual sequel to Rollcage, and it seems that they are getting it absolutely crazy right. If they keep things up, this is possibly going to the best update to an old game that at least I've ever seen. The graphics are absolutely drop dead gorgeous and all the ingredients seem to be there... it just just needs to stew for a few more months.This is the most fun high speed arcade racing you can get outside of the Wipeout series of games, only this is crazier, with racing upside down and so much weapon carnage that you can go from first to last and back again within the span of a single lap.But right now, you can't control the menus with the gamepad, resolution support is rather finicky, the controls need to be tweaked and there's no online multiplayer component, which they absolutely need to nail.

								I pop back and race this once in a while, and hope to dedicate a bit more time soon. Bit of a fan of the original Rollcage, even if I did find it tricky. This game has a futuristic cool very much like Wipeout, another favourite of mine. If anything this is cooler, with its grungy electro, DnB sountrack.Since I last played, the control feels tighter, and more responsive. Although you can still easily take off and seemingly spend an age in the air. I think the vehicles could use more weight to bring them down when airborne. Also air control.... Let go of the gas and steer left or right. Ok, and what does that do? I have yet to notice it doing much at all. Once airborne you can pretty much kiss that lap goodbye in a lot of cases.I do like the fact this game rewards a more careful use of braking and acelerating than some arcade racers, and the handrake will be something I have to decide to use now and again. It is a game that rewards mastery of its precise controls. That being said, they may alienate some people looking for a more instantly pleasing racer. So in these early stages it is playable and improving, if not exacty innovating in any way. Maybe that is a gamble they don't want with this first ""Grip"", but I hope it is popular enough for a sequel which experiments with the weaponry and tracks and adds something new to the mix.. It is fun, and stylish. Maybe it could steal a few moves from Rocket League, in terms of meanouvering in the air with a fip or something. I feel more in control in that game in such a situation. All in all though, I have high hopes for this game, and it brings back fond memories of an era of gaming that has faded somewhat.			",90,10,23,4,10,3,17

								Simply put, this game is fun as hell if you're into this type of racer- face paced, high octane and (potentially) competitive. It can be a blast on its own, but does become a little repetitive, at least at this stage in development. Truly, this game has a lot of potential. However, there are issues that are in needing of resolution in order for it to become a fully fleshed Rollcage homage. This is understandable due to the fact that it -is- just pre-alpha. Though even at this stage, the game is pretty fun. That and the music is sick. It really fits, y'know? I'd definitely recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Superb game. The reason why this game is so cool, is because there are very few games using this concept. What you basically do is move with supercars that can move at insane speeds. After you reach exterme speed, it becomes really interesting. The game also has some powerups and weapons that allow you to disable opponent. Currently there's no online, but it's coming. Split screen however is already in the game.The only bad thing is performance right now which seems a bit off, but it's playable and should be better by the time the game is finished. Developers are also very active on forums, and release content patches fairly often.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AT CURRENT STATE!			",263,91,15,25,10,3,30

The spiritual successor to the brilliant 'Rollcage'  GRIP is bringing old-school style combat racing back with a bang.

								I'll admit, right now in Early Access, this isn't the most feature packed game ever (which would definitly be expected). But with great graphics, good pace and awesome action, GRIP has a LOT of potential. If the devs care about it as much as they have been already throughout developement (unlike other games *cough *cough *Dayz *cough), this is going to be one hell of a game in the future. So support the devs right now, so they can get working on release, and have fun with it in the mean time.			",89,3,6,6,10,1,0

								UPDATE: Had a run with the new update, and the changes are welcome. I would also like to say at least from what I see I think I can see the potential of where this game could be headed. From the looks of it could be Split/Second meets Wipeout HD/Fury from PS3, and if that's the case I like it even better. Only say that because they have destructible environments at least from what I saw from one of the stages. In my opinion if they expand on that even more than might be good, not advocating they make planes crash out of the sky etc, but it's at least a really good thing they got going. For as little time as I've spent with this game. It's insanely fun it might be Pre-Alpha, but I can tell this game has a LOAD! of potential as someone else said talking Rocket League here. I never played the other game other reviewers are talking about, but I'm interested in doing that now. Only thing I can say compared to other games in Pre-Alpha state you can take the plunge on this one, and shouldn't be disappointed with what there is to offer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Fast. very fast. or impossibly fast. Been playing a couple races every night after work since i bought this. The soundtrack is excellent and is a reason to play the game on its own. the music goes brilliantly with the pace and setting of the game. The tracks seem to be being made with the dual sided car in mind, so many little short cuts, spinning round in a tunnel reminiscent to the death star run. It increases the intensity and thrill of the gameplay , and i find my head pulling to the side with the car from time to time admiring the round and round physics. Initially, there were lots of bugs , lack of barriers etc leeading to getting stuck in the map edge, that kind of thing. First update I've witnessed today addressed quite a few bugs, added new car with very different handling to the first one, a nice change, new music, seems slightly smoother to play.In summary its still very early days, but having original team members from the rollcage games in play is telling, they pushed this game even when the kickstarter failed apparently ( if id heard there was a rollcage reboot kickstarter it wouldnt of failed) and im sure their passion for this project will tell, as its already looking and feeling great for an early stage game.

								Not a bad game (so far) I just finished my first race and am ""miledly"" impressed. This game still needs work. I'll have a more detailed review once I get used to the game. If you are wondering if you should buy this game now, I would wait till they get the carrier mode up. I purchased this game to support it's development. And I've only played this game once. So far, it's OK.Update:Their are 5 modes of solo play and a two player mode. I haven't tried the 2 player mode but their is no online multiplayer mode (yet). Their are 12 cars to choose from, 6 Dominator and 6 Dreadnaught. The Dominators have more speed and less armor, wile the Dreadnaughts have more armor, less speed.Available game modes:Races: A standered racing mode, choose between two available tracks. Place 1st to win.Elimination:If your last, you loose. Deathmatch:Use weapon pick-ups to destroy the other players. (This mode realy could benifit from online multiplayer).Playground:Drive around collecting power up icons. A good place to practice handling your car. Time Trial:Beat you own time each lap. (What did you expect)What needs improving (IMO).Online Multiplayer in Races, Elimination, and Deathmatch. Use Playground as a stunt run and rack up points towards Steam goals.Hidden cars and tracks.I hope the developers are reading this. And I hope you, the Steam community, found this review helpfull. If you're looking in to buying this game now, I would only buy it to support it, otherwise, their's not that much to hold you over. For now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								TL;DR: It has incredible promise to be Rocket League on steroids. For a game that tries so hard to be a 'Distance' reskin, GRIP is an early access that may be hard to recommend. The lack of air control, and steering sens being hard to find, this game is hard to love. There is no sense of ""god damn im going fast"" other than the engine revving with a deep bass and your tailpipe flaring, but thats only when youre in the last 3 spots and have ""catch up"" turned on. The tight maps (with the exception of the wide open jungle track thats still in early alpha as of now) are hard to navigate when you do get up to speed or have other racers around you. The collision in the game is made even worse due to the lack of air control or any kind of function to knock other drivers out of the way. If youre going anything above 300mph and hit even the slightest rock or a hair on another racers tire, expect to do go in a random direction with no chance of recevery except resetting your vehicle onto the track.However...even with all of these flaws, the game has the makings of an incredible release. Since the top hitting racing (car) games are Rocket League and anything involving Grid or Dirt Rally and, as mentioned above, Distance; this brings a refreshing 'grit' to the genre. It has the octane feeling of Rocket League, the cumbersome yet tolerable controls of Grid and Dirt, and the scifi thrill of Distance. I would very highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to jump in early on a game that could potentially be a heavy hitter in the racing scene. It needs improvement, but what early access doest?			",205,19,5,21,12,1,4

Early Access Review
								This is one intense racer.Kart/combat racers remain one of my favourite, and sadly underrated, genres. This particular game lets you drive an armed jet-fueled car that can drive upside down and stick to walls and ceilings across alien planets at speeds exceeding 600km/h, all the while accompanied by the most adrenaline pumping music I've ever heard. That has to sound cool to you. It's obvious that this game is far from being finished with a very small map selection (only 1 map is actually finished, the others are in varying stages of completion) and dozens of features listed on the site not being done yet. However, the product is recieving pretty frequent updates and the price point is very reasonable.As far as gameplay goes this plays like a very fast arcade racer, with its twist being that the cars have no up or down and have no problem driving on walls and ceilings. There's not much else to be said since the game really only has the basics down, and even those aren't perfect yet, but if you're as much of a fan of these types of games as I am you can take the gamble. It's not a lot of money. If you are just regular excited I'd wait with this game, it's far from done and no-one can tell if it'll ever be good. I have faith in the developers and I really hope they can make this game as cool as they promise, but that promise is no guarantee. If were you I'd wait until this game is a little further in development at least, because at the moment it really is in rough shape, but I'd definitely keep an eye on this game because it is promising to be a really damn good one.Oh I just read that they'll be increasing the game's price gradually over time, so you could invest now and get a good deal in return. No-one know what the final price will be but I'm guessing around the 25-30 dollars, so keep that in mind. My reccomendation remains to wait a little longer and buy this game when the basics are solid, so you can both get a decent deal and have decent confidence.			",205,36,3,11,14,4,15

								**UPDATED FIRST IMPRESSIONS:**Fist let me make this clear that I writing this review based on a limited test play.  Also that my views are based on that fact that I wanted this game to be NEXT RollCage.  It had such a great start a year ago when I first looked  at it.   The vehicle and driving characteristics was spot on.  The fun and the edge of the seat racing was what it was all about.  Check out my first impressions back then:

Then a year later I was told that this has been updated, more cars, more tracks and a huge overhaul.  I fired the puppy up and this is what I got after these major updates:

			Views: 0		



From my first impressions this has now been turned into a Mario Kart style racing game?  Gone are the edge of the seat driving physics and in most cases the fun.  Its a £11.99 game and its been in early dev for a year.  Nothing bad about that.  But only a couple of new tracks, no default online multiplayer, still no menu pad controls.  Again, its early access and I understand that.  But for the price this is being sold I got to judge it on what else I can get in that price range.   Looking back at some of the games released a year ago, many AAAs, some awesome Indies and at the moment this is falling well short.  Not to mention some of the great titles released cheaper and in some cases FREE?It has the promise to be so much.  To take the mantle of the best racer in this genre.  But in this latest update the handling has been nerfed, none of the promises of the Multiplayer have come, basic menu controls missing.  Its transformed everything that made Rollcage a hit and replaced it with Mario Kart.Its not a bad game, its just not the game it wanted to be right now.  But for the price and what has been done int he space of a year I cannot recommend this game :(  I hope that things do change and I can do another one of these videos.  But for now it looks like this is going to be deleted from my HDD for another year until the next ""update""*JUDGED FROM THE 15 MINUTES I GAVE IT, ITS NOT A REVIEW ITS MY FIRST IMPRESSIONS*			",509,110,30,34,42,4,66

								I was hopeful that the claim of improved handling in the latest 1.0.10.1 would finally make this game playable, but to no avail.  A beautiful game like this with horrible friction/traction/yaw issues.   The traction of all surfaces feels like driving on ice.   The whole fun of driving is completely destroyed by making the user completely involved in battling over/under corrections dreading every turn no matter how small having the potential to put you into a spin.  Any airtime usually ends in disaster, never being able to properly plant the landing without spining around.  Forget any small bumps or dips in a turn, those will spin you.   This is a big deal since it makes you drive self conciously trying purposfully not to steer at all.  SO DISAPPOINTED since the latest patch seems to tout that thie current model is what they are ""striving for"".. If that's the case, I'm not playing this frustrating game anymore, sorry.

								I'll update this Review if I change my mind, but the first impression was devastating. You rarely have to take your finger off the acceleration button, only small direction-corrections are enough to stay on the track. Brakes, you don't need them, it seems. It's pretty much all about fighting your contrahents (with about 2 weapons and 2? kinds of mines and a shield). I can't believe how this game scored so well in the community. It's one of the most boring racers I've played. Looking back to the F-Zero games this can't compete at all imho. Sorry.Edit: from the comments the developer stated: ""It's true, the game goes fast and you can hold the accelerator most of the time. Right now it's more about precision movements and holding the best racing line, narrowly missing objects on the track while avoiding fire from opponents.""It's a pretty accurate description, I agree with everything. The things I miss in this game are: -) having more challenging courses so that you have to brake/decelerate more often-) having a higher penalty for leaving the racing lineI guess it's best to try it first, Steam offers a refund-option if you aren't sure if it's the game for you. I took that option, maybe others won't.			",62,9,2,13,5,0,9

								My initial impressions on this one:- maps/tracks/scenery/vehicles are all artistically (graphics wise), very nice to look at- track layouts are refreshingly varied & interesting to race on but as of this writing have too many obstacles causing collisions in places and at times when things should be getting fun- very little content (maybe 2 or 3 good finished tracks to race on and a couple of lower quality work-in-progress tracks)- no progression, no content to unlock- mostly poor sound engineering... not exactly a party for your ears until a rocket flies over-head- a few wonky physics issues still to be worked out- low budget, understaffed title where progress has proven to be on the slow side- communicative devloper who often makes himself available right on the Steam forum to answer questionsOverall you can see & feel the potential here...the experience right now in-car can swing back & forth however between exhilarating/fun to confusing/frustrating. Mostly fun, however at this point in time there isn't enough content here to keep you playing.I'd say even though it's been out now for nearly a year, that this Early Access title is still  a little TOO early and probably should have started it's life as a Kickstarter instead of EA.  You might be best to wait awhile longer to see how things progress over the next 6-12 months. It's definitely worth keeping an eye on.*It's saving grace is it's currently low price tag...but you'll get what you paid for in this case, IMO.**EDITED 3 MONTHS AFTER PURCHASE - still no new maps/tracks. In a game where it's success or failure will rely 99% upon it's tracks, the only 1 or 2 GOOD tracks you are given to race on here is simply not enough for it to succeed. It's as if Instead of the author reinvesting his EA funds back into the game by hiring talented map makers he decided to just buy himself some fudge.Wasted potential, time to move on... game in it's current state needs to be FREE...and author needs to change his business model and start charging for lots of new DLC tracks. That is the only real road to success for a game like this.			",51,2,11,1,9,0,1

Early Access Review
								I never played Rollcage, the game this one is a spiritual successor to, but the general concept seems fun and has a lot of potential to me, which is why I decided to pick it up in Early Access. I quickly lost all desire to play after a handful of races. If you're looking into this game, it likely means that you already know what the positives are of the game currently, which is just the core idea behind it (It also looks nice, for what it's worth). Because of that, I'll only be discussing the negatives and why I don't think it's worth spending money on right now for most people.The handling feels very sensitive to me. It's possible that it's just a thing that takes some time to get used to, but in a game where you need to fit your car into tight spaces and are driving down small corridors, I feel like it screwed me up a few times. Related to that, is the camera, which can shift wildly while your car flips or turns and sometimes lingers in an awkward position, making you feel the need to tilt your head just to keep up. It's unbelievably jarring, and I found myself getting completely lost in tunnels and ending up going the wrong direction by the time I got myself oriented again. The last problem that I have with the game is that it punishes you for being in the air by making landing cleanly very difficult. Very often, your car will lose control once it hits the ground again, which seems like a really poor decision to me in a game that's so arcadey and encourages you to do crazy stuff such as jumping off of ramps.The game also seems to have some optimization issues and is missing some key features for its options menu, but I don't see these as huge negatives since it is indeed an EA game.Overall, I found this game to be pretty frustrating, and I think that would be the average gamer's impression of the game if they were to play it in it's current state, which is why it's very hard to recommend at the moment. I'll definitely be keeping an eye on this game in hopes that they make some key changes to the game so that I'll want to buy it again once it officially releases.			",137,18,2,6,11,3,17

								I have to say I am pretty dissapointed by this game it's way too expensive and to be honest I don't like it at all it gets boring very fast and the idea contributions up to now were totally ignored including mine that I've put a hard work constructing.Multiplayer still isn't there after all this time and you run out of stuff to do it was fun for about the first 10 hours I would love to recommend this game but at the current stage don't waste your money on this and get a different game maybe trackmania nations it's free and on steam with players to this day. The original game on the PS1 was better was greater and this game hasn't even the features of the previous edition. In all honesty I doubt any more development, hopefully though they're collecting ideas because that's what would made this game great just now don't buy this and follow up to date reviews to get a better overview of this game.

								This game has good bones. The potential is great and I can definitely see this thing taking off... When it gets more polished. The gameplay currently is fun, fast, but also extremely different. The cars go upwards of 300mph which is awesome! But this also means that the cars tend to fly off the course very easily. It's also impossible to control yourself in midair which is something that I've grown accustomed to from plahing Rocket League. I feel like adding in an air-control feature as well as either changing the mechanics of the stages or closing them in a bit to have a more compact feel would drastically improve gameplay. I am very excited to see how this game progresses but until some of the weirdness is worked out, I would say hold off.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								REVIEW UPDATE BELOW!!!!Hey, i really like to say that i recommend this game because i loved Rollcage back on playstation. I know that GRIP is in an early state, so i hope they work on the physics and especially the behavior from the ""cars"". My personal problem is that it feels like you drive on the moon. For example, if you drive over a little stone, your car will feel like it was a ramp or something. If i drive straight ahead and like to get a little to the right, the car floats and feels not controllable. There are times were i think i have a good controll over the game , and its enjoyable, but then comes ONE little thing and it feels like your car is totally out of controll and fly around and chaos! I am not the best racing game player but i think that THIS game works better if the controlls a more ""arcade"" then phiscally TOO correct or like an simulation. SO lets make it short. Game looks awesome ! Soundtrack very very cool !!!Really great ideas of gamemodes and tracks !......Controls ( Steering, behavior etc.) is NOT GOOD!!!!!......I wish they work on the Problem and i hope i am not the only one with this Problem. Also i wish that they maybe make some old rollcage courses into the new style :) !I dont know if i should give thumbs up or down now, cause its just ONE thing that isnt good on this game. But this ONE  is the most importantly thing! I choose thumbs down. But keep in mind that if they fix that one thing, it will become my new favourite of all racing games :) !!! (sorry for my bad english!)REVIEW UPDATE 25.DEC.2016WOW . This is what i call an update!! Now the game is much much better and makes more fun. It is not perfect now but you can play it and have a really good time. I now can recommend this Game to you if you like fast and futuristic racing games. Grip is not a simulation game and i like it ! its action, fast, fun, drumnbass !!! you should play it :) !!			",76,16,1,5,1,0,3

								Did you enjoy Rollcage 1999 or WipEout 2097 back in the day?Then this is the game for you. Even in its early-alpha state, the game is the most awesome racing game i have played sinceWipEout 2097 on the PS1 as a kid.This game hits all the Old-school style combat racing game nails and inject it with few more million polygons.It's biggest drawback is that there is no multiplayer yet(only 2p local split screen atm), as the game is now i will rate it 8/10. with multiplayer in the future its easily 10/10 from me.PS: Using a controller is advised			",230,26,5,49,25,2,56

From what I've played, Grip has taken most of its inspiration from Firebugs, or Rollcage 3, which I like personally.

								Just bought the early access to the game and had fun with it for at least an hour.Small time to judge but I think first impressions are the ones that weight the most.Being an hardcore fan of Rollcage I was super stoked to find that someone was making a game in the same racing style, I played Rollacage and Rollcage stage II till nausea, and I still have them both in original boxes, and managed to play them on win 7. Now I am on win 10.So to the game:. Graphic is stunning, UT engine is really doing his job at full force here and I played the game at maximum graphic level.. Music fits perfectly the game pace and puts you in the right mood of futuristic races, I really felt like going back to the good ol wipeout 2097 or Dethkarz (anybody here who played it? that was incredible!). Concept is really well done, I loved the different ambientations of the three tracks I could race into. This is very important because a player really need to have in mind the world where the track is located and to have a clear idea of it, I mean ""this is snow track, this is jungle track that is desert, etc etc"". Cars: that's where I would have to point something: I think it would be good to have more differentiation in cars, maybe on the aesthetics but most of all in stats. I was searching for car stats!!! (acceleration, grip, top speed, etc) More car identity please!. I couldn't really understand the difference between the two leagues, except for car being a little more ""tanky"". Playabilty: difficulty is not a problem, but car control it is. I know we are talking about a ""scrambled eggs"" race type game, but I played Rollcage a lot, in GRIP if you lose control of the car it's a bit more difficult to regain it.Except for this this is a race game I was hoping to find and I am really glad it's in the making (and it's still in Alpha!)So if you like the genre and you come from millions of hours of race with rollcage, dethkarz, wipeout like me, keep an eye on GRIP cause it really may be the present day futuristc race game we always wanted.

Early Access Review
								Even in early access this is really fun to play! Years ago I spent hours playing Rollcage and now GRIP totally brings that memories back to me. I can really recommend this game to everyone who likes fast paced (combat) racing, and I hope and wish the developers will lead it to successfull full release ;)			",14,0,2,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Great game so far, excited for future updates. Some detail: While the menu looks like it came straight out of every 2006 Racing game ever, and the controller support is seemingly broken (at least for me, No DS4 support, doesn't work with an Xinput Wrapper, doesn't work with an Xbone controller either) and there isn't any online multiplayer; (yet, though I'm sure that's planned) The game is still fun. Gritting my teeth through the steering with the keyboard and it's not so bad. (I'd be a lot happier if I could change the default controls, but that hasn't been programmed yet either.) The racing is fast and fun, it's all I've tried so far because I love it so much. They really mastered the sense of speed. I'm not sure how I feel about the air control, since I haven't found a way to counter getting sideways in air (even letting off the acceleraction like the loading screen says.) But otherwise, it's a smooth gameplay experience with lots they could build on. The power ups are cool as hell, and I imagine they'll look even better with higher resolution models. Anywho, I'd pick it up now if you want to waste some time and to look forward to future updates, otherwise; wait until it has more features you want.			",134,32,7,9,23,2,14
