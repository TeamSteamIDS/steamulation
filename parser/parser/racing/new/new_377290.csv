												I have been playing this game for the last hour after purchasing it on sale at a silly cheap price.I read the other reviews before purchasing, they are currently few and mixed.  Somebody mentioned that it has too many keys, it doesn't have many at all, and you can view them at any time by clicking the question mark at the bottom.The AI is different, but not in a bad way, the drones hide, pop out to attack, run away etc.  I think it works well for the type of game.The mentioned issue with the level not auto restarting, not sure if this has changed, but it sends you straight back to the level select screen, at which point you are one click from restarting the level, or choosing a different one if you desire, seems fine to me.Difficulty may be an issue for some, I'm an old school gamer who misses the days when games actually provided a challenge, and this does.  The game is well balanced though, stick with it and I'm sure you will get the hang of it, just requires learning a few simply techniques, after which the game takes on a whole new lease of life, fantastic!I cannot recommend this game more, think Paradroid 90 with a dark atmosphere, and without the takeover minigame.  Graphics and audio are perfect for the type of game.This dev deserves a lot of credit for the game, I'm so glad I found it !   If it is your thing then buy it, enjoy it, and please give positive reviews if you do.  It annoys me that four out of the eight reviews I can see are not recommending this game, half of them, WHAT !!!!			",1017,372,50,93,92,12,157

												Simple but decent idea, however the game requires super human reflexes. The second you see a single pixel of the enemy they are already moving and shooting at you. Restarting a level is clunky and takes to long.			",25,10,1,4,2,0,2

												Don't be fooled by the simplistic visage of Biodrone Battle.  Underneath its  surface there are a gauntlet of challenging levels and smart enemies to test your skill.PROS:+ The ""morphing"" mechanic-adds another element to the twich shooting mechanics of the typical top-down shooter, and makes into more of a tactical affair.  Tactical in the sense that you get 3 slots to fill with drones that have different strengths and weaknesses, which can be employed in different situations.  It also presents more than one way to advance through levels, as you are limited by the amount of energy and must mix fighting and morphing to survive.  Gameplay with each drone takes on a different tone, as the special powers of each as well as their speed, range, and attack power make + The challenge-This game will test your reflexes and ability to play offense and defense at the same time.  Many enemies are relentless (see below), and often a single mistake will prove fatal.  This in turn makes every victory immensely gratifying, as it is not simply a matter of figuring out the exploits and taking advantage, but being faster and smarter than the machine, which falls right in line with the game's narrative.+ The A.I.--Enemy drones react like human players.  They don't sit still or wander into traps, and it takes some cleverness on the part of the player to dupe an enemy drone into a corner.  Enemies also utilize their strengths--a long range Sniper will evade and create distance where it can pick you off from offscreen, a Maintenance drone will repair its stronger comerades and skate away before you can destroy it.  Enemy drones know when they're losing--they'll retreat, recharge, regroup, and attack again with strength.+ Classic gameplay--Underneath all the fancy bloom effects and explosions, it's still a classic shooter at its core.  The non-linear level design allows you to go to higher levels and attempt to morph into high-level bots, but this of course comes with the risk of one-shot kills.  The risk-reward factor is seen throughout the action and decision making.CONS:-As mentioned, the game is hard.  Unless you're of legendary hand-eye-coordination, be prepared for multiple retries of the same level.  Be prepared to destroy every enemy except one on a tough level, only to be destroyed by the last enemy because your hand slipped off the mouse, and having to do it all again.  The difficulty isn't necessarily punishing, but may scare away gamers looking for a casual experience. ",1,4,0,2,0,1,1

												I like games with a retro feeling, though I do not play originals because I think they were great at their time but fall back compared with modern retro games. Biodrone Battle took my interest because Paradroid was one of my favorite games and I think this is a nice remake. It it faster, got more action (as far as I remember) but also has its moments of tension when you got chased by a droid, escape into another room, hide and watch your confused haunter. Graphics is somewhat basic or retro-like but lights and explosions give a tense ambience.			",3,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Intense, fast-paced action.  This game is hard in a Hotline Miami sort of way -- you die  a lot , but the only penalty for death is that you have to try again.  There's a lot of variety in level design, enemy AI, and strategy.			",61,10,0,3,4,0,3

												The game is kinda bad. It is hard to understand what really to do, it is not very well specified, and you may die to quick in this game. When you're trying to morph, it is also hard to get what you need to do. The soundtrack is good, though, but you don't really buy a game for its soundtracks. Nothing in this game seems really that great, so you should probably avoid it, although it is not horrible.			",1078,435,19,150,102,11,152

												I really tried to give a chance for this game, but it had no mercy on me. A.I. is very intelligent, maybe even too intelligent from the beginning to enjoy this game. It gives you challenge, it is visually alright and sounds are pretty good, but controls does not always seem to work properly which made me a bit frustrated. Also, if you die, it restarts from the main menu and then you need to select the level again you were playing, which does not make it more enjoyable at all.			",76,15,1,4,10,0,5

												Plough around levels and eliminate enemy robots. Kill them before they kill you, or morph into them before they kill you. That's it really. It looks the part and sounds nice, however the difficulty has been cranked up to 11 which destroys any desire to persist with what is already a rather dull game.			",407,113,12,32,27,1,43

												- AI of enemy is not even close to what you would call ""fair"". Just absurdly cheating difficult. To the point that it's unplayable. The milisecond you are in AI's firing range - they shoot at you. And I personally encountered 2 enemy types that 1-hit kill you - it wasn't fun.- A lot of things that should make sense but don't:As F-1 ""Fighter"" unit you can teleport by pressing space... WHERE TO? No clue. It just teleports me randomly. And to beging with - WHY would you want to teleport? There is no advantage to it whatsoever.""You can morph into enemy..."" no, you can't. Why? No clue. My blue ""morphing sphere"" just gets deflected and blue morphing laser at close range just doesn't show up. There goes my last chance to survive.After dying for 60 minutes straight on each level - I just gave up.I got lured by the 0,24€ price tag (game was on sale), but the game is just worth 0€ at this point. Simply because it's unplayable. You have been warned.I wonder if the dev even play tested his own damn game. Come on.			",121,5,0,6,2,0,6

I would not recommend this game at this price. Maybe for $4.99 or less, but as it is $6.99 is a little steep for what it is. It offers a tough, top down shooter with an interesting ""hacking"" twist where you can completely take over an enemy while instant killing them. Yet still, I cannot recommend this game at this time.Why? Biodrone battle is simple yet frustrating. The enemies are difficult, and the UI leaves something to be desired. This is the first game I have done a 20 minutes of game on that I would not recommend at this point, but it may improve in the future. I will put the video review up here once I get it edited and put up on youtube to further explain my opinion/showcase gameplay, but suffice to say it did not please me very much to play it and I did not have much fun. I did however, give it a fair review of it on 20 minutes of game, and it finaled with a score of 29/60 in my category review system, which actually is fairly decent for a single genre game (categories and respective scores are: Warrior: 7, Creative: 6, Critic: 4, Loremaster: 4, Completionist: 3, and Seeker 5)			",268,55,2,65,13,0,53
