												Just how many Es can you replace with Xes for the title of a video game? Late to the trend of replacing Es with Xes in the title is Xpand Rally Xtreme, a realistic racer that has you competing in off-road rallies and tweaking your car between events. There's a lot of realism here, car damage affects performance and your driver can get injured bad enough that it will end the event. As real as it is, its still fun, easy to play, challenging and a focused experience. Every turn matters, every ding on your vehicle matters. When your co-pilot announces rocks inside, there are major rocks to mess up your car.I'll start with the negatives and you can compare to see if you find them enough to scare you away. The first is this is a race the clock game that has you racing a ghost rather than against real competition. The game is all about your skill to shave seconds off your time through improving yours and your car's performance rather than playing dirty and wrecking the competition. Other than that, the big negative is a freeze frame split second pause  at many junctures through each race. Even with a modern computer that can handle today's games, this decade old game still flinches and freezes here and there. The load times are long, even when loading cars in the dealership to look at.You can set the driving to be manual or automatic for the lazy like me. There's a setting for realistic or arcade, the latter of which gives you trolley controls of forward and reverse rather than the former which forces you to brake, then throw your vehicle into reverse before you can back up. All of these styles play well and you have a respawn button if you stray too far off the beaten path. To add to the realism or arcade fun, there are several different camera angles. Chase, close chase, bumper, hood and even the driver's seat.Xpand Rally Xtreme takes place in Asian countries like Malasia, China and Japan across a few different areas. The career has you participating in blocks of events. Ranking bronze, silver or gold in eight car competition unlocks the next set of events. The events consist of typical races against a ghost, time trials, one-on-one races on closed circuit courses that start one of you at the beginning and the other halfway through the track. There's even a boss fight, which is just a fancy way of saying there's only enough for first place against a single ghost car.The tracks look beautiful and have a glow about them all depending on your graphical settings. You'll tear across dirt, gravel, sand, water and even tarmac or pavement for each event. Areas feel lush with vegetation and I prefer racing in these areas to those with cold concrete covering everything. It just feels more diverse driving over bridges or along  coastlines. I say diverse, but the sad thing is racing three events back to back in the same area feels like a bit much. The courses change routes, but that's about it. They do their best to block off areas with barricades, so by the time you're out of each set of three events, you'll be ready to leave. Each course has a few details to make the environment feel more alive such as animals running in the distance or men in red shirts scurrying across the track. If you hit these guys, you respawn with wasted time as punishment. Its tough to even hit them.The events are meaty enough to get some time investment into them, usually around four to six minutes for the early portion of the game. Terrible drivers will soon feel the bumps and bruises of having a door torn off and having to compensate with your car pulling to one side or the other. Its tough to start losing parts though, because with trees and tape, those make for tough targets to bash into. Its a lot easier to lose parts in races that have walls everywhere.Each of these races gives you cash to spend and the first thing that you'll do is repair your vehicle. Damage is real and it'll cost you, but the choice is yours what to repair and a parentage of just how damaged something is. While everything can be repaired, its the tires that need to be completely replaced. Do you wait until you're at sixty percent or wait for eighty?You need to be wise with your tires and you're given stats on each course how much is tarmac and how much of it is gravel. In fact the game warns you if you're using the wrong type of tire, but the decision is always up to you. It can be a bit click heavy to go through the menus to get where you need to go and then return back.These parts all have specifics. I'd normally call them stats, but these are specific numbers and details that you need to look into when tweaking your vehicle. I just go for the more expensive, the better it is approach. There's just too much here for me, but its here if I want it.You can visit a dealer in the menu that will sell you new vehicles. Some events require specific vehicles that you'll need to buy. Every past event can still be played for more cash, so you will have to grind your way up to earn enough money to purchase a new vehicle or just start selling parts.With everything said, this is a deep game, but more than just the car mechanics. There are a deep set of options. The controls let you rebind keys for everything but the pause menu. You can use a controller with your directional pad or analog stick and even control the dead zone. I went for controlling with the direction pad rather than messing with the dead zone. The only problem here is if you have 360 triggers for your forward and reverse, they are also your up and down in the menu. Otherwise you can always just use the mouse.You can set to have your co pilot warn you, along with icons of upcoming turns and even how far ahead they tell you what's coming. There are even performance settings for the ribbon tape physics. There's always a certain something to being told the direction rather than checking a mini map. It keeps your eyes on the action. If you want to turn off the ghost car, the choice is yours. Xpand Rally Xtreme lets you play the way you want to and I'm happy for that.For anyone that wants it, there's online multiplayer and even LAN support, but with this game being so old, the multiplayer has been dead years ago. There's no split screen either. Heck since you're the only car on the trail, I wonder how they pull off multiplayer. Seeing ghosts of your friends or just seeing their time through each checkpoint.At a mere $5 this decade old game is worth a risk for anyone that enjoys realistic racing. There are performance issues that make it a tough recommendation, but the game is still an enjoyable challenge for a cheap price.			",1120,324,51,104,96,15,167

												Xpansion to Xpand. It is more of the same great gameplay with some seriously insane cars to boot.Tracks are more focused on the arena dirt and Island style racing, and none of the snow races (my favorite).It is an excellent expansion to one of my favorite rally games, and is certainly worth a play if you like Xpand.

												Some people may not like this game, and that's a shame. Yes, it is old, and hard - recommended 1st person driving (which makes it more realistic and much more harder than 3rd person driving that's available among other viewing options) and only ... Rallys (which means you compete, eventually, against the clock), no midgame saving - no room for mistakes. Car models are false, but resemble real life models.But, you can still choose from different cars, you can change the wheels and etc. and adapt the cars to each rally. The difficulty in Arcade mode is pretty easy (well, only at first), while in Simulation the races are very hard since even 1 accident (with a tree or something else on the road) means you lost precious time. All of this makes finishing 1st feelling very rewarding.Help/Spoiler: Advancing is very hard without significantly improving your car. If you find it hard to go on - go back, and race again where you already won - you race against the same drivers with same cars as before, while your car should be improved, and therefor it's much easier to win and get easy money.

												It's an old rally game but............ is Xtreme Good. If you miss the days of Colin McRae Rally this game is  perfect for you.  The only problem , for my, is that the game no licensed cars ; resembling the original cars but with names derived Ex:Peugeot 207 Super 2000 'Lion 2007'; Subaru Impreza WRC 'Kosumo Showdown WRL' ; 2007 Volkswagen Golf 'RV Wolf 524' ; Fiat Punto Super 1600 'Italic PNT 1.6'.Beware on  the damage system of the care because you will need to repair the car; and one more thing  the driver can be injured as well or even worse die in accident resulting in loss of career.If you like old rally games is greate but if you are looking something like Dirt series this isn't for you :)			",328,13,22,17,16,1,22

												this game has great potentail, there is plenty of texure detail ( grass,rocks,trees ect... look great ) and the cars look respectable enough to not have a problem with. The handing model is a bit different but fine to play once you get used to it. There is plenty of game content as well. The massive let down of this game is that the lighting quality is hopeless, the game graphics suffer a lot because of this and just if they had put a bit more time in to it the the game would be so much better. Although saying this for £4 its great fun to mess around with and you can play with your mates or random people online if you wish. mind you if they updated the graphics it would be worth so much more. The final plus point is that it will support really, really low systems on low quality for those not lucky enough to have a good PC.			",24,4,15,0,8,0,0

												For me this is still far the best rally game. I played Dirts, WRCs, but none of them gave me so much adrenaline, feel, and challenge like Xpand Rally did. The only negative could be the missing of the real car brands and WRC stages. I strongly recommend this polish gamefor any sim or racing fan.

												An awful game.Whatever good it has, it's from Xpand Rally, its predecessor. The only thing new to the game is special stages, but they are almost impossible to win fairly. Either your AI opponent will drive into a wall at the beginning, or you will have a very hard time keeping up with him.The regular races are hardly different from XR — well, the US stages are exactly the same. Asphalt physics is still terrible. Winter stages were removed completely — you won't even have to use all your arsenal of different tyres, only two types are needed for most of the game.The AI becomes too strong relatively early in the game, and the only way for me to beat him was to use Cheat Engine to boost money and install all the available upgrades on the stronges car. Or, you could raise the funds without cheating and win previous races over and over, but honestly, this game does not deserve so much of your time. And even with that, the AI is very hard to beat.The developers were so lazy they didn't fix any obvious game breaking bugs, didn't try to improve balance.Even for a decade old, low-budget, aimed at casual crowd rally-themed racing arcade with no licensed cars, it's a terrible game. Do not buy it.			",266,112,27,69,26,0,52

												There are definitely better games to spend $5 on. As something that came as part of a cheap bundle it is a reasonable piece of entertainment. Was a little annoying to manually setup the controls for each button on my Logitech F310 but once that was done it worked well. The graphics are pretty simple but it gets the jobs done. Very akin to the original CMR on the PlayStation which I spent a lot of time playing.Bottom line, throwing a couple of bucks at it isnt a big waste as long as you recognise that it is an older title.

Note: 5/10I was expecting something similar to the first Colin McRae's games... it is not.I have to say that although this 5€ game is good enough for playing casually, it presents three important problems:· In Colin's games, immersion to the world of rallys was brilliant. Here, I don't have the same sensations... a couple of stages, improve a bit the car, maybe buy a new one... and not much else.· No licensed cars.· Decent physics, but not a great simulator.If you like racing games and can find this for less money.......

												Could be an ok rally game, but it seems like it randomly totals your car out on invisible obstacles in the road. One time that stands out to me was going over a bridge on tarmac the car immediately became totalled out, came to a stop, and I was informed that my driver was injured. In this game that requires a ""career rollback,"" much like a system restore on a computer, losing all your progress since your last race series was completed. Also the game crashes when you try and exit, leaving me to do the good old CTRL+ALT+DEL trick to close it and get back to my desktop. I wouldn't recommend anybody to buy this game.			",4,0,5,0,2,0,0

It kept doing that and I went into third person, it was like I was putting handbrake on but I wasn't, endless streams of tire marks... and THE FLIPPING NOISE IT MAKES, The engine sounds SO ANNOYING when it keeps hitting the limiter, it's the most annoying sound ever, even turned down the volume and it was still annoying.  What a CRAP game.  It was fun, I was loving it but MAN did that kill it completely.  Just that endless hitting the limitier bs.

												Xpand Rally Xtreme is a sorta sequel to Xtreme Rally, which is surprisingly realistic, yet saddled with a strange ""campaign"" engine with ""car upgrades"" cribbed from far more ""arcade"" titles that distracts from its realistic car handling and decent terrain engine, ending up with a ""neither fish nor fowl"" that's neither hardcore nor arcade, and really satisfies neither camp. Driving sims generally comes in three flavors: pure arcade (turn and burn rubber) such as NFS Most Wanted, hardcore sim (rFactor), or semi-hardcore (WRC games, GRID series). Xpand Rally Xtreme (and its predecessor Xtreme Rally) tries to bridge the arcade and semi-hardcore with choice between arcade and simulation modes, but the ""campaign"" makes little sense as you have to win money and apply money to repairs and upgrades. Upgrading a rally car, hmmm... Lack of full controller support (i.e. choose menus with controller) makes actually playing less than pleasurable as one must reach for mouse. it also will not auto-detect my standard Xbox360 controller and I had to map inputs manually. There are no real cars. The car physical models are based on the real cars, and you can recognize the cars. However, the names are changed as not to offend the original owners (i.e. Ford = Cord)  and minor body work changed as well. Additional car types are introduced in this game instead of just rally cars, grouped into roughly 4 classes. The rally courses and events are quite decent and long enough (though none of them are super-long). And the cars do handle realistically as they slide and straighten or react to handbrake turns. Driving model is quite good. On the other hand, the setups that you'd expect for rally games, like front vs. rear rollbar, , suspension settings, etc. are hidden via a LOT of icons and such, when they are there at all.  And this is in simulation mode. Furthermore, you start with a budget. Yes, a budget, 35000, to buy one of the 4 starting cars (approx 33000 or 34000). And you get to upgrade parts like suspension, tires, engine, and so on. For a moment I thought I was playing Flatout, as they involve the same sort of parts: regular shocks, sports shocks, pro shocks, racing shocks, for example. You may win thousands per race, but you will have to pay to repair the damages, and if you don't finish near the top (1st or 2nd) your winnings may barely pay for the damages, leaving you going nowhere. Furthermore, the idea of upgrading your car in rally, where everybody should be nearly equal, is a bit ""hmmmm...."".  I wish I can enjoy it a bit more, as I do enjoy rally games, but this game is a bit on the ""weird"" side.  ",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

												I really like XRX and it's brother XPand Rally. So many details that surprise me, as I discover this underrated gem. Some handy ""cheats"" permits us to have access to beautiful places and awesome cars, in an instant. Just look them up on the net. Please type () at the end.Long periods of playing time is not always available for me, to obtain all tracks and cars.Windshiled wipers that wipe realistically, light patterns detailed by quartz halogen bulbs, cars able to run (barely) on 3 wheels, with a spindle scraping, and creating sparkles, ect. I have a run of the mill PC set up, and this thing runs like a Deer, I mean like a dream.I even bought the DVD's of both games, just to own the boxes, artwork, and backup discs just in case...BTW my Logitech F310 is perfect, just choose the appropriate steering components at the garage, the controller sensivity, come's after that first step. Lucky for you outhere, who owns a proper steering wheel and pedals. So long fellow virtual rally pilots.			",10,4,2,0,14,0,0
