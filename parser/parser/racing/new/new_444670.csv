								First impressions are good. Really fun, furious futuristic racing with a brilliant twist. Colourful graphics, great soundtrack, a promising start. The gameplay is tricky without being infuriating. You can ease yourself into the flow of the game with various options that make things a little more forgiving; The AI and tracks have variable difficulty. Create the race you want. What sets this out from other future racers? Procedurally generated tracks, vertical shortcuts and GIANT SPACE BALLS. That's the genius of it. Can't wait to see what's next for the game. *FIRST IMPRESSIONS VIDEO BELOW...*

								Super Impossible Road, a futuristic themed, downhill and procedurally generated racing game.SIR is not like usual racing games, the key that make it's unique from the other racing games is that you need to take a shortcut to win a race. the boundaryless procedurally generated tracks on SIR can really test your creativity on taking a smart good shortcut.SIR is about how race a ball to the bottom of the track, and you are always given the freedom how to reach the bottom as fast as you can, that's such a simple but awesome concept. what i feel from is that this game is very tricky, fast paced and you need to win not only with your speed, but you need more help from your creativity.overall this game is very fun and challenging, it's really worth to keep an eye on this game, i'm very excited to see the game progresses and what can be offer in the future. i'm sure this game got big potential and many people will loves playing this game in the future.i almost forgot to mention that this game has a fantastic physics, without a good physics this game will be less tricky and less fun to play ",87,16,4,10,4,0,9

A futuristic racing game reminiscent of a Tron bike race, coliding with a giant futuristic gumball machine.The splitscreen functionality is a great idea. I miss the old days of having friends over and raging over a game of Mario Kart!!!The Pros:I LOVE cheating!Great GraphicsRequires thinking ahead, and the tracks are randomized every time.Controls are intuitive and easy to learn (I played with a controller)Would make a great party / drinking gameVery fun, and skill pays off.The music is great, although not many tracks.The Cons:(There really arent too many.)Few levels to choose from (I'm sure this will change soon)Bouncing can sometimes be unpredictable, but hey. tough luck, STOP CHEATIN!No online play as of now.Once this game is finished I believe it will be, and should be in every competitive online players arsenal.If you liked this review, Sub to my page! I review all sorts of new games!!! Thanks! =) ",100,18,0,13,10,0,14

			Genna plays Super Impossible Road. A racing game that rewards you for skipping part of the track. Click here to Subscribe ► http://bit.ly/mrwssub...		

You control a very cool looking ball-vehicle-thing and race down a randomly generated track. Tracks are incredibly twisty, turny and bumpy. They remind me of audiosurf tracks, or rainbow road from Mario kart. Racing down these is a blast.Even cooler though, is that you have the ability to roll off of these tracks and skip ahead. Since the tracks are constantly going downwards, you can simply fly off of the edge and land somewhere below. You have a set amount of time to do this, or else you'll respawn back at the last gate you past through. This adds a great risk, great reward mechanic in the game, where skipping ahead could gain you the lead, but not timing the jump properly could cause you to fall behind.There are multiple gates throughout the levels, that once you go through serve as a checkpoint, and will fill your boost meter. You may use this boost while racing down the road, or falling through the air to make sure you land back on the road in time before you respawn.There are a decent amount of game modes to keep you interested.There's the basic racing mode where you can customize the amount of local players, AI difficulty, track length, track complexity and the environment look. There are currently only 2 environments as of the time I'm writing this review. It's not important that there aren't many, as they're completely cosmetic, but I like that the option is there. They give the game a fresh look every new race.There's also a survival mode where you don't get any respawns, and simply try to go as far as possible without dying.The time gate mode has a timer constantly ticking down to zero, and you are required to go through a special type of gate in order to gain some time back. Currently both of those game modes are singleplayer only, so I would really love if more players would be able to play those together in the future.There is a career mode and online mode currently under construction, but I can't comment on them as they aren't available in the current build I'm playing.I'm very happy to see that the game gives you a lot of graphical options to tweak, which is very nice. Sadly, on the other hand the game doesn't control as well as it should with PC controls. Playing the game itself is fine with a controller or keyboard, but the menus are SLIGHTLY frustrating to maneuver. There's no mouse support in the main menu, which can be annoying. I'm hoping the simple stuff like that will be fixed, because I don't really have any problems with the game itself.It's a great idea for a game, well executed, and I honestly can't wait to see the online mode available. The music is some pretty decent techno to get you into the moment, and compliments the look of the world quite well.Overall, it's a really fun, and unique idea for a racing game!

								Super Impossible road is a game with a simple gameplay, but with an amazing gameplay, with multiple game modes that will please those who are competitive or at least like a good challenge. Steeped in both solo and multiplayer game modes (such as location), unfortunately as the game is in early acess many ways are unavailable.offline:- Career: (under construction) - Local race (a ""typical"" race with friends and / or CPU) - Gate time (the goal is to go as far as possible collecting markers and arriving on time at the gate, thus receiving more time to collect more markers, and it ends up not get the next gate - it also releases continued track) - Survival (your goal is simply to get the score, but no time or gate, just this purpose, but makes it difficult is that you can go off the track once (for a long period of time without touching again on the ground) - unlike the gate time that can die as many times as).NOTE: The modes team survival gate and have a global ranking.multiplayer (under construction):- Ranked- unrankedNote: the multiplayer mode is unavailable altogether, so far at least.Before each game mode you can choose the stage and customize the ""vehicle"", but the options are very few. However something that pleased me was the fact that the customization really influence because there are attributes. The number of phases yet = 2However this is only the fact already mentioned in the beginning, but I confess that I am looking forward to playing in new leads. Finally I do not have much to say of the game, besides the fact that it is very fun and addictive.Note: perhaps the clarity of the game may cause you some inconvenience in view, I recommend modifying the graphic settings and general to the point that you are comfortable.Two moments of the game there was a small lock, but barely lasted one second and game time there is an interface error that makes it possible to overlap the start screen on to match screen.Obs²: I probably will go modifying the analysis over time.If you want to challenge me give my statistics to date (ranking):Time Gate Keres: 21 - Athos - not yet playedSurvival Keres: 80 - Athos: - 45For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/ .Also you're welcome to join in the fun in our Steamified group.

Early Access Review
								Much like the iOS game, this is game is inspired by the shortcuts you would find in rainbow road on mario kart. You race down a winding path with no edges and attempt to get down the farthest or the fastest (depending on mode)... to do that youll be flinging yourself off the edges and aiming for the track below to gain a huge advantage. They balance this by allowing you only 5 seconds off the track, meaning you have to pick your shortcuts carefully.This game is VERY early access at the time of this review, with online multiplayer and career mode being absent. The modes and local multiplayer it does offer though I do feel justifies the price. Survival mode is much like the iOS orginal in that you are just trying to get the farthest down the hill,  speed isnt a factor. This mode is great for high score challenges with friends. Racing mode is a new addition, and like the name suggests youre racing down a predetermined length course against ai or local opponets. When online multiplayer is completed I expect this to be the main mode I play. And time atack mode, which has you going through gates every 10 check points to gain more time to go farther. In my opinion this mode goes against the spirit of the game but it does offer an interesting challenge as the check points get farther and farther away. All in all its far superior to its iOS counterpart, the controller support alone accomplishes that. A game where you spot your landing like this just doesnt work great when youre tilting your screen around. At 8 bucks I feel like there is enough there right now to justify the purchase, but waiting for updates and a sale may be your best bet if you arent sure from the trailer and this review.

Early Access Review
								Early Access review:  Will edit as updates come out.TLDR:  Currently a fun single player as well as couch co-op timekiller with a reasonable price tag.Bored and reading comments version: Super Impossible Road or SIR as the devs and I call it, is a little idea with big potential.  Current Cons:  Limited to 3 roads and only a couple songs, online multiplayer and career are not currently in game.Whether the idea to make a racing game about cheating was an accident or a stroke of genuis remains a mystery.  What I do know is that it's freaking fun.  I was the kid no one liked to play Mario Kart with becasue I always focused on the chincy spots to use boosts and cut across as much track as possible.  Now its not just an exploit, its the principal mechanic.  Falling off the track and landing 50 feet ahead may not sound like much, but when you get 5 seconds of freefall that refreshes every time you so much as graze the track, magic can happen.  Granted this is a curse as much as it is a blessing.  Without passing through gates to progress your respawn point, an incredible run ruined by one bad bounce can send you back to the starting line and irredemably far behind.  That's just the thing too, bouncing can and will happpen, and mastering it can be tricky.  Sometimes you bounce straight up and time out just hovering there, other times you get pitched impossibly far to the side where the road simply isn't.Then there's the tension, and feeling of panic.  Much like hearing the warning of Mario Kart's blue shell which puts your blood on ice, seeing an opponent fall ahead of you and skip 30 gates is terrifying.  Suddenly your killer lead has evaporated and you need to start getting risky to catch up.  You take jumps where you normally wouldn't, you expend your boost trying to keep up only to blackout and respawn.  Disheartened you look at your position and realize it still says 1st.  This is a frequent occurence, just because they passed you, doesn't mean they're ahead of you.Couch co-op gets competitive as hell cause you can see when your friends are taking jumps and you start reading their path to see if they can catch you.  Races are short enough too, unless you dial up the distance and complexity of the course so rotation of players usually isn't an issue.  If you don't have local friends, beating thr AI is plenty of fun, and there's a survival mode with leaderboards that are frankly insane.When online multi happens along with the career, this game is going to become huge, at least I hope.  A dedicated dev with a great idea, I'd hate to see it fall flat.All this is bundled with a sweet soundtrack and stunning visuals.			",168,19,1,12,19,1,28

								A swirling descending track, gentle blue checkpoints, all suspended in an empty space with some balls racing downwards, thirsting for first. The thing is, this victory will only come by cheating.I have a certainty that the developers from WONDERFUL LASERS lost a lot of races when they were younger children, this thinking comes to light because of the way you have to play Super Impossible Road in order to win. It’s a race, but it isn’t a race where you just overtake the opponents, this is a race where you jump corners…literally. This game does what RED CARD did for Football games, takes the structure and standard conventions from a genre, and demolishes it with pure insanity.As I write this preview, the game is still in Early Access, so as you’d expect game modes are limited, features are buggy, and crashes are likely – although despite this the game has a wondrous charm about it, and not only that, it’s really rather polished up. The main intro screen dresses the game up as exactly what it is, a pick-up-and-play arcade racer. The image above is what it looks like, and I’m pretty sure you’ll agree with me in saying that this type of title screen could be seen in an airport or dock arcade. Already, from this screen alone, it’s obvious to see that accessibility, and approachability are two core strives of the game.Read the rest. http://bigbossbattle.com/preview-super-impossible-road/ ",163,30,5,11,15,0,7

At this price of $8.50 it's ok to buy it but the game itself feels empty, there is so much stuff to be added and that's why this is on Early Access. Things like more sound effects and music (main menu doesn't have music), an exit button (you have to press alt+f4 to close the game). Everything else it's good, the game just came out a few hours ago and I really wanted to buy this. Online multiplayer it's coming soon so you should buy it to practice the mechanics of the game.

I also cannot wait for the release of online play which is a feature I so wished existed in the original game.

								Can't say that the game is bad, but.. I see those bad points, without pros.-A race game where we can't slow down. Don't tell me it's because it's early access, that's a basic thing that would have been added at least before the boost if they wanted to.- The shortcuts, said 'epic' in the game description, are actually shortened by their reset mechanic : if you fall for too long, you get a forced return on the track to your original position. It kills the whole point of this game, imo. The game is still early access so there isn't much to do yet, or to comment about. A single track race, a daily track and split-screen.

								Amazing game that is both brutally punishing the more you try and ""cheat"" the game, if you fail. But the more you cheat, the more you win. It is really good. Support this game, it is worth the full price.Also realize that currently in the time of writing this review, I have only about 3 hours in the game, however I have started about 80-150 races (from reseting and the fast paced cheating of this game). This game is both for casuals and hardcore players and if the community grows larger, this game would be an amazing competitive tourney game.			",51,8,0,5,1,0,7

								I write this review as the game is still in Early Access. I say that not because I plan to go easy on the game or something, just as a heads up to those that will consider buying the game. I've always maintained that ""Early Access"" is not an excuse for how good or bad a game is. Once you put it on the marketplace, you're fair game... in my opinion. Super Impossible Road is a racing game. There's really not much to say about racing games in general. You control a ball. You can modify your ball to have the stats that you want it to have but let's be real here, does anyone ever care enough to min-max perfectly? If you do, please send me a message, I need to know what's going on in your head. The tracks have gates on them which fill up your boost bar. Using boost makes your ball go a little faster (obviously). Where this game differs from other racing games that I've played is that you can jump off the track to ""cheat"" your way to finish line faster. That's why the game's tagline ""Winning is cheating"". Now you can't just jump off the track and free fall to the finish line for victory. The game would be too easy in that case. Upon leaving the track, you have five seconds to return to the track. If you fail to touch the track in that time, you will automatically respawn at the last boost gate you touched. Which means that you have to be really careful about deciding when to 'cheat'. Otherwise you may waste up to five seconds. If you see the writing on the wall that you're not going to make it, you can force respawn early.The tracks can be fairly complex. At this time, while there are only three 'tracks', the tracks are procedurally generated so it's like having an infinite number of tracks? There's also a daily track where you can compete with people across the world for the top score.The game is aesthetically appealing (to me) with that 'Tron' feel. I'm not the biggest fan of EDM so there's only one or two soundtracks that I like but it definitely matches the feel of the game. Excellent job. While the game does have multiplayer, it seems it only has local multiplayer. Perhaps they will change that as it is still in early access. You can still have CPU racers and you can even race against your ghost. So it has some rudimentary tools.Anyway, at the time of writing, the game is priced at $12. While I do like the game for what it does, I don't think it's worth $12 yet. Do it if you want to support the creators but other than that, I'd wait for it to go on sale or something for $5 or $6. I'm not the biggest fan of racing games so I won't dump too many hours into it, but in my opinion, it does look promising.			",210,80,2,48,32,1,23

Early Access Review
								This game really does need online multiplayer...really good concept but is open to so much more if online is accessable.			",153,11,15,5,9,1,9
