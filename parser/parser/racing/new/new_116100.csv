												Super Toy Cars feels like a game that escaped out of early access with a reassuring smile and a lot of fundamental issues unaddressed.As I was playing through it I kept having to double check that it was indeed fully released and not still undergoing development, with so many prevalent bugs and a general lack of basic racing necessities popping up as if I had somehow been slipped a beta build in place of the final game. But Super Toy Cars is indeed ""finished"", or at least unlikely to receive any major future updates, so we're left with the game we've been given and it's a rather disappointing end result to something that started off with such promise.Super Toy Cars wants to occupy a space between kart racers and somewhat more realistic arcade racers, with the handling and track designs of the latter and the zany power-ups and silliness so often associated with the former. In reality it adheres almost entirely to traditional arcade racing, with the inclusion of power-ups being rather unnecessary and pretty useless on the whole. There was rarely an instance where launching a missile or dropping an oil spill gave me any noticeable advantage, occasionally being a slight annoyance but usually something I forgot was even there.I think a lot of this though has to do with how spaced out racers inevitably get over the course of a race. After the first lap I would often be so far behind or ahead of everyone else that there wasn't any chance I'd be able to hit someone with a power-up even should I want to, and even in the rare instance I was in the middle of the pack it so often felt like I was the only one driving. It's a mystery to me how so many racers can exist on such a small track and remain largely entirely separate from each other, but it definitely makes the game feel rather isolating when the only reminder that you're racing against someone is the fraction in the upper corner of the screen.Again this is linked to another issue in the game, that being how unbalanced the different cars are and the laughably inept AI racers the game pits you against. Drift is by far the most important stat in the game, so much so that it means cars with a high drift rating will almost always be far and away the best vehicles in the game, rendering all but two or three cars impractical to try and drive. After only a few races I'd settled upon the Panther and found myself dominating every race despite driving like an absolute madman and crashing into things on a near constant basis. If the game starts out easy it trickles down to a virtual void of challenge, as I blew through race after race wondering if I had somehow been caught in a loop and wasn't actually moving forward in events.Keeping with the trend of every issue being intrinsically linked to another, that feeling of consistent repetition is the result of an abundance of redundancies in track designs and event types. There are only twelve tracks in the game, and at least half of them feel almost interchangeable with one another, with the others being iconic mostly for their backgrounds and not any interesting track layout. The handful of different event types again double up on each other, with checkpoint and single lap time trials feeling nearly identical and the only alteration between elimination and evade being the obnoxious mines placed along the track. There's already a noticeable lack of content in Super Toy Cars, but having so much of it feel so similar to each other and stretch on so long somehow seems worse than if the game had just been half as long.The monotonous grind of repeated events robs the game of any sense of progression. You aren't looking forward to new tracks because there aren't any; you aren't looking to improve your skills because the AI is never challenging you. There's no desire to buy new cars as so many are useless, and upgrades are needless and so inexpensive you can be fully upgraded after only a half dozen races or less.And then there are the usual hallmarks of unfinished games: glitchy audio, constant collision issues, hitting invisible walls and clipping through solid ones, random frame rate drops, and a rather embarrassingly bare bones online mode (which doesn't even support private lobbies or inviting friends).I like what Super Toy Cars is going for, and I think with a few more months of development it could have become a lot more than it did, but being ostensibly finished it feels pointless to hold out hope that its problems will ever be fixed, or that it's even in a state that could be remedied with a few patches. I'm not sure if it was pushed out the door early or its developers really thought it was finished, but the end result is still a game that's in need of attention it won't receive.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												A racing game with a variety of different competition styles, all set on a miniature scale as the toys of children race around and around. This is the exact premise of Super Toy Cars, as one could easily imagine from the name. Going into the game, I was expecting something either trying to rekindle the days of the Hot Wheels PC games or something to compete with racing games based around cartoon style mayhem such as the Mario Kart series, or even the long forgotten Diddy Kong Racing. What I found was neither here nor there, but something in between.Getting into my first race was simple enough. I opted to do the Career mode to experience the game as well as gain the required points and coins to unlock new races and cars. The race itself lacks the feeling of high speed you would expect from a racing game, but with all the vehicles evenly matched, at the very least there was still that thrill of fighting for first place. Racing around through a course lined with children's toys, shortcuts, and sudden jumps here and there made up for the lack of high speed intensity; then came the power ups, which vary from game changing heat seeking rockets to mostly useless giant 8-balls that the other drivers always manage to avoid with ease due to the slow speed.The tracks themselves are interesting enough, but other than the default races and the elimination modes, there isn't much that grabs your attention to make the game fun. Luckily, the races and elimination modes occur often enough in Career mode to maintain that level of interest.There is the ability to upgrade your vehicles but the upgrades make little to no difference in the overall feel of the vehicles. At most you will get to the front of the pack a little more quickly, but when other vehicles can boost and use power ups the same as you it usually won't matter. Considering the way the AI is established as well, getting to the front of the pack without the upgrades is usually doable anyway, so it's purely a coin sink.Vehicle variety is very nice, however, relating back to looks overtaking the statistical aspects. Of all 16 vehicles, each with several paint schemes, each has a unique flair about it that appeals to someone.Outside of Career, Quick Race, and Multiplayer, there is the Track Editor. Simplistic but fun, it's easy for anyone to jump in and design their dream track within the limits set, of course. Players can adjust the size and shape of the track, fill it with props of their choosing, and, by being able to do those things, they can make a race as exciting and challenging, or as boring and mundane, as possible.Super Toy Cars is not a game aimed towards adults, and yet it was still a rather enjoyable experience even for me. Though it lacked the challenge of big name racers, or the finesse and quirky attitude of games such as Mario Kart, Super Toy Cars still manages to shine where it matters most: fun factor.

								Micro Machines or RE-VOLT was your first impression too when you look this game? Two great classics.I like this game already, is a inspired game and Super Toy Cars is doing great so far. For a Early Access the game is running pretty well and smooth.To be honest, Early Access games on Steam is going to a way where we can't trust on everyone, but for five bucks and already see all theses great features implemented, the devs deserve a try.

												And the long anticipated day has finally come, Super Toy Cars is fully released! Originally released through Early Access in March, Super Toy Cars has gone through months of updates and polish and is the better for it. It's definitely one of my favorite racing games on Steam, if not one of my favorite games on Steam, period.The mechanics of this game are more influenced by physics than most other kart racing games I've played, and though it takes a little bit of getting used to, is very enjoyable once you get the hang of it. I'd highly recommend checking out the guides I've written to understand things like the drift system when you get started. It took me maybe two hours before I got proficient at it, though with the refinements to the system since I picked it up back when it was first available you'll probably get the hang of it much quicker.Track design is pretty good, though the art for such is not as inspired or unique as something like Mario Kart (which of course has a long history of games to draw on). It's certainly by no means bad though and will keep you going as you progress through the game. Car design (and here's the relevant guide on that), on the other hand, is much more interesting, drawing on a number of real life cars, and providing lots of cosmetic options to keep you from getting bored. The cars also handle very differently and provide their own unique challenges, though they do fall into a few general categories. The difference between the light and heavy cars is far more pronounced than it is in other kart racing games, and some cars can really keep you on your toes!The career mode is probably where you're going to be spending the bulk of your time. There are a large number of challenges to complete and it will probably keep you occupied for 5-10 hours. One of my guides goes in depth on each game mode so I'll spare you the details. Completing each one will take some work, especially in later levels, but is definitely do-able.This game has both local and online multiplayer, with support for up to 4 and 8 players, respectively. Unfortunately I don't have anyone to test the local multiplayer with so I can't say if the game handles splitscreen well (for example, in the recent Mario Kart 8 people have noticed reduced frame rate with four players). Local multiplayer is also where you can choose any track or mode to play singleplayer. Online works well though, with no bugs in the netcode to speak of. Hard to say how many people you'll find online at this point, though I don't expect the player population to be able to match that of AAA racing games on Steam like Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed. I have played online a few times and found it quite fun. There's AI to fill in for missing players, and it's generally pretty competent (both here and in singleplayer).Now for some miscellaneous details. Steam Workshop support is a thing in this game, and there's a track editor that uses it. Performance is pretty good as well. My computer (a four year old mid-to-low tier laptop) can run the game at a stable 45 FPS at low settings, and the game looks pretty nice turned all the way up if you've got an actually good computer to handle it. The achievement list is fun, with a good balance of challenge, and it's one of the few games I've bothered to 100% the achievements in. The devs are great people and are very open to feedback, making this one of the best-handled (formerly) Early Access games on Steam I've seen. The price is fair, and if you enjoy kart racing games you can't really go wrong with this one. In short, this game is great!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Think of Super Toy Cars as a cross between Re-Volt and Penny Racers/Choro-Q. It's a fun little game for cheap despite being in it's early stages. Despite being in early access currently I'd consider it a full-featured game content wise. Nice variety of tracks, several cars with unique handling, a really fun local split screen mode and decent online. There is a track editor as well that's pretty intuitive. Only major complaint I have is the cars feel a little ""floaty"", hence the Penny Racers comparison (besides the general look of the game)...other than that I think it's a fantastic game.

Early Access Review
								Just picked this up for five bucks and I would say it is worth it.The game is charming and has almost the same feel as mario cart/sackboy racing. You are controlling a toy car and in environments that  are pretty cool, like being in the kitchen and racing around food and stuff or racing around a kids room and so on.  Music sounds pretty good and sound effects are also pretty good.You can buy other cars with the ingame currency you earn by racing and you can upgrade your little cars as well.Also there is a track editor too so there will totally be workshop tracks popping up from the community.For an early access game it runs/plays great and the keyboard works well though I always switch to my ps3 controller and emulate xbox controls through a ds3 tool (motioninjoy). The graphics look good and I can't wait for more people to pick this up so I can play online multiplayer. I only noticed the game through the featured list and not the EA list, there is no forum up yet either.			",331,64,7,51,27,2,21

												This was pretty obviously made by people who loved the hell out of Re-Volt on the Dreamcast. As well they should, because Re-Volt owned. This one tries but is a little too buggy and unpolished to make the mark. There's a good variety of cars but the tracks are pretty samey, with no good gimmicks or unique features and some frustrating invisible walls. The drifting mechanic is also pretty weird and stiff if you're used to Mario Kart, but I got the hang of it eventually. Races aren't too hard if you keep buying and upgrading new cars, though it should be mentioned that there's zero rubberbanding, which is both a blessing and a curse. If one CPU driver pulls away from the pack he can be impossible to catch, forcing a restart if you want gold. Most races are basic time trials or eliminations, but there is one neat one called Evade where the track is covered in mines, and the last place car is eliminated every 15 seconds. Those races are more about driving carefully than fast, and they can be pretty intense. It's not a bad game, just an unpolished one. I got all the way through it but I wouldn't recommend it unless you are dying for an arcade racer right now.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												Fun little racer (pun intended). It's as the title indicates: you are a toy car racer. The tracks are set up in some kids bedroom, lol. Anyway, although this game isnt super intricate, the car upgrade system works well and the car choices present you with options based on your driving preferences. They all look like the Mattel or Tonka or wahtever...toy cars we grew up on, so points added there.The music is catchy, the tracks look cool, and the cars handle well enough. There is no realism involved necessarily, but then they are toy cars, so why would there be? btw, there are power ups throughout the course which give you weapons or boosts. Those add another fun element to the races.This is just simply a cute and fun little racer. I played a bit offline, so my total time is a little skewed, but yeah, easy to recommend this one.One sad note though...while there are some cool tracks in the workshop for this game (and btw...creating your own tracks is super simple as is sharing them on the Workshop), the online itself is largely dead, so if you really want to play against other people, try to make sure you have friends with the game (and/or be a good friend and buy them copies).All in all, good simple fun. I give this one 7.5/10			",2038,1022,52,316,205,18,280

Early Access Review
								Thanks to Motoki's awesome generosity (thanks again Motoki =D)  I've given Super Toy Cars a good ol' playing. I like it a lot, it is a little buggy here and there, nothing devastating, but it's still Early Access so that's to be expected. It's another ""Top Downy Toy Car Racery Arcadey Game"" * in the mould of Little Racers STREET, Bang Bang Racing, Mini Motor Racing EVO etc. I'm gonna post some pros and cons for this one.PROS- Very nice graphics, one of the prettier of the genre so far, on par with Bang Bang Racing.- Different cars have fairly different driving characteristics, which you can see from their specs on the Purchase screens. Acceleration, Top Speed, Handling etc ratings are shown here and DO make quite a difference. Some cars are quite ""drifty"" on corners, others have better handling and grip but you can apply the handbrake to drift on the sharper turns.- Weapons - Like Mario Kart, Wipeout etc you can pick up ""single use"" weapons off the track to use against other drivers. - Choice of three views - close behind, further behind and a Micro Machines style zoomed out and directly overhead view (I had the most success with the far behind view. I would prefer an option of far behind and higher up like the one's available in Little Racers and Bang Bang)- Fun tracks, all kinda toy themed, like the old Micro Machines game- Great soundtrack by ""The Spin Wires""- Track editor and Steam Workshop support (although it seems fairly complex compared to Mini Motor Racing EVO's)CONS- A little buggy, in the hit detection you can clip objects that don't seem to be there. On one of the maps, a small raise up in the track can flip and flick your car up and get you sideways. In the ""Minefield"" track a mine can suddenly appear directly in front of you giving you no chance to evade it. Again, nothing too serious though. For an early access game the game is very highly polished compared to some.- The tubes you have to drive through on some maps, are a ♥♥♥♥♥. Extremely difficult to negotiate without clipping them or getting flipped onto your side on the exit. Some cars seem a little better at getting through them cleanly.In the Battle of the ""Top Downy Toy Car Racery Arcadey Games"" * , I'd place them in this order:1) Little Racers STREET2) Bang Bang Racing3) Super Toy Cars4) Mini Motor Racing EVO* The term ""Top Downy Toy Car Racery Arcadey Game"" © MinDRioT 2014			",1870,707,91,183,192,22,269

Early Access Review
								Even though it's an Early Access game, I can tell this game has some SERIOUS potential. It's cute, it's Mario Kart-like, and it plays like a classic fun racer. There are a few bugs in the game (I'll outline the good and the bad below) but for $5 or so, it's one of those Early Access games you can play with and feel really good about what's to come.Before I contrast the good and the bad, I should mention that if you're wanting a realistic racer, this isn't for you. Hence the title, ""Super Toy Cars"". Expect there to be some over-the-top physics and gameplay. It feels much more like a console game that is reminiscent of the old Micro Machines games and Diddy Kong Racing on the N64. As of now, it's a blast to play. I've been sitting here for a couple of hours just getting to know the game, and it's got some fun dimensions to it that would make it even more of a blast when you're playing with a bunch of friends online.That being said, here's what I've found good and bad (mind you, this is based off the Early Access):The Good:- A wide selection of cars to choose from- The upgrades to your vehicles are noticeable, and add a whole new element to your favorite car- You WILL have a favorite car- Drifting is encouraged and fun to do to gain ""Boost"" (I thought it would be a downside, but it's definitely not!)- The controls are simple, making for a game pretty much anyone can play and enjoy- Nice, consistent graphics that any decent machine can run- Looks decent at 1080p- Full XBox 360 controller support (for those of you who use controllers)- Wide variety of tracks that you can set the difficulty for- A set of different race types that are fun to play- A track editor! An awesome track editor!- Different camera views to suit your prefence of gameplay (even a top-down, view!)- Beautiful potential for multiplayer- Nice array of power-ups (and a neat little subset screen to watch your opponents run into them)- Each car is unique in how it handles, and there is most likely going to be a car editor in the future- No rubberband AI! You can lap around opponents and not feel like how well you've done on a level can be taken from you in a second because of stupid freaking rubberbanding!- Very well-scaled AIThe Bad:- Definitely not finished- Invisible walls to some of the maps make it difficult to judge how to turn- Sometimes landing a high jump will cause your car to embed into the track- The physics need to be tweaked just a little bit- When you ""die"", you have a moment or two of invulnerability - just beware that other cars do, as well. Once you or them ""pop back into existence"", be sure that your car is clear of the other ones, or you might ping off into space- The tracks and races in career mode don't have names, making it seem very vanilla- Tracks also don't have very much special about them in career mode- No way to set the difficulty in career mode- BIG ONE: Very limited options for display settings (anti-aliasing and the like)- No way to take off upgrades you've purchased for your vehicles- Though there are a lot of types of pick-ups, it would feel better if there were even more (invulnerability, for example)- In career mode, the tracks start to become repetitive- Sometimes just driving outside of the lines of a track will reset your car- It has the feel of a game ported from a console- HUGE CONCERN: There is an inability to be able to customize the controlsRecommendations:- If you haven't had the thought to already, making custom tracks available for multiplayer would be amazing- The ability to run our own music through the game (for example, being able to choose a music folder on your computer and play that instead of the in-game music - which is very good, by the way... some others may disagree, though)- MORE ACHIEVEMENTS!!- Better control of the graphics- Assignable controls (PLEASE!)- ^^^ASSIGNABLE CONTROLS!!!!^^^- Once again, assignable controls- More color options for vehicles- Steam Workshop support (might be reaching a bit, but there is just so much potential here)- Assignable. Freaking. Controls.- The game could maybe use a little bit of humor along with the gameplay... I mean, it is satisfying and hilarious to crush your opponents with a giant 8-ball, but maybe some ""Ohh YEAH!"" sound effects. Or maybe if it was a random object that you chucked forward? Something like a baseball, a cheeseburger, small dog, Gilbert Gottfried, etc...All in all, this game is amazing. It really is. At the small price it's at for an Early Access game, you're going to get your money's worth and see a TON of improvement. I'm sure by the time this thing is polished 100%, it's going to be a top-seller here.			",98,32,4,9,11,1,12

												Now, lets set somthing straight before we get startedI was raised on Re-Volt, Crash Team Racing and Mario KartDo you now what all 3 of those games have in common? They are all interesting with a fair bit of replayability Re-Volt made you feel like you were handling actual toy cars, in addition to having an impressive selection of cars/tracksCrash Team Racing was just the best. Small-ish selection for cars and tracks. But the power-ups and the sheer uniqueness of the entire game made this a gemMario Kart was the great grandfather of kart racing, and had a fairly large track selection and had plenty of multiplayer mayhemDoes Super Toy Cars do this? Yes. For about an hour and a half. Then it gets *really* dull *REALLY* quicklyThe number of tracks described in the description is slightly wrong, or at least pretty misleading. They mean there are 12 tracks TOTAL, and there are 4 different locations TOTAL. It doesnt mean ""there are 12 tracks in 4 locations for a total of 48 tracks"" Moreover, the tracks are very simple affairs, nothing really unique about them at allThe cars are meh. Between the hitboxes being helariously random (as they collide with the track funkily, making drifting a chore when you clip a tube wall wrong, or get bumped out of a drift by a guy 3 feet away). This also makes ramming quite literally a hit or miss situationAlso, each car has stats that determine how they run. The only way to see these stats is to go into the campaign mode and memorize them, as you cannot see the during ""quick race"" or ""multiplayer"" modes. But again, unless if its an extreme stat (insanely high or low) you will not notice a difference. Without fail the high speed models (formula 1 car generally) will have a piece of cake for the races, where as the more maneuverable or more weighty models get lapped constantly with very little balancingThe powerups are lame. There is not much really to be said about them other than they feel weak because of the funky physics on the car's part. If a car gets hit with an 8ball (a very powerful weapon) it kind of gets spun a little... It also has the annoying feature of replacing your powerup whenever you drive over a new one. Making sure that you cant save them for when you need themSo in summary, I would give Super Toy Cars a 4/10Its not a bad game, just a game done poorly. Pick it up if its on sale for 4 dollars or less, but dont expect muchTL:DR VERSIONOk racing game gets boring quickly. Spend 10 dollars elsewhere			",381,26,11,35,36,3,43

								First impressions: http://www.cublikefoot.com/super-toy-cars-first-impressions/A relaxing kart racer with toy cars, who wouldn’t want that?The game is already running smoothly, even in its early access state, and I’ve yet to encounter any game-breaking bugs. The gameplay is as expected from a kart racer, or, in this case, toy car racer. Be the first to cross the finish line after that last lap and make use of items and obstacles along the way to either benefit you or put your enemies at a disadvantage. I found the game to be surprisingly easy. I’ve yet to lose a race, or maybe I’m just too good for the game?Super Toy Cars has some pretty neat graphics, on top of a nice soundtrack. There are a variety of cars and tracks to choose from, a nice addition (and still more to come, as the game is in early access). The game even has a track editor, which is awesome!There are a few minor bugs that I’ve run into, however. One being that collisions with other vehicles and objects are wonky and don’t seem to work as expected. This is really noticeable with the tubes that can be driven through. You’re easily clipped into them, which is quite annoying.Other than that, Super Toy Cars is a pretty solid game and earns my recommendation.			",1406,554,55,149,193,17,226

								Super Toy Cars IS a good game.It's seems bland, repetitative and the music never really changes beat.. If hear ""start to ignite"", one more time..Having said that, IT IS still in development so the game is not polished; but it has heaps of potential. It has all the hallmark racing themes, plain races, elimation and time trial and likley more that I didnt see.I wouldn't buy it again in its current state - but hey there is nothing wrong with it really; it would not be a waste of your $ if you bought it.Enjoy!

												I'm a sucker for the arcade racing genre, so I purchased this game early on (it might have been early access, I don't remember now), and I pretty much immediately wrote it off.  More than anything the chunky hit boxes and punishing reset mechanics made for an infurating experience.  That said, I'm glad I re-downloaded and gave it another shot.  It's still not perfect but it's a whole lot better.  In some ways the racing experience is among the most satisfactory of the arcade racers I play (among them, Bang Bang Racing, Mini-motors EVO, Little Street Racers) because it feels like the AI cars neither cheat nor are handicapped in an unrealistic manner.  What remains imperfect are the hitboxes on some areas of some maps, which occasionally will find you stuck on parts that should clearly be traversable. Also, the heavily-mined elimination maps in career mode are almost hair-on-the-tongue annoying, at least if you're the sort that tries to get first on every map.  I would rate myself as mediocre at this genre, for what it's worth, so if you're an ace at driving games, this might be too simple for you.			",110,35,6,14,18,2,38

												A fun game at first but posess really little challenge, I completed the game to 100% and now I don't know why I should really play it, maybe only if my friends had the game and we could play it together, but that's it.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the game for all it was worth, I was happy to see that there is a track creator, but last time I played it the track creator was very buggy and confusing to use, with limited props and a glitchy pathway system.The game plays like any other kid friendly racing game, Mario Kart, Crash Team Racing etc. You choose your car, you have the start boost, you get boost for drifting and you get power ups, nothing too special but it also lets you drive on a kitchen counter, there's charm to the game but it really doesn't differ too much from it's more successful counterparts.During campaign you can buy and unlock new cars and skins for the cars to make your car more yours, you can give it upgrades until you upgrade all your cars and get the achievement, but that really is it, the upgrades are only for the campaign mode, not for multiplayer, which has it's positives and negatives, positives in the fact that everyone has an equal chance, negatives the fact that you spend your ingame money on upgrades that you will probably have a use in like once or twice, and then the campaign ends.Oh yeah, the game also gives you a replay addition, cool huh? Shame that the replay A.I. sometimes forgets where you actually went and you end up crashing into walls during your replay, even if you have not crashed once during the actual race, greaaat.Multiplayer: So the game is not popular, and you could probably see it if you played it, there isn't many people playing it, shame actually because the game is best when played with other people.I'd say buy the game only if you have friends to play it with, it's not really a game to play on your own unless you just want to fill up your achievement pool with some more easily accuired achievements.I recommend the game because it has charm and it's fun to play, but I suggest buying it if it is on a sale, don't waste £6.99 on this game, or like I wasted £10 when it first came out, it has it's charm but as a one off achievement grab game, it's not worth the price.I rate this game at 5 out of 10 mini ferrarri's			",88,10,3,7,5,0,1

								This looks like it's going to be a GREAT addition to ""fun racing"" games.  Ala Mario Kart, this game delivers in all the right places.  It's not as diverse as our good friend Mario Mario, but it also hasn't had the money/time thrown at it (yet).I haven't really dug deep into the playing of the game, just yet.  Mainly due to the Early Access.  What I have played (100% score on first ""Career Mode"" level) has shown me all I need to scribble this down:This game is awesome!  The speed/handling of the cars need work, sure, but even as is it's still a LOT of fun to test.  (Heck, it's so fun I could call it playing over testing.)  <--Few Early A. games get that honor.  Keep in mind it is a ""Fun Racing"" game though.  If you're after realism, a game with ""Toy"" in the title should be all the review you need ;)Here is where I would moan about ""not enough cars"", but I can't.  It doesn't have tons upon tons of cars, or customization (But I am sure that is chalked up to Early A.)  You start off with one car, a Jeep looking thing (Without the tail...)  If you ace the first ""Career Mode"" levels, you will have enough to buy any of the ""unlocked"" cars (and max out it's upgrades).  That's right, there are quite a few cars and upgrades already; I just stress the room for moar!Now, being forever alone, I have not tried multi-player.  So, I will skip that part and move right into the Track Editor.  This wonderful addition is my favorite part.  I hope they give it some love, since it's a little restrictive with the camera (and placement of pieces)  Otherwise, it's a very nice way to design your own (and in my case better!!!!) tracks.  With 4 settings, crammed with tons of props/hazards; let's just say you'll want to get your kart on.Gonna have to say 9/10 (A few, to be expected, bugs hold back the elusive 1)			",36,13,1,10,7,0,6

								For what it is it is fantastic fun , its like an old school type racer where the main objective is about fun and there is lots of that . Super Toy Cars starts off fairly easy but as you progress the racing becomes far more aggressive and strategic , If you have a soft spot for old games like Re Volt I urge you to try this out , I think this is better TBH , sometimes Gaming can capture imagination and Super Toy Cars has done just that, it has a certain charm about it !  at the price steam are asking for it I think it is too good to pass up.

												Not recommend for most everyone.Recommend to those who are already big fans of racing games. [I really don't like steam's simplistic yes/no review system; this isn't a bad game, but there are many better games in the same price range]PROS:-Variety of carsCONS:-Wacky physics-""upgrades"" on the cars are pointless as they just improve the car. It isn't some type of loadout where gear is a tradeoff....you just buy each piece once and once your car is upgraded thats it. -Invisible walls-Pointless weapons and poor weapon system (if you run over a box while already having one, it replaces your current item...this means the person in front will get all the boxes but at the same time if you want to save a specific item you have to dodge the other item boxes...)-Lack of HUD/UI elements (you seem to only be able to drift above a certain speed but that speed is...??)-Online playerbase is dead (no online games)			",383,122,8,34,26,3,50

												Originally voted for this on Steam Greenlight, but i'm dissapointed. I was aware of the bad reviews before I got the game, but ended up getting it in a bundle so tried it out anyway.Like some reviewers have said, it's obviously inspired by Micro Machines & Re-volt, but unfortunately the result is a game which has too many issues to be fun or even worth playing. I only actually played (and completed, the campaign is 1.5 hours long) the game for the trading cards.Overall, it feels unfinished, and it's not really worth the time to play, unfortunately.Positives+ The models of the cars are decent quality.+ The music is okay (at least the first few times it plays).+ The micro machines-like concept of small cars in a big world is a good concept.Negatives- Physics are clunky and floaty, in a bad way rather than a comedic way. This breaks the game for a few reasons:The game's ""stuck prevention"" mechanic will occour seemingly at random. I had occasions where I was in 1st and the game would randomly respawn me in 8th place for no reason. Other times you'll hit one of the many invisible walls and completely slow down, then be respawned way behind the other competetors. Or hit a wall which is only partially sold, get stuck and then be respawned in 8th.The game has physics objects which act as obstacles. The only problem is that all of them share the same similar floaty physics, meaning that they will often stop you completely if you even slightly collide with them. It's also extremely difficult to avoid these objects as they happen so frequently throughout the races.Essentially, the main issue is that the game is constantly slowing you down or teleporting you without reason. - The game doesn't handle speed well, which is a common problem in racing games. At times it doesn't feel like you're really moving, but at other times you'll suddenly be going so fast that it will be impossible to control. Also it's another racing game which relies heavily on drifting to get boosts.-It feels like there's a lot of missing sound effects. You'll constantly hear the same engine sound, and other sound effects like objects bumping into each other are missing, which sounds strange.-Although the car models are good, the environment objects are really mixed in terms of quality. Most of the objects in the environment look either low quality, or very stretched for some reason.  Also, the roads are way too reflective or shiny and it looks odd.Minor issues:Boosting seems like it will occasionally not improve your speed at all.Drifting will sometimes get stuck and you'll still be drifting even when you're not holding down the button anymore (could be an issue with using the PS3 controller) ",149,65,9,23,16,1,20

								Simple enough racing game. Choose from a variety of cars in the career mode, upgrade them with the game money earnt from winning races.In the career mode there are a variety of different stages with levels, most of them include the following:Race: race to the finish line.Time Trial: Win with the correct time (you're the only one on the track so there is no pressure).Checkpoint: Get to the checkpoint before time runs out, you get more points added each checkpoint you pass.Evade: Race while evading lot's of really anoying mines all over the road, sometimes this will have another annoying rule to it, every 15 seconds the last player get's banished and loses.Bad things about the game is the drifting can be annoying at times, but it shouldnt get in your way too much, and how every race you have to start last (i think that that is in all racing games though) makes it very hard to get in front when the game AI get better cars.Apart from them the game is a great game, with a great price.

												Super Toy Cars=Super Fun!!!Its simple, yet challenging. I played it one weekend, and finally, just dominated every race. I was kinda disappointed, as I enjoy a good challenge. I then got busy for the next 3 days. When on the fourth day, I tried it, I was surprised at how rusty I was that I even failed at a race challenge that I usually had no problem with!One down side is, that the online mutli-player lobby is usually empty. I first tried an online race, June 14, 2014. I was the only one on. I tried a second race. Again, only me. So I checked the time. 9:27pm Eastern time. This game will be complete once the online lobby fills up completely with racers.This is also the perfect game to try to get used to racing games, bumper car type games, games where you get items to use against the other racers(such as MarioKarts.)Ill be keeping my eye on the multi player lobby. Hopefully, it'll start filling up and I can fix the part of this review and say multi player is going smoothly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								There's a reason these reviews mention Re-Volt and Micro Machines, and that is, if you've played them, you know exactly what you're in for. If you haven't, let's put it this way: the game revloves around racing RC cars through tracks made from stuff in different locations (Specifically a baby's toyroom, a street, and a garage) with picups like Mario Kart and Re-Volt (things like missiles, oil slicks, boost, and glue). The cars handle strangely but entertainingly and the tracks are great fun as well with lots of flying jumps and obstacles.It's great fun, though still somewhat buggy, and apparently still under development. My main complaint is the sometimes uneven difficulty with Time Trials being the easiest and the mode that spawn mines randomply over the cours being the hardest, though that may just be my skill level speaking.

												This game had lots of design work. It feels great to pull around those corners while pulling down the hand break. The cars are fast and hard to control (compared to mario kart). The items enrich the game act as a boost for newbies. How many racing games let you say that you race in a jeep? In theory. I realise that that isn't technically complete, but mmmyyyey.The problem is in graphics. Now I know that lots of you are going to get up a proclaim ""I don't need shiny graphis!"". You are probably mostly right. When people say this they are generally refering to detail and quality. The problem is in lighting. The lighting is fine in brighter levels. It's still kind of ugly and we've had better lighting on things for a long time (the early mario karts), but it's some thing I'll live with. On darker levels I end up with areas of my screen entirely black and the head lights don't help. It's immersion breaking and just rips you right out.I recommend this game, but only if it's on sale. Post Script: I haven't played this in a while, they might've fixed it by now. If you're reading this I will give an update shortly.			",51,2,1,3,8,1,4

The menu music had me struggling to start the game because it was just so nice to listen to!The gameplay is simple and to the point.  Race and win by any means necessary!  That's what arcade racing is supposed to be.  Fact-paced, high-impact adrenaline fuelled fun.Big shoutout to the devs and support team for this game.  I think we'll be seeing a lot of Eclipse Gaming for a long time to come.As a sidenote: I run my games on a 21:9 display, which some games have a hard time with.

												An extremely tepid, generic, forgettable experience. It's a decent time-waster, for sure, and I genuinely have to admire the sense of scale and speed, as well as the colorful track design. However, the concerningly massive number of typos are a first sign that the experience is a bit slapdash, and the downright uncomfortable drifting mechanic makes Ridge Racer Unbounded seem comparatively intuitive (this game has two ways to use the handbrake and neither really works well).AI competitors are inept to a childish degree, and I don't mean how a child plays a video game like this. I mean when they're bored inside a real car and run the car up a wall and then keep bumping it against the seat. I watched in amused awe as no less than three of the AI at once all decided not to take the turn ahead and instead wedge themselves into a corner, respawn before the corner, and do it again. And again. And again.Visually, it's a mess. I mean, it's very neatly modeled and colorful and well designed, but this is all marred by a very questionable blurring effect that applies depth of field or... something, extremely wonkily. It just looks like vaseline smeared on random parts of the camera.Audio-wise, the actual vehicle audio is decently okay. The pop-style soundtrack is genuinely impressive, except for the very repetitive main menu tune. Like, seriously, I see why the soundtrack provider is shown prominently in advertising for the game and on the first loading screen. It's pretty damn good. Though with lyrics about having women in one arm and booze in the other, it makes me figure this isn't supposed to be a kid's game, which makes me wonder who it actually IS for. Bored twenty-somethings and up looking for a bit of nostalgia of the good old days banging toy cars against each other like myself, I suppose. In any case, I totally want to find more of the musician's work, because it's really great, really serene. The high point of the game by a long shot.I have extremely fond memories of Mad Tracks, and absolutely love racing games in general. Toy car racing games are a rather rare niche, especially outside of top-down games in the vein of Micro Machines, but even then, this fails to stand out. I obtained it in a bundle with many other cheap indie racing titles. I switched vehicles and noticed that the one I picked, the WRC4, bizarrely steered itself around the track for some reason. After that and a rehashed mission type with mines added where it turns out all the AI immediately steered into mines and blew themselves up, only for me to hit one and launch ahead faster and win, I gave up. Not terrible, but there are so many great racing games crying out for your attention, time, and wallet that this just isn't worth it. As it is, I'll likely just leave it running for cards and not bother booting it again.			",202,57,48,14,17,5,10

								It's a fun arcade racer.The graphics are nice and fit the game well. The sound and music are competently done. The selection of cars is pretty good and also varied so that they do not all drive the same. The single player racing is not that hard once you master drifiting, but it's also not simple. The single player portion is not long, but it's fun and well worth the price.			",93,18,4,12,17,1,28

								This is a casual racing game which seems to be inspired by Mario Kart. Power ups, upgradable vehicles, a good selection of vehicles that range from Jeeps and Vans to Ferraris, Lamborghinis, and more. The game has an air of fun and simplicity surrounding it. It is not in any way serious, and a good game / time killer for the price of $6.99. If you're looking for something that is easy to get into and doesn't have a steep learning curve, and is not a racing sim like Need For Speed, GRID, and so on, I'd suggest this game.

												This is one of them trashy games you pick for a few pennies or from a cheap bundle. Game play is okay I guess but it’s fairly buggy with random crashes and invisible walls. Decent amount of cars with extra boosts and power ups but it gets old after a short while. Again okay amount of tracks but they have the same or similar design. The tried with this game but failed and it’s differently not worth it’s 6.99 price. If you can get it cheap enough, then try it but you may find the game to get old very quickly or as I found a little too easy on some racers after you’ve got all the fast cars with their upgrades.

Some textures are only loading when you're in the range of 10m.-GameplayThe gameplay was weird. Quick races are only for local multiplayer, so i've only played one race of the carrer.Didnt even try the multiplayer. I cant expect many people to play it. And even less i believe that it works flawless.-SoundsThats the main point why i quit the game so fast, besides to it being weird and bad.The Sound Effects had such a low bad quality, only the music quality was good, i didnt like the music though.There is no sound for crashing into a wall, which is definetly way more important than many other sounds it actually features. Well, all sound bad.-ControlsThe game uses the arrow keys when started first. I changed it to WASD, Handbrake was on CTRL btw...-QualityThe overall quality was just really bad.I know some people will probably say i cant judge about a game after 10 minutes of playtime, but i think i can.Its clearly much worse than other ""Toy Car"" games.Also, the game says ""Are you blind man?"" and something else when driving backwards and then just resets your Vehicle...-Overall ExperienceBad. Seriously, i would not recommend you to get that game. Search for other games instead.			",132,45,12,14,32,1,7

												Its a good game. That being said I honestly thought the game was going to be a lot better then it is currently. The Career mode should be diveded into classes instead of the any car can race in any race. Because at the later levels your gonna get pounded on if you use a slower car. I wish they would have done it like Little Racers Street and make them into classes. Like the A thru E class. I think it would make a lot more sense. The handeling for cars is just strange. The truck is terrible at handeling it cannot take a tight turn for whatever reason. The drifting does not feel right. Its slows you down a lot.. Its just strange. It doesnt feel right. The tracks are fine but like someone else said a little boring.  The powerups as some one said before are not very good. I would agree if your ahead then your more then likely going to stay ahead because all of the weapons require a car behind you. For example a missle or the 8 ball both need line of sight. Their are a few traps  that stay on the track but are easily avoided.I would have liked to see a system of drops that gave out turbo perhaps to the other cars behind to keep it interesting and every race would be close. Also it takes a long time to respawn weapon drops so if your behind some other car good luck on getting a power up. As it is the game is just ok. It could have been so much better. Graphics are good but everything feels chunky. Although that might be what the graphics guy wanted.So their you have it. A good game but not great.			",299,147,32,35,36,9,44

												I really wish I could reccomend this game because I had rather high hopes for it, but I just feel like I wasted my money. I suppose you can't expect much from an indie game, but there are a lot of things that need work. The graphics aren't terribly interesting, and most tracks just look the same. The tracks themselves aso feel very self-contained, and not like they're part of a bigger world (which is what I'd expect from a game about tiny cars in a big house). The soundtrack is a few rather forgettable songs from some indie band you've invariably never heard of, and it will liekly leave you muting it and playing your own choice of music instead. And last but not least, the whole thing seems like it took big ideas from other racers (small scale, wepons, upgrades, etc), but didn't grasp what made them good. If you're looking for a new Micro Machines or Revolt, try something else. This just doesn't live up to its peers.			",138,18,4,10,20,1,8

YouTube™ Video: Swash! ❧ Super Toy Cars Critique (Review) 

			Views: 320		

			An in-depth critique by SwashbucklingSir of the action-racer Super Toy Cars, which is highly influences by the micro machines series. Does it live up to the stellar racers from the 90s?		

Super Toy Cars tries to bring their influences of the micro machines series to the today's era. Sadly, the effort is mostly in vain.The graphics are ugly, especially the edges are very rough, even with 8x MSAA activated. The screenshots shown above are highly post-processed and do not represent the ingame graphics. The sound design is plainly bad. While the music is good, the few tracks get repetitive very quickly and the sound effects are incredibly hideous. The gameplay overall is also subpar. The cars, while feeling distinct from another, all are floaty, act unpredictably in terms of physics, the sliding mechanics requires you to hold a button, which feels unnatural and there are also very few tracks in the base game. However there is a track editor, thus this problem might be solved by the community.Overall, I would not recommend Super Toy Cars. If you are desperate for an action-racing game and are looking for a couple of hours of enjoyment, maybe with friends, Super Toy Cars could be it, since there is not much other stuff out there. But it's no Mario Kart, Blur or Micro Machines.			",392,95,7,34,37,3,51

												One of the many games that could use a neutral sign, instead of just thumbs up or down.The value of this game depends on your needs as a gamer, and on your age too.I've got it from a bundle and I'm happy I didn't pay the full price, but at the same time I'm happy to own it, because sometimes I just want to play a casual, easy game just to relax for a bit, and this is especially good at it.In fact, this game is even too easy if you're an experienced gamer as me, and probably even as an average one, but you know, sometimes you don't have the mood to get into simulators or hard games, and just want those 30/60 minutes of relax with an easy and fun game.Thanks to the good graphics and catchy soundtrack, playing this game is fun and puts you in a good mood.You've got a good selection of cars which you need to purchase with the money you collect by playing, and a positive thing is that they really feels different and there's usually one to match your preferred play style, or even to match the needs of certain tracks. You can also upgrade some aspects of them, but at a certain point you'll have to buy a better one anyway.The game spreads into many levels of increasing difficulty, each of which has 6 tracks to play. The game mode can be any of the few that the developer created, like normal races, elimination, time attack and so on.The variety of the tracks is decent enough to me: they can have one of the few backgrounds available (like kitchen, garage and what else), and each has an assortment of different tracks available, and I guess you play at least once for each game mode on each track of the campaign.To beat your enemies you have to play well or you won't have many chances, unless you use a car that's so much more powerful, but that obviously cannot be done on the latter tracks. You can also collect power ups and use them at your will, and you can find both attack and defense ones. The last thing is the boost, which can be used only when it's full and can be refilled through a powerup or through jumping/sliding.This game comes with online/local multiplayer, and even with a track editor with Steam Workshop support, so there's a good amount of toys to play with.Other things worth noting, that cannot be found so often even in mainstream games, are a replay system, and even a photo mode.It may sound like such a great game from this description, and in fact the potential is there, but there's also many things done wrong here.The main problem is the engine used: Unity. Once again, it can deliver a game quicker than using a better one, but the problems it gives to the users are too many, especially on bigger projects.Super Toy Cars suffers from the usual performance problems that all Unity games suffers, although here they aren't as bad as in other games, but in a racing game, a framerate stutter can lead to a loss of control of the vehicle.This is an arcade racer so that's less important, but since I can play GRID2 in full HD, with 16xAF and 4xAA, with all settings to High and some to Ultra at a stable 60fps with the graphics you all know, I know that the very simple special effects used in this game (fake env-mapping for example) and the simple models should run smoother than it does, especially since this game is more suited to kids, and you usually don't give your kids the most powerful pc you have around to play with.The physics are also quite bad which, paired with really weird track objects bounding boxes, it can lead to moments of frustration.You may want to cut corners sometimes, because the game seem to push that strategy with a lot of cars that slides while just steering, and the fact that you obtain boost by doing so, and that you even have a button on your gamepad just for sliding, but the objects put on the track have strange bounding boxes which sometimes are smaller than the objects themselves, and sometimes are bigger, which leads you to hit your head into invisible walls that just shouldn't be there.The cars also becomes less controllable at times, especially while jumping and when the framerate stutters. Weird behaviors can also be observed while hitting other cars or any other object in the game.Other Unity-related problems are lack of support for dinput and older xinput gamepads (needing you to use x360ce), some weird audio-related glitches and general stability. The game didn't crash often (like twice so far in-game), but it crash on exit for some reason, like other Unity games that I have (no profile data loss anyway).I can't comment on the multiplayer as I could never find anyone playing this game and I don't have anyone to play with here.I can't comment much on the track editor either because I don't have time to learn how to use it, but I can comment on the fact that I hoped it would be easier to use. One little thing the devs can do is to add some tooltips on its GUI so that you can easily know what each button does, but I guess it won't need a lot of practice or a lot of reading to get used to it.The whole in-game shop is also looking like it was rushed, because you just can save up to power up your current car and you'll be able to win so many races, which leads to you save enough to buy a car powerful enough to win another 1/3 of the game. You can basically win the whole game with just 3 cars, and by that time you'll have enough money to buy the rest of them with their powerups, but that's probably because the game is easy and therefore more suited to kids.In fact, I see this game like a little gem for kids, as they can play a game that is easy enough for them, play local multiplayer or online with their little friends, and spend additional time using the built-in track editor to make their own track, that can be shared on the Workshop for everyone to enjoy (or hate).I have to thumb down this game because for my age and likings, this game does too many important things (for me) wrong and it's also too easy and short, but it would probably be a thumb up if I were a kid or if I had kids.I also know many people of my age that just can't drive serious racing games, and this game may be good for them too (lol).There's many other arcade racers out there which does things right, like Little Racers STREET, so consider the alternatives before buying this, unless, as I said, you need a game for your (young) kids.

												This game is merely a merely competent cart racing style game with absolutely nothing that makes it stand out. The vehicles handle pretty differently, but there's little reason to not use the fastest one you can afford. The collision detection isn't great, you can drive through some objects and get stopped by blank space sometimes.There's no real reason to play this over existing games in the genre like Mario Kart, Re-Volt, or RC Cars since it does nothing unique or exceptional.

Early Access Review
								Super Toy Cars is a terrible game. It tries hard to be Micro Machines, but fails in every aspect. The environments aren't even explorable, so you're just sitting racing on a track that looks like every track. If you try to veer off, you just get reset on the track. The game reuses these tracks over and over, so even though you just finished 15 races, you did them all on the same three or four tracks. The physics are terrible, and try too hard to be realistic. For example, a single tiny bump in the track can send your car flying, and if you don't hit jumps exactly dead on, your car will flip. This is not the kind of stuff you want to see in a fun racing game. The car upgrades are limited and I swear they don't help any. The drifting is as bad as the rest of the physics. So yeah. Don't buy it expecting a Micro Machines clone. It's bad enough as it is without comparing it to something good.			",373,64,10,65,16,2,24

												As a fan of Mario Kart who is forever looking for a good pc clone, this game got me excited, but I don't think I will ever play it again. If this was a game still in development I would be the #1 fan and avidly follow it, but as it is it just can't be enjoyed. First of all, the controls: pressing up will give a constant speed to your car, while left-right will change its angle. That's all. I wasn't expecting something super realistic from a toy car battle game, but I really need some more variables under my control if I must feel that I'm responsible for my results. To be fair, the cars have stats like ""handling"" and ""grip"" that you can improve by buying upgrades, it's just hard to imagine where they could be possibly used. The few times some physics seems in play it feels totally wrong. For example when it rains it's hard to turn, but it doesn't seem like water on the floor... more like water got into my keyboard causing it to malfunction. There are a few powerups, but they could be condensed in just two: ""hit the car behind you"" and ""hit the car before you"".And I was always winning first place without even thinking what I was doing. The problem is not that the game is too easy, but that the player is not responsible for the result. If the difficulty was increased, you would always lose rather than always win.There is little content. I played for one hour always going to the next challenge, and I think I only saw three different tracks. To add a bit more variety, there are four different modes: a normal race, a solo race against the clock, a mode where every 15 seconds the last car gets eliminated, and a fourth mode that is just like the third, but with random mines on the track. None of them got me involved.Besides all these problems, for some reason the game just isn't fun. The developers clearly tried to replicate the mario kart formula, but that isn't enough. It looks like they completely skipped the part where you tweak the game until you find a combination that makes it enjoyable.I really don't enjoy writing a review that is so negative, I guess I hope they read it and decide to go back working on this project (maybe as a new game). What I can't understand is that the big work seems already done. The graphics are cool, and the engine works, what's left to do is the fun part.I'm not bitter about this because I got the game in a bundle I bought for something else, but I certainly don't recommend you pay 9,99eur for it (or any price really).

												I went into this one with very low expectations, and it was better than I thought.This game has abundant minor issues and feels a bit unfinished.  It's got clunky hitboxes and glitchy hit detection; it's possible to drive right through stage walls in some places.  Collisions behave really oddly.  Powerups aren't too useful.   There's not too many pre-programmed tracks, either.Also, there's a highly overpowered mechanic called Drift; sliding around curves filles a boost gauge that can be activated for a major speed increase at any time; with a bit of skill, high drift cars will spend half of every race in turbo mode, and low drift cars will be left in the dust.  This limits your car choice options.However, there's positives, too.  A variety of game modes keeps things feeling fresh.  Races are fast-paced and don't drag on.  There's a fully functional track editor.  Vehicle handling is actually pretty okay.As a MAJOR plus, computer AI does not feel cheaty - Cheating AI is my major issue with most other racing games.  The game is fairly low challenge, but a large part of that is because the devs weren't seeking to add artificial difficulty with rubber-banding or any such rubbish.The verdict: There's fun to be had here, as long as your expectations aren't too high.  Fly through all those tracks with drift, buy a bunch of upgrades, snag a ton of easy achievements, and it makes for an enjoyable afternoon.			",154,112,2,28,17,3,20

												This was part of a bundle I bought,and while I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it,It's a bit of fun If you can get it cheap/in a bundle. You're going to want to select the ""hold to drift"" option,as not doing so means you have pretty much no control over the car whatsoever as it just auto-drifts all the time. I also recommend playing your own soundtrack in the background. Be careful for objects that look like you can go under/around them also,as some have invisible walls. Unlocking trophies and cars is fun,but it can feel a bit grindy after a while as the limited tracks and race types get repetitive. It's the sort of game you pick up every few days for a quick sesh,and community made tracks will breathe some new life into it. A fun,little time killer overall.			",377,32,23,25,24,9,10

												I went into this one with very low expectations, and it was better than I thought.This game has abundant minor issues and feels a bit unfinished.  It's got clunky hitboxes and glitchy hit detection; it's possible to drive right through stage walls in some places.  Collisions behave really oddly.  Powerups aren't too useful.   There's not too many pre-programmed tracks, either.Also, there's a highly overpowered mechanic called Drift; sliding around curves filles a boost gauge that can be activated for a major speed increase at any time; with a bit of skill, high drift cars will spend half of every race in turbo mode, and low drift cars will be left in the dust.  This limits your car choice options.However, there's positives, too.  A variety of game modes keeps things feeling fresh.  Races are fast-paced and don't drag on.  There's a fully functional track editor.  Vehicle handling is actually pretty okay.As a MAJOR plus, computer AI does not feel cheaty - Cheating AI is my major issue with most other racing games.  The game is fairly low challenge, but a large part of that is because the devs weren't seeking to add artificial difficulty with rubber-banding or any such rubbish.The verdict: There's fun to be had here, as long as your expectations aren't too high.  Fly through all those tracks with drift, buy a bunch of upgrades, snag a ton of easy achievements, and it makes for an enjoyable afternoon.			",154,112,2,28,17,3,20

												48 career races and a nice amount of cars, people keep complaining about this game, but i dont know why. its a fun mario kart spin-off for PC, and it looks and feels nice to play. You can easily get a couple hours out of this game, although, at full price, im not so optimistic about this game, but if you get it on sale for 3 bucks, i definetly recommend it.

												Not much to play. You've seen everything in two or three hours. Not worth the investment.			",41,1,1,5,1,0,1

												This was part of a bundle I bought,and while I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it,It's a bit of fun If you can get it cheap/in a bundle. You're going to want to select the ""hold to drift"" option,as not doing so means you have pretty much no control over the car whatsoever as it just auto-drifts all the time. I also recommend playing your own soundtrack in the background. Be careful for objects that look like you can go under/around them also,as some have invisible walls. Unlocking trophies and cars is fun,but it can feel a bit grindy after a while as the limited tracks and race types get repetitive. It's the sort of game you pick up every few days for a quick sesh,and community made tracks will breathe some new life into it. A fun,little time killer overall.			",377,32,23,25,24,9,10

												It sux wtf ? If another car it you, you crash and the game respawn you, if you hit the wall (or a lego (obstacle on the road)) you crash and the game respawn you, if another car run too fast and hit the back of your car, you crash and the game respawn you... Overall, with the sound/graphic the game sounds cheap and amateur...			",372,51,28,72,57,7,111

												The game have its limitations, but it 's pretty enjoyable. Fun physics and car interactions! Driving a toy car at max speed avoiding hitting cereal or chocolate has never been so much fun ;D			",154,24,13,9,11,1,14
