												Tricks are cool with RC cars, but combined with the pressure to finish 1st, this is one tough combination to master. Most of the faster cars have horrible handling making it downright impossible to avoid obstacles and keep up with the AI racers, but try to pick a car with better handling and you finish about 60 seconds behind due to the slow acceleration and top speeds. The extremely good AI racers take away a lot of the enjoyment of this game, and it's not a bad game by any means. It just needs a difficulty setting for casual players like me.

												Total blast from the past! I had this game for the PS2 back in the day. I'm so glad its here on steam.I would recommend this for anyone who likes R/C cars or action racing.Plus, the driving physics are acctually fairly real for R/C cars (other than the ability to jump on command.)Update:Fisrt off, if you're using a keyboard and mouse: RIP. You WILL need a controler for this game. Plus, it sucks that you can't set keycommands (or button commands or controler, you can only use the ones that they give you. Turns out the just first map is really the best (in terms of build quality.) The rest of the maps have a bunch of ""mystical walls"" or in other works invisible surfaces. With slower cars you don't really have to worry about these, but faster cars are required for certain races. Sometimes when you're flying down a stright-away your car just go flying to one side for no good reason. This can make it impossible to win some races against the OP A.I. with infinite N2O that was put in place for the ""Knockout Races.Despite its cartoony look, its very competative game and can be hard to beat with all these glitches.I'm still glad they tried to bring it back, but why reinvent the wheel?I might still recommmend this game if it goes on sale, but $10 is a f***ing rip-off. (glad I got it on sale.)If you're easily enraged; leave this page now/do not buy. If you don't mind the glitches mentioned, and like R/C cars; just get it when it goes on sale.(Sorry for typos, or misspellings, I'm stuck on this race where s*** keeps going wrong, and its p***ing me off.)

												Well, after playing the original smash cars on PC, this game feels like it's missing the fragile dynamics of the old game. It feels like motorstorm but with crappy dirt trails in the way cars handle, the menus are obviously console oriented and what happened to fast paced responsive controls?? Really disappointed, the original game has such cool physics yet this reeks of an unfinished console port for a casual audience.I recommend the original RC Cars game, though in 4:3 resolution, the graphics are not far apart, yet the gameplay is much better			",99,8,3,11,13,0,12

												I love just about everything about this game.  I love how the cars handle.  I love the environment for its novelty and variety.  I love pulling off the jumps.  I love ramming people in the shin and making them hop on one foot.  I love the music.  The difficulty is just right, so I'll play a track a dozen times to get that gold medal.  I've never been big on racing games, but I'm glad I discovered this one.			",251,48,1,16,8,2,23

												I found a level in this game i presume to be un-beatable, The Round time trial have any of you beat it? I think its a cheap tactic used by the developer to prolong the half decent game I would not recommend this title. If you like it great it's not for me i re-installed it today thinking why did I delete local files and now I remember...			",202,38,14,33,16,6,36

												Pretty fun little RC Car racing game. Some nitro action and jumps... What more would you want. For starters better Xbox 360 controller support. Currently my gas button is the controllers start button. Feels weird to play like that but at least it works. Unsure if im going to be able to remap them using 3rd party utilities or just Google... I like the game though.			",101,7,2,10,13,1,9

												If you're looking to running your own virtual RC race track, this game is for you! The ability to run your car into people's legs, boost and race in human territory makes the game incredibly fun and is a very non-serious racing game.			",2587,1027,102,247,386,37,416
