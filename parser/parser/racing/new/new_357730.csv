								Good start on a VR implementation of kart racing, similar to a famous plumber-themed game. There is a fair amount of camera motion so it's not for folks with weak stomachs (Blaze Rush is a better VR alternative for those players).Performance was good on a gaming laptop with Nvidia GTX 765M with a DK2 in extended mode so it should be fine on any decent VR rig. The UI is done nicely in a VR mode.Looking forward to seeing how the game develops. My only suggestion for improvement is that the scale of the player hands and steering wheel feel a bit large.

								Good start, works with Oculus perfectly (especially happy with direct mode instead of using extended desktop mode), but game itself is very minimal. It is more like technical demo than game and there is free VR Karts demo available too. Here are very minimal improvements compared to that free demo, therefore as of today I cannot recommend paying for that (unless if you want to just support developers). Looking forward for much more content, it has potential to be the best ""real game"" for Oculus. Idea itself is working very well. I'm going to change my ""not recommended"" to ""recommended"" when there will be more content- different maps, different music, possibility to save, some progressive game mode, multiplayer... right now its all missing.Update: changing my recommendation to thumb up as I see lots of improvements here.

								I don't know what game all those negative reviewers were playing, but this game is amazing. It feels like a VR Mario kart. The only thing I think I'd change would be to add difficulty levels for the Ai karts as I found it a little too easy.			",234,45,4,25,12,3,26

								Super smooth even on older hardware (gtx 650 ti).  Good driving feel.  However, the tracks all feel WAY too similar....all castle themed with only two very similar sounding songs.  Racing the same track over and over in the free demo feels no different than the retail version.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Love the idea, but there is not much content as it is. There needs to be more maps and more map types. More than that though, the maps need to be more unique and crazy, I would wait until a little more content is released.			",290,53,14,41,56,3,46

								This game shows alot of promise, but it's not there yet, specifically if you are playing on the pc with a keyboard, I couldn't figure out how to get the speed boost to work, and alot of the cool stuff like drifting isn't available.  I couldn't find a keyboard config menu item either.  The speed is also too slow, although I had it set to speed fast, and th turning is not great on the pc, it woudl be nice to have it be  perhaps more graduated or something or maybe if you hold shift to have 2 different angles of slight corner or sharp corner - it's possible to pulse the key so a sharper turn ange wouldn't hurt, but it's current turn radius is too shallow.3rd issue is I purchaed the full game but only had 2 tracks, I suspect something got messed up with the demo on his upload, hopefully he will correct this, and that I'm not mistaken, maybe it's a green light thing toFinally the kills are too long, they need to be about 1/2 the time, have more fun ones, and more stuff to catch up (like mario cart's bullet when you've pretty much lost all hope of making a comeback - remember it's a game which is to be fun, it's no fun if you know 1/2 thorugh you are going to lose)Having said that, it is a game that shows huge promise and it' is probably a much better game if you have a controller.  I am playing it on the occulus 0.7 driver and it works really awesome!   I had no crashes in the 45 mins I played which  is really a testimate to a pretty well put together game all in all for a single indie dev!			",167,64,14,33,21,4,19
