												It is a well done game, the level design, the graphics, the atmosphere are all fantastic. You should definitely get this game, it is fun, it handles well and you just need to see the environment for yourself.That being said, it isn't a flawless game. Now that I've completed it, I have two major issues with the game:- Most of the time, you'll get back to a previous checkpoint not because you died, but because you tried to go explore the environment, and you just reached the side of the corridor you were supposed to follow. This isn't much of a problem up until level 6, where checkpoints are scarce and it is not at all obvious where you're supposed to go.- The biggest issue, I think, is that in the two hours I've played this game, I've actually completed it, collected all orbs and have finished the three bonus levels as well.With that in mind though, I definitely recommend the game, I had fun with it. If it goes on sale, I'd say it's a no-brainer.			",129,24,3,13,18,4,32

												I would recommend this game. While it can be demanding on performance due to being built in CryEngine 3, it is absolutely beautiful. I have a GTX 660 TI and was running it on 1080p, getting 50-60 fps constantly. The only issues I experienced were occasional stutters, which lasted around a second at the longest, and only happened on level three.My only complaint was both the difficulty and length of the game. I was able to complete every level, including the four bonus levels, and collect every orb in around an hour and a half. The most difficult stage was absoulutely the last bonus stage, mostly due to its length and lack of checkpoints. The controls felt a bit floaty, but I adapted quickly and experienced little difficulty.Overall Rolling Sun is a beautiful game that I wish I could play more of. 7.5/10			",251,60,4,15,23,1,16

												This game went somehow far below my radar! Discovered it much later.If I had to describe the game with one word only: CUTE.The game is CUTE. Graphics are very nice (cryengine is well used and runs smooth), level design is sweet (very Trine-ish) and gameplay is extremely simple.You just go around in a 2.5 D environmente with this 'rolling sun'. You can collect orbs, but the main goal is just reaching the end of the levels. At the end of the level you get a new 'power' that keeps things spicy and interesting.This is a great game for kids or for anyone who likes simple games....and in this case it has also wonderful graphics which is a nice plus.Notes: it supports 360 controller, it supports ultrawide. Graphic settings are very limited (low-medium-high presets, resolution, nothing else) and the game feels quite indie-ish (cryengine default loading screen, for instance) but is really well made.

												Rolling Sun:~~~~~~~~~ In the wold of Incas and Mayans, Gods were really influential in their civilization. One of them is the Sun God! You will now represent this god through the ball of magic stone in this stunning 3d environment.  Rolling Sun is a platformer/ adventure game where you are in control of the ball of magic stone. You will have to show your skill to manoeuvre this globe through obstacles in these well-designed levels. This is all about dexterity and timing. Let me elaborate a little bit about it. . .  the physics of the ball are really well done and every small or subtle movement you make can determine really quickly whether you succeed a hurdle or have to start all over again.  On each level you will have to get all the orb stones without falling down crevasses or touch water and you will….. Guess what!! Do it again! You will be able to make your ball jump and this can led you to interesting situations, especially with these floating round platforms! These are very tricky to negotiate as they lean backward or forward if you do not land straight in the middle of them, which can influence whether or not you have to start all over again. Reach the end of a level and you will get a new ability.I am extremely impressed with the presentation of this game - graphically it is stunning. From the control point of view, either you use the keyboard or the gamepad; they are sensitive and will take you a little bit of time to get use to them but they are fine. The soundtrack is very good, too, and fits the game very well.Positive:~~~~~~~ -	Very well-designed levels-	Stunning graphics-	Very well pricedNegatives:~~~~~~~~ -	No achievements or trading cards-	No indicators to find out how many orbs you have to collectRolling Sun is very well presented with stunning graphics. A different and enjoyable platformer/ adventure game. Worth having in your game library!7.9/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

Teal DeerDevelopers: Mystik'ArtPublishers: Mystik'ArtInitial release: June 2015Genre: Platformer #Worth/NotWorth: #NotWorth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationYou know that Wizard guy from Trine that can draw a box? Well this is basically an entire game of that except the box is a ball and you have direct control. You are a ball and you roll to the right. There are 3 levels of fairly substantial length that checkmark periodically seemingly before any major obstacle.The game seems needlessly taxing on even middle tier systems with no real way to lower the settings. Particle effects mixed with physics are rampant and caused my frames to drop and stay down as things continued to “physic” around. I personally had a slight issue with the 3D elements. There are not planes as in such games like Little Big Planet but rather the entire area can be traversed; as someone who apparently failed the depth perception test in the USAF I found it a bit troubling to discern where I was in the field immediately. In my honest opinion I feel the game might have fared better had either the camera been free to move or planted directly behind the ball and had the action move forward. THE GISTSimple platformer, not much to it and overly taxing for basically no reason. It is indeed pretty but at what cost. If you can pick it up real cheap its totally fine for a couple minutes but as an overall product I don't recommend it at all. Follow my curation for more ",1041,295,48,106,93,7,96

												Sometimes it's just a hard to know how bad the controls and camera really are before you actually try the game. This is one of those games. Camera angles are terrible, controls are tough to master and game lags a bit even with a decent rig. I think this game would have been much better with third person camera angle. Game is really short and easy so it takes no time to finish it. Not even a worth of the 19 cents.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So disappointing is all I can think. For a rolling game the visuals are so nice. The Cryengine proves itself in the hands of Indy developers in still doing the best foliage around. But I can't help feel like this game could been so much more fun if the balls weight wasn't so heavy. It's really hard to keep momentum and you'll keep getting stuck. Going uphill is very annoying, even when it's only a 20° hill. There's a moment where they have a actual half pipe and you'd think you can build up the momentum to get the ball to get some air, but no it's just too heavy and is never able to get that speed. I just feel like this game with some minor changes to the balls physics and this could have been great fun, right now it's just a beautiful disappointment. Almost guys, but not quite.

												The music and graphics are great, don't get me wrong. Yet, it simply does not feel right. The controls are iffy. I understand the need to follow through on ""real"" physics but in the end this is a game and when you play you have to find a balance. I think they didn't find that balance. My first impressions are in the video below. I'd suggest only grabing this game when it is dirt cheap!

												Rolling Sun feels more like a half-finished thought than a complete game.You're a rolling blue ball that can jump.  You'll roll through some pretty envionments but that's really all there is to it.  Challengers seem to be more co-incidental than by design.  And are mostly the challenge is caused by the camera.  The ball is centered in the screen even though every stage scrolls to the right.  At speed you can jump significantly further than the amount of screen that can be seen.  This is a problem because it reduces landing to luck.  Or rolling very very slowly.The physics sections are silly, I'm on the third of what looks like six stages (in less than half an hour) and nothing I've encounted so far has needed more thought than mashing the jump button.  As long as a piece of stage mesh has been touched you can jump again so wall climbing is doable.  With that said the physics on the floating rafts is annyoing because they bob up and down quite fast; and impart interia when jumped off making it impossible to judge far you'll jump.There are switches in the game.  There should not have been switches in the game.  Rolling into a swtich triggers a long switch rotation animation which is bad.  Worse is that whatever is switched doesn't start animating until after the switch animation is over.  This makes it easy to trigger a swtich, wait, roll out of the switch and then roll down a hole because the platforms raised by the switch are still raising.  What was the point?  Everyting switchable could have been left permanently in place without the aggravation of having to switch itThere is no gameplay challenge.  There is no fail condition.   You can fall down holes as often as you like, you'll be placed back at the start of the jump afterwards.  There are blue balls to collect but no indication of how many you need to collect - if any at all.  There is no timer so there is no time pressure.  Roll slowly and you should have no problem at all.Lastly I've run into a few glitches in the short time I've played.  Big red textures saying replace me, getting stuck behind the far side of the level.  And still having ball control whilst being rescued from a hole.  When given the strafe power-up the jump button re-binds from A to Y and strafe left becomes A; which is confusing.All-in-all Rolling Sun is not a game I'd recommend unless you're looking for something very laid back.

												First off, this game has a lot of potential: it could be fun. The aesthetics have been done very well. However, there are a lot of big problems that led to me quitting within a few minutes. First, the controls are terrible and unresponsive. Your player jumps like a second after you press the button, and turns just the same. I tried adjusting everything to get that working, and I think that's just the game. Second, level design has some bad choices. I love challenge, but here it just becomes annoying. And, the choice of having invisible walls really messes with the aesthetics. I wouldn't recommend this, but I hope that this game can be a learning experience for the developers and lead to them developing something better next time			",61,18,0,6,0,0,2

												Pretty with soothing music, and that's about all the praise I can give it.  The physics is pointlessly frustrating.  Your ball has a ridiculous amount of inertia, meaning that most of your time is spent hitting obstacles and standing still -- even worse if you're trying to proceed upslope.  It gives you just enough side-to-side pseudo-3D ""freedom"" to screw you up by running you into ground roughness that throws you off your path and sends you into pits, and if you try to take advantage of that to find better routes, you run into invisible walls.  I am not an unskilled gamer (I've made it through most of I Wanna Be The Guy) and I still found myself stuck for upwards of three minutes after falling into the first pit in the first level.  The provided step isn't high enough for your jump to get you out, and trying to build momentum by running in circles in the pit slams you either into invisible walls or the step, both of which stop you dead, so you have to basically wade around in molasses until you manage to bounce off the step at just the right angle to hop back into play. That, and fighting with the game to gett its screen resolution right on my dual-monitor setup, was my entire 15-minute play experience.  Game deleted with prejudice.			",49,28,0,8,5,0,2

												Rolling Sun is a pretty simple and short platformer. The environments are fairly good looking which is the thing that stands out the most. The controls are okey though the third dimension took a little time getting used to. The biggest problem in my opinion about the game is that you simply die if you move too far away the the planned path in the third dimension. Some levels were designed so that this was not a problem but some levels were designed in a way that i often by accident died in this manner. Something else worth mentioning is that the game is very short, it took me around 1 hour to complete it. If you are simply looking for a ok platformer with nice visuals to spend an hour with then this game will probably not disappoint. But don't expect the world and make sure the price is right for the content. ",554,123,25,77,58,3,63

												This game is very promising. Built in CryEngine 3, it looks absolutely stunning!The gameplay can be difficult at times, due to the nature of being a ball, although I didn't have many problems. In fact, most of my deaths were due to collectables that you really can't reach without dieing, or purposly falling off the edge cause I missed one.The physics engine that is utilized with this is also perfect! Things feel like they have weight, and theres an obvious impact whenever you hit something.All in all, it's definitely worth a play (especially if you got it for around 15 cents like me).However, lets go back to my first sentence. It is promising. Throughout the game, I just couldn't help but look at it and say ""This would make a FANTASTIC Crash Bandicoot game!"". The world design, the platforming... Just pop in some enemies, more boxes, and an orange bipedal animal and you'd have something GREAT! Seriously. Creator. Take this game. Keep everything about it the same. But replace the ball with a character, have tight platforming controls, and THAT is a game I'd gladly pay $30+ for!			",155,15,6,12,6,1,25

												Nice Experience. Somehow this reminds me of a story I wrote once. This could be a nice interpretation of this.Now to the game. I finished this and I like it. But this game feels like an engine test. You have some passages where you can role through with the big rock. You should be able to play this game on highest game quality. With low graphic options this game nearly has nothing to offer. All is based on an ambientic feeling - provided by graphic.The game handling is nothing new. It is a 3D platformer with a big ball as protagonist.  But you have an interesting combination of mouse and keyboard controls in this. To be honest - you also can beat this game just by rolling and jumping. But the mouse controls give some nice extras on the later levels.The music is ... The sound quality is good. But the background music is extremely monoton. This is not nice and becomes an additional punishment when you need several tries to get through some passages. Some environment noises would have been nice. Like bats in the cave, birds in the jungle, etc.The game has weak points. And they are really really big - I have to admit. The idea of this game is based on that ambientic environment. But you are not allowed to explore. Sometimes you have interesting rooms around but you are not allowed to roll over to check what is inside. That is really a no-go. There are also some weird things happening. Some trees have some unfinished or undeleted collision events. On one tree you can roll against and an image with a big X appears. Sometimes save points have a really annoying placement. And at some passages the allowed moving area becomes so tight that small mistakes lead to a repositioning to the latest save point. And on the last level you really feel like the developers had no more fun at continueing this. It is like ""ah ♥♥♥♥... so much work to do. Lets copy&paste area segments"".But despite all those big weaknesses I enjoyed the ambientic experience in this game. It is like making holidays, wandering around and exploring new landscapes. But if you do not seek for something like this, do not buy it. If you think you can be satisfied with the ambientic thought you really could buy it. For that little price it is worth it.

												Ok, so I don't really do reviews but this game has been getting a lot of bad reviews and I thought I'd put in my two cents. Also, there is a chance I could end up rambling alot but whatever. So as I have seen in the reviews alot of people are having performance issues in this game which I have not seen any of using a gtx 970. The story is just about nonexistant just so you know. The game does look really beautiful but then again I don't really play platformers for their beauty or storyline so let's get to ♥♥♥♥ that matters. The gameplay is quite fun. I can't remember the last time I played a good momentum based platformer despite the fact that I really enjoy them so this game was very refreshing. The levels are really easy (at least when you use a controller. I haven't tried the game with mouse and keyboard) with frequent ""checkpoints"" so it is definitely a casual game. And it seems that the more abilities they add like double jump, dash, glide, etc., that the game gets even easier as the levels don't really make you use the abilities. You can go at least through level 5 only using your beginner abilities and double jump and my guess is it will be the same for level six as I haven't actually finished the game yet. Maybe I'll go back and edit this review then or maybe I won't because I'm a lazy ♥♥♥♥. Anyway, the game is really short. I've played 46 minutes so far and I am almost done with it so in total I would expect it to be less than an hour. That being said the game is only five dollars to buy which is about the same amount I would pay to rent a movie. So yeah, overall I really like this game but I could definitely see how someone could be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off if it didn't run. If it is as ♥♥♥♥ed as people say it is on their computers the devs should really get that fixed. But if your willing to risk throwing away five dollars at the chance that this fantastic game will work correctly for you I would definitely give it a shot.Edit:There are a few more critiques that I forgot to mention of this game. First off the camera angle can get really weird on occation. Almost all the time throughout the game you go from left to right but at random points the game make it so you have to start heading away from or towards the camera to progress. Personally I don't mind having to move away from the camera but having to move towards the camera and have no sight of where you need to go next is really annoying. Other than that, I have finished the game now and played the three bonus levels. I do not plan on going back into the game to replay the levels that I missed orbs on to unlock the ascension level as I think this game is fun to play but not as much to replay. All levels including the bonus levels took me 72 minutes to complete.			",139,26,1,12,13,0,11

												Case in point for the statement ""Beautiful graphics don't make a good game"".- You cannot play on any other resolution than the standard 1280x1024. You can try to change it, but it'll crash when you try to start the actual game.- Loading times for everything. Even for quitting the game, or returning to main menu from the settings menu - makes the game reload again. My PC is pretty good and loading only took some seconds, but if it struggles a bit, I can already image the pain- Did you know this game was made with Cryengine? I mean, you'll only see it mentioned 6 times before you start the game. Not really that 'bad', but still annoying- the game itself isn't even fun. I tried to find it fun, but within the first few minutes, I knew enough. It's a 3D platformer with a rolling rock. Hardly has any decent physics. Got stuck? Have fun restarting the level.Skip this game, there are better platformers out there.			",723,220,14,80,66,8,94

												Rolling Sun is a pretty game.A pretty bad one.This game might as well be an advertisement for the Cryengine’s resources; this game makes use of the Cryengine’s built-in resources to build a very pretty game. There’s beautiful landscapes, nice vistas, breathtaking rivers…And very little fun to be had, sadly.The game itself is a basic platformer. You control a spherical rock (possibly one of the stone spheres of Costa Rica, though it has ornate, glowing designs over the surface), and this matters – your rock will roll off of inclined slopes and has a fair bit of weight to it, which can tax some of the floating platforms. You start off having only the ability to roll around and jump, but over the course of the game you acquire the ability to double jump, air dash, and float (a much slower rate of descent) at the end of the second, third, and fourth levels respectively. While this sounds like it would add more gameplay, it honestly doesn’t; double jumping is the only ability that actually ends up important, and while you can use the other abilities, they’re never really necessary.The game consists of six fairly short levels with checkpoints distributed throughout them. The checkpoints are invisible but are mostly fairly generous, with the exception of the end of the final level, where it feels like half the level feeds off of one checkpoint. Not that it really matters in terms of difficulty; there’s only a few sections (such as one bit where there’s a moving platform underneath you that moves forward, reassembling itself before you – with or without you, if you’re too slow) that are really challenging platforming.Instead, the game has the lovely aspect of being “3D”, but being more like those old beat-’em-up games where you can move across a narrow space, but are mostly just moving left to right. However, if you move outside of these bounds, sometimes you’ll run into an invisible wall (okay), and sometimes you’ll get picked up by a floating Mayan mask which drags you back to the last checkpoint as if you fell off the level. This discourages you from poking around and exploring… not that there’s anything to explore, really.It takes until the third level of the game for it to do anything different, at which point it starts having sections that lead away from the camera into the distance (and, at a few painful points, head towards the camera, which thanks to the narrow field of view makes it hard to see where you’re going).Each level is filled with collectables – namely, a small floating rock with a blue field around it. They’re basically the game’s equivalent of coins, and they’re all over the place and mostly are used to show the proper way forward. If you collect every one of them in every level, you’ll unlock four bonus stages, which are shorter than the main levels and contain no checkpoints and the most challenging platforming in the game (though they’re still not all that hard).The further the game goes on, the weaker it gets; the first few levels feel fairly organic, but by the end of the game it often feels fairly arbitrary in terms of the level design, and the graphical quality also declines in the second half of the game, with pop-in issues rearing their head in the fourth level, followed by a rather drab nighttime level and a final snow level which is very generic and doesn’t even let your ball make paths in the snow in its wake.All in all, the game is just not worth it. It is about an hour and a half long if you want to get and play all the content, but there’s really just not much here; very basic platforming with mediocre at best level design consisting of platforms, bridges, and similar things over bottomless pits. There aren’t any enemies to speak of, no story… it is just a rather empty experience.Pretty, but pretty pointless to play. ",507,173,10,70,51,7,84

												A lot of reviews complained about this game, especially the performance, but when I saw that it was 49 cents I decided to give it a shot. Performance: On my older mainstream enthusaist computer (i5-750, 760 GTX), I was getting good framerates on High graphics @ 1080p. I'd guess about 45-52 FPS. No screen tearing at all. At the beginning of stage 3 there is a really choppy part - there's some kind of optimization error there and I had to reduce it to Low graphics @ 800x600 -- luckily, no restart is required for any graphics changes so I just made it past that part and put the graphics back up. The game is a little short -- I beat it my first time playing, in about 1.5 hours. I died quite a few times but you start back at a checkpoint. There are some extras and bonus levels you can unlock. There doesn't seem to be any statisics tracking or goals. The game should have allowed you to try to beat your time and other things but there's nothing to it but to make it through the level. Also, it seems like the ball could have had a higher top speed especially downhill. They never explain why you are collecting the orbs but you'll notice that you need to collect all the orbs to unlock some bonus levels. The game doesn't have the polish of a Nintendo game or anything but it's also not $50.00. The graphics are very good especially on the last stage; the sound is just the basics; the music is okay but there are only 2 songs which alternate and get tiresome; the control is pretty good but they could have taken it a step further and changed the handling based on the surface like sand or ice; the physics are pretty good; the level design is pretty good; the ability to gain powers is pretty cool but mostly only the double jump gets used. It just seems like the developers got bored of working on this instead of spending the time it would take to make the game special and hold your interest. Pretty much the entire time I played I wished that they would have used this game world for an RPG or hack and slash platform game instead.I own thousands of games and don't normally play games for this long so I guess I enjoyed the challenge and appreciated that I didn't have to start over from the beginning when I died which allowing me to enjoy the entire game. I recommend it on sale if you have a decent computer and don't mind switching the graphics low in the first part of stage 3.			",514,152,39,89,25,3,79

												So I am running on a GTX 970, with the game on high. I completed all of the normal levels, and attempted the bonus levels (but I suck at platformers and give up too easily, so never completed them). I get a consistent 62fps in 1080 resolution on ALL levels, I had no problems graphically at all, no crashes, nada. (However, anyone else notice the tiny red placement markers for missing graphics now and again? XD Really not obvious but quite funny).It's quite a beautiful game, but motion blur is a thing in it as you move which makes it blurry so if you are particulary sensitive to that it cannot be turned off. Without the bonus levels, but with them unlocked, I played for a little under an hour. I actually really enjoyed it. The difficulty - respawn at checkpoints in the main game, is ideal for me as I do give up too easily. The progression is good with the skills. This ""ease"" is balanced out by the fact that the extra unlocked levels do not have these checkpoints so add more of a test for those more patient than myself.I wouldn't review, except that this game has a poor rating which I don't think is entirely deserved. It has been included in bundles, and has been on sale for a very small price ($0.49). It really was a pleasant experience. (The music is a little repetative but for the playtime it's certainly not THAT bad to deal with, in general I liked it). And for less than full price it's a nice little hour or twos game. A simple little experience, but worthwhile.			",335,293,9,51,66,3,34

												I got this game like dirt cheap. It was a part of some bundle of bundles. Ohh bundled games... there's always a few in there that will never sale alone... The trailer looked cool so I figure why not give it a try. This game will not play smoothly on most systems. Correction, the first level did run ok. It was the next level that cause the problem. It has good graphics for its genre (a bit overkill if you ask me) but I think they should have focused on making sure the gamer could get a decent amount of frames per second (fps). I don't think the Cryengine was needed for a game that mimics sonic the hedgehog as if he's stuck in his spin move for the entire game. The physics are kinda cool but if you do not get decent fps you will not enjoy it for long. It actually becomes a negative when the frames slow down to almost 0.3 fps.Now my system is not the best but its not the worst by a mile. This game took 0.6 hrs of my life and have nothing to show for it.  Thank's a lot Rolling Sun.			",234,17,6,39,7,1,8

												This game is a mixed bag for me.  It definitely shines with the graphics, they are stunning.  The world looks fantastic.   I was getting 60fps using my GTX 980 on a standard 1920x1080 display, and today (after an upgrade) I was getting around 40fps on my 3440x1440 display, which still loooked amazing.  The point there is, even though this game is included with some cheap bundles, it is rather demanding on your hardware.  Gameplay is where the mixed bag truly begins... the controls are simple enough, but the responsiveness of the 'avatar' leaves much to be desired.  I get that it is a giant stione ball, but still, it shouldn't be impossible to control.  The double jump and boost abilities are a necessity.  The levels are well designed, but the choice of camera angle is absolutely terrible.  There are times when you are rolling towards the camera and the platforms are impossible to predict.  This would be less annoying if the reset set-off wasn't so gosh-darned finicky.  Overall, it is a game with solid potential held back from some control issues and camera angles.  If you love great graphics and have a lot of patience for platformers with finicky controls, this is for you.			",72,5,0,16,2,0,6

												I feel like the game could have been better as a full 3d physics based platformer but had my share of fun with it for the 20 cents I spend. It's actually just a 2d roll a rock experience which isn't very difficult. The collectables are all over the place, and there is pretty much one track only for 99% of the time. Seems extremely broken and at times is a bit boring. One of the abilities in particular is really broken,  Double Jump  jumping against walls and spamming jump	 which was the main fun, the other abilities weren't as much use at all.

												Rolling Sun is an interesting platformer that has physics to make rolling a ball around more realistic. I paid 50 cents for it when it was on sale during the summer.Pros:- Very pretty graphics. I loved the look of the water and the foliage.- The soundtrack was nice- At times the game strayed from the same old side scrolling movement, which I enjoyedCons:- At the beginning of the game I had a problem with my ball being flung to the edge of the map, and I'd get stuck in some kind of green meadow. That was annoying.- This game is way too performance intensive for what it is.- The respawns were horrible. I don't understand the purpose of catapulting me far away because I missed one jump trying to get a orb.- You can't stop the game in the middle of a level. None of the levels are long, but if for whatever reason you exit the game in the middle of a level, you have to start from the beginning.- No achievements! What game nowadays doesn't have achievements?- Not only do you 'die' if you fall into a hole or water, but you can also die if you go too high. That made no sense.- There should be some kind of counter for the levels to tell you how many orbs you missed.- Slow loading! It takes a bit for the main menu to load your level progress! Since I paid less than a dollar, I think I got my money's worth out of Rolling Sun. However, for $4.99 I don't think it is worth it. This game has too many flaws.There are no jump scares.

												I bought Platformer bundle along with this graphical benchmark for supercomputers. Unfortunately, I don't have any supercomputers lying around my home.Pros:+ You can test you GPU overheating;+ You have a choice between 20, 15 and 10 fps, which correspond to 'Holy ♥♥♥♥, it's beautiful!', 'Even this ♥♥♥♥ outside worse than the graphics of this game!' and '♥♥♥♥! Even real girls aren't so damn beautiful!' graphics mode.Cons:- Sluggish control;- Anytime this game starts on the highest setting and with a wrong screen resolution;- You have a choice between 20, 15 and 10 fps.Result:Buy it at a big discount, if your computer is very tolerant to non-optimized games with pretensions on the original appearance.

												This game looks fantastic.That's also where most of the good things end.It's not really a game, it's a playable Tech demo of what the cryengine is capable of.You roll a ball through a beautiful forest, cave, island and mountain setting, gain a few extra abilities on the way and then reach the end of the level of which there are six, plus three very short bonus levels and one challenging extra level.On the way you can collect glowing orbs and if you collect them all, the bonus maps get unlocked.That's it, there is nothing more to it.The game demands a lot of hardware power to run fluid with best graphic settings, of which there is only the resolution to adjust.The controls are sometimes difficult to handle and i think the penalty for getting out of the borders (you get reset to a previous checkpoint) is a bit too unnerving, when a simple invisible wall could've done it as well.Breaks the flow of the game too much if you have to wait for the big mask to drop you off again.That should've been reserved for pits and the like, not because i moved an inch too far into the background.Overall i don't recommend the game, unless you get it for a couple cents or free.Remember: you need a strong machine to make the most of it.

												Runs like a fat cow on antidepressants. Crashes miserably to desktop as soon as you change the graphic settings (CRYENGINE SDK has crashed...) and therefore fails to save them (you're stuck with the defaults). When you manage to make it work, has one of the worst gameplay ever seen, especially for a game where controlling your ball and keeping its momentum is crucial. Graphics are ugly, yet static meshes and textures take 2-5 seconds to load. Objects around are constantly clipping as you move. Lastly, whoever designed the main menu has never heard about the concept of UX (yes, they even managed to fail at making a proper main menu). Refund requested.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent. You got me just what I needed quickly: double-jump and camera panning. Butter-smooth levels and controls turned into fast hills, tricky balance and technical challenge - deep level design! Great challenge and tempo. Overall a top-notch experience. My minor gripe is with controller support in the graphics options menu: The cursor position was not visible for confirmation. Note also that between loading levels sometimes the screen would flash patterns for a few milliseconds. As I said: minor! At worst a brief mouse moment in an otherwise flawless, smooth experience.

												The game controls feel somewhat strange to begin with but after 15 minutes or so I got the hang of how the ball moves and it started being fun. The majority of the game is quite satisfying, challenging but not frustrating. In some places it can be annoying where you fail and the checkpoint turns out to be ages ago especially when you have not fallen but simply drifted off course because it is not clear where the edge of the allowed path is.The music is okay but gets repetitive quickly.The graphics are very detailed but quite blurry. My computer is well above the recommended specifications and even it struggled a bit on the last level.The game is relatively short. There are 6 levels and 4 bonus levels which can be completed in less than 3 hours.So overall this game okay but nothing spectacular, just be wary about the hardware requirements.

												87 minutes to beat just the first level of a total count of 3, one more likely than not worse than the other, the 360° controls you'd usually use a gamepad's control stick for are almost unplayable using the arrows keys or WASD. The camera is restricting you to where it wants to be and even if you remain idle the ball moves so you can't leave the game out of pause to gather yourself without ending up somewhere entirely else where you left off. Checkpoint system is a pain in the neck as it doesn't tell you when and/or where you'll pick off next time once you fell, at least you have infinite retries and not the possible luck of running into a Game Over and having to start over the whole level. But that doesn't change that some balance parts are just rage positive and I ended up screaming my way to the end of the level. The game has an interesting base concept but it unfortunately went down with controls that will make everyone lose their temper, not even it being a part of the platformer-sale while the game itself is 0.19 isn't an excuse to how bad the controls are. The game itself isn't difficult, just dealing with the controls is. Going to add a few plus points to the ambience capturing soundtrack, graphics and atmosphere but even then that's nowhere near enough positive things to give this game a positive rating.

												Bought from a bundle, I loved it ! If you want to laugh, take it. Here's reasons why :- If you run it while you're not on desktop but on chorme for exemple, it'll open a window in a corner of the screen and you'll have to wait until it is fully charged to exit and re-run it in order to open it correctly.- Cryengine, ""Cry"" is appropriated for how my pc is on it's knees when it is running. Even in the lowest graphics mode, it is slow and lags (high = beautiful; low = beautiful + blurred).- When you fall in a pit and the mask ""rescues"" you, you can hear the bump sound if it lifts you up and encounters any platform above. And after being rescued, normally the camera returns at your last invisible checkpoint but if you jump, the ball disapears.- You can't change keybord controls, it is predefined and I was trying to do something but I ended up blocked on the first level).Good idea but unlike sonic, speed in this game isn't always the best thing (I'm not keen on playing with keybord). But graphism (and bundle reduction) were great. ",32,5,0,2,8,0,0

												Nice looking game with possible interesting gameplay (imagine old Balance with more freedom), but all is ruined with terrible horrible controls! It is a pure pain to play this game via keyboard. Also WASD+Spacebar are only and concrete hardcoded controls - so if you are not on WASD (like me) - you pain will be twice... Also control mechanics is buggy and clunky. Some time you Ball runs by itself and you need to tap that ♥♥♥♥ung wasd to release it. Also some jumps are leads into some miliseconds freezes and then suddenly push you Ball into orbit. I am just command myself to finish very first level. This is an endless pain... Too sad that such a good eye-candy idea was buried under the heavy stone of dead controls. Don't even try if without gamepad.			",405,153,2,8,3,0,7

Challenging since you are a ball which can jump (double!) but cannot go up the slightest incline. It also has rails, but you don´t know where they are, if you step out of bounds, or if you fall into water not even deep, you are forced to be respawned (glitchly) to a checkpoint.Wish it were what I expected, good I payed only a few cents.

												Great potential for a nice and relaxing game turned out to a boring and too challenging game. Challenging since you are a ball which can jump (double!) but cannot go up the slightest incline. It also has rails, but you don´t know where they are, if you step out of bounds, or if you fall into water not even deep, you are forced to be respawned (glitchly) to a checkpoint.Wish it were what I expected, good I payed only a few cents.

												Ok first off as you will see in many of the comments below if you want to run this game at max graphics u need a pretty decent machine. That being said the graphics are beautiful!!! As far as story line there really isn't any. Some Mayan god statue brings a ball to life to roll thru the course and collect little blue balls (very important as collect all of em will unlock 3 simple bonus stages and unlimited acension which is probably the hardest map) As far as how hard the game is it's pretty simple easy to control (at least if you're playing with a controller like me) My dislikes on the game is sometimes the path at clearly marked so it'll put u back at a checkpoint randomly. Pretty short game took 1 1/2 hrs to 100%, and the fact that there no achievements. Got this game in a bundle pack so only paid round a buck for it so twas a buck well spent.			",42,3,0,9,3,0,0

												Have not played for long, once I set the graphics it ran well. It is very easy to get stuck. It is like a  modern Marble Madness ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble_Madness ) but not as good, and  there are no points or time limits. I only recommend if you like frustration.This game could have been much better with probably not much more work.The ball needs more power to get it through uphill obstacles. I am currently giving it a 5 out of 10, but could be a 7 with some minor adjustments.			",18,8,0,2,0,0,1

												The phyics is slow and floaty, and is nothing like Sonic or Super Monkey ball witch are both great games. Dispite the graphics being great, it needs to have a beefy computer to run it because of all of the overly complex texures. I only bought it because it came bundled with other cheap games for a good price. Rolling Sun falls short because it could be a simpler game that is what it is, a game that will entertain you for five minutes to pass some time instead of a grand masterpeice worhty of the cosmos.

												Here's the rundown:You're a rolling ball with tribal markings. Why? ♥♥♥♥ if I know.You've gotta roll through levels to the end. Why? ♥♥♥♥ if I know.You should pick up shiny orbs as you progress. Why? ♥♥♥♥ if I know.This game is a whole lotta nothing. It's pretty and it has physics, and that's about it. Level design is atrocious. It's 3D but would've been better in 2D. There's platform physics, but sometimes that means jumping on platforms floating in water. If the platform dips a little because you didn't land perfectly in the middle, guess what? Lakitu decides you fell in anyway and takes you back to a checkpoint.Whoa what a surprising twist! I thought I was gonna cross over that bridge but that Lakitu guy cut it and I fell into the water below! Then he fished me out! Why? ♥♥♥♥ if I know.You know what's a great idea? Make some levels with the progression towards the camera so you can't see where you're going!Make a double jump ability that kills all x-axis momentum!Make the game use 100% cpu power to get 40 fps! Who uses GPUs anyway.Make sure some inputs stay locked in so you can't control your speed sometimes!Make sure you reuse entire level sections, but at night time so they can't tell!Every loading screen and pause menu has the Cryengine splash on it. Sometimes you run into walls that have red blocks saying ""REPLACE ME."" This is a glorified tech demo that someone wanted to make a quick buck off of. My friend bought this for me for 50 cents to make me squirm.He succeeded.			",162,33,1,16,9,0,17

No firing weapons.Ball is always rock, can't change to wood or anything else.Ball is very awkward to control and that is the game.No achievements.Summary: no je ne sais quoi, just pretty graphics with a rolling ball that's hard to control, that's it, there game needs a twist.

												The Decision if i would recommend this Game wasnt that easy. First things first: I love the graphics and the ambiente of this little Plattformer, and thats also why i would recommend this. The Gameplay and the levels are somehow repeditive and not really challenging and also pretty short (I played through all the levels in about an hour or so).So IF you -like me- play games just for theyre stunning graphics and IF you have a good discount on this one (full price is to high in my opinion) ---> buy it :D			",92,22,5,15,16,0,8

												The graphics are pretty, and that's about all I can say for it.  The controls feel slow, there's little challenge, and when it's challenging it's more because of bad controls than anything.  The level design is boring and repetitive, from what I saw before I quit (the first level of three).  While it presents something pretty to look at, and a not-completely-trivial task to do, it just doesn't feel much like a game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First level I would assume would be an introduction level, as it is standard for most games, however the level was very long compared to a simple introduction.The controls while better than other similar games, are still hard to get a good hand on, and you cannot see that much forward, I would have liked if it were posible to zoom out a bit, or change camera angle.But if you liked crash bandicoot when you were smaller, you might like this as well, as the feeling is pretty much the same.
