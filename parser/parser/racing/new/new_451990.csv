Early Access Review
A need for speed braking early before a turn so you don’t flip the car. Cranks & Goggles is a simulation-focused, top-down racing game which recently released on Steam through the Early Access program. C&G features twenty-six different cars across four different classes from the 1920’s and 1930’s. You can race these cars on sixteen tracks from across the world either through the game’s Quick Game mode or the Career mode with a multiplayer mode planned for later in development.Being a racing game, most of your time in C&G will of course be spent racing around a track in your car and let me tell you, it’s rather challenging. It turns out that race cars from the 20’s and 30’s, fitted mainly with thin tyres and driving on predominantly dirt/sand tracks are fairly difficult to handle. The cars aren’t all the same though, even within a class there’s huge variation. The car you start with in the career mode is reasonably stable and is capable of turning at speed without losing traction but then one of the ‘better’ cars in the class is much faster but I found I couldn’t go around corners as fast without losing control. The actual vehicle physics in the game are very good (although it does go a bit crazy sometimes when you crash into something) and it seemed fairly realistic to me, though I’m by no means an expert on how 20’s and 30’s cars handle.While some cars may look better than others on paper, how well you perform in a race really comes down to how well you can drive the car you’re using. When I started doing C Class races in the career mode I had enough money to buy the best car (on paper) so I did. When I started using it I realised that despite it having the best stats I really didn’t like it so I went back and bought a different car and ended up doing far better in the races with it. It does take a while to familiarise yourself with how a car behaves, it took me a few attempts to perform well with the first D Class car but once I’d got the hang of it I had great fun.That’s one of C&G’s greatest strengths, the variation between all the cars. You can ‘perfect’ your performance with one car but as soon as you buy and start using a new car it’s like you’ve completely started over and you have to learn how to play the game again. I found that it took me at least one full race (three laps) to get to grips with a new car and considering each class has four races followed by an event (apart from A Class which has three events) I’d say that’s pretty good. Those looking for a more casual experience might not be so keen on it but I find the variation helps keep the game interesting over the course of the career mode and it also adds to the overall realism.Sticking with in-game variation, there’s also a good amount of variation with the game’s sixteen currently available tracks. Some tracks see you hurtling through the Italian countryside, some tracks take you to the Middle Eastern desert and some have you flying around tight corners in an English port. I’m presuming that more tracks will be added since it’s in Early Access at the moment but even if there aren’t any plans for more tracks I’d say that the sixteen in the game offer enough variation for the game’s reasonably small asking price.  There are a couple of tracks which are just different versions of one another but other than that they’re unique tracks from across the world.Although I’ve enjoyed what I’ve played of Cranks & Goggles so far, I do have a couple of problems with it. My first problem is that the AI opponents don’t always appear to react to the player. There were a number of occasions where, due to what my car was doing, I would have expected a nearby opponent to change their course to avoid me but they didn’t. My other main gripe with the game is that you can’t sell any of your cars which means that if you don’t have enough money for a car that you need/want you’ll have to go back and re-play races you’ve already done. Lastly, there’s no opponent difficulty option. I found this frustrating because, while I found the D Class races to be fairly challenging, I found the C Class races to be far too easy. It would have been nice to have the option to increase the difficulty of the C Class races I found particularly easy. I didn’t find any of these issues to be bad enough to detract from my overall enjoyment of the game but they’re definitely worth considering.The only other issue I had was with the way the Quick Game mode works in the game, though I’d imagine most people will be playing the game’s career mode anyway. The problem is, you can’t choose what car or track you want to play on, it’s random. Not only would it be more enjoyable, in my opinion, if you could choose the car and track, it’d also be quite helpful for choosing what cars you want to buy in career mode which would help avoid wasting your race winnings on a car you end up not liking. There are a couple more things which, while not really issues, could use some improvement. Personally, I’d like to see either a bigger mini-map or a more zoomed out mini-map. Since you can’t see too far ahead you’ll rely on the mini-map for knowing what’s coming up and while the currently implemented map is acceptable, it’d be good if you could see a little further ahead with it just to make it a tad easier to prepare for turns. The other thing is I’d like to see full controller support. The store page does say C&G has partial controller support but the in-game control options won’t let you bind controller inputs so I’m not quite sure what the partial support is. C&G plays surprisingly well with KB&M but it’d be great to at least have the option of using a controller.Just a couple of small details I’ll wrap up my review with. At the start of your career game you can create a custom driver, editing their helmet, goggles, facial hair and face shape/colour. The portrait you create is used for the end-of-race leaderboard but what you choose also changes how the driver of your car looks. After purchasing cars you can buy upgrades for them. There are two upgrades for every car and what the upgrade changes (out of Handling, Acceleration and Speed) seems to depend on the car rather than its class. Just as the prices of the cars increases with ascending class, the price of upgrades increases too. However, if you’ve got the cash to splash they’re worth picking up. Lastly, the game has a great 20’s/30’s soundtrack which plays on loop in the background. It helps to make the game feel authentic and it is genuinely good music though they seem to repeat quite regularly so it might be nice to see a couple more songs added in.Verdict Cranks & Goggles is a thoroughly enjoyable simulation-focused, top down racing game with plenty of car and track variation. It’s well priced for what’s offered in the game and with more content coming (including multiplayer) as it progresses through Early Access I’d say it’s well worth picking up for fans of racing games.Lone Ranger Reviews.El K.

												First off, the people who say that this game has unrealistic psychics and is too hard obviously doesn't know much about old racecars. The cars back in the 1920's handled like a fridge and the grip was basically non-existant.I can't deny that it is pretty difficult though but it's like the devs say, it's a mixture between arcade and simulation and it's leaning a bit more towards simulation so it ought to be a challenge, and it is.It does take a couple of hours to get used to the handling but if you don't ragequit and you actually somewhat learn the feel of the cars, you can get some really fun, intense and a lot of the times, nerve wracking racing.This isn't Assetto Corsa or F1 2016 so you can't throw the car into a corner and expect it to stay stable and keep the grip. You need to really feel the car with a mix between the gas and the brake to try and learn how you can keep the car straight and keep as much traction through the corners as possible.This game does have a really cool sort of minimalistic theme to it which shows that you don't need a lot of details in a game to make it look pretty and I think this game pulls it off well. It makes the game a bit more relaxing in a way because there isn't a bunch of things in your face at all times. It also has some nice oldschool music to give you that early 1900's feel and although I usually don't care too too much about music (especially not in a racing game) it does make a good addition to get you in the feeling.There is a fair bit of content aswell with 26 cars and 16 tracks in 6 different countries (Including Sweden. Yay!) and for quite a ""small"" game for only 5,99€, I would say that this is definitely a good amount of variety in content. The cars aren't reskins either. Like it would be in real life, every car has it's own feel and it's own unique thing about it. Some cars might accelerate faster and some might be a bit more focused on handling and keeping the car a little more stable than the others. It's up to you to choose what you like the most and what you prioritize higher. It varies quite a lot when it comes to the tracks as well and they don't just feel like the same track over and over again (that's the feeling I got atleast) and like you would expect, there are more technical tracks and there are faster tracks so everybody can hopefully find one they enjoy driving on.Like all games, it isn't perfect but for what you're getting it isn't really that big of a deal, in my opinion. However for example. The AI can do some pretty stupid moves sometimes which leaves you on the grass facing the opposite direction when you didn't do anything wrong. I suppose there are also some other minor things that could use a change but nothing that I'm too bothered about. For the fair price of 5,99€ I would say, pick this game up if you like challenges and/or racing games because you can definitely get a lot of fun out of it if you give it a chance and put some time into it! For what you're paying, you really a decent amount of cars to aquire and tracks to beat in the career and time trial. It's also a good game if you have some time to kill as a race usually only takes around 5 minutes. Now, if you're interested but don't feel like it's worth it for whatever reason. Atleast wait until it's on sale and buy it then because it really isn't a lot of money and you might get surprised.I'm not too experienced will full on serious reviews so please do excuse me if I made any potential mistakes!

												So far I have played the first four races.Music and sounds are great. Difficulty is well balanced between arcade and simulation. Graphics are brilliantly stylized. Multiplayer feature is another plus and so are achievements. I used an Xbox One controller and had no issues. AI is so good it feels like racing against actual players.A must have for the enthusiasts of the genre! And if you are not, there is still high possibility that you may love it.

												Just finished the career mode and I thought I would write a review.I especially love the graphics and music design of this game which helped me calm myself down in potentially rage quit situations. Because...Cars are generally a challenge to drive as braking and some skill in balancing the car is required in this game. Especially for those cars with high handling stats. DON'T BE FOOLED BY THOSE STATS. They are a lot more tail happy which is detrimental to your lap times in most of the circuits. I learnt to choose a lower handling stat car which made it more stable and drivable to give you a consistent time. After playing this game, I have also learnt to appreciate downforce in modern cars more. :)Track layouts are also pretty cool too. All in all a great game, worth the money. ",21,2,20,1,8,0,0

												Certified fast, in the 20s at least.I love the aesthehics and charm of this game. It's too bad I suck at it, I'm thinking it might be a tad too difficult to control the cars but I know those things were basically shopping trollies with engines.Now what I'd really love to see from the developer is a follow up game that shifts the time period to the age of aerodynamics, I seriously love this art style and the attention to nostalgia details right down to the music. I would die to see the same done for the other famous eras of the previous millenium!			",102,5,20,10,5,3,13

Early Access Review
								Cranks And Goggles:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Let’s jump back in time! What about the 1920’s when we used to call racing drivers, “DAREDEVILS”, and they truly were! Driving at speeds above 190 km/h in a big tin can with four wheels without any power steering or automatic gearbox, just a small helmet and a pair of goggles - what an era! Have you got your goggles? Great, me too! Let’s crank our engines and go racing in the 1920’s! Cranks And Goggles is a top-down racing game set in the 1920’s. As you launch the game, the first thing you will be doing is to customize your driver. It took me quite a while do so, not because it was difficult, just because I was drifting from side to side listening to these fabulous 1920’s tunes!  After drifting to the music and setting up your racer, you will arrive at the lobby screen with a sum of money that has been allocated to you. From here, you can either go to the garage or go racing. At the garage, you will be able to see cars from all classes (D to A), with their specifications, which are: handling, acceleration and speed, of course. You can purchase new cars if you have the money, and upgrade them too. Each class has four tracks to race and if you successfully step on the podium (1st, 2nd or 3rd) in each of those races, you will unlock a championship for that particular class before moving up to the next one. The only difference in these sequences is that you will unlock three championships if you triumph in the class A. Each win comes with prize, which is a large sum of money. Accumulate the wins and the money so you can upgrade your car at the garage, or buy your next car. Races are usually between two to three laps with six racing drivers, including yourself. Depending which car you are using, you might find yourself off the mark in terms of acceleration but will probably catch up with your opponent fairly quickly. What you really have to remember is how good you are on the breaks and at handling your car.  There’s a lot of drifting in this game - well, the roads in the 20’ were not as good as they are now, and the tyres did not have as much grip as they have now.  The safety features around each track are limited to barriers, stacks of tyres, cones and crates. You can bump into the tyres and cones and consequently push them into the middle of the track. If, on your next lap, you run into them to fast, well . . . you will have an accident and probably lose several positions, too! Difficulty wise, first you can only play with your keyboard, which is challenging but fun. I found the first class quite hard, to be honest, but it seems to become easier as your progress within the game. Cranks and Goggles does have couple of glitches but they are not drastic and you will have fun with this game. Careers and quick race modes are available in this early access, and online mode will come later on.Fun cell shaded graphics and a great soundtrack add to the enjoyment.   In terms of the controls, you will be using the keyboard and it will take you a bit of time to get used to it. Positives:~~~~~~~  -	Fun graphics-	Career and quick race mode (soon online mode)-	Great soundtrack-	Great variety of carsNegatives:~~~~~~~~  -	No gamepad option-	No achievements and trading cardsI really like this game, from the gameplay to the music.

 TLDR: I like it, and you might very well too - as long as you know of beforehand or appreciate the challenge you're getting into. Let's start with some relevant questions. Do you remember classic 90s top-down keyboard racers - e.g. Micro Machines, Slicks and Slides and Generally? Good - This one is different, but it's a new classic right up there with them.Do you like European interwar racecars - you know -  open single seat, pinched cylinder, massive radiator grille, skinny tyres, open-wheeled vehicles driving round banked turns or rural tracks? Do the words Bentley Blower, Bugatti type 35, Alfa-Romeo Monoposto, Silver Arrows, Donington Park, Targa Florio, Brooklands etc. carry a loaded significance for you? Yes? The devs think so too. You're in the right place. It's all here in measure, disguised behind pseudonyms. Do you like the vintage interwar travel-poster aesthetic you see in the trailers and screenshots above (angular lowish-poly, untextured flat-shaded with light gradients)? Yes? Good. Here the presentation perfectly complements the racing-promo artwork from the era - and it still conveys all the information you need.Do you like Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grapelli gypsy-jazz music? Do you like post-ragtime novelty piano jazz? Yes? Because that's what the soundtrack sounds like (shame about the limited number of tracks, though). And most crucially - do you own an analogue input device (e.g. gamepad), and are you ready set aside some time an put some effort into learning to drive -  or to master this specific physics-heavy interpretation of the handling of these beasts?  Good, because - make no mistake - budget price and low-tech (yet lovely) aesthetics might make you mistake this for a casual arcade racer - which this is certainly not. Handling is the crucial factor in any driving game and the hardest to judge without playing yourself. As the devs put it on their webpage, they aimed for a 75% on the casual-to-sim scale - so, a Codemasters racer with most of the aids off?With that out of the way, some more initial impressions:What a debut for a new developer and a budget title! You really do get a surprisingly deep game for the price. Presentationwise, it's charming - it has personality in spades and it wears its appreciation of the underused era on its sleeve.  The unique look sets it apart from other games (probably also helps devs) and it's a perfect fit for the collective impression and memory of the theme and era. The music is as heard in the trailers - cheerful and catchy. The environments are often rural. It looks lovely despite it's simplistic style - and more importantly, the visuals are easily read, so you make out the physics of the suspension and traction. Its prettiest graphical trick occurs as the cars leave angular yet puffy dust clouds behind them - particularly when losing control or cornering, often obscuring part of the track and cars. The cars skitter across the undulating turns - sometimes unexpectedly under- or oversteering, while their engines buzz and hum in an updated more hi-fidelity version of warbling the Ad-Lib soundcard synthesized racers of yore. All the while a tinny travel-radio loops its (regrettably small) selection of cheery guitar/violin/piano jazz from the interwar era.Preference in  driving models  is subjective. I'm not an expert on interwar racers or cars in general. I'm not a true-blooded hardcore race-simmer. I've never raced and I've never driven a performance/race car or any car from earlier than the 1960s in real life. With that said,  the handling seems plausible enough. In any case, it's challenging, not very forgiving, and can feel a bit fiddly  (why did I spin out this time? - lack of focus or rushing?) - but it can be learned, appreciated, and probably mastered.  I still have much to learn, which in and of itself is a good feeling. Yet still, the very challenge may come as a rude awakening to many lured in by the excellent and summery presentation. So once again, take heed, it is most definately not a pick-up-and-play title - at least not for most.  Every lap is crucial and there is no time to dawdle as you only have three laps on minute-length laps. Initially, it is best to learn by following the AI. Three opponents compete for the grid and two lag behind. There are no foregone conclusions, as your AI competitors do make (plausible/human) mistakes.In the context of dedicated gamepad racers, yes, the Sega/Mario/Trackmania franchise racers have arcade reaction/reflex challenges - but they are far more forgiving in their driving models simply because, in general, you won't spin out for applying too much/little force or be struggling to simply in handling the car. Comparatively, difficultywise, in the dedication and dexterity required, we're up in NFS:Shift2/Dirt:Rally/etc slightly simmier gamepad-playable car game territory (with many assists turned off). The very fact that a six-euro game can be mentioned in the same breath as these multi-million [monetaryunit] productions is a credit to what the first-time developers have achieved.Prepare to lose, at least at first. Learn to appreciate the work put into the physics. Unless you're on a straight trajectory, don't hammer the accelerator or brakes.  Use the full analogue scale provided by your controller.  ABS and traction control don't exist and you're supposedly driving a rearwheel-drive 800kg 100-150 horsepower racer on four slick narrow motorbike wheels, often on a rural unpaved track. In general, any change of direction or speed should be well thought out beforehand and carried out with a feather-like touch (hence: discipline, using the full scale of the input and memorization of tracks help a lot).  Even without a damage model  the game punishes collisions,  be it with the track or other competitors. Offensive driving makes you lose control and hitting the track barriers often brings you to a stop. Stacked tyres spill and scatter across the raceway on impact - not only due to your actions but due to your competitor's actions too. As stated, handling is very important (both as a vehicle statistic and as a priority in control) but so is memorization.  The camera view  is pretty close, and even if it's top-down, it's at an angle. The camera does push and pull in a bit relative to your speed, but it always stays pretty close. Also, crucially, you will really often be braking well ahead of the turns and corners - which zooms you in. This and your screen's wide aspect ratio become deciding factors too. You see more of the track depending on driving orientation relative to the fixed orientation of the camera. The hardest turns are often the artificially blindest turns - those which approach the camera, southwards. Visibility east and west is alright and you can see further north downrange - driving away from the camera - but the tracks aren't on an isometric grid, you're often tackling twisting diagonal headings towards corners. The starting straight is often the only long easy straight on many tracks (though some do provide ""back straights"" or fast gently arched straight sections on the other sides). Maybe tweak the camera centering according to orientation?The online multiplayer is quiet and regrettably, as a former staple of the genre (many hands uncomfortably intertwined playing Twister as metagame in order to reach their corners of the same keyboard), there is no local multiplayer option (admittedly, the camera problems would be exacerbated, since it always follows the car - what about a more zoomed out view here too - and maybe implementing Traveller's Tales' excellent intelligent melding/separating/orienting splitscreen from the co-op in their lego games?).Do try this rare simmy-arcadey fishfowlbeast. And any improvements would be simply a few more tweaks (camera centering) and options (more laps? more AI drivers? local multi?).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I came for the shaded cells, stayed for the music!I always thought that late 20's/early 30's style art deco would fit nicely in a cell shaded game. But I ended up enjoying the music a lot more than I thought I would. I've always been a jazz fan, especially jazz from this [games] era. I'm in the main menu listening to it as I type this review!Now, although I am no expert on cars from this era, I do understand that most of them were rear-wheel drive. These cars feel like front-wheel drive; ex., I'm able to regain control from a slide by accelerating, and losing it when I decelerate. Is this something to do with these kind of cars, or am I forgetting how to drive a rear-wheel car?Beyond that and all the minor crashes expected of an early access title (of which there were few in my case), I enjoy this game, and look forward towards more races.

												Beautiful, charming, detailed, accriute game. Indeed it is all of those things and for just £1.99 in the sale you have little to no reason to not buy this game. The cars handle..  well.. as expected for 1920's race cars. Very difficult, but easy to pick up and you will soon find you are able to race as good as the Ai. The tracks are great and are really challenging but fun, even the Ai have difficulty on some of the tracks. The Ai also, thankfully, do not have that ""rubber banding""[as far as i can tell] that ruins alot of games! If you crash, you crash, you have to deal with it, their cars wont slow down and yours wont magically speed up. Equally if you are miles ahead, you are indeed miles ahead. A pleasent change to the generic racing games thrown out by big brand developers year after year. As far as i can tell from skimming through the negative comments, people were either expecting F1 car handeling, their computer from the stone age be able to run it or that they are actually lewis hamilton and its the cars fault they cant drive it. Im not sure which, but I know its certainly one of them. ",16,4,2,0,2,0,0

												A fantastic aesthetic top down racing game set in the era of Nuvolari, Varzi, Birkin and all those dudes (ie. the 20s and 30s).Skittery, ill handling machines (you WILL spin alot) which have to actually be *driven* through corners with more power than their hard rubber tyres can cope with.A pleasing variety of tracks (though it would be nice to see the odd 30s style banked oval as well as the gorgeous road courses) and some decent AI to play against mean this is a fun challenge which will provide alot of entertainment.Multiplayer should be ALOT of fun, but I haven't given it a go yet.If I had any criticisms/suggestions it would be to provide a little more field of view (though not much more, I love the way you have to actually learn the tracks), and the ability to set up custom championships/time trials with friends or against the AI.Oh and ghosts wouldn't hurt to learn to lap quickly and consistently.Excellent so far though, looking forward to see where it goes!

I can't recall how I first came across Crank and Goggles on Steam but it instantly caught my eyes and made my wishlist. With a more than fair price my cheap butt decided that I would buy it the first time I saw it on sale. I almost regretted it for one big glaring problem; The default controls borderline ruin the game. It was clunky, unenjoyable, and felt like I was back in time to the early 2000's playing finnicky Flash games in my browser getting carpal tunnel pecking away at arrow keys. But Crank and Goggles is so much more than that. There's a lot going on behind the scenes with these deceivingly simple little blocky cars. While you're presented with handling, acceleration, and speed stats for the vehicles there is definitely more to them than that. There's some actual physics involved here. These beasts seem to have weight. Braking in a straight line vs not? You'll experience a difference. They have two points of contact and can lose their backends quite easily like their real life inspirations. And while drifting inevitably happens, it isn't the fastest way around the track. There's a certain soft touch, a feather of the pedal, some romance, some nuance needed to guide these styled monsters around a track. All of which you simply cannot reasonably accomplish with the on/off of a keyboard stroke. Thank goodness for controller support! But upon plugging that in the default controls are buttons, more or less the same on/off lack of nuance. The saving grace was being able to finely just rebind the controls to the joystick and triggers. Axis's! Axes? Either way, pressure sensitivity!Once you can control your steering with subtlety and feather your pedals as the racing Gods intended this game opens up and becomes a challenging fun time. And the depth of the 'simple' game shines bright. I found myself doing things normally reserved for my racing wheel and a racing sim like 'sawing' my steering to save myself coming out of corners. Pumping brakes coming down hill. Utilizing corner apexes. Simply put I had a very good time racing. And it felt like racing. You'll get wheel to wheel with somewhat unpredictable AI that has a little bit of randomness to them. Its racing and its fun. It could use a few more tweaks or improvements. The AI gets a little slow towards the end game if you become competent in the corners. The hardest challenge is the time challenges, but that's more a matter of getting better vehicles. Bigger grids, longer races, more tracks, drafting, more music variety, etc would all be welcome but their absence doesn't detract. Also, don't expect to find a populated multiplayer lobby. And by populated I mean even a single soul. But some time trail leaderboards offer a glimpse of competition if you need more than the campaign. It took me roughly 10hrs to accomplish everything short of unlocking every car (you win in game credits winning racing and buy them up). So I got my money's worth in the price:playtime ratio for sure. The developers seem friendly and active. And the gameplay, sounds, simple tunes, and perfect visuals really deliver a complete package. Just remember to get your controller configured right! I would flat out say avoid without one. Recommended for sure though! Really something special.			",349,99,30,51,32,9,68

												This game is hard. Really hard. At the moment i'm 2 hours in, which is a LOT of 3 minute races. My average finish is 5th or last and i've fluked a 2nd and a 3rd out of probably 100 races so far. I have upgraded my car which has made it worse! Upgrades are a good idea, but perhaps you could specify what to upgrade (just handling would be my choice at the moment, adding speed later)The AI is good, they mess up occassionaly and don't slow down for you!At the moment, controlling the car is just too hard. Trying to get a feel for the car is impossible. It oversteers like a RWD if you let off the throttle before a slight change in direction, but understeers madly if you don't. This felt exciting and interesting when I first started - I couldnt wait for the learning curve to kick in and for things to improve, however it is so difficult to understand what is going on, and the margin for error so tiny, that the excitement gave way to frustration and is now bordering on apathy. (note: i'm a seasoned gamer and I love racing games, driving sims etc). I would understand if the starter car was underpowered but had fairly decent handling, but it doesnt. You nail the throttle to keep up, but have to guess the corner before you can see it in order to start a drift, which seems the only way to corner competitively. If you keep the trottle on you understeer into the wall. Let off while turning and you spin instantly. I feel like I have started the game in 'insane' mode, with all assists off.Perhaps its would be easier with a controller or even a steering wheel.Watch the launch video - those amazing turns are very very rare and feel a lot like luck! Most of the time I end up clipping a fence which spins me around and its race over.  If you make more than 1 mistake on the first lap you may as well restart straight away, there is no way you are going to finish 3rd once the other cars are not visible on the minimap. Which is another issue. You cant see where you are going, and you can't adjust the zoom even a tiny bit. You need to watch your fishtailing car so hard to keep it from spinning that you cant dare look too far ahead, and given the way the screen spins it is very difficult to get used to the subtle changes in direction of the car which give away how it is reacting to your driving, and that's how you would learn to tame these beastly machines.For those who would say 'its actually a great sim of how these old cars used to drive' ... terrible grip, crazy weight distribution, unforgiveable handling... perhaps. but they weren't driving while looking down on them from above, with only a second of track visible and the car turning constantly on the screen. I'm also not sure if they ever drove this fast on gravel or sand, which is what the surface feels like. Maybe a level of tracks comprised of only tarmac would make the start easier. Perhaps also with walls that didnt automatically spin you around if you hit them, like the fences and boxes do.FYI the first and last tracks seem a lot more forgiving than the middle tracks, I must have now played the second track 40 times in a row and I'm not getting any better!, i should be learning and improving.It is fun. And cheap at the moment, but it should be called 'impossible race' IMO. Please consider an easier start, a tutorial in case i'm missing something, and a slightly less severe starting difficulty somehow. Its hard to know whether to recommend this or not, at the moment i'd go for 'interesting and addictive but sabotaged by impossible learning curve and vicious starting difficulty'. I'm going to leave the game here but I will be back for every update in the hope that they tweak the handling in the direction of 'rewarding' rather than 'frustrating'.Pro: Looks great. Right up my street without being too 'crossy road' blocky.Pro: The rest of the package - levels look great fun, i like the idea of progressing through classes only when you win enough. A lot of love has gone into this so far.Pro: Is hard enough to be interesting and challenging...Pro: the odd occasiion you get a corner spot on is very satisfying but feels too much like luck.Con: ...but too hard to be rewarding at the moment.Con: Very hard to see what is actually going on with the car. I still cant work out if im driving a FWD or RWD car, it seems to have characteristics of both without the benefits of either.! Where is the weight? The physics need tweaking one way or another.I think this game will go in the right direction, so i'm going to recommend it, but it was close, i wont be playing for a while because i dont want to hate this game!

												First impressions - Micro Machines with 20-30''s theme. Your first car is ALMOST undrivable with a keyboard. With a controller, things get a bit easier, but not by much. Invest on Class C ASAP and start honing your skills on time trials! For this price (4,19€), it's worth to check it out.Recommended for petrol heads and those familiar with 90's top down racing games			",112,7,17,6,16,1,12

												Apart from the PC/Dreamcast title Spirit of Speed 1937, the 1920s and 1930s don't get much of a look-in when it comes to driving games, which is a massive shame because pre-war Grand Prix racing set the foundations for the way racing continued up to the end of the 1950s and paved the way for the advent of Formula 1.Cranks & Goggles is a really promising game, where the cars have decidedly different handling characteristics and the whole thing could be termed ""easy to learn, hard to master"". Please check out the full review below but I'd highly recommend giving this a go and look forward to the updated down the line.

												I can really recommend this game. This game is absolutely FANTASTIC, really you gonna LOVE it. It's different than other racing games and really fun to play.This game has cons but a lot of pros. Pros:- It's really fun to play- There are a lot of cars each with their own handling and feeling- The handling feels realistic- There is a wide variety of tracks in different styles (Snowy, Tarmac and Sandy)- Music is typical music of the 20's- As far as I know, there is one real car brand, maby not well know but it's real (MG)- It's challenging (driving is not as easy as you think but you can learn it)Cons:- You can't sustain damage- There isn't an option to play this in first person which makes it often rather hard to find a breaking point before a corner (Would be nice if the devs created this option however it's NOT a must)- A.I is not perfect- There may be a couple of bug, however I haven't found one yet- You always have to start at the back of the fieldMy conclusion is a solate 9/10. Yes the game may not be perfect at this stage but it has just released and I think the devs are really busy making this a better game.This game is gonna be GREAT. Really, it's gonna be GREAT!

												at first i was a little disapointed, the 2d graphics were underwhelming and i had some difficulty controlling the car. i stuck with it though, and the game has grown on me. there is room for improvement, like the engine sounds during the game are weak, more noticeable because they tease you with the growl of a legit 20's race car engine in the game setup page. it's too bad that the game cars don't sound like real cars. i like the artsy feel of the game, and once i got a setup on my gamepad that i liked the cars became easier to control. i'm in about 9 hours so far, and i'm only on B level cars still, so the game is pretty challenging- especially at first. the game crashes once in a while, usually after playing for an hour or so. it's not a big deal since the autosave works well, but something that needs to be addressed. multiplayer races would be fun, but i never see anyone on.

												First, the art style is very clean and effective.  Game could not be more charming.  Second, the cars are really hard to drive.  It is satisfying every time you make a clean corner or chicane.  Most driving games have a built in cheat, where if you spin out, you can catch up to pack in a few seconds.  Not here.  You need to have 2-4 minutes of focus to get  on the podium.  I do not play many driving games anymore because I don't like 'chase cam' racers.  This game gets it right for me because the length of race and tension feels about right.  I have seen criticism about not seeing enow road ahead, but that is somewhat mitigated by having shorter tracks you can learn in a few tries.  Also most corners have plenty of visual cues you can use to judge your timing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												this game caught my eye and i liked how it looked. playing it however is frustrating at first as the cars have no grip at all and you need to learn to point, brake, turn then accelerate or you fly off the track and everyone passes you.the car upgrades you buy dont really help much except for top speed and getting on the line quicker so you need to take plenty of laps around the tracks to get use to what your car can do.many tracks, different levels of enemies (other racers) to ram, crash into and try to beat.you need to race clean though because the a.i. is very fast up front and rarely makes mistakes.I can see this being a highly competitive online game with leagues soon developing from it.have found a couple of bug like the overhead camera zooms right in on your car in the last track on the top level so you crash as you just cannot see what your doing, it does this in 4 places around the map and puts the driver right off.the 1920's music and sound effects as you race around the track add to the fun aspect of the game which doesnt try to take itself to seriously.this isnt need for speed or the best graphics package but it isnt supposed to be either.but apart from that this is a really fun but hard little racing game you'll enjoy trying to beat.for the price, highly recommended.

												I love the old school styling and the simple and clear graphics, but the game play is not fun. Basically, it's too difficult and unfortunately not in a fun way. It's made difficult by the poorly utilised perspective that constantly changes and leaves you without sufficient visibility to reliably pick a line or avoid obstacles and other cars. If your car is heading from the bottom left to the top right, you can see far up the track. However if you are going from the top left to the bottom right you can only see about 10 car lengths ahead. As a single mistake will cost you the race, it becomes a boring chore of repeating the same track until you learn what's coming up in the parts you can't see.  If the camera angles are changed so you can see far enough to drive, I'd try to master this. But at the moment it's simply frustrating and I can't give it my recommendation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Great racing game! The car is more harder to keep on track than in other top-down racers like this, C&G actually tries to simulate those vintage cars (which are so cool), and you will spin out alot in the beginning, before you learn to control your speed and adjust your turning. When you get the hang of it, driving feels good, you get satisfaction from each succesful corner you take, and the driving has more depth than your ""basic"" top-down racer would have. LITTLE TIP: The first races are the toughest (slow cars with pretty poor handling), so just hang in there until you unlock better cars then the game becomes a little bit easier and more fun. After you get a little better those D-class races are more fun.What I like probably most in this game, is that cars have good variation to them in terms of handling, speed, engine sound, center of mass, grip, drifting. Every car feels different when you drive them, and learning to drive is very rewarding. It's nice to keep collecting the cars and trying them out. Music is nice oldies type of thing. There is a career mode in which you finish races to get reward money and buy new cars, and then there is time trial mode in which you try to beat a given time for reward (there are also 3 reward cars for doing well) and it has also leaderboards.A small con is that I feel there is a few inconsistancies in the tracks, meaning that there might be some elevation in the track that you can't see and it causes you to spin out if you turn too much in that spot, but this is still early access game and the dev knows this issue so I am counting this will get fixed.I have played 8 hours by now and almost completed the single player component but not yet fully, and there is online multiplayer around the corner. Great devs that post actively at the forums!			",160,16,9,11,7,2,1

								Get ready to drift, but not for drift racing this time!Playing this game evoked a thrill and sensation of playing 90's hit titles like Super Cars II or Death Rally, but without guns and ammo.I have to confess, I've only invested 14 hours of gameplay and have only made it to Class B thus far.  It's a lot harder than it looks and a bit of a time commitment (as many people have commented), but I think that's what makes the game charming.  Most importantly, it's not so hard that it's no longer fun.I actually had to rewrite this post after the August update.  Before the update, I was finding myself hitting the reset car key quite a bit.  After the update, cars seem to have a better grip and are easier to handle.  That said, there is no reset car key anymore! If you can avoid hugging the wooden fences, you're sorted.After all, it's about having fun, not about winning or losing, right?Above all, 
driver customization is a soft touch, the soundtrack is catchy drawing listener into the era,  in-game color palettes with nice cell shaded graphics resemble the vintage racing posters, plus, it gets more fun when you master your controls, preferably with an analog controller.There are still some glitches and visuals/sounds are limited, but Crank & Goggles still worth its price tag. Also, developers seem to be responsive and quick at updating the game.For the future releases, I'm looking forward to opening drive mode, more races, and a storyline about rivals, world news, car makers etc.			",9,6,1,0,1,0,0

								A lovely 20s art style with cell shaded cars and  music from the era all  help to give this game a lot of character. The racing is fun, though the cars do seem overly twitchy at times, often for no obvious reason -iIt feels a little random at times. You will be hitting the reset car key a lot as you progress through the classes but the game is addictive enough to keep you coming back. The wheel to wheel racing is great, with the top down view lending itself well to picking the fastest line through corners.Oh and don't worry about there being no pad support, joytokey works really well. It's shareware and so obviously do teh right thing if you use the tool.Overall this game is really promising. Visually it's great and the controls feel right. Handling just needs a little tweaking.

								Lots of nice things about the game. The visuals for starters, and then the racing system. If you want to accelerate throughout, you'll be in deep trouble.Lots of work to be finished though. Here are some things.1. Car veers off forever sometimes, when driver loses control (I'm sure the devs are working on it)2. There is limited engine/braking/skidding sounds right now. Music is fine but not sure it's needed during races. Driving sounds should be enough...3. There is a nice gameplay learning curve, but it's very short. Once you win the first cup, you can basically win all races until the end. Some better rivals would help significantly.4. Couldn't help think that giving a bit more ambiance would go a long way. For example, where's the newspaper talking about the race results? Also, where' my archirival? The racers are more or less anonymous throughout.4a. Tiny point: all racer's names are in the form of ""I. Nitial"", but as players we cannot add the same structure to our name.5. Finally, the fact that there are no people watching the race makes it seem relatively empty overall.In short, lots of promise, but too easy (for now) and the ambiance produced by the graphics could be complemented with a few storytelling aspects. Glad I bought it! ",3,0,1,0,2,0,0
