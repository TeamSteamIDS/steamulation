Looks good but need more development. Considering it's still in early access it may be a simple alternative for Wipeout series in the future.

								Very cool game. You can choose between 4 gliders.Goal is it to reach a particular speed and avoid barricads to get to the boss an beat him.The game is still at the start so there is in the moment only 1 track but more will come.For me the game has very good potential. I'm excited how it will proceed.			",95,21,6,22,13,0,8

								This game is super laggy, and I can't turn down the graphics because there are not settings at all, do not purchese this game if you don't have a super pc, (gaming pc).			",75,12,2,10,24,0,5
