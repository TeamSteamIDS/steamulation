Early Access Review
								In my years ive spent time working on cars. I know enough about them to pretty much know how to put one together so i figured this wouldnt be too bad. Part 1: What a peice of junk. There strewn about me was dozens of engine parts all along the shelfing. I recognize many of them and i think to myself hey, this wont be too bad. 2 hours go by. Part 2: Fear and loathing in finland.I knew nothing. All of the stress. All of the hair pulling frustration and gut wrenching heartake of wasted time is encapsulated perfectly by this game. That point in your project where youre so keyed up you have to just walk away and go to town for a drink at the pub. Its all there. Its the most realistic simulation of a project car that ive ever seen.Part 3: My moment of glory.After 7 hours of toiling. Putting the engine together. Finding a part i missed. Taking it back apart. All of the constant pain and suffering. I finnally lower the engine and transmission into the car body. I find all the linkages and hoses and connect everything. I put in oil. I put in coolant. I put in what little gasoline i have. Not time to hook up the driveshafts yet. i must test the engine. I jump into my bare body car. Id only bothered to put in the basics things. The seat. The shifter. The steering wheel. Id assembled the wheels and such of course. The only missing basic necessity was the driveshafts and probably the exaust pipe. Wasent needed for a test run though. I lean to the right. I hit the ignition. It turns. Turns. Turns. IT HAS STARTED. THE ENGINE HAS STARTED. It sounds horrible. Its missing. Its stuttering. But it RUNS!!!Part 4 Why does this always happen to me. I hear what can... only be described as a slight cluck. The engine stalled. I suppose it had run out of fuel. I look and it had. I try to put some more in and do so. I get back in to start it up. Tickticktick. Its not turning over. I get out and look at it. Then down in the pit over which id parked i notice something. a small part...The starter had fallen out.I recommend my summer car to anyone that has ever worked on a car before. Also to anyone who thinks they know everything about how cars work. Is it 100% full on accurte in every respect? No. I dont think any game can be. But its the closest thing to actually working on a car that ive ever encountered. I now have to pull the engine back out of the car and try to get the starter back on while figuring out what went wrong in the first place. Some projects never end.Oh yeah theres like a survival thing too but i mean. All you have to do is not die like in real life. Some people might find that harder than others. PS: To the creator of this game. If you could somehow make this game or a similar concept in multiplayer i will give you my soul.			",64,5,6,15,26,0,3

You realize you're here on this world for a reason.  That car project is a turd.  You realize it's not your fault.  Turds happen in life.  It's your job to take the turd out of life.  Pump the turds out of the car like you pumped the turds out of those septic tanks you say to yourself.  Yes.

Your hairs stand up all over your body.  This pile of turd is holding together.  You drive back home with color in your life again.  The bright sun.  The green grass.  A faint smile on your face as you pull into the garage.64. put the gear into neutral.  shut the car off.  pull the parking brake.  sitting there in the garage simmering in your glory.  you did it.65. get out of the car and look at it.  wavy rust covered body panels and all.  she's beautiful because I made her.66. put the last of the body parts on.  the floors and shelves are empty of parts.  it's sunday morning and you have to show her to the world.67. pull up to the shop for the first time with her.  you put the gear in neutral.  turn her off.  engage parking brake.  walk out.  infront of her.  stepping back.68. emotion starts hitting you hard as you stand there.  you realize this story has unfolded much like your real life project car.69. drive back home with a big smile now.70. order half the catalog of aftermarket parts.71. phone rings and you hear the resentment in Teimo's voice as he tells me my parts have arrived.72. rip through the dirt roads with a sudden realization that I have played soo many games in my time but I NEVER have been this excited about VIRTUAL goods.  I was genuinely excited af.73. the excitment only grows as the postage bill is paid and I see the boxes waiting for me.74. genuine excitement to open the boxes fills me as I head back home75. completly forget about eating, drinking and cleaning as the packages were being opened and parts being installedThis game has surprised me at every turn.  The attention to little details is asstounding.  Two things that really hit me hard.1. the feeling of finishing your project car.  it felt genuine.  you go through the same struggles with a car build in real life.  The game somehow captured the emotions when you complete a car.  It's something you build with your own two hands.  Most people playing this game might not understand this but feeling those emotions again gives me some modivation to go finish my car that i'm building for the 2nd time.2. genuine feelings of excitment when you get new parts for your car.  the whole experience of ordering, waiting, picking them up and installing them is genius.  I never expected soo many emotions from this game.			",121,7,26,6,22,2,9

								Simply put, one of the hardest, most frustrating, most obnoxious games I have ever played.There are no tutorials.Nothing is in English.You know nothing.Suddenly you're dead and broke and your car has exploded.You scream ""F$@# this game"" at the top of your lungs.And then suddenly you figure out how to put your first part together and you scream and cry and laugh in joy.Hours take place and you finally found that missing screw you forgot to tighten, you learn to tune your car and get it to start. It finally stops stalling on you, the engine hasn't blown up yet and you start to drive to your inspection to find out whats wrong with it still only to find out that the only thing that IS wrong, is that you forgot a stupid triangle in your trunk.But its okay, because now its time for an adventure.This game seriously, gives you some of the hardest rage moments in a single player game. But you keep going back for more because its all on you! You have to figure it out and by the devils angel is it hard to do! But once you do, it is the most rewarding and satisfying feeling that I have ever experienced in a game like this EVER. Because no one is holding your hand, no one is helping you cheat your way to victory, it's all you.So go you, and make this happen, make your dreams come true as you build your little $h!^^y car that you almost want to drive off a cliff. But you wont, and in the end, you'll love this game, no matter how many times you rage quit after smashing your keyboard.10/10Can't wait for the future updates!			",170,47,4,36,59,0,21
