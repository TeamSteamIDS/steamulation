Early Access Review
 Led it Rain DISCLAIMER: I received this product for no cost for the purpose of reviewing. However, this does not affect my views and opinions of the game.This game is pretty extreme. The best way I can describe it is; a 3D-First-Person-Biker-Racing-Demon-Shooter. You race around a track on a hog or motorbike of some-sort, shooting up zombies and other demonic looking creatures while picking up power-ups and women in bikinis, as you listen to some metal music. -------- Graphics: 6 / 10   Graphic style and art is very subjective. Although I feel like the art-style of the game was too ""grungy"" or ""rugged"" for my tastes, it really did set the tone of the game and contributed to the overall theme. All the stages of the game  have this very broken down, old rustic feel too it. This doesn't mean all the stages look the same, there's 6 stages in the game (though I'm not sure if more are unlocked or will be added later) and all have very unique and interesting settings. The quality of the visuals aren't bad considering it's a small indie title that was on a tight budget. The visuals do get the job done. The game runs fine on mid-tier graphics cards and CPUs, though I feel some of the lower tier cards may not be able to handle the game as well. I did have a slight problem with the game's loading speed, though it's a minor gripe.  -------- Sound: 6 / 10  Again, this is very subjective. I'm not someone who really enjoy metal music that much but this game is chalk full of it. Though to be fair, it does play with the theme of the game and really fits as you mow down zombies and gun down enemies like a bad♥♥♥♥♥ There was a noise that repeated every so often that bothered me, I believe it was a noise that one of the enemies made. It was a little bit annoying though because it didn't happen THAT often, it's a very minor complaint. The gun shot noises sound fine, as well as the sound of your motorcycle speeding up and even hitting other objects/enemies. -------- Mechanic: 5 / 10 Essentially you drive down the path shown to you with your standard ""WASD"" controls. While you're driving, you can use the mouse to aim and shoot at enemies or objects. The controls are a little bit weird at first, and may take some getting used too. You have a certain amount of laps you go through on each stage. You can pick up power ups like a Machine Gun or Sharks, which help you kill enemies a lot faster. You could also simply run over enemies. There are women in bikinis standing around in certain places, and when you run into them, you receive a  kiss which restores 1 hit-point/life to you. You lose hit-points/lives by taking damage within the game, and once you've lost 3, you're done. At the end of each play through, you're awarded a score which you can send to the leader-boards, as well as some cash that you can use in the shop on the main menu to purchase a variety of things, most of which are cosmetic. I don't really know how the game determines how much cash you're rewarded with, but it is a good amount.-------- Final Personal Remarks I don't really understand why the game seems like a race, and even counts your laps, when you're not really racing anyone. Though I guess you could try for better times, and see how fast you can complete each stage while simultaneously trying to kill the most enemies. I found driving the hog to be somewhat difficult, especially when trying to shoot things at the same time, though I've heard that using a controller is much easier. I also didn't really feel like I was taking much damage from the enemies at all, I mostly died to explosions I caused on my own, or things that I could have controlled. Despite all of that, the game is actually kind of interesting, and it is competent. I still don't know if the game is intended to be serious, or just a funny novelty sort of thing, but I could see how people would enjoy it, or find it random or funny. There are people that enjoy extreme things like this, although it's not something I that I personally do, but it doesn't make it a bad title.  Thanks to the devs for giving me the opportunity to review the game, as well as anyone who took this review into consideration, I hope it helped.			"

								Oh boy... This game went and pulled me in Hook, line and Sinker. Bikers? Chicks? guns? Zombies? Metal soundtrack?Everything sounded absolutely fantastic. Full review:


YouTube™ Video: Led it Rain - Early Axe

			Led it Rain zombie-shooting motercycle racing game set to a solid metal and rock soundtrack, developed by Ataverti. This is uploaded at 1440p (upscaled from 1080p) for best visual fidelity.		

Summary:Sure, it's early access and i expected limited gameplay scope and missing features or major bugs, but what i didn't expect was that the game took every one of those items i mentioned, and butchered them.The bike controls like absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥and as the track doesn't actually appear to have borders (but does have invisible walls) you will smack, smash and slide like you're on ice strapped to a brick. it doesn't feel like a bike at all.The revolver you use has infinite ammo, and while i can live with that... there are no other weapons or load-outs.the two pickups leave you no control over them. the ""shark"" doesn't even appear to do anything.The zombie AI, basic as it is... STILL manages to break. Lets not even begin with collision detection, animation and sound assets... even when there at all, they look beyond basic and sub par.I would like to like this game, i'd like to say it has potential and early access will be a boom. But right now it would need to be redone from scratch in every single regard to be passable, let alone good.Oh, and the total content in the game can be experienced in a grand total of 20 minutes. Yeah.			"

								This is everything I've ever wanted in a motorcycle racing DOOM-style zombie shooter.Seriously, this game is so fun. You ride on a motorcycle through horror themed levels with zombies trying to stop your progression. In order to avoid dying (you take 3 hits before you die, unless you get a kiss from a bikini lady, that restores one health) you must shoot down the ones directly in your path, or get a powerup to mow them down.All in all, the controls may take a minute to get used to (I used a 360 controller and was fine) but it's very fun!
