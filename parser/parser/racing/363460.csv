												First off, the developer is freaking awesome! The humor of this game caught my attention right away, and at 3 bucks, I thought ""why not?"". I began playing and had a problem right from the start. Nothing wrong with the game, but rather my preferences. I play most FPS/flying games with an inverted mouse. The option was not available in the options menu in the game. So I did like I do with most games that have this same issue. I posted in the forums to see if there was a way to invert my mouse so I don't crash into things like a drunk spermy driver. Within hours the dev replied to my post and only a short time after replying, UPDATED THE ENTIRE GAME just to add an invert mouse option! I've never even seen anything like this before. So, in my opinion, this game is worth buying - and any other game this dev puts out in the future. Also, I love this game lol! Such a simple and unique idea (a common factor in many hit games) and so much fun with lasers, torpedoes and fierce battles with 1000 spermies at a time. 10/10 Replay value: Would ejaculate again and again and again and again etc.			"

												I spent some time (when I say time I mean two playthroughs) when I figured this game out.  It's a game that you have to level your ""sperm"" up to be better than the rest, then you win and impregnate the ovary.  This game is 3 bucks, and it is what it is.Here's a video we made for it, and this is literally the game:

If you're having trouble running the game (like I did), the devs are great and will work with you to get the game up and running....It's so worth it! I have to said it, devs...Those little 'Bundle OJf Joy's are truly Butt-♥♥♥ Ugly, lol! Anyway, the price certainly is fair enough for one of the funnest games out there. I laughed so hard, I thought I'd have a laundry problem!Devs, thank-you for giving us a game that's totally out of the box and off the wall. Hope to see more adventurous games like this in the future.			"

												In a tale as old as time itself, you will find yourself battling to not just live, but to create life itself. Honestly, this game is certainly unique and quite hilarious. The game's simple controls and simple objective make this something easy to play to pass the time. The extreme low-poly graphics leave something to be desired, but I also think that's part of what makes this game intriguing. I'm not sure I could play this in high-def. As far as gameplay goes, I did come across some issues if I crashed into a wall. I seemed to get caught in a repeated animation loop for a few seconds, and the game seems a little jumpy at times. I did find it a little hard to direct my sperm around to collect the money and speed boosts. Overall, this isn't a game to be taken seriously, which should be pretty clear from the content.; however it's still fun and if you are just looking for a laugh, I'd recommend it.			"

+ Insane concept, you are racing through a uterus with 1000 other sperm cells who are all trying to kill one another while trying to get to an egg to conceive a baby. + The gameplay is actually a lot of fun. At the start your load is shot out all at once and your screen is covered with other sperm cells and lasers shootng every which way. You can shoot at the other cells with your weapons, pickup speed power ups, and try to get to the end before any other. If you are not first or if you die you lose.+ A variety of weapons and upgrades to unlock + Sometimes you get digested in the Stomach, meaning the girl took it down her throat, and if you reach the stomach first you unlock an Uber weapon.+ Good soundtrack- Short / Low Replayability. Without a guide I was able to quickly figure out what to do and beat the game multiple times within about 10-15minutes			"

												Well now to be honest I always wanted to know what it was like to be a sperm, and well Spermination gave me that in site and boy was I blown away. The journey is a tough one indeed, I had billions of the little tackers to pass and boy are they fitter than poor little me, maybe I need more Iron so I can over take them all o-OAnyway I'm down voting this game, because the control I had was not great, my spermie moved rather slow even with the speed power up, maybe he / she was a reject  and this happens I guess o-OAlso it does not play great with the Xbox controller and this feature could be added and or improved. I mostly used the mouse and WASD mostly W to move forward and mouse to fire and move in circles and side ways. I don't know maybe I'm doing it all wrong, I have no Idea. But I do Know is my mouse hand got very sore, so I had to take a break from playing the game o-OAlso you cant buy very many different firing guns, Armour and speed options. I feel there could be more and better weapons and Armour with the $'s you collect along your journey. As every play through you have to buy the items which is called prepare your load, well I prepared alright, but the best I got to the egg was 12 and so I threw in the towel as my hand got very sore after many try's.Also if you do choose to get this game be warned, it crashed for me at the start. You must update java or you cant play the game, see forums for help with this issue, if unsure.Price wise ! Well maybe wait for a very good sale as to me this game does not offer very much and you can get rather board very quickly playing it constantly.Sadly I never made a baby, maybe I can try again another time. Perhaps the developers will improve the game and maybe add achievements and improve the performance of the game, so we have a much better success rate o-O			"

Dont try to put to much thought into this game - your a sperm cell, and you got one job! to kill your fellow sperm-sibling and become the chosen one hehehe.  The controls are very simple; and all the little add-ons you can put are neat. Many cool ways to blast and destroy anyone who stands in your way to become THE ONE.  The end game is funny as well.

												Totally inane, and there isn't much variety as far as strategy goes. The only weapon worth using requires a won run, and the only way to win is to use the fastest engine and afterburner. Turrets on the walls are relentless, and there's no way to dodge their shots. Graphics are very simple, no textures anywhere.EDIT with more detail:I don't think the graphics are bad, but they are very plain, and may not appeal to some people.You can kill the turrets, but there are so many of them that if I took the time to kill them, i fell way behind the pack and have no chance of winning. I didn't like the invisibilty power up, since it precludes the afterburner, which is much more helpful.I did try the armor powerups a few times, but they make you so heavy, it is very hard to change momentum and snag the power-ups that are needed to succeed. I found i made it to the end more often when I went with no armor and focused on speed.Uber cannon is tons of fun to use, but it makes the other weapons feel very weak by comparison, so i usually just stuck with the basic lasers.

Spermination is an on-rails shooter reminiscent of StarFox, that has you play as a sperm cell trying to reach the egg at the end of an oddly-shaped uterus to become a fetus.The gameplay is simple. Too simple, in fact. There are shooting mechanics in place that, in theory, help you take out rival sperm cells in your race towards making new life, but in practice they end up being useless because of the sheer amount of enemies present. The upgradable weapons end up being a waste seeing how it's impossible to actually defeat all of the 1000 tiny dots you're meant to shoot if you want to be the last remaining candidate for fecundation. All of this means that you're going to spend your time flying forward with some really, really clunky flying controls to be victorious. Apart from the boring and pointless gameplay, the only saving grace for the game, its humor, gets old really fast after you chuckle at the jokes thrown at you for coming first, going the wrong way, or being a helpless victim of oral sex. You're looking to approximately 10 minutes of ""gameplay"" to see everything there is to see jokeswise, because the actual races are something you're certainly not going to want to repeat. Overall, the 3 funny things you end up seeing are not worth the (cheap) price of admission, and earns this game a Non Recommended review from me.Note: the game was NOT gifted to me by the developers, but by my friend (mostly as a joke)			"

												Spermination is a First Person Racing game that feels very similar to Space Sim genre as you can add lasers, ion cannons and thrusters to your sperm. You start off with a rather weak laser, no armor and a sub-par engine but by collecting floating money icons as you race through either the mouth or ♥♥♥♥♥♥, you will be able to upgrade your sperm for the next race. Be warned though, those additions to your sperm will only last a single race and you will start with nothing the next race regardless if you win or lose, so it may be best not to overspend on a single race. For each race won you will either create a monstrous looking baby or simply be swallowed. You don't really get anything for winning other than raising your percentage of successful emissions that will eventually unlock some more upgrades to equip. Each race generates a entirely new map featuring different layouts, different turret placement and strangely enough different ♥♥♥♥♥♥l wall colors like blue, green and orange, making you wonder what this dude is having sex with.Unfortunately even though the maps are different each time, they feel very much the same and don't really feel like they were made with racing in mind due to most of the map just being a straight wide line. It makes sense I suppose, but realism is not really a thing in this game and random turret placement does not help to differentiate one race from another. There are power ups in this game, including health pick ups to repair your sperm and an energy overcharge which allows you to shoot or use your abilities indefinitely for a short amount of time. They are randomly generated throughout the course and are far too numerous. The courses are far too littered with power-ups making it so you can keep getting the overcharge power up every few seconds and simply breezing through the game. One other annoyance is that you can not crash in this game.  If you plunge into a wall you will either go through it or be instantly teleported to the location before you crashed. Feels like a missed opportunity for some tense racing moments, like when the walls narrow and changes direction it makes it so all the racers are in tight quarters, so it would be pretty awesome to see some of them crash while trying to avoid one anothers weapon fire.Thankfully you don't have to be holding down the forward key all throughout the race, as you can let it go whenever you want and the sperm continues moving forward, allowing you to focus on shooting at any direction. Imagine if the classic title “Asteroids” was in first person and you should have a spot on mental image of this feature. The race begins with one thousand sperm cells but that number will quickly dwindle as they are quite aggressive and will start blasting each other immediately. It is a pretty impressive sight seeing one thousand sperm sells flying all over the place, shooting at one another but their numbers are far too great to make it viable to win via shooting them down so it may be best to simply focus on those shooting you and be on your way. You can equip your sperm with heavier armor to take more damage but that in turn will make you slower so it may not be worth it for those that prefer speed. There is only one lap so you can't simply kill enemies and wait to pounce on those in the lead when they overlap you. This is primarily a racing game so don't expect something like Carmageddon.Spermination does feature rubber-banding AI. They are quite found of suddenly zooming past you when you are a few meters from the egg. Turrets are also far more likely to immediately target you and ignore the competition. This is counteracted by them not being able to use power-ups, so you do have an advantage over them. Turrets become a much graver threat the deeper in you go and it adds some strategy as you may find being in first place will make you more likely to be killed. A nice little touch is that enemies all have different weapons equipped making combat feel a lot more satisfying as you will obviously want to deal with the shotgun like “spread shot” differently than the last sperm that had a puny laser. On the other hand no matter what weapon you have, your enemies will die in one hit, making your weapons feel a lot less diverse. There are one thousand racers you have to contend with but having a few actually use the equip-able armor would be a good solution. All your money comes from power-ups and you do not gain anything from winning other than unlocking a few more additions to buy for your sperm after a unspecified amount of wins. So winning gets you more items, items are purchased by money gathered around the stage and items are lost after each race. It is a endless cycle that gets old fast.In case any one was wondering it does not have any nudity, you just hear a grunt and away you go into the randomly selected orifice. Visually it is no looker but it serves it's purpose, all though all text in the game is covered with ugly blue splotches after an update. Music consists of this weird techno music which fits in rather well surprisingly enough. There is only one song for the main menu and one for the actual gameplay so it does get a bit worn out eventually. Other than playing the game the only other thing there is to do is to look through a collection of all your hideous babies for your viewing pleasure. If this was some kind of plot to convince people to use protection, it most certainly is a good way to educate them on the very real dangers of going in unprepared. And by that I mean you'll need lasers to scavenge that wasteland of all it's cash pickups and come out rich, or die trying. As you can no doubt tell, Spermination has a very odd concept for a game and it does offer some rather fun gameplay but has very little lasting appeal. It is sold for a rather small price and I do feel it offers enough novelty and fun to recommend to those looking for a short game with enough weirdness as to make your friends question your sanity.

												This game is a visual masterpiece. It redefines not only it's genre, but gaming as a whole. It is an action-RPG-dungeoncrawler-romance-educational eroge with a twist of drama. The main protagonist **SPOILERS** commits hundreds of thousands of counts of fratricide in the name of his (or her!) true love.As a male, this brings home the reality of the tiny soldiers down south who fight against the equivalent of the landing at Normandy (i.e., your partner's uterus, which has many AA batteries dedicated to bringing your troops down) and has taught me a valuable lesson: women are scary and should be avoided at all costs.If you're a female, this teaches you that you are a monster who assists in countless instances of homicide. For shame. However, this hope: always remember that, regardless of being male or female, you blew up as many siblings as you could and engaged your seminal speed-demon engines to make it to the endzone first.11/10, would ejaculate again.

												This game offers a lot of fun for its price (Especially since I got it for £1).  It lacks in replayability once all the achievements are acquired as there isn't much to do other than race sperm through a bullet hell.Would love to see a multiplayer version of this game but even if it were to happen I doubt you'd find 999 other players to be a sperm with, and over half would die instantly...Great game.

												I feel as though I am constantly sucked into the world of Spermination. It's low poly visuals just suck me in coming for more (See what I did there XDDDDD) You race other sperm trying to be the first one to fertalize the egg whilst also buying upgrades making your sperm faster, stronger, and unlocking more weapons to defend yourself from other sperm and these turret like things in the walls of the delicate uterus. All in all, I say Spermination is well worth the price and is a great time waster.			"

												Full Disclosure: My copy of the game was provided to help test bugs on the mac version. For a guide of how to run this game on mac on the latest patch (as of Jan 13, 2016), go to the bottom of the review.I really like this game. It has solid gameplay with clear goals in mind. There is virtually no story (besides the process of making babies), but one would not be necessary. The ""babies"" you collect are a nice touch, as whenever I win I am curious as to what my next baby will look like.The one negative I have for this game is the difficulty. On my first run, I made it halfway. On my second, I made it to the end but was not first. At around my sixth run, I made it to the end, first. Next run, I won again. Then, again. You tend to steamroll the game fairly quickly once you realize that the way to win is  save up enough money for the afterburner and the fastest engine and never buy weapons. Then just try to get to as many energy powerups and boosts as possible. Only use your energy for the afterburner . I don't know if I would advocate that the difficulty be raised, but it is definitely an issue.Lastly, let me say that the developer, phr00t, is absolutely amazing. He was there, constantly, when I was having problems with another of his games, 4089, and, to help him test for bugs in both 4089 and Spermination, he gave me a copy. He is always ready to listen to bugs and responds to reports on the forums very quickly. An amazing dev.All in all, I really like this game, and I would advocate buying it whether on sale or not.How to run on Mac:1. Open a finder window and go to Macintosh HD/users/(username)/Library/Application Support/Steam/Steamapps/common/Spermination.2. Right-click or control-click on Spermination.app. Then press show package contents.3. Go to contents/Resources/Java.4. Double click on Spermination.jar.Ta-Dah!If you are having trouble locating your library, try this:1. Open a new terminal window.2. Type ls and then press enter.3. Type open Library and then press enter.4. Save this folder to your sidebar by dragging the icon at the top-center of the window to your sidebar. It should stay there, and you can now access your Library folder easily.			"

												PREPARE YOUR LOAD! ... >_>;Yeah, get used to hearing that when playing this game. x)  I could easily see this as a Family Guy game as it really reminds me of the episode when Stewie shrinks his sperm ship and goes inside Peter blowing up other sperm ships (and mini babies? o.o).  Although, in this case I guess it'd be him inside Lois trying to get out to take over the world? ;oThat being said, at it's core it's a simple race to the finish game while blowing up your competitors...while at the same time running through a gauntlet.  There are various floating things to pick up that give you more money, regain health or energy, or act as a speed boost.  A number of different ship options to buy (that are only for that...er...race), but I didn't really use many of them.  The controls feel more like a space flight sim than anything else as you only have an accelerator and change course based on where the mouse is pointing - you have to account for a sluggish momentum to get you to turn or change course.  It takes a bit to get used to...The, um, offspring that are made are...out there though.  *shudders*That being said, this game amused me WAAAAY more than I thought it would for the silly theme that it has.

												This ""game"" is a one-off joke that gets old really quickly. The whole concept of the game relies on a ""Ha ha ha! I'm a sperm! Prepare your load! LMAO"" mentality whereas the actual GAME part of the game is abhorrent garbage. The controls are god-awful (only having a forward key and mouse rotation with the floatiest steering I've seen in a while), the gun-play is utterly useless in trying to gun down other sperms as all guns are horribly inaccurate and slow moving, and the only mechanic that could have been interesting (purchasing upgrades) is rendered entirely null as you are reset back to zero every single time you end a race. This makes the optimal strategy to play a few times spending no money and making no effort to win while collecting as much money as possible to buy the best upgrades for a single successful run. Even for 3 dollars, I consider this game overpriced. Though a bit older, Wizorb is $3 and has a bunch of content, well programmed mechanics and is fun.  Super Crate Box is FREE and has more content and good design than this arduous Youtube fodder tripe.EDIT: I never talked about the good aspects. Sorry about that.While minimalistic, the visual are definitely impressive in their own way. The massive amount of on-screen entities ispretty neat and I like that the game also sticks to a geometric kind of look. The sound design is also alright.Tl;dr: Overpriced, crappy Steam pollution at its finest. A game for 12-year-olds or people with the mentality of a 12-year old. Here's a slightly more in depth review I did of this game for my podcast (gamemenpodcast on youtube). We also discuss Youtube fodder games at large but the first half or so is about Spermination.

EDIT: Ad hominem is uncool and unconstructive to the game's critique. Sorry!Even though the developer will likely never read this review, I have to ask: As a game designer, do you think you will actually look back on Spermination proudly in 10 years? Is this what you want your legacy to be? Will you be proud to tell your children you made a sperm game? I, for one, would be embarrassed to have produced something of this caliber and actually asked for money for it. "

												A fantastic educational experience. Before investing in this experience I was under the belief that we came from eggs. Having a whole new understanding of the human body, the human life, the more natural aspects of humanity. By playing this game I believe we can learn, and become great with one another. The game makes a more emotionally powerful statement for me as it reminds me of my dearest friends last words. ""The world is a canvas for our imagination"". When Harambe told me this I new I would take it with me throughout life, and I type before you today a new man, a changed man, a better man.			"

												I uhm.. Is this even considered a game? I honestly feel like they took a prebuilt game from unity, changed a few names and textures, and then sold it. The only thing this has going for it is the music. Everything else this game is just.. It doesn't even feel like a game. Sloppy movement, sloppy weapons, sloppy enemies.. I mean the enemies are just copy and pasted turrents for christ's sake. Unless this goes on sale for under 99 cents I wouldn't even bother. You'll be bored after the first run, which will take you around 2 minutes.			"

												It is clear they thought of the name and all the puns before they made the games content well. And then they forgot the last part. The controls are jerky, inconsistent, and insensitive. There is no way to know if you hit anything. It is just a flustercluck from moment one, and you never really figure out what you are doing. It is a funny idea, but don't buy a funny idea. Buy a game.I wish I could remove this game from my library too.			"

												Just buy it already. You'll laugh, you'll get digested, you'll enjoy the disco show of turrets shooting at you, and you may even create your own gnomeling at the end (assuming, of course, that you didn't get digested instead).It's literally that sequence from Family Guy, with extra puns thrown in for good measure. In fact, it's mandatory to shout ""VICTORY IS MINE!"" in your best Stewie impression when you make your first gnomeling.I have no other words -- just buy it and play it already.			"

												I can tell work went into this, the fact that you can upgrade your sperm is neat, the general concept is amusing and the tagline is borderline genius.  But the sperm handles like a wallowing buffalo, and it's almost impossible to tell what's actually going on. Also, while I understand that the game needs to strip you of your cash upgrades in order to stretch its replay value, there is a reason most games don't do that.Honestly though, if it handled better, it would be worth it on sale, but it constantly feels like I'm fighting against the keys to move the way I want.  Since I don't know how a real sperm handles, I can't say if the developer is going for accuracy but it just made it a lot less fun that I had hoped.I like my sperm zippy, I guess is what I'm saying.

												How did I ever do this before? I am really bad at being sperm.While this game is addicting and somewhat enjoyable, I don't recommend it, mainly because the upgrades aren't permenantly unlocked, and that annoys me.I also don't like that the sperm maker is cooler than me, never do I reach the end and hit a carpet or anything, it's always digestion or egg.

												This review is highly subjective and may be overkill for a game at this price, but it's my honest opinion.I really WANT to like this game, but the floaty controls and lack of six degrees of freedom in a three-axis gamespace really kill the fun for me. Changing direction, even a little, takes a very long time. It feels more like you're on rails with a preference towards hitting walls than controlling anything (without upgraded engines, and you don't get to keep upgrades between the one-or-two minute-long runs). Only having forward and backward is fine if the movement is responsive, but I'd only enjoy this game if it had half, at most, of its current movement inertia. Regenerating weapon energy also takes far too long for my tastes, making the game very boring since you can't fire for long, and then have to wait, and wait, and wait, which is pretty awful when the aiming is primarily spray 'n pray. Maybe I'm just used to Ace Combat (6, not the monstrosity that is Assault Horizons) and Elite: Dangerous, which have tight, responsive foward-only movement and heavy, high-inertia six degrees of freedom movement, respectively. But owning those games means this game doesn't really fill a niche that exists for me anyway. It's just...not fun. ""Difficulty"" was ramped up to the point of being mostly random and the mechanics just aren't good. The randomness is supposed to be part of the fun, and I get that, but the awful, floaty control takes away the fun of the chaos and just ends up frustrating. It's more like watching than playing.I feel like it would be a LOT more fun if the developer just went all the way and made it an actual on-rails shooter rather than settling halfway between that and a 3D-free-movement style.I can see why people enjoy it, but to me this level of quality and fun would only be acceptable in a free Flash game, not a game sold for money. But to its credit, it would be a very good online Flash game.The Steam overlay also causes severe visual artifacts in-game if it's enabled (on my PC, at least) and had to be disabled in its Steam properties window for the game to be playable.

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a really bad space game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere are some different resolution sizes available.You can play fullscreen or windowed mode.There is a sound volume with % available.There is a music volume with % available.You are able to change your controls on the keyboard and mouse.About the game.So you are supposed to be some cell in a Cave (let's keep this nice). But let's say your just a spaceship in a big cave. Shooting other spaceships down and auto turrets (Yes there are turrets). You will have to survive and kill other spaceships before you have been taken down. You will also find powerups and cash which you could use to buy new things...  There is a % based thing in your screen and that is your travel meter. I have to assume you have to become first place and has reached the 100% without dying. Because once your dead you will start from the 0%Some power-up are pixel perfect while others can be picked up from a small distance.Bad control/movement.Different weapons but they all have a cooldown.Not interesting and quite boring.This game is probaly a buy-bait.Other things.You can play this in VR. But why would you do this if the game is already terrible enough?-------------------I Give this game a 1/10			"

This is easily the most epic game you never knew about.. until now.How could you possibly pass up the chance to battle in a game that puts you in one of the most important and 'against-all-odds' battles of your entire life?  This is the battle of you versus fifty-million to get to the prize first.  All others will die, fail, or just give up.  Your life is on the line....   "

												This nostalgic game truly brings back the memories of owning the noobs I went up against in my first competition. Not as dark as I remember from back then but the power ups and money system all ♥♥♥ together to make it realistic as possible.The emotional despair you feel when you've discovered you've been swallowed is second to none in video gaming. Fun game to give to someone (Not your crush) though unless you reload fast I don't think you'll be playing this for long. Don't expect an eSport scene for this anytime soon but fingers crossed.			"

												Your name is Jimmy. Ever since you were a cell you wanted to be in the sperm army. When you got older you joined. You were ejaculated in the ruins of your wife. Your main mission was to get to the egg and make it your own. You failed. He pulled out. Your life was ruined in the blink of an eye. Your freefalling to the ground. You hit the ground. And squirm until you die of internal bleeding.   6/9 would pullout again.			"

												Journey into the dangerous insides of a woman and be shot at by lasers as you try to become the first sperm to reach the egg...or stomach.  Entertaining soundtrack, a few minor bugs, buy the game when it's on sale and you won't be disappointed.  You'll also make a profit if you sell the trading cards.  (Each of mine sold for .70+ at the time of this posting (8/25/15)).			"

												This nostalgic game truly brings back the memories of owning the noobs I went up against in my first competition. Not as dark as I remember from back then but the power ups and money system all ♥♥♥ together to make it realistic as possible.The emotional despair you feel when you've discovered you've been swallowed is second to none in video gaming. Fun game to give to someone (Not your crush) though unless you reload fast I don't think you'll be playing this for long. Don't expect an eSport scene for this anytime soon but fingers crossed.			"

												Fun, Cheap little indie game. Provides enjoyment for a lonely afternoon or a snarky livestream or video. Honestly not much replayability, but what can you expect from a game that costs like a $1.50?			"
