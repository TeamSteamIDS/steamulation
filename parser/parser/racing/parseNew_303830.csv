												Visually it looks great and it's good to see some officially licenced bikes modelled well. Although I'm not entirely sure how KTM would feel about their roaring twin sounding like a dodgy arcade version of a 4 cylinder 600cc screamer. Speaking of which, the noise from the bikes will drive you batshit crazy within 20 mins and a lack of ingame music doesn't help, recommend turning sound down and draining it out with your favourite tunes. If you enjoy games that don't try to hold your hand then this is the game for you! not only will it not hold your hand, it won't even tell you what the hell you should be doing. 1.5h in and the only thing that seems to be unlocked are the first 3 races in the Beginners tournament that I have already done 3 times each. The ability to change what bike you're riding during the race not only negates the need for the stupid rough area's that restrict the sports bikes to about 85kph and allows the cruisers to excel, but it removes what little immersion the game barely offered in the first place and just feels a little silly. I was hoping to get a slightly more arcade handling version of Tourist trophy, what I got was a cheesy arcade racer from the 90's, even if it has been wrapped into a fairly pretty exterior.The cost is inexplicably excessive, and I will definitely be pursuing a refund.If you see this on a steam sale for $2.99 then sure, give it a go, why not, you won't get 2 hours of average entertainment for that much anywhere else.3/10 "

												I ride motorcyles and got it from a friend for a couple dollars despite the low reviews. With that said, I would be embarrassed if I paid over $10. I did check metacritic, which said it wasn't great and can't disagree.+Graphics+Runs well on average pc's+/-Arcade not sim (if that is desired)-Way over-priced at $40-Seems more like a novice indie game than a PS4 release!-Mediocre controls and bland gameplayIts a bit bland and controls are not the best. Its arcade style and is fairly low quality except for decent graphics.  and runs well on decent pc's. I woulds say steer clear unless if you get a big sale, even then may not even be worth your time with so many good games these days.I'm sure they worked hard on the game, but am surprised this was $40 and ps4, when its ps2 quality imo. With some more work, it could be passable for a indie game for $15. Sorry, I can't recommend it unless its on a big sale. Its okay at best, but if you have a PC that can handle Ride or MotoGP15 those are much better, but mostly sim where this is a rare arcade motocycle game. So if you want a arcade motorcycle game, you may want to get this on sale 5/10.			"

												One of the worst games i have ever played on steam as on 2017, holy cow its simply amazing just to think in terms of bike games Ride to hell is 10 times better than this trash.The downs - cancerous sounds and music- worst racing mechanic ever , the track is divided into different sections where you have to switch bikes to suit the conditions- dead ai , its very hard to lose in the game lol- waste of original bikes, they could have made a documentary video on those bikes and the game would have been better than this trash.Ups ?HAHAHAZERO , NILL , NO chance of anything good in this gameDestory all copies on sight, stay away.0.00/ 10			"

												No. No. No. No. No. NO. This is un-tested, rushed-out buggy trash. When you can actually get the game to not crash to the desktop, the bikes don't handle nicely at all either. Complete trash.			"

												I love racing games and I am fairly forgiving, but this game is dire. One of the first things you notice is that a lot of the races are on unlit tracks and your bikes have no lights. Presumably to hide graphics that are only a pinch above 16bit. Never mind, what about the sound? Hm, is my soundcard broken? Is it really meant to sound like this?! Jeez, that's depressing. So let's forget the aesthetics, how do the bikes handle? Oh. They don't. I know it's an arcade game but this isn't even up to standards set by Super Hang-0n in 1987. Summary: Complete shovelware. Not even worth the two bucks I paid for it.			"

												I don't usually bother reviewing games, but this is a special case.....This game is one of - if not, the worst racing game I have ever played (check my profile, I pretty much only play racing games).At least Motorama - my next least favourite game, didn't constantly stop working for no reason at all - see below.In getting the multiplayer achievements done, I have encountered the following: - Numerous crashes on the start / autosave screen when first starting the game. - Numerous crashes to desktop during races. - BSOD - been a while since encountered one of those - so thanks Kylotonn for that. - Controller (official X360 wireless controller with official X360 wireless receiver) becoming non responsive during races and then starting again all on it's own.The actual gameplay: - The steering of the bikes is shocking (but considering their other game at the time was Truck Racer it is about the same level of realism, none). - Why bother having a choice of three bikes that are switchable during the actual race when they are all terrible to actually use? - Jumps, glowing gates, speed cameras and dirt / rough road sections (that slow bikes right down)..... why bother. - The AI is easily beatenDon't spend money on this game.  It is really terrible.			"

												I ride everyday and ride a CBR1000 so l soooo stocked to have a game other than the Moto GP series with real bikes. The only disapointment was the game is not optimised for the PC. My alienware latop has 8Gig Ram and i7 intel and a nividia graphic card and it barely runs on min specs.....But l play Ryse that is just has good on my PC than it is on the Xbox One!!!!! So l am very disapointed l can't enjoy this game. Please optimise for the PC not just for the PS4 that this game is also on. Most of my PC games that are new like FarCry 3 and 4 and Dark Souls 2 runs sooooooo good on the PC and Skyrim is amazing!!!! and they are open world!!! why can't this game run when its a simple arcade racer? Anyway if you are a bike fan this just cool to look at the bikes and is simple fun. If you are not a bike fan, ride the bikes in Watch dogs or GTA it would be way more fun than this game.			"

												Pros:- Smooth gameplay *Very important- Well optimized game *Very important- Unlimited FPS *Very important- Nice graphics- Different gameplay style - alternate between motos while racing- Many challenges to do- Many motos to buy- Many tournaments and gold medals to get- Many achievements- Customizable keyboard layout- ArcadeCons:- Many times game crashes when loading the main menu- Sometimes game performance goes down and need to restart the game to fix- Can't customize gamepad layout, however the default layout is good- Can't open Steam Overlay, however achievements and chat messages are shown- Soundtrack of 1 music, but you can disable it- Game is too easy and bots doesn't alternate between motos			"
