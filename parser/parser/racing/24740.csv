												The game itself is good. Really good. You can make cars crash and feel like you're 12 all over again crashing your toy cars against each other and making noises with your mouth to distract yourself from your abusive parents (abusive parents are optional).It's good. If you buy this, you're buying a good game, but I can't recommend it given how Steam is falsely advertising content that is no longer available in this game. You're not buying Burnout Paradise+All DLC, or even Burnout Paradise+Some DLC, you're buying just Burnout Paradise+DLC Advertisements and a DLC storefront that no longer works.And that's terrible.

												I'm sure this review will go unnoticed but that doesn't matter.This game is seriously one of my favorite of all time. Yeah, just another EA racing game released in the 7th generation, but it's a very special EA racing game released in the 7th generation. The best EA racing game released in the 7th generation. Hell, probably the best EA racing game of all time in my book (NFSMW, B3, NFSU2 are all extremely close).PROS:-Beautiful detail. Every crash and car looks spectacular, and some views are simply jaw-dropping.-Hours upon hours of replayability. And when you do get 100%, you have a nice feeling inside.-Some of the best licensed and original music. Also, incredible classical music.-An awesome city known as Paradise City. Pretty big, and has a personality of it's own, in a way.-Very unique things you can do in the game: Ever wanted to barrel roll an F1 car into a quarry while being stalked by Black Armored Cars?CONS:-Of course, with such a large world, there will be very tedious and annoying moments at times.-Depending on the person, this will be a glaring flaw: the only real character, DJ Atomika, is a bit of a jerk.Really good game. If you like racing games, it's a must have. 4/5			"

												Overall a fun little racing game but the title is a flat out lie. You need to spend quite a bit more money to get the complete game. For this reason alone I cannot recommend this game.Flase advertising should always be punished with negative reviews. Criterion and EA knew exactly what they were doing when they called this edition of the game ""The ultimate box"", and that was to mislead buyers into thinking this was a complete version of the game.EDIT: As this review seems to have gained quite a bit of traction, if you feel the need to comment insulting me or any other people be aware I will remove your comment, do everyone a favor and keep your smug attitude to yourself. This is not facebook or reddit and I will not tolerate ignorant fanboyism from random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s online. I dont care what you think Ultimate means and I dont care how much you love the game and feel the need to defend it. Be a prick and you're comment gets deleted, end of story. That being said if you can voice your opinion without resulting to insults, feel free to criticize anything you want.			"

												Burnout Paradise is an open world, survival horror game developed by Criterion Games, who are most known for making popular racing titles. The game is set in a horrific post-apocalyptic city, ironically called Paradise City. I can assure you however, there is no paradise to be seen in this hellish landscape.You play as an unnamed, sentient car. The game revolves around completing the same missions over and over in order to upgrade your licence, to prove that you are king of the cars. The missions mostly involve destroying other cars, however, there are some racing elements involved here and there. As a working class peasant who cannot afford a luxury sports car, this appeals to my deep seated resentment of people who have more money than me.[SPOILER ALERT] The story is fantastic. Towards the end of the game, you discover that you are not the protagionist at all. In fact, you are the villian. The real hero of the game is a DJ driven to madness named Atomica. Who has been broadcasting Paradise City's only radio station the entire game. His true motives are to get all of the cars in the city to destroy eachother, so that he can free humanity from its chains and rebuild society. Many games have tried to copy Burnout Paradise's clever plot twist, and have failed miserably. Ken Levine, eat your heart out. You can never hope to recreate this masterful storytelling.In summary, Burnout Paradise is a masterpiece. There isn't a single game in existence that can match its artistic calibre. So I award this game ten out of ten cars. You will never get TYRED of this game.(A lot of people are leaving comments pointing out the similarities to Yahtzees review. Fine, but Yahtzee wasn't the only person to think of this. This was meant to be a small joke amongst friends that just happened to get popular. Whining won't make me take it down.)			"

												What a fantastic game. Just an absolute joy to drive around the really attractive city and then jump over a building and smash into a car.A great game to have a quick game here and there in, but at the same time you can spend hours completing races and discovering all the jumps/billboards/secret places.The only downside is that now that the online store portion doesn't work, you're left with a few pieces of the game being there but not accessible.The worst part is the legendary cars, they would be fantastic to have access to.

												10/10Pros:- Well what can I say, Burnout Paradise is the best sandbox racer that was ever made period. - I got over 240hrs of playtime on PS3. - Best 240hrs spent on a racer in my life. - If you buy this game, invest over 5-6 hours into it and I assure you will be hooked for another 50. Unlocking cars, finding all the jumps/shorcuts/garages/billboards is fun.The single player is a blast. The online portion is also. I was amazed that there is still plenty of people playing this online on steam, even late into the life of this game. I don't mind coming back to it every now and then. The best thing about coming back to this game is that I still have a blast like during the first 240hrs I played this game.Cons: - Too bad that the ultimate box on steam doesn't come with Big Surf Island. - You can't add your own music playlist easily like in the console version.Since this Ultimate box doesn't come with Big Surf Island and plenty of optional awesome cars in DLC format. I better go add my precious time on the PS3 version and start a new game again. - God I love this game.- I and plenty of other gamers still wish Criterion would make a sequel to Paradise. Because we would throw our money right into the screen if we ever see an annoucement trailer for a Paradise sequel.  "

												I don't usually like racers all that much, but this one is the closest thing I've seen to Skyrim for race lovers.The ""Open world map"" is a nice touch and the slow mo slam camera is wonderful.  You get to choose the type of ""mission"" you like so you're not locked to one thing. If something annoys the hell out of you you can simply do something else! It has a very chill calm ""adult"" approach to it, unlike most of those annoying prepubescent racers that feel they have to throw boobs at you and be over the top ""cool! dude bro!"" to keep you interested. Some issues with online and no window mode, but nothing too annoying.The only racer that kept me interested for more than an hour.8/10 would crash again!			"

Even though it may not be the newest, it definitely seems to have to most unique play style.  Pros Many other objectives than racesFences, super jumps, and billboards are great objectivesOver 100 different carsThe license system is very rewardingControls on Xbox controller are very smoothGreat game to drive around and listen to music toMap has a great combination of urban and rural areas Cons Multiplayer is hard to useRaces can get repetitiveMap is kind of smallImpossible to use keyboard and mouse For more in depth reviews like this one, follow the Latte Reviews Steam curation page here.You can also click here to view my page where I attempt to review all 250 of my games.

												This is a great racing game that's all about driving in the open world of people-free Paradise City, of which the title song claims has green grass and pretty girls.  Along the way, you'll be bombarded with advertising billboards for such things like Burger King, EVGA motherboards, Crash FM, and this very game.  Sadly, you can only demolish one of these billboards, which keep reappearing continuously.  Somehow, I feel real sorry for the cleanup crews having to fix up the damage caused by driverless cars.  It's like Twilight Zone stuff, man!While you repeat the events that you've already cleared with each new license, you get to hear a selection of licensed songs that usually repeat a pretty good deal.  Or you can listen to past Burnout songs from a time Acclaim published those games.  Maybe you just feel like listening to that Avril Lavinge song over and over.  Did you know that song was also in Burnout Dominator AND in multiple languages?  There are also classical songs in the game, but nobody listens to those. ;)The damage model is quite glorious, parts flying off, cars flipping about, and [my favorite /s] the game going into super slow motion because you were too slow in reacting to a barrier right in front of you.  It's like you know you're going to be taunted mercilessly, especially if you crash mere seconds before the time trial expires.  But if you feel like crashing into things and causing mass destruction, there is a Showtime mode.  It's not quite like the crash modes in previous games, but it counts for something.Even with the minor flaws like the lack of a certain bit of DLC that the potato consoles got to enjoy, super slow motion crashes that test your patience, and the general grind with each new license, this is still a very enjoyable racing game that people continue to play to this day.

												A case of paradise found, or paradise lost?I've played all Burnout games since Point of Impact, except Dominator. Paradise seemed just as exciting as previous titles in the series to begin with, but by the end it became an exercise in anger management. Having completed it on the PS3 I thought coming back to it on PC was going to be a cakewalk. If only.Enjoying Paradise depends on a lot of ifs. Where you are at in the game, how much you intend to play, and how easily things annoy you, for starters.The game dumps you on a map and basically says 'Enjoy!', leaving you to discover everything it offers for yourself. Perhaps the first and biggest wonder you'll notice is the miraculous lack of people - even the random cars you see on the road are all empty. Even your own car. Compared to games like GTA this is a bit of a sore point for me - having someone to run over and some voice-acting to laugh at would have been a nice addition. The only voice there is to listen to (besides the soundtrack / music) is DJ Atomica, who never ceases to bring you down with some disparaging remark when you lose an event. Sometimes he's ok, but the game would have been better off without his five pence of 'try harder' and 'the route you choose' bull.If driving around in Robot City isn't a problem for you then you might like this title. There is a big garage of awesome looking cars to unlock, and the freedom of having a huge map fully unlocked already means you can pick and choose which roads to use in races and events. Occasionally it can get confusing, but the option is there to check an event's route before you start it, so you can take your time deciding how best to navigate the roads to get to where you need to as fast and effortlessly as possible.Collectibles include challenges (both offline and online - online lists challenges for each of 2 players through to 8 players); smashes (which are construction fences that often fence off short-cuts); billboards (for smashing through as well); and super jumps. Just finding all of these can be a chore. In addition, each road has a fastest lap record to beat, and a crash mode record to beat. Some roads are little, others are huge. Crash mode isn't quite the same as previous games though, where you get a specific set-up and have a bunch of buses all packed together in the distance. Instead, while driving you can start crash mode at the touch of a button (but careful not to start it in the middle of a race). The goal here is to rack up a big $$$ of carnage, hitting traffic, buses, signs, anything with a $$$ painted over it. The event stops when your boost bar empties, but is filled regularly as long as you keep hitting things. This is one of the more fun aspects of the game, but it can be frustrating too, as all too often the crash traffic will spawn on roads you can never possibly reach, sometimes you'll see traffic spawn in the distance only to de-spawn before it reaches you (possibly because too much traffic is spawning on other roads), and traffic has an awful habit of avoiding your bouncing wreck trying to aim for them. Overall it's fun, but I get the feeling it needs a patch or something.Event types are colour-coded on the map, thankfully, as there are over a hundred and finding what you want can be problematic. They are broken down into races, burning routes (car-specific race against the clock), stunt runs, road rages (using your car to take out other cars within a time limit), and marked man (which is the biggest pile of doo-doo since Jurassic Park).The goal of the game is to keep unlocking new licences, ending with the Burnout Elite licence, requiring you to complete everything. Up until this last licence it is possible to avoid most events you don't like, but this last licence forces you into events you may hate. For me it was Marked Man - an event that is akin to a bull in a china shop, with you playing as the china. It seems to me too heavily reliant on dumb luck just to survive the longer distances - repair drive-thrus often being too few or too far away to be of any use. I see it as utterly preposterous and totally unnecessary. Sometimes all you can do is sit and watch in sheer disbelief as attack cars rain down on your humble car from every possible angle, sometimes t-boning you mere seconds after respawning, leaving you no room to escape at all. And to top it all off DJ Atomica will whine at you afterwards, saying you have no skill.Apologies to my brother, Grunner, and my family for all the foul language and violence when I started doing Marked Man.It's a shame but I believe Marked Man events will be a game breaker for perfectionists looking to get 100%. It can be done, but you may find items around you will get broken in your rage. Lots of excessive cinematics in the menu and waiting for cars to drop in before you can choose them to drive make the game unnecessarily longer. The menu is messed up to begin with - you use F1 and F2 to navigate various menus and a web page - not to mention the fail webpage that still tries to load every time you start the game.But the visuals are pretty good considering the game's age, and the soundtrack is pretty beast. If you're a racing fan, need more cars to play with and there's nothing better out there, then you'll get this despite the menu problems or stupid Marked Man. Due to all the enjoyment I've had I can't recommend against it, but it's pretty close. 50/50. Racing probably isn't for me.			"

												This Game is amazing. i played this game and beat it five years ago. now im back to play it again! this game brings back memories i had years ago. run very well for low end PC's and looks great on mid-high end PC's there is so much to do in this game. start a road rage and crash your competition, do a race to the baseball stadium, set some lap times, or just simply drive around. so many good things to be said about this game, for example, bikes have been added in. great sounds, fun to experiment with, and just so much to do. the cons, however, are that criterion has abandoned this game. which is a shame that all the DLC it had on Console hasnt been brought into the PC master race platform. for example, Big surf island, and cop cars, are missing from the game, and that brings a tear to my eye. it is such an amazing game, filled with action and fun, it makes you want more and more. but i will never be able to fully relive the experience of big surf island or cop cars. still, this game is completly worth $19.99, although it was made in 2008.11/10 cannot stop, and will not stop.*EDIT*apparently i cant play the game because i can only use it on one systemnow i cant play it on my gaming pcthanks ea			"

												The best racing game ever created. Don't be fooled by my playtime, I have spent over 4000 (yes, fourthousand) hours in this game on my PS3 since it came out back in 2008. I can't say anything negative about this masterpiece. There was so much content on PS3 with all the glitches, ranked racing, road ruling and endless driving. I met so many people through this awesome community, in my opinion one of the best gaming communities ever. I miss the old times, I don't regret any hour I spent in Paradise City and I will always remember every single player I made friends with. I guess it's not the same nowadays, but there won't be any game like this, ever again. I'm a little bit sad that my children won't experience something like this.

												Good game overall, although the box isn't perticulary ultimate. ""The Ultimate Box"" includes 3 out of, as far as I can tell, around 8 DLC's, one of which isn't even available for PC. Plays good with 60+ FPS on most systems. Will provide atleast 200+h of racing and gameplay until you have completely finished the game. I, personally, have sunken around 90h in this game and I've unlocked around half of the cars and just a fraction on all the jumps and secrets. But then again that might just be me being terrible at playing games.TL;DR: Good game. Tons of gameplay hours. ""Ultimate box"" isn't ultimate what so ever and will ♥♥♥♥ you over.			"

												Best ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ arcade racer I've played since Midnight Club 3.  Highly recommend.A lot of people say the game is falsely advertised, but it's not.  Nowhere in the description does it say the game comes with the DLCs.  ""The Ultimate Box"" means it comes with all of the update packs + the Party Pack, which it does.  Check the description.Without the DLCs you still get 79 vehicles, and each of them handle uniquely.$20 is asking too much for this game, but for $5 it's a must have for fans of classic arcade racers.  Buy it along with NFS Hot Pursuit for $5 and you have yourself well over 50 hours of mindless, classic arcade racing fun for just $10.			"

												PSA to everyone buying the game, you can redeem the cd key included with the steam version on origin, where it also has 4 of the dlc missing from the steam version for only $1.50. If the key doesn't work, contact origin support and they should help you like they did me.(This doesn't include Big Surf Island, as that never came to pc. Google that and I believe there was a mod being worked on to port it to pc, but I'm not too sure how far it got.)Edit: Also the cops and robbers never made it over either, but the cars did get ported in the same mod that's working on bringing Big Surf Island over.

												One of the most frustrating games to play I've ever seen. It forces you to log-in via EA's log-in system, which is frustrating to no end before you even begin the game. Then it forces you to sit through an unskippable cutscene telling you how to drive a car, and how wonderful this great city you'll spend your time driving around in. Followed by a tutorial to teach you which button is the gas pedal. Followed by unskippable cutscenes explaining every single race. It's like they knew this would be a horrible game, so they make you sit through as many cutscenes as possible so you can't actually play. What was the biggest deal-breaker, besides the boring gameplay, the constant cutscenes, and the didactic edification? You can't quit the game without being froced to pass through EA's ""Burnout Store"" so they can panhandle you to make in-game purchases. Speaking as a lover of the Burnout series, this is a sleazy and nasty puddle of bile on top of a poorly made game. There are infinitely better racing/driving games. Play those.			"

												Incredibly fun, but you'll have to work your way past the in-game sales features that were stripped out of the game when the developer abandoned it.  This means that periodically, you'll hit a button or trigger an event that takes you to an all-white screen you have to mouse you're way out of.  It may not sound like much, but it turns a complete product into a constant reminder about the developer didn't care about end users at all (oh, it's EA, no wonder).Since they didn't have the decency to patch the game and remove the offending elements (as if that would have been to difficult), this game can be considered irresponsibly abandoned, and without warning on the store page, I can't up-thumb it in good conscience, regardless of how much I enjoy the gameplay.

												First off, this is an awesome racing game, and its worth the buy, especially if its on sale. The environments are beautiful and varied, and just free driving around to kill time is fun as hell. But I feel the need to address things I saw in other reviews, so here goes.1. YOU CAN PLAY WITHOUT LOGGING IN. I forgot my login so I just have to start over. Simply hit cancel and on the next screen, ""return to game"". It will let you play offline only. Only thing is without that login you can't play online.2. There are graphics and controls options. They're in the ""Configuration"" launch option.3. Controllers seem to work fine. My 360 controller is plug and play no issues. (RB changes music) 4. Ignore the people complaining about the unrealistic physics or lack of a speedometer or manual. It's a game with arcade roots. It's not trying to be Gran Turismo.All in all it's a fun, addictive racing game that can be kinda annoying in terms of difficulty later on, but its pretty damn fun, with an awesome sense of speed.One knock on EA for not making the DLC part of the package and hard as **** to get your hands on, especially since this is supposed to be an ""Ultimate"" box.My rating: 9/10			"

												Somehow still the best open world racing game ever made.Multiplayer is surprisingly still alive, but the server is a bit of a recluse.To connect to it, you first need to make an EA account elsewhere.  If you try to log in to Burnout Paradise with this right away, the server will claim it doesn't exist.Instead, ""create an account"" though Burnout Paradise,  using the username and passord of your EA account. The server will now check with EA if it exists, which it does. Tada! The Burnout Paradise server are now aware of your account!Restart a final time, and log in with your account.

												This game represents the concept of an open world title done to almost perfection.Every corner of the world has something to do in it, and you can race your friends' times for any street. Not to mention that there's only a bunch of locations where races end, leading you to become familiar with the city pretty fast, and shorcuts are full of rewarding to get collectibles.The driving itself is good (we're obviously talking arcade here tho) cars handle nicely and there's enough variation amongst them and the 3 driving styles (Stunt, Race and bumping into things) to spice up the gameplay, not to mention that the Burning Races are a really good way of giving you sidegrades of your current cars while making you familiar with your garage and counting towards the license wins.Music is fantastic and graphics are bearable by today's standards, but good for the time.And it's a blast to play.

Seeing a car be crushed into a small cube was just as entertaining to me as an entire campaign of singleplayer content. I bought this game for PC years ago when it was on sale but never played it because I had no doubt in my mind that it wouldnt run on my potato computer. Yesterday (as of writing this review) I decided to install it just to see how bad my frames would be, and suprisingly I was able to run it at low settings at a decent 30 frames per second. It was the best feeling driving around paradise city again for the first time in 6 years. It also proved that little has changed in what can and can't keep me busy for hours on end.			"

-Quick Review-Welcome to Paradise island, the island where you can run over almost everything, jump over everything else, and crash with little to no consequences. Burnout Paradise is an Open World racing game developed by Criterion Games and released in 2009.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: You start the game with a quick introduction to Paradise Island, after your introduction you try to accumulate “marks on your licenses” to progress to the next licenses and unlock new vehicles.You earn Marks on your license by completing the various challenges, there is always a challenge at every intersection.... leaving you plenty of races, bumper cars, stunt drives, and chases to keep people entertained.The primary vehicles you'll play as are Cars, but they do have some motorcycles in the game and some “toy vehicles”. In general this has a lot of vehicles which are very much wasted on me, because I just crash into the other vehicles because I'm childish and want to play bumper cars.Gameplay: There are three car “classes”, and different stats with each car. Stunt class cars will get you boosts by preforming tricks, Aggression class cars get you boosts by being a jerk (I really like playing Aggression cars and cackling evilly as I push an NPC into the wall), and lastly Speed class cars, which you fill by near misses, upon filling the boost you can preform “burnouts” which let you boost after your boost meter runs out, so in a way you could just keep boosting... as long as you don't crash in between boosts.Like most car games, there are also specific stats on the various vehicles, some cars have high Speed, others have high boost, and still others have high Strength. Speed = you go faster. Boost = you have more boost you can charge up. Strength = your car can take a bigger beating from the competition.Achievements: There are no steam achievements for this game, at this time. However there are plenty of in-game unlockables that you can obtain. It's important to note someday there might be steam achievements, because on the Xbox there are 60 achievements on the core game, + 10 with the various DLC expansions.Price: Burnout Paradise is priced at $19.99, you can easily spend an hour for every dollar spent playing this game, there's a lot to do. That is the theme of Open world games. As I commonly do in my reviews, I suggest you wait for a sale to purchase this game, if you purchase it... I got my copy of the game on a Humblebundle.Before you buy, one final note: There are a number of reviews out there on this game saying that this game has been falsely advertised. I cannot speak from experience because I never played this game anywhere else. You're only getting the core game with the Purchase of “Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box”, in other words if you look up DLC for this game, all of that is unavailable. You cannot even purchase the DLC on steam. For die-hard-Burnout Paradise fans, that's a tough knock. So it's worth noting that you're not getting “the Ultimate Box”, you're just getting the core game.Conclusion: To quickly recap: Story – not really a selling point. Gameplay – fun, even if you're not very big on car and/or racing games. Very forgiving when you crash early in the game. Achievements – Nonexistent. Price – Fair, I suggest waiting for a sale. Remember – you're only getting the core game.All in all, this is a fun car game which can be appreciated regardless of how obsessed (or couldn't care less) about cars. I recommend this game for people who enjoy racing games, or want to give a driving game a shot, keep in mind the open world aspect is a big appeal to certain gamers rather then others. (Open world is my favorite)As always, thanks for reading my review.			"

												Are you looking for a different racing game, or planning to get into the racing genre? Then this might just be the game for you! Burnout Paradise isn't your usual racing game, but will still supply you with hours of fun!The racing genre has many subcategories, and the burnout franchise might just be an entire subgenre on it's own. You still have the basics like racing of course, but EA has a different look at racing. You can crash into things, crash other racers, make stunts while still aiming for the first place.GameplayThe main concept is still the same. You are in a car, dropped in Paradise city, have fun. The physics aren't too different from other games, but I felt that drifting has been kept to a minimum. Which isn't necessarely a bad thing, especially not in a city full of buildings and other cars.Like I said before, you are able to crash into everything, breakable or unbreakable. Remember however, that it doesn't mean your invincible. At least, not in most events. Fortunately, there are several repair stations around Paradise City so that shouldn't be the biggest of your problems.You start off with a basic car at a junkyard, and the game will teach you several things before you start the journey. However, it does barely to not teach about the controls, which is something you have to find out yourself unfortunately. If you're familiar with racing games, then this won't be any problem for you, but it may be annoying for new players.Each car has 3 stats, being Speed, Boost and Strength. It is up to you to seek the best combination which both fits your driving style and is the most useful in events. Events are scattered all around Paradise City, of which I have a few examples below:Races - I can't make it more obvious. The great thing about Burnout however, is that you decide your own route. That's right, you are not stuck on a set route where you just have to show your skills and prove your the best. Shortcuts and ramps are your best friends in Paradise City.Road Rages - Personally my favorite of the bunch. Your goal is to take out a set amount of cars in a set amount of time.Take overs - This has nothing to do with racing whatsoever, but it is still fun. Think of it as a minigame, where your car is like a ball, trying to hit as many objects as possible to get crash dollars, which are mandatory for completing the event. I will admit that this event gets boring after a while, and you have to do this event a lot if you're seeking completion.When you complete an event, it sometimes occurs that there's a new car racing through the city. You can take it out and add it to your own collection! Also, you get a new car every time you upgrade your license. Your license gets upgraded every time after you have completed a set amount of events.PresentationThe game is still part of the racing genre, but still does many things different from other games in the same genre. Instead of selecting events, you are racing through Burnout Paradise, which is the overworld itself! I won't touch the graphics however. Graphics is something strictly personal to people, so I can't give my opinion on that. For me however, the graphics are pretty good and fitting of the game. You can see far ahead of you and I haven't experienced any lagg or framedrops during my playthroughs of the game.We now have Steam music, but I still want to mention that the music selection in Burnout is pretty good. There is music for everybody, from metal to opera to classic. Of course, there is also the narrator, being the dj of this radio station, who will give you advice during the game.There are a few things I have to mention, that may not be appealing to several people. For example, cars aren't customizable. The only things you can change to your car are the colours. I personally don't mind this but I can understand that other people do.To go online, you are also required to have or creat an EA account. It's not too big of an issue, unless you are strictly against it of course.The final stepsBeating the game isn't too hard. It only requires you to complete events until you got the final license. I would recommend trying to take on as many different events as possible, because otherwise it might become boring/repetitive over time.Completing the game however, turns out to be a more difficult journey. The game does not have Steam Achievements, but there are in-game achievements called Paradise Awards. They are technically the same as Achievements, only that they won't show up on your Steam profile.I myself am not a completionist, but it does bother me that the game handles collectables rather poorly. There are Super Jumps, Billboards to destroy and Fences to drive though. Unfortunately, When you achieve a colletable, it does not show up anywhere on the map for example. You will most likely have find them all by the end of the game, but it's still a nitpick which I can't overlook.ConclusionBurnout is a really fun game that I would recommend to anyone looking for a new fresh experience. People familiar to the racing genre might find a few nitpicks, but may still find a lot of fun here. And while this may be different from most racing games, this may still be a good starting point for newcomers to the genre.While not necessary, it is recommended to play this game with a controller/ "

												This was one of the original break-em and smash them racing games. My first introduction to the burnout series was Burnout : Revenge for the original xbox. Revenge was action packed and had very smooth game play. This game compared to it's predecessor is good but lacks fluidity and solid core mechanics. I would recommend Flatout Ultimate Carnage over this as it has more mini games, is less of a grind and for me was more engaging. Unlike Flatout, Burnout Paradise let's you explore the open world with some new vehicle types. Paradise city is an open world crash-em-up racer. The gameplay is pretty sound but can have some hiccups here and there regarding fluidity. You may drive around town freely and look and participate any event that is currently available to you. To start events, simply drive up to the event circle and press the gas and brake at the same time. These events come in the forms of Burnout Route/Burnout Ride (specifically for motorcycles) in which you race the clock for modified parts for your car, marked man which you race to a specific point while dodging enemy AI players trying to crash you, road rage mode where players are required to take out a certain amount of cars to proceed, stunt mode where air time, rolls and spins earn you points and finally Road Rules. There are two ""modes"" to road rules : time and showtime rules. Time is like a time attack whereas showtime requires the player to cause as much havoc to traffic as possible. The main sell point of this game is to do ""take-downs"", meaning taking out an opposing car. Hitting cars with a good momentum will send them on their way with a nice cinematic crash video effect. Naturally, as you progress through the game, you are able to choose different cars in your garage given you've completed different events and tasks. There will be random race cars sometimes cruising through the streets waiting for you to take them down. There is no real set agenda regarding which car comes first or which car you see. Upon catching up to them taking these newly found cars out, these cars will be added to your garage. If you don't manage to take the car down or don't feel like it, chances are it will appear again (so don't panic)! There are quite a few car frames to choose from such as cars, vans, police cruisers, roadsters, classics, SUV's, F1, motorcycles and supercars. Cars have three criteria/ratings in regards to their performance. The three criterion's are speed, boost rating and strength. Different cars prefer different ways to acquire boost. Some vehicles rely on speed, others rely on aggressiveness to fill their meters while another category relies on stuns. There are other specific boost types but are very particular to a small amount of cars. Some cars have such good performance (I'm talking the special cars you acquire way after) that they do not have boost.   The graphics are actually quite good and some of the crash effects and visuals are really nice to watch. Although be it easy to knock some players out, it is still satisfying to see everything break apart. The sounds are pretty good and do a decent job immersing the player. Car sounds and crashes have a pretty good range and don't sound all the same. The game like I said is nice to play (with different vehicles such as motorcycles) but in my personal opinion is missing that umph factor when hitting opponents. The damage scheme is great, however the impact engine doesn't let you feel how hard you are hitting another car. Not only that, every time you do get a hit off the game sort of stops for a scenematic. I like fluidity; the fact that Flatout gives you a chance to recover whereas Burnout doesn't is up to the gamer to choose the preferred style. For that reason I would have to recommend Flatout Ultimate Carnage over this game. If you like what you see then I recommend it, if you want a racing game with a bit more depth and challenges I'd go for Flatout. It's an average game in my opinion without a speedometer (unlike flatout)!RATING : 7/10 Gameplay B- Story/Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B- Overall B- "

This game has a beauty that few racing games have, this is a game made with soul and it feels like one. Great soundtrack, and if you wanty the best advice from me, here you go:- set your game to night only and drive only with the classic music on. The feeling can't be described I assure you.Paradise City it's a place to be, free racing, great speed and crashes, not to mention the stunts you can do. I should know since I have a ELITE Driver Licence in Paradise City (100% game completion).10/10.			"

												Burnout ParadiseStory - Ok I'm not sure if this is story mode, but I'd count at it. I'll explain what you gotta do in a sec. There are 5 types of events, Races, Marked Man, Stunt Run, Road Rage, and Burning Routes.Races ~ Pretty self explanatory, race with other cars (or one car) to a point on the map. They're not laps, it's just get from one point to the other. A to B.Marked Man ~ Heavily armoured and fast cars are trying to take you down, you have to get to a destination on your map. It's harder than it sounds. I'm pretty good at racing games and I've failed a coulpe times at this.Stunt Run - You get points for each stunt you make, all you gotta do is do enough stunts to pass the score limit.Road Rage - Destroy a number of cars before the timer runs out. This is my favourite one.Burning Route - It's like a race, except you're on a timer and there are no cars racing you. ""Well then what's the point of this?"" If you beat the time limit, you get a better version of the car you own. They're actually quite fun. 10/10Storyline Length - A long time. Very long. You'll play for days on end.AI - On everything EXCEPT Marked Man, they're a bit weak and slow and dumb. They're still fun to play against, but I'd love a difficulty setting. 7/10Experience - You also get to play on a motorbike, which is amazing. Anyway, around 75 cars to get, and like 3 bikes to get. All the missions are fun, and there are even yellow gates to smash through and billboards to destroy! You can also set a time road rule and showtime record on a road. Play the game and you'll know what I mean. This game is awesome. Enough said. 10/10Graphics - I love them. They're not realistic, but they're not cartoony. They're just as you'd expect a game from a few years back to be. Just amazing. 8/10Sounds / Voice Acting - The radio is just amazing, I'm not even saying that lightly. It has literally one of the best soundtracks of all time. The DJ's voice is nice to listen to, it grabs your attention and the car sounds are beautiful! Some cars have a different ""rev"" sound, which is amazing. Can't quite believe the amount of detail in this game. 10/10Controls - Ok before you guys start going ""OMG WASD AND ARROWS ARENT WORKING ARHFDGNFHGNFHN"" lemme tell you the controls.A ~ Move forward.Z ~ Move backwards.Left + Right arrow keys ~ Turn.I don't know why, but I actually very much like it when the controls are layed out like that. 9/10Overall - 9/10 Hands down the best racing game I've ever played it. Finished it so many times in the span of a few years. You'll enjoy it. Buy it! It's marvellous!			"

												I'm not a racing pro nor a big fan of racing games, but i tried a few. I want to start this review with pros & cons, but these are just my opinions.Pros:Visuals -- The game is Beautiful --Open world -- I played with a few NFS titles and Street Racing Syndicate, and i dont remember that any of them had a real open world racing, and I mean racing, not freeroam. Yeah, I was waiting for that open world racing, but i must admit, that sometimes its very confusing, when you dont know where the finish line is. --Car Damage -- Yeah!!! I like the slowmo car wrecking :) --And I think thats all of the pros in my opinion. Lets check the cons.Cons:UI -- Dafuq!!! No speedometer, no tachometer... Is this a racing game or what? But atleast it has a Nitro bar... excuse me, a Boost bar --Invisible man -- I know that this is nothing, but this is not Knight Rider... I want a Driver in the driver seat --Manufacturers -- Just avoid this if you wish, but the car and manufacturer names are irritating me --Car customizing -- Correct me if im wrong, but the car customization in this game is equal to zero... or almost zero... you can choose from a few colors and paint your car. Maybe I played a bit too much with NFSU 1-2, NFSMW and NFSC, but in a STREET racing game the lack of car customization makes the game rly boring rly fast. And for me the customization, new parts, etc. count as motivation... so yeah i lost my motivation --Story  -- I know, I know... if I want a story, then I should go and play Skyrim. But even in the NFS titles I mentioned before there were events and there was a main storyline, not so detailed as in an RPG game, but atleast I was motivated, but here... i lost my motivation twice. --Publisher -- EA... do I have to say more? --Ingame Store -- Abandoned --Concluson:I really enjoyed the first few hours in this game, its an eye candy and sadly its only an eye candy, nothing more. Its the second day I play with this game, and its boring as hell. I know that my most pros and cons that I wrote are small things, but  small things can make the game good or bad. In this case in my opinion the game failed to be a Good game. Its beautiful, but not even close to be good.To be honest, if u have the chance to win this game on a giveaway, or get it free, then give it a shot, but dont waste any money on it.			"

												This by far my favorite car based game of all time. Racing, doing stunts, and destroying stuff, including other cars, is the main point of the game by doing certain missions. You unlock cars sort of quickly by doing missions and upgrading your license by completing races, burnouts and stunt runs. Overall this is a fun game for anyone who loves anything that includes cars or just games in general.			"

												I don't really play racing games and I don't really like racing games as truth be told I am not all that good, there are however a small number of games I have played and enjoyed, Burnout Paradise though is the one racing game that they have to beat though, because for me Burnout Paradise for me is the best racing game I have played since those early arcade games of the late 80's and early 90's, not that I am making a comparrison between play styles merely the amount of fun I had playing them.At the time of writing this review the game is £9.99 for the Ultimate Box which is the game itself  and all the downloadable content and despite the game's age still represents good value (in my opinion) for a game that has a lot of replayability and also is fun enough for you to want to go back to play it.Would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good racing game or simply for a good game that will be fun to play.

												At the core, this game is fun. However, what ruins it is EA. You would think that something labeled ""ultimate"" would include all DLC. This one has 3/9. Another ""feature"" is EA's incessant attempts to get you to make an online account. The gameplay itself is fun for the most part. There is a mechanic that is rather annoying. They introduce artificial lose of steering for no reason. This is when you get hit by another car (which would be okay by itself), or sometimes just completely randomly. This does not affect difficulty much, if at all, but is just an annoyance. I bought this game for $5, out of nostalgia, but I regret paying for it at all. Don't support EA and their bad practices.

												Okay so Burnout Paradise is really fun but I feel like it has lots of missed potential. Hear me out.- The open world concept is a really good idea, but it doesn't make a lot of sense to then focus all the attention in 8 points of the world map. You're basically making every other place look uninteresting.- You can pick up events all over the map... Or the city should I say, since the areas outside the city almost have none. That makes the areas outside the city uninteresting. After driving through the roads a couple of times I wouldn't have many reasons to return.- Having everything taking place in the city makes the map feel cramped and hard to navigate through. Burnout is not a game in which I want to go slowly so I don't miss anything.- Good luck exploring a whole city without turn by turn navigation. Nobody wants to open a world map while driving. No, the road signs are not enough.- The events in the city make you leave the city almost all of the time. Which means that if you want to play another event you'll probably need to return to the city, and that feels like a loss of time for the player. You should never make the player feel like their time doesn't matter, especially after rewarding them for clearing an event.- The events start to feel repetitive after a while. Even if there are many types of events, if you are always racing to the same place, it gets kind of boring.- It doesn't matter how high you score in an event since the only thing the game acknowledges is if you passed or not. A rank system would have made the experience a lot more interesting.- The menus don't feel natural at all, especially the d-pad menu. This menu demands your attention while driving (or even while an event takes place), and unless you stop the vehicle there's no way to drive and navigate through the menu without crashing. It doesn't make sense to put the ""Restart last event"" option in a place like that.- There's no explicit way to exit an event. You have to stop the car. I had to Google this. That is not good design.- The way to start an event leads to many accidental starts. You can't expect me not to push accelerate + brake in a turning point for any other reason than starting an event.- The classical music feels like a bad joke that was funny only the very first time. It doesn't fit in the mood of the rest of the game.- The idea of including different types of cars and adding motorbikes was nice, but poorly executed. It takes way too much time to find a junkyard and then change the vehicle for a certain event, not that it matters anyway because at least for now every vehicle seems to be fit for every kind of event. It makes me wonder why make different types of cars in the first place and not make just one kind. If you are going to make different profiles of playable entities at least give me a reason to use them. Choices should have a meaning in the mechanics, apart from the way the vehicle earns boost.- The respawn algorithm is just awful. Don't respawn me in front of a wall. Don't respawn me in front of a jump.- Takedowns don't feel as rewarding as they used to in other games of the series. Where is Impact Time? Why can't you do multiple takedowns at the same time?- No windowed mode?Don't get me wrong, as I stated earlier this game is really fun. But it could be a lot better and that bothers me.			"

												Serious racing simulator enthusiasts can stop reading, because this isn't the game for you.On the other hand, if you're the kind of person who loves: watching stuff slam into other stuff at 100 miles an hour, vans doing barrel rolls through the air, and the concept of ""getting extra points for driving on the wrong side of the road"", then this is DEFINATELY the game for you.In Burnout Paradise, you start off with one car. It's okay, a little slow, and just generally ""yep, that's a car"". You can unlock more cars by encountering them in the large, open-world map, and then RAMMING THEM INTO ♥♥♥♥. Then, go get your new car, and go nuts. There are many kinds of activities to loudly persue while breaking all known rules of the road. Races, ""Marked Man"" challenges, Stunt Runs, and Burning Routes (which unlock an upgraded version of the vehicle they're associated with). Now, zipping around in singleplayer is fun, and lets you get acclimated with the gorgeous (even this long after release) world of Burnout Paradise. It also lets you get new rides, and so on and so forth. But then you log into Multiplayer, and holy ♥♥♥♥.Massive, sprawling, high-speed BRAWLS of ten, twenty, however many cars just roaring along, causing destruction and mayhem wherever they go. Custom challenges, grudge-match crashing, and just general shenanigans are the norm. Think it was hard to nail the landing on a super-jump in singleplayer? Try doing it in multiplayer while four players in large, angry-looking SUVs try to ram you out of the air.In summary: Good for fun, not so good for realism. Great multiplayer potential, but solid Singleplayer. Good price, good graphics, small size on Hard Drive. GREAT soundtrack, excellent open-world map, extreme replayability.			"

												First off: THIS IS NOT THE COMPLETE GAME.     This ""Ultimate Box"" is missing Big Surf Island, the most substantial DLC which provided a large new area. This DLC was never ported to PC.     That aside, the base game by itself is still one of the best games I've ever played. Back in college my roommates and I sunk over 100 hours into the PS3 version achieving 99% completion and I was still eager years later to grab it on PC. That said, the BSI DLC was truly fantastic and truly missed here, so buyer beware.			"

												Open world racing from a top notch studio.  So much fun, it still holds up today.  The game itself is great, but ""Ultimate""... not so much.  There was more DLC available, but not all of it actually comes with this game, and you can no longer obtain it. :(  Still worth the purchase, though.UPDATE: More of the DLC is now available: the Bonus Vehicle Pack, which includes 4 separate add-ons previously available only on consoles.  You can buy a key for it on Amazon for $10, but as of just recently, you can purchase it straight from Origin for $1.49.  You'll need to register your activation key with Origin first (if you bought the original game here), and then you can get the DLC. Once it's registered on your Origin account, the content should show up in-game, even if you play it from here, as long as you're signed into that Origin account in the game.It's still missing ""Cops and Robbers"" and ""Big Surf Island"", the latter of which is a huge disappointment, as it would have added a ton more content.  It's never been officially released for PC, but there is a (perfectly legal) mod out there (still in development) that actually adds most of the content that would have been included in these 2 additions.  Use at your own risk, results may vary, and because I can't post links, you'll have to figure it out from this:  burnouthints dot webs dot com			"

												Burnout Paradise, oh where to begin... (Controller Review, I've never touched this game with my M/KB)This game is wonderful, from the up-to-date(ish) graphics to its still perfectly functioning engine and controls.You start off as a rookie driver, starting license, starting car... which happens to be a piece of junk.You complete different kind of events from Road Rages to Marked Man, Stunt events and Casual Races where you get to choose your own path because the entire darn island is your track, your paradise.You unlock new cars, which will be roaming around Paradise city and you have to take them down before you own them and get the option to drive them.You get rewarded some new cars instantly when you upgrade your license by completing multiple Events.This rewarding system makes this game in no way possible... ""Boring"", it makes it beautifully and generously amazing.after a few hours of gameplay you can already feel yourself getting better, see yourself getting better, you can gradually see each new car going faster than the previous one which slowly but surely improves your driving skill, guaranteed no matter how bad you are/used to be in racing games.all in all, this game is a 10/10 would recommend to anyone, fan or not of the Racing Genre.Also, DLC Related: If you own the game on Origin, you can buy the DLC for a $1,70 or something... and this will instantly link it through origin to your EA account in Paradise City.Afterwards, when you run Paradise City through steam and log in to your EA account.. the DLC will be on your game, even on Steam.So if you ever bought the Humble Origin Bundle, use that Origin key because it's still working! I just tried mine 1-6-2016.Otherwise you should buy the game on Origin as well, sorry :(Pros:-Amazing music, loved it.-Rodeo flipped a big ♥♥♥ tanky Van sprayed with the Burnout logo, 10/10 -Beautiful graphics.-Camera Angles on crashes/takedowns are great.-Remember DJ Atomika from your childhood PS2 game SSX3? he's back.-Perfect controller support, no flaws whatsoever.-Free roam map, player gets to choose where he/she wants to go, whenever.-70+ vehicles to unlock and choose from.Cons: -You will crash, a lot.-^Deal with it, you scrub.-Just kidding.Actual Cons:-Honestly, I can't say I found any cons, except for the DLC thing (In-game shop has been offline since the dinosaurs went extinct).\Any kind of rating for my review would be kindly appreciated!

I go to EA's site but they don't have log-ins, its Origin. I log in to origin but don't see anything about fusing Personas. If I knew what the hell the issue was I'd fix it. I'm not the only one getting this either, Duckduckgo brings me a thread on EA's site where a lot of people have this issue, and it's been marked as 'solved' but its just 8 posts with people saying they have the issue with no solution in the thread.♥♥♥♥ this game.

												Can't recommend this game enough i have played it for hours (days) completing it loads of times and i enjoyed every second of it. The game has a great soundtrack is well balanced and well made with an expansive detailed open world map. There are a few negatives, the online events section seems a little abandoned since its quite an old game now and calling this the ultimate box is a bit of a lie as there's very little extra content which doesn't include the island. despite this i hope anyone considering buying this will, i think its the best racing game out there because its the best of the burnout series and nothing better has been made since its enjoyable, immersive and fun i love this game so much and after playing for a couple of hours you will get hooked a sequel game would be nice			"

I would happily pay MORE for this game, thats how good it is.Burnout: Paradise is probably still one of the best driving games there is out there. The graphics aren't exactly incredible, but for the date of it's release, they were the ♥♥♥♥! I bought this game when it came out on the PS3, and I decided to buy it for the nostalgia, and I got exactly that! It's an incredible game with literal weeks of entertainment. Hundreds of races/missions and SO many different cars to unlock (including some DLC cars). I would happily pay £30 for this game, THAT'S how good it is. Even though the game being old, there are still multiplayer servers running, which I find really great of EA! EA is not a good company, lets be honest. But this game is actually one of their best ones. I really don't think there is any modern driving game out there which could match up to the standards of Burnout: Paradise. Driving games these days are all so samey, with no real FUN to the game. So what if the game doesn't have 4K quality graphics? I would rather play an average looking game with incredible content than a 4K game with literally no fun aspects whatsoever.10/10 - ""Best driving game out there, despite the age of the game."" "

												This game is still the best racing game available to the public, in my opinion. Criterion Games may be making the NFS series now, but they can't seem to replicate the awesome intensity of this game, not by a long shot.Paradise City is a big open box of fun, where whatever route you want to take to get to the finish line, is up to you.None of this horsing around with the side routes you aren't allowed on, if there's a path, it goes somewhere, and it's just waiting for you to find out just where that is.Burnout: Paradise follows a single, simple racing law...If you're not in first. Get there.If you're in first, stay there.This game doesn't bother you with a clunky HUD and a speedometer, letting you know that you're traveling faster than everyone else, from last place. There's no rear-view mirror, blocking your view of what dangers might lie before you.You have one objective, win the race. And staring at your speedometer, watching the soccer moms in the mirror won't help you obtain that objective in the least.Race.Race Faster.Win.What a fantastic game.			"

												I have history with this game, I remember it like it was yesterday and by yesterday I mean 2009 on the PS3. When I picked this game up I thought great it's just going to be another burnout like always... but I was so wrong. This game to put it lightly was the start of a new era in the racing genre and at the time it may have just been a little ahead of it's time.This has everything you would crave for in a burnout game, it has road rage, stunt runs, races, marked man and showtime just to name a few. The biggest and most amazing-est addition was free-roam and oh my god it is fun, with that comes a bunch of things like road rules, exploration, smashing fences and billboards, stunt jumps, hidden car parks, secret locations. Car unlocks are great you progress through and once you unlock one you go out into the open world and smash it down to collect it in your garage or you can collect some through collectibles and by completing a burning route race. Junkyards are your garages for cars, bikes etc there's also paint shops (gas stations). If your not the biggest fan of cars the ultimate box comes with bikes with there own set of races. It has online and there you can roam, race and explore with friends or strangers. Did I mention the soundtrack? OH THE SOUNDTRACK is something to admire because it's the kind of playlist you won't hear nowadays. The keyboard and mouse work fine fully rebind-able keys and the same goes for a controller straight out of the box. Navigation in this game is simple yet so good it doesn't hold your hand, you have to remember paths and sometimes rely on tail lights. The crash cams are still as good as they use to be if not better, with all the head on collisions and metal scrapping and crunching. The greatest thing about this game is the fact that the game revolves around what you progress through, there's no story just freedom.I would love to say this game has nothing wrong with it I really really really do want to say it's perfect but it's not and why is that? Firstly the big issue is the false advertising since I've been around from the early days the ultimate box feels like a scam, I mean all you get is free DLC ""FREE"" everything else you have to buy which would be fine if the store didn't shut down, if you want the awesome content you have to go through a bunch of loopholes. Secondly they left out content which are ""Cop and Robbers"" and ""Big Surf Island"" huge content missing from a near perfect game. Also a minor issue is the game doesn't have windowed mode so for all you lovers out there sorry but it just straight up isn't here.I would still say the game is worth buying because the single player is still fun and the community is some what still active, BUT if you do have the option to purchase a console copy go straight ahead because at least there you'll get a more updated version.

												I personally enjoy speeding through the city every now and then when I've got nothing else to do. It does get boring quite fast though when you realize that the map isn't as big as you initially thought, as well as there not really being a lot of things to do. You get sick of the map after an hour or so, but when playing with a friend you can still get some fun out of the game. There's different kinds of cars and bikes to choose from, but what vehicle you pick really just depends on your playstyle. Good game, but gets quite boring quick, get on a sale or with mommy's debit.			"

It features a big city to cruise around, while being able to smash billboards, security gates, and show off your car in super jumps (if you can find them). The showtime feature brings you into crash mode, which allows you to cause as much damage as possible. It has 120 events for you to complete in Single Player, unlocking more cars as you progress through the game and upgrading to the Burnout Licence. I would recommend this game for racers who enjoy racing games!			"

I paid £40 for it originally and have had so much enjoyment out of it I still think I got a bargain.			"

												I have history with this game, I remember it like it was yesterday and by yesterday I mean 2009 on the PS3. When I picked this game up I thought great it's just going to be another burnout like always... but I was so wrong. This game to put it lightly was the start of a new era in the racing genre and at the time it may have just been a little ahead of it's time.This has everything you would crave for in a burnout game, it has road rage, stunt runs, races, marked man and showtime just to name a few. The biggest and most amazing-est addition was free-roam and oh my god it is fun, with that comes a bunch of things like road rules, exploration, smashing fences and billboards, stunt jumps, hidden car parks, secret locations. Car unlocks are great you progress through and once you unlock one you go out into the open world and smash it down to collect it in your garage or you can collect some through collectibles and by completing a burning route race. Junkyards are your garages for cars, bikes etc there's also paint shops (gas stations). If your not the biggest fan of cars the ultimate box comes with bikes with there own set of races. It has online and there you can roam, race and explore with friends or strangers. Did I mention the soundtrack? OH THE SOUNDTRACK is something to admire because it's the kind of playlist you won't hear nowadays. The keyboard and mouse work fine fully rebind-able keys and the same goes for a controller straight out of the box. Navigation in this game is simple yet so good it doesn't hold your hand, you have to remember paths and sometimes rely on tail lights. The crash cams are still as good as they use to be if not better, with all the head on collisions and metal scrapping and crunching. The greatest thing about this game is the fact that the game revolves around what you progress through, there's no story just freedom.I would love to say this game has nothing wrong with it I really really really do want to say it's perfect but it's not and why is that? Firstly the big issue is the false advertising since I've been around from the early days the ultimate box feels like a scam, I mean all you get is free DLC ""FREE"" everything else you have to buy which would be fine if the store didn't shut down, if you want the awesome content you have to go through a bunch of loopholes. Secondly they left out content which are ""Cop and Robbers"" and ""Big Surf Island"" huge content missing from a near perfect game. Also a minor issue is the game doesn't have windowed mode so for all you lovers out there sorry but it just straight up isn't here.I would still say the game is worth buying because the single player is still fun and the community is some what still active, BUT if you do have the option to purchase a console copy go straight ahead because at least there you'll get a more updated version.

												This has become my go-to gaming-while-drunk game. I'm not a huge racing game fan, but this one is pretty awesome. It encourages all manner of recklessness, and driving like a maniac. If you saw it on a 70s TV show once, try it. If you want careful planning, and plotting the optimal racing line, this game isn't for you. However, if you want to put the pedal to the metal and run some losers of the roads, you're looking in the right place.			"

												Burn out it's a good car game, the gameplay is tuned to arcade mode, like driving in GTA or Saints Row). I played Dirt 2 and could'nt even finish the first circuit. It's fun to play and it says it hass over 70 cars. But the gameplay burns out really quick, all you have to do is: events like race, targeted man and destruction derby; then on the city you either discover shortcuts or detroy billboards, or perform stunts. And that is all, You can play from 5-10 hours before realizing the game is really stale pale, you either go from north to west or from southeast to northwest. 6/10			"

												In short, this is the best casual racing game for me.If you feel bored with your current game, you can relieve it by play this game for awhile.Anyway, this is an open-world racing game. So when you're in the race, feel free to drive wherever you want as long as you reach the finish line, which is good in my opinion.The another good thing with this game is, I barely hit the brake when I need to drift around the corner.so, yeah... HIT THAT MF NITRO BOOST BUTTON INSTEAD, FAM!!!Overal 8.9/10 to kill the boredom.			"

												I am not a fan of racing games. I didn't like Need for Speed, Forza or Project Gotham but i can honestly say that Burnout Paradise is one of my alltime favourite games. Pro's:Beautiful graphicsRuns well on low end PC'sThe way of unlocking cars by running them off the roadAn excellent blend of licensed songs (mainly rock based) and studio made onesintense racesLoads of hidden routes and a amazing hidden stunt park (airfield)The slow Motion crash scenes never get old Cons:Their are really only 5 racing destinationsMore experienced Racers than me might find the Race gamemode to easyThe marked man cars tend not to follow you through hidden routesTakedown gamemode is easy but really funConclusion:If you are a hardcore racing gamer then this game is probably not for you. If you are someone that is not a fan of racing games then this game will suffice for 8 Hours+ of gametime. "

												An awesome game gifted to me by a friend of mine!This game is not your traditional press-fwd-arrow-and-win-racer, because tracks for the races are not scripted and it is an open-world race. You have to know the map like the back of your hand, or constantly open the map menu to draw an imaginary track for your competition, which can get absurdly annoying while you are flying against the oncoming traffic.As I mentioned traffic- this game has somehow too much of it. I know it is a racing game, but regarding the fact that tracks are not scripted, you can crash your car each 4 seconds of a race because of a missed turn or because of too much traffic.At the beginning it is all ok, because the cars that you own are not so fast- you can predict your turns more easily and pass by the traffic, but later on it gets absurdly hard to get to the first place because of the high speeds.Overall a good racing game that is not so hardware-demanding, brings a lot of fun, but in order to ""feel"" that fun, you need to invest in a lot of time studying the city, the shortcuts, jumps etc.I highly recommend it.

												My favorite thing about Burnout Paradise is how fast the cars go. Unlike GTAV, where going too fast and crashing means dying and losing $5,000, there is really no penalty for driving at a breakneck speed and ending up in a wreck. The biggest fault of the game isn't the game's fault as much as it is Crtierion's, and that is that they never ported Big Surf Island. ""The Ultimate Box"" doesn't contain every piece of DLC, which is sad. However, the game is still my favorite open-world racing game of all time, and I don't expect that to change anytime soon.			"

TL;DR - Worth it for short-term smash-things-up fun (if you're willing to put up with the HORRENDOUS menu screens and EA cramming their DRM and EA-Account stuff down your throat forever), but it gets repetitive very quickly; don't buy if you want to immerse yourself in a new world - buy if you want to drive fast and crash into things for fun.After installing the game, it will take you about half an hour to get past all of the EA login crap for the first time.  After that (and after you get used to the incredibly cheeky way that they swap the 'okay' and 'visit store' buttons all the time), you're confronted with an unskippable cutscene introducing you to Paradise City by the one female presence in the game; speaking in (what is supposed to be) a seductive voice whilst saying stuff like ""here's the observatory"".  It's ridiculous and cringe-worthy, and pretty much sums up EA's attitude towards women here.Once you finally start playing, it's pretty much all good fun.  You can free drive around until you're in the mood to start a race by stopping at the traffic lights, and then you're dropped into either a A->B sprint, a 'takedown' contest where you've got to smash up as many cars as possible, the 'wanted man' event where two cars are trying to take you down whilst you try to get from A->B (my favourite), and finally the 'stunt' mission where you've got to jump and spin and do stuff to hit your target score.  After an ever-increasing number of these events, you unlock a new car - until there's no more missions left - at which point, I guess, you just free roam.It's fun, but very repetitive, and I found myself having the most fun just by seeing how long I could go without crashing, and believe me- it's harder than it sounds.  This isn't a game that will entertain you for all that long; you'll have to make your own entertainment, so buy at the correct price-point accordingly.Definitely not a wholehearted recommendation, but it's okay.  Pros outweigh the cons.			"

												Occasionally challenging the time limit mode, or smashing someone else's car are full of fun. Even if there is no particular purpose but also for opening the game to run a race.

												Of all the racing games I've ever owned, I have to say this one has been the most fun!It feels like the game Need For Speed: Most Wanted really wanted to be but just didn't quite hit the mark.  It's typical Burnout: silly, crazy fun with lots of different race modes in a gorgeous open-world.  Unlock better cars at junkyards, learn bigger and better stunts, beat the fastest record for a myriad set of roads or survive brutal races where you must smash a given number of cars out of the race.  For those who find bikes more fun, this is two games in one!  You can start the game in car or motorbike mode instead, with just as many stunts and unlocks to achieve.This game is also fun for people who don't generally enjoy racing sims.  It's very much arcade-style yet car handling is great with a variety of camera modes to choose from.  The AI is really well made (no rubber-banding or artificial 'cheating' that AI opponents in other games can display).  The difficulty level increases gradually and at the right pace.  It's all enormous fun, light-hearted yet challenging in all the right places.The only problem I've experienced with the game is getting my G27 Logitech Wheel working nicely with it.  People can and do have success, but my wheel has a continuous, strong pull to the left in this game which I cannot resolve.  Your success might vary, and this article[solidlystated.com] (http://solidlystated.com/software/logitech-g27-burnout-paradise/) is essential reading to get your wheel recognised and configured correctly.  Alas, my wheel pull was too much so I stick to a very old and loved Microsoft Sidewinder stick or my XB360 gamepad - still great fun!			"

While other racers have tried open worlds (Test Drive Unlimited, for instance), there have been none that have offered the same sense of freedom, ease of use, and level of polish.

												This is a mixed review, I like the Burnout series a lot, and this one is very good, but the fact that is named ""The Ultimate Box"" is what doesn´t check.The denominative Ultimate Box is just bait so you think you are gaining all the content from the Console version, but that´s not gonna happen, the content given was a free update in Console versions (Day-Night cycle, the Bikes, the weather) and the things you would expect (The Legendary Cars, the Toy Cars, the extra cities) are nowhere to be seen, not even as a DLC purchase.Don´t get me wrong, the game is good for those who love a non realistic racing game, and for people like myself who are more fighters than drivers, with a lot of events in every intersection...if you drive a car, if you drive a bike the only thing you get is Burning Route or Burning Route, no more.To call this ""ultimate"" is a joke, but if you see this game on a sale and like arcade style racing games, you´ll feel that the purchase was good, otherwise, just pass without seeing.

												I originally played the console version of this, but I love it so much that I own it on Steam too. From the soundtrack to the world design, the feeling of the cars themselves to the game modes, no other racing game has been able to match the personal enjoyment I've gotten out of this one. Coming back to it is like meeting an old friend and playing Hot Wheels together for hours -- you feel like a kid again, because the part of you that loves seeing cars go really fast and smash into each other is awoken from its dormant state.Seven years on, it is still my favorite racing game and one of my favorite games in general. Highly, highly recommended.			"

												Summary: There's lots of stuff to do. If you like racing games, you'll like this one. It's non-stop addictive. One of EA's last good games.After picking it up with the EA Humble Bundle last year, I couldn't stop. There was just so much to do. You start smashing fences for a while and suddenly, a billboard comes into your vision. That billboard's going down. Get some air, bam, full boost, billboard down. So you boost around the city, smashing more fences, looking for those sick blue cone jumps, and soon you unlock some sort of trophy-award type thing. What is this? Searching through the arguably worst menu in history, I find the list of awards. The award you just got is about smashing something like 200 or 300 fences, and you discover that there are more awards! Some for jumps, some for takedowns, some for online things which EA really sucks at, and BILLBOARDS. You look around the map for billboards. Some you can't reach, and you have to figure a way to get to it. After defeating the evil red billboards, beat up all the yellow fences, you come home victorious to the junk yard.Then you start your first race.			"

												Burnout Paradise. A good installment for the series without a doubt. Is it as good as Burnout 3 Takedown was ? Obviously not. But that's not fair since Burnout 3 was close to perfect. Is it as good as the others ? Hmmm. Debates will arise.The impression of speed is here, as good as ever. A lot of cars to unlock, drive, each of them handling differently and adpated to different situations, races, goals. A large map, with the diversity you would expect from a good game. Lots of content, collectibles, street records to set... Multiplayer ! A good one ! Still plenty of people to play with, extremely easy to initiate a race while in the world, or just hang around with friends doing stunts and flips.Then why the debates ? In what way is it different from the other installments ? One word : Open world.Yes, open world. Is it a bad open world ? No. Does it create any problems ? Not really. Then why was it not unanimous ? Basically because it's not the usual Burnout formula that we have learned to love and expect. Small issues appear with that formula. The races, as a result, sometimes seem too similar as you'll often take the same paths to get to one part of the map. You can also take a wrong turn with a small misread of the map or after a takedown, and end up losing the race just because going back takes way too long. You also have to know the map like the back of your hand if you want to win any race online. This is pretty much the only issue with the game.It IS a great game. It feels amazing and is a nice addition to the series that attempts new things while keeping the amazing basics every fan loves. It is definitely worth the buy, for any fan of racing games.Play this while we wait for the next one, you won't be disappointed !			"

												Well, let me start by saying there's nothing Ultimate about this Ultimate Box. EA being the scumbags they are, have shut down the PC store long time ago. So in short at start we don't have the DLC cars and bikes, plus the Big Surf Island update. But worry not, since on PC there is always a way, being the free platform. By googling Vanity pack and ""Unlocking Burnout Paradise DLC"" once can obtain them. Worry not it will not void anything, plus I think it is fair way of dealing with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s from EA.Anyway onto the game.Set in Paradise City, BP is open world carmageddon with various vehicles all of them which resemble well known brands from ""our"" world. This way Criterion have carte blanche to do whatever they want to the cars, including showing you the most twisted and masochist way of wrecking them. Being car in BP ain't easy.We have open world here and nods with different types of races, the usual stuff any Burnout veteran knows: Race, Road Rage and few new like Stunt Run, where you need to jump trough hoops, ramps, edges to bring up the score. The more stylish stunts the more points. Of course the more you play the more you unlock so exploration is rewarded, especially when you can find the various gas stations(boost refill), paint garages (so you can unlock all colors of the car) etc. helpful points of interest.To be hones I was hoping to be something like Revenge and Takedown since I love the track designs there. I've seen all of Paradise and I already miss the alps from Takedown or the Autumn Peak from Revenge. Still Paradise is fun place to be with various stuff and conveniently placed jumping ramps. You have half decent soundtrack but you can always start your trusty mp3 application and spin some tunes if you want.Navigation trough Paradise city is stupid and annoying. You have compass over your head, who most of the times points the right way and god awful mini map which is static and I looked trough the menus and didn't find where I can turn rotation on, since when you are in dynamic races you can mistake your way fairly easy. Yeah sure, the incoming street names blink when you have to make a turn, but try doing that when you jet trough with over 250 km/h(♥♥♥♥ Imperial) trying to do 90 degrees turn. Sometimes it works, sometimes a big ♥♥♥ crash occurs with all of the racers. In the end I bough the game for 1.50 euro so no big complains but I sure wouldn't buy it at retail price, especially with EA's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥gery ways pack behind it.A solid 7.5/10, fun game, oh and multiplayer is still alive.TL;DR:+ Same old fast paced mad racing speed+ Awesome car designs + Nice looking graphics+ Not locked on 30fps- EA's doucebagging ways: no way to obtain DLC trough the official store, since it's shut down- Big Surf Island is not in this, so nothing that ""Ultimate"" about it- No crashbreaker, the good old slow - mo where you can control your wrecked car, and score ""Aftertouch"", instead we have some half - ♥♥♥♥♥ crash mode you can start at any point when you wreck... No that awesome as in Burnout 3 and Revenge- No really breath taking tracks like Alpines form B3 or Autumn Peak in Revenge- So - so soundtrack - Dumb and annoying navigation- No Crash Events			"

												Even though Burnout Paradise has been around for over 6 years, it still holds it's own as one of the best racing games in the 360/PS3 generation and beyond. The open world environment mixed with the franchise's classic, chaotic crash system makes for some brilliant fun. The graphics, whilst obviously not flashy by today's standards, still look nice and pretty, plus the smooth framerate than never drops below 60 (on my pc at least) make for some easily enjoyable gaming.There's still multiplayer available, and often when I'm hosting a session with some friends, we get quite a few random players joining the fun.Overall, a great racing game, if you love cars, this is one for you.

												As a guy who played Burnout 2 on my Gamecube years ago, I've been a fan of the franchise for a long time. This game does NOT disappoint (apart from the annoying EA niggles, like trying to get you to log in to Origin and unpurchasable DLCs). My advice: Ignore it, and enjoy the game for the real content. The open world has a huge map and is chock-full of things to smash through, crash into, jump over, drift around and just generally lets you drive at breakneck speeds with the boost blasting. Reaction time is key, and there's different styles of events to master, and tons of cars to unlock.Easily worth it, especially if it comes on sale.			"

												A fun smash 'em up type racing game. It's a few years old but it holds up well and has decent graphics. You can have fun no matter what style you prefer: road racing, stunt runs, crashing other cars and avoiding other cars crashing into you are all options. You will have to do at least a few races that are different from your favourite to progress in the game. There are also a bunch of discoverable things and jumps to keep you busy. Sadly the expansion packs aren't available because the Criterion store closed fairly soon after the game was released, although I understand Amazon has it for US customers only. It's a pity because I would really like to try out some of the cars in the expansions. All in all a good and fun game but don't expect any patches or bug fixes in the future.			"

												It's an amazingly good racing game, horribly marred by EA's terrible choices regarding DLC.A third of the console versions' DLC is included in the ""Ultimate Box"" version.A third of the console versions' DLC was never brought to PC at all, including a whole new island full of challenges and things to do, which is a pretty significant chunk of game.And a third of the DLC is in the game, but locked until you buy it from the in-game shop wityh real money. But EA shut the shop down only a few months after release. So despite those bits of DLC being in the game, you can never unlock them (through any legitimate means) because EA won't even sell them to you anymore.I still recommend it, with reservations, but I recommend the console versions even more if they're an option. Or you can just stay away and not encourage EA to behave like this, but they're not going to notice or care anyway, so... your call there.			"

												video game (feat. video & aggro lavine's boyfrend song)good physics but hard to appreciate. they stuck with the idea of never teleporting the player so objectives are generally easy enough to not need to retry. a LOT of time will be spent watching cars crash into things in ultra-slowmo. can't turn it off even though multiplayer disables it.the map is nicely designed but the graphics dont do it any favors. even important parts of the road blend into the unsaturated scenery. there's a few hundred things to jump and crash into for completionists. the whole area is unlocked from the start and never changes so it does get stale.progression feels slow and repetitive: complete # objectives, reset map with slightly more difficult AI, rinse and repeat. unlocking cars is the main reason to continue; they're decently varied and each with an upgraded version to get.dont forget the EA-mandatory condescending announcer guy telling you how to press a button, and unskippable opening logos. also audio options dont take effect until you gain control of your car so i hope you like ACDC's viridian city blaring each time you open it.it's a game with a lot of wasted potential but i found myself pouring hours into it anyway so idk who even reads these things im gayps. dont play online with a webcam plugged in			"

												**REVIEW CHANGED FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE** - See Edit for detailsI'm torn. Giving this a negative review is something that hurts me a lot, because I really love this game and I have done for years. I get annoyed when people start their reviews like this, but hear me out. This game is fantastic. I first played it back when it first came out on the old 360, and it was a blast to pick up and play with my friends. The game is great and I had unlocked every car in the game. The driving is more than solid, and holds up well today. Got a great soundtrack, a lot of cars and an interesting world to play around in.So why the negative review for the PC version? In fact, the negative review isn't for the game itself, it's because the DLC is not available on PC any more, at least on the Steam version. This is a huge shame because the DLC has some of my favourite parts of the game, especially the toy cars pack and, in this case, the time savers pack. Of course, if this doesn't bother you, please disregard the negativity. It's a very good game, especially so with friends. If you don't want the DLC then consider this review a shining endorsement! I LOVE this game! But if you want my advice? Just don't get the Steam version. Get it on Origin instead as you can at least get the bonus vehicle DLC pack.Edit: This review wasn't really clear when I first wrote it, so I'm making some quick corrections. The game is good, don't get me wrong. I guess the biggest contributor to the issue is that the game just doesn't have any support on Steam any more, hence why I suggested getting the game on Origin instead as some DLC is still available. I am aware Criterion have moved on from this and aren't supporing it any more at all, but I don't expect them to continue supporting a game this old anyway. I've changed the review to a positive one after realising my mistakes (thanks for bringing me up on it, Illimitus). The game is great, I really want to sing it's praises, but if you want the DLC Steam isn't the place to do it. If you want a good game without DLC, this is absolutely worth a purchase. Apologies for a misleading negative review, any future reviews will not be made just before going to bed on a late night :)			"

This game is fantastic. I first played it back when it first came out on the old 360, and it was a blast to pick up and play with my friends. The game is great and I had unlocked every car in the game. The driving is more than solid, and holds up well today. Got a great soundtrack, a lot of cars and an interesting world to play around in.So why the negative review for the PC version? In fact, the negative review isn't for the game itself, it's because the DLC is not available on PC any more, at least on the Steam version. This is a huge shame because the DLC has some of my favourite parts of the game, especially the toy cars pack and, in this case, the time savers pack. Of course, if this doesn't bother you, please disregard the negativity. It's a very good game, especially so with friends. If you don't want the DLC then consider this review a shining endorsement! I LOVE this game! But if you want my advice? Just don't get the Steam version. Get it on Origin instead as you can at least get the bonus vehicle DLC pack.Edit: This review wasn't really clear when I first wrote it, so I'm making some quick corrections. The game is good, don't get me wrong. I guess the biggest contributor to the issue is that the game just doesn't have any support on Steam any more, hence why I suggested getting the game on Origin instead as some DLC is still available. I am aware Criterion have moved on from this and aren't supporing it any more at all, but I don't expect them to continue supporting a game this old anyway. I've changed the review to a positive one after realising my mistakes (thanks for bringing me up on it, Illimitus). The game is great, I really want to sing it's praises, but if you want the DLC Steam isn't the place to do it. If you want a good game without DLC, this is absolutely worth a purchase. Apologies for a misleading negative review, any future reviews will not be made just before going to bed on a late night :)			"

												This Game is fantastic, from the graphics to the stunts. I have enjoyed every minute of this game so far. Although i am one of the worst drivers in the history of bad driving, i am still having fun in this game.Burnout Paradise The Ultimate Box brings together the best console racing game of 2008, Burnout Paradise, with a host of great new content including motorbikes and exciting new online modes and challenges. Although i need to experiment to try and play online. I am loving single player, the party mode where you play against friends (not online) and see who is the ultimate driver. I Love this game.

												Really entertaining game. Growing up I would always play this game called Crashday. Although this game didn't have missles and railguns on the cars, it was still fun to play. Hunting down cars and growing your collection, something Crashday didnt have. the graphics for this game are pretty nice too, all around pretty fun game.			"

												Even though Burnout Paradise has been around for over 6 years, it still holds it's own as one of the best racing games in the 360/PS3 generation and beyond. The open world environment mixed with the franchise's classic, chaotic crash system makes for some brilliant fun. The graphics, whilst obviously not flashy by today's standards, still look nice and pretty, plus the smooth framerate than never drops below 60 (on my pc at least) make for some easily enjoyable gaming.There's still multiplayer available, and often when I'm hosting a session with some friends, we get quite a few random players joining the fun.Overall, a great racing game, if you love cars, this is one for you.

												When people say that Burnout Paradise was a high point in the last generation (as of 2014) of racing games, it's not hyperbole or due to a large amount of cash. It's because it's that good.The gameplay is still extremely fun by today's standards, and so are the graphics. There is just so much to find in the city, be it races, parking garages, Super Jump ramps, drive-throughs and those pesky fences and billboards. Be prepared to spend hours trying to beat your friends' Road Rule scores as well.The motorcycles are certainly a welcome addition to the game, adding a whole new learning experience to the gameplay due to the different manner bikes and cars behave. If only they had released the other DLC on PC or at least bothered keeping the Burnout Store online...If you ever have to limit youself to just one arcade racing game, make it this one.			"

												Burnout Paradise. A good installment for the series without a doubt. Is it as good as Burnout 3 Takedown was ? Obviously not. But that's not fair since Burnout 3 was close to perfect. Is it as good as the others ? Hmmm. Debates will arise.The impression of speed is here, as good as ever. A lot of cars to unlock, drive, each of them handling differently and adpated to different situations, races, goals. A large map, with the diversity you would expect from a good game. Lots of content, collectibles, street records to set... Multiplayer ! A good one ! Still plenty of people to play with, extremely easy to initiate a race while in the world, or just hang around with friends doing stunts and flips.Then why the debates ? In what way is it different from the other installments ? One word : Open world.Yes, open world. Is it a bad open world ? No. Does it create any problems ? Not really. Then why was it not unanimous ? Basically because it's not the usual Burnout formula that we have learned to love and expect. Small issues appear with that formula. The races, as a result, sometimes seem too similar as you'll often take the same paths to get to one part of the map. You can also take a wrong turn with a small misread of the map or after a takedown, and end up losing the race just because going back takes way too long. You also have to know the map like the back of your hand if you want to win any race online. This is pretty much the only issue with the game.It IS a great game. It feels amazing and is a nice addition to the series that attempts new things while keeping the amazing basics every fan loves. It is definitely worth the buy, for any fan of racing games.Play this while we wait for the next one, you won't be disappointed !			"

												This is one of if not the best racing game that I have ever played! Almost everything is spot on, and there are very few annoyances. The graphics, gameplay, music, and the design of paradise city are fantastic! the city, the cars, and everything else are very well detailed. The gameplay is tight, esponsive, and the controls feel perfect for this game (if you're using a controller). Almost all of the music fits very well into the world and atmosphere that Criterion has made, but I can't say that the music is great (I think it is) because that's all up to youand your personal taste. And Paradise City is a very well crafted open world that is a ton of fun to explore full of seceret areas and shortcuts that help you win challenges! the only major negative that I have is that you sometimes feel like you cant avoid a crash. Mainly because you sometimes cant see a car, wall, pillar, ect coming until it's too late. That can get pretty annoying, but it doesn't happen all that much. Overall, Burnout Paradise is a very well crafted skill based racer that doesn't hold your hand, but never feels very unfair with great physics, world design, controlls, fitting music, and graphics. I deffinatley reccomend this game to all who want to try it, or are even just slightly interested in it!			"

												The best 10 bucks (50% Sale) I have ever spent. While it may only say around 100 hours on my account, I have spent at least double this on offline mode and am just blown away by this game.PROS: - Great physics (apart from poles, boost and barrel rolls) - Massive open world that takes ages to fully explore - Super jumps, billboards, smash gates & street times to find and beat - Absolutely unbeatable graphics (including time of day) for a car-racing game - Change of environment from downtown, to harbour, to beachfront and lakefront to mountainous countrysideCONS: - Online play seriously flawed - ""Driveaways""impede race flow - Occasionally Windows 8.1 Computer freezes upon tabbing in (about 1 in 5 chance)Overall though this is a fantastic game in which the pros greatly outweigh the cons and I give it a rating of 9.5/10 flying, crashing and speeding cars through a massive city.

												An open world racing game that's fun, but has its flaws. Let me start off by saying that I enjoyed this game and it was really fun, but it eventually got really repetitive. Much like other games that have one special gimmick/concept, something else will suffer. Despite taking place in an open world and giving you the idea that you can do whatever you want, you are limited to what you can really do. There are 3-5 different racing events and the only thing that really changes is how difficult they are and where in the city they take place. This concept almost reminds me of the first Assassin's Creed. For the first few hours you're enjoying yourself, but then you realize you're repeating similar tasks over and over again. Along with the use of repetition, the compass/mini map system can be confusing. Since this game takes place in an open world, you're not really racing on a conventional track. Though the compass/mini map is there, you can essentially choose which route to take. What's confusing about this is that the compass/mini map is a pain in the ♥♥♥ to use. It wasn't until I was nearly halfway done with the game that I realized that the compass would guide you on which street to take just as you were nearing it. While this is helpful, it's also difficult to maintain a sense of direction seeing as how you're driving a car at ridiculous speeds and even the slightest turn can alter where you end up. Though it may seem as if I completely hated this game based on what I'm discussing, I enjoyed it. It's not perfect, but it's a good arcade racing game that should keep you busy for ~15-20 hours. I give this game a 3/5 and I recommend it.			"

												This must be my favourite racing game. The feeling of speed is exhilarating, the driving arcadey but still allowing for precise handling. The city is large, wide open and accommodating to speed freaks, road ragers and stunt devils.This is a game where I speed up my car just to try and crash it in the most spectacular way, watching the metal crumpling in slow-motion and tapping the screenshot button.The online implementation makes it extremely simple to get an online race going.

												I'd say that, for a PC Racing Game, this is pretty good... but not perfect.For the good, i will say the controls work pretty well with both Keyboard and Gamepad. Of course, the gamepad works a bit better, but it's one of the few PC racing games i can say i'd actually play with the keyboard.Secondly, the open world is fantastic. It's really large, open to exploration, and just damn fun to drive around in. And finally, all the cars feel unique. Even the clones of the same car, such as the Customs, still feel really good, even different compared to the regular version.But it does have some problems.Not gonna complain about the dlc, but what i will complain about, is the CRASHING. I don't mean Car Crashing, i mean the Game Crashing. It happens randomly, and there are no signs it is going to happen, just one second you're happily driving along, the next, the game crashes. And it happens ALL THE DAMN TIME.Secondly, while it looks great, there are some texture quality problems at times. That's all i'll say about it.I personally can say that i have enjoyed this game quite a good bit, but it's not without faults. I'd reccommend buying it if you have the spare money.			"

												Blast from the past.I remember having this on PS2 and I couldn't stand it, I purchased burnout paradise expecing modes such as crash and being able to setup split screen games for races and takedowns and was rather guttered with the new mechanics of this game.This, however, was a long time ago and I picked this up on offer to give it another go and my god I was missing out. Although its rather old now, the graphics are not all that bad and it plays really well at 5760X1080 and I spent a night racing through it and enjoyed every minute of it. I havn't played alot of this game as I bought alot during the last steam sale but once I have an urge for a racing game I will be coming back to this to complete it, great game and strongly recomend purcashing this on a sale.

												If you like speeding through cities, dodge traffic and ram your opponents into walls (or the aforementioned traffic), then this game is for you.Featuring an open city, a variety of cars and events, a so-so soundtrack and the never ending joy of bashing opponents to smithereens, Burnout Paradise offers arcade racing fans a treat.If you want to crash into some human enemies, go online and partake in pretty much everything you did in singleplayer!What I'm enjoying most online, though, are the co-op events, where the players unite (more or less) to achieve a common goal, like managing to get to a certain place or do barrel rolls over each other.It's a bit sad that Paradise may be the first and last Burnout making it to PC, as Criterion (and especially EA) seems more focused on Need for Speed. What's also sad is that one of the bigger DLCs never made it to PC: Big Surf Island, which not only includes a whole new are to explore, but also new game modes and cars.But rejoice as modders try to bring exactly that to the PC! It's already playable, although it's still missing a lot of stuff, including singleplayer events, traffic and game modes, but you can explore Big Surf Island, drive a lot of new cars (including whatever cruises through Paradise) and partake in online events!It's called the ""Vanity Pack"". Go and get it. Seriously.And while we're at DLC: The in-game store has been shut down a long time ago, but you can still get the Legendary Cars, Toy Cars and the Boost Specials from retailers like Amazon.All in all a fantastic game. Get it! "

												Awesome open-world driving/racing game.  The same developer as NFS: HP, MW and Rivals.  You can challenge your driving skills in Paradise City with lots of different kinds of cars, even bikes!  6 different boost systems give you lots of fun.  If you like free roaming in open world and racing game, you should try Burnout Paradise.讚讚的開放世界賽車遊戲，與極速快感: 超熱力追緝、新全民公敵、生存競速的開發商是同一個，你可以載天堂市挑戰你的駕駛技術，不但有各種車子還有機車！六種不同的加速系統非常有趣，如果你喜歡在開放世界晃晃、又喜歡賽車遊戲，那你一定要試試看Burnout Paradise。			"

												I fell out of driving games for a number of years, but this one looked like too much fun to pass up. And now I'm hooked on them again! This game is so much fun, I almost feel guilty. I'm trying to squeeze a race or a Road Rage session into every spare moment I get. The soundtrack can get a little monotonous after a while if you're not careful, but the gameplay, graphics, sound, car unlocking, achievements, free exploration... it's all just a ton of FUN. I highly recommend this one if you like cars and driving games. I use an XBox 360 Controller on my PC for this one, and it works WONDERFULLY for it. GET IT!			"

You're a driver in Paradise City and by completing challenges you're rewarded with new or upgraded cars as well as an upgraded driver's license. You'll find yourself spending a lot of time on the singleplayer if you buy this game. The multiplayer is also amazing.

												The game is immense and easily my favorite car game of all time.75 cars in the basic pack, each with a basic ""Type"" which is how it accumulates boost. You'll be doing a lot of boosting. And they all feel a little different than one another. They have since added several different packs of cars, so many that I honestly can't count, with their own challenges. Every stoplight in the game is a different mission. The game itself is pretty straightforward, there's a location at each compass point of the city at which all the challenges end, and they come in a few different flavors loosely coinciding with the car types. Beyond that, drive around a big-♥♥♥ city at enormous speed, creating breathtaking car crashes and listening to classic rock and trying to get your next car unlock. Cons: Not gameplay related, but rather EA's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port programming. You will probably need to configure your own controls, although the game makes it pretty painless. I also had a problem caused by the game's attempt to take my picture for my driver's license (don't bother, it's VERY glitchy, but a cool idea)--every time I tried to open the menu it would crash. Fixed it by turning off the webcam driver (I don't have a webcam) in my control panel and it's been running smoothly ever since.Anyway, technical problems aside, this is the Skyrim of car games and you should get it if you have even a passing interest. I don't like racing games but I love this damn game. For 5$ in a sale, it's a no-brainer.Edit: in case you were concerned that my playtime is too low to be this positive, I have at least 30-40 hours on the XBox version. I was very happy to return it to my library on steam by buying it a second time.			"

												Very fun arcade racer. There aren't that many games where I'm thinking ""Oooh ♥♥♥♥, I can't believe I'm moving this fast and haven't crashed"", and just feeling in the zone while driving. The game has a few annoyances, like in-game billboards for real products (which feels extremely tacky and ♥♥♥♥♥y every single time and never wears off), and having to sit through tedious slow motion crashes over and over again, often crashing through no fault of your own. But overall it's a game I've come back to again and again.Controller support is excellent with the xbox360 pad (though there is a one-time bug where it doesn't get detected if you've already lauched the game without the controller installed, but deleting the .ini forces redetection). The graphics hold up well, while still delivering a rock solid 60fps on my (by now) mid-range PC.For what it is - it executes very well.			"

												DISCLAIMER!!!!!!! This DOES NOT include any DLC despite what the title says.I have been a huge fan of the entire Burnout series from day one it is an amazing arcade style game with a ton of different races and modes.Burnout Paradise is by far the most different of them all, think of it as Need for Speed (Carbon/Most wanted) and Burnout had a baby this is that baby unlike other Burnout games when you finish a race the game doesnt go back to any menus or anything it puts ou back into an open world where you can drive around doing whatever you want until you decide to race again which i always loved in the Need for Speed games that had it.But like I said this is not the ultimate box so if you are buying it expecting DLC then just stay away but it is the base Burnout Paradise game which is an amazing game by itself idk if the online modes work or not I dont mess with those but the party play is fun if you have friends over and want to play each other.The soundtrack like all other burnout games is awesome and the world and cars are beautiful this one really shows the damage done to your car better than ever before and the slow motion crash cam is great.I recomend it if you are ok with not having the DLC I suggest getting it on sale though but thats a given with any and all games to me.

												Still undoubtedly the greatest open world driving game ever made. Set in the best vehicular playground imaginable, the game drums the layout into you; forever learning new paths to destinations and finding new areas to play in. Events make use of every inch of road, alleyway and rooftop, leaving you to find your way through a race or across the city bursting through billboards in Stun Run. The cars and bikes are simple to handle, stipping away any element of complexity or realism, but leaving purely refined speed and destruction carnage. Paradise is just that, every Burnout, Need for Speed, Gran Turismo and Forza distilled down into a twisted chassis and boost bar ready to burn.			"

												Burnout Paradise is a great game. Probably one of the best open world games that I've played. I might be a bit bias since this game brings so much nostalgia when I used to just play this with friends all night on Xbox360 and singing the Guns n Roses song ""Paradise City"". Info: Burnout Paradise was made in 2009 so don't expect 4K graphics but it does still have good quality graphics. In PC requirements circumstances you can play this  game on max vid settings on mostly any PC or to be more specific you can run it on high if you get 40 Frames on CSGO,GMod,LoL. Here is a short P&C list and overall review for you guysPro's-Simple and very easy to jump into game-Open World that actually doesn't get boring -Soundtrack mix is gnarly-Jumps are f'ing awesome-Cinematic Cams are cool-Concept of different cars and EventsCon's-EA account login is stupid-Multiplayer is dead(who cares  though)-No more add ons you can buy since it's outdated-Bit glitchy at timesOverall Review: A must buy for all avid Racing or Open World gamers.

This game is hard in a good way, like it takes a little while to beat something, but then you finish the challenge with a few seconds remaining and you're like **** YES. 10/10 would drive again			"

												Great game. Bad DLC implementation. The ""Ultimate"" part of ""The Ultimate Box"" likely refers to this being the last boxed version of the game. Sure it has everything released up till then, but more DLC came after, and most of it is difficult to impossible to get with a Steam copy of the game. You can get more on Origin (so I hear), but I haven't had the time or inclination to find out for sure.But seriously, this is a great game. I've loved the Burnout Series since Takedown, and while it's nice to see some Burnout rubbing off on EA's other driving series, Need For Speed =/= Burnout. Heck, Forza Horizon has been cribbing from Burnout with bonuses for reckless driving (oncoming, near misses, etc.). Whatever. If you like over the top racing action, you can't do much better than Burnout Paradise!			"

The only downside i will note is that i am sad that this does not have the console dlc i really wish that they would bring surf island to the pc.

												This game is getting older as we speak. The game is a classic and is really the best Burnout game in the series, I love this game personally and can play it for hours with its multiple missions and many different cars. The cars in this game... Well I love them really, starting the cars driving them at high speeds through the city and the hills. There are many DLCs ,which you know I hate, but there is a definate way to bypass that. The cars are all interesting and really fun to drive, the handling is very easy and you can definatley feel the freedom when you're driving.Firstly the cars in this are awesome! You can get many styles of cars such as: Rage, stunt, street and that wierd turbo thing that only lets you recharge... The entire car system has many different styles of driving, the cars can be stock or the upgraded unlocked version of the original car. You can get mini cars, police cars and many more random types of new cars which can only be found on the origin store. The DLC for paradise island is only avalible for the console versions of this game but you can mod it into the game which adds buggys and a whole new island. The entire games map is massive compared to new games and its nicley detailed, the whole thing has events placed ""at every intersection"" as explained in the first part of the game which is true! Events on every intersection which can be played again but only to beat your score.The map concludes of beaches, mountains and city scapes with loads of driving to do. I had some technical problems with the game trying to set up multiplayer, EA actually sent me a copy onto my Origin account which then worked. The games multiplayer consists of free drive, races, stunt runs and free races (which is where you set up your own races for your friends). I like playing with my friends because you can have a lot of fun seeing who can get the biggest air alltogether in a certain place or just driving for fun. Multiplayer does have a negative side to it though, its very anoying to setup with multiple game platforms Steam/Origin but I was the only one with this problem.The game does have DLC but noone wants to pay for that so some nice modding community have recreated Paradise Island from the Xbox and Playstation games, the mod also allows you to change cars at random points and adds all of the DLC without EA coming to rip your wallet apart. The DLC is quite fun and you can have lots of random moments with your friends. The mod also allows you to change to any citizen car with any paint scheme which is a nice feature.Only problems that I had. On a Windows 7 Computer it worked fine for a series of time, it would crash ocasionally but that might of been because of my older setup. The game works well with old and new Windows but I had some problems with a Win10 machine, but my friends computer (WIN8) worked fine. I was trying to get the game running with two monitors but then I realised I my older setup was screen center to left which for some reason broke burnout completley but when I disconnected it, the game ran smoothly.You can have hours of fun on any burnout game but especially this one with its free world and ability to choose to do missions when you want to. So I recommend buying this, but remember to play it with friends because it is extremely fun messing around with some areas!			"

												This game is great fun, absolutely.But why call it the 'Ultimate Box' when it isn't an 'Ultimate Box'?Let me tell you, one of the main things I wanted to do in this game was get the DeLorean, but you can't, unless you buy a code cause the in-game store is closed, forever. You can't buy anything from the store, this is real $$$ by the way. That really let me down, this is just a game, not an 'Ultimate Box'. The game should come bundled with all the DLC for the game, not just have it installed and not be able to use it.So just letting you guys know, this is a great game that was made ages ago but disapointing without being able to purchase the DLC cars.So if your like me, and want the DLC cars, maybe buy a code before getting this, but if you just want the game, then by all means get it, it's worth it.At least Steam Refunds are a thing so I can get a refund if I can't get the Delorean and if I lose interest in this game, which I doubt.

DO NOT BUY THE £4.99 ON HERE.go on {LINK REMOVED}♥♥♥.com and you can get it half the price. its not worth paying £5 when you dont get the benefits from it that you were expecting.Game Review:NOSTALGIC. started playing this as my first game on ps3 and loved to play this game again! the action packed races to the adrenaline rushed free roam. you will be hooked in seconds. pretty good graphics for the game it is bearing in mind it is fairly old now! I play this game in the max settings and it is an absolute blast to play with. really brings the game to life.OVERALL RATING 7/10 (lost 3 due to not being able to have dlc, apart from that the game is AWESOME!!!)

												Graphic is nice and the game is much fun to play.> PROSThe world is pretty big and heterogeneous, maybe just with a bit too much ""shortcuts"".Cars are either accurate (I felt like I was driving a proper Lancer) or funny (in a good way).Challenges are as they should be, easy at start and hard (but still not insane) toward the end of the game.You get to listen even classical music on the ""radio"" and so music is good...> CONSSadly the login/login-server system is a huge mess (couldn't ever connect to game-servers because the game crashed if I tried so).Running through the city is fun but not being able to pick a race without moving to the starting location ""manually"" is a bit stressing after 5+ total hours played. Also, to compete ""equally"" in every type of race you have often to change your current car for another (moving to one of the ""bases"")... additional stress.The menu system is just plainly wrong and confusing.To recap, the game itself is quite good and enjoyable but it's still a console port and most of the cons come from that.

												One of the best racing games out there. No matter how many years have passed since it launched, I still come back to it to have fun racing and crashing cars.HOWEVER, beware many people, including myself, are having problems starting up the game. I believe the game servers shutdown, and ever since it's been a pain to get it working. Startup game homepage (there is an ingame browser that starts everytime you start the game, before opening the actual game) is broken, so working around this to get the game working is a painful process, unless criterion releases a game patch.In the mean time, go to the file burnoutparadise.exe location (right click in steam game, properties, browse file location), and then in windows explorer right click the burnoutparadise.exe file, set it in compatibility with windows xp sp3, and that will do it. It did it for me, after a research on the web on how to make it work.If you have the option to get this game on console, is a different story. The consoles work with no problem (ps3 and xbox 360), but the game will not be as beautiful as it is on PC. It's your choice.One of my favorite racing games of all time.			"

												This is a good racing game.But instead of just racing, you can also take down your enemies, easily the thing that sets the game series Burnout apart from others. And it's very fun. Another unusual thing is that, while you're racing (or are playing the other modes), there are no arrows to guide you, no boundries. You must rely on your mini-map and / or compass to get to the finishing line. The game has a massive open world with over four hundred shortcuts that you can learn in order to get to the finishing line quicker than the others can. There are also some other ""collectibles"". You also find events (Racing, Marked Man, Road Rage...) only by exploring the map. The main goal of the game is to get a Burnout Driving License, which you can only get by winning the aforementioned events. You get cars every time you upgrade your license, and when you shut down certain cars.The game also has an online mode, where you can play the same events that you can on singleplayer, but with actual people. Sadly, Race is the only properly made event, as the other ones really haven't had much love given to them. When you're not doing an event in multiplayer, you're on freeburn, where you try beating other people's records (no. of barrel rolls, air distance, etc.). It's quite fun, even if it has its flaws.Now, let's talk about the port: it's bad. The online mode doesn't even have a chat. You can only communicate with other people with voice chat. The menus are really odd too. The optimization is alright. I do have some FPS drops in areas with lots of cars and action, but you can kinda blame it on my PC (although I expected it to perform a bit better regardless). The fast menu is also impossible to access unless you have a controller, which is a problem because that's the menu that allows you to change teams in certain multiplayer events such as Road Rage.Overall, it's a good game. And it's cheap. You don't really need a controller, the keyboard works just fine. It has its flaws, but overall you should get it if you're a fan of racing. 8/10 "

												Back in my PS2 days I owned Burnout 2 and Takedown and loved the games - played them to bits. When I saw this was up for grabs on a  Steam sale I jumped at the chance.The game is not quite what I was expecting. It's very different to what I thought it would be. That's not to say some of the changes are not for the better, but on the other hand, some aren't.Graphics look brilliant, and the cars still have that same Burnout ""feel"" to them. The game modes all make a return too - but this time in an open world map. Think NFSU 2 and you will be on the right tracks. This is great, but you seem to spent a lot of time driving around for no reason. I would much prefer to just race and perform the stages without this unnecessary addition. The races themselves also suffer from the same problem of being given too much freedom - you will accidentally go the wrong way because you are concentrating on driving and not constantly looking at the map.O yes, and no 2 player split screen? Not good :-(Bar the problems I have with it though, it's still a good game. Burnout fans will find something to their liking here.Jimbo Rating: 5/10			"

												Great graphics and sound. However the announcer is annoying sometimes. Wish he would stop talking so much.  I also wish the city had people walking around would give the city more life.  The fake city they use is very big and colorful. The cars look great and the damage model is very good indeed. I have not tried online play. The biggest knock against this game besides the lack of a true gps system was that you could not restart an event if you failed it. Sure you could drive back to the event but that may be very far away and take a while. However that has been fixed and now you can restart a failed race removing a lot of the frustration I had with the game. The cars handle well and the racing is somewhat varied.  This edition does not include the dlc island that was only for the xbox however if you search you can find a fan made island made for this game. The game is great fun and I do recommend this game to all. 9/10 a great game.			"

												Game #4 - Burnout Paradise: Ultimate Edition (PC)November 5, 2014In the world of Racing games, the Burnout series is more about creating chaos and less about the racing skill. This type of experience is not unique to just racing; in Football games you have NFL Blitz, and Basketball has NBA JAM. As with the others, Burnout Paradise offers over-the-top speed, jumps and crashes. This entire experience is similar enough to it's predecessors, but offers players the newer concept of exploration in an Open World environment. The updated game design, graphics and expanded multiplayer makes this a game that needs to be played.The overall experience of Burnout Paradise is somewhat discounted from the other games in the series. Luckily this was neither a good or bad move on an already fun game, but a choice to try and update for the future of the franchise. Although there are changes like the Open World exploration, a majority of events made there way to to Paradise. Players can stop at many traffic singles and hold LT and RT to begin events like Racing, Wanted Man and Takedown. Additionally, there are events specific to each vehicle, which are acquired by taking down cars after major races. The final addition to Paradise was the introduction of Motorcycles. While not as simple as cars to maneuver through the city; they create a unique challenge for even the most seasoned Burnout racer.Burnout Paradise release on January 22nd, 2008 for the Xbox 360 and PS3. A little over a year later EA brought it to PC on February 8th, 2009. At full price of $59.99 many people would have snatched it up immediately. This also lends to the Metacritic score of 87 making it a very well received game. In my experience, which is being familiar with the franchise and game mechanic, I would give it a solid 8. In today's market, you can probably pick up the Consolehttp://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box Edition for $15-$20, and depending on the PC key sale, you can pick up the Ultimate Box edition for less than $10.  Well worth the money, the introduction of Open  World exploration, and the quick and painless way to find a new race event, made this a better experience.

												So good!!!  Still my favorite game of all time.  Open world racing, spectacular crashes, awesome soundtrack.  Vehicles: Cars handling is very arcade-y, but very fun.  There are a number of cars with twitchy handling that require more than just throttle mashing to win the races.  A Burning Route time trial event for each car unlocks a slightly upgraded version of that car.  The addition of motorcycles is a nice change of pace with their offline time trial events.Stunt Runs, Road Rages, Marked Man and Race events can be played online or offline.  In addition, there are hundreds of online challenges for 2-8 players.  When you find a good group of online players, it is a lot of fun.Showtime: Crash your way down the road racking up as many points as possible.  Destruction has never been more fun.Road Rules: Set a fast time for every road on the map.  You'll be cursing the traffic but that clean run is so sweet.Criterion, please take a break from Need for Speed and make another Burnout already.Sidenote:  I played this game all the way through to 102% on the PS3 in 2009 and just recently bought it for the PC.  It looks SO much better on the PC.			"

												Not an amazing game in the least, but it is definitely fun.  I really enjoy games that set you up with challenges to beat.  I have never been much of a racing game fan, but this game is not really meant to be taken seriously.  You do crazy stunts, crash your car into others for points, run from other racers chasing you, and just flat out race.  Also, the little mini challenges are nice.  Trying to beat the best time on a certain street really keeps the game interesting.  Just a nice little simple game where you just have to progress, unlock better equipment (cars), and beat your best scores.  I like it and recommend it.			"

												Back in my PS2 days I owned Burnout 2 and Takedown and loved the games - played them to bits. When I saw this was up for grabs on a  Steam sale I jumped at the chance.The game is not quite what I was expecting. It's very different to what I thought it would be. That's not to say some of the changes are not for the better, but on the other hand, some aren't.Graphics look brilliant, and the cars still have that same Burnout ""feel"" to them. The game modes all make a return too - but this time in an open world map. Think NFSU 2 and you will be on the right tracks. This is great, but you seem to spent a lot of time driving around for no reason. I would much prefer to just race and perform the stages without this unnecessary addition. The races themselves also suffer from the same problem of being given too much freedom - you will accidentally go the wrong way because you are concentrating on driving and not constantly looking at the map.O yes, and no 2 player split screen? Not good :-(Bar the problems I have with it though, it's still a good game. Burnout fans will find something to their liking here.Jimbo Rating: 5/10			"

												This is a good racing game.But instead of just racing, you can also take down your enemies, easily the thing that sets the game series Burnout apart from others. And it's very fun. Another unusual thing is that, while you're racing (or are playing the other modes), there are no arrows to guide you, no boundries. You must rely on your mini-map and / or compass to get to the finishing line. The game has a massive open world with over four hundred shortcuts that you can learn in order to get to the finishing line quicker than the others can. There are also some other ""collectibles"". You also find events (Racing, Marked Man, Road Rage...) only by exploring the map. The main goal of the game is to get a Burnout Driving License, which you can only get by winning the aforementioned events. You get cars every time you upgrade your license, and when you shut down certain cars.The game also has an online mode, where you can play the same events that you can on singleplayer, but with actual people. Sadly, Race is the only properly made event, as the other ones really haven't had much love given to them. When you're not doing an event in multiplayer, you're on freeburn, where you try beating other people's records (no. of barrel rolls, air distance, etc.). It's quite fun, even if it has its flaws.Now, let's talk about the port: it's bad. The online mode doesn't even have a chat. You can only communicate with other people with voice chat. The menus are really odd too. The optimization is alright. I do have some FPS drops in areas with lots of cars and action, but you can kinda blame it on my PC (although I expected it to perform a bit better regardless). The fast menu is also impossible to access unless you have a controller, which is a problem because that's the menu that allows you to change teams in certain multiplayer events such as Road Rage.Overall, it's a good game. And it's cheap. You don't really need a controller, the keyboard works just fine. It has its flaws, but overall you should get it if you're a fan of racing. 8/10 "

												What an awesome game. While it is true that this game is about smashing other cars with even bigger cars or flying through the streets with a GTR car, there's more to that than it seems at the first glance.This is an open world racer, and, unlike Need For Speed or other games of that sort, this is not only about how hard can you drift, but also how well are your navigation skills. By far the most exciting races I've ever had, with three cars approaching finish from three different streets. Outwitting the enemies by taking another route. Gosh, this game is amazing.Also, awesome soundtrack ranging from Avril Lavigne to Guns n Roses and Claud Debussy. Great graphics and optimization.While some might say that the unlicensed cars are taking out the immersion, imo it adds to the feel of the imaginary Paradise City and are awesome.10/10 would bundle again			"

												When I first got a Playstation 3 this was one of the 1st games I got, and even til today this is my favorite game that I've ever played.  This game is the most fun I've had on a racer, and there's just so much content in here, with races, stunt runs, marked man races, the Road Rages, plus all the unlockable cars.The only negative I have, is that it appears that the ""Ultimate Box"" does not include all the DLC that was available on the Ps3, namely the expansion ""Big Surf Island"" or the Cops/Robbers pack. I don't know if the Legendary Cars are included either.  If not, I'm very disappointed in that, as I thought this ""Ultimate Box"" would actually have everything in it.I got this in a Humble Bundle, so I can't be too upset, plus it IS my favorite game ever, so I'm good.  Would just have loved to have Big Surf Island, as I love the Dune Buggy car.This is HIGHLY recommended.  So much fun, and this is one of the few games I'll play online.			"

												Burnout Paradise has to be the best racing game I have ever played. The city has lots of different events to do, cars to unlock and collectables to smash, find or jump. You start with one car and have to win races which puts a new car into the world and you must take it down to be able to drive it. The events include: Races, Road Rage (taking down other drivers,) Marked Man (like race but you have to survive instead of coming 1st,) Stunt Run (Do stunts for points) and Burning routes which have 1 per car and it's a point to point that you must beat the clock to get a new car (really just an upgrade to what you were driving.) All of this adds up to be an unique racing game with lots to keep you occupied. If my hours look low i managed 118hrs on xbox and did EVERYTHING.			"

I would recommend this game to anyone that likes racing or/and freeroaming. This game is really fun to play with friends online and i really like the fact that you can upgrade your license, which means you can then unlock better cars.9/10 Great Game!			"

												Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box добрался и до ПК в 2009 году,это была не очень грандиозная гонка по мнению геймеров(пока конечно в неё не поиграли).Игра действительно что-то с чем-то.Есть всё что когда-то не хватало в современных гонках,то есть свободной езды,красиво и реалистично разбивающиеся машины и очень классные спорт-кары.Основное действие игры происходит в Paradise City.Рай для гонщиков.Там нет людей,животных.Там есть дорога и аварии.Что бы получить машину,надо выйграть несколько гонок.А потом разбить выйграную машину,а потом забрать её на свалке и починить.И разъежать на ней по городу.В саундтреке присутствуют такие известные песни, как Guns N’ Roses — Paradise City; Twisted Sister — I Wanna Rock; Alice In Chains — Would?; Avril Lavigne — Girlfriend и Depeche Mode — Route 66, а также песни таких исполнителей как Jimmy Eat World, LCD Soundsystem, B'z, Seether, Killswitch Engage, Junkie XL, Airbourne, Agent Blue и Jane’s {LINK REMOVED}Addiction(Rutor.org)Ещё там присутствует мультиплеер.Можно ездить бандой друзей и крушить кучу тачек,главное не переусердствовать.Лучшая гонка в мире,всем советую.10\10			"

												This game is getting older as we speak. The game is a classic and is really the best Burnout game in the series, I love this game personally and can play it for hours with its multiple missions and many different cars. The cars in this game... Well I love them really, starting the cars driving them at high speeds through the city and the hills. There are many DLCs ,which you know I hate, but there is a definate way to bypass that. The cars are all interesting and really fun to drive, the handling is very easy and you can definatley feel the freedom when you're driving.Firstly the cars in this are awesome! You can get many styles of cars such as: Rage, stunt, street and that wierd turbo thing that only lets you recharge... The entire car system has many different styles of driving, the cars can be stock or the upgraded unlocked version of the original car. You can get mini cars, police cars and many more random types of new cars which can only be found on the origin store. The DLC for paradise island is only avalible for the console versions of this game but you can mod it into the game which adds buggys and a whole new island. The entire games map is massive compared to new games and its nicley detailed, the whole thing has events placed ""at every intersection"" as explained in the first part of the game which is true! Events on every intersection which can be played again but only to beat your score.The map concludes of beaches, mountains and city scapes with loads of driving to do. I had some technical problems with the game trying to set up multiplayer, EA actually sent me a copy onto my Origin account which then worked. The games multiplayer consists of free drive, races, stunt runs and free races (which is where you set up your own races for your friends). I like playing with my friends because you can have a lot of fun seeing who can get the biggest air alltogether in a certain place or just driving for fun. Multiplayer does have a negative side to it though, its very anoying to setup with multiple game platforms Steam/Origin but I was the only one with this problem.The game does have DLC but noone wants to pay for that so some nice modding community have recreated Paradise Island from the Xbox and Playstation games, the mod also allows you to change cars at random points and adds all of the DLC without EA coming to rip your wallet apart. The DLC is quite fun and you can have lots of random moments with your friends. The mod also allows you to change to any citizen car with any paint scheme which is a nice feature.Only problems that I had. On a Windows 7 Computer it worked fine for a series of time, it would crash ocasionally but that might of been because of my older setup. The game works well with old and new Windows but I had some problems with a Win10 machine, but my friends computer (WIN8) worked fine. I was trying to get the game running with two monitors but then I realised I my older setup was screen center to left which for some reason broke burnout completley but when I disconnected it, the game ran smoothly.You can have hours of fun on any burnout game but especially this one with its free world and ability to choose to do missions when you want to. So I recommend buying this, but remember to play it with friends because it is extremely fun messing around with some areas!			"

												Arcade to the Maaaaaaaaaaaaax!This time in Paradise City (open ""world"")As a great fan of the series, since Burnout 3 Takedown, I'm glad the Paradise Ultimate Box is available on PC/Steam. I also bought it on my 360 back in 2009 and with the controller support in the Steamversion its pretty much the same feeling so to speak. But of course the whole graphics looks much much better.Content stays the same except the Big Surf Island DLC, which is NOT available on PC :<Bikes, Mini Cars are in.Pros:+ variety of races+ many Cars, 3 main types of cars/boost (race, stunt, crash)+ bikes+ graphics, sound+ DJ + soundtrackCons:- No BSI DLC- No Trafficattack (as in Burnout Revenge)IMHO Paradise adds the openworld feature to its predecessor and almost exceeds your ""need for speed"" so to speak. This Game will definitely match your expectations as an Arcade and Burnoutfan.Just hit the Boost and get it on!			"

												This game is great fun, absolutely.But why call it the 'Ultimate Box' when it isn't an 'Ultimate Box'?Let me tell you, one of the main things I wanted to do in this game was get the DeLorean, but you can't, unless you buy a code cause the in-game store is closed, forever. You can't buy anything from the store, this is real $$$ by the way. That really let me down, this is just a game, not an 'Ultimate Box'. The game should come bundled with all the DLC for the game, not just have it installed and not be able to use it.So just letting you guys know, this is a great game that was made ages ago but disapointing without being able to purchase the DLC cars.So if your like me, and want the DLC cars, maybe buy a code before getting this, but if you just want the game, then by all means get it, it's worth it.At least Steam Refunds are a thing so I can get a refund if I can't get the Delorean and if I lose interest in this game, which I doubt.

												So good!!!  Still my favorite game of all time.  Open world racing, spectacular crashes, awesome soundtrack.  Vehicles: Cars handling is very arcade-y, but very fun.  There are a number of cars with twitchy handling that require more than just throttle mashing to win the races.  A Burning Route time trial event for each car unlocks a slightly upgraded version of that car.  The addition of motorcycles is a nice change of pace with their offline time trial events.Stunt Runs, Road Rages, Marked Man and Race events can be played online or offline.  In addition, there are hundreds of online challenges for 2-8 players.  When you find a good group of online players, it is a lot of fun.Showtime: Crash your way down the road racking up as many points as possible.  Destruction has never been more fun.Road Rules: Set a fast time for every road on the map.  You'll be cursing the traffic but that clean run is so sweet.Criterion, please take a break from Need for Speed and make another Burnout already.Sidenote:  I played this game all the way through to 102% on the PS3 in 2009 and just recently bought it for the PC.  It looks SO much better on the PC.			"

												Really love the idea of a racing game which leaves you with a bit more space than just a racetrack. The graphics are decent and the burnout game feeling is there (even though it's a PC version).I would suggest you plug a TV monitor and your xbox 360 controll in to your pc and hit the pedal om this one, because using a keyboard on a racing game is just to farging lame!

If you buy this, be ready to crash. In slow motion. all the time. Some decent music and a loud engine make up the soundtrack. You can stop any song from playing in the menu. The menu is a bit clunky.

												Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box добрался и до ПК в 2009 году,это была не очень грандиозная гонка по мнению геймеров(пока конечно в неё не поиграли).Игра действительно что-то с чем-то.Есть всё что когда-то не хватало в современных гонках,то есть свободной езды,красиво и реалистично разбивающиеся машины и очень классные спорт-кары.Основное действие игры происходит в Paradise City.Рай для гонщиков.Там нет людей,животных.Там есть дорога и аварии.Что бы получить машину,надо выйграть несколько гонок.А потом разбить выйграную машину,а потом забрать её на свалке и починить.И разъежать на ней по городу.В саундтреке присутствуют такие известные песни, как Guns N’ Roses — Paradise City; Twisted Sister — I Wanna Rock; Alice In Chains — Would?; Avril Lavigne — Girlfriend и Depeche Mode — Route 66, а также песни таких исполнителей как Jimmy Eat World, LCD Soundsystem, B'z, Seether, Killswitch Engage, Junkie XL, Airbourne, Agent Blue и Jane’s {LINK REMOVED}Addiction(Rutor.org)Ещё там присутствует мультиплеер.Можно ездить бандой друзей и крушить кучу тачек,главное не переусердствовать.Лучшая гонка в мире,всем советую.10\10			"

The online challenges requires a lot of teamwork but if you are playing with the right players, you'll achieve them fast.The soundtracks are pretty epic as, the city looks visually amazing.Too bad this game never got the Cops N' Robbers and Secret Island DLC's for PC.If you want to go to Paradise City, then pick this game as fast as you can. :DMy Rating: 9.5/10			"

												Burnout: Paradise has something for every type of gamer. If you just like the racing aspect, you got it. Do you just like showcasing cars in action? there's the stunt mode so you can take snapshots of your card in mid-air. Or you're like me and like crashing into ♥♥♥♥ and watching it tumble around, that's what road rage mode is for. Also, you can just activate this mode where your car suddenly starts flipping and the objective is to cause as much damage to other cars before you loose momentum.This game still plays as good as when it came out and hasn't felt any older. The world is so big, some people can still get lost in the middle of a heated race in multiplayer. The variety of cars is there and each one drives really differently. I would buy it now since it still has people playing it.			"

												Burnout Paradise is one of the best arcade racers you will ever play. The concept of the game is simple and fun. It can get a tad bit tedious if you play for too long by yourself. However, there are some party modes that can allow for some fun multiplayer action (only 1 controller needed). Not all of the DLC is included (1 or 2 fun but unncessary dlc) in the package for some reason. I think this is because EA was like ""f*** it.

												 Burnout Paradise is a game that has taken the open world elements that we have all loved from the past, along with a racing game tied into the formula. Not only does Burnout give players an open world, but uses a great way to unlock cars. There are many ways to unlock cars. From performing the same old race to driving down the highway to smash a rival that is in pursuit, Paradise is very edgy and also easy for players to level up and climb the ranks. Along with the open world and unlockable items, Burnout allows players to experience driving in a whole new level with a Slow-Motion camera designed to see crashes or takedowns in a whole new way. This feature actually makes crashing a little more rewarding (as weird as it sounds) than that of just completing a race. With a great Single-Player along with a fun Multiplayer  Burnout is a must have title in anybody's library. "

WARNING!!! I'll be comparing this game to ""Burnout Revenge""; it's predecessor.This is the last entry of the main Burnout series, and I feel that it is a strong game, it is really fun to play. But compared to the previous game... it fell short for me. Lemme explain:I used to play Burnout Revenge on my PS2 and I had a blast playing through it, I haven't played it in over 2 years but there are a lot of things missing in Paradise.1. Traffic Checking Sure in this game you can get ""Traffick Check Takedown"" which is crashing into a traffic car, causing it to lose control and crashing into an oponent... BUT in Revenge if you crashed into the back of a traffic car you could just launch it into oblivion (and possible other racers), in fact, traffic checking was actually a whole game mode in Revenge, where you had to crash into as many cars as possible before you ran out of time, by chaining them and throwing them into Trucks and Busses and oncoming traffic for bonus time and points.In Paradise you can't do it... which I learned the hard way...2. Crash Events Yes you can trigger a crash event by pressing LB+RB on your Xbox controller (not sure on keyboard) but they only serve as a ""record"" on the different roads of the game... in Revenge they were MASSIVE, you had to launch your car into a heavily transited intersection; you could unlock heavy cars for those events specifically, If you have played ""Turbo Dismount"" then you'll know how those worked on Revenge, except that once you did enough damage your boost meter would feel and you'd have to mash the boost button to BLOW UP and causing even more damage to other cars and even reach cars that were too far away from you. Beating those events would unlock more ranks, events and cars.3. Burnout TakedownsYou can't do these in Paradise... In Revenge (after you unlock the ability of course), when you crashed in a Road Rage or Race event you could press a button (Don't remember which one) and blow up, taking other racers with you, racking up your score in Road Rage, or diminish your dissadvantage after crashing.4. Double, Triple and more takedownsIn Paradise if you manage to force 2 or more racers into a wall and they all crash, you only get credit for one of those; in Revenge if you do that it would show you the first crash and say ""TAKEDOWN!"" and immediately shift to the other crashed car and say ""Double Takedown"" and even if you don't get the camera for the takedowns you still got credit for those... making Road Rage events a lot more satisfying to beat.5. AFTERTOUCHAftertouch is an ability in most Burnout games (At least on Burnout 3, Revenge, and Dominator) where if you crash into a wall or traffic car, you could slow down time and move your car in the air, this means you can place yourself in front of oponents for them to crash into you... AND IT COUNTS AS TAKEDOWNS, which meant that if you made a mistake you could take the competition with you!Unfortunately you can't use aftertouch in Paradise, If you crash you can actually spin if the front wheels are touching the ground... but even if you manage to position yourself in front of someone, it won't count as a takedown... sure it makes them crash and lose their advantage... but it feels a lot more satisfying to read ""AFTERTOUCH TAKEDOWN"" and even adding a DOUBLE or TRIPLE if you cause 2 or 3 oponents to crash into you. This also means that on Road Rage events you won't get credit for doing that.6. More CarsI like how you unlock cars by smashing them into a wall in Paradise. However in Revenge you were constantly unlocking new cars by getting medals in all of the events, however in Paradise it feels more of a chore to unlock them instead of a rewards...In fact I ALT+F4 out of the game multiple times because I couldn't reach the car I had to unlock and when I finally got close, I do a curve wrong or crash into traffic and completely lose the damn car... Also in Revenge there was a list of objectives in every location (I think there were 9 locations... not sure on that one) and they were pretty much the same, but they were really difficult to beat, The ones I remember the best are: Get a vertical takedown Win a clean race (No crashes) Beat X event in Y ammount of timeThere were more but those are the ones I remember and what do you get for beating all of the objectives?ONE OF THE BEST CARS IN THE GAMEIt was rewarding to beat them.7. Signature TakedownsI think even RIvals for the Nintendo DS had signature takedowns... if you crashed an oponent in a specific spot on an event you'll get multiple angles of the crash and ""pictures"" AND you'll unlock the signature takedown (actually quite useless but it still feels satisfying to know that you did it.)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now that I'm done comparing this one with Revenge I'll express my opinion on the new features the game has.1. Open WorldMeh... to be honest Burnout doesn't need an open world, it has always been about the events and races, but physically reaching each event doesn't really fit with the pace of this game.2. Stunt RunsThey're really fun, I like just jumping all over the place, drifting and finding shortcuts and stunt jumps on the way, And crashing against something finishing your combo feels fait, you crash? start the combo again.3. Time TrialsI don't like how you always have to change cars for these events, you know a little pop-up saying ""would you like to change your car?"" would be nice for these events, as junk yards are often far away and sometimes I forget which car was I supposed to get into... Although unlocking the improved version of the car feel good for the trouble.4. Gas, Paint and Repair stops The spray stops are ok, and having to repair the car first before experiencing their full potential feels... out of place for Burnout. And I only find Gas stations useful for free roam.What I don't like is that repair stops make the marked man and road rage events FAR TOO EASY...5. Marked Man eventsThey're challenging, I like that. You have to reach the end while you'll being chased by multiple enemies that are constantly shunting and ramming you to wreck you car, it's pretty much Road Rage but it is a race instead of racking up takedowns, BUT you can take those cars down to fill up your boost meter.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------So yeah I'll just put the pros and cons now...Pros Open World Tons of events Lots of cars Stunt jumps, billboards, shortcuts to find and complete. New event typesCons Unlocking cars feels more like a chore than a reward Less features compared to it's predecessor Old event types removed Repair shops make road rage events too easy.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall I recommend this game all the way, I bought it when it was on sale and I encourage you to do it aswell... but to be honest if you come across Burnout Revenge for the PS2/PS3/XBOX360 get that instead.

If this exact same game was made today it would be a 10 or 20 GB download, but since it was made back when programmers knew how to program code right, it's only a 2.9 GB Download and looks as good or better than current day racing games.

												So I have played alot of burnout on the first Xbox (not sure which version anymore) and had loads of fun playing it.That's why when I saw this game on sale for only €2,50 I instantly bought it.Pros- You're free to do what you want.- The music in the game is really good and if you don't like a song you can easily skip it.- Easy to learn.- Alot of different things to do.Cons- I don't really like the new crash system (called showtime in this game).- No windowed option in the game.- You need to login to a EA account (you can play offline without).- I have 7 hours in this game and until now I find it a bit too easy.Overall I really like this game and it was well worth my money, and I would recommend this to other people,Rating: 8/10			"

												Late to the party, my children and I installed this a year or two ago.  We all loved the Guns N Roses Paradise City intro.  We all loved the handling, the events, the world, the graphics, the cars, the constant carrot dangling in front of us.  I fired the game back up recently and noticed I wanted to do something, anything in the world in addition to just driving.  I couldn't get out of my car:)  I guess I wanted to play GTAV.  I think that Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box is one of the best racing games I've ever played, and because of this it gets a 9/10.  However, with the rise in the quality of open world games that contain vehicles these past few years (superior handling, tons of different types of drive modes and camera angles, etc.), I wonder what the future holds for racing games.

												In Paradise City, there was a box. Nobody knew what was is in it, nobody was ever able to open it. It had strange letters etched into it, letters which kept the mystery surrounding this box, nicknamed the ""Ultimate Box"", going for years. What are these letters, you may ask? DLC.In February 5th of 2009, humanity discovered a way to open this box. Simply by inserting money from your wallet or credit card into it's keyhole, for the first time people were able to do something nobody could ever do before; Play Burnout Paradise on the PC. With motorcycles. Following these events, video game megacorporation Electronic Arts claimed ownership of the Ultimate Box and began monopolizing it. However, if you are content with giving your money to the military industrial complex, take out your credit card and get ready to do something absolutely mind-bending. Get ready to play a pretty fun open-world driving game on your very own personal computational device. In 2400p. 120fps. Twin Titan Blacks SLI. Overclocked Pentium 3. Anime mods optional.			"

												Wow, I had such a great time with this game on the PS3. I played it for over 100 hours and it's still a great game ! The graphics were (are) amazing, and it reminded me a bit of Midtown Madness, another favorite of mine. There are no pedestrians in this game - I'd normally complain about this -  but there is just so much traffic and you're driving at such high speeds that you'll hardly ever notice there's not a person to be found in this game. There are a lot of cars. You can win them by finishing races or by crashing into them while driving around (which reminded me of Chase HQ, another excellent chasing game). The crashes look spec-ta-cu-lar and there's just so much to do ! Destroy billboards, crash into gates, win cars, win races, do stunts; you name it, it's there. One of the best (yes, the BEST !) racing games ever. Hoping for a sequel. Fingers crossed.[Rating: 90/100]			"

												This game always disturbed me a little when playing it. Mostly from one of the games core mechanics getting a new car. To get a new vehicle you most 1st unlock it into roaming mode, from their you must find this vehicle some-where in your world (which isn't to hard since its always the guy going 1 million MPH in the corner of your eye) and run the car off the road killing the drive. From there to get the car you go back to the junkyard where you keep all your cars to find it how you left it (totally totaled) and switch and go to repair it. Also there a Type of Car in this game that promotes driving your fellow competition off the road to gain Nitro for a speed boat (which isn’t that troubling but I had to mention anyway)Remember those little ""This is a game, Drive safely and wear a seat belt"" notices whenever you start up a “Need for Speed” game (disregarding the 1st games of the series). Well like “Need for Speed” this game is also publish by EA but HERE THE KICKER, “Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box” lacks this safety message completely (in anyway shape or form).All that time the public was worrying that “Need for Speed” will make their kids into driving lunatics (that’s why EA included that safety message in the 1st place), they were wrong“Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box” was the true monster, promoting players to murder other drivers by running them off the road to their deaths to claim there car latter in the junkyardAlso If your wondering about how good the game is in general.

												The best arcade racing game available for PC. Simple as that. I would rank this at number 3 in the Burnout franchise with Burnout: Revenge coming as number one and Burnout 3 coming second. The gameplay in this game gets really repetitive after you reach 50% of total progress but the rush never ends. Graphics and sound (AND the soundtrack) are very, very nice considering this is now 5 years old and it works without a hiccup on any modern PC (first time played it on a dual core Athlon X2 3000+ with 2GB RAM and a HD 4670 and it never ever slowed down), all settings maxed out. I would recommend this to anyone even remotely interested in racing games, it's worth every penny. I would give it 8.8/10.			"

												This is a game ive had for a while now, but I've only recently started playing a lot of. Its one of the most origininal driving games I think I've ever seen. It completly throws the generic 'standard circuit' racing convention and replaced it with an open city where you have to get from point A to B by choosing which roads to take while still driving your opponents into the ground (quite literally). The graphics side to this game are... ok but  if you stop your car for a moment and actually look around. the scenery seems less authentic and 2D (but you will get this in EVERY racing game becuase why the hell have you stopped your car to look at the scenery). The multiplayer in this is probably what makes it most interesting and fun. Mulitple different modes, not just racing but co-op challenges, sandbox mode A.K.A freeburn and all the other crazy stuff in between.8/10Deffinaltley one to buy especially if you have some friends to play online with you.

												It's some great old-school racing fun, with a ton of content for a very small price.You have an upgrade path with lots of cars in three main groups: speed, stunt and destruction. You collect these as you win races and challenges, both as rewards and as target which you have to take down in order to collect them.You can play offline with challenges from simple races, not-so-simple races, stunt challenges and races where you are the target for other cars who are trying to destroy your vehicle.You can also play online with friends and strangers, setting up races, simple ones or with multiple check points, car limits, boost limits or a free-for all. You will need a free EA/Origin account to play online and to add friends to your friends list requires installing Origin.There are some annoying quirks (the UI navigation involves ESC, F1, F2 and Backspace!) and the theme song that plays every time you launch the game (To stop it: Go to Steam\steamapps\common\Burnout(TM) Paradise The Ultimate Box\SOUND\STREAMS and replace the file GUNS_AND_ROSES.SNS with a blank text file of the same name (including extension)) and there's this blank page that pops up requiring you to hit ""Return to Game"" every so often in the menu (The fix to that is to add  127.0.0.1 portal.burnoutweb.ea.com to your hosts file). I guess that's some hangover they forgot to fix when they stopped supporting whatever was on that page, but once you've done that, it's plain sailing.It's a good little game!			"

												The game that's on top of my racing game list. This is just so brilliant game where you have an open world even during races! That's something that I like quite a lot. There are bunch of different events, all of them fun. I like Road Rage the most though. It's so enjoyable to just smash into other racer's cars to get a neat takedown. Everything in this game is just so enjoyable and fun.Cars you unlock with amount of wins you have and via completing a car's Burning Route, which is basically a race alone with a time limit. The cars are different. Not just the looks and speed, but also boost ""strength"" and car durability. Last one is quite important for Marked Man (event where you got to race to the finish without other ""racers"" totaling your car too many times) and Road Rage. The cars all handle differently too.All in all, if you like racing games even a tiny bit, you'll most likely like this one quite a lot. Did I say that the music is great, too?Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												Because this game has Avril Lavigne's Girlfriend in this game OST, I consider this game's soundtrack a good one.The game's mechanics and everything else in the game are very well done and the game is a unique racing experience, compared to most other games I've played.Trust me, this game is a ♥♥♥♥ing great one and I recommend you buy it as soon as you can. It's totally worth the £5 or less if it goes on sale.Here's an extra screenshot for the Avril Lavigne fans:

												Burnout Paradise is quite possibly both the best driving game I've ever played and the most FRUSTRATING driving game I've ever played. Rather than a series of isolated race courses separated by menus, Burnout Paradise drops you into Paradise City and says ""go nuts"". The city's archetecture and layout is fantastic, with hundreds of ""secret"" pathways marked by large yellow fences and super jump ramps that can lead to fantastic shortcuts, Paradise City is a wonderful place to explore or simply drive around in. There are even a few carefully-hidden open areas like the old quarry or the stock car race track. I found driving around Paradise City to be a pleasant and even soothing experience at times.The core of the game's progression revolves around completing a series of events to improve your license grade. There are five categories of event, which range from races and time trials to stunt challenges and demolition derbys. Access to these events is spaced out across Paradise City at road intersections, although this creates a slight bias towards events starting in the more densely-built Eastern half of the game world.The driving mechanics are simple enough for a driving game novice like myself to grasp; there is no manual gear change, although I find that handbrake turns are exceedingly difficult to pull off, as it appears very hard to gauge whether a simple button press will cause you to turn slightly or perform a donut. However, the feeling of speed made available to the player is exhilerating, especailly asthe city's layout is seemingly purpose-built to allow speeding from point A to B.The DIFFICULTY in this game, however, is a severe black mark against it. Although it is not explicitly mentioned in-game, as  your license ranks up, your car becomes more difficult to drive, and the game's physics become increasingly erratic over what will and will not cause your car to veer wildly out of control and crash. Cars often seem to have MORE momentum after point of impact, rather than less, and I have even noticed a vast increase in speed when grinding against roadside barriers. Paradise City's traffic can leave the outcome of a race hinging on whether or not a car just -happens- to come out onto a crossing as you are passing by. Furthermore, the game has perculiar standards on what objects can be broken and which cannot. Street lights and some metal fences cause no impediment at all, while many other fences, along with trees and concrete bollards joined by chains, are completely immovable.At the same time, the AI cars are a mixed bag. Although one of the game's selling points is the freedom to travel however you like to reach a race's finish line, the route the AI takes is invariably the most efficient one, barring the use of shortcuts (which the AI almost NEVER uses), which often don't make much of a difference anyway. The AI racers are capable of tremendous acceleration from a standing start, outstripping ANY car you manage to unlock, yet have been known to commit suicide by slamming into walls and other cars. The only instance of the AI cars ""cheating"" in the player's favour is their tendency to teleport to behind the player in the ""Road Rage"" events, thereby making sure they are always nearby for you to run them off the road, no matter where you go.In terms of visuals, Paradise City is beautiful. The game has a customisable day/night cycle, although the only weather effect I've whitnessed is the occasional fog. AI cars and traffic have their head and tail lights on at all times, allowing you to see what else is on the road ahead, and the game treats you to a slow-motion camera when you crash, with a wealth of detail dedicated to cracking of glass and crumpling of metal. There is a large variety of cars for you to unlock, each one with customisable paint jobs, although these are often restricted to a choice of two colours and three finishes per vehicle. Cars' appearances change as they sustain damage, although no car has any set ""health"" meter, and any impact that does not cause you to crash leaves only cosmetic damage.The sound design is excellent, with many of the different cars having their own distinct engine sound, pleasantly rising in pitch as they near top speed. The sounds effects for crashing are visceral, with loud, sickening ""crunch"" sounds as metal crumples under force of impact. The game's music is a varied mix of classic rock tunes, music from past Burnout games and even classical music available on the game's radio, interspered with in-game advice from DJ Atomica, the only speaking, named NPC in the game.In terms of playstyle, three different car ""types"" are available; Stunt, Aggression and Speed. However, in my experience, Speed Cars are perhaps the least useful overall, as they tend to sacrifice durability for speed, which doesn't really help in traffic-heavy areas, and can only use their boost when the meter is full. The other two car types, while not necessarily as fast, grant open access to their boost functions, and are often sturdy enough to play rough with other racers, especially so in the case of Aggression cars. I limit my use of Speed cars to their specific time trial events and little else.In addition to cars, there are also a total of four motorcycles available to drive. These are slower, but offer much greater handling and more responsive steering. They also have their own separate license and events, which are all a series of time trials with actually quite generous time limits. The motorcycles are also, strangely enough, just as sturdy as the cars are, which can make for some rather amusing bike-to-car impacts that barely even slow you down.The game's user interface is passable, although I am annoyed that it takes cycling through a series of menus before you can exit the game. Furthermore, there is no option to reset an event and start over, short of quitting the event and then manually travelling back to the starting point. The closest the game gets to a quick reset is quitting out to the main menu, then re-entering the game, which returns you to the last junkyard (car selection structure) you visited. And since some of the events have you travelling all the way across Paradise City, this is a feature that is sorely lacking.Multiplayer still exists, but it is player-hosted, with EA no longer providing dedicated servers. However, this does not stop the game from requiring all players to have a working EA games account, which must be logged into as the game boots up. The game then attempts to connect to the servers that no  longer exist, leading to a blank white screen and a single button in the corner marked ""back to game"", which lets you continue.My experience with the online multiplayer is limited, but from what I can gather a hosted server can support up to eight players (possibly more, I cannot say), with the host having the authority to set up a variety of events much like the single-player challenges.Due to the lack of online support, the game's DLC vehicles are no longer purchaseable, although said DLC actually exists in the game files, and there is apparently a workaround available on the ""PC Gaming Wiki"" that allows players to access this DLC for free.Despite my severe frustrations with the game's difficulty, I still find Burnout Paradise to be fun racing sandbox. If you would be content with a limited selection of cars and events, you could avoid ranking up and play around a Paradise City with more forgiving physics, but if you are intent on progression and unlocking everything, then you will have to accept the game's often erratic and unfair difficulty as part and parcel of the experience.Recommended, if on sale, although it is only £5 GBP at full price.To summarise; fun, but frustrating,			"

												I once played this game when I was younger, and since I bought it for my PC, I have had so much fun re-living my childhood experience of playing this game. Sometimes it's fun to just drive around and explore the map, trying to do all of the super jumps. Sometimes it's fun to do races to try and get cars. It adds the idea of free roaming with the idea of a storyline, except the only quest is to get your license grade up.			"

												Burnout Paradise was a surprise for me. And a good one at that. bought it for around a dollar, didn't expect alot from the game, but what i found was one of the most enjoyable racing experiences i have ever had, up there with need for speed most wanted 2005. The physics in the game are really well made, and the chrashes are as cinematic as it gets, for one of the first times i actually enjoyed crashing my cars, so i could see it getting smashed in slow motion. Crashing was never so fun. The biggest problem in the game for me is that there's one waypoint system of any sort, even while you're racing, sometimes you will get lost or take a wrong turn just to find out that the road you're taking won't lead to the finsih line, but once you get used to the city, you will know it as you know the palm of your hand. Burnout paradise is deffinerely worth picking up because the amount of fun to be had here is insane. I also want to point out how good the soundtrack is, and if you're a rock fan, these words will be enough for you : They axctually have a guns n' roses track in this game.

												I'll be completely honest here, I installed this with pretty low hopes. I've seen what Criterion have done to the NFS franchise, which wasn't exactly stellar but it was fun, and figured they'd done more of the same with the Burnout series. But I am really enjoying this so far. The driving is direct and responsive, taking down an aggro car with a speed car is super satisfying too, that slow mo crash gives you that much loved moment of smugness. Graphically it's quite pretty for its year and it runs really well even on low end machines. So in summation, it's a damn fun game, the shelf life to cost ratio is damn high too. I'd recommend this game to anyone that enjoys racing games and those that enjoy a good hit and run, arcade style racer too.			"

												Burnout is my favorite racing franchise of all time, I've played the previous titles and loved them to bits. Quite literally. I was always astounded at how beautiful (ironically) crashes in the game can be. The crash physics are wonderful and smashing into cars in road rage is a very pleasant feeling to me. The cars in the game are for the most part, unique and handle differently. Some cars cannot turn fast, forcing you to use the handbrake at sharp corners, and there are some cars that slip and slide everywhere, making it easy to swerve into oncoming traffic, but can drift without issues at sharp turns. The drifting in this game feels amazing; especially when you're driving real fast in a race late in the game when you get the really fast cars.There are 5 different race types in this game: Race, Road Rage, Stunt Run, Marked Man, and Burning Route all of which are special in their own way. Races (AKA: Point A to Point B) always make you feel like you're going fast, and doing multiple burnout chains is satisfying. Stunt runs are what they are implied to be, just jump off ramps, boost, and drift to rack up points (these are my least favorite). Road Rage is basically a timed, fast paced demolition derby, and holy crap, it is awesome! Just wreck other drivers and reach the takedown score to win. Marked Man is a bit of a spin on Races and Road Rage. In Marked Man you have to race from point A to point B. The catch is there are drivers trying to prevent you from reaching your target by smashing your car, survive till the finish and you win. Burning Routes are probably the simplest to grasp, just make it to the finish in time and win an upgraded version of the car you're using. The core game is fantastic in and of itself, however I think it would be best for everyone if I mention how well the online portion of the game is. Freeburn online is a very enjoyable experience if the host actually makes the experience fun for everybody. What I mean is when you're playing online the host can make events that everyone can participate in, and these while limited are very enjoyable when alot of players partcipate. Marked man online is so much more thrilling than offline in my opinion, especially when there are 7 players trying their best to take you down. There are loads of challenges that the players can particpate in, and the challenges change with the amount of players, so there's always something to do.(As far as I know, you can't join a friend's server via steam, you have to it from in game, via the search option.)The thing to watch out for is that this game does NOT come with all the DLC. ""The Ultimate Box"" just gives you access to two online only cars, that don't even have boost. It also gives you party mode, which is useless to anyone, unless they share the computer with a friend; it's kind of like pass the controller. A mode with bikes, which is completely seperated than the cars, they have their own races. I heartily recommend Burnout Paradise to anyone who loves a good racing game, with great crash physics and a fun online mode. "

GraphicsWell detailed game. You can read (albeit dangerous) the license plates on other cars. The lighting from the sun shines off high gloss paint jobs like in real life. The small detail damages are realistic; if you broke a headlamp it stays broken and doesn’t light up. The back ground is realistic enough to tell distance. I’ve played this at both regular television and hi definition 1080p while it is still good at the lowest setting I highly recommend the playing at the highest possible detail.Sound and MusicYou can tell from just driving around what types of cars are around you with even having to look at that area. The screeching of the tires to the roar of an engine is clear with any vehicle you use. Now the music, quantity or quality wise you will not be disappointed. There are a lot of songs that play while driving around so chances are if you play for an hour or two, you will not hear the same song twice. And you don’t like a particular song you can always take if off the play list. One should note that a good portion of songs are the same songs from older Burnout Games.Game PlayAs you win events you upgrade your license. The higher the license, the larger amount of vehicles you will be able to use. These events are littered all thought Paradise City. To start the event simple pull up to a light to start it.Here is the events.Races: Standard Race. From one to seven other opponents you drive to a specific end point.Road Rage: Timed Event. You use your vehicle as a battering ram to smash other vehicles into traffic, walls or other hard objects. Target amount is usually displayed. Event ends when either you take to much damage or time ends.Marked Man: Almost like a race. You goal is to reach one destination while four other computer cars try to inflict enough damage to keep you from reaching your destination.Stunts: Use your vehicle like a little acrobat, jumping off ramps, crashing bill boards and doing spins. The more you do in a sequence the more points you get. There is a target score to get per event.Burning Route: One route per vehicle. It’s a timed race where you just have to get to the finish line by a certain time using a certain vehicle. Every route you finish unlocks a upgraded version of the vehicle used.All these events get a bit more difficult as the game wears on but not that much more. I would say once you get used to the way the game plays you find that most of these events range from easy (one or two attempts) to medium (fifteen minutes maximum).Now there are a few side events or tasks that are fun to do. Running certain billboards, barriers, and super jumps. They are littered everywhere, cant be avoided just driving around. There are few hidden but find to fun all of them and as a reward for finding all it unlocks more vehicles. There are also two events per street, one is time trails and the other is showtime. Showtime is just you bouncing around hitting vehicles for points.Online play is quite fun with tasks and races, connections are usually stable. One thing I like is with Xbox Live Vision take a photo of you when you get taken out by another drive and sent to the aggressor. The online experience is a whole new game in itself and worth playing.NegativesAlthough it’s a very good game here is a few of the things I didn’t like. Showtime is very repetitive in the sense you have to do it to all 64 streets of Paradise City. Also Showtime replaced Crash from previous games. The on line challenges are very repetitive where if 2 players you have to do it for 7 players. And some of them are very very basic like driving in oncoming traffic. Also while doing online challenges if one person get disconnected, the challenges are cancelled. The difficulty level is somewhat misleading as the more cars you unlock the easier the game is when trying to do the events.One last thing that kind of surprised me is the amount of advertising in the game, from billboards to vans there is way too much advertising in this game. To show how much advertising there are four unlockable cars, all of them are plastered with the names.			"

												I'll be completely honest here, I installed this with pretty low hopes. I've seen what Criterion have done to the NFS franchise, which wasn't exactly stellar but it was fun, and figured they'd done more of the same with the Burnout series. But I am really enjoying this so far. The driving is direct and responsive, taking down an aggro car with a speed car is super satisfying too, that slow mo crash gives you that much loved moment of smugness. Graphically it's quite pretty for its year and it runs really well even on low end machines. So in summation, it's a damn fun game, the shelf life to cost ratio is damn high too. I'd recommend this game to anyone that enjoys racing games and those that enjoy a good hit and run, arcade style racer too.			"

Já estamos falando de um ""Clássico"" que felizmente voltou a ser jogável (e Online) no PC!Longa Históra, mas depois de um Update da Origin mesmo com o jogo instalado totalmente pela Steam(?) foi recuperado um Save que aparentemente estava perdido para sempre, assim como a possibilidade de se jogar Online, e funciona! Servidores melhores que de alguns jogos mais novos da EA!Burnout Paradise em Si é um excelente Arcade Racing Game, que diverte MUITO com seus gráficos, carros, trilha sonora e jogabilidade caracteristicos, em época de Promoção é encontrado a 5 Reais, o que na minha humilde opinião, com o atual estado do jogo, o torna imprescindível para fãs de corrida!

												Burnout Paradise was a surprise for me. And a good one at that. bought it for around a dollar, didn't expect alot from the game, but what i found was one of the most enjoyable racing experiences i have ever had, up there with need for speed most wanted 2005. The physics in the game are really well made, and the chrashes are as cinematic as it gets, for one of the first times i actually enjoyed crashing my cars, so i could see it getting smashed in slow motion. Crashing was never so fun. The biggest problem in the game for me is that there's one waypoint system of any sort, even while you're racing, sometimes you will get lost or take a wrong turn just to find out that the road you're taking won't lead to the finsih line, but once you get used to the city, you will know it as you know the palm of your hand. Burnout paradise is deffinerely worth picking up because the amount of fun to be had here is insane. I also want to point out how good the soundtrack is, and if you're a rock fan, these words will be enough for you : They axctually have a guns n' roses track in this game. I think thats nuff said.TL;DR JUST BUY IT NOW			"

												A good racing game in my opinion. Its fast paced, with slow-mo crashes, jumps, side swiping, drifting and awesome looking cars. You can sink a lot of time into this game, but by the time you unlock the fastest car, you'll be tired of this game. The races leave something to be desired, because the racing AI is really predicatable and quite slow making races really easy. I probably lost five offline races out of 140+ races. Most of the fun I had in this game was driving around in freeroam, drifting, finding cool jumps and trying to unlock every car and its upgraded counterpart.

												I'm not really a fan of racing games... but Burnout is something that I really like and enjoy. Around the fictional setting of Paradise City cars are meant to be smashed, shortcuts and super jumps discovered, and multiple routes toward the same finish line exploited. Winning challenges nets you new rides and better licenses to take on more difficult challenges. The city itself isn't a metropolis teeming with life--you won't see pedestrians wandering around or anything like that--but there's plenty of traffic on the roads and shortcuts to discover as you freely drive around. While in the confines of your car you can pull up at stoplights to trigger events of different types, like stunt challenges, races, marked man (reach a finish line while other drivers try to smash you to bits) and road rage (destroy a set number of cars within a time limit) events, as well as timed runs. The soundtrack is really nice because it suits the atmosphere of the game. What could possibly be better than speeding down the highway through the thick traffic while being chased by 3 heavily armored vehicles and listening to some classic music. The game has a pretty big and nice collection of classic tracks that I enjoy most. Anyway, if you're not really into racing games, but you do want to play something like that - Burnout it is.10/10 "

												I don't know what to say about this, it was half good and half bad but I can't pick the ""IDK"" rating to this. I liked the soundtrack, quality and cars on this game. My dislikes are bikes, crappy controls at the start (I wouldn't have problems if I changed them to Valve-like later. Oh and, after a few tries it's not a bad thing), takes too long to get into my destination and I don't even know where to go and I screw up (but then I realized there's ""Easydrive""), I can't hear a such THING when I have every sound level the highest of my game (I don't want to have more than 10% volume, because then I would be ear-♥♥♥♥♥ by a Microphone beep/voices or Steam message/online sounds. But then it's normal...) and no crashbreaker on Showtime or it's not like a Crash mode anyways. The showtime is like the recent game ""Burnout CRASH!"" with infinite Aftertouch function instead of Crashbreaker and it ends only when you run out of boost and your car stops. Also why are the records so impressive (minimum a million dollars) on this mode?Another problem is that unfortunately Electronic Arts has abandoned the in-game Burnout Store, which makes it impossible to buy the rest of this game's DLC (Cops and Robbers, Toys, etc.) unless someone knows how to use Amazon. They are still purchasable on Xbox 360 however.There's also a DJ guy that talks random ♥♥♥♥ between music tracks and tells the objective of many races/events, just like in Burnout 3, except this is totally not our beloved Stryker but that ♥♥♥♥er named ""DJ Atomika"" from the SSX series. Didn't you know that Stryker already has a job as a DJ for KROQ-FM and he was sent to EA Studios as a guest for just one time? It's not like he's gonna be a Crash FM DJ for every single game for the Burnout series, but still, he was the best in my opinion.Don't know about you, but it personally looks like Rockstar Games' Midnight Club with a few of Need for Speed's functions slapped on. Overall 6.4/10. Although earlier I was like a ""♥♥♥ ZOMFG DIS GAEM IZ ♥♥♥♥♥ -1/10 MAEK BORNOWT TREE ON STIM!!11"" guy, but then it was my first time playing...			"

												Still the best racing game ever!Critereon Games single-handedly deliver the fastest, most intense racing thrills in gaming, and Burnout Paradise remains their greatest installment. The sense of speed is riveting, and each vehicle has a distinct, believable handling that allows for strategic use for the vast array of events. The visuals are still nice, though the car models look FAR better than the admittedly dull and flat environments. It's not a demanding title, either, as I am playing on an Asus laptop with a dual-core i7 Skylake, 12GB ram, and a measly Nvidia 940M with 2GB DDR3 VRAM, and the only settting I need to dial back is ambient occlusion. If there is one complaint I have it's that the soundtrack is awful. Truly awful. But the crashes are sick, so I'm a happy camper. 9.5/10			"

												""Take me down To the Paradise City where the sign is green and the cars are pretty. I want you please, take me home!""(The play hours are low because this is my second purchase of the game after my first physical copy was broken [and the last installed game were removed long time ago] and I felt I wanted to be a bit nostalgic after I saw the Steam discount).So, Burnout Paradise is essentially a Burnout game, but with open world areas that become an ultimate playground of destruction. I essentially love this games and I wanna describe it in some form of pros and cons:Pros:- OPEN WORLD, BABY! This is what many Burnout fans wanted for a long time!- Vehicles variety. Besides a bunch of muscle cars, sports cars, super cars, and track cars, there are many everyday cars to choose from. You want to drive a sedan? You got it! Want to fool around in a van? There, have some awesome van! Want to haul your family in a station wagon? We got that for you!- Rewarding activities. Besides racing, road rage, stunt run, burning routes, and marked man, you can have plenty of side activities that sure are rewarding! form smashing billboards and gates, stunt jump, beating record time on certain streets, and also, my favourite, showtime! Which will be explained on the next point.- SHOWTIME! It's basically a good ol' crash event since Burnout 3, but there are no Crashbreaker. You use your boost to lift your car and move it around. Hitting traffic will refill your boost, and the best part is? YOU CAN ACTUALLY HAVE UNLIMITED SPACE TO DO YOUR SHOWTIME! You can basically start a Showtime at E. Crawford Dr. and end up with your boost tank empty at the South Bay Expressway, which is from north point of Paradise to the south point of it!- Diverse driving physics. Every cars in the game handles differently, which is a plus point for added realism. For example, when you drive the Carson 500GT, The car handles very slippery and each time you gas it, the rear tire will turn vigorously. But, when you drive cars like Carson Grand Marais, it handles like a boat. Hard to steer, and require e-brake to turn it sharply.- Day and night cycle. YES! There's finally a day and night cycle for thhis game, and it's a plus point for it!Cons:- Racing. What is lacking from the racing segment of the game is that you can only have point-to-point race in this game, There is no circuit mode which I kinda missed from the previous Burnout game.- Paintjob. Ugh. I pretty much dislike paintjobs on certain cars in the game. Wish there is an option to choose ""no-paintjob"" in certain vehicles.- Traffic variety. Many of us know that there were semi truck, industrial trucks, and RVs in the game. But unfortunately, these were cut content, and it's a shame that they were cut them. It adds plenty of realism if those were added (and also adds plenty vehicles to wreck in Showtime mode).Overall, it's a great game, alhough there are some lackings, but those are covered with the pros that given.

												The Utimate Box is a lie. There's clearly DLC installed that is hidden behind a paywall. This is terrible in and of itself. But, to add insult to injury you dannot buy the DLC as the burnout store is unavailible. So the game taunts you with content that is installed, but not accessable. And a lot of it looks really cool.The gameplay is fun. It is a fun experience. But, the fact theat the DLC isn't included in the ""ultimate"" experience, and that it is flat out unobtainable is beyond silly.			"

												I got so many mixed feelings about this game.I love racing games but I kinda hate it if they turn out to be a chore to finish them..I'll be short and simple on this.pros:-Very nice set of cars.-Great physics and animations.-Some times the car damage after crashes is impressive and the crash effects are very cool -Couple of nice mechanisms including auto repair and auto nitro-fill stations during races-Free roam map-Graphics are totally ok for its time of release.-Nice music selections.cons:-The way the races are set on the map; totally like a NFS Underground 2 ripoff -Annoyingly repetitive; once you level up during the game you got to re-run 90% of the races on the map with just a +10% of extra new race points all over.-Hard to get through if you are not too good with racing games; constant random traffic that makes you wreck your car way to easy even if you are 5 meters away from finish.-Respawn, cut scene, crash cinematics cannot be skipped, you lose like more than 5% of your gameplay time for no reason.-They totally ruin the fun of the game with the whole aggresive racing idea; i got more stressed than mentally rewarded after playing this.average:it's worth playing, the price is low anyway and you can get it cheaper during special offers. don't keep your expectations too high and enjoy the ride. don't buy this unless you are a hardcore racing games fanatic.

												One of the better racing games I've played on steam, despite some serious flaws.What it is:- All races played in the overworld- Traffic is present- No car upgrades, customization, or tuning- Car handling is arcade, not simulation- Several game modes, but only two (race and stunt) are worth playing- Most time is spent driving, not in menus- Exploration and finding secret sortcuts plays a big partCons:- Unskippable crash cam gets very annoying very quickly- No way to instantly restart a race. If you want to retry a race YOU MUST DRIVE BACK TO THE STARTING LINE.- Repairing your car or switching cars between races requires driving to a repair shop or junkyard, which is extremely tedious.- The menus are incredibly unintuitive (I had to google search to figure out how to quit the game and how to quit an event)Pros:- Exploration and finding secrets is really rewarding- The stunts are just awesome- Car handling is good- It is fun, despite the cons.

												The gameplay is incredibly arcady. It's nothing like other racing games. It's really fun cruising around with your buddy around Paradise city but other than that the game didn't really hold on to me. I guess some people may enjoy it but I think that it isn't actually an amazing game. It's more of a game you play when you don't have nothing better to do and you've got time to waste. If you like arcady driving controls then this is a must get, if you are a fan of need for speed or forza or grand turismo first try this game before buying it. It's not really for everyone. And if you decide to play it don't judge it rashly, because the driving is really diffrent then in other games, you gotta let it sink in. Oh and graphicly this game being that it's from 2009 is bloody amazing.TL;DR: If you don't like arcade racing games don't get it but try it, if you like arcade racing games get it. NOW!			"

												Honestly, I just find this game boring. It's not challenging. ""Here's a race, just drive down this straight road. Oh, great, you've done it! Here's a new car!"" Seriously? Even with a B-licence greatest challenge is not to miss a road during a race, which happens way too easy, because the mini-map doesn't rotate in your driving-direction. But even when you take the wrong exit you can still win the race, because your opponents are pretty slow. So just drive on, if you get totally lost, there's a way to restart the race anyway. Even though you can't win anymore (2nd place doesn't count), you have to finish. Then drive back and start again. The open-world-A-to-B-races just make you take the easiest (straight) road again and again. Because they work. Looking for a cool shortcut? Trying another route? Way to risky. Trying to break through a wooden fence may be succesfull... or end in a boring, unskippable slow-mo-crash-sequence. And not every crossing on the map is really one, because the road-height-levels aren't displayed.There are good things about this game. The world is nice, many things to ""collect"", great soundtrack. But for me there was nothing motivating.  I tried several times to find something. Something challenging. Mostly I left the game after about 30 minutes, because I couldn't find it. I guess I'll go back to NFS Most Wanted (2005) again...			"

												So I should start out with saying something nice. My three year old absolutely adores this game, and consequently we've played it quite a lot. This is his first experience with the series, it may well be my last. He has no concept of how many aspects of the series were sacrificed in the insane pursuit of an 'open-world' approach to racing games. He will perhaps never grasp how hollow every aspect of the game now appears in the light of a proceedurally-based sunrise, from the crashes, to the super jumps, to the minor variations on 3 routes that win all the races, to the billboards the game begs you to smash, defiling it's own logo OVER and OVER and OVER, as if the developers were working through some emotional issues. If the obvious cover-up done on the Van's paintjob is any indication, it was a cukolding experience for them. Oh, Criterion, remember when you were making Burnout 2 and Black? What led you to blue barrels and yellow construction signs acting as surrogate blues clues for toddlers?In any case, by 'Ultimate Box' what EA meant to say was ""Box full of DLC for you to pay for"", as this content isn't even Downloaded, it came with the game, you just have to pay to use it. That's right, there are several packages of cars just waiting to be unlocked for extra money, including the hovercraft delorean which makes every other car in the game seem lame. Oh wait, it's not actually a delorean, because EA had to slavishly rip off a bunch of brands without accrediting them. The car that looks like a Bel-Air has freakish air-time, making it the only candidate for completion of several achievements/unlocks. And they put motorcycles in this game, probably to taunt you with how much you can taste an awesome Road Rash remake, but rest assured it's completely neutered, uninspired, and honestly looks like they just walked away before they got anywhere with that particular aspect of the game.

												This game is incredible. It really is. I remember playing Burnout Paradise on early summer mornings and late nights. There's so much content packed in the game. I completed every single events and challenges, collected every car on PS3. And than I relaised that I can play it online. God, great times were had. Meeting, talking, racing, having fun with random players who eventually became your friends. The soundtrack is amazing, the gameplay is fluent even with keyboard, although a controller is highly recommended. The graphics look great even by today's standards. It's really hard to put your thoughts into words when you love a game. 10 out of 10, BUY IT, PLAY IT! It's a must play and have!			"

												Racing is my favorite sport, and my favorite genre of games, hands down. If you are looking for a simulation racing experience, this is without a doubt NOT the game for you. However, this is one of the most fun arcade-style racing experiences I have ever had. The crash physics are some of the best ever seen to this very day, the racing is intense and challenging, there are plenty of small missions to do all around Paradise City, and the cars (while heavily inspired by actual vehicles) are all pretty unique in their own way. Not to mention that it can run on just about any PC made after 2005. If you want a fun, crazy, and simple racing game, this is a must have.			"

												Preface: the game is perfectly enjoyable on its own merits. You should know, however, that it takes place in a post-apocalyptic world in which the human race has been utterly eradicated by a race of sentient vehicles who now freely roam the streets and occasionally rally terrifying black-clad death squads to murder each other for no apparent reason. They also have inexplicably created an awkward computer program (robot?) responsible for maintaining a lurid facade of human culture through insipid daily radio broadcasts to nobody in particular--perhaps to subconsciously placate the few remaining humans they have trapped in stasis for unanticipated future exploitation? The developers have sold themselves short by failing to highlight these key plot points in the game's summary.I challenge anybody to observe the complete lack of pedestrians, the fact that none of the cars have drivers, and the radio announcer's bizarre sense of humor and delivery style, and come to any other conclusion about this game's backstory. Driving through this environment is subtly unnerving after a while, evoking a sensation similar to observing desiccated corpses on Miranda and trying to figure out what the hell happened here. 11/10, would play again.

												This is a pretty good car and motorcycle driving game that allows you total freedom to go wherever you want in the huge world of Paradise City. And you don't have to do the challenges until you want to (completing challenges unlocks more vehicles). Although the game does have some MAJOR flaws (some of which are just plain stupid and should have been changed/fixed). There is no speedometer at all. You can't listen to your own music files on your computer while playing the game unless you run your own media player in the background. If you're playing online and your framerate gets too low, the game automatically kicks you from the server (even if it's your own server that you're hosting). Yes, you can get kicked from your own server if your framerate gets too low. There is no in game text chatting. You have to use a mic to communicate with other players on a server. As you upgrade your license, the races get MUCH harder because the AI will very often put cars right in front of you which are almost guaranteed to make you crash over and over. If you go too fast, you are very likely to crash over and over. If you take your time, it can be hard to get to first place. So it's a pretty good game, but with some MAJOR flaws. This game has given me an idea as to why EA was voted the world's worst video game company multiple times. Because of this game's MAJOR flaws, I don't recommend it			"

												What a piece of ♥♥♥♥ game. ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. Avoid at all costs unless you like Guns and Roses Paradise City over and over. Like annoying cut scenes you can't skip? Like the attentio of detail of having no driver in your car nor pedestrians? This game is for you!Can't connect to multiplayer because the ""Server is currnetly unavailable"" although my friends can play it without me.EA took the name of Burnout and pumped out this lazy piece of ♥♥♥♥ title. It's truly a shame. Once again avoid at all costs. It wasn't even worth the $0.50 I paid for it in the Humble Bundle.			"

												Forget all the other parts...this is the true Burnout.I have played this game more then i ever thought i'd play it and still i love to start it up to do some mindless racing.If you like the easiest arcade racing game in the world and mix it up with a city that has more shortcuts then roads you will adore this game...quite chalenging in the end as well. One tip for if you have visibility issues...set the time to day.For those who know the game Rush on the Nintendo.... this is what comes out if you make it have a baby with GTA.Personally i hate the whole DLC thing in games but in all honesty...this game is kinda complete without any of that.

												The open world killed the serie for me. It's not about shortcuts, crashes and take down anymore. It's about pausing the game every 10 sec to look at the map. Plus the minimap doesn't rotate so you end up going the wrong way and losing the race. Then you have to drive back to the start of the race because it's an open world game and you can't just hit restart to restart the race. Same thing when you want to change car. You have to drive to one of the junkyard. I wish there was a ""fast travel"" thing.Driving and jumping around in the city is fun thought. And the music is great.It's a shame they went the open world way. Burnout 3 was so much fun.If you you're looking for something like Burnout 3, I suggest you pick up Need For Speed Hot Pursuit. It's made by Criterion and it kinda feels like burnout 3 (minus the crashes).			"

												Ah, burnout, one of my favorite game series as a kid. Unfortunately, this is the last one made and I doubt there will be any more burnout games after this, onto the point...I have played through this game twice or close to it before aquiring a steam copy. Gameplay and Mechanic wise it resembles almost every other burnout game before it, with some new features and a new GFX engine. The main difference between all the other burnouts though, is that this one is free roam, and you can actually take your own routes to win a race if neccessary.All-in-all, this game will be well worth your money. Even more so if you bought the EA Humble Bundle, which is what I did. As far as burnout games go this is the best one right next to Burnout Revenge.			"

												Looking for a decent Racing game?Pros: Awesome cars and bikes, still an excelent game regardless of being kind of old.Good graphics, the detail on the vehicles are incredible. Tons of achievements, races, cars, and the music the radio plays while you drive is such a large amount of good soundtracks that will make your ride much better.Cons: There are only like 4 different motorcycles and thats not cool.Game is repetitive and playing it often can cause some boring issues.You can´t play it offline, and that's terrific if you want to play single player, need to be online on steam.

												This is a pretty good car and motorcycle driving game that allows you total freedom to go wherever you want in the huge world of Paradise City. And you don't have to do the challenges until you want to (completing challenges unlocks more vehicles). Although the game does have some MAJOR flaws (some of which are just plain stupid and should have been changed/fixed). There is no speedometer at all. You can't listen to your own music files on your computer while playing the game unless you run your own media player in the background. If you're playing online and your framerate gets too low, the game automatically kicks you from the server (even if it's your own server that you're hosting). Yes, you can get kicked from your own server if your framerate gets too low. There is no in game text chatting. You have to use a mic to communicate with other players on a server. As you upgrade your license, the races get MUCH harder because the AI will very often put cars right in front of you which are almost guaranteed to make you crash over and over. If you go too fast, you are very likely to crash over and over. If you take your time, it can be hard to get to first place. So it's a pretty good game, but with some MAJOR flaws. This game has given me an idea as to why EA was voted the world's worst video game company multiple times. Because of this game's MAJOR flaws, I don't recommend it			"

												Burnout has traditionally been a series of incredibly high-speed races where you race to the finish line, while destroying your opponents cars in a sweet, satisfying, firey spectacle.Paradise does this, but it adds a few more game modes, and an open-world concept.This game is an example of open-world done in the wrong way. Essentially, the driving around that you do in the open world is not particularly fun. There is not much to do, and you are only doing it to get to the next event. All of the Burnout appeal mentioned in the first sentence of this review is completely absent when driving around on the open world streets.So, while the game still has the fun Burnout experience, it is watered down with tons and tons of filler.6/10 ""Okay""			"

												Racing is my favorite sport, and my favorite genre of games, hands down. If you are looking for a simulation racing experience, this is without a doubt NOT the game for you. However, this is one of the most fun arcade-style racing experiences I have ever had. The crash physics are some of the best ever seen to this very day, the racing is intense and challenging, there are plenty of small missions to do all around Paradise City, and the cars (while heavily inspired by actual vehicles) are all pretty unique in their own way. Not to mention that it can run on just about any PC made after 2005. If you want a fun, crazy, and simple racing game, this is a must have.			"

												This game has a very weird combination of Open World and Racing Game, although the two very rarley go hand in hand, Burnout Paradise pulls it off. At just about every stoplight in the game there is some kind of event, wether it be a race, demolition derby, etc. they are always well made and well executed. The way you progress through the game is by getting wins and upgrading you ""license"" this unlocks new cars/bikes and your ""licence"" looks pretty too! This is one of the best racing games i've played and I liked it! Pro Tip: Keyboards suck for racing games your better off with a controller or some kind of analog input..			"

												How did I miss this when it came out? This was one of the better buys I made at this years summer sale, absolutely brilliant design in  racing games. The entire theme is an open world grindfest to level up your licence  and get better cars. Had a feel of the driver games without any pesky police to bother you.  The crash cinematic's are absolutely gorgeous, and make me want to take those extreme jumps , just to see if I can wreck my car even more spectacularly than last time. This is the essential racing game for fans of the genre.			"

												For some reason, I was a little dissapointed when I wasn't allowed to just race in a relaxing way. But this game does what it does well, I think... I'm not the racing games expert. You race, and you hit other racers and (optionally) time your nitro to do fancy jumps you kinda planned in advance? It's alright. I still had a good time for a while.			"

												I really liked the original burnout games on Gamecube and I have fond memories of playing them with my older brothers.By contrast, this game felt half finished.  The graphics were a let down.  Even the handling and physics of the vehicles felt poor.  Whilst expecting Gran Turismo mechanics would be absurd, this game tries to mask its laziness behind arcade-y-ness. I vote to pass on this title.			"

												Looking for a game to race, crash other cars and make awesome stunts?This is the game for you.Burnout Paradise is a fun freeroam racing game that never gets boring. The challenges get harder and there are alot of cars to unlock. When you have completed the game for a full 100%, you still won't be bored when redoing the challenges.			"

												This game is pretty good, though in my book it takes third-best Burnout game behind Dominator and Revenge. The open world is nicely scaled, not being too large or too small, and the unlockable cars give this game a reason to be played for 20+ hours. Just make sure to not delete then reinstall the game, otherwise your progress will be wiped. By the way, you should get this game for your Xbox or Playstation, as both of those contain more DLC than this version does.			"

												Is not for you if...- You are into realistic driving simulation.- You hate looking at map all the time.- You like epic corner turning.- you just dont like raceing game in general.Is for you if...- You like crush actions.- You like arcade racing.- more crush actions.Do note that this is single player experience only. Online is no longer supported. (However, EA still requires origin account to log in and play the game. WHY? I wish my butt hair can tell me.This game is not a racing game, is a crushing simulater. You dont play this game for the tracks, you play this game to crush other cars into dust.The road rage mode is the only worth awhile mode in this game. Other modes are jokes. "

												So the game mechanics hold up, and the gameplay is pretty fun, until you get your class A liscence and every other car becomes OP while your car suddenly has the crappiest handling ever. However, there is some EA ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t inthis game. Thankfully no origin is needed, however there's product placement everywhere and the menu system is intentionally terrible just to force you to lok at dlc you can't even buy. I have to admit though, there's nothing better than watching a crumpled car fly through the air in slow motion from the optimal camera angle. The only other problem i have with this game is the way you can clearly see no one is in any of the cars. I want gore dammit!			"

												One of the best arcade style racing games of this generation. Much better than Need for Speed. Burnout Paradise takes from previous Burnout titles the insane speed, and emphasis on wreck or be wrecked style of racing that has been cloned now in several other arcade racing titles. But nobody can do it better than Burnout. What Paradise adds over previous Burnout titles is an open world hub to race around in be it on 4 wheels, or now on 2 wheels with the addition of motorcycles. Open world gameplay adds a new spin on progression, as expected, and also opens up point to point races in a whole new way. No more barriers. The other cars go left? You go right. Right to the finish line. Or right into a brick wall. Granted, this is still an EA title, so there are some annoyances. Lack of DLC over on the steam version being one. Also, poor update support. And on top of that, EA's signature annoying announcer, unskippable cutscenes, and a soundtrack that can not make it's mind up. Guns N Roses, Faith No More, Soundgarden? Nice! Avril Lavigne.....WHAT? Okay. Nitpicking the last few parts. But anyway, the ultimate box is quite nice for the price! I just wish I could buy DLC from steam.			"
