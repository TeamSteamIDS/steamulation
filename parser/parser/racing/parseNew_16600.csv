												Challenging. That's the word you want to read and remember. You drive a motorcycle and you have to do stunts to get to the finish line. The graphics are great, the sounds as well, and the puzzles are, well... remember that word I told you to at the beginning of this mini review ? Yes ? Great ! My job is done.Excellent game though ! Great to play for a few minutes or a few hours.[Rating: 80/100]			"

												I started playing trials with Trials HD on the Xbox arcade where I would build my own tracks and try and beat top scores over and over.This edition of the game is great and feels good when doing a perfect run. The mechanics of the bike and the physics-based rider makes the game have a funny side as well.I give this a 8.5/10 for being a great pickup and play game.			"

I bought it on steam a few months ago. For a 2008 game (youll see me say 2008 game alot) It's actually stunning, physics and graphics ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant. It's sad the game is dead and no one is in chat anymore, I still play this game and I highly encourage you to get this game instead of the new ones like trials fusion♥♥♥♥♥♥ This is the real og this is the real trials.

												Trials 2 is a great game, i had great times playing it.  Controls are very simple, just throttle, break, tilt back and forward, but the game becomes very technical as you pass the levels and every little movement will count on your performance. It´s not like all those tilt games out there, this has really nice physics and gameplay, and a lot of havoc!Also is a great game to play when you only have 5 or 10 minutes available. You can race with ghosts or watch replays from others players, and when you see the best players runs you cannot believe how good you can get to be.  It´s a very fun game with a lot of crazy stunts, i recommend it to any person.			"

												For a $2.49 purchase price it wasn't too bad. After clearing the stages I didn't have any desire to go back and replay, perhaps if I had the option of running vs AI bikes or online people at the same time (onscreen) it'd have been a different scenario but as it stands, it was a purchase I could have gone without.The gameplay is tight but there are moments of ""UGH I WILL DESTROY YOU."" There are some physics exaggeration but that is to be expected for a title like this to work and be successful. While they are exaggerated they do make sense. The audio is quite repetitive and the music, oh the music... I'd have preferred being able to load my own music instead of listening to the garbage. I turned it off.In the end I can't recommend this game because there are newer editions out that *should* feature the onscreen multiplayer I mentioned.			"

												Compared to newer entries in the Trials series, Trials 2 feels incredibly dated. Its lack of polish, unrefined and floaty physics, and just general quality-of-life features show just how far RedLynx have come over the years. This is a very barebones game, but it was necessary for the devs to get to the point that they're at now. As it stands, this is a decently fun little time-waster, but the Miniclip sponsorship signs in the background show you exactly what kind of mindset you should approach this with.Overall, I recommend skipping this version and picking up Trials Evolution or Fusion instead. Or, you could even play their mobile app, which is also very good.			"

												This game easily the most brutal and unforgiving game I have ever played.  If you can mange to get it to stop crashing and freezing your graphics card, you will be treated to ridiculous elasticy physics and frustrating glitches (like your bike folding in half on a regular basis).The learning curve is extremely steep, which is reflected by the nearly impossible achievements.  In order to become half decent at Trials 2, you will need to study replays and practice infuriating sections of track for hours on end, and even then you have no hope of touching the leaderboards.So unless you have a lot of time on your hands, and like extremely difficult challenges, think again before you choose this game.

												Playing Trials 2 is like going to a restaurant, and ordering the chili.First, you're impressed.  It's pretty good!  The meat is tender, the onions and beans are flavorful, the broth is robust.Then, the cook comes out and adds some Cayenne pepper, to give it just a little spice.  Superb!  Well done!And then the cook comes out again and adds some more Cayenne pepper.  Well, I mean... why?  It's quite good the way it is.  You can still taste the other ingredients, and it's not bad, but things are kind of getting overwhelmed by the spice.And then the cook comes out once more and dumps a gallon if Cayenne pepper into your dish.  Now you're irritated, but you know there's good chili in there, right?  You take a bite, and try to ignore the spiciness, but even when you find a great big chunk of meat or something, all you can taste is spice.  Spice, spice, spice.Difficulty is good in a game.  A little spice is more than nice.  But when your game's gimmick is that it gets so difficult that you can no longer taste the enjoyable stuff, well... what's the point?  Who wants to eat THAT dish?A bad chef is one who sucks at chili.  An unforgivable chef is one who ruins good chili.  The same goes for game devs - good game, ruined because some idiot was all like ""XTREEEEEEEM MEANS HARD, RIGHT?""  I will not be purchasing any games by Red Lynx again.			"

												Probably one of the most addictive platform games I've played in my life. The maps are often frustratingly challenging and teeth grindingly finicky when time trials are concerned. Its difficulty curve is somewhat fair, but towards the end of the tracks they seem almost impossible. It's a truly satisfying feeling when you manage to pass a small part of the track you had been stuck on for a long time, and the feeling you get when you finish a difficult track makes the whole process worthwhile. The game has some of the best achievements I've ever tried to get. Ranging from simply finishing all tracks in a difficulty set with no faults, to completing an entire level while holding the accelerator down... without faulting.The game never feels unfair and often times failure feels like the fault of the driver and not the game.10/10. Best Motocycle Platform Game I've ever played.			"

												This is a really fun game but it is much better on the Xbox. If you use a controller the response is very slow and even using the trigger for accelerating you either get off or on full. This makes the hard levels much harder than they should be.I will recommend this game but would say if you want to play it properly, get the Xbox versions as this just seems to me as though the programers got it looking good then just said ""meh!"" to the controls.
