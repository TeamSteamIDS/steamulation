												Switch Galaxy Ultra is a first Steam game made by indie studio Atomicom Limited, who deserve, for start, a praise for their attempt at great charity gesture, as they made a DLC from which the profit goes towards Caudwell Children.But take down that rose-coloured glass, the game offers mediocre gameplay based on switching lanes on a galactic highway. All you do is just dodging all barriers (coloured barriers or other vehicles) and trying to get as fast as you can to your target location that you have picked on a map before. The speed of your vehicle overall feels really weird. You'll mostly feel that you are driving too slow, or too fast, and you won't get even proper means to balance it somehow - yes, you can use a boost (for a second) or a brake, but that doesn't change much after all. Anyway, if you get too much fast and you crash a barrier, you just get automatically turned to the lowest speed possible. There are few vehicles to pick with several skins and upgrades, but those only show that it actually doesn't matter how good you are at the game. You'll buy upgrades for boosts, faster lane switching, etc. There are more than 50 levels to satisfy your need for speed and dodge, but I'm afraid it doesn't matter in the end since the game gets boring pretty fast. It isn't much pleasant to play (especially in compare to great Audiosurf by Dylan Fitterer), there will be just few gameplay mechanics you'll like at the first time - but that doesn't mean that you'll like it again in next levels, because it feels like it gets more uninspired, level after level, until new primitive gameplay mechanic shows up (like stealing money from drones that drive next to you).The game also suffers from pretty poor menu design that doesn't feel much intuitive. The icing on the cake is a dialogue that won't tell you how to close them - few players already thought the game has frozen, you can see it in game's Steam discussion. Also, if you plan to play with a  controller, consider the fact it's really only partially supported - the game only hints the keyboard buttons in tutorials.Let's not be so negative, there are things that definitely deserve kudos. The game's story is split into comic episodes made by Darren Douglas that look great. Personally, I would rather spend my time with those comics (and I'm not a fan of comics) than playing this game. Also, the Steam achievements are granted only for something that needs your effort, which I find nice against the current trend of granting achievements for every single thing in games.Switch Galaxy Ultra is not worth recommending, as a reflex ""lane switcher"" game it's poor and boring with uninteresting presentation that just gets saved by seven comic episodes which gets unlocked through the game. It has many examples of redundant and bad feature design, like buying keys (for one use) to unlock barriers in levels.			"

Jumping into this game I was immediately slapped in the face by the music (In a good way) I really did like the audio to the game. I could sit there and close my eyes just listening to it. Anyyywayy-I really hope they sell the OST with this game. The game is a racing game - on the rails is what it feels like where you swap between lanes avoiding obstacles which slow you down. There are various obstacles such as walls, enemies and red strips in which you get a slow down warning for each time you hit them. The main objective is to get from start to finish in under a certain time to get under the time limit and win gold. When you win, you get credits and you can unlock more upgradeable parts for your vehicle. Such as cosmetics, parts like turbo.The visuals to the game are pretty in which you can see Planets and such in the background but after a while it starts to get repetitive. The graphics were pretty decent though and I enjoyed stargazing often whilst slamming into a barrier with some crazy woman screaming at me saying I'm going to break the vehicle.Instead of traditional cutscenes they go for a more comic book style which works out quite fun and is interesting, although I ended up pressing enter to skip them half way through haha.My only problem is that there is partial controller support and sometimes you have to swap from controller to keyboard. Another problem is when checking the controls it only shows the keyboard controls so you're left baffled with not knowing the controls. (A is boost and B is brake - With the left thumbstick used to navigate through the lanes).I found the game pretty difficult and fans of F-Zero and futuristic racing games will definitely love this and depending on the price this game could prove a good buy. I have attached a 20 minute preview video because my writing is not so great and it will help a lot more with helping you decide. I would avoid if you're not really into the futuristic racing scene and didnt enjoy F-Zero and the likes.(Sellout mode begin) Feel free to visit www.thehiddenlevels.com for more reviews, previews, guides, walkthroughs and even giveaways.

												This is a game whose core idea is surprisingly sound, and more compelling than I thought it would be, but is implemented into a game that's constantly at cross-purposes with itself. Your vehicle upgrades matter more than your agility, and as you start with the most upgradeable one, there's no reason to ever use or upgrade another.  While there are tracks that show they know how to give you -just- enough of a view to quickly react, all too many contain spots where you literally cannot see what's oncoming.  There's a reverse-your-controls debuff that's leaned on entirely too much, and that reverses your boost and brake buttons in a way that knocks you out of the game (given you otherwise just hold down boost at all times).  Buying gate keys and track info is completely pointless, and ""gold"" times and tantalum are just the same thing (that is, the tantalum you get is just based on finish time, and the time needed to get all the tantalum is the same as the gold time).Oh, and the gates are the four usual suspect colors, with no way to change 'em.  If you're red-green colorblind, it will be a problem.Dodging gates is surprisingly fun. Get into it, get a good streak going and you feel like a ninja, it's awesome. And those moments are much rarer than they should be, due to several elements of the game's design.  Honestly, it's not worth it.			"

												Very challenging game. It starts out easy for maybe the first 3 levels until all types of barriers come into play. The visuals are pleasing, and the ost is nice. I really like that some of the proceeds for this go to charity. I'm an old school Wipeout player used to insane speeds, but i mean it when i say this gets hard FAST. I have so far played about 7 or 8 levels in and i am struggling to not hit barriers as i switch lanes. Some suggestions: I would like to see more controller compatibility with the menu, the way the controls are mapped for the 360 game pad is a bit strange. Anyone who likes Audio Surf would probably like this, the concept is very similar.			"

												First of all, the story was super boring, so I had to skip the whole thing.The game itself was mostly nice, the graphics were really good, and over all I did come back to the game a few times and tried to finish it, so it wasn't too boring.It's possible to figure out and beat gold time on most levels once you upgrade your ship to the end, though I'm not sure how possible is the achivement for beating the whole game without to buy anything.On the last levels I got too bored and didn't bother trying to beat the gold times, cause there is a thing that flips your controls at the middle of the race with no way to avoid it, and it was just WAY too annoying.I was very disappointed to find out that nothing really happens at the end - you are simply being sent back to the first map (I even tried to recheck the story to see if it explains anything, but it didn't really). That was a bummer, as it doesn't even tell you if you finished the game or not, so I could only assume I did.I think the game is worth the low price I've got it for, but I don't think it's worth its full price.If you play, I recommand doing the first upgrade for each level in order to see the gold time you need to beat.

												Ok, this is not something I want to do, but I'm not going to sit idle if the developers are.As far as the game is concerned, it's fine. It plays nice, and such... On Windows.I, however, use a Linux PC. Primarily one that is 64 bit in nature. Switch Galaxy Ultra, despite having a SteamOS logo and ""Linux/SteamOS compatibility"", doesn't even get off the ground on my Linux PC. Why? Well, if you look on the forum, you might find a post regarding how 64 bit Linux distros are failing to run this program due to missing libraries. The game is looking for 32 bit versions of said libraries instead of the 64 bit versions that may ALREADY be installed on said system.This has been going on since the game was released. The developer is aware of the situation, but have yet to patch an update. There have been no updates as to its progress since I brought it to their attention.As it stands, if a user wants to fix this, they can just download the 32 bit .deb files and extract them to the game's library directory, which does make the game work. (This was also detailed in the forum post.) Developer has not reacted to the findings.I will admit, I did get this game on a sale where it was at a discount. However, I did get DLC with it. None of it works on my Linux PC.So, as a result, I did something I really DIDN'T want to do... and I installed the game on my Windows PC and played it long enough to leave a negative review. It has been months since I brought the issue to their attention. It has been since the game was released that it has been broken on ALL 64 bit Linux distros. I tried giving them ample time to fix their problem, but not one peep has been made about it. It's a real shame, too.Now, should they fix it, I'll be happy to reverse my recommendation upon testing on my Linux PC. I WANT to give a positive review. I want to support Linux developers. Unfortunately, when the developer doesn't develop their game past a broken state, I can't honestly support the developer's work. If they were honest with their Linux release, it would at the very least work on all forms of SteamOS distros, including the 64 bit version. Since someone using the 64 bit SteamOS mentioned it didn't, I'm going to have to leave a negative review for now. Here's hoping they fix the issue soon.			"

												Switch Galaxy Ultra is an interesting combination of racing, reflexes and puzzles. The basic objective is to get through every level as fast as possible while hitting as few things as possible. Things move very fast and can get extremely challenging quickly but you can buy information on upcoming levels as well as upgrade your ship to make things easier and there are no shortage of ways to earn credits to do so, either through replaying existing levels or the endless survival mode.There is a story that's presented in some snazzy looking comics that you unlock at certain points in the campaign but it's a story that doesn't really need to be there. Still, the comics are nice to look at and there is a surprising amount of exposition for a game of this type if you want to see it.Where Switch Galaxy Ultra falls down is in its progression system and its complete lack of explanation for it, despite the lengthy tutorial. In the console version, you collect Tantalum (the resource you need to unlock later levels) in a little minigame section in the middle of the levels. You then had to get through the second, harder section of the level without hitting anything as doing so would lose you Tantalum. That minigame has been removed from the PC version and apparently (according to discussions I had with the game's Community Manager), how much Tantalum you get is now figured out via a combination of how fast you beat the level and how few things you hit throughout it. This is never explained anywhere and I still am not sure it's accurate as in later levels, I managed to beat the par time significant while hitting almost nothing and still didn't earn any Tantalum from it. About 2 hours in, I'm now stuck and unable to lock further levels and I don't know what to do. This could very likely be resolved by some simple tutorialising, which the developers left out for no apparent reason.Performance is also not fantastic. This game doesn't look bad but certainly not AAA and on my GTX 970, it regularly dropped frames at 1080p. For something that relies on sharp reflexes, this really isn't acceptable.Overall, I still recommend Switch Galaxy Ultra as it has cool ideas but just know what you're getting into before you buy it. If you don't like progression systems that require some detective work on your end and you don't like fast reflex games, this one will frustrate you to no end. If you think you'd be into that though, there's a lot to enjoy here. Check out my video to learn more and see it in action.

												Essentially, Switch Galaxy Ultra is what you'd get if you married WipeOut's game mechanics with AudioSurf's visuals (but not the capability to race to your own music). All the basics are here: you race to earn fuel to travel to different systems in order to continue racing. Along the way, you earn money in the form of credits, which can be used to purchase new ships, upgrades, and new paint jobs. Music and sound effects are decent, but nothing special. Why the developer has a music pack DLC available is anyone's guess. Graphics are okay. although they certainly aren't what I'd expect in a three month old game (the game was released on Nov 20, 2015 and this review was written on Feb 20, 2016), although I suppose cutting an indie title like SGU some slack in this area is only fair. Unfortunately, there are some major problems with SGU. The voice acting is atrocious and characters pronounce words oddly, as if English isn't their first language. Maybe it isn't, but if you're going to do voice recording in English, you'd better get voice actors who can do it without sounding like a bad comedy sketch. I have to assume the developer tagged friends, family, and co-workers to do the voice work. If not, then they must've hired the cheapest professional voice actors in the area. Controls are also a little weird. Although you can use the keyboard or controller to guide your ship, all the visual cues in the game are from the keyboard. Normally I wouldn't have an issue with that (if nothing else, usually the opposite is true), but a game like this seems better suited to a controller and if the game acknowledges one, the cues should change depending on which gaming device is being used.Would I recommend Switch Galaxy Ultra? Not at its normal price $9.99 USD, but if you could find it on sale (like right now, when it's 80% off at $1.99 USD), then it might be worth it. Because the rating system on Steam only allows a ""yes or no"" decision, I'll have to vote no since I can't give a positive vote to a game where the decision to purchase it hinges on a huge discount.

												Switch Galaxy Ultra has its charm and appeal, however, the PC port of this game has some glaring issues that need to be addressed in order to be a proper PC port.The game supports NO mouse controls for menu navigation whatsoever, the sound settings only have Music/Effects on/off, there are no graphics settings at all, except for toggling lights and shadows. The worst of these offenders has to be the fact that although the game settings imply it has several different languages you can choose from to play the game, it defaults to your OS/your country's language WITH NO WAY TO CHANGE IT IN-GAME OR ON STEAM SETTINGS. This is a really serious issue, especially for people who want to record gameplay for websites like Youtube and Twitch, who would rather have everything in English.But if only the translations were good enough to warranty playing it in my native language. Unfortunately, the game suffers from near Google-translate levels of translation (regarding PT-PT/PT-BR) and it really detracts from the experience overall.Gameplay is simple and ramps up difficulty nicely, Levels start slow enough, introducing mechanics little by little so the player can get accostumed to solving problems at higher speeds.As it is at the moment, I cannot recommend the PC version as is. If the issues I've outlined are fixed later on in the game's lifespan and with support for post-release by the devs it that happens, I will re-evaluate this review.			"

												Switch Galaxy Ultra is a game can play intensly or relexed (if you don't get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off quickly)It also has a stratagy aspect to it and this is what makes it a lot more intrusting.I would recommend it if you have epilepsy or motion sickness (i have motion sickness and there are some levels where that really kicks in and there are also flashy intro screens)you collect tokens to unlock other levels the further you get the harder it is to get the tokens and the more you need so if you like a challenge it is a awesome game.

												Sooooo, this game is bad. Really bad.First of all the language CANNOT be changed. That's always an automatic no for me anyway. Second, the translation, at least into German ranges from so so to very bad. There are words that simply don't exist, grammar is used when it suited the translator it seems. Even Google Translate would do a better job at that. Seeing as I AM a EN-DE translator this hurts like hell.Now, onto the game. The game itself could actually be fun you know...I say ""could"", because there are things happening that make me just shake my head.First: You have to collect ""Tantalum"" on each stage (10 at most) which serves as your ""fuel"", only that it doesn't. It's a progression barrier, nothing more. This game is advertised with you going at break neck speed, but all the mechanics, at least what I could gather from reviews, work against that goal. Apparently you are to collect this Tantalum in the middle of a level, in a wormhole mini game. My problem? I've encountered the worm holes, but not the mini games. After that is complete any hit with a barrier (you know the ones on the screen shots you should avoid?) should cause you to lose 1 Tantalum, only they don't? I don't know anymore...for me getting Tantalum seems to be random. As I said there are no mini games to collect it as far as I experienced. Sometimes I get 0 Tantalum without hitting any barriers, sometimes I get 10 but hit like 3 or 4 barriers in the second half of the race. I DO NOT understand this. My only conclusion so far seems to be, that despite what all the reviews say, speed is the only thing that matters? I don't know, I didn't read anything about that in the tutorials which pop up with each new element. Maybe I need to keep playing until I can't progress to trigger that one???? Who knows....I'll update this review as soon as I know more. Anyway, on we go:Controls: Seem tight enough, although hitting a speed boost only seems to work when you hit it right at the beginning and not just anywhere. However, the game only recognizes keyboards? My controller works fine, but no button prompts are being displayed elsewhere, not even in the options menu.Graphics: The screenshots are faked imho. The game doesn't look nearly as pretty, and there are no options to change to speak of anyway, apart from resolution, full screen and some effects.Sound: Good enough, nothing special though.Conclusion: I bought it at 2 dollars or so...I consider those 2 dollars wasted for now. Too bad. This game should be about going fast and crazy, yet it seems to just want to stall you at every turn to earn more currency. Get rid of that bs and just give us interesting tracks, that don't obstruct your view at times, which makes it almost impossible to dodge a barrier. Brakes should not even be in this game *sigh*			"

												It's nice to look at. I hope you have a keyboard you don't care about so you don't break your gamepad. Reminds me of F-Zero in a boring way.

												I thought the game was pretty fun. It was pretty basic but I had a good time. It was hard to control and keep up with the game as far as I got but I'm bad at games so whoops. The main thing about this game for me, though, is that it gave me pretty bad motion sickness. After about an hour or so, I got pretty light-headed and then my stomach started to not feel good. This might not happen to everyone but it's probably worth mentioning!

												My overall rating of the game: 2.5/5(In all fairness, It's not my style of game)Graphics: ExcellentMusic: Good Enough.Cinematics: Not as good as I had hoped. Comic book style.Story: Good enough for me to skip.Content: Lacking. Controls: You have to buy upgrades for a better response time.Gameplay: WARNING: Repetitive.  The vehicles sluggish and but control as perfectly intended. Seemed geared for the ""completionist"".  Not sure if it would be good for someone with epilepsy or motion sickness. You must change lanes to avoid obstacles which will slow you down and to hit a booster changer as well as collect credits. Apparently the goal, get from start to finish as fast as you can.Steamable: Poor frame rate during my live streams. Viewers did not enjoy. "

												Played a few minutes, the stutters and lag were bad enough that I wouldn't want to spend anymore time on it. The game would appear to freeze, but would continue to progress.Intel i7 4790k stock speeds watercooledNvidia GTX 97016GB DDR3 2400 ram480GB SSD			"
