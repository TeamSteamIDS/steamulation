												It's on sale for $0.29 right now, but you're better off just buying a gumball instead. It's four cents cheaper and you can blow bubbles.			"

												I think that game is fun only wth friends, bots are too easy or very hardcore. But if you are bored, and you have 2 euros on steam wallet collecting dust, why not?			"

												Very well built physics based game.Good strong deep intellectual story lineGreat complex characters.I'll never forget the final boss fight.. nearly put me to tears.Highly skill based. I would not be surprised if this game was considered for MLG.Not for everyone however.The competitive edge will turn some casuals away.10/10			"

												I do not recommend this game for anyone over the age of 8. There is little to no challenge even on the highest difficulty, the voices are dreadfully squeaky and annoying and the music is barely tolerable. I bought this game for 29 cents and I still feel as if it was a complete waste of money.			"

												This game reminds me a lot of games I used to play on other consoles.. It is a 90's game when they created a lot of these games ... still nice to play with your friends. Although no servers cause no one still plays it but you can do a LAN server or singleplayer.Nice game6.5/10-Diesel			"

												This is an evolution of the human race. Only in my dreams have I witnessed slimy gumballs sloshing around in different gamemodes! Don't even get me started on the only server! It's the best server you can imagine, based in the czech republic. If I went on this review would be at least 4 pages long. BUY THIS NOW!!!UPDATE: The game really is just a mediocre flash game that you have to pay for. Has frame rate drops, buy this for your friend, not yourself. You're not missing anything. Pros:Kinda fun at timesCons:Too easyBroken Multiplayer (I started my own server and couldn't even join)Framerate dropsJust noUPDATE # DOS: I recently made a steam group for this game, join if you want!!

Grab when on sale only.			"

												Fun minigames for killing time. Single or Multiplayer. Capture the flag, gather gems and races. I recommend you turn up the speed just a bit.			"

												Bought this came because I needed to make a purchase in order to get me some of those sweet cs:go skins. And let me tell you, I was not dissapointed. This is the cheapest game on steam at the moment, yet it's still fun, I dont know why. I'd recommend for kids, or casual gamers. The sounds are awesome. Controls are a bit icky, but you get used to them. Gamemodes are fun. AND AWESOME PRICE.			"
