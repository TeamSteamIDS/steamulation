												Is a fun challenging little game in bursts. Developer is honest and enjoys this so expect more updates.  "

Early Access Review
								i love this game. finally classic gaming in VR. i forgot how tough games can be.it took me a while to control the asteroidish car and to be able to look around to spawn the track. looks way easier on the video.frustrating at first but became very satisfying once i got further on the map.so far very replayabe and unbelievable challenging.great vr game!
