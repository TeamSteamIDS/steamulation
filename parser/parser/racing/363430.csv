												Would be good if this was on early access...  But there really isn't anything here worth playing.  You can't even race against other trucks so it's all time trials.  The ability to paint your truck is neat but in addition to that it would have been nice to have more than 1 different truck in the game.  If there was a career mode with upgradeable trucks and an actual path of progression it would be more interesting.  Right now you have 5 or 6 tracks and you can drive through them.  That's the game.  It's very buggy.  The mountains just flicker randomly in many tracks, it is practically epilepsy-warning level of flickering.  It looks funny though, I was laughing the whole time but I was thinking it was early access but apparently this is their finished product.  I will commend them for including both a pushbutton-handbrake and an analog handbrake but there is a problem with that.  What I did was assign my handbrake to the right analog stick so I could try out (for the first time ever) the feeling of an analog handbrake in a game but due to the deadzone in the stick it causes the transmission to break.  As in, if you center the joystick and it is only 0.05% off-center the transmission will cease to function and you can go in top gear and redline it and you won't be able to move.  So that doesn't work at all, and to top it off you can't UN-assign a button so once you have assigned it you don't have the ability to change it.  In my opinion this game would be more fun without the invisible walls in the open areas of the track.  I know you are supposed to just do the races but I see vast flickering mountains in the distance and it would have been fun to just go off-roading over there and explore.  At no point does it even feel like ""off roading"", it's more like driving on a gravel roads.  I live out in the boonies with gravel roads so this just seems normal to me.  Overall I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Literally the best part of the game is the fact that you can drive the truck in the menu/garage.  This game has a retail price of $20 and for that amount of money you can get a copy of Spintires at a discount and play a REAL off roading game.			"

												I wrote a review a while back, saying this game was alright, and to only buy it if you had a G27, or any other simulation grade wheel. Now, this new update changes it, and now, buy it if you really like off road racing with trucks.First off, this game went through a massive overhaul to DX11, so that is a nice thing to see. Updates to support Mac and Linux came through, and several other bugs were ironed out. However, there are still bugs in this game. I will explain them a little more going through this.New tracks were added, old ones overhauled to reflect new objects in the game, and new vehicles came out. Along side the Stadium Super Truck (SST), Pro4 and Pro2 trucks, ProLite Karts, and AWD Hatchback, there is a 4WD Monster Truck, known as the Ruckus, and a 4WD Crawler. Another bug is that I can't find old skins that were in the previous version of the game. Something else that needs to be changed.More camera options also came out for this game, not only allowing you to be in first person view, and Following camera view, there's also a rotate camera, drone camera, and a Larry Camera, for walking and stuff. As Larry, you can wash things, which is pretty neato, but the way he holds it looks a bit...suggestive. Viewmodel placement in the next update would be nice.Lastly, and I've been holding out for this, track creation! This is by far my favorite part of the update. It is somewhat similar to the track creator for Mx Vs Atv Unleashed, but somethings that need to be added is an Undo button, which the developer said he will add in sometime. When saving a level, the game freezed for me. Probably because I have this game not on my boot drive, and my OS drive, where the track files are kept (probably?), is full, and I can't continue on. A option to select a folder to store track files would be nice, or just default it to the Documents Folder, which you can move to a separate drive.To add, Steam Workshop integration is also here, allowing you to share and download tracks with others in the community, and Multiplayer, however, with the amount of people who play this game, I don't see that coming into effect yet.A pretty good game, all coming from 1 person. This is a cool little project that he/she is doing, and by buying the game, can continue that dream, making this game look good on their resume, and hopefully land their dream job at a large company, or build up their own company.7/10 Amazing game, but some features still need to come and bugs need to be ironed out.

												Not happy at all. I have a G27 setup and it simply wont calibrate or configure properly. I am 55 years old, use and have used numerouse simulators and have moddeled and codded several cars and tracks for rFactor so I know what I am talking about. There has got to be some better contol setup or this Sim will fail if it has not already. I am going to attempt to get a refund or credit at this point.			"

												Wow, we basically just got an entirely new game and it's not an Early Access title. The update changed pretty much everything. It shares a lot with is other title, RC Simulation 2.0 but he also made specific tweaks for D Series. It has more camera options, a driver view with animated arms, etc. New vehicles like a Monster Truck and Rock Crawler (complete with winching system) open up a lot of new playstyle choices that weren't in the original game. I'm really impressed with this update. There's also a full track editor and workshop integration. I made a pretty long vid where I tried to go over all of it if you have an interest.

												What a truly appalling game....Runs at 13-15 FPS on a GTX 1080/i7/32GB machine. Looks kind of early 2000's wire frame style, horrid dynamics and very poor control implementation. A serious waste of money.I went in with low expectations expecting something my trophy truck obsessed son could mess around with every now and then... but even with this in mind this game is truly abysmal. Uninstalling....18/01/2017Definite major improvements in all aspects of the game, clearly the dev is moving in the right direction. It's still very ""raw"" and hard to control, but getting better.Physics can be a little ""interesting"" at times.OK time waster, but only buy if on special.			"

												Nice to see the game get updated.  If you put the time in to make yourself some tracks the game is a good bit of fun, for $15 I would definitely suggest it.  Will be nice to see the game hopefully continue to get updates and maybe have some more off road truck specific type objects added to the game!			"

												I like the update. The new cars are great. I need to play with the controller setup and force feedback. I have not looked at the track editor but my son is very interested.I would recommend this game if you like racing or driving simulators.			"

												Firstly i do like the concept. Secondly i do understand this is a one man show. However this title should NEVER have been released in its state. I cant even play it. My wheel wont work properly massive d3ad zone you cant dial out my pedals dont work at all.. the dev boasts great ffb yet with Thrustmaster TX and clubsport pedals there is NO ffb crap sounds and alot of gfx clipping. Put simply you pay $18 aud for an alpha release. And no refunds. I had high hopes for this as i really wanted to drive the trucks... guess ill have to wait for them to be added to dirt rally			"

												Very much enjoy this game . Very high attention to detail after dx11 update - vehichles collect dust etc . Extremely impressive especially when considering it's been done by a one man team ? Must buy all racing games as they seen to be a dying breed  - especially sims like this .			"

												This is a good and respectful game. the inputs are fully customizable, even if you're using xinput. there is no annoying steering dampening, no forced deadzone or any ♥♥♥♥ like that. controls just work. the physics are a bit jumpy but still acceptably believable. the deep vehicle setup system is fun.

												Amazing.This game makes you feel like you're actually in an off-road trophy truck. I'm not kidding, the force feedback is amazing. Of course, if you don't have a FFB wheel, it's not entirely the same, but do not pass up this amazing game.Sure, there is no AI. There is no multiplayer (which I will explain more later on), but just the single player experience alone is enough for me to pour plenty of hours into this game.Many people in the community hub and even the reviews have complained about graphics.Graphics, in my opinion, do not make or break a game for me. Do they make a game look better? Sure. Do they hinder my gaming experience? No. Maybe it's just me, but when I play a video game it's usually not one thing that can make it or break it for me. I'll use GTA V for an example: I love the graphics in that game. The sunsets are beautiful. But that's not the whole game. The game has so many other features that it's almost overwhelming. So, back to my point, graphics should not ruin an entire game for somebody. It might be because I grew up with old Nintendos in the house, but I've never seen graphics as a problem. And to be honest, the graphics in this game do not look all that bad; to me they look pretty professional.I can't wait for people to start raging on me for saying that graphics don't matter.Questions:I have a few questions I would like to be answered, if possible.Will there actually be any multiplayer or AI implemented into the game at some point in the future? I understand if not; like I said, still an amazing game. Even local multiplayer, or just some simple AI in the game would be nice. If not; no problem. I understand Devotid Media is a one-dev team (or so I've seen, correct me if I'm wrong), and it would be quite the amount of work to have to put into the game to implement these features.Another question: will there be more vehicles? The current fleet is awesome on it's own, and I'm sure modding in new models is/will be a possibility, but developer-made vehicles are well-tested and professional.An amazing simulator that I will be replaying plenty of times. Also, huge props to the developer (whose name I cannot recall) for making a game of this size and quality. Sorry for the wall of text, but this is a game I will be playing over, and over, and over.

												This is not a Dirt style arcade racer. This is meant to be a full Off Road racing sim and you're going to have the most fun with some sort of FFB setup. However, you can play it with almost any controller. Dev sacrificed initial graphics for real feel and got it right. There are plans to update graphics while this game and funding grows but for a single person development, this project is fantastic. Price point is right for the product. Looking forward to future updates and projects from Devoid Media.			"

												Cant say I care for the handling of the trucks. Feels like driving on ice since I got a G27 wheel.  Very frustrating to drive. And I have driven offroad with an offroad mini buggy I build. My mini was much easier to drive despite have 120 hp at about 800 lbs.

												I'm not a big gamer and thought I could use keyboard functions to operate, but I was wrong. Do not purchase game if you don't have a wheel. I don't recall seeing anything in the requirements that you would need a wheel. Glad I didn't pay full price, but for $8.99 graphics are decent.			"
