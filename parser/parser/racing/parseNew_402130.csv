Back Story2008: Bugbear released FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage for PC. It was a remastered verison of FlatOut 2, with some new modes, different soundtrack, and new cars. Bugbear just unknowning released their last FlatOut game.2009: The publisher, Empire Interactive, filed for backrupty, and shutdown. Bugbear lost the Flatout IP, where it then went to another publisher, Strategy First. This publisher hired Team 6 to work on a new FlatOut game.2011: Team 6 released Flatout 3: Chaos & Destruction for PC. The game was recieved horribly, with bad AI, bad physics, horrible optimization, lacklust map design, boring gamemodes, and awful car damage. The game was nothing like the original FlatOut games, and became one of the worst games on Steam. 2014: Bugbear released an early access game called Next Car Game (Now known as Wreckfest) to Steam. They said they wanted to go ""back to their roots"" with a ""core FlatOut racing experience"" and a ""tactical damage system"" inspired from the Destruction Derby games. Instead of being the fun game they hoped, it turned into a simulator years later. This means that any ""roots"" they wanted from FlatOut were gone. Fans lost hope that there would ever be a new FlatPOut game.2015: A new game called FlatOut 4: Total Insanity was announced, being made by two new developers, Kylotonn Entertainment and Tiny Rebel Games.2016: Bugbear released another early access game called Stuntfest. This game is based off the stunt ragdoll stunt mode in FlatOut. Instead of making the comsumers happy, it made them mad since they thought the stunt mode was going to be included in Wreckfest.Now it's 2017. FlatOut 4: Total Instanity released for PC. Does it live up to it's predecessors?FlatOut 4: Total Insanity ReviewFlatOut 4 isn't the Bugbear style FlatOut we wanted, but I will say that the game is okay, but not amazing. It has issues that hold back it's potential at restarting the FlatOut series.Optimization/PC SettingsI was a bit disappointed at the lack of settings for graphical changes. I have everything on the highest setting, and the game looks good, but lack luster in some departments. Pop in of props, and shadows are very noticeable. Textures, and particle effects look amazing, although the sparks are too bright, and overexagerated. Some of the images, like with loading screens, are a bit blurry, and pixelated. The game can run over 60 fps, usually with my higher end system I was getting over 120+. The optimization could be better, as like I said before, the pop in is bad, so I wonder if they did that intentionally to make game run better, without actually optimizating it properly. Optimization/PC Settings: 7/10Menu DesignThe menus look great, much like Bugbear's menus, but they are too cluttered with items that can confuse the player.Menu Design: 9/10Controls(I only used a controller) The handling is arcady. It's an improvement over the horrible unsteer seen in FlatOut Ultimate Carnage. Using the e-brake is also much more improved, but you can still spin out. Controls: (For controllers) 9/10CameraWhat an awful camera. It sticks too close to the car, violatly jerks around when spinning the camera, jumping of a ramp, or getting hit by a player. Boosting is even worst, as the camera shakes so erratically my eyes started to hurt. Camera: 0/10GamemodesThe gamemodes are very interesting and fun. The races are filled with destruction. Career can be  grindy at times. The demolition derbies are totally different, as they aren't realistic as previous titles, but still as fun. The new assault mode uses powerups to slow down, and wreck the enemies. It's like Mario cart on steriods, it is crazily fun. The stunt arena is back, with new challenges, and previous challenges making a comeback, like the Rings of Fire. These gamemodes are fun, and will have great replayabilty.Gamemodes: 9/10Online MultiplayerI was unable to find a lobby to test out the multiplayer.Online Multiplayer: n/aVehiclesI was hoping for the return of cars from previous titles, but was disappointed to see nothing. However, the cars in the game are good, and have their own unique personality.Vehicles: 8/10CustomizationJust like FlatOut Ultimate Carnage, the customization is not very extensive, with limited color changes, and no really visual changes, other than the exhaust color. They do still have the useful upgrades with engines, chasis, wheels, etc.Customization: 5/10Track DesignThe tracks are full of props, scenery, and plants to destroy. The tracks aren't nothing special, but they set the mood for FlatOut 4 very nicely.Track Design: 8/10CharactersOne of the big things with FlatOut Ultimate Carnages was the characters you raced against. They had a personality, some were more aggressive, others were more tactical. FlatOut 4's characters feel unspired, and empty. They don't feel different, and sometimes it can be hard to tell who drives what car. In FlatOut Ultimate Carnage, you knew who that b*tch was coming behind you to take you out.Characters: 1/10PhysicsThe physics have been improved for props, but worse for cars. In FlatOut Ultimate Carnage, props would be your worst nightmare. Not only would they slow you down, they usually would flip your car, and spin you right around, messing up your race. Here, the props still have an impact on speed, but they usual don't flip, or spin the car. Now when it comes to vehicle physics, it's a different story. Coupled with the bad camera, may times the vehicles physics will screw up when hitting jumps, getting knocked over, and hitting other player vehicles. They don't feel natural, as the cars seem extremely heavy. In FlatOut Ultimate Carnage, the cars felt more appropriate when it came to weight, and the physics didn't freak out like they do in this game. Physics: 6.5/10PropsLike I mentioned before, the props physics are improved, but I noticed that when a prop was stuck on my vehicle after a while, rather than flying off, it would simple disappear. Other times I drove right through them, without any hit detection.Props: 8/10DamageThe vehicle damage is very interesting. They deform way more than the other games, but in a very unrealistic way. Many times the bumpers don't fall off, and the doors clip through objects when opening. It just doesn't look right.Damage: 6/10AIThe vehicle AI isn't the smartest. They tend to crash themselves. However, they can be aggressive. I have gotten spun out many times by drivers, and they love grinding with other cars. The AI is easier than FlatOut Ultimate Carnage, but they can still put up a fight.AI: 8/10RagdollsCompared to FlatOut Ultimate Carnage, the ragdoll physics are horrible. They don't look natural at all, as they look very stiff, and can clip through objects easily.Radgolls: 3/10SoundThe sound design in this game is meh. Some cars sounds good, while others sound like vacuum cleaners full power. Also, you don't really hear the roar of the other cars in the game.Sound: 4/10SoundtrackThe soundtrack consists mostly of rock, heavy metal, punk rock and rock 'n' roll. I personly don't find the soundtrack that interesting, as FlatOut 2 really nailed the soundtrack, while this game misses the mark in interesting, and enjoyable music. It  doesn't set the mood very well, causing the music to feel out of place with the gameplay.Soundtrack: 5/10Final Score: 6/10FlatOut 4: Total Insanity sticks to some of it's Bugbear roots, while creating new ones. I still recommend the previous titles, compared to FlatOut 4 (except for FlatOut 3) This game is okay, but I still recommend this game, as the game is still enoyable, even with it's flaws.			"

												I was excited for a prospect of an actually decent new Flatout, but ""decent"" the most you can describe it as.It's worse than Flatout 2 and Ultimate Carnage in just about every aspect. In most it's only slightly worse, it's no Flatout 3, but ""better than Flatout 3"" is a hell of a low bar to clear. It feels like Flatout Lite – there is a sense that they tried to recreate the old ones, but it lacks their best and most fun aspects and moments.The driving is, put quite simply, not fun. The crashes lack any punch. I notice an opponent in front of me spin out and get sideways, nitro into him at full speed, and for that effort I'm rewarded with a plink which the game is happy to tell me was a ""great slam"". It actually felt like my car slowed down before the impact, as if to avoid the collision like I was playing full-assist mode in a circuit racer. The cars basically have three control types. All Derbies are understeering bricks, all Classics are spin-happy nitro machines, all Ultimates (or whatever the third one is) are 6x6 offroaders. None of the classes have any variety in character.Speaking of character, the cast of 7 (FO2) / 11 (FOUC) fun and varied opponents with actually different AI parameters have been replaced with two facial models caked in various forms of makeup, who drive exactly the same. Did they honestly think we wouldn't notice? Not that FO2/UC's opponents were some kind of RPG-esque well-written characters (they had a car set, a paragraph of bio, a ""photo"", a color scheme and some AI parameters tweaked), but this game manages to avoid even that.The Assault mode, which is essentially the only addition to this compared to FOUC, feels like a better fit in a kart game and has been better done in several of them.The music, after FO2 which basically defined my tastes for next 5 years and FOUC which, while not as impactful, still added a few bands to my notice list, is uninspired and lame. Most of the songs are in the genre of what I'd only call ""whine rock"".Even the graphics, which you'd think would be the one area where it's stupidly easy to improve after nine years are worse. Not from the technical standpoint, they've got the fancy reflections and godrays and whatever from the latest set, but it looks straight up worse because the environments are grey, the cars look dull, and the details are low-effort.Worst of all, this game gets boring. The races quickly become a grind. The stunts are a snorefest. (Seriously, how do you make flinging yourself into a Beer Pong cup uninteresting?) The derby is a succession of lame-feeling hits and watching the health bar go down.Maybe, if it was the only game in its genre, I'd be okay with it, as it has occasional cool moments and is, at the very least, competently made (as opposed to Flatout 3). But seeing as Flatout Ultimate Carnage is right nearby on Steam and ten times cheaper, there's just no point in buying this game.			"

												If you loved the orignal flatout games, then this is the game for you. It is a really well made game, and it fits well into the flatout formula. Feels like the old ones, but with udpated graphics. Very pleasant experience.			"

The GoodGraphicsOverall, the graphics are good. The textures, reflections, particles, bloom and subtle motion blur definitely work quite well together.The BadUIThe UI is obviously built for a console, and even with that said could still use work. The mouse doesn't work on any of the menus, which kinda sucks, but isn't a huge deal to me. My main problem with the UI is the reward claiming. It goes through each individual reward separately, which makes you want to spam the button to continue. This can cause you to accidently start up another championship/race. It's quite frustrating.AII feel the AI in this game really need some work. It can be pretty inconsistant and unpredictable with you either leading by 30 seconds or losing by 30 seconds. The characters also seem to be pretty bland. One of the things I really liked about the Bugbear FlatOuts was that each AI had their own ""personality."" Each character had their own background and driving style, making them more memorable and allowing you to actually have rivalries with them (Yes, I'm talking about you Lei Bing and Jack Benton)Lack of ContentFor the asking price of $33.99 (at the time of purchase (and yes, a friend did buy it for me)), the game really isn't worth it. The car list is pretty weak for current standards, there aren't many tracks and the campaign feels like too much of a grind. Hopefully the devs will release some free content updates in the future.The UglyVehiclesThe vehicles really seem out of place is most cases. Their proportions seem off, as well as their overall style. The cars really don't look like they belong in the same class. The different classes are basically just the same cars with different modifications and slightly faster, and the extra speed doesn't mix well with the tracks or AI.PhysicsOh boy, where to start. The people who worked on the tracks must have been completely cut off from the people who did the physics. The tracks are laid out pretty okay (some tracks could be better), but the physics really don't like them. Small bumps seem to be the hardest thing for the cars to handle, often ending in your car spinning out, flipping and bouncing off multiple walls. The wheels also seem to act like spheres rather than cylinders, causing your car to flip while randomly try to climb walls. Moving onto the stunt mode, the character ragdolls aren't, well, good. For example, I was playing the new Cup Pong mode and my ragdoll kept spazzing out and either bouncing out of the cup or just getting stuck in the side of it. The vehicle impacts also seem a bit buggy with small taps sending you from full HP to a sliver, making the derby modes really frustrating.PerformancePerformance is okay, but there are some pretty significant problems. The FPS holds up okay(ish) for most part, but there's a few hitches and a ton of stuttering no matter what visual settings are being used. With VSync off, the screen tearing is unbearable. But with it on, the FPS fluctuates all over the place, but is still surprisingly playable. There's also no other AA options except for FXAA which kinda sucks.The NeutralFeelingI had to make a separate ""Neutral"" section just for this. The way this game feels hits pretty close to home. It's trying to be a FlatOut game, but can't quite pull it off. If a few bugfix and content updates were to be released, then I feel this game could actually be pretty great. But still, there ain't no FlatOut like a Bugbear FlatOut.Is it a fun game? In my opinion, yeah. But in it's current state, I sadly can't recommend it mainly due to its price and lack of content.This review is still a WIP and I'll update it when necessary / when I get around to it.			"

												TL:DR - I'm nit-picky, the game is alright, but probably not worth $40.Flatout 4.... it's not bad, but it's not great either.As someone who still plays Flatout 2 somewhat regularly, my biggest gripe with the fourth installment in the series is that it's just too arcadey. ""But it's an arcade racer! It's supposed to be!"" I know. Let me elaborate.Flatout 1 and 2 were by no means simulation racers or even simcade racers (think GRID). But at their core, they were still grounded in reality (save for the driver ejection mechanic). The races were simply races. The cars weren't crazy or silly and they all made sense within their class. Derby cars were mostly used/junked race class cars, and the street cars were mostly just normal sports cars. In FO4, you find yourself racing:- An icecream truck- A modern sports car- A 50's sedanamong others, all within the Derby class. Sure they're junkers, but the wildly varying styles racing together leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Adding to FO4's silliness is the customizable nitro trail including confetti, bubbles, and money. This is completely optional but it feels more at home in Rocket League than Flatout. Additionally, FO4 features a car combat game mode that involves magically shooting oversized projectiles at other racers. Fun, but not really what I've come to expect from Flatout.However, the game is gorgeous. The driving mechanics are really solid (the crashes feel a little lame this time around though). And I really like the environment/track design. I wanted Flatout, but got the love child of Dirt: Showdown and Mario Kart.			"

												Great fun! I'm hooked! Out and out arcade racing at full speed. Awesome music, lovely graphics.. it's a return to form for Flatout.They nailed the vibe just right with this one, too.. the graphics, the UI and the licenced music (not generic electronica) really take it back to the atmosphere Flatout got right in the first place. When you're flying along at 100mph down a narrow country track, it feels awesome even if the physics aren't quite as good as Bugbears. The physics in Fla4out are not as realistic as the first two games and there are some glitches with the suspension going over tracks and such in this one, but for arcade fun these do really well and for the most part they're really fun driving. I'm not totally convinced they work very well in the derby modes, but hey there's so much to do in this game I don't mind having a few 'meh' bits in with the good.If you went away after Flatout 3, it's OK.. you can come back now :)			"

												Its leaps and bounds better than 3. It really is. It's still very rough though.Positives:Decent amount of carsCars can be upgradednew stuntsunlockable rocket trails and hornsIt actually feels like FlatOut.Negatives:If you slam into an NPC, they take very little damage (even if you hit them at 200+), yet if they hit you, it takes BIG chunks out. Yes, there's a stat that effects damage dealt, but this was truck V car, and the car won.If you try to push an NPC, well... You're better off trying to push a steam roller with a tricycle. They're massively heavier in their punch buggy than you are in your pickup truck.The flipping is real. hit any item heavier than a fence, and you'll roll. Get hit by a car, and you roll. Hit a small bump in the terrain, and you'll roll. I'm resetting my car almost as much as I'm driving.There aren't enough courses for the number of career races. You'll do the same track across all 3 series many times over. It becomes a grindfest.The cash gain feels low. Unless you're spending the entire race mashing the crap out of the NPCs, you won't get much money at all.The reward screens are punishing. you have to stare at your reward for a good 3-4 seconds each before you can move on, and you tend to get 2-6 rewards per cup. That's up to 1/2 a minute of just staring at text mashing enter just waiting for a chance to play again per cup. Worst part about it: you're mashing enter. as soon as you collect the last reward, you suddenly get back to menus with zero delay. What that means for you: you launch yourself into another race before you even realize you collected the final reward. Now you have to sit through TWO loading screens just to get back to the garage, like you haven't been waiting long enough in the first place. Almost as aggrevating as the AI.Overall a good game, brought down by artificial difficulty due to the AIs' weight/durability advantages and odd physics. Still a great game to play with friends though; the online portion isn't nearly as painful as single player. It's deffinately a leap in the right direction for the FlatOut series.			"

												This is absolutely NOT a FlatOut game.not a single thing about this game tells me its a FlatOut game. it is a fun game, but it IS NOT FLATOUTthe only thing that pisses me off about this game other than the lies about featuring assets from previous FlatOut games, is the horrible horrible character designs. if i wanted some ♥♥♥♥ ugly gmod avatar staring slightly to the left of me while i raced, id go play gmod. the character art was a special thing for me in the previous game, it gave the character personality. now ive got some army dude and a bunch of punk clowns with birth defects watching me while i drive.... theres not much customization at all other than stat based and preset car skins, nitro effects, and a horn (which is more than previous FlatOuts, but not worth using the word ""customizable"")not to mention, i bought the game right now rather than later because i saw i could get all the music for free.... it is NOT FlatOut style music. im not saying its bad, but not as good as FlatOut. so, i have no idea what people mean by this is a ""copy and paste of old FlatOut games"" because nothing here is from FlatOut. THAT SAID HERES A DISCLAIMER: i have, played, and still play the FlatOut titles by the original developer, Bugbear. Team6 threw away the FlatOut name, their games sucked. So if everything i said is false because theyre all assets from Team6's idea of FlatOut, then im very very sorry.... thats a sad sad story. which brings me back to ""This is NOT FlatOut"" because Team6 ate dirt.now i got that part out, the good part: its a decent game. ... ......... .............. thats all. yeah. ive enjoyed this half hour and will probably still be playing for a while. i like racing games, i like its style. just annoyed that its using the FlatOut brand without any connection to FlatOut at all. This reminds me of that NinjaTheory did to DMC. They didnt make a bad game, but they used an already successful name to make something else. Note to aspiring developers that want to make games in a series that already exists: STICK TO THE ♥♥♥♥ING FORMULA quit this whole ""make something new"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. rather than tarnishing the name, make something that can stand with its predecessors.Edit: after playing a bit... ♥♥♥♥ off. think im passed my point of refund. whatever. cleared derby with all golds and still not all derby cars unlocked, turns out you need to play flatout mode to unlock all cars aaand.... carnage is ♥♥♥♥ OFF especially with the car. coolest looking car = worst ♥♥♥♥ing handling. oh, the difficulty is also ramped by like 10 times. so all those cars i never got to know during campaign, found my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ real fast. yeah, i rage quit it. this is the 2nd company to fail at making a flatout game.

												If you wanna play same tracks and flip your car in same spot over and over again + buy highly overpriced game, go ahead. *Pro tip* You can buy it under 20e from other sites.There is oldschool stunt objectives, arenas etc but playing same races in every cup is a bit booring. Driving over railways with light car flips it everytime, you might crash out without reason etc.. It's fun for 10 hours and that's it.Oh, online is deeed.			"

												The game features a career mode with car purchases and upgrades; third-place finishes in each cup (a series of races on specific tracks) is required to unlock the next set. The FlatOut mode includes a mix of non-traditional game modes, and quick play and multiplayer modes are also available. In addition to traditional races, FlatOut 4 features assault races (with powerups), carnage races (where you score is based on damage caused), a variety of physics-based stunts (including long jump, high jump, golf, and curling), and destruction derby arena modes (including capture the flag). Causing destruction will award nitro, which can be used for quick bursts of acceleration. It is sometimes difficult to tell what is considered a “solid” object and what is not (Telephone poles? Destructible. Trees? Not). The handling is a bit loose, and there is occasionally questionable physics when hitting objects, causing spins that result in poor finishes. The AI is good enough for an arcade racer, piloting through each track appropriately and being aggressive with human drivers and other AIs. While not approaching the high mark set by FlatOut 2, FlatOut 4 is certainly a competent arcade racer and successfully eliminates the odorous smell left by FlatOut 3.

												I picked this game up on a whim and have been pleasantly surprised at just how much fun I have been having with it.  I highly recommend this game, as it is fun.Originally, my intent was to get some driving games to use my shiny new racing wheel and pedal accessory.  The steering wheel works well-enough in this game, but a controller is, honestly, a better fit, withthe exception that I still prefer to use my racing wheel and pedals on Time Trials.I have never played any other Flatout titles, so I cannot compare, but I am not biased either.I have come to view this game as a more realistic and more grown-up version of a certain Kart game that involves plumbers, anthropomorphic turtles, and gluttonous dinosaurs.You race in your car through various tracks, complete cups, unlock further cups and higher difficulty levels, and there is even a mode that gives you various offensive tools you can use against your opponents, which I thoroughly enjoy.The other racers are all distinct, and, after playing and racing against them a while, I have noticed that they have certain tendencies, which is pretty cool.  Some of them are focused on speed and being in front, and will usually compete with you heavily on the Fastest Lap Time, others are aggressive bulldozers and will do their best to knock you silly.  Some are insanely reckless, you will see them stomping their Nitro hard and then will, invariably, see them spinning through the air in a spectacular crash, while some are much more careful and you can actually learn from them by following them and seeing how they handle the trickier parts of the track.The tracks are also fantastic!  There is not a hige number of them, but you will race them forward and backward.  While that may seem insignificant, it does make a great difference and will absolutely make it a completely new track for you.  Each track has varied paths throught it, some are the shortest, some are the least cluttered, and you must be quick to decide whether you want to take a shortcut and gamble on your driving abilities, or go to a path apart from other racers to build up some momentum.The physics really impress me.  The crashes feel meaty and if you mess up and slam into the wall you will definitely feel it.  Hitting other cars is also satisfying, especially if it is the jerk that has constantly slammed into you on a previous run and caused you to go from first to tenth due to a spin out or slamming into the wall.  The different conditions require adjustment too, driving through mud on a rainy day is vastly different than driving it without the rain, which is where the different vehicles come into play.There are quite a few vehicles to buy and upgrade in career mode.  You can have volkswagen beetle like buggies, pickup trucks, caddilacs, jeeps and others.  Each one has its own strengths and weaknesses.  The pickup truck is very good at taking punishment, has a decent top speed and is generally rather stable, however it is slow on acceleration and its inertia may work against you from time to time as you slam headfirst into a pile of rocks.  The Jeep is my nemesis, I appreciate that is it a very fast, stable, and overall great car, but it is tiny and overturns at a stiff breeze, it is definitely a car for a much more skilled driver than I.There are many different game modes, from career, which will have you race, do destruction derby, and time trials, to Flatout Mode which assigns you a car and gives you a specific ruleset.  Either do a stunt, such as flinging your driver out the windshield into a baseball bat, or drive fast to try to prolong the inevitability of exploding, or Carnage mode which is a ""race"" technically, but you are gauged on how much chaos you cause to scenery and other drivers, with your position in the race serving only as a multiplier to your points.  Destroying a fence when first will get you many more points than when twelfth.Overall, this game is amazing, I wish more was done by marketing to get the word out, because this game is incredibly fun. p.S.  I cannot comment on multiplayer as I do not have much interest in it myself, but the prospect is an intriguing one and I will definitely give it a whirl one day.UPDATE:  i have recently switched over to playing the game exclusively with steering wheel and pedals, and the experience is even better now.

FlatOut is back!Well, actually FlatOut 2 is back, and on steroids, too! After the atrocious FlatOut 3 (which may have put off a lot of people) I can happily state that FlatOut 4 is everything the FlatOut 2 fan can whish for, and all that with modern graphics and physics. If you are a fan of rough and fast arcade crash racing, you will find no better. Get it!			"

												I'll get to the point.  Recommended?  Yes.  But that comes with some caveats.  See below:Good:- Its a return to Flatout 2 & Ultimate Carnage.  Its quick, and its fun to play.- Some of the new stunts are fun, once you unlock them :| (flatout mode below)- Graphics are well done, as is the sound.- The addition of track modes: assault (gain powerups and nitro from ramming others) & carnage (as much scenery as possible) add a different spice to races.- Steam workshop support will soon be active, theoretically meaning an increase in community generated tracks/vehicles(?) after release.Not So Good:- The career mode is a grind.  - Flatout mode is also a grind- A greater range of tracks would have been nice.- There appears to be an absence of a ""tournament"" mode to play multiple stunts/tracks together in one go.- No stunts initially in online MP.- Derby matches (apart from CTF) are a mixed bag.- The music is a bit cheesy in parts, but thats probably to be expected.Conclusion:I've dropped some time into it, and its proving entertaining.  Is it worth the US$40?  Its a judgement call.  For people who have been missing a Flatout fix its worth it.  Alternatively, wait for a sale :)			"

												How you can see i only played the game for 20minutes. But there are a few things i can say about this game right now.1. All in all it LOOKS like a good game. - Menu is good- driving physics is good- many gamemodes2. BUT the game has totally failed at giving feedback to crashes, nitro etc.- when you use nitro, the screen just totally freaks out and vibrates (i set vibration to zero), so u cant really control where u are driving at or, more important u cant really crash someone.- when u crash someone (which we all really want and love because of FO 2) it just vibrates and nothing else really happens. No crash sound, no chipping carpartikels, no healthbar which decreases in a satisfying way. (all these things made FlatOut 2 so great). (It was these absolutly satisfying crash feedback u got when u crashed something in FO 2)else:. Games these days try to impress with their great graphics and stuff. But i thing a simple graphics would be much better. What i mean is, i just think everything looks awefull. Just Open FlatOut 4 and then FlatOut 2. FO 2 just looks soo much nicer. So when they would change these things, it would be a great game.			"

												 The Friends I have made over the last ten years and beyond always enjoyed our Friday Night Stunts in both the orginal Flatout and Flatout Carnage series. I can tell you that we all waited in anticipation for this game to release with the hopes of  having stunts of old and new. I am not disappointed. I can see us having another great 10yrs of fun in this game not only in the stunts but also the racing. Bang up job and highly recommend purchasing this game, it will not disappoint, but remember to bring a few friends along and compete with them in both the racing and stunt features.			"

												While it may merely be a nostalgic throwback for those that have fond memories of predecessors of the series and personallly your typical arcadey desctrution derby game from the PS2-era, it certainly knows what it is and does a generally god job of it.It is a bit stupid in some ways, but surely entertaining at the same time. It has a pretty good and certainly appropriate licensed soundtrack that you are likely to expect from this kind of game. A set of decent looking tracks, with plenty of different routes and stuff to break along the way and most of them offer a good variety of game modes; from simple races to destruction derbys and stunt events of different kinds. The characters that make out your oppostion are certainly related to the previously mentioned PS2-style driving games as well.The career mode makes for some enticing progression on various maps with most of the modes included. The AI leaves something to be wished for in places, but does a decent enough job for the most part. The price may be a bit high for what is an essential remake with slightly more content, but it is likely woth getting if you have some nostalgic feel for these kind of games.			"

												Great game, feels like a copy-paste of the old games but with new content, even the menus are similar!Crash feedback doesn't feel quite right and the damage models are very hit or miss, depending on the vehicle.Licensed songs with lyrics, so no very low budget generic rock tracks here.It has a new gamemode somewhat similar to mario kart, which is chaotic at best and messy at worst.After the mess that was Flatout 3 I didn't expect to ever see another good Flatout game, and while this isn't as amazing as Ultimate Carnage, it's still a very good surprise coming from a studio with no past experience in these type of games.If you're a Flatout fan this game is for you; a near carbon copy of the first 2. Also Allstar vehicle class looks FREAKING AWESOME! Like it came out of a zombie movie.My only real gripe with this game is that the devs apparently hired the most incompetent marketing team ever. "

I'm now getting a warm, fuzzy FlatOut feeling whilst playing this 4:TH and latest installment. Once again great ball breaking driving combined with an awesome fitting soundtrack (I opted for the 3 additional DLC soundtracks). Good tracks, stunts and tricks.			"

												Well as a big fan of flatout 2.. I must say when I saw the trailer I was excited, yet very aware this could be a giant let down..Lets start out with the cons.Car skins  (they either are extremely goofy or super super sporty.. think GTR and an icecream truck)Lack of advertisement for the game (Only happened to come across this on upcoming racer games online searches)if you get in an accident in the game on certain maps, if you fly off the track and into said building that looks like its inthe distance.. you fly through it and respawn. (not a big deal imo, but still something I've noticed)The impact of other cars as it is mightily satisifying still to T-bone somebody.. The collision sounds could be a bit better, as flatout 2 had it.Anyways, the Pros here1. Game runs flawless if you turn on V-sync (I believe it is a must, without it ran a lil choppy going from 200 fps (cap) to 150 in certain spots2. The maps are absolutely beautiful and extremely well done, you can see where their time has obviously gone.. and it does not fall on closed eyes.  Well done3. The maps have many MANY different routes when you compare them to flatout 2, which was one of my favorite aspects of that game.4. That insane nitrous feeling is amazing when you are blitzing thru these well-made maps.  It is a lot of fun5. It is full of good laughs with your friends which seems it will have countless hours written all over it.6. The cars sound absolutely amazing.. Granted some of them don't match, but what are you really going to make an icecream truck sound like, besides a ♥♥♥♥in monster of a beast. ;)Overall I think this game has been a good purchase so far and I hope people aren't blinded by their hatred for the past flatouts to overlook this one.  It is well done and hopefully these guys continue to update it!!You very well could be seeing the start of a new racing game through these guys.			"

												As a big fan of Flatout 1, 2 & Ultimate Carnage I really like it but WHY? WHY couldn't you have made stunts on-line multiplayer? I've always played Ultimate Carnage stunts mode on 360 with a group of friends and the thought that I could finally play it, even when they're not availble, with many different people, was really exiting. I like it overall but that's really disapointing.			"

												This Game is all in all Fun but not really a wothy sucsessor to the parts from Bugbear but that is to be expected as they made it rather special.The stunt events are however harder than usual as the physics are less tolerant to errors and the ragdolls tend to spaz in one event. (Longjump)A preference thing are the enemy drivers where as in the earlier they where more like people who want to participate in a Bangerrace here there is more of a Carmageddon aura with them.			"

												Pretty enjoyable arcade racer. Controls feel responsive, graphics and performance are pretty good and all the classic game modes are there along with a few new ones. However, it could benefit from tighter physics and a bit more track variety. Also the characters aren't as fun/memorable as in previous games.Not as good as 2, but not as bad as 3. Overall I'd say it's a decent addition to the FlatOut series, and remains loyal to what made the first few games fun to play.Not bad for a new developer's first time at FlatOut. Definitely better than the stuff we've been getting from Bugbear recently.			"

												FlatOut 4 is a fun enough game but not perfect by any means.  My main gripe about this game is how easy it is to spin out of control, infact you might as well call it SpinOut 4 because that my experience in almost every race.  Hit a jump, car hits ground and spins around, hit railroad tracks, car spins out, hit some random object in the road, spin out, it happens a lot.  Another frustrating thing is hitting AI cars sometimes.  I hit a car, they end up going sideways and bring me completely to a stop. They hit me I get dragged for several seconds and can't respawn until coming to a complete stop.Minus the complaints I do still have fun with the game, and it runs great on a GTX 1070 at 1440p, with no game crashes, just lots of car crashes.

												BEFORE YOU BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM!!!!!I bought my copy through another store for $16 and lemme tell ya, it was an amazing game for THAT price.  This game totally makes up for the fail that Flatout 3 was to the series.  This game almost brought the series back to life.  It features the standard racing types: Derby, Racing, and Street, (least to a point) and the stunts of course.  I've only played 30 mins of it (enough to win 2 derby cups and try a few stuns out) and I am very satisfied with this game.  I will be playing this game again to look forward to beating it and playing online with a couple people.  Very nice game, but not for $40.			"

												The destruction feels more real than ever, cars go from brand new to a bunch of scrapped metal.It's not about getting there first, but about how much damage you deal. Almost anything can be torn to pieces, from a simple box to a house and not to mention the cars.It has new really cool modes, the weather changes the rules of the levels and there are cars that look like they came straight out of a Mad Max movie.

												If you like slamming and pushing other drivers off the road, the new Flatout is probably not for you.It's overall a really OK racing game but unlike in previous titles (or, true Flatout titles which are all released prior to 3) the physics engine is really bad. You can still destroy street signs and what not but slamming other drivers feels really bad - there is just no force to it. When I hit someone's rear with 200kmh in Flatout 2 I could be certain they won't bother me again any time soon. In Flatout 4, however, when you hit someone's rear at 200kmh, their car slightly jumps and you see a few sparks - that's it. In the best case, they lose control over their car but nothing more. Maneuvers like that are REALLY dangerous as most of the time other drivers will just ""shrug you off"" and you will suddenly find yourself losing control of your own car while they just continue racing as if nothing happened. Same goes for trying to push other drivers off the road - it's like they are driving on rails.tl;dr: Flatout 4 is not that bad of a game but if you are that kind of person that likes to fully slam into an opponent that has just overtaken you, you won't have a good time with it.
