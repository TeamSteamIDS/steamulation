Quiz Night Tonight - Star in your own quiz show and let your friends laugh at your lack of knowledgeFirst up it should be noted that i am the type of person who hides when mates pull out the trivial pursuit board, having a less than ideal memory and a disregard for sports in general has not prepared me for such games (load up titanfall and i will wipe the floor with you (or at least have a lot of fun and not care if i lose), that is my area of expertise. However i am always happy to reach out of my comfort zone and try new things, it is the only way you find new and great games.This is essentially a quiz show experience game,There are multiple modes but according to the instructions some require you to have a ps4 control pad attached to your pc (could be an error in the instructions, but would be weird for a pc game to accidently reference a console control pad, being unwilling to connect my ps4 pad to my pc (and not owning ps move controller) i skipped these modes. The actual trivia was not too bad, there was a lot of questions on american sports that the average non us geek is never going to know but you also have comic book, films and animals.ROOMSCALE / ENVIRONMENT There are multiple environments of differing quality,*It should be noted that throughout the whole of the game there was an issue with the floor (see performance further below).The main lobby: very bland area and could do with sprucing up especially since when waiting for a multiplayer game this is where you will spend your time.The Knowledge race arena: Looked somewhat rushed, it works but i do not believe it to be of finished quality (if this was an early access title i could overlook this and assume it was a place holder, but it looks like something quickly made in a few minutes in unity) just felt very amature especially when compared to the next one. Trivia main room: So this one i left till last, it is clearly the one the dev has spent the most time on and looks absolutely great it feels like you are in a good quiz show set, the addition of the camera that went around looking at other players (bots in my test) and throws them up on the big screens above the centre was a very nice touch, i hope the dev revisits the other areas and adds this much time on them.*Its worth noting that despite my capture software deciding it did not want to record game audio, there is your generic quiz show music playing which worked well and did not get annoying (might do after a few hours)GRAPHICS On the whole not too bad, this is rather irrelevant for this type of game, while the environment matters the most, the actual elements inside them are more dressing for the environment than your usual game assets.PERFORMANCE Here we come to a big snag, when i loaded in i was about 2 meters off the floor. I test of the steam load space confirmed it was right, advanced settings floor fix did not fix, and loading another game showed the issue was not my end but a bug in the game.In terms of frame rate/stuttering etc there was no issues at all.INTUITIVENESS There is an instructions option in the main lobby and at no point did i really feel too out of place as to what to do. (if i was at the correct height i may of been even quicker with the uptake lol)MULTIPLAYER: This is where a game like this would shine but sadly there is not enough players i gave it a very small amount of time in the video to wait for other players but i also checked steam charts which showed the game has very few people playing it. Do not buy it for the multiplayer.There are however bots and they make a fun competition to play against.PROS:  Bots. Really well made Trivia mode area. More geeky questions added than your average trivia board game.CONS:  All but the Trivia area are somewhat amature. Needs a playstation pad for some modes (according to the instructions) Not enough people to play online with. (i would suggest a massive price reduction for a limited time) Too many usa sport questions (i would suggest that the developer adds the ability to turn certain categories on or off)The first try video:

			First try of Quiz night tonight! a vr quiz game that can be played in vr or outside (i ofcourse opted for the vr mode :) ) #QNT Steam link: http://store.steampowered.com/app/549280/ Review Link:...		

VERDICT I am going to recommend the game but only if you like trivia games and do not mind playing against bots. The issues i have with the game in its current state can be fixed and to be honest, apart from the height issue, they do not takeaway the enjoyment of the main Trivia mode. It is however priced a little too high for attracting many users. Certainly not a glowing recommendation but since steam gives us the black and white Yes or No i am going to assume you are looking at this game as you are interested in trivia games and say yes.			"

												Feels like being on a game show! Obviously this is the sort of game that needs an online player base and i played against bots. Mind you, they're bots with a pretty decent knowledge of American football, something I and most people outside continental US know nothing about. Maybe more questions everyone has a chance of knowing.  I played the two versions of  trivia and not the Ball Room or Jigsaw Puzzler but look forward to going up against fellow quiz players.			"

												I gotta say this is a nice vr thing to do!there are two side games but besides that you dont have to use movements in the two general modes, its really fun to play.I tried to play online but couldn't find enough players, this game can also be played without vr, so hopely in the future this will get a nice publicThe questions you have to answer are from historical, and about very recent things or people to, its not always easy to answer on the sport questions if you are from a different country. i got second place against AI and im not american :D
