												Here's how to install it: Copy the below link to your browser's address bar, hit Go/Enter and allow your browser to redirect the request to Steam, should it ask.Steam will now queue an update for the DLC that you'll have to start manually by switching to your downloads page. Once started, it should now download & install the addon as once intended.The link: steam://run/8670			"
