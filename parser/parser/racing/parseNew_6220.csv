												Maybe one of the most under-rated racing game series. This game is made by Finnish studio called ""Bugbear Entertaiment"" known as of Flatout Series (expect Flatout 3 chaos & destruction which was awful game made by some studio from Czech) Rally Trophy, Ridge Racer Unbounded and future release ""Next Car Game"" what is upcoming game to new generation consoles and pc (people voted from greenlight for steam). Even Though game is from 2005 this game have ""heavenly"" physics motor and driving response system when it is considered its racing game era back to that time. Simple & very challenging single player career. 8 player AI-races, 16 different cars what you can customise, 48 different tracks including Demolition derbys, Bonus and stunt tracks and all tracks contains hundreds of destructible pieces. Multiplayer is closed but still working with downloadable patch from net. Sorry for my bad english!LEGENDARY GAME 10/10			"

												Don't get decieved by a relatively low score on Metacritic, that's unfortunately a result of reviewers comparing FlatOut to Need For Speed (most popular racing game of mid-2000's). Although they belong to the same main genre, racing, they are completely different games with completely different perception of racing.I played this game for the first time when it was released in 2005 but I was not able to get pass through the first stage of three as I was not that good in PC games back then. I grew up, saw this game on discount and I was determined to complete this after all those years and finally managed to complete the game in 15 hours.During 15 hours, I completely lost my s**t, I leaned right or left on my chair while I was simply pressing left and right buttons on my cheap keyboard, I looked for a brake pedal under the desk, I felt like I won a real race after each race. This is probably one of the most underrated games of all times as it's gaming mechanics, AI, graphics are better than current era of arcade racing games.FlatOut reminded me why I loved racing genre. 10/10.

												I had the good fortune way back in 2004 while I was at Gencon to walk by the Nvidia booth (who was showcasing the brand new 6800 Ultra), and the title they where using was this facinating dirt racing game.  I was blown away by the damage modeling which at the time looked amazing, considering the best compairison was GTA3.So I looked into this crazy title by a studio that no one had heard of, and found out that it was still in beta.  I probebly put 20 hours into the demo/beta before it was announced that it was going gold, but didnt have a publisher in the US.  So I ordered it directly from Germany.  Honestly, a fantastic older game.  It feels right, with cars all handeling a little different, and convaying a great sense of speed and weight.  And the party games are far too much fun.  I have bought it twice now, and I cant recommend this enough.			"

												FlatOut was released on November 5, 2004 for both Windows and Consoles. My first impressions of the game were also back then. The game was fun. But now, it can only be played for nostalgia. I suggest you pick it up on a sale. I said that the game was fun because there are better games out there that you can buy. This game made a good start for the derby racing game and started a future for FlatOut series. I still find it amazing how the driver just flies out of the window during big crash. The gave is hilarious especially if you play with friends. But I am not too sure if the game servers are even running. I know you can play with friends via some LAN programs or even HOTSEAT. It's a good game to have fun with. As in any racing game there must be music in this one. It has a decent soundtrack for the time of release, but I have personally never heard those bands in my life before or after. I do not dislike the soundtrack but I think it could have been much better. The rest of the sound effects seem fine and nothing particular caught my eye( or more like ear).  2004 was a big year for very good looking games. This game didn't do too bad compared to big fish around that time. Car detail is good. The detail of the maps is good as well. Human rag dolls are a bit on the low side, but they are not that important. Overall, I am still very happy with the graphics to the current time.

Controls and overall steering is a bit funny. I take it that's because the game was made for consoles too. There are not many buttons to press, but powerful steering can ruin your race.

There are a few things, of course, that I quite hate about FlatOut. First thing is AI. It's so straight forward that it's actually not fun playing against computer. All it wants is to reach the finish line. I can also add that AI drives in the best possible way and will not crash. All other reasons add up to the first one. Because the AI drives really well, one mistake on the map could mean that you have lost your lead, quite probably for the rest of the match. And the last thing is that in my opinion the cars get damaged way too fast even without actually crashing into anything. But the end of the match you will end up having engine on fire, 2 car seats with human and skeleton of the car.

Re-playability is low in my opinion, because you can just play other better games with the same name. So in overall, I think this game (without considering the rest of the series at least) is quite good. I would recommend it simply because it's really fun. Not everywhere you can send the driver flying out.			"

												This game may be old, but that does not take away from the fact that it's one of the best racing games I have ever played. The creativity in it is absolutely amazing, something I have never seen before in any game. The only complaint I have about this game is that there isn't anyone playing multiplyer on it anymore, which is a shame since this game is still so good. Overall I'd recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun, addictive racing game to pass time with.			"

												FlatOut 1 physics *ARE* much more realistic than FlatOut 2!Problem is, most kiddies (and adults) don't have a clue of how a powerful RWD car handles, and then stupidly trash this game physics.I grew up driving a powerful rear-wheel drive muscle car - Chevrolet Opala 250 - about the same as one of a mid line 70's camaro, and I can tell that the handling in this game is very realistic and similar, in sand and on asphault (no real experience on snow driving, though)But yeah, Bugbear introduced a few arcade elements, using the engine of their previous RACING SIMULATOR game... Arcade elements: All objects are somewhat light and the car tends to stay wheels down.Writing this to counter-act so many arcade kiddos trashing this. Give something closer to a simulator to an arcade kiddie, he won't even be able finish the race after the first stage hahaha			"

PROS:+ great racing experience+ awesome soundtrack+ lots of race tracks+ many crazy modes of play (bowling, highjump, etc.)+ whacky car crashes+ decent car selection & customization+ fun multiplayerCONS:- LAN only multiplayer- car customization could be a bit more polished- some repetitive challenge types- weird AI difficulty balanceComment:Ah, the original FlatOut. This game was great back then and time has not taken anything away. I used to play this game with my friends at dorm LAN parties and we loved it. It is simple but hits that racing sweet spot of really fun gameplay. FlatOut doesn't take itself seriously like other racing games but instead opts for solid racing levels and whacky exibition courses. Even today it looks great and gives you that raw destruction derby racing feel. Oh yeah, it also has ACTUAL destruction derby in the exhibition courses. The AI feels sometimes strange, ranging from stupid to godly. Therefore you will enjoy the game mostly in multiplayer where it is loads of fun! The downside is that there is only LAN play and so you either have to simulate LAN or actually have real physical friends in your location. Overall a fantastic old game that is worthwhile and I recommend it!			"

												A classic title from Bugbear Entertainment, FlatOut 1 is a racing game where you race scrapped-up derby cars around some tracks, to win, like any other racing game. However, unlike more realistic titles on Steam, this game seems to play more around dirty racing, such as slamming into your opponents, ramming them or pushing them into telephone poles. Flatout doesn't take itself seriously, however, with the special events. I won't spoil them all, but they include such things as darts and a high jump. With your driver's body. Yeah, it was one of the first racing games to incoporate ragdoll physics and it plays this for laughs, especially when, if faced with a hard enough impact, your driver just FLIES out of the car.Xbox controller support is okay, and it's a title that feels like it should be played with one. It's hardly taxing on modern hardware, and it runs pretty smooothly on laptops. Honestly, give it a try, it's pretty enjoyable for the price!			"

												I can't honestly say that this is a good racing game. Not only has it not aged well, but even when it came out, it was generic at best and abysmal at its worst, as a racing game. As a stunt game, it's phenominal. Throwing the driver from the driver's seat is probably one of the most fun and original ideas to come out of a car game like this. I played this long before it was ever on Steam, so my gameplay hours are not accurate.Either way, if you're looking for a good racing game, keep looking, as this is pretty average, but if you want something to crash cars and do fun stunts with, absolutely worth looking into, especially if it's on sale.

												FlatOut is a fast and fun racing game released in 2005. Since it's almost 10 years old, the graphics obviously show it's age personally I did not mind a bit. However, without controller support, steam achievements and online players, you probably want to look somewhere else and If you own one of the new FlatOut games you don't really need this one.The only reason for you to get this game is if you are low on cash and want to pick this one up in a Steam sale (atm it's 1,75 euro).I will still recommend this game because it was pretty good when it launched.

												A lot of people seem to be writing nostalgia reviews (to the point where ""nostalgia"" is not only the main theme, but also the only noun present in the whole review). So here's a newcomer's take for a change.Flatout is many things, but firstly and foremostly it's a racing game. You buy a car, you race AI opponents, get money to buy upgrades, or better cars. Complimenting that you have various ridiculous - but apparently quite iconic - events, which range from demolition derby to a variant of darts where you crash your car into a solid obstacle at speed to hurl yourself through the windshield and onto a gigantic net which serves as the dartboard.The events, as popular among the fans as they seem, didn't really catch my attention - there's not really enough substance or strategy to any of them to please this Nofun McGee. No, I'm looking for nothing but pure driving, and flying through the windshield doesn't count as driving in my book.That's why I found Flatout really grating at first, even in the race mode. The game just loves putting a ton of heavy obstacles specifically where they belong the least, and this is not helped by the fact that you never wear your seatbelt, and that most tracks take place on very slippery surfaces, usually dirt, but if the game hears you complaining it will gladly offer some snow instead. Stomp your foot in despair and get ice. Little did it know, I'm not the type to get easily discouraged, but that didn't prevent it from keeping screwing me over. Once you learn how to powerslide slippery turns, it will ""admit defeat"" and give you asphalt tracks, where you have so much grip it feels weird, and makes you crash like never before. And then it goes urban, where against all racing game logic you crash into curbs as you try to navigate twisting streets at a speed, absolutely blocked from cutting any corners, and then it mixes it up with dirt roads so you have to switch between dirt thinking to asphalt thinking on the fly.If this all sounds kinda like a rally game, that's because Flatout kinda is a rally game. A rally game crossed with Burnout, where you have a boost gauge that increases by crashing into stuff, and opponents to crash into. The weird thing is that unlike Burnout, obstacles in Flatout aren't made of crepe paper. They are very solid, and as I said, you wear no seatbelt. At the same time, just like Burnout, you get boost from demolishing them. This might seem counter-productive at first, but in practice it means you can afford to screw up every now and then since it gives you a little bit of boost to compensate a little bit of lost time, unlike Burnout where screwing up isn't a big deal, boost is essentially free and is used to stay ahead of rubberbanding AI just before the finish line. Speaking of which, Flatout AI does not rubberband, and yet is still competitive. I know, right?Speaking of your opponents, in order to keep ahead of them you have to keep souping your car up. However, while the game does allow you to do some modifications that some other developers who aren't really into cars would never think of implementing, such as upgrading the exhaust for actual performance purposes rather than cosmetic, or the engine's flywheel to make it linger at high revs for longer, generally there's no real depth to the whole upgrade system. You just buy the upgrades one after another as they come, and the end result is basically a faster and more responsive car. There's no way to screw anything up. Can't say it doesn't do wonders for mass appeal, but I'd prefer a little bit more involved system, just adjusting suspension tightness with sliders and such would do, just to make my car really mine. That could also be helped with better cosmetic options than just 5 crappy paintjobs for each car, then again you're basically racing rustbuckets on dirt roads, not shiny chrome monsters in the streets of Tokyo.Towards the end of the game I was already mastering the roads, perfectly cornering in tandem with AI, never crashing and generally having a blast, much of which is credited to the options menu and it's cooperation in turning the music down. However, there came an overwhelming feeling of joyful sadness, like when you're done watching a really good movie and you're like ""man I wish I could watch that again,"" when you remember that you can, except this is even better, because for your second run the game has an optional realistic mode that makes physics a lot more challenging.I was never happier flying through windshields before.

												Летящий из-под колес песок и грязь, облака пыли, искры из-под чиркнувшего о дорогу глушителя создают ни с чем не сравнимую атмосферу гонок на выживание. А вот задний план, по крайней мере на данный момент, проработан не лучшим образом. Хотя времени на то, чтобы полюбоваться закатом или зеленой рощицей у вас не будет – соперники просто не позволят отвлечься от дороги. Довольно сообразительный и хитрый AI не простит вам ни одной ошибки. Хотя и ему не чуждо человеческое поведение. Тот же искусственный соперник, минуту назад лихо обошедший вас на вираже, спустя пару минут может зазеваться и оказаться в канаве с оторванным колесом.

												A classic arcade racing game! Whilst the music was not quite my taste, the rest of the game was quite enjoyable. It's an old game, so don't expect any flash graphics. What this does mean, though, is that it will run on pretty much every modern system flawlessly (though I did have the occassional minor audio glitch where the music would disapper for half a second). The game boasts environmental destruction as well as car destruction and ragdoll physics (for when your character flies out of your car!!). The career contains 36 different tracks as well as some bonus material (e.g. Destruction Derby), and the variety of cars and upgrades for those cars is a nice addition too. Overall, the game is worth getting if you're a fan of arcade racing games. You'll have a lot of fun! Enjoy! :D			"

												This is definitely one of my favorite racing games of all time, simply just for how close it brought my brother and I to passing out just from laughter alone back when we were still in school. Seeing it now brings back plenty of memories!It plays pretty smoothly, the soundtrack is just as rockin' as I remember, watching someone fly through their windshield and crash into your car still has that special charm even after so many years, but, above all, nothing beats driving your twisted metal wreck across the finish line at the end of a race and STILL take first place~Man, good times with a good game			"

												This game even though it is a DIRECT port off of the PS2 (meaning nothing has changed except the controls. You can't even use the letters on your keyboard to type your name for a save file! You must move the cursor over to each letter), is still an amazing game for as long as it's been out. I remember buying it on the PS2 thinking it was just going to be another lame racing game, and was VERY wrong! It mixes difficulty with strategy to make the game fun (if you like a challenge like me), it has soft-body physics (when you crash into something your car bends to meet the damage unlike Need For Speed or Gran Turismo), and you can play Olympic games with your car! There is a long jump, high jump, curling, bowling, skiball, and even darts! You play these games by driving your car and ejecting yourself out of your windshield causing yourself to do awesome stuff! The question I'm asking myself is, who WOULDN'T buy this for $7? I personally say it should be worth at least $10 or $15 for all the original stuff and work the creators put into this... It's seriously underpriced in my book. So what are you waiting for? There's a demo, try it!			"

												I've played this game a lot over the years. I love it. It's simple and really not very difficult. But that's good. The real fun comes in later when you know the tracks well enough that you can start to really shave those valuable hundredths off your time, and start to invent your own games, like letting all the other cars lap you, then seeing if you can unlap yourself again to win. What? I told you I'd played it a lot. :PIt's not 100% perfect of course. When your driver flies out of the car and hits trees, he kinda gets a little stuck and turns into Stretch Armstrong for a second. The replay function after each race could have used more options, like the option to edit multiple cameras together, and then save the replay to view later or share. The tracks are reused quite extensively - a few more would have been nice. And among other little things, being able to race any track in the opposite direction would have added just a little bit more replayability to it.Overall, it's hard to fault this game for what it is - a simple, yet highly fun and addictive racing game. :)			"

I wasn't into racing games.I never liked them.Someday, a long long time ago, in a cold winter day, I decided to buy this game (1,19€). A few months earlier, I haggled with a friend because of Burnout; I was hating racing games. I bought it just to complete my library. However, I tried it aaaaaaaaand ...... guess what ...... loved it. It's the only racing game i ever liked. If you don't manage to win the race, you can f♥♥♥ it and just explore the out-road map: there is a lot of it. If you don't manage to win the race, you can f♥♥♥ it and just smash all the things you see: you'll get the same amount of money (if you smash enough things, of course). The trees are ∞∞∞∞∞ stronger than the:  bulldozers cranes excavators  telegraph poles pretty much everything   No matter how hard you try, you can't destroy your car. Even if it is burning, you have the same yield as the car you start the game with. Never trust the ramps (especially the wooden ramps). They will bring you only pain and anger. Very good songs.   It's a great game, BUY it.			"

												The amazing thing about FlatOut is that you don't need rose tinted glasses to enjoy the game even after more than 12 years after its release.Some people seem to think that FlatOut is about destruction and destruction only - but players looking for a challenging racing game (with Nitro and collisions sprinkled on top) will definitely be satisfied with the game!

												While this game is very fun, it does have it fair share of problems. In some ways it feels a bit dated, but at the same time it holds up quite well. Which is not that surprising for a game that came out in 2005. The controls really make and break this game. They are very floaty and extremely clunky. It basically feel like you're controlling a jetski in rough waters. When on tarmac, it feels good. You can drift around corners and speed through light curves and it feels like a great arcade racer. When you drive on snow and off-road on the other hand, you're sliding all over the place and have little to no control. Almost slowing down completely before big corners in order to handle them. And the AI cars will drift through like zen masters. Which is another problem with this game. The AI. There's not much rubberbanding in this game. If one of the AI cars end up ahead of the pack, then their perfect path finding will leave you in the dust. You can never catch up. I had the fastest car with all upgrades, and they still sped ahead of me. This game is about crashing your opponents to get ahead, and then keep the lead. And if you crash yourself, you're forced to a 4 second slow-mo crash sequence, and when it ends you're put back quite a while. Usually last place. There's also a reset button. It works when prompted, and some other times as well. When you've been pushed off track and facing the wrong way though, it will most likely not work. You don't decide when to reset, Flatout does. But when it all comes together (usually the tarmac tracks) this game is incredibly fun. But the other aggravations kept me from finishing this game. I beat the bronze and silver tracks, but I had to give up at the gold tracks. After resetting a track 20 times because the AI kept using the PIT maneuver to turn me the wrong way, I gave up. That's where the fun ended for me. But for the price and for the hours I put in, I can't complain. I will recommend this game, but be aware that it definitely has its shortcomings. But then again, it's also a 9 year old game.			"

												Great game, played it back when it came out on CR-ROM. For 75p I thought I'd buy it on Steam and play a bit for old times sake.I forgot how bad PC games used to be with controller configuration. It's not quite as simple as plugging an Xbox controller in and playing like the newer games.Once that it sorted though it is still fun doing the long jump with the driver of your car after chucking him through the front window.9.5/10			"

												Flatout was a game that I bought on the Playstation 2 back when it came out in 2004. I still play it, as the destruction is always entertaining. Even if you've beaten the game, you can go back and drive races in the opposite direction, or explore the edges of the map. If you like cars and are a little out of the box, then this game is for you.			"

I always loved it more than the later versions cause it seemed to have better physics, cars tend to act like they should.One time if i was racing against my friends... o my this game was once our LAN's most played game; i accidentally (think i hit something) shot my driver out of my car and the ragdoll flew against my friends car.That incident just went crazy and triggered my friends ragdoll to fly out of his car after was on contact with my ragtoll :DThat's just one story of many cool things what may happen in this game.Total recommendation from me.
