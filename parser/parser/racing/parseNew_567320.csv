								This is a parkour game! and I love parkour games :)This means: * You will probably fail on your first run of a level. * You will fail after that a lot as well till you figured out how to do all the jumps to get to the goal! * You will need to figure out where you have to go. * There will be always a shorter path than you know of. * Every round/run will help you to become better and faster in the current level. * Be ready to press that restart button of the parcour a lot of times! ('r' for restart, 't' for last checkpoint)What I like: + Challenging Levels + A button to quickly restart the level + different jumping mechanisms (wall jumps, rocket jumps, change speed while jumping, ...) + you actually have to spend some time in the level and figure out how to solve it as quickly as possible + there are different ways to solve a level + worldwide Leaderboard in Multiplayer + the goal is to solve a level as quickly as possible, but the game also allows you to do the level on your own speed. That means you can also take all the time you need and do it really slow, what might help to find a good way to solve a level.What can be improved:  - At this moment only 7 levels (Will probably get better as soon as the Level Editor is implemented) - In some levels you have to look at the ground a lot, because of the rocket jumps. I know there is probably no different way to do this, but I don't really enjoy looking at the ground that much. But that might be also just me XDThe random talk:This game reminded me a little bit of Clustertruck when I first discovered it and I loved Clustertruck. And I have to say I wasn't wrong. I really enjoy playing the game and I really love the challenge that the game gives you. There is always a way to complete a level even faster than your last run!The only downside is currently, that there aren't too many levels (7 levels). But as soon as the Level Editor will be implemented I'm sure there will be a huge variety of levels to choose from, since everyone will be able to create their own levels then.The Multiplayer has a worldwide leaderboard by the way :) So it's made for all the speedrunners out there that wan't to show off their record time ;)			"

								*Really fun running and jumping game*So this game is about jumping, running and occasional rocket jumping. You can load up different maps and try to get the best time possible. This can also be done in multiplayers. This kinda reminds me of Trackmania, just without the cars.At first, it takes some time to get used to the engine. In fact, it does feel kinda clunky in the beginning. But once you get the hang of it the gameplay will feel pretty smooth and rewarding which is a ton of fun. You basically sprint most of the time while you bunnyhop from obstacle to obstacle. Bunnyhopping works by repressing jump mid-air and holding it (like in Reflex). Strafing works by just moving the mouse. Though, you can strafe extremely tight curves while keeping your speed which allows for some crazy movement (unlike in source engine where too tight curves cancel your air-strafe). Rocketjumping works like default arena shooters, but you can't use it to gain speed at the moment. Also, there's wall-jumping. All this makes speeding through the maps pretty fun already.The game offers great replayability value. First, it's about finishing a map. After that, it's about finding new skips and shorter routes and trying to finish those.Since it's early access and the Steam release was just yesterday, you can except a few bugs, like a clunky game-menu or keybindings not saving after a game restart (I remember even Overwatch having this same problem though lol). Though, there aren't any gameplay impairing bugs at the moment. You can also take a look at the public roadmap or the discord server to see when these bugs are getting fixed!So, if you like jumping/bunnyhopping mods/maps from other games you'll probably like this game too.

								Very fun so far! It's early access, but it has great platforming and gameplay, along with support across all OSes and relatively low PC requirements. But there is one thing I think should be added to the game:Splitscreen/Couch Multiplayer. Useful for parties and stuff. Preferably, splitscreen games could be online games and have other players join.I haven't seen anyone alse mention that, but I think it would be a great addition to the game. But obviously the main game and its levels should be worked on first. "

								This game is VERY good for being in early access. I cannot tell you how many games I have seenmake it to steam being EXTREMELY half-baked. This game, however, is definitely not on of those games. This game has very great potential and from the levels that have been published so far, it is very fun.INCLUDES:Singleplayer (For campaign)Multiplayer (Get the best time)Also, there is a discord link. You can get free games on it. I am just gonna point that out :3	So, overall, I would say this is a pretty good first person parkour game on its way to becoming a great one.			"

								I remember when i saw this game on the recomended section a while ago.... I was like.. ""The hell is this"" And then i saw it.. The cool looking gameplay of race-kinda-style game i always liked (Sort of like Quake 3 with the Defrag mod). I joined the Discord for further information and testing, It was a fantastic game even with some bugs on it that people would take to advantage for faster times (as any other game of course... Gotta go fast boi) For Early Access it's a fantastic game that it's worth the money... It has some good levels to start with, challenges to get faster times (like medals and more stuff in the future ;) ) but also that it's easy to understand the mechanics of the game to be really fast.. If you like parkour styled games mixed with platforms.. I cannot recommend this game highly enough..Give it a try, you will like it, its true that it might have some issues but that's why you have the discord.. To tell the dev and share your fastest times ;)			"

								Hello thereI was looking for a new parcour game to do speedruns. Well this is it. I have 2.3h in game right now and I love the game ! Of course their are some things that need to be fixed. And if you think the platinum times are to hard, they are not. Just re-try and find other shortcuts. I can see this game become big in the speedrunning community. Why? Because I saw that they were adding a speedrun mode in. Worth the money !  "

								Warning : You need to git gud in order to play this game. VThree is a jumping first person platformer. The goal is to reach the end of each map but the challenge comes to being SonicTheHedgehog himself.L̶e̶v̶e̶l̶s̶ ̶a̶r̶e̶ ̶o̶n̶l̶y̶ ̶7̶ ̶r̶i̶g̶h̶t̶ ̶n̶o̶w̶ ̶b̶u̶t̶ Since the last update we have 11 well designed and challenging levels. Dont expect to finish some stages unless you take it slow and wander around a bit so you can find the optimum path. That can even means to run on walls.Music is on point with the games mood. Got a sound effect volume settings along with the music one.Not especially newbie friendly. C̶u̶r̶r̶e̶n̶t̶l̶y̶ ̶l̶a̶c̶k̶s̶ ̶t̶u̶t̶o̶r̶i̶a̶l̶s̶ ̶b̶u̶t̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶y̶ ̶a̶r̶e̶ ̶a̶b̶o̶u̶t̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶b̶e̶ ̶a̶d̶d̶e̶d̶ ̶s̶o̶o̶n̶ Tutorials added. You need to spent a few hours to get used to it. Strafing, wall jumping, bhoping and boosts proper use isnt something you will master easily.Graphics are pretty. Not a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ so i cant really comment on that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯Overall game might have some imperfections but we are still in Early Access. Game progress can be found here https://trello.com/b/0Jr2Xyf6/vthree-public-roadmap or in the Discord server of the game. Level editor will be added soon.This review has been updated once.Solid 5/7			"

								VThree is in essence, what its advertised as. Its a fun game with excellent speedrunnning potential, and a soon to be  level editor. I see great potential in this game, since it is just pure fun. The developer is also one of the nicest people I've met in this community, and he actually takes feedback into consideration. I will just say, if you are expecting some AAA gameplay with motion blur and a million levels, you wont get it here. But considering it is only in early access so far it is pretty damn good.PROS:Fast game if you want it to beGreat communityGlobal leaderboards in multiplayer (and soon to be singleplayer)Decent amount of content and stability considering that its early accessCONS:Weird sounds (for now, i heard its being fixed)Other than the sounds i cant really say anything negative about the game. Great work Topher/MrWhoof :D			"

								DISCLAIMER FOR THOSE WITH LACK OF THINKNG: GAME IS IN EARY ACCESS, MEANING THERE WILL BE PROBLEMS BUT BECAUSE ITS EA THAT MEANS YOU CAN DO SOMETHING AND BRING UP SAID PROBLEMS AND HAVE THEM FIXED ASAP.Now back to my review. I got this game because I enjoy fast paced parkour styled game and this answers. My best comparison is faster paced source parkour but it's not exactly the same. There are fun lil gadgets that can help you reach your goal or you can just play around with them because screw the rules. As for the price tag, imagine being a father with children to feed, enough said. As far as issues go I don't have problems with it, it is a solid game for being made by one man. Ending thoughts: not everyone's cup o joe but give it a shot and if any tech issues come up just remember, YOU CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.			"

								The game itself has a load of potential, but the alfa does obviously have some bugs (the gravity jump not doing anything etc), but theone thing that i dont like is the time limitations for unlocking new levels. I ike the idea of trophies, but i feel like they should come after unlocking all the levels, or at least become a prioraty then. The way that these time limits work, is that, at first, you have to use shortcuts, meaning that sections of maps are rendered useless. All that aside, really fun game, a bit like cluster truck			"

								Pro:-gorgeous graphicsAs it currently stands, the jump physics are driving me crazy. It's early access, so maybe that will change.I found out about this game because I was playing Seum, which is more or less the same idea, except Seum has Super Meat Boy style traps. I have 600+ deaths on Seum in 2 hours of play. It's pretty difficult (though probably easier than SMB to be fair). Both games have you jumping platform to platform at fairly high speeds and have a variety of power ups.So why do I not like VThree?Simple: jump distance. It just doesn't feel right in VThree. In Seum, I can jump over numerous platforms, having to aim and lob grenades while I do it. I miss platforms all the time and die, but more often than not, I make individual jumps, just not a string of 12 when that happens.In VThree, by the second TUTORIAL level, I was already frustrated enough with the jumping that I exited the game. You can never just hit forward and jump at the right time, because the platforms aren't spaced relative to your jump distances. The next platform seems to be some awkward distance that's not even close.So if you're imagining rapid forward movement where you hold the W key and just hit space at the right time... this game isn't it. You have to not only jump at the right time, but also finesse exactly how far forward you're going. It's fiddly and it's frustrating. I'm failing jumps not because the jump itself looks difficult or because you're moving quickly and need to string a bunch of jumps together. Even basic jumps in this game are infuriating to me.I'm all for difficult games, but something is wrong if even the tutorial is frustratingly difficult.Now, it's early access, and one of the things they're going to change between now and release is ""Finalized Controls."" If they tweak the player's move speed / jump distance a little, with the same levels, I think I'd really like this game. But for now, having to nudge backwards while mid-air (or frequently let go of forward in an attempt to slow down so that you don't vastly overshoot the next platform) is a common sort of thing, and it's just not fun for me because of that. Almost all of these sorts of games have you more or less keep a constant move speed and relatively consistent jump distances.			"

								            Let me preface this by saying that yes, I do only have less than 10 minutes in the game. Now onto the problems that I had in said first 10 minutes.            1st. In-Game sounds and Music volume did not sync up for me. I could turn down the music volume but the game sounds would still be unbarebly loud. Obviously thats isn't supposed to happen.          2nd. None of the settings in which I could change actually did something. My FOV never changed when either increasing it or decreasing it. My sensitivity never changed when either increasing it or decreasing it. The very little graphics options available never had any effect on playability. I couldn't even change my keybindings. Nothing would save after being changed. Even after relaunching the game and reinstalling.          3rd. This game cost $10(off-sale). Now i understand that this game is in Early access, I do however believe that the problems that I was having should not be happeneing even in the current game state. I have requested a refund and will be getting my money back.            All that being said, I do very much enjoy these types of games(FPS 3D-Platformers) so much that I will definitely come back to this game once it has been fully released and plays like a dream. The best thing I can do now is to warn people about the current problems the game is having. I wish the best of luck to 2xMilk and his dev team and I truly hope that they can make this game as good as it looks.			"

								V3 is a game about FAST PACED QUICK PARKOUR WACHOW!You would be wrong.It's all the wrong Search vthree on YouTube. It's a slow parkour game that gives you boring abilities that aren't creative.GraphicsJust basic ones. No real effort in these graphics. They are very easy to make and don't show any effort nor passion. Wondering how the gameplay is? Here's a trailer for it. Let's see how fast paced the action isHere!(This isn't a official one, but captivates the experience well.)MusicI can't find it good. Just repetitive sound that drills right into your head. Sound effects CANNOT be disabled making a rather infuriating grunting noise ruin any other sound there is. No passion into it.FeaturesAbilitiesMovingJumpingBeing Bored!Speed running. That won't save this game. I doubt it will be anything but a stupid timer.Level editor. Will be just as bad as NMS, except a googolplex worse.Multiplayer I expect terror. A parkour game should not have multiplayer especially for how small the maps and platforms are on here. Mirrors edge is fine for multi. This game is not. It's extremely unrepeatable in terms of playing again. I believe that the vast majority who finish this game will not play again. It is a cash grabThese devs have no passion. End of.Developer is not capable of handling criticism and just insults and uses the family card to escape. How cowardly			"
